IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

STIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER FOR THE  
PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENTIAL 
AND HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 

WHEREAS, 

the  parties 

to 

the  above-captioned  action 

(the 

“Litigation”)  will  engage,  or  are  engaged,  in  discovery  proceedings,  which  may 

include,  among  other  things,  producing  documents,  responding  to  written 

discovery requests, and taking depositions and 

WHEREAS, those discovery proceedings may involve the production 

of certain information that one or more of the parties to the Litigation (collectively 

the  “Parties,”  and  each  a  “Party”)  believe  to  be  confidential  and  sensitive 

commercial, financial, or business information; 

IT  IS  HEREBY  STIPULATED  AND  AGREED,  by  the  Parties 

hereto,  through  their  undersigned  counsel,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Court, 

 
EXHIBIT 8 TO GUIDELINES

pursuant to Court of Chancery Rules 5.1 and 26(c), that this Stipulation and Order 

for  the  Production  and  Exchange  of  Confidential  and  Highly  Confidential 

Information (the “Stipulation”) will govern the handling of documents, deposition 

testimony,  deposition  exhibits,  deposition  transcripts,  written  discovery  requests, 

interrogatory  responses,  responses  to  requests  for  admissions,  and  responses  to 

requests  for  documents  and  electronically  stored  information,  and  any  other 

information or material produced, given or exchanged, including any information 

contained  therein  or  derived  therefrom  (“Discovery  Material”)  by  or  among  any 

Party or non-Party providing Discovery Material (each a “Producing Party”) in this 

Litigation. 

1. 

Any Producing Party may designate any Discovery Material as 

“Confidential” under the terms of this Stipulation if such Producing Party in good 

faith  and  reasonably  believes  that  such  Discovery  Material  contains  nonpublic, 

confidential,  personal,  business,  strategic,  proprietary,  or  commercially  sensitive 

information that requires the protections provided in this Stipulation (“Confidential 

Discovery Material”).  Any Producing Party may designate any Discovery Material 

as  “Highly  Confidential”  under  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation  if  such  Producing 

Party  in  good  faith  and  reasonably  believes  that  disclosure  of  the  Discovery 

Material  other  than  as  permitted  pursuant  to  Paragraph  6  of  this  Stipulation  is 

2 

 

 

substantially  likely  to  cause  injury  to  the  Producing  Party  (“Highly  Confidential 

Discovery Material”). 

2. 

The  designation  of  Discovery  Material  as  Confidential  or 

Highly Confidential Discovery Material shall be made in the following manner: 

a. 

In the case of documents or other materials (apart 

from  depositions  or  other  pre-trial  testimony):  (i)  by  affixing  the 

legend  “Confidential”  or  “Highly  Confidential” 

to  each  page 

containing  any  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery 

Material,  except  that  in  the  case  of  multi-page  documents  bound 

together by staple or other permanent binding, the word “Confidential”  

or “Highly Confidential” need only be stamped on the first page of the 

document in order for the entire document to be treated in accordance 

with  its  designation;  or  (ii)  in  the  case  of  electronically  stored 

information produced in native format, by including “Confidential” or 

“Highly Confidential” in the file or directory name, or by affixing the 

legend  “Confidential”  or  “Highly  Confidential” 

to 

the  media 

containing  the  Discovery  Material  (e.g.,  CD-ROM,  DVD  flash  drive) 

as applicable. 

b. 

In  the  case  of  depositions  or  other  pretrial 

testimony: (i) by a statement on the record, by counsel, at the time of 

3 

 

 

such disclosure or before the conclusion of the deposition or testimony; 

or (ii) by written notice, sent to all Parties within five (5) business days 

of receipt of the rough or final transcript (whichever is received first) 

designating the entire transcript or portions thereof; provided that only 

those  portions  of  the  transcript  designated  as  Confidential  or  Highly 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  shall  be  deemed  Confidential  or 

Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material.    All  depositions  and  other 

pretrial testimony will be deemed to be Highly Confidential Discovery 

Material  until  the  expiration  of  the  5th  business  day  after  counsel 

receive  a  copy  of  the  rough  or  final  transcript  (whichever  is  received 

first), after which such deposition and other pretrial testimony will be 

treated in accordance with its confidentiality designation, if any.  The 

Parties may modify this procedure for any deposition or other pretrial 

testimony,  through  agreement  on  the  record  at  such  deposition  or 

testimony, without further order of the Court. 

c. 

In  the  case  of  any  other  Discovery  Material,  by 

written  notice  that  the  Discovery  Material  constitutes  Confidential  or 

Highly Confidential Discovery Material, as applicable. 

3. 

The  designation  of  Discovery  Material  as  Confidential  or 

Highly Confidential Discovery Material shall constitute a representation that such 

4 

 

 

Discovery  Material  has  been  reviewed  by  an  attorney  representing  the  Party 

making the designation, and that there is a good faith basis for such designation. 

4. 

Inadvertent  failure 

to  designate  Discovery  Material  as 

Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  shall  not  constitute  a 

waiver  of  such  claim  and  may  be  corrected  promptly  upon  discovery  of  such 

failure.    A  Producing  Party  may  designate  as  “Confidential”  or  “Highly 

Confidential” any Discovery Material that has already been produced, including 

Discovery Material that the Producing Party inadvertently failed to designate as 

Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material,  (i)  by  notifying  in 

writing  the  Party  to  whom  the  production  has  been  made  that  the  Discovery 

Material  constitutes  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material,  or 

(ii) in a manner consistent with Paragraph 2.   The Party making the designation 

shall  mark  and  replace  previously  supplied  Discovery  Material.  Upon  receiving 

notice of the inadvertent failure to designate, the Parties shall thereafter treat the 

Discovery  Material  so  designated  as  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential 

Discovery  Material,  and  such  Discovery  Material  shall  be  fully  subject  to  this 

Stipulation  from  the  date  of  such  supplemental  notice  forward.    The  Party 

receiving such notice shall make a reasonable, good faith effort to ensure that any 

analyses, memoranda, notes, or other such materials generated based upon such 

newly designated information are immediately treated as containing Confidential 

5 

 

 

or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material.    In  addition,  upon  receiving  such 

supplemental  written  notice,  any  receiving  Party  that  disclosed  the  Discovery 

Material before its designation as Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery 

Material  shall  exercise  its  best  efforts  to  ensure  (i)  the  return  or  destruction  of 

such Discovery Material by any person not authorized to receive the Confidential 

or Highly Confidential Discovery Material under the terms of this Stipulation, (ii) 

that any documents or other materials derived from such Discovery Material are 

treated  as  if  the  Discovery  Material  had  been  designated  as  Confidential  or 

Highly Confidential Discovery Material when originally produced, (iii) that such 

Discovery Material is not further disclosed except in accordance with the terms 

of  this  Stipulation,  and  (iv)  that  any  such  Discovery  Material,  and  any 

information  derived  therefrom,  is  used  solely  for  the  purposes  described  in 

Paragraph 10 of this Stipulation. 

5.  Confidential  Discovery  Material  may 

be 

disclosed, 

summarized,  described,  characterized,  or  otherwise  communicated  or  made 

available in whole or in part only to the following persons for use in accordance 

with this Stipulation:

statement  on  the  record  by,  the  Producing  Party  who  provided  the 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  being  disclosed,  provided  that  such 

person signs an undertaking in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto. 

6.

only  to  the  extent  necessary  for  such  expert  or  consultant  to  prepare  a  written 

10 

 

 

opinion, to prepare to testify, or to assist counsel in this Litigation, provided that 

such  expert  or  consultant  (i)  is  not  currently  an  employee  of,  or  advising  or 

discussing  employment  with,  or  consultant  to  (aside  from  expert  services 

provided in connection with this Litigation), any Party or any known Competitor 

(as  defined  below)  or  potential  transaction  counterparty  of  the  Producing  Party

hereto.  Counsel for the Party showing, providing, or disclosing Confidential or 

Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  to  any  person  required  to  execute  an 

undertaking  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  responsible  for  obtaining  and 

retaining such signed undertaking before provision of the Confidential or Highly 

Confidential Material to such expert or consultant.  Under no circumstances shall 

an  expert  or  consultant  who  is  a  Competitor  of  the  Producing  Party,  or  who  is 

providing services to any of the foregoing, be provided access to Confidential or 

Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  absent  further  order  of  the  Court  or 

consent of the Producing Party.  “Competitors” are persons or entities engaged in 

the same or similar lines of business as the Producing Party.  

11 

 

 

9.  Notwithstanding  Paragraph  5(D)  and  6(C),  Confidential  or 

Highly Confidential Discovery Material may be provided to persons listed therein

signing an undertaking in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, or (ii) a court of 

competent  jurisdiction  orders  them  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation.  

Counsel  for  the  Party  showing  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery 

Material  to  any  person  required  to  execute  an  undertaking  pursuant  to  this 

paragraph  shall  be  responsible  for  obtaining  and  retaining  such  signed 

undertaking before the provision of such Highly Confidential Discovery Material 

to such person. 

10.  Confidential or Highly Discovery Material shall be used solely 

for  purposes  of  this  Litigation  and  shall  not  be  used  for  any  other  purpose, 

including,  without  limitation,  any  business  or  commercial  purpose;  provided, 

however,  that  the  foregoing  shall  not  apply  to  Confidential  or  Highly  Discovery 

Material that is or properly becomes part of the public record; and further provided 

that the restrictions on the use of Confidential Discovery Material may be modified 

for good cause shown. 

11.  Every  person  to  whom  Confidential  or  Highly  Discovery 

Material 

is  disclosed,  summarized,  described,  characterized,  or  otherwise 

12 

 

 

communicated  or  made  available,  in  whole  or  in  part,  shall  be  advised  that  the 

information is being disclosed pursuant and subject to the terms of this Stipulation 

and  may  not  be  disclosed  or  used  for  purposes  other  than  those  permitted 

hereunder.  Each such person shall maintain the Confidential or Highly Discovery 

Material,  or  information  derived  therefrom,  in  a  manner  reasonably  calculated  to 

prevent  unauthorized  disclosure.    Any  Party  issuing  a  subpoena  to  a  non-Party 

shall enclose a copy of this Stipulation and notify the non-Party that the protections 

of this Stipulation are available to such non-Party.  

12.  Any  pleading,  brief,  memorandum,  motion,  letter,  affidavit, 

exhibit  or  other  document  filed  with  the  Court  that  discloses,  summarizes, 

describes,  characterizes,  includes  or  attaches  or  otherwise  communicates 

Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material (a “Confidential Filing”) 

must  be  filed  confidentially  and  not  available  for  public  access  (“Confidential 

Treatment”)  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Court  of  Chancery  Rules  5.1 

and  79.1  and  the  Administrative  Directive  of  the  Chancellor  of  the  Court  of 

Chancery of the State of Delaware Amended No. 2003-1, dated March 15, 2007, 

regarding  e-File  Administrative  Procedures,  which  may  be  accomplished  by 

submitting documents, every page of which shall have a footer stating: 

THIS DOCUMENT IS A CONFIDENTIAL FILING.  
EXCEPT  AS 
PROHIBITED 
ACCESS 
AUTHORIZED BY COURT ORDER. 

IS 

13 

 

 

 

In  addition,  every  Confidential  Filing  must  be  submitted  with  a  cover  page 

bearing the title of the Litigation, the title of the Confidential Filing, and stating: 

YOU ARE IN POSSESSION OF A CONFIDENTIAL 
FILING  FROM  THE  COURT  OF  CHANCERY  OF 
THE STATE OF DELAWARE. 

If  you  are  not  authorized  by  Court  order  to  view  or 
retrieve  this  document,  read  no  further  than  this 
page.  You should contact the following person: 

[Filing Attorney or Party Name] 
[Filing Attorney Law Firm] 
[Filing Attorney or Party Address] 
[Filing Attorney or Party Telephone Number] 

If  a  public  version  of  the  Confidential  Filing  will  be  filed  in  accordance  with 

Court of Chancery Rule 5.1(d), then the cover page shall also state: 

A  public  version  of  this  document  will  be  filed  on  or 
before [DATE] 

If a paper copy of that document is to be submitted to the Court for any reason, 

that  document  shall  be  submitted  in  a  sealed  envelope  or  package  marked  with 

the  title  of  the  Litigation  and  bearing  a  statement  substantially  in  the  following 

form:

CONFIDENTIAL 

FILED UNDER SEAL PURSUANT TO A 
PROTECTIVE 

ORDER DATED ____________, 20__, GOVERNING 

CONFIDENTIALITY OF DOCUMENTS AND 
INFORMATION 

OBTAINED DURING THE COURSE OF THIS 
LITIGATION. 

THIS ENVELOPE IS NEITHER TO BE OPENED 
NOR THE CONTENTS THEREOF DISPLAYED 
OR REVEALED EXCEPT BY OR TO QUALIFIED 
PERSONS OR BY COURT ORDER. 

13.  Party  making  a  Confidential  Filing  must  comply  with  the 

provisions  of  Court  of  Chancery  Rule  5.1.  The  definition  of  Confidential  or 

Highly  Confidential  in  this  stipulation  may  encompass  Confidential  or  Highly 

Discovery  Information  that  falls  within  a  broader  range  of  material  than  is 

covered by Rule 5.1.  Nevertheless, when complying with Rule 5.1, parties must 

file a copy of the Confidential Filing for public inspection that omits only such 

Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  as  to  which  the 

Producing  Party  reasonably  and  in  good  faith  believes  the  public  interest  in 

access to Court proceedings is outweighed by the harm public disclosure of such 

Discovery  Material  would  cause  because  it  contains  sensitive,  non-public 

information.  For avoidance of doubt, the Parties have no obligation to file public 

versions of any exhibits, affidavits, declarations or other attachments filed as part 

15 

 

 

of a Confidential Filing, except as required by Court of Chancery Rule 5.1(f)(1) 

or if otherwise ordered by the Court or required by the Register in Chancery.  

14.  All  materials  filed  pursuant  to  Paragraph  12  shall  be  released 

from Confidential Treatment (as defined in Court of Chancery Rule 5.1) by the 

Register  in  Chancery  only  as  provided  in  Court  of  Chancery  Rules  5.1(d)  and 

5.1(g),  as  applicable,  or  upon  further  order  of  this  Court.    When  any  Party 

receives a notice from the Register in Chancery pursuant to Rule 5.1 concerning 

the  release  of  Confidential  Filings  that  were  filed  with  the  Court  by  such  Party 

but contain Discovery Material designated as Confidential or Highly Confidential 

Discovery  Material  by  another  Producing  Party,  the  Party  receiving  the  notice 

shall deliver a copy of such notice (by hand, email, or facsimile transmission) to 

counsel for the Producing Party (or Producing Parties) within three (3) business 

days  of  the  receipt  of  such  notice,  if  such  notice  is  not  otherwise  sent  to  such 

Producing  Party  by  the  Register  in  Chancery,  so  as  to  enable  the  latter  to  seek 

further  Confidential  Treatment  or  to  have  the  documents  returned  or  destroyed.  

The  provisions  of  this  Paragraph  may  be  waived  only  with  the  prior  written 

consent of the Producing Party. 

15.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Court  of  Chancery  Rule 

5.1(f), any Party who objects to the continued restriction on public access to any 

Confidential  Filing,  or  any  portion  thereof,  shall  give  written  notice  of  the 

16 

 

 

objection to the Producing Party.  If the Confidential Filing was a document for 

which  the  filing  of  a  public  version  was  not  required  under  Rule  5.1(d),  the 

Producing  Party  seeking  to  continue  the  restriction  on  public  access  to  the 

Confidential  Filing,  or  any  portion  thereof,  shall  provide  the  notices  and  public 

filings within the time periods required by Rule 5.1(f)(1).  To the extent that the 

Producing  Party  seeks  to  continue  the  restriction  on  public  access  to  the 

Confidential Filing, or any portion thereof, to which a public version is available, 

the Producing Party shall file a motion with the Court within the five-day period 

mandated  by  Court  of  Chancery  Rule  5.1(f)(2).    The  filing  of  the  motion 

constitutes  a  certification  that  the  signer  of  the  motion  personally  reviewed  the 

Confidential  Filing  and  that  continued  Confidential  Treatment  is  appropriate.  

The person challenging Confidential Treatment shall have five (5) days to file an 

opposition.  The Court shall then determine whether Confidential Treatment will 

be maintained, or whether a reply, hearing or further proceedings are warranted.  

If a motion seeking continued Confidential Treatment is not timely filed, then the 

Confidential  Filing  shall  become  part  of  the  public  record,  and  the  Register  in 

Chancery shall permit access to the Confidential Filing on the docket system to 

the same extent as any other public filing.  If an opposition to the motion is not 

timely filed, then the challenge shall be deemed withdrawn and the Confidential 

Filing shall continue to receive Confidential Treatment.  

17 

 

 

16.  During the pendency of this Litigation, any Party objecting to 

the designation of any Discovery Material as Confidential or Highly Confidential 

Discovery  Material  may,  after  making  a  good  faith  effort  to  resolve  any  such 

objection,  move  on  reasonable  notice  for  an  order  vacating  the  designation.  

While  such  a  motion  is  pending,  the  Discovery  Material  in  question  shall  be 

treated  as  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  pursuant  to 

this Stipulation.  The provisions of this Stipulation are not intended to shift any 

burdens  of  proof,  including  the  burden  of  establishing  that  any  Discovery 

Material  validly  constitutes  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery 

Material,  which  burden  remains  on  the  Producing  Party  that  designates  such 

Discovery Material as Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material. 

17.  The Parties reserve the right to apply, upon short notice, for an 

order  seeking  additional  safeguards  with  respect  to  the  use  and  handling  of 

Discovery Material or to modify the terms of this Stipulation.  The Parties agree 

to meet and confer in good faith prior to moving the Court for any modifications 

or additional safeguards. 

18.  Entering into this Stipulation, or agreeing to and/or producing 

or receiving Discovery Material (regardless of confidentiality designation, if any) 

or otherwise complying with the terms of this Stipulation, shall not: 

18 

 

 

a. 

Prejudice in any way the rights of any Party to (i) 

seek  production  of  documents  or  information  the  Party  considers 

subject  to  discovery,  or  (ii)  object  to  the  production  of  documents  or 

information it considers not subject to discovery; 

b. 

Operate  as  an  admission  by  any  Party  that  any 

Discovery  Material  constitutes  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential 

Discovery  Material  or  contains  or  reflects  trade  secrets  or  any  other 

type of confidential information; 

c. 

Prejudice in any way the rights of any Party to (i) 

petition  the  Court  for  a  further  protective  order  relating  to  any 

purportedly Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material, or 

(ii) seek a determination by the Court whether any Discovery Material 

(regardless of confidentiality designation, if any) should be subject to 

the terms of this Stipulation; 

d. 

Prevent any Party from agreeing in writing to alter 

or waive the provisions or protections provided herein with respect to 

any Discovery Material; 

e. 

Prejudice  in  any  way  the  rights  of  any  Party  to 

object to the relevance, authenticity, use, or admissibility into evidence 

19 

 

 

of  any  document,  testimony,  or  other  evidence  subject  to  this 

f. 

Preclude  any  Party  from  objecting  to  discovery 

that it believes to be otherwise improper; or 

g. 

Operate  as  a  waiver  of  any  attorney-client,  work 

product, business strategy, trade secret, or other privilege immunity or 

Stipulation;  

protection. 

19.  This  Stipulation  has  no  effect  upon,  and  shall  not  apply  to,  a 

Producing  Party’s  use  or  disclosure  of  its  own  Discovery  Material  for  any 

purpose.  Nothing herein shall: (i) prevent a Producing Party from disclosing its 

own Confidential or Highly Discovery Material; or (ii) impose any restrictions on 

the  use  or  disclosure  by  any  person  of  documents,  materials,  or  information 

designated  as  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  obtained 

lawfully  by  such  person  independently  of  the  discovery  proceedings  in  this 

Litigation, and not otherwise subject to confidentiality restrictions. 

20.  If  Discovery  Material  that  is  subject  to  a  claim  of  attorney-

client  privilege,  attorney  work  product,  or  any  other  applicable  privilege  or 

immunity or ground on which production of that information should not be made 

to any Party (“Inadvertent Production Material”) is inadvertently produced to that 

Party  or  Parties,  such  inadvertent  production  shall  in  no  way  prejudice  or 

20 

 

 

otherwise  constitute  a  waiver  of,  or  estoppel  as  to,  any  claim  of  attorney-client 

privilege,  work  product,  or  other  applicable  privilege  or  immunity;  provided 

further: 

a. 

A  claim  of  inadvertent  production  shall  constitute 

a  representation  by 

that  Producing  Party 

that 

the  Inadvertent 

Production  Material  has  been  reviewed  by  an  attorney  for  such 

Producing Party and that there is a good faith basis for such claim of 

inadvertent production. 

b. 

If  a  claim  of  inadvertent  production  is  made 

pursuant to this Stipulation, with respect to Discovery Material then in 

the  custody  of  another  Party,  the  Party  possessing  the  Inadvertent 

Production  Material  shall:  (i)  refrain  from  any  further  examination  or 

disclosure  of  the  claimed  Inadvertent  Production  Material;  (ii)  if 

requested,  promptly  make  a  good-faith  effort  to  return  the  claimed 

Inadvertent  Production  Material  and  all  copies  thereof  (including 

summaries and excerpts) to counsel for the Producing Party, or destroy 

all such claimed Inadvertent Production Material (including summaries 

and excerpts) and all copies thereof, and certify in writing to that fact; 

and  (iii)  not  use  the  Inadvertent  Production  Material  for  any  purpose 

until further order of the Court. 

21 

 

 

c. 

A  Party  may  move  the  Court  for  an  order 

compelling production of the claimed Inadvertent Production Material; 

and may retain a copy of the material on an attorney’s-eyes-only basis 

for  the  purpose  of  bringing  such  a  motion;    however,  while  such 

motion is pending, the Discovery Material in question shall be treated 

as Inadvertent Production Material, and such motion may not assert as 

a  ground  for  entering  such  an  order  the  fact  or  circumstance  of  the 

inadvertent  production,  nor  shall  such  motion  include  or  otherwise 

disclose,  as  an  attachment,  exhibit,  or  otherwise,  the  Inadvertent 

Production Material (or any portion thereof) that is the subject of such 

motion.  

21.  Nothing  herein  shall  be  deemed  to  waive  any  applicable 

common law or statutory privilege or work product protection. 

22.  In  the  event  additional  Parties  join  or  are  joined  in  this 

Litigation,  they  shall  not  have  access  to  Confidential  or  Highly  Discovery 

Material until the newly joined Party by its counsel has executed and filed with 

the Court its agreement to be bound fully by this Stipulation. 

23.  The Parties agree to be bound by the terms of this Stipulation 

pending the entry by the Court of this Stipulation, and any violation of its terms 

22 

 

 

shall be subject to the same sanctions and penalties as if this Stipulation had been 

entered by the Court. 

24.  Subject to the requirements of Court of Chancery Rules 5.1(g) 

and  any  applicable  rule  of  the  Delaware  Supreme  Court,  the  provisions  of  this 

Stipulation  shall,  absent  written  permission  of  the  Producing  Party  or  further 

order of the Court, continue to be binding throughout and after the conclusion of 

the  Litigation,  including,  without  limitation,  any  appeals  therefrom,  except  as 

provided in Paragraph 25. 

25.  In the event that any Confidential or Highly Discovery Material 

is used in open court during any court proceeding or lodged as a trial exhibit, the 

material  shall  lose  its  confidential  status  and  become  part  of  the  public  record, 

unless  the  Producing  Party  applies  for  and  obtains  an  order  from  this  Court 

specifically  maintaining  the  confidential  status  of  particular  material.    Prior  to 

any  court  proceeding  in  which  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery 

Material is to be used, counsel for the Parties shall confer in good faith on such 

procedures  that  may  be  necessary  or  advisable  to  protect  the  confidentiality  of 

any such Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material. 

26.  Within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the entry of an 

order,  judgment,  or  decree  finally  disposing  of  this  Litigation,  or  any  other 

proceeding  in  which  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  is 

23 

 

 

permitted to be used, including the exhaustion of all possible appeals, and upon 

the  written  request  of  the  Producing  Party,  all  persons  having  received 

Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  shall  either  (i)  make  a 

good-faith  and  reasonable  effort  to  return  such  material  and  all  copies  thereof 

(including  summaries,  excerpts,  and  derivative  works)  to  counsel  for  the 

Producing  Party;  or  (ii)  make  a  good-faith  and  reasonable  effort  to  destroy  all 

Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material,  and  if  so  requested,  to 

certify  to  that  fact  in  writing  to  counsel  for  the  Producing  Party.    However, 

counsel for the Parties shall be entitled to retain court papers, deposition and trial 

transcripts,  and  litigation  files  (including  attorney  work  product  and  discovery 

material  containing  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material), 

provided  that  such  counsel,  and  employees  of  such  counsel,  shall  maintain  the 

confidentiality thereof and shall not disclose such court papers, correspondence, 

pleadings, depositions and trial transcripts, and litigation files (including attorney 

work  product  and  discovery  material  containing  Confidential  or  Highly 

Confidential Discovery Material), to any person except pursuant to a court order, 

agreement by the Producing Party, or as otherwise required by law.  For purposes 

of this Paragraph, good faith reasonable efforts to return or destroy material need 

not  include  destroying  Discovery  Material  residing  on  back-up  tapes  or  other 

disaster recovery systems, so long as the person who has received such Discovery 

24 

 

 

Material maintains the confidentiality of such material.  All materials returned to 

the  Parties  or  their  counsel  by  the  Court  likewise  shall  be  disposed  of  in 

accordance with this Paragraph. 

27.  If  any  person  subject 

to  Stipulation 

in  possession  of 

Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material (the “Receiver”) receives 

a  subpoena  or  other  compulsory  process  seeking  the  production  or  other 

disclosure of Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material produced or 

designated  by  a  Producing  Party  other  than  the  Receiver  (collectively,  a 

“Demand”), the Receiver shall give written notice (by hand, email, or facsimile 

transmission)  to  counsel  for  the  Producing  Party  (or  Producing  Parties)  within 

three  (3)  business  days  of  receipt  of  such  Demand  (or  if  a  response  to  the 

Demand is due in less than three (3) business days, at least twenty-four (24) hours 

prior to the deadline for a response to the Demand), identifying the Confidential 

or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material  sought  and  enclosing  a  copy  of  the 

Demand,  and  must  object  to  the  production  of  the  Confidential  or  Highly 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  on  the  grounds  of  the  existence  of  this 

Stipulation.  The burden of opposing the enforcement of the Demand will fall on 

the Producing Party.  Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Receiver 

or  anyone  else  covered  by  this  Stipulation  to  challenge  or  appeal  any  order 

requiring  production  of  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material 

25 

 

 

covered by this Stipulation, or to subject itself to any penalties for noncompliance 

with any legal process or order, or to seek any relief from this Court or any other 

court.  Compliance by the Receiver with any order directing production pursuant 

to a Demand of any Confidential or Highly Confidential Discovery Material will 

not constitute a violation of this Stipulation. 

28.  No  Receiver  shall  reveal  any  Confidential  or  Highly 

Confidential Discovery Material, or the information contained therein, to anyone 

not  entitled  to  receive  such  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery 

Material  under  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation.    In  the  event  that  Confidential  or 

Highly Confidential Discovery Material is disclosed to any person other than in 

the  manner  authorized  by  this  Stipulation,  or  that  any  information  comes  to  the 

Receiver’s  attention  that  may  indicate  there  was  or  is  likely  to  be  a  loss  of 

confidentiality  of  any  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery  Material, 

the  Receiver  responsible  for  the  disclosure  or  loss  of  confidentiality  shall 

immediately  inform  the  Producing  Party  of  all  pertinent  facts  relating  to  the 

disclosure or loss of confidentiality, including, if known, the name, address, and 

employer  of  each  person  to  whom  the  disclosure  was  made.    The  Receiver 

responsible for the disclosure or loss of confidentiality shall also make reasonable 

efforts  to  prevent  disclosure  of  Confidential  or  Highly  Confidential  Discovery 

Material by each unauthorized person who receives the information. 

26 

 

 

29.  The Parties agree that the production of any Discovery Material 

by  any  non-Party  shall  be  subject  to  and  governed  by  the  terms  of  this 

Stipulation. 

5.1, Rule 5.1 shall control.   

30.  To the extent of any conflict between this Stipulation and Rule 

31.  This  Stipulation,  and  any  dispute  arising  out  of  or  relating  in 

any  way  to  this  Stipulation,  whether  in  contract,  tort,  or  otherwise,  shall  be 

governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, 

without regard to conflict of laws principles.  Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably 

submits  to  the  personal  jurisdiction  of  any  state  or  federal  court  sitting  in  the 

State of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal 

may be taken from such courts, in any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or 

relating  to  this  Stipulation,  (ii)  agrees  that  all  claims  in  respect  of  such  suit, 

action, or proceeding shall be brought, heard, and determined exclusively in the 

Delaware  Court  of  Chancery  (provided  that,  in  the  event  that  subject  matter 

jurisdiction  is  unavailable  in  that  court,  then  all  such  claims  shall  be  brought, 

heard, and determined exclusively in any other state or federal court sitting in the 

State  of  Delaware),  (iii)  agrees  that  it  shall  not  attempt  to  deny  or  defeat  such 

personal  jurisdiction  by  motion  or  other  request  for  leave  from  such  court,  (iv) 

agrees not to bring any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this 

27 

 

 

 

Stipulation in any other court, and (v) expressly waives, and agrees not to plead 

or to make any claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding is subject (in whole 

or in part) to a jury trial.  Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient 

forum  to  the  maintenance  of  any  suit,  action,  or  proceeding  brought  in 

accordance with this Paragraph.  Each of the Parties further agrees to waive any 

bond,  surety,  or  other  security  that  might  be  required  of  any  other  party  with 

respect to any suit, action, or proceeding, including, without limitation, an appeal 

thereof.  Each of the Parties further consents and agrees that process in any suit, 

action,  or  proceeding  may  be  served  on  such  Party  by  certified  mail,  return 

receipt requested, addressed to such Party or such Party’s registered agent in the 

state of its incorporation or organization, or in any other manner provided by law.
