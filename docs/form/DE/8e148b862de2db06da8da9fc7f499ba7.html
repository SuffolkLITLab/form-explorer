A motion is a petition for some type of relief, or some action, you ask the Court to grant you; it also 
may be a request for the Court to take notice of certain facts.  A sample motion is attached. 

There are several documents that you must prepare when filing a motion.  They are: 
 

1) Notice of Motion 
 

The notice advises the other party that a motion will be filed, what it will be about, what facts will be 
offered, and when it will be presented to the Court. This gives the other side the opportunity to 
prepare a response.  It also advises the Court and the other party of the date and time the motion 
will be heard. 
 
2) The Motion 
  

 

The actual body of the motion states your request and explains the reasons for making the request. 
As some motions may require affidavits, please refer to the Court of Common Pleas Civil Rules 
 
found in the Delaware Code Annotated, which is available at any law library or public library. 

 

COURT OF COMMON PLEAS 
 
 
HOW TO PREPARE A CIVIL MOTION 
 

The order is a document signed by the judge granting the request made in the motion.  You must 
prepare it in advance so the judge can sign it, if the motion is granted. 

 
3) Order 
 

 
4) Certificate of Service 
 

This is a notarized document; it states that you did notify the other party of your intent to file a 
motion and that you did provide the other party with copies of all the documents you are filing. 
 

5)  Exhibits 
 

As Needed/Optional: 

 

 

Exhibits may be any item of evidence that supports your position. These may be contracts, letters, 
photographs, receipts, etc. 
_______________________________________________________________________________  
To file a motion, you will need to file one original set and one copy of all the required documents 
listed above.  In addition, you must provide two copies of all the documents to the other party. 
 
Keep a copy for your file. 
 
•	  You must arrange to copy all these documents, as the Court is unable to make copies for you. 
 
 
•	  The  Court  is  unable  to  provide  you  with  legal  advice.  If  you  require  further  clarification  to 
 
prepare your motion, you may contact the Legal Help Link at (302) 478-8850 for New Castle 
County or (800) 773-0606  for Kent and Sussex counties. 

 
•	  Dispositive motions (motions, that if granted, would conclude the case) must be filed with the 
 

Court at least thirteen (13) days before the hearing is scheduled to be heard. 

 
•	  Non-dispositive motions (motions, that if granted, would not conclude the case) must be filed 
 

with the Court at least six (6) days before the hearing is scheduled to be heard. 

CAPTION INFORMATION 

 
The following is the Caption portion of any pleading* presented to the Court. It does not change 
unless the case changes. Therefore, for any motion pertaining to an ongoing case, always use the 
same caption for the motion itself and each of its required components (Notice, the Motion, Order 
 
and Certificate of Service.)

TITLE OF THE MOTION 
 
(See attached sample) 

   

___________________________________________________________________________ 
* A “pleading” is part of a series of statements and answers, or counter-statements, made by the 
various parties to a lawsuit; these documents follow a specific format.  For example, the initial 
complaint in a case is a pleading; the answer filed by the other side is also a pleading. 
 
** If several names are listed for Plaintiffs and/or Defendants, you must use the name listed first on 
the original pleading in the Plaintiff space and in the Defendant space, but you may add et al. 
instead of copying all the other names. For example, if John Doe, Jane Smith, Dr. Harry Brown, 
XYZ Hospital and ABC Company are all listed as Defendants on the first Complaint, in subsequent 
documents, such as your motion, you can write: John Doe, et al., Defendants.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
