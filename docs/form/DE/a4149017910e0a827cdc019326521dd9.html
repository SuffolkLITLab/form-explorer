JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT APPEALS OF CIVIL CASES TO THE  
 
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS 

 

  

   

                                     

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 

   

All  decisions  from  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  Court  civil  matters,  except 
 
landlord/tenant possession cases, may be appealed to the Court of Common 
Pleas  in  the  county  in  which  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  Court  is  located.    The 
landlord/tenant  cases  MUST  be  appealed  to  a  three  judge  panel  of  Justices  of 
the  Peace.    Appeals  to  this  Court  are  “de  novo,”  meaning  that  the  case  starts 
over in the Court of Common Pleas.  (Court of Common Pleas Civil Rule 72.3(a)) 

The party who is appealing the Justice of the Peace Court decision is the 
“Appellant.”    The  party  whose  role  it  is  to  respond  to  the  appeal  filed  by  the 
Appellant is the “Appellee.” 

The named parties and issues outlined in the appeal must be filed exactly 
as  it  was  in  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  Court.    Parties  must  comply  with  the 
requirements  of  Civil  Rule  72.3  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure.   

Corporations  must  be  represented  by  legal  counsel  in  the  Court  of 

Common Pleas. 

All filing fees filed with the Court are non-refundable.  

 

  

   

   

   

                                             

APPEALS FROM JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT CIVIL CASES 
 
DEFENDANT BELOW INSTRUCTIONS 
 

To appeal a decision from a Justice of Peace Court civil matter, the 

Defendant Below must file within fifteen (15) days the following: 
 

  A  Notice  of  Appeal.   This  must  be filed  within  fifteen  (15)  days 

after the date of the decision in the Justice of the Peace Court.   
The  notice  has  to  be  filed  in  the  Clerk’s  Office  of  the  Court  of 
Common Pleas and must include an original and one copy.     

  An  original  Praecipe  and  one  (1)  copy.    A  Praecipe  is  a 
document which tells the Sheriff where to serve the parties.   

  An original Summons on Appeal and one (1) copy for each party 
to  be  served.    The  Summons  on  Appeal  is  the  document  that 
the Sheriff will serve with the pleadings.   

At  the  same  time,  or  within  ten  (10)  additional  days,  the  Defendant 

 
Below must: 
 

 

   

 

  Pay  a  non-refundable  $135.00  filing  fee  (including  the  Court 
Security  Assessment.)  Payments  can  be  made  with  check, 
cash,  or  money  order.  Currently,  we  are  unable  to  accept 
credit/debit  card  payments at  the  Court.  All  checks  must  be 
made payable to the “Court of Common Pleas.”  

  Pay a separate non-refundable check made payable to “Sheriff.” 

Sheriff costs are as follows: 

If  you  are  serving  more  than  one  person,  the  costs  are 
$30.00  for  the  first  address  and  $30.00  for  each  additional 
address.    There  is  a  $5.00  fee  for  each  additional  person 
served at the same address. 
 

  The Appellant shall, within ten (10) calendar days, file a copy of 

the Notice of Appeal with the Justice of the Peace Court. 

 

   

 

 

 

After all the pleadings mentioned above have been served on the Plaintiff 
Below, he or she will have twenty (20) days in which to file the Complaint with the 
Court  and  serve  a  copy  on  you.    Pleadings  are  written  statements  in  which  a 
party  to  a  lawsuit  sets  forth  or  responds  to  claims,  allegations,  denials  and 
defenses.    When  you  receive  the  Complaint,  you  will  have  twenty  (20)  days  in 

which to file an Answer to it.  If the Plaintiff Below fails to file a Complaint, see the 
“How to Prepare a Civil Motion” packet available in the Clerk’s Office and also on 
the Court’s web site at http://courts.delaware.gov/CommonPleas/index.stm.  You 
must  file  your  Answer  with  the  Clerk’s  Office  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas.  
Your Answer must include notice to the Court that you have served a copy on the 
Plaintiff (See attached sample Certificate of Service.)    

 
Once the Complaint and Answer are both filed, you will be notified by the 
 
Court of a date of a pre-trial conference with a judicial officer and the other party. 

  

 
 

WHAT IS A PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE? 

If  the  Defendant  Below  answers  the  Complaint,  the  case  may  be 
scheduled for a pre-trial conference.  At the conference, the parties will meet with 
a  judicial  officer  in  an  attempt  to  narrow  the  issues,  determine  the  number  of 
witnesses  to  be  called,  the  length  of  the  trial,  and  to  discuss  the  possibility  of 
settlement. 
 

If a pre-trial conference is scheduled, you will receive notice of the date by 
mail  along  with  a  Civil  Case  Management  Order,  which  must  be  completed  by 
the  parties  and  returned  to  the  Court  five  (5)  days  before  the  scheduled 
conference.   A completed copy of the Civil Case Management Order must also 
be mailed or hand-delivered to the opposing party or to the attorney representing 
the party.     

WHAT HAPPENS IF I FAIL TO FILE THESE DOCUMENTS  

AND PAY ALL FEES? 

 

Your appeal cannot proceed until you have complied with all instructions.  
If  you  fail  to  file  any  of  the  required  documents  or  submit  the  appropriate  fees, 
your appeal will be dismissed by the Court.   All filing fees are non-refundable. 

   

   

WHAT HAPPENS IF A MONEY JUDGMENT WAS RENDERED AGAINST ME 

IN THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT AND I WISH TO APPEAL? 

 
 
If a money judgment was rendered against you in the Justice of the Peace 
Court  and  you  want  to  stop  execution  on  the  judgment,  you  must  file  a  motion 
with  the  Clerk’s  Office  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  requesting  a  stay  of  the 
Justice  of  the  Peace  Court  judgment.    The  motion  must  be  accompanied  by  a 
surety or cash deposit sufficient to cover the amount of the Justice of the Peace 
Court judgment, plus interest and court costs.  The judgment will be stayed if the 

 

     

 

 

motion and the surety are filed and approved by a judge of this Court.  If you do 
not  file  such  a  motion,  execution  of  the  judgment  can  proceed  against  you.  
(Court of Common Pleas Civil Rule 62(c))

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
