      <pre>A Guide to Expungement of Adult Record 

Expungement of an Adult Record 

State of Delaware Superior Court 

An expungement is the way in which all law enforcement agency records and court 
records  relating  to  a  case  are  shielded  from  general  view.  If  an  expungement  is 
granted, you will not be required to disclose that you were arrested for, charged 
with, or convicted of an offense for which records have been expunged, except as 
provided in section 4376 of Title 11.    

n Delaware, Subchapter VII of Chapter 43 of Title 11 of the Delaware Code governs 
the process of petitioning for expungement of an adult record. 

Two Types of Adult Expungement 

There are two types of expungements. The first type is a Mandatory Expungement. 
The second type is a Discretionary Expungement.     

Mandatory Expungements – The State Bureau of Identification (SBI) handles 
mandatory  expungements.  For  detailed  information  on  the  mandatory 
expungement process, please see page 8.     

Discretionary  Expungement  -  Superior  Court  and  Family  Court  handle 
discretionary expungements. If your case does not qualify for a mandatory 
expungement,  you  may  still  qualify  for  a  discretionary  expungement.  A 
discretionary  expungement  means  that  the  Attorney  General’s  office  will 
have an opportunity to respond to your petition, and the Court will weigh 
the  facts  of  your  case  to  determine  whether  the  petition  is  granted.  The 
Court may choose to hold a hearing to determine whether an expungement 
will be granted. For detailed information on the discretionary expungement 
process, please see page 9.

In which Court do I file my discretionary expungement petition? 

If all the charges and convictions sought to be expunged were disposed of in Family 
Court, then you must file in Family Court in the county where your most recent case 
was terminated. If  you have any charges or convictions outside of Family Court, 
then you must file in Superior Court in the county where your most recent case was 
terminated for all charges and convictions.     

Where can I go for help and additional information on the expungement process?  

APEX is a state program funded by the Division of Social Services and the Division 
of Vocational Rehabilitation. APEX can:  

  Provide an overview of pardons and expungements. 
  Guide you through the process. 
  Assist with obtaining documents and completing paperwork. 
  Offer preparation classes for Board of Pardons hearings. 
  Connect you to the Job Center's free employment classes and resources. 

Additional  information,  including  how  to  contact  APEX,  can  be  found  at: 
https://apex.delawareworks.com/index.php 

Are  there  reasons  why  I  might  be  unable  to  request  either  a  mandatory  or  a 
discretionary expungement?  

Yes,  the  law  provides  that  you  may  not  request  either  a  mandatory  or  a 
discretionary expungement if any of the following apply: 

1.  You have pending charges.   

(There is an exception if you are seeking an expungement related to an arrest 
for which no charges were filed in any Court within a year of that arrest.) 
  
Additionally,  “pending  charges”  does  not  include  alleged  violations  of  the 
following: Section 904(e) or (f) of Title 4, Section 4764(c) of Title 16, or Title 21. 
 

2.  You are currently serving a term of incarceration, parole, or probation.

3.  You received an expungement of a prior conviction within the previous 10 years.   
(This  limitation  will  not  exclude  a  person  from  receiving  a  mandatory  expungement  if  the 
mandatory expungement application relates to a case which was terminated in favor of the 
accused. (11 Del. C. §§ 4372(f)(4) and 4373(a)(1).)  

.  You  received  an  expungement  for  a  felony  conviction,  and  you  are  seeking 

  4

expungement of a new felony conviction. 
 

5.  You owe fines, fees or restitution associated with your conviction. 

(If the fine is not yet satisfied for reasons other than willful noncompliance, the Court may 
waive the fines and fees or convert the obligation to a civil judgement. An applicant would 
have to apply to the Court for this relief.)   
 

6.  You  want  to  expunge  Title  21  offenses.  A  Title  21  offense  is  not  expungable 

unless it is one of the following: 
 

a.  Driving after judgment prohibited (21 Del. C. § 2810) 
b.  Reckless driving (21 Del. C. § 4175) 
c.  Operation of a motor vehicle causing death (21 Del. C. § 4176A) 

7.  You  have  been  convicted  of  any  of  the  following  unless  you  received  an 

   

unconditional pardon: 
 

a.  Vehicular assault in the second degree (11 Del. C. § 628A) 
b.  Incest (11 Del. C. § 766)  
c.  Unlawful sexual contact in the third degree (11 Del. C. § 767)  
d.  Coercion (11 Del. C. § 791) 
e.  Unlawfully dealing with a child (11 Del. C. § 1106)

misdemeanors or violations found in Titles 4, 7, 11, 16 or 23 of the Delaware Code 
in any of the three following situations: 

1.  When a person is arrested or charged with 1 or more felony, misdemeanor or 
violation crimes and the case is terminated in the person’s favor. “Terminated 
in favor” means any of the following:  
 

a.  The accused is acquitted of all charges related to the case. 
b.  A nolle prosequi is entered on all charges related to the case.  
c.  The  accused  is  placed  on  probation  before  judgment,  fulfills the  terms 
and conditions of probation, and the court enters an order discharging 
the person from probation.  

d.  All charges related to the case are otherwise dismissed. 
e.  The accused is acquitted of 1 or more charges related to the case, and the 
other charges are dismissed by the entry of a nolle prosequi or otherwise.  
f.  The accused is arrested for the commission of 1 or more crimes and no 
charges related to the matter for which the person was arrested are filed 
in any court within 1 year of the arrest. 

*SBI shall expunge a case terminated in favor of the accused even if a person has 
prior or subsequent convictions that are ineligible for expungement. 

2.  When: 

a.  A person is convicted of 1 or more violations relating to the same case. 
b.  3 years have passed since the date of conviction; and 
c.  A person has “no prior or subsequent convictions.” 

(Prior or subsequent convictions for a Title 21 offense or offenses under Sections 904(e) or 
(f) of Title 4 (regarding underage possession or consumption of alcohol) or a conviction 
under Section 4764(c) of Title 16 (regarding underage possession of personal use quantity

Section 4764 of Title 16 or such similar statute, law, or ordinance, provided the 
applicant  is  otherwise  eligible  for  a  mandatory  expungement  as  provided  in

Discretionary Expungement

1.  3  years  have  passed  from  the  date  of  your  conviction  or  release  from 

incarceration whichever is later, and

How  will  the  Court  decide  whether  to  grant  my  Petition  for  Discretionary 
Expungement? 

If you are otherwise eligible, the Court will grant a discretionary expungement if it 
finds  that  the  continued  existence  and  giving  out  of  the  related  criminal 
information causes, or may cause, you a manifest injustice.   

hat is manifest injustice?  

Manifest  injustice  essentially  means  hardship.  Manifest  injustice  on 
the  expungement  petition  refers  to  the  harm  caused  by  having  a 
record, not the circumstances surrounding your arrest.   

hat do I have to explain to show manifest injustice?  

You must explain why having a record is causing you difficulties in your 
life or holding you back in some way, including but not limited to:  

♦ Problems with Finding a Job  

♦ Gaining Admission to College or Vo-Tech Programs  

*** NOTE: When completing your petition, please do not use the space provided 
to discuss the facts of your arrest or the circumstances concerning the charges. ***

f  I  file  a  Petition  for  Discretionary  Expungement,  will  the  Court  grant  the 
expungement automatically?  

Not necessarily. Once your petition is filed, a copy of your petition will be provided 
to the Attorney General’s Office. The Attorney General’s Office will then have 120 
days to file an Answer. In its Answer, the Attorney General’s Office will have the 
opportunity  to  oppose  your  request.  If  the  Attorney  General’s  Office  files  an 
Answer, you will then have 30 days to file a Reply. The Court will consider both your 
position and that of the Attorney General’s Office in deciding your petition.

Will  the  Court  hold  a  hearing  regarding  my  Petition  for  Discretionary 
Expungement? 

The Court will hold a hearing only if the Court believes it is necessary. If the Court 
finds  your  petition  is  eligible  for  a  discretionary  expungement  and  that  the 
continued giving out of the record causes you a manifest injustice, it will enter an 
order requiring the expungement of the police and court records.  Otherwise, it will 
deny the Petition. Often this is done without a hearing. 

What  if  I  qualify  for  both  a  mandatory  expungement  and  a  discretionary 
expungement? 

You may apply to both SBI, for the mandatory expungement, and the Court, for the 
discretionary  expungement.  You  may  also  include  a  case  that  is  eligible  for 
mandatory  expungement  in  your  petition  for  discretionary  expungement.  The 
Court may address both the mandatory and discretionary expungement requests. 
11 Del. C. § 4374(d)(2). 

What will happen if my expungement is granted? 

If the Court enters an Order granting your Petition for Discretionary Expungement, 
then all law-enforcement agency records and Court records relating to the case(s) 
and the charge or set of charges related to that case(s), including fingerprints and 
photographs, will be shielded from view.   

If a potential employer does a criminal background check through the State Bureau 
of Identification, there will be no evidence on record with the Court or other State 
agencies relating to the expunged case(s) and the charge or set of charges related 
to that case(s). 

What is a pardon? 

A  pardon  is  an  official  statement  of  forgiveness  of  your  offense  issued  by  the 
Governor. A pardon does NOT remove the conviction from your official records; 
however, a pardon will generally restore your civil rights, such as the rights to vote 
and hold public office. A pardon may remove barriers to employment, professional 
licensing, public housing, social services, education, and other opportunities.

I received a pardon from the Governor, am I eligible to apply for a discretionary 
expungement? 

If  you  received  an  unconditional  pardon  from  the  Governor,  you  are  eligible  to 
request a discretionary expungement unless you would be seeking to expunge any 
of the following: 

a)  Manslaughter (11 Del. C. § 632)  

b)  Murder in the second degree (11 Del. C. § 635) 

c)  Murder in the first degree (11 Del. C. § 636)  

d)  Rape in the second degree (11 Del. C. § 772)  

e)  Rape in the first degree (11 Del. C. § 773) 

f)  Sexual abuse of a child by a person in a position of trust, authority, or 

supervision in the first degree (11 Del. C. § 778(1), (2), or (3)). 

As  with  any  discretionary  expungement  petition,  the  Court  has  the  discretion 
whether to grant the expungement.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
