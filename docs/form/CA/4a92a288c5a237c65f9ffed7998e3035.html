 IMPORTANT NOTICES
 The earliest you can be divorced is si
 x months and one day from one of these 
 three dates (whichever occurs first) : 
 (1) the date Respondent 
 was served with the 
 Summons
 (form FL 110) and 
 Petition (form FL 100) , (2) the date the 
 Response 
 (form FL 120) was filed, or (3) the date Appearance, Stipulations, and Waivers
 (form FL 130) was filed. Legal separation has no waiting period. You are NOT di
 vorced or legally separated until the court enters a Judgment
 inyour case. 
 If you need court orders for child support, custody, parentin
 g time (visitation) , spousal or partner support, restraining orders, or other issues, file a 
 Request for Order 
 (form FL 300) asking for temporary 
 orders. See ﬁRequest for Order Informationﬂ at courts. ca. gov/divorcerequests
 for more information. 
 STEP 1. Start Your Case
 The forms needed to start 
 your case and information ab
 out filing fees and fee wa
 ivers are available at ﬁFiling Your Case, ﬂ at 
 courts. ca. gov/filing
 . The petitioner
 (the person who files the first divorce or legal separation 
 forms with the court) fills out
 and files with the court 
 clerk at least a PetitionŠMarriage/Domestic Partnership 
 (form FL 100) and a 
 Summons 
 (form FL 110) and, if there are 
 children of the relationship, a 
 Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act
 (form FL 105) . 
 The court clerk will stamp and return
 copies of the filed forms to the 
 petitioner
 . The respondent has 30 days to file and serve a 
 Response. 
 So, the 
 petitioner
 must wait 30 days before starting Step 4. 
 Someone 18 or olderŒnot the 
 petitioner
 Œserves the spouse or domestic partner (called the 
 respondent) with all the forms from
 Step 1 plus a blank 
 ResponseŠMarriage/Domestic Partnership 
 (form FL 120) and files with th
 e court a proof-
 of service form, 
 such as Proof of Service of Summons
 (form FL 115) , telling when and how the respondent was served. (To 
 serve means ﬁto give
 in the proper legal way. ﬂ) For more information, see ﬁServing Your First Set of Court Formsﬂ at
 courts. ca. gov/filing
 . STEP 2. Serve the Forms Respondent files a 
 Response
 Respondent does not file a 
 Response 
 (called ﬁdefaultﬂ) 
 No Response 
 and NO 
 written agreement: 
 
 Petitioner waits 30 days after 
 
 Step 2 is complete and 
 
 prepares a proposed 
 Judgment
 (form FL 180) , together with 
 all other needed forms. See 
 ﬁTrue Default Caseﬂ at
 courts. ca. gov/truedefault. 
 No Response
 BUT written 
 agreement: 
 Petitioner attaches
 the signed and notarized 
 agreement to the proposed 
 
 Judgment 
 (form FL 180) , 
 together with all other needed forms. See ﬁDefault Case with 
 Written Agreementﬂ at courts. ca. gov/defaultagree. Response 
 AND written 
 agreement: 
 Either party files 
 Appearance, Stipulations, and 
 Waivers (form FL
 -130) and the 
 proposed 
 Judgment
 with 
 written agreement attached and other needed forms. See ﬁUncontested Caseﬂ at 
 courts. ca. gov/uncontested
 . Response 
 and NO 
 agreement: 
 Parties must go to trial to have a judge 
 resolve the issues. See 
 ﬁContested Caseﬂ at
 courts. ca. gov/contested. STEP 4. Finish the Divorce or Legal Separation Case in One of Four Ways
 You must keep the court and the other party informed of any change in 
 your mailing address or other contact 
 information. File and serve a 
 Notice of Change of Address or Other Contact Information 
 (form MC 040) on the other 
 party or his or her attorney to let them know
 about the change in your contact information. 
 At the same time as Step 1 or within 60 days of filing the 
 Petition
 , the petitioner must fill out and have these documents served 
 on the 
 respondent: Declaration of Disclosure 
 (form FL 140) , 
 Income and Expense Declaration 
 (form FL 150) , 
 Schedule of 
 Assets and Debts
 (form FL 142) or 
 Property Declaration
 (form FL 160) , and all tax returns filed by the party in the two years 
 before serving the disclosure documents. These di
 sclosure documents are not filed with the court. 
 If the 
 respondent files a 
 Response
 , he or she must also complete and serv
 e the same disclosure documents on the 
 petitioner within 60 days of filing the 
 Response
 . The 60 day time frame for serving the disclosures may be changed by written agreement between the parties or by court order. 
 The petitioner
 and respondent each file a 
 Declaration Regarding Service
 (form FL 141) with the court saying disclosures 
 were served. If the 
 respondent does not serve disclosures, the
 petitioner
 can still finish the case without them. For more 
 information, see ﬁFill Out and Serve Your Fi
 nancial Declaration of Disclosure Formsﬂ at courts. ca. gov/filing
 (click on Step 4) . 
 STEP 3. Disclose Financial Information 
 Annulments: See courts. ca. gov/annulment
 for information about annulments.

 Page 2 of 2
 Legal Steps for a Divorc
 e or Legal Separation You may prefer to resolve some or all 
 of the issues in your divorce or legal 
 separation case without having the court 
 decide for you. You and your spouse or do
 mestic partner can put your agreement in 
 writing and file it in your case. But 
 your agreement must follow all legal requirements. Getting help to resolve divorce or legal separation cases Do you have a registered domestic partnership? The process for a divorce or legal separation of a domestic partnership
 is the same as on page 1. For information about ending
 your domestic partnership in the superior court, see 
 courts. ca. 
 gov/filing
 . To find out if you are eligible to end your domes
 tic partnership through the Secretary of State, see 
 courts. ca. 
 gov/summdissodp
 . Note: There may be differences 
 in federal taxes and other issues 
 for domestic partnerships. Seek 
 advice from an attorney experienced in domestic partner law. 
 What if you want a legal separation? The process on page 1 is the same, except you will 
 NOT get a 
 Judgment
 for legal 
 separation unless both parties agre
 e to a legal separation OR if 
 respondent has not filed a Response
 . If both parties agree 
 to be legally separated but do not agree on other issues, the pa
 rties must go to trial to have a judge resolve those issues. 
 You are NOT legally separated until you receive a 
 Judgment
 signed by the court. For more information, see ﬁLegal 
 Separationﬂ at 
 courts. ca. gov/legalseparation. AFTER the court enters a judgment fo
 r legal separation, if you decide you 
 want a divorce, you must start a new case to request a divorce and pay another filing fee.

 d instructions. They can provide samples of agreements and other

 parties communicate to ex
 plore options and reach a

 parties must hire new lawyers. Settlement Conferences

 which a judge or an experi
 enced lawyer meets with 
 the parties and their lawyers to discuss the case and 
 their positions and suggests a resolution. The parties 
 
 can either agree to the suggestions or use the 
 
 suggestions to help in further settlement discussions.

 already have a family law case and have filed a 
 
 Request for Order

 sitation (parenting time) ,

 custody recommending counseling to try to help you 
 
 both make a parenting plan th
