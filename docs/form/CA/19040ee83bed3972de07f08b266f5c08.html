 Expedited Jury Trial Information Sheet

 Revised July 1, 2016, Mandatory Form

 Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3. 1545Œ3. 1553 
 This information sheet is for anyone involved in a civil 
 lawsuit who will be taking part in an expedited jury trialŠa trial that is shorter and has a smaller jury than a 
 traditional jury trial. 
 
 You can find the law and rules governing expedited 
 jury trials in Code of Civil Procedure sections 
 630. 01Œ630. 29 and in rules 3. 1545Œ3. 1553 of the 
 California Rules of Court. You can find these at any 
 county law library or online. The statutes are online 
 at http: //leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces/codes. xhtml. 
 The rules are at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/rules. 
 An expedited jury trial is a 
 short trial, generally lasting 
 only one or two days. It is intended to be quicker and 
 
 less expensive than a traditional jury trial. 
 As in a traditional jury trial, a jury will hear your case 
 and will reach a decision about whether one side has to 
 pay money to the other side. An expedited jury trial 
 differs from a regular jury trial in several important 
 
 ways: 
 The trial will be shorter. Each side has 5 hours to 
 pick a jury, put on all its witnesses, show the jury 
 
 its evidence, and argue its case. 
 The jury will be smaller. There will be 8 jurors 
 instead of 12. Choosing the jury will be faster. 
 The parties will exercise fewer challenges. 
 Mandatory expedited jury trials
 . All limited civil 
 casesŠcases where the demand for damages or the 
 
 value of property at issue is $25, 000 or lessŠcome 
 
 within the mandatory expedited jury trial
 procedures. These can be found in the Code of 
 Civil Procedure, starting at section 630. 20. Unless your case is an unlawful detainer (eviction) action, 
 
 or meets one of the exceptions set out in the statute, 
 
 it will be within the expedited jury trial procedures. 
 These exceptions are explained more in below. 
 Voluntary expedited jury trials. If your civil 
 case is not a limited civil case, or even if it is, 
 
 you can choose to take part in a 
 voluntary expedited jury trial, if all the parties agree to do so. Voluntary expedited jury trials have the same 
 
 shorter time frame and smaller jury that the 
 mandatory ones do, but have one other 
 important aspectŠ
 all parties must waive their 
 rights to appeal. 
 In order to help keep down the 
 costs of litigation, there are no appeals following 
 a voluntary expedited jury trial except in very 
 limited circumstances. These are explained more 
 
 fully in . . 
 The trial will take place at a courthouse and a judge, or, 
 if you agree, a temporary judge (a court commissioner or 
 
 an experienced attorney that the court appoints to act as 
 a judge) will handle the trial. 
 No. Just as in a traditional civil jury trial, only three-
 quarters of the jury must agree in order to reach a 
 
 decision in an expedited jury trial. With 8 people on the 
 jury, that means that at least 6 of the jurors must agree 
 on the verdict in an expedited jury trial. 
 Generally, yes, but not always. A verdict from a jury in 
 an expedited jury trial is like a verdict in a traditional 
 
 jury trial. The court will enter a judgment based on the 
 
 verdict, the jury™s decision that one or more defendants 
 
 will pay money to the plaintiff or that the plaintiff gets 
 
 no money at all. 
 But parties in an expedited jury trial, like in other kinds 
 of trials, are allowed to make an agreement before the 
 
 trial that guarantees that the defendant will pay a certain 
 
 amount to the plaintiff even if the jury decides on a 
 
 lower payment or no payment. That agreement may also 
 put a cap on the highest amount that a defendant has to 
 pay, even if the jury decides on a higher amount. These 
 
 agreements are known as ﬁhigh/low agreements. ﬂ You 
 
 should discuss with your attorney whether you should 
 
 enter into such an agreement in your case and how it will 
 affect you
 . The goal of the expedited jury trial process is to have 
 shorter and less expensive trials. The cases that come within the mandatory expedited 
 jury trial procedures are all limited civil actions, and 
 
 they must proceed under the limited discovery and

 unanimous decision? 1 Will the case be in front of a judge?

 EJT 001 INFO, 
 Page 2 of 2 
 EJT 001 INFO pretrial rules that apply to those actions. See Code of 
 Civil Procedure sections 90Œ100. 
 The voluntary expedited jury trial rules set up some 
 special procedures to help those cases have shorter 
 and less expensive trials. For example, the rules 
 require that several weeks before the trial takes 
 
 place, the parties show each other all exhibits and 
 
 tell each other what witnesses will be at the trial. In 
 
 addition, the judge will meet with the attorneys 
 before the trial to work out some things in advance. 
 The other big difference is that the parties in either kind 
 of expedited jury trial can 
 make agreements about how 
 the case will be tried so that it can be tried quickly and 
 
 effectively. These agreements
 may include what rules 
 will apply to the case, how many witnesses can testify 
 for each side, what kind of evidence may be used, and 
 what facts the parties already 
 agree to and so do not need 
 the jury to decide. The parties can agree to modify many 
 
 of the rules that apply to trials generally or to any 
 
 pretrial aspect of the expedited jury trials. 
 Not always. There are some exceptions. 
 The mandatory expedited jury trial procedures do 
 not apply to any unlawful detainer or eviction case. 
 Any party may ask to opt out of the procedures if the 
 case meets any of the criteria set out in Code of Civil 
 
 Procedure section 630. 20 (b) , all of which are also 
 
 described in item 2 of the 
 Request to Opt Out of Mandatory Expedited Jury Trial 
 (form EJT 003) . 
 Any request to opt out must be made on that form, 
 
 and it must be made within a certain time period, as 
 set out in Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3. 1546 (c) . Any 
 opposition must be filed within 15 days after the 
 
 request has been served. 
 The remainder of this information sheet applies only to 
 voluntary expedited jury trials. The process can be used in an
 y civil case that the parties 
 agree may be tried in one or two days. To have a 
 
 voluntary expedited jury trial, both sides must want one. 
 
 Each side must agree to all the 
 rules described in , 
 and to waive most appeal rights. The agreements 
 between the parties must be put into writing in a 
 document called 
 [Proposed] Consent Order for 
 Voluntary Expedited Jury Trial
 , which will be submitted 
 to the court for approval. (Form EJT 020 may be used 
 for this. ) The court must issue the consent order as 
 proposed by the parties unless the court finds good cause 
 why the action should not proceed through the expedited 
 
 jury trial process. 
 
 To keep costs down and provide a faster end to the case, 
 all parties who agree to take part in a voluntary 
 
 expedited jury trial must agree to waive the right to 
 
 appeal the jury verdict or decisions by the judicial officer 
 
 concerning the trial unless one of the following happens: Misconduct of the judicial officer that materially 
 affected substantial rights of a party; 
 Misconduct of the jury; or 
 Corruption or fraud or some other bad act 
 that prevented a fair trial. In addition, parties may not ask the judge to set the jury 
 verdict aside, except on those same grounds. Neither you 
 
 nor the other side will be able to ask for a new trial on 
 the grounds that the jury verdict was too high or too low, 
 that legal mistakes were made before or during the trial, 
 
 or that new evidence was found later. 
 No, unless the other side or the court agrees. Once you 
 
 and the other side have agreed to take part in a voluntary 
 
 expedited jury trial, that agreement is binding on both 
 
 sides. It can be changed only if 
 both sides want to 
 change it or stop the process or if a court decides there are good reasons the voluntary
 expedited jury trial 
 should not be used in the case. This is why it is 
 
 important to talk to your attorney 
 before agreeing to a voluntary expedited jury trial. This information sheet 
 
 does not cover everything you may need to know about 
 voluntary expedited jury trials. It only gives you an 
 overview of the process and how it may affect your 
 
 rights. You should discuss all the points covered here 
 and any questions you have about expedited jury 
 trials with an attorney before agreeing to a voluntary 
 expedited jury trial. Can I change my mind after agreeing 
 to a voluntary expedited jury trial? 
 10 Why do I give up most of my rights 
 to an appeal in a voluntary 
 expedited jury trial? 
 7 9 Do I have to have an expedited jury 
 trial if m
 y case is for $25, 000 or less?
