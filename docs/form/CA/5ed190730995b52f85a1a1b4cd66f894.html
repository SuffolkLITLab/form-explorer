      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields and Utilization:<sup>*</sup></h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
      </p>
      
      <p style="background:#fcf19d"><sup>*</sup><i> With historical form data we could provde insights on field utilization  
      (e.g., <b>X%</b> of the time this field is left blank...). 
       If you work with the court and can help provide historic form data, <a href="mailto:litlab@suffolk.edu">let us know</a>.
