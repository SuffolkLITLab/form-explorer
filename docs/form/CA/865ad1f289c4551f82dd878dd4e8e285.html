      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Instructions for Requesting a Hearing to Review Waiver of Presumptive Transfer of Specialty Mental Health Services Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov New September 1, 2018, Optional Form Welfare and Institutions Code, § 14717. 1 Instructions for Requesting a Hearing to Review Waiver of Presumptive Transfer of Specialty Mental Health Services JV 214 INFO, Page 1 of 2 JV 214 INFOWhat are the exceptions to the presumptive transfer of responsibility of 
 specialty mental health services? There are four exceptions to presumptive transfer: a. The transfer would disrupt the continuity of care or delay access to services for the child or nonminor. In other words, the services would be 
 interrupted or delayed in some way by the 
 presumptive transfer. b. The transfer would interfere with family reunification efforts documented in the individual 
 case plan. c. The placement in a county other than the home county is expected to last less than six months. d. The child™s or nonminor™s residence is within 30 minutes of travel time to his or her established 
 specialty mental health care provider in the home 
 county. What is presumptive transfer? Most foster children are eligible for specialty mental 
 health services, such as therapy to address emotional, 
 behavioral, and developmental problems. When a 
 child is removed from his or her parent™s or 
 guardian™s home, the county where the child lived 
 (the ﬁhome countyﬂ or ﬁcounty of original 
 jurisdictionﬂ) is responsible for arranging, paying for, 
 and providing these services. When a child or 
 nonminor is placed outside his or her home county, 
 the responsibility for providing these services must 
 transfer to the county where the child lives, unless 
 certain exceptions apply. This process is called 
 ﬁpresumptive transfer. ﬂ The purpose of presumptive 
 transfer is to ensure that foster children who are 
 placed outside of their home county receive access to 
 these services without delay, based on their 
 individual strengths and needs. How does the presumptive transfer process begin? When a decision is made to place the child or nonminor outside the home county, the social worker 
 or probation officer must inform certain individuals 
 of the presumptive transfer requirements and a Requesting a waiver of presumptive 
 transfer You may believe it would better if the child™s or 
 nonminor™s home county remained responsible for 
 his or her mental health services. Maybe you think so 
 because the child or nonminor would lose an 
 important relationship with a service provider, or 
 reunification efforts would be affected. The child or 
 nonminor, his or her attorney, and the person or 
 agency responsible for making mental health care 
 decisions on behalf of the child or nonminor can 
 request that the placing agency consider waiving 
 presumptive transfer based on an exception listed 
 in , keeping the responsibility for mental health 
 services in the home county. The placing agency must inform the person or agency who requested the waiver and any party to 
 the case of its decision on the request for waiver of 
 presumptive transfer. The person who requested the 
 waiver and any party to the case can ask the court to 
 review the placing agency™s decision. If you are entitled to request a waiver of presumptive transfer, the social worker or probation officer should 
 inform you how and when a request for waiver must 
 be made. Ł the child or nonminor, Ł the attorney for the child or nonminor, Ł and the person or agency responsible for making mental health care decisions on behalf of the child 
 or nonminor (the parent or guardian, unless the court has made an order appointing someone else) . The social worker or probation officer will decide whether there is an exception to presumptive transfer. 
 This decision must be communicated in writing or orally to the individual who requested waiver of presumptive transfer, along with all parties to the 
 case. How is a decision on a request for waiver made? 1345232 description of exceptions, the option to request a 
 waiver of presumptive transfer if an exception exists, 
 and the way to make such a request to the placing 
 agency. These individuals include: JV 214 INFO, Page 2 of 2 Instructions for Requesting a Hearing to Review Waiver of Presumptive Transfer of Specialty Mental Health Services New September 1, 2018 The person who requested the waiver or any other party to the case may request a court hearing to 
 review the placing agency™s decision on the waiver 
 request. To request a hearing, you must file a request 
 for hearing on form JV 214 with the clerk in the 
 superior court where the child™s or nonminor™s case 
 is being heard. This request must be filed within 
 seven court days of the social workers or probation 
 officers telling you of the decision on the request for 
 waiver. On form JV 214, you will need to explain to the court why it would be better for the child or 
 nonminor to have the home county maintain 
 responsibility for mental health treatment, or to have 
 that responsibility moved to the new county of 
 residence. The person requesting a hearing also must 
 inform the placing agency that they are requesting a 
 hearing. To do so, give a copy of form JV 214 to the 
 social worker or probation officer within seven days 
 of being informed of the placing agency™s decision 
 on the request for the waiver of presumptive transfer. How do I request a hearing? What happens before and during the hearing? The court will read the request for a hearing and 
 decide whether to grant a hearing based on the 
 information provided on form JV 214. If no hearing 
 is granted, the placing agency™s decision will become 
 final. If a hearing is granted, presumptive transfer 
 will be on hold until the court makes a ruling on the 
 request for a waiver. Services to the child or 
 nonminor will continue to be provided by the child's 
 or nonminor's home county until the court either 
 denies the request for a hearing, or makes a ruling at 
 the hearing that presumptive transfer should or 
 should not occur. If no hearing is granted, the placing 
 agency's determination on the request for waiver will 
 be final. 
 If a hearing is granted, the clerk of the court will 
 contact you by phone or letter informing you of the 
 hearing time, date, and location. At the hearing, the judge will want to know why presumptive transfer should or should not be waived. 
 The court will make its decision based on the best 
 interests of the child or nonminor. Be prepared to 6 explain to the judge why you believe it is in the 
 child™s or nonminor™s best interests to keep the 
 responsibility for mental health treatment in the 
 home county or to move it to the new county of 
 residence. 77 Instructions for Requesting a Hearing to Review Waiver of
