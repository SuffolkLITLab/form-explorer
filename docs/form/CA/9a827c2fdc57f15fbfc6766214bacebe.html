      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found:  (Continued on page 2) First, read the court's decisions on Form SC 200, 
 Notice of Entry of Judgment
 . It will tell you the court™s judgment in this 
 case. Then read this form. 
 It will help you protect or 
 enforce your rights, whether you won or lost the case. If the court ordered you to pay money– Pay the judgment creditor directly. 
 Ask the court to let you ma
 ke payments. (To do this, file Form SC 220, Request to Make Payments
 . ) SC 200 INFOWhat to Do After the Court Decides Your Small Claims Case 
 Warning! You may lose important rights if
 you do not act within 30 days a
 fter the court handed or mailed you Form SC 200, Notice of Entry of Judgment. If the court mailed the 
 Notice of Entry of Judgment, 
 the date of 
 mailing is on the 
 Clerk's Certificate of Mailing
 that came with the notice. 
 If the court did not award you any money on a claim that you filed– The court™s decision on your 
 claim is normally
 final. You cannot appeal the decision on your own claim, but you may be allowed to ask the court to 
 correct a mistake in the judgment. 
 Warning! 
 If you do not pay the judgment or file
 an
 appeal or a motion to vacate (cancel) or correct the 
 
 judgment 
 within 30 days
 after the 
 Notice of Entry of 
 Judgment was handed or mailed to you
 , your wages, 
 money, and property can be taken to pay the claim. 
 
 You may also have to pay inte
 rest. If your case involves 
 an auto accident on a California highway, the Depart- 
 ment of Motor Vehicles (DMV) can suspend your 
 
 driver's license. You are the 
 judgment debtor
 . The law requires you to 
 pay the judgment. You 
 can: 
 Pay the court. (To do this, file Form SC 145, 
 Request to Pay Judg
 ment to Court. ) 
 Or After you pay the judgment in full, 
 you can ask the 
 judgment creditor to file a form saying the judgment is 
 
 paid. (See Form SC 290, 
 Acknowledgment of Satis- 
 faction of Judgment
 . ) If the judgment creditor does not 
 do this, he or she may have to pay you damages and a 
 penalty. 
 If you disagree with the judgment ordering you to 
 pay money and you went to the small claims trial, 
 you can appeal that decision. (You cannot appeal the 
 
 decision on your own claim. ) To do this, file Form 
 SC 140, 
 Notice of Appeal
 , within 30 days after the 
 Notice of Entry of Judgment
 was handed or mailed to 
 you. There will be a new trial in
 the superior court on all 
 claims in the case. Each 
 side will present evidence 
 again. This time, each side can have a lawyer at the 
 
 trial. (Continued on page 2) If the court ordered the other side to pay 
 you– Important! The judgment debtor has 
 30 days
 after the 
 Notice of Entry of Judgment
 was handed or mailed to him 
 or her to appeal or pay or ask the court to cancel or correct 
 
 the judgment. You cannot take
 legal steps to collect the 
 judgment during this time. 
 You are the 
 judgment creditor
 . You must collect your 
 judgment. The court will not colle
 ct it for you. Some steps 
 you can take to collect your 
 money are summarized below. 
 For more information, go to 
 www. courtinfo. ca. gov/selfhelp 
 /smallclaims/collectintro. htm. 
 Ask the judgment debtor to pay you the money. 
 If the 
 judgment debtor cannot afford to pay the judgment all at 
 
 once, consider offering to ta
 ke payments. If your claim was 
 for possession of property, ask the judgment debtor to 
 
 return the prop
 erty to you. If the judgment debtor does not pay, you can find out 
 about the debtor's income or property
 that the sheriff 
 can take to satisfy the judgment. 
 If the debtor does not pay wi
 thin 30 days after the court 
 clerk delivered or mailed the 
 Notice of Entry of Judgment
 , the debtor must send you Form SC 133, 
 Judgment 
 Debtor's Statement of Assets
 . This form will tell you what 
 property the debtor has that may be used to pay the 
 
 judgment. 
 ŁIf the debtor does not send you the completed Form 
 SC 133, 
 you can file Form SC 134, 
 Application and Order 
 to Produce Statement of Assets and to Appear for 
 
 Examination. In this form, you can 
 also ask the court to 
 award you your attorney fees, expenses, and other 
 
 appropriate relief. 
 ŁŁŁŁIf the debtor 
 does
 send you Form SC 133, you can 
 still have the debtor come to court to answer 
 questions
 about income and property. To do this, 
 file Form EJ 125, Application and Order for Appearance and 
 
 Examination. ŁIf any payment is not made in full and on time, the 
 judgment creditor may notify the court to cancel the 
 
 payment plan and the enti
 re unpaid balance will 
 become due and collectible.
