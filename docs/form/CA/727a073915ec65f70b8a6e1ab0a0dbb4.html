      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: JV 290 INFOINSTRUCTION SHEET FOR CAREGIVER INFORMATION FORM Background What is the "Caregiver
 Information Form"? The 
 Caregiver Information Form
 , also called form JV
 -290, is intended 
 to provide an easily accessible way for foster parents, relative caregivers, preadoptive parents, nonrelative extended 
 family members, legal guardians, commun
 ity care facilities, and foster family 
 agencies (or any other individual or agency currently caring for a foster child) to provide information about the child to the court. 
 When does it need to 
 be filled out and filed? 
 The 
 Caregiver Information Form
 is an optional form. If you choose 
 to use it, fill it out and file it with th
 e court along with eight copies, at least five days before the hearing, or mail it to
 the court for filing at least seven days before the hearing. Follow the instructions below. Do not wait until the day of 
 the court hearing to
 file the form. 
 Current foster parents, relative caregivers, preadoptive parents, nonrelative extended family members, 
 legal guardians, and other individuals caring for a child: 
 You may fill out this form 
 even if a staff person from 
 the child's foster family agency or co
 mmunity care facility is also filling it 
 out. You may write a 
 letter to the court, instead of using the form. Either way, follow the procedures described on the next page about making copies, filing, 
 
 and attending the hear
 ing. Be aware that the form or
 letter will be provided to part
 ies and attorneys. If you are a 
 confidential foster parent, provide information to the child
 's social worker rather than filing the form or letter with the 
 court. 
 3. Complete the caption. 
 These are the boxes at the top of the page. 
 Court name, street addr
 ess, and mailing address. 
 Write the name of the county where the court is located and 
 the street and mailing addresses of the court. If you do not know the name and address of the court, look on the 
 
 notice of the court hearing you 
 received in the mail or go to www. courtinfo. ca. gov/courts/find. htm
 to find the local court in your county. For branch name, write "Juvenile. "
 Case Number. 
 This number is on the notice of the court hearing you received in the mail. If you do not have the 
 number, ask the child's social worker or attorney for the number. If the case involves brothers and sisters 
 (siblings) , there may be more than one case number. Be sure to use a separate form and the correct number 
 for each child. Page 1 of 2
