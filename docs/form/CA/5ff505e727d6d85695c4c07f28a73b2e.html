 RESPONDENT/DEFENDANT: INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER (EARNINGS ASSIGNMENT ORDER FOR SUPPORT) DEFINITIONS OF IMPORTANT WORDS IN THE ORDER
 1. (b) (a) Alternate payee: any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of the Participant. Participant/Obligor: any person ordered by a court to pay child support, spousal support, or family support who has an accrued benefit or account balance (whether or not vested) under a Plan. (c) Agent: any person, including the district attorney or 
 other governmental agency, to whom the support is to 
 be paid on behalf of an alternate payee. (d) Payor/Plan: any employee benefit plan described in Family Code section 80 that is not a governmental plan 
 as defined in 29 U. S. C. § 1002 (32) . The term includes 
 plans benefiting self employed individuals such as partners and sole proprietors. If an entity other than the Plan pays benefits to participants under the Plan, the 
 term Payor/Plan also includes that entity. (e) QDRO: an order that has been approved by the administrator of the Plan (or by a court of competent 
 jurisdiction) as meeting the requirements for a qualified domestic relations order under 29 U. S. C. § 1056 (d) or 26 U. S. C. § 414 (p) . (f) Annuity: a form of benefit in which periodic payments (usually monthly) are made for the life of the recipient 
 and/or the recipient's survivor. This order applies to annuities and to any other form of benefit payment or distribution allowable under the Plan (e. g. , single sum, 
 installments, and other periodic payments) . TAX INFORMATION FOR PAYORS 2. Generally speaking, for federal income tax purposes, the Participant will be taxed on any child support paid from a Plan based on this order. Amounts paid by the Plan for 
 spousal or family support generally will be taxable to the Alternate Payee for whose benefit those amounts are paid. You should consult with your professional tax advisor on the specific tax treatment and reporting requirements 
 applicable to distributions under this order. 2. TAX INFORMATION FOR PAYORS (continued) OTHER INFORMATION FOR PAYORS 3. This order, which is an earnings assignment order, and 
 you as the Payor are governed by Chapter 8, beginning with section 5200, of the Family Code and related provisions of that code and the Code of Civil Procedure. 
 Your attention is directed particularly to the provisions of 
 Chapter 8 that set forth your obligations as a Payor 
 (referred to therein as the "Employer") . When benefits under the Plan are currently payable to the Participant, withholding under this order should commence 
 as soon as possible but no later than 10 days after you 
 receive the Qualified Domestic Relations Order for Support. If benefits are not currently payable but Participant has applied to receive benefits, or applies within 90 days after you receive this order or while the temporary restraining order contained in item 13 of this order is in effect, this order (including the temporary restraining order) applies to the benefits Participant has applied for and becomes entitled to receive under the terms of the Plan. Once this order has been approved as a QDRO, all benefits withheld pursuant to the temporary restraining order must be disbursed in accordance with the terms of 
 this order or, to the extent those benefits are not affected by this order, to the person or persons entitled to them under the terms of the Plan. If you have any questions about this order, please contact the office that sent this form to you, as shown in the upper left hand corner. INFORMATION FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS: You should have received a Request for Hearing Regarding Earnings Assignment (form FL 450) with the Qualified Domestic Relations Order for Support. If not, you may get one from either the court clerk or the local child support agency. If you want the court to stop or modify the assignment of your benefits under the Plan, you must file (hand deliver or mail) an original copy of form FL 450 with the court clerk within 10 days of the date you received this order. Keep a copy of the form for your records. 4. If you think your support order is wrong, you can ask for a modification of the order, or in some cases you can have the order set aside and a new order issued. You can talk to any attorney or visit the family law facilitator if you need more help.
