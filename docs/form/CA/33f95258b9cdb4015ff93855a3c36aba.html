      <pre>FL-320-INFO   Information Sheet: Responsive Declaration to Request for Order

If you received a Request for Order (form FL-300), 
•
•

Carefully read the papers you received to make sure you understand what orders are being requested.
Note the date, time, and location of the court hearing.
Check to see if the court ordered a specific date for filing and serving your Responsive Declaration to Request 
for Order (form FL-320).
If you need more time before the hearing to prepare a responsive declaration or talk with a lawyer, you may ask 
the court to continue the hearing date. For more information, consult with a lawyer or contact the the Family Law 
Facilitator or Self-Help Center in your court (see item      ).

••

16

USE Responsive Declaration to Request for Order (form FL-320) 
Use form FL-320 to let the court and the other party know that you agree or disagree with each of the requests 
made in the Request for Order (form FL-300).

If you disagree, use form FL-320 to describe the orders you would like the court to make.

If you do not file and serve form FL-320, the court can still make orders without your input.

3

DO NOT USE Responsive Declaration to Request for Order (form FL-320) to: 

Ask for court orders that were not requested in the Request for Order (form FL-300). Instead, file and serve your 
own Request for Order (form FL-300) to ask for orders about other issues. 
Respond to Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form DV-100). Instead, you must use Response to 
Request for Domestic Restraining Order (form DV-120).

4

Forms checklist
a.

Form FL-320, Responsive Declaration to Request for Order is the basic form you need. Depending on the 
requests made in the Request for Order (form FL-300), you may need other forms.

b.

For child custody or visitation (parenting time) orders, you may need to complete some of these forms:

1

2

••

• •

FL-105, Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act
FL-311, Child Custody and Visitation (Parenting Time) Application Attachment
FL-312, Request for Child Abduction Prevention Orders
FL-341(C), Children’s Holiday Schedule Attachment
FL-341(D), Additional Provisions—Physical Custody Attachment
FL-341(E), Joint Legal Custody Attachment

A current form FL-150, Income and Expense Declaration. You may use form FL-155, Financial Statement    
(Simplified) instead of form FL-150 if you meet the requirements listed on page 2 of form FL-155.

Notice:    The court will order child support based on the income of the parents. 
                Child support normally continues until the child is 18 years and has graduated from high school.  
                You must give the court information about your finances. If you do not, the child support order  
                will be based on information about your income that the court receives from other sources.

•• •

d. 

For spousal or domestic partner support or orders about your finances, you need these forms:

FL-150, Income and Expense Declaration
FL-157, Spousal or Partner Support Declaration Attachment (if the request is to change a support judgment)

e.

For attorney’s fees and costs, you need these forms:

FL-150, Income and Expense Declaration 
FL-158, Supporting Declaration for Attorney’s Fees and Costs (or provide the information in a declaration)

 Information Sheet: Responsive Declaration to 
Request for Order 
(Family Law)

FL-320-INFO,  Page 1 of 3

FL-320-INFO   Information Sheet: Responsive Declaration to Request for Order

To respond to a Request for Order, you must: 
Complete caption of the form

5

6

Complete the top portion including your name, 
address, and telephone number, the court address, 
the name of all the parties in the case, and the case 
number. Also, print or type the same hearing date, 
time, and department that appears on the Request 
for Order (form FL-300).

Specify a response to orders requested
Items 1–9: Each item on the form matches the 
item numbers on the Request for Order (form 
FL-300). Complete item 1. Next, mark the same 
box that is marked on form FL-300. Then, specify 
if you consent (agree) or do not consent to 
(disagree with) the orders requested. If you 
disagree, describe the order you would like the 
court to make. Note: you may file one form  
FL-150 to respond to items 3, 4, and 6.

Item 10: Use the space to explain your responses 
to items 1–9. Include the reasons why you do not 
agree with the orders requested by the other party 
and why the court should make the orders you 
described. If you need more space, write your 
responses on a separate sheet of paper and attach it 
to the form (Attached Declaration (form MC-031) 
may be used for this purpose).
Sign and date: Print your name, sign, and write 
the date you signed form FL-320. 

7

Next steps: file or serve your paperwork
You must file your paperwork with the court clerk 
at least 9 court days before the hearing. If the court 
orders a shorter time to file your papers, file them 
by the date specified in the order.  

Make 2 copies of your original paperwork. Then, 
do one of the following before the filing deadline:

•

•

Take your paperwork and copies to the court 
clerk to process (or e-file them, if available in 
your county). The clerk will keep the original and 
give you back copies with a court stamp on them. 
Have a stamped copy served; or 

Have an unstamped copy of your paperwork 
served before you take (or e-file) the  
originals and copies to the court clerk to file. 
Be sure the original documents are not served.

8

9

Pay filing fees
Generally, you do not have to pay a fee to file the  
Responsive Declaration. However, if you have 
never filed any papers in the case, you may have to 
pay a “first appearance fee,” which, in general, 
everyone has to pay when filing court papers in a 
case for the first time. 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can 
ask the court to waive the fees. To do so, complete 
and file form FW-001, Request to Waive Court 
Fees and form FW-003, Order on Court Fee 
Waiver. 

Serve your papers on the other party
“Service” is the act of giving your legal papers to 
all persons named as parties in the case so that they 
know what orders you want the court to make. 
Note: If a party has a lawyer in the  
case, the papers should be served on that party’s  
lawyer.

How to “serve”
Server. You cannot serve the papers. Have 
someone else (who is at least 18 years old) do it. 
The “server” can be a friend, a relative who is not 
involved in your case, a county sheriff, or a 
professional process server.

Personal service.  
Your papers may be  
served by “personal 
service.” “Personal 
service” means that  
your “server” walks up to each person to be served, 
makes sure he or she is the right person, and then 
gives a copy of all the papers to him or her.

Service by mail. 
“Service by mail” 
means that your 
“server” places copies 
of all the documents 
in a sealed envelope 
and mails them to the  
address of each party
being served (or to the party’s lawyer, if he or she 
has one.) The server must be 18 years of age or over 
and must live or work in the county where the  
mailing took place.

Deadline for service
Personal service or service by mail on the other 
party must be completed at least 9 court days before 
the court hearing. If the court has ordered a shorter 
time to serve your responsive papers, be sure to 
have them served by the date specified in the court 
order.

Server must complete a Proof of Service
After personal service, the server should complete a 
form FL-330, Proof of Personal Service. Form 
FL-330-INFO, Information Sheet for Proof of 
Personal Service has instructions to help the person 
complete the form. 

After service by mail, the server should complete 
form FL-335, Proof of Service by Mail. Form 
FL-335-INFO, Information Sheet for Proof of 
Service by Mail has instructions to help the person 
complete the form. 

11

12

13

14

File the Proof of Service before your 
hearing date
The Proof of Service shows the judge that the 
person received a copy of your Responsive 
Declaration to Request for Order. Make three 
copies of the completed Proof of Service. Take the 
original and copies to the court clerk as soon as 
possible before your hearing. 

The clerk will keep the original and give you back 
the copies stamped “Filed.” Bring a copy stamped 
“Filed” to your hearing. (If unstamped copies of 
your paperwork were served, you can file the 
completed Proof of Service when you file the 
original Responsive Declaration.)

Participate in child custody mediation or 
child custody recommending counseling
If the Request for Order includes a court order for 
you to attend mediation or child custody 
recommending counseling, the date, time, and 
location is found on page 1 of the Request for 
Order. For more information, read Child Custody 
Information Sheet (form FL-313-INFO or form 
FL-314-INFO).

15

Get ready for your hearing

Take at least two copies of your documents and 
filed forms to the hearing. Include a filed Proof of 
Service form.

hearing at www.courts.ca.gov/1094.htm.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
