A writ of execution is a court paper that tells a law officer to take property of the judgment debtor to

 property the officer may be able to take: wages, bank 
 account, automobile, business property, or rental 
 income. For some kinds of property, you may need to file 
 other forms. See the law officer for information. Your small claims case has been decided. The judgment or decision of the court appears on the front of this sheet. The court may have ordered one party to pay money to the other party. The person (or business) who won the case and who can collect the money is called the judgment creditor. The person (or business) who lost the case and who owes the money is called the judgment debtor. Enforcement of the judgment is postponed until the time for appeal ends or until the appeal is decided. This means that the judgment 
 creditor cannot collect any money or take any action until this period is over. Generally, both parties may be represented by lawyers 
 after judgment. 1. If you lost the case on your own claim and the court did not award you any money, the court's decision on your claim is 
 FINAL. You may not appeal your own claim. 2 . If you did not go to the trial, you may ask the court to vacate 
 or cancel the judgment. To make this request, you must file a Motion to Vacate the Judgment (form SC 135) and pay the required fee within 30 days after the date this Notice of Entry of Judgment was mailed. If your request is denied, you then have 10 days from the date the notice of denial was mailed to file an appeal. The period to file the Motion to Vacate the Judgment is 180 days if you were not properly served with the claim. The 180 day period begins on the date you found out or should have found out about the judgment against you. If you won the case and the court awarded you money, here 
 are some steps you may take to collect your money or get 
 possession of your property: Sometimes fees are charged for filing court papers or for 
 serving the judgment debtor. These extra costs can 
 become part of your original judgment. To claim these fees, ask the clerk for a Memorandum of Costs. The law requires you to pay the amount of the judgment. You may pay the judgment creditor directly, or pay the 
 judgment to the court for an additional fee. You may also 
 ask the court to order monthly payments you can afford. 
 Ask the clerk for information about these procedures. a. COLLECTING FEES AND INTERESTSC 130 SMALL CLAIMS CASE NO. : judgment creditorassignee of record. Date: (TYPE OR PRINT NAME) 1. </div>
