Sec. 1. Instructions to All Parties

(a)   Interrogatories  are  written questions prepared by a party to
an  action  that are sent to any other party in the action to be 
answered under oath.  The  interrogatories  below  are  form 
interrogatories approved for use in economic litigation.
(b)  For  time  limitations,   requirements   for   service   on   other
parties,  and  other  details,  see  Code   of   Civil  Procedure
sections 2030.010–2030.410 and the cases construing those
sections.

(c)  These  form   interrogatories   do   not   change  existing  law
relating  to  interrogatories,  nor  do they affect an answering 
party's right to assert any privilege or make any objection.

Sec. 2. Instructions to the Asking Party
(a)  These  interrogatories   are   designed   for  optional  use  by
parties  under  economic  litigation in limited civil cases. See 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 90 through 100.  However, 
these  interrogatories  also  may  be  used  in  unlimited  civil
cases.

(b)  There  are  restrictions  on  discovery   for  most  limited  civil
cases. These restrictions limit the number of interrogatories 
that may be asked. For details, read Code of Civil 
Procedure section 94.

(c)   Some of these interrogatories are similar to questions in the

Case Questionnaire for Limited Civil Cases (form DISC-010) 
and may be omitted if the  information  sought   has   already  
been  provided  in  a completed Case Questionnaire.

(d)   Check  the  box next to each interrogatory that you want the
answering  party  to  answer.  Use  care  in  choosing  those 
interrogatories  that  apply  to  the  case  and  are  within the 
restrictions discussed above.

(e)   You may insert your own definition of  INCIDENT  in Section
4,  but only where the action arises from a course of conduct 
or a series of events occurring over a period of time.

(f)   The interrogatories  in  section  116.0,  Defendant's  Conten-
tions - Personal  Injury,  should  not  be used until defendant 
has    had    a    reasonable    opportunity    to    conduct   an 
investigation or discovery of plaintiff's injuries and damages.
(g)   Additional  interrogatories  may  be attached,  subject  to the
       restrictions discussed above.
Sec. 3. Instructions to the Answering Party
(a)   Subject   to   the   restrictions   discussed  above,  you  must
answer  or  provide  another  appropriate  response  to each 
interrogatory that has been checked below.

(b)   As a general  rule,  within  30 days after you are served with
these interrogatories, you must serve your responses on the 
asking party and serve copies of your responses on all other 
parties who have appeared.  See  Code  of  Civil  Procedure
sections 2030.260–2030.270 for details.

(c)   Each  answer  must  be as complete and straight-forward as
the  information  reasonably  available  to  you  permits. If an 
interrogatory cannot be answered  completely,  answer  it  to 
the extent possible.

(d)   If  you  do  not  have  enough  personal   knowledge  to  fully
answer an interrogatory, say so, but make a reasonable and 
good  faith  effort   to   get  the  information  by  asking  other 
persons  or  organizations,  unless the information is equally
available to the asking party.

(e)   Whenever an interrogatory may be answered by referring to
a document, the document may be attached as an exhibit to 
the   response   and   referred   to   in  the  response.   If  the 
document has more than one page,  refer  to  the  page  and
section where the answer to the interrogatory can be found.
(f)    Whenever  an  address and telephone number for the same
person  are  requested  in  more  than one interrogatory, you 
are   required  to  furnish  them  in  answering  only  the  first 
interrogatory asking for that information.

(g)   Your   answers  to  these  interrogatories  must  be  verified,
dated, and signed.  You  may wish to use the following form
at the end of your answers:

       I  declare  under  penalty  of  perjury  under  the laws of the 
State  of  California   that  the  foregoing  answers  are  true  and 
correct.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
