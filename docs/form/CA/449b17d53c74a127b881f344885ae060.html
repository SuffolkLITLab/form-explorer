Privacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old)  
Civil Harassment Prevention

Can I keep information about a 
minor confidential? 

Yes. In a civil harassment restraining order case, you can 
ask a judge to make information about a minor 
confidential. Confidential means that the public is 
unable to see the information, because the information  
is kept private. This is important because most papers  
in your court case are available for the public to see.  
This means anyone can view information on your 
papers, including information about a minor. If the  
judge grants your request, the public will not be able to 
see the minor's information on your paperwork. 

Who can make this request? 
Several people can make this request,  
including a minor's parent or legal guardian.  
Any minor protected by a restraining order can make 
this request, as well. Also, any person, including a 
minor, who is the accused person in a case may make 
this request. 

A minor can make this request without the help of an 
adult. This depends on the minor's age, though. If the 
minor is 12 years old or younger, the judge may want 
an adult to help the minor make this request.  

For more information on who can make this request, 
contact your local self-help center or a lawyer. 

What information can I ask the judge  
to make confidential? 
A judge can make any information about a minor 
confidential. That means that you can ask to make 
confidential the minor's name, address, and any 
statements about what the minor experienced or 
witnessed.  

If you want to protect the minor's address only, you do 
not have to make this request. Instead, you can use a 
different address on your restraining order request,  
such as a mailing address that is not where the minor 
lives, a P.O. box, or someone else's address. If you use 
someone else's address, be sure to get their permission 
first. 

Whatever address you use, make sure you will get your 
mail regularly. This is important, because the address 
you use is the address the court and other party will use 
to send you papers for your case. 

Does this request cost money? 
That depends on the type of harassment. If the person 
you want to restrain used or threatened to use violence 
against you or stalked you, you do not have to pay a 
filing fee. Otherwise, you must pay a filing fee. 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the court 
clerk how to apply for a fee waiver. You will need to fill 
out form FW-001. 

If the protective order is based on prior acts of violence, 
a credible threat of violence, or stalking, the sheriff or 
marshal must serve your order for free. Also, if you are 
eligible for a fee waiver, you can ask the sheriff or 
marshal to serve the order for free. If you are not eligible 
for free service, you must pay the sheriff or marshal to 
serve the order. 

I need an interpreter. How can I get help? 

You may use form INT-300 to request an 
interpreter. Ask court staff for information. 

I have a disability. How can I get help? 
You may use form MC-410 to request assistance.
Contact the disability/ADA coordinator at your local 
court for more information. 

Do I need a lawyer to make this request? 
No, but this type of request can be hard to get through 
on your own. Free help may be available at your local 
court's self-help center. (See below.) 

Where can I find a self-help center? 
Find your local court's self-help center at www.courts.
ca.gov/selfhelp. Self-help center staff will not act as 
your lawyer but may be able to give you information to 
help you decide what to do in your case.

What do I have to do to make information 
about a minor confidential? 
  

Step 1: Complete the forms.  

You will need to complete these 
forms to make your request: 

You can use 
these steps as 
a checklist.

     Form CH-160 

     Form CH-165 (complete items 1 and 2 only) 

You can find these forms online at www.courts.ca.
gov/forms. 
▶ See tips to complete the forms. 

To request a restraining order, you need to complete 
different forms. See form CH-100-INFO for a list  
of forms you need to complete to request a 
restraining order. 
  

q
Step 2: Take the forms to your court clerk to file. 

Find out which courthouse to take your forms to by 
calling your local court or searching online at 
www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm.

q

q

Step 3: Understand the judge's order.   

The judge will write your orders on form CH-165.  
The judge will grant or deny your request. 
▶ See page 3 for what this means.

Step 4: Give court papers to other parties. 
In some cases, you will need to have your server  
give court papers to the other parties in your  
case. This process is called service. 
▶ See page 4 for tips to complete service.

uTips for Step 1: Complete the forms. 
I only want to protect the minor's address. If you  
only want to protect the minor's address, you do not  
have to make this request. See "What information can  
I ask the judge to make confidential?" on page 1 for 
more information. 

I want to protect more than one minor. Only an adult  
who is the minors' parent or legal guardian may make a  
request to protect more than one minor's information. 
  
I want to give the minor's school or others copies of 
court orders from this case. If the court grants your 
request to make information regarding a minor 
confidential, you may want to ask the court for 
permission to give other people copies of certain 
documents in your case. You can make this request at 
item 9 on form CH-160.  
  
My right to cancel my restraining order request:  
You have the right to cancel your request for a 
restraining order if the judge does not grant your request 
to make information confidential. This right only applies 
if you are asking for a restraining order at the same time 
as your request to make information confidential. To 
cancel your request for a restraining order, check the 
box on form CH-160, item 7a, and item 8d(1), if it 
applies. 
  
                   

If you cancel your restraining order request, 
you will not receive a civil harassment 
restraining order at this time. 

  

  

If, after canceling your request for a restraining order, 
you want to ask for a restraining order based on the 
same facts, you must start the process over. See         
form CH-100-INFO for more information.

uTips for Step 3: 
   Understand the judge's order. 
Look at form CH-165 to see what the judge decided. 

 

  

    What if the judge granted my request? 

    Look closely at form CH-165, items 7 and 8, 

 
                 to see what information the judge made 
confidential in your case. If the judge granted your 
request to keep information confidential, the information 
the judge decided to keep confidential will not be 
available to the public. The information will be available 
only to the parties in the case.  

At times, the judge may make information confidential 
from the other party in your case. If this happens, the 
judge will complete item 8 on form CH-165. 

Now, take a close look at item 10 on form CH-165. 
This tells you who is responsible for redacting the 
information on your paperwork and the deadline for 
filing it with the court.  

Redacting means to hide (blacken or whiten out) 
information so it cannot be seen. If the judge 
makes you responsible for redacting the information, 
your local self-help center may be able to help you.

q

w What if I file documents with the court  

in the future? 

If you file documents with the court in the 
future, be sure to use form CH-175 as a cover 
sheet and follow the instructions at the top of 
the form.

            What if the judge did not grant 
 

    (denied) my request? 

 

    This means that if you move forward  

 
with your case, the minor's information will not be 
confidential. This is important because anyone can go to 
your local courthouse and 
ask to see the documents you filed in this case.  

If the judge does not grant your request, you may have 
other legal options available to you. Visit your local 
court's self-help center or talk with a lawyer.

w What if I asked to cancel my restraining  

order request? 

If you checked box 7a or 8d(1) on form CH-160 and 
the judge denied your request, the paperwork you 
turned in with this request will not be available to 
the public, except for page 1 of form CH-165. This 
includes form CH-100 and any proposed  
order forms. The court will either return these  
forms to you, destroy them, or delete them from its 
records unless you give the court permission  
to file the forms.

q

q

Is there a penalty for disclosing confidential 
information? 
Misusing or giving out confidential information can result 
in the court ordering you to pay up to $1,000 or other 
court penalties. You will not be penalized if you: 
 

•  Give information to police to help them enforce 

the judge's orders; or 

 

•  If you are the minor who has claimed harassment, 

violence, or threats of violence.

uTips for Step 4: Give court papers 
   to all parties in your case. 
In some cases, the judge will order you to  
serve your court papers. Look at form CH-165  
to see what the judge decided.

What did the judge decide in your case?

q

The judge denied (did not grant) my request to    
keep some information confidential. I canceled my 
request for a restraining order and there is no other 
issue in this case for a judge to decide on.

Your papers do not need to be served.  
You may stop here.

Step 1: Find out which papers you need to serve. 

The judge will check which papers you need to serve to 
the other parties in your case on form CH-165, item 13. 

Step 2: Find out whether you need to serve the  
other parties personally or by mail. 

The judge will check how you need to serve your  
court papers to the other parties in your case on  
form CH-165, item 13. 

If the judge checks item 13a, you will need to have your 
server personally serve (give) your court papers  
to the other parties in your case. 

If the judge checks item 13b, you will need to have your 
server mail your court papers. 

Step 3: Choose a server. 

The person who serves your papers is called a server.
Your server must be at least 18 years old, not protected 
by the restraining order, and not involved in your case. 
You are not allowed to serve your own court papers. 

Some situations may be dangerous. Think  
about people's safety when deciding who you 
choose to serve your court papers. 
 

Rev. September 1, 2020

The judge granted my request to keep some of the 
minor's information confidential.

p

Your papers must be served. 
Follow steps 1–5 below.

u

The judge denied (did not grant) my request to keep 
some information confidential. I did not cancel my 
request for a restraining order.  The case is still open.

If this is your situation, forms CH-160 and 
CH-165 must be served by mail or in 
person.  
Follow steps 3–5 below.

A sheriff or marshal will serve your court papers for 
free. Another option is a process server.  

A process server is a business you pay to deliver court 
papers. To hire a process server, look for "process 
server" on the internet or in the yellow pages. 

Step 4: Have your server give your court papers  
to all parties 

For personal service, give your server your court papers 
as well as form CH-200. 

For service by mail, give your server your court papers 
as well as form PS-030. 

Step 5: File proof with the court. 

The court needs proof that your papers were served. 
After your server completes form CH-200 or form 
POS-030, take it to the court to file in your case.  

If the sheriff or marshal served your papers, they may 
use another form for proof instead of form CH-200. 
Make sure a copy is filed with the court and that  
you get a copy. 

For more information, read form CH-200-INFO or  
ask your local court's self-help center for help.
