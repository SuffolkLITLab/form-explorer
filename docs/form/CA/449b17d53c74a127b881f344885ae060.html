      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Privacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 160 INFOPrivacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) Civil Harassment Prevention Whatever address you use, make sure you will get your mail regularly. This is important, because the address you use is the address the court and other party will use to send you papers for your case. Does this request cost money? That depends on the type of harassment. If the person 
 you want to restrain used or threatened to use violence against you or stalked you, you do not have to pay a filing fee. Otherwise, you must pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the court clerk how to apply for a fee waiver. You will need to fill out form FW 001. If the protective order is based on prior acts of violence, a credible threat of violence, or stalking, the sheriff or marshal must serve your order for free. Also, if you are eligible for a fee waiver, you can ask the sheriff or 
 marshal to serve the order for free. If you are not eligible for free service, you must pay the sheriff or marshal to serve the order. I need an interpreter. How can I get help? You may use form INT 300 to request an interpreter. Ask court staff for information. I have a disability. How can I get help? You may use form MC 410 to request assistance. Contact the disability/ADA coordinator at your local court for more information. Do I need a lawyer to make this request? No, but this type of request can be hard to get through on your own. Free help may be available at your local court's self help center. (See below. ) Where can I find a self help center? Find your local court's self help center at www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp. Self help center staff will not act as your lawyer but may be able to give you information to help you decide what to do in your case. Can I keep information about a minor confidential? Yes. In a civil harassment restraining order case, you can ask a judge to make information about a minor confidential. Confidential means that the public is unable to see the information, because the information 
 is kept private. This is important because most papers in your court case are available for the public to see. This means anyone can view information on your papers, including information about a minor. If the judge grants your request, the public will not be able to 
 see the minor's information on your paperwork. Who can make this request? Several people can make this request, 
 including a minor's parent or legal guardian. Any minor protected by a restraining order can make this request, as well. Also, any person, including a 
 minor, who is the accused person in a case may make this request. A minor can make this request without the help of an adult. This depends on the minor's age, though. If the 
 minor is 12 years old or younger, the judge may want an adult to help the minor make this request. For more information on who can make this request, contact your local self help center or a lawyer. What information can I ask the judge to make confidential? A judge can make any information about a minor confidential. That means that you can ask to make confidential the minor's name, address, and any statements about what the minor experienced or 
 witnessed. If you want to protect the minor's address only, you do not have to make this request. Instead, you can use a different address on your restraining order request, 
 such as a mailing address that is not where the minor lives, a P. O. box, or someone else's address. If you use someone else's address, be sure to get their permission first. CH 160 INFO, Page 1 of 4 Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov Rev. September 1, 2020, Optional Form Code of Civil Procedure, ยง 527. 6 (v) Privacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 160 INFOPrivacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) Civil Harassment Prevention What do I have to do to make information about a minor confidential? Step 1: Complete the forms. You will need to complete these forms to make your request: Form CH 160 Form CH 165 (complete items 1 and 2 only) You can find these forms online at www. courts. ca. gov/forms. See tips to complete the forms. To request a restraining order, you need to complete different forms. See form CH 100 INFO for a list of forms you need to complete to request a restraining order. Step 2: Take the forms to your court clerk to file. Find out which courthouse to take your forms to by calling your local court or searching online at www. courts. ca. gov/find my court. htm. u Tips for Step 1: Complete the forms. I only want to protect the minor's address. If you only want to protect the minor's address, you do not have to make this request. See "What information can I ask the judge to make confidential? " on page 1 for 
 more information. I want to protect more than one minor. Only an adult who is the minors' parent or legal guardian may make a 
 request to protect more than one minor's information. I want to give the minor's school or others copies of court orders from this case. If the court grants your request to make information regarding a minor 
 confidential, you may want to ask the court for permission to give other people copies of certain documents in your case. You can make this request at item 9 on form CH 160. My right to cancel my restraining order request: 
 You have the right to cancel your request for a restraining order if the judge does not grant your request to make information confidential. This right only applies if you are asking for a restraining order at the same time as your request to make information confidential. To cancel your request for a restraining order, check the box on form CH 160, item 7 a, and item 8 d (1) , if it applies. 
 
 If, after canceling your request for a restraining order, you want to ask for a restraining order based on the same facts, you must start the process over. See form CH 100 INFO for more information. Step 3: Understand the judge's order. The judge will write your orders on form CH 165. The judge will grant or deny your request. See page 3 for what this means. CH 160 INFO, Page 2 of 4 You can use these steps as a checklist. Step 4: Give court papers to other parties. In some cases, you will need to have your server give court papers to the other parties in your 
 case. This process is called service. See page 4 for tips to complete service. qqq Where can I find other help? For safety tips or other help, call or visit the following hotlines online: National Human Trafficking Hotline, 1 888 373 788; TTY: 711; www. humantraffickinghotline. org National Sexual Assault Hotline, 1 800 656 4673, www. rainn. org Stalking Hotline, 1 855 484 2846, www. victimconnect. org/statistics/stalking/Rev. September 1, 2020 If you cancel your restraining order request, you will not receive a civil harassment restraining order at this time. Privacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 160 INFOPrivacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) Civil Harassment Prevention CH 160 INFO, Page 3 of 4 w What if I asked to cancel my restraining order request? If you checked box 7 a or 8 d (1) on form CH 160 and the judge denied your request, the paperwork you turned in with this request will not be available to the public, except for page 1 of form CH 165. This includes form CH 100 and any proposed order forms. The court will either return these forms to you, destroy them, or delete them from its records unless you give the court permission 
 to file the forms. qqqu Tips for Step 3: Understand the judge's order. Look at form CH 165 to see what the judge decided. What if the judge granted my request? Look closely at form CH 165, items 7 and 8, to see what information the judge made confidential in your case. If the judge granted your request to keep information confidential, the information 
 the judge decided to keep confidential will not be available to the public. The information will be available only to the parties in the case. At times, the judge may make information confidential from the other party in your case. If this happens, the 
 judge will complete item 8 on form CH 165. Now, take a close look at item 10 on form CH 165. This tells you who is responsible for redacting the information on your paperwork and the deadline for filing it with the court. Redacting means to hide (blacken or whiten out) information so it cannot be seen. If the judge makes you responsible for redacting the information, your local self help center may be able to help you. Rev. September 1, 2020 What if the judge did not grant 
 (denied) my request? This means that if you move forward with your case, the minor's information will not be confidential. This is important because anyone can go to your local courthouse and 
 ask to see the documents you filed in this case. If the judge does not grant your request, you may have other legal options available to you. Visit your local 
 court's self help center or talk with a lawyer. Is there a penalty for disclosing confidential 
 information? Misusing or giving out confidential information can result in the court ordering you to pay up to $1, 000 or other 
 court penalties. You will not be penalized if you: ยท Give information to police to help them enforce the judge's orders; or ยท If you are the minor who has claimed harassment, 
 violence, or threats of violence. w What if I file documents with the court in the future? If you file documents with the court in the future, be sure to use form CH 175 as a cover sheet and follow the instructions at the top of the form. Privacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 160 INFOPrivacy Protection for a Minor (Person Under 18 Years Old) Civil Harassment Prevention What did the judge decide in your case? Step 1: Find out which papers you need to serve. The judge will check which papers you need to serve to the other parties in your case on form CH 165, item 13. Step 2: Find out whether you need to serve the other parties personally or by mail. The judge will check how you need to serve your 
 court papers to the other parties in your case on form CH 165, item 13. If the judge checks item 13 a, you will need to have your server personally serve (give) your court papers to the other parties in your case. If the judge checks item 13 b, you will need to have your server mail your court papers. Step 3: Choose a server. The person who serves your papers is called a server. 
 Your server must be at least 18 years old, not protected 
 by the restraining order, and not involved in your case. You are not allowed to serve your own court papers. Some situations may be dangerous. Think about people's safety when deciding who you choose to serve your court papers. A sheriff or marshal will serve your court papers for 
 free. Another option is a process server. A process server is a business you pay to deliver court papers. To hire a process server, look for "process server" on the internet or in the yellow pages. Step 4: Have your server give your court papers to all parties For personal service, give your server your court papers 
 as well as form CH 200. For service by mail, give your server your court papers as well as form PS 030. Step 5: File proof with the court. The court needs proof that your papers were served. 
 After your server completes form CH 200 or form POS 030, take it to the court to file in your case. If the sheriff or marshal served your papers, they may 
 use another form for proof instead of form CH 200. Make sure a copy is filed with the court and that you get a copy. For more information, read form CH 200 INFO or ask your local court's self help center for help. u Tips for Step 4: Give court papers to all parties in your case. In some cases, the judge will order you to serve your court papers. Look at form CH 165 to see what the judge decided. CH 160 INFO, Page 4 of 4 The judge granted my request to keep some of the minor's information confidential. The judge denied (did not grant) my request to keep some information confidential. I did not cancel my request for a restraining order. The case is still open. The judge denied (did not grant) my request to keep some information confidential. I canceled my request for a restraining order and there is no other issue in this case for a judge to decide on. Your papers do not need to be served. You may stop here. Your papers must be served. Follow steps 1ล5 below. qup If this is your situation, forms CH 160 and CH 165 must be served by mail or in person. Follow steps 3ล5 below. Rev. September 1, 2020</div>
