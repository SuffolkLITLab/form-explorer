      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Judicial Council of California, Rev. January 1, 2021, Optional Form 
 Government Code, §§ 68630Œ68640 
 Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3. 51, 7. 5 www. courts. ca. gov INFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF SUPERIOR COURT FEES AND COSTS FW 001 INFO, Page 1 of 2 FW 001 INFOINFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF SUPERIOR COURT FEES AND COSTS If you have been sued or if you wish to sue someone, if you are filing or have received a family law petition, or if you 
 are asking the court to appoint a guardian for a minor or a conservator for an adult or are an appointed guardian or 
 conservator, and if you (or your ward or conservatee) cannot afford to pay court fees and costs, you may not have to pay 
 them in order to go to court. If you (or your ward or conservatee) are getting public benefits, are a low income person, 
 or do not have enough income to pay for your (or his or her) household™s basic needs and your court fees, you may ask 
 the court to waive all or part of those fees. 1. To make a request to the court to waive your fees in superior court, complete the Request to Waive Court Fees (form 
 FW 001) or, if you are petitioning for the appointment of a guardian or conservator or are an appointed guardian or 
 conservator, complete the Request to Waive Court Fees (Ward or Conservatee) (form FW 001 GC) . If you qualify, 
 the court will waive all or part of its fees for the following: Ł Filing papers in superior court (other than for an appeal in a case with a value of over $25, 000) Ł Ł Sheriff™s fee to give noticeŁ Court fee for telephone hearingŁ Reporter™s fee for attendance at hearing or trial, if the court is not electronically recording the proceeding 
 and you request that the court provide an official reporter (use form FW 020 to ask for a court reporter) Ł Preparing, certifying, copying, and sending the clerk™s transcript on appealŁ Holding in trust the deposit for a reporter™s transcript on appeal under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8. 833 or 8. 834Ł Making a transcript or copy of an official electronic recording under Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8. 835Ł Ł Sending papers to another court department 2. You may ask the court to waive other court fees during your case in superior court as well. To do that, complete a 
 Request to Waive Additional Court Fees (Superior Court) (form FW 002) or Request to Waive Additional Court Fees (Superior Court) (Ward or Conservatee) (form FW 002 GC) . The court will consider waiving fees for items such as the following, or other court services you need for your case: Ł Ł Fees for court appointed expertsŁ Other necessary court feesŁ Ł Court appointed interpreter fees for a witness 3. If you want the Appellate Division of the Superior Court or the Court of Appeal to review an order or judgment 
 against you and you want the court fees waived, ask for and follow the instructions on Information Sheet on Waiver of Appellate Court Fees (Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, Appellate Division) (form APP 015/FW 015 INFO) . Ł You are signing your request under penalty of perjury. Answer truthfully, accurately, and completely. Ł The court may ask you for information and evidence. You may be ordered to go to court to answer questions about 
 your ability, or the ability of your ward or conservatee, to pay court fees and costs and to provide proof of eligibility. 
 Any initial fee waiver you or your ward or conservatee are granted may be ended if you do not go to court when asked. 
 You or your ward™s or conservatee™s estate may be ordered to repay amounts that were waived if the court finds you 
 were not eligible for the fee waiver. Ł Public benefits programs listed on the application form. In item 5 on the Request to Waive Court Fees (item 8 of the 
 Request to Waive Court Fees (Ward or Conservatee) ) , there is a list of programs from which you (or your ward or 
 conservatee) may be receiving benefits, listed by the abbreviations they are commonly known by. The full names of 
 those programs can be found in Government Code section 68632 (a) , and are also listed here: Ł Ł Food StampsŠCalifornia Food Assistance Program, Cal Fresh Program, or SNAPŁ SSPŠState Supplemental PaymentŁ Supp. Sec. Inc. ŠSupplemental Security Income (not Social Security) Ł County Relief/Gen. Assist. ŠCounty Relief, General Relief (GR) , or General Assistance (GA) Rev. January. 1, 2021 INFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF SUPERIOR COURT FEES AND COSTS FW 001 INFO, Page 2 of 2 FW 001 INFOŁ Ł Cal WORKsŠCalifornia Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids ActŁ Tribal TANFŠTribal Temporary Assistance for Needy FamiliesŁ CAPIŠCash Assistance Program for Aged, Blind, or Disabled Legal ImmigrantsŁ If you receive a fee waiver, you must tell the court if there is a change in your finances, or the finances of your ward or conservatee. You must tell the court within five days if those finances improve or if you, or your ward or conservatee, become able to pay court fees or costs during this case. (File Notice to Court of Improved Financial Situation or Settlement (form FW 010) or Notice to Court of Improved Financial Situation or Settlement (Ward or Conservatee) (form FW 010 GC) with the court. ) You may be ordered to repay any amounts that were waived after your eligibility, or the eligibility of your ward or conservatee, came to an end. Ł If you receive a judgment or support order in a family law matter: You may be ordered to pay all or part of your waived fees and costs if the court finds your circumstances have changed so that you can afford to pay. You will have 
 the opportunity to ask the court for a hearing if the court makes such a decision. Ł If you win your case in the trial court: In most circumstances the other side will be ordered to pay your waived fees and costs to the court. The court will not enter a satisfaction of judgment until the court is paid. (This does not apply in unlawful detainer cases. Special rules apply in family law cases and in guardianships and conservatorships. (Gov. Code, § 68637 (d) , (e) ; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7. 5. ) . Ł If you settle your civil case for $10, 000 or more: Any trial court waived fees and costs must first be paid to the court out of the settlement. The court will have a lien on the settlement in the amount of the waived fees and costs. The court may refuse to dismiss the case until the lien is satisfied. A request to dismiss the case (use form CIV 110) 
 must have a declaration under penalty of perjury that the waived fees and costs have been paid. Special rules apply to 
 family law cases. Ł The court can collect fees and costs due the court. If waived fees and costs are ordered paid to the trial court, or if you fail to make the payments over time, the court can start collection proceedings and add a $25 fee plus any 
 additional costs of collection to the other fees and costs owed to the court. Ł If you are in jail or state prison: Prisoners may be required to pay the full cost of the filing fee in the trial court but 
 may be allowed to do so over time. See Government Code section 68635. Ł If you want a record made of your court hearing or trial: There are various reasons why you may want a record of the hearing or trial. Among other reasons, you may want to have a record for an appeal if you disagree 
 with a court order or judgment. If you receive a fee waiver and if the court is not electronically recording the 
 proceeding, you may ask the court to have an official court reporter attend your hearing or trial at no cost to you, so 
 there can be a record of the proceeding. You should use form FW 020 to make the request, which you should file at 
 least 10 calendar days before a scheduled court date, or as soon as you can if the court date is set with less than 10-
 days™ notice. If you want a written transcript after the hearing or trial, you will need to pay the court reporter separately, or arrange to get the transcript in another way. To learn about ways to do that, talk with the court™s Self Help Center or read the information about appeals on the self help webpages at . </div>
