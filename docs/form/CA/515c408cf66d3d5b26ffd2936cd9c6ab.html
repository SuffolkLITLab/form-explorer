can be about child custody, visitation (parenting time), child support, spousal or partner support, property, 
finances, attorney’s fees and costs, or other matters.  
To change or end the domestic violence restraining orders granted by the court in Restraining Order After 
Hearing (form DV-130). See How Do I Ask to Change or End a Domestic Violence Restraining Order (form 
DV-400-INFO) for more information.

•
•

Before you have filed a Petition to start your case (form FL-300 may be filed with the Petition).
If you and the other party have an agreement. For information about how to write up your agreement, get it 
approved by the court, and filed in your case, see http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-agreeFL, talk to an 
attorney, or get help at your court’s Self-Help Center or Family Law Facilitator’s Office.
When specific Judicial Council forms must be used to ask the court for orders. For example, to ask:
–For a domestic violence restraining order, use forms DV-100, DV-109, and DV-110. 
–For an order for contempt, use form FL-410. 
–To cancel a child support order, use form FL-360 or form FL-640.

Complete form FL-300 (Page 1)
Caption: In the top box, print or type your name,
address, telephone number, and email address if 
you have one. In the second box, put the court 
address. In the third box, write the name of the 
Petitioner, Respondent, and Other Parent/Party 
(if there is one). (You must use the party names 
as they appear in the petition that was originally 
filed with the court).
In the fourth box, check “CHANGE” if you want 
to change an existing order. Check  
“TEMPORARY EMERGENCY ORDERS” if you 
are asking the court to make emergency orders 
that will be effective until the hearing date. Then, 
check all the boxes that apply to the orders you 
are requesting. In the box on the right, write the 
case number.

Item 1:  List the name(s) of the other person(s) 
               in your case who will receive your 
               request. In some cases, this might 
               include a grandparent who is joined 
               as a party in the case, a local child 
               support agency, or a lawyer who 
               represents a child in the case.
Item 2:   Leave this blank. The court clerk will 
               fill in the date, time, and place of the 
               hearing.
Item 3:  This is a notice to all other parties.

               your required child custody mediation or 
               recommending counseling appointment. 
               Other courts require the party or the 
               party’s lawyer to make the appointment 
               and then complete item 6 before filing 
               form FL-300.  

Ask your court’s Family Law Facilitator 
or Self-Help Center to find out what your

Who can be a “server”
You cannot serve the papers. Have someone else 
(who is at least 18 years old) do it. The “server” can
be a friend, a relative who is not involved in your 
case, a sheriff, or a professional process server.

“Personal Service” 
Personal service means that your “server” walks up 
to each person to be served, makes sure the right 
person is being served, and hand-delivers a copy of 
all the papers (and the blank forms). If the person 
served does not take the papers, the server may 
leave the papers near the person.

Note: Sometimes the papers may be personally 
served on the other party’s lawyer (if he or she has 
one) in the family law case.

14

“Service by mail”  
means that your “server” 
places copies of all the 
papers (including blank 
forms) in a sealed 
envelope and mails them 
to the address of each 
party being served (or to the party’s lawyer, if the 
party has one).
The server must be 18 years of age or older and  
live or work in the county where the mailing took 
place.

Important! If you have questions about personal 
service or service by mail, talk to a lawyer or 
check with your court’s Family Law Facilitator or 
Self-Help Center at http://www.courts.ca.gov/
selfhelp-courtresources.htm.

9

Temporary Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders 
(not domestic violence restraining orders)
Courts can make temporary orders in your family 
law case to respond to emergencies that cannot wait
to be heard on the court’s regular hearing calendar. 

The emergency must involve an immediate danger 
or irreparable harm to a party or children in the 
case, or an immediate loss or damage to property.

To request these orders:

Complete form FL-300. Describe the emergency 
and explain why you need the temporary 
emergency orders before the hearing.
Complete form FL-305 to serve as your proposed
temporary orders.
Include a declaration describing how and  
when you notified the other parties (or why you 
could not give notice) about your request and the 
hearing (see form FL-303).
Complete other forms if required by your  
local court rules.
Follow your court’s local procedures for  
reserving the day for the hearing, submitting your
paperwork, and paying filing fees.

10

General information about “service”
“Service” is the act of giving your legal papers to 
all persons named as parties in the case so that they 
know what orders you are asking for and have 
information about the hearing. 

If the other parties are NOT properly served, the 
judge cannot make the orders you requested on the 
date of the hearing.

11

Serve the Request for Order and blank 
forms
The other party must be “served” with a:

Copy of the Request for Order and all the other 
forms and attachments filed with the court clerk.
Copy of any temporary emergency orders 
granted.
Blank form FL-320, Responsive Declaration to  
Request for Order.
Blank form FL-150, Income and Expense 
Declaration (if you served form FL-150 or 
FL-155).

Information Sheet for Request for Order 
(Family Law)

FL-300-INFO,  Page 3 of 4

Service by Mail 
If you are not required to use personal service, you  
may use service by mail. 
Important! Check with your court’s Family Law 
Facilitator's Office or Self-Help Center, or ask a 
lawyer to be sure you are allowed to use service by  
mail in your case.
A Request for Order to change a judgment or final  
order on the issue of child custody, visitation 
(parenting time), or child support may be served by 
mail if:

The documents do not include temporary 
emergency orders;                        
The court did not order personal service; and
You have verified the other party’s current home 
or office address. (You may use Declaration 
Regarding Address Verification (form FL-334).)

 

To change a judgment or final order on any other  
issue, including spousal or domestic partner 
support, the Request for Order may need to be 
personally served on the other party.
1.  After serving, the server must fill out a Proof of 
     Service by Mail (form FL-335) and give it to 
     you. If the server needs instructions, the Information 
     Sheet for Proof of Service by Mail  

 (form FL-335-INFO) can be provided.

2.  Take the completed Proof of Personal Service 
     form to the clerk’s office (or e-file it, if available
      in your court) at least 5 court days before your 
      hearing.
Deadline: Unless the court orders a different time, 
service by mail must be completed at least 16 court
days PLUS 5 calendar days before the hearing 
date (if service is in California). Other time lines 
apply for service outside of California. 

Personal Service 
Personal service is the best way to make sure the  
other adults in your case are correctly served. 
Sometimes you must use personal service. 

You must use personal service when the court:

Ordered personal service;

Granted temporary emergency orders;

Does not yet have the power to make orders that 
apply to the other party because he or she has 
either NOT previously:
Been served with a Summons and Petition;*

OR

Appeared in the case by filing a:
a. Response to a Petition; 
b. Appearance, Stipulations, and Waivers; 
c. Written notice of appearance;  
d. Request to strike all or part of the Petition; or
e. Request to transfer the case.

*Note: A Request for Order may be served at the 
            same time as the family law Summons  
            and Petition.

1.   After serving, the server must fill out a Proof of 
      Personal Service (form FL-330) and give it to 
you. If the server needs instructions, the  
Information Sheet for Proof of Personal Service 
(form FL-330-INFO) can be provided.

2.   Take the completed Proof of Personal Service 
      form to the clerk’s office (or e-file it, if  
      available in your court) at least 5 court days  
      before your hearing.
Deadline: The deadline for personal service is 16 
court days before the hearing date, unless the court 
orders a different deadline.
