      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>What if there has been domestic violence 
or a protective order?
The evaluator must consider any history of 
domestic violence before interviewing the parents 
or the child. The parties may request separate 
interviews with the evaluator. Give the evaluator 
copies of any restraining or protective orders.

For help, call the National Domestic Violence 
Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 (TDD: 1-800-787-3224)  
or call 211 (if available in your area).

• Counseling: If, and for how long, either parent should 
  be required to attend parenting, coparenting, domestic
  violence, substance abuse, rehabilitation, or other 
  programs.

What will the evaluator do?
The evaluator will conduct a full or limited-scope 
investigation. He or she may do all the following as 
part of the investigation: 

• Review documents related to custody, including local 
   police reports and juvenile court records; 

• Review the child’s medical, dental, mental health, and
   other health-care records and school and educational 
   records;  
• Observe parent-child interaction and interview parents,
   the child, the child’s family members, and others who 
   have had contact with the child; 
•  Interview professionals who have provided care for the 
   child; and
• Consult with other experts. 

Will the evaluator speak with our child?
Depending on the child’s age and maturity, the 
evaluator may consider observing and talking with 
your child.  

How long will the evaluation take?
This varies depending on the kinds of issues the 
evaluator must investigate. The evaluator will give 
you a written explanation of the process, which will 
describe the time frame for gathering and analyzing 
information for the evaluation.

We can’t agree on a parenting plan. So how 
will the court make a custody order?
Parents in family court need to have a plan that 
shows how their child will be cared for after they 
separate. When parents can’t agree on a parenting 
plan on their own or with the help of a mediator, 
the judge will make a decision about child custody 
at a hearing. The judge may order a child custody 
evaluation to assist in this process. A parent can 
also ask for an evaluation. This information sheet 
provides general information in cases where the 
judge appoints a child custody evaluator. 

What is a child custody evaluation?
It is an investigation and analysis of the health, 
safety, welfare, and best interest of the child. In 
cases where the court has determined there is an  
allegation of child sexual abuse, state law requires 
that the evaluator conduct a detailed investigation 
if the court is considering permanent child custody 
or visitation orders. The evaluation is usually 
completed by a licensed psychologist, marriage 
and family therapist, clinical social worker, or 
psychiatrist. The evaluator may be a private 
professional, a court employee, or a professional 
under contract with the court.

What kind of evaluation will be done?
The evaluator will follow the court order by  
investigating and making recommendations that 
address the issues raised in your case. For example, 
the court might order the evaluator to make a 
recommendation about these and other issues:
• Legal custody: Who makes major decisions
   about the child’s health, education, and welfare;
  
• Physical custody: Whom the child lives with;
• Parenting plan or visitation: The schedule of  
 
  when the child spends time with each parent;
 
• Supervised visitation: Whether visitation  
  should be supervised and, if so, by what type 
  
  of program and for how long;
• Safety issues: The protection needs of the child 
  in cases involving allegations of domestic violence
  or child sexual abuse. 
• Child custody modification: Whether an existing
   child custody order should be changed.

FL-329-INFO Child Custody Evaluation Information Sheet

What do I need to do after the court orders 
the evaluation?
1. Follow the court order about initial contact with
    the evaluator.
2. Promptly provide documents and information to  
    the evaluator and to the other party at the same 
    time.
 
3. If needed, sign release forms to allow the evaluator 
    access to documents and the child's care providers.
4. Fully cooperate with the evaluation. 
 
Will I have to pay for the evaluation?
Fees and costs for the evaluation are often paid by 
the parents; however, sometimes evaluations
are paid for by the courts. Your order should say who 
is responsible for paying for the evaluation.

What happens after the evaluator completes 
the investigation? 
If the court orders it, the evaluator may prepare a  
verbal or written report about the issues investigated 
in your case. The report may include recommenda- 
tions about child custody and visitation. If the court
orders the evaluator to file a written, confidential 
report about the evaluation, you or your attorney and 
any attorney appointed for the child will receive a 
copy of the confidential report 10 days before any 
hearing about custody of the child. The court may 
consider the report and receive it as evidence. The 
report will go in the confidential portion of the court’s 
file.

Is the report confidential, or can I share it 
with others? 
The child custody evaluation report is confidential.  
You must not make an unwarranted disclosure of 
the contents of the child custody evaluation report. 
By law, a court can order a fine for an unwarranted 
disclosure of the child custody evaluation report 
in an amount that is large enough to prevent the 
person from disclosing information in the future. 
The fine can include an order to pay the other 
party’s attorney fees or costs or both.

What if I disagree with the evaluator's report?
You may object to the evaluator’s report and request a 
hearing to explain your concerns to the court. If 
you do not have an attorney, you may wish to get legal 
help with this matter. Read the local rules of the family

law court in your county to find out how to request a 
hearing.

What if I have an issue about how the 
evaluation was conducted?
• Discuss your concern with the evaluator or the 
   evaluator's supervisor to try to resolve the issue.
• Contact the clerk of the court to find out the 
   court’s procedures for making and responding 
   to complaints about an evaluator. 
• Follow any complaint procedures posted in the 
  evaluator’s office. 
• Submit your complaint to the court so the court 
   can respond to your concern. 
•  Contact your court’s self-help center or 
   facilitator program for more information.
• Consult with an attorney about raising your 
   concern as part of your case. See information 
   below about where to find legal help.

Does my court have special rules or forms?
Courts in most counties have local rules and forms 
for cases involving child custody evaluations. Courts
generally provide online access to their local rules and 
forms. See www.courtinfo.ca.gov/rules/localrules/htm.
You may also contact the family law facilitator or 
self-help center at the superior court in your county.

Where can I get more information about child 
custody evaluations?
1. Visit the California Courts Online Self-Help 
    Center Web site: www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp.
2. Ask at your local law library or public library.
3. Read Family Code sections 3110–3118 and 3025.5.
4. Read rules 5.220 and 5.225 of the California 
    Rules of Court.

Where can I get information or legal advice?
1. Talk to your lawyer if you have one.
2. Contact the family law facilitator or self-help center
    for referrals to local legal services providers and 
    lawyer referral services.
3. Find a lawyer through your local bar association or 
    the State Bar of California at http://calbar.ca.gov.
    Or call the Lawyer Referral Service at  
    866-442-2529 or 415-538-2250.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
