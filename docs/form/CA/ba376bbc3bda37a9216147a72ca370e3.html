      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: TELEPHONE NO. : DUTIES OF GUARDIANWhen you are appointed by the court as a guardian of a minor, you become an officer of the court and assume certain duties and obligations. An attorney is best qualified to advise you about these matters. You should clearly understand the 
 information on this form. You will find additional information in the Guardianship Pamphlet (for Guardianships of Children in the Probate Court) (Form GC 205) , which is available from the court. 1. GUARDIANSHIP OF THE PERSONIf the probate court appoints you as a guardian of the person for a child, you will be required to assume important duties and obligations. a. Fundamental responsibilities - The guardian of the person of a child has the care, custody, and control of the child. As guardian, you are responsible for providing for food, clothing, shelter, education, and all the medical and dental needs of the child. You must provide for the safety, protection, and physical and emotional 
 growth of the child. Custody - As guardian of the person of the child, you have full legal and physical custody of the child and are responsible for all decisions relating to the child. The child's parents can no longer make decisions for the child while there is a guardianship. The parents' rights are suspendedŠnot terminatedŠas long as a guardian is appointed for a minor. Education - As guardian of the person of the child, you are responsible for the child's education. You determine where the child should attend school. As the child's advocate within the school system, you should 
 attend conferences and play an active role in the child's education. For younger children, you may want to 
 consider enrolling the child in Head Start or other similar programs. For older children, you should consider 
 their future educational needs such as college or a specialized school. You must assist the child in obtaining 
 services if the child has special educational needs. You should help the child in setting and attaining his or her 
 educational goals. Residence - As guardian, you have the right to determine where the child lives. The child will normally live with you, but when it is necessary, you are allowed to make other arrangements if it is in the best interest of 
 the child. You should obtain court approval before placing the child back with his or her parents. As guardian, you do not have the right to change the child's residence to a place outside of California unless you first receive the court's permission. If the court grants permission, California law requires that you 
 establish legal guardianship in the state where the child will be living. Individual states have different rules 
 regarding guardianships. You should seek additional information about guardianships in the state where you 
 want the child to live.

 OF (Name) : b. c. d. Form Adopted for Mandatory Use Judicial Council of California GC 248 [New January 1, 2001] Page one of five (Continued on reverse) ATTORNEY FOR (Name) : FAX NO. (Optional) : EŒMAIL ADDRESS (Optional) : GUARDIAN OF (Name) : CASE NUMBER: MINORe. Medical treatment - As guardian, you are responsible for meeting the medical needs of the child. In most cases, you have the authority to consent to the child's medical treatment. However, if the child is 14 years or 
 older, surgery may not be performed on the child unless either (1) both the child and the guardian consent or 
 (2) a court order is obtained that specifically authorizes the surgery. This holds true except in emergencies. A 
 guardian may not place a child involuntarily in a mental health treatment facility under a probate guardianship. 
 A mental health conservatorship proceeding is required for such an involuntary commitment. However, the 
 guardian may secure counseling and other necessary mental health services for the child. The law also 
 allows older and more mature children to consent to their own treatment in certain situations such as 
 outpatient mental health treatment, medical care related to pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, and 
 drug and alcohol treatment. f. Community resources - There are agencies in each county that may be helpful in meeting the specific needs of children who come from conflicted, troubled, or deprived environments. If the child has special 
 needs, you must strive to meet those needs or secure appropriate services. g. Financial support - Even when the child has a guardian, the parents are still obligated to financially support the child. The guardian may take action to obtain child support. The child may also be eligible for Temporary 
 Aid for Needy Families, TANF (formerly known as AFDC) , social security benefits, Veterans Administration 
 benefits, Indian child welfare benefits, and other public or private funds. h. Visitation - The court may require that you allow visitation or contact between the child and his or her 
 parents. The child's needs often require that the parent child relationship be maintained, within reason. 
 However, the court may place restrictions on the visits, such as the requirement of supervision. The court 
 may also impose other conditions in the child's best interest. Driver's license - As guardian of the person, you have the authority to consent to the minor's application for a driver's license. If you consent, you will become liable for any civil damages that may result if the minor 
 causes an accident. The law requires that anyone signing the DMV application obtain insurance to cover the 
 minor. i. Enlistment in the armed services - The guardian may consent to a minor's enlistment in the armed services. If the minor enters into active duty with the armed forces, the minor becomes emancipated under 
 California law. Marriage - For the minor to marry, the guardian and the court must give permission. If the minor enters a valid marriage, the minor becomes emancipated under California law. Change of address - A guardian must notify the court in writing of any change in the address of either the child or the guardian. This includes any changes that result from the child's leaving the guardian's home or 
 returning to the parent's home. You must always obtain court permission before you move the child to 
 another state or country. Court visitors and status reports - Some counties have a program in which ''court visitors'' track and review guardianships. If your county has such a program, you will be expected to cooperate with all requests of the 
 court visitor. As guardian, you may also be required to fill out and file status reports. In all counties, you must 
 cooperate with the court and court investigators. Misconduct of the child - A guardian, like a parent, is liable for the harm and damages caused by the willful misconduct of a child. There are special rules concerning harm caused by the use of a firearm. If you are 
 concerned about your possible liability, you should consult an attorney. Additional responsibilities - The court may place other conditions on the guardianship or additional duties upon you, as guardian. For example, the court may require the guardian to complete counseling or parenting 
 classes, to obtain specific services for the child, or to follow a scheduled visitation plan between the child and 
 the child's parents or relatives. As guardian, you must follow all court orders. GC 248 [New January 1, 2001 ] j. k. l. m. n. o. DUTIES OF GUARDIAN (Probate) Page two of five (Continued on page three) GC 248 GUARDIAN OF (Name) : CASE NUMBER: MINORp. Termination of guardianship of the person - A guardianship of the person automatically ends when the child reaches the age of 18, is adopted, marries, is emancipated by court order, enters into active military duty, 
 or dies. If none of these events has occurred, the child, a parent, or the guardian may petition the court for 
 termination of guardianship. But it must be shown that the guardianship is no longer necessary or that 
 termination of the guardianship is in the child's best interest. 2. GUARDIANSHIP OF THE ESTATEIf the court appoints you as guardian of the child's estate, you will have additional duties and obligations. The money and other assets of the child are called the child's ''estate. "' Appointment as guardian of a child's estate 
 is taken very seriously by the court. The guardian of the estate is required to manage the child's funds, collect 
 and make an inventory of the assets, keep accurate financial records, and regularly file financial accountings 
 with the court. MANAGING THE ESTATEPrudent investments - As guardian of the estate, you must manage the child's assets with the care of a 
 prudent person dealing with someone else's property. This means that you must be cautious and may not 
 make speculative or risky investments. Keeping estate assets separate - As guardian of the estate, you must keep the money and property of the child's estate separate from everyone else's, including your own. When you open a bank account for the 
 estate, the account name must indicate that it is a guardianship account and not your personal account. You 
 should use the child's social security number when opening estate accounts. You should never deposit estate 
 funds in your personal account or otherwise mix them with your own funds or anyone else's funds, even for 
 brief periods. Securities in the estate must be held in a name that shows that they are estate property and not 
 your personal property. Interest bearing accounts and other investments - Except for checking accounts intended for ordinary expenses, you should place estate funds in interest bearing accounts. You may deposit estate funds in 
 insured accounts in federally insured financial institutions, but you should not put more than $100, 000 in any 
 single institution. You should consult with an attorney before making other kinds of investments. d. Blocked accounts - A blocked account is an account with a financial institution in which money is placed. No 
 person may withdraw funds from a blocked account without the court's permission. Depending on the amount 
 and character of the child's property, the guardian may elect or the court may require that estate assets be 
 placed in a blocked account. As guardian of the estate, you must follow the directions of the court and the 
 procedures required to deposit funds in this type of account. The use of a blocked account is a safeguard and 
 may save the estate the cost of a bond. Other restrictions - As guardian of the estate, you will have many other restrictions on your authority to deal with estate assets. Without prior court order, you may not pay fees to yourself or your attorney. You may not 
 make a gift of estate assets to anyone. You may not borrow money from the estate. As guardian, you may not 
 use estate funds to purchase real property without a prior court order. If you do not obtain the court's 
 permission to spend estate funds, you may be compelled to reimburse the estate from your own personal 
 funds and may be removed as guardian. You should consult with an attorney concerning the legal 
 requirements relating to sales, leases, mortgages, and investment of estate property. If the child of whose 
 estate you are the guardian has a living parent or if that child receives assets or is entitled to support from 
 another source, you must obtain court approval before using guardianship assets for the child's support, 
 maintenance, or education. You must file a petition or include a request for approval in the original petition, 
 and set forth which exceptional circumstances justify any use of guardianship assets for the child's support. 
 The court will ordinarily grant such a petition for only a limited period of time, usually not to exceed one year, 
 and only for specific and limited purposes. INVENTORY OF ESTATE PROPERTYf. Locate the estate's property - As guardian of the estate, you must locate, take possession of, and protect the child's income and assets that will be administered in the estate. You must change the ownership of all 
 assets into the guardianship estate's name. For real estate, you should record a copy of your Letters of
 Guardianship with the county recorder in each county where the child owns real property. a. b. c. e. GC 248 [New January 1, 2001 ] DUTIES OF GUARDIAN (Probate) Page three of five (Continued on reverse) GC 248 g. Determine the value of the property - As guardian of the estate, you must arrange to have a court appointed referee determine the value of the estate property unless the appointment is waived by the court. YouŠnot the 
 refereeŠmust determine the value of certain ''cash items. '' An attorney can advise you about how to do this. File an inventory and appraisal - As guardian of the estate, you must file an inventory and appraisal within 90 days after your appointment. You may be required to return to court 90 days after your appointment as 
 guardian of the estate to ensure that you have properly filed the inventory and appraisal. INSURANCEInsurance coverage - As guardian of the estate, you should make sure that there is appropriate and sufficient insurance covering the assets and risks of the estate. You should maintain the insurance in force throughout 
 the entire period of the guardianship or until the insured asset is sold. RECORD KEEPING AND ACCOUNTINGRecords - As guardian of the estate, you must keep complete, accurate records of each financial transaction affecting the estate. The checkbook for the guardianship checking account is essential for keeping records of 
 income and expenditures. You should also keep receipts for all purchases. Record keeping is critical because 
 you will have to prepare an accounting of all money and property that you have received, what you have 
 spent, the date of each transaction, and its purpose. You will also have to be able to describe in detail what is 
 left after you have paid the estate's expenses. Accountings - As guardian of the estate, you must file a petition requesting that the court review and approve your accounting one year after your appointment and at least every two years after that. The court may ask 
 that you justify some or all expenditures. You should have receipts and other documents available for the 
 court's review, if requested. If you do not file your accounting as required, the court will order you to do so. You 
 may be removed as guardian for failure to file an accounting. Format - As guardian of the estate, you must comply with all state and local rules when filing your accounting. A particular format is specified in the Probate Code, which you must follow when you present your account to 
 the court. You should check local rules for any special local requirements. Legal advice - An attorney can advise you and help you prepare your inventories, accountings, and petitions to the court. If you have questions, you should consult with an attorney. 3. OTHER GENERAL INFORMATIONRemoval of a guardian - A guardian may be removed for specific reasons or when it is in the child's best interest. A guardian may be removed either on the court's own motion or by a petition filed by the child, a 
 relative of the child, or any other interested person. If necessary, the court may appoint a successor guardian, 
 or the court may return the child to a parent if that is found to be in the child's best interest. Legal documents - For your appointment as guardian to be valid, the Order Appointing Guardian of Minor must be signed. Once the court signs the order, the guardian must go to the clerk's office, where Letters of 
 Guardianship will be issued. Letters of Guardianship is a legal document that provides proof that you have 
 been appointed and are serving as the guardian of a minor. You should obtain several certified copies of the 
 Letters from the clerk. These legal documents will be of assistance to you in the performance of your duties, 
 such as enrolling the child in school, obtaining medical care, and taking care of estate business. Attorneys and legal resources - If you have an attorney, the attorney will advise you on your duties and responsibilities, the limits of your authority, the rights of the child, and your dealings with the court. If you have legal questions, you should consult with your attorney. Please remember that the court staff cannot
 give you legal advice. Page four of five GC 248 [New January 1, 2001 ] DUTIES OF GUARDIAN (Probate) GUARDIAN OF (Name) : CASE NUMBER: MINORh. i. j. k. l. m. a. b. c.
