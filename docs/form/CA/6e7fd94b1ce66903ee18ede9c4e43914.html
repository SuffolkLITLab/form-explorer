The court having previously determined that the minor is a dual status child under Welf. & Inst. Code, § 241.1(e)(5)(A) and 
that juvenile court jurisdiction over the minor as a dependent should be resumed, orders: 
a.  

 Dependency jurisdiction over the minor previously suspended is resumed and delinquency jurisdiction is dismissed.

on the record which is within six months of the date of the minor's most recent status review hearing under Welf. & Inst. 
Code, § 727.2 or § 727.3.

The court  having previously determined that the minor is a dual status child under Welf. & Inst. Code, § 241.1(e)(5)(B), that 
the child's rehabilitative goals were achieved, that a return to the minor's home would be detrimental, and that juvenile court 
jurisdiction over the minor as a dual status child is no longer required, orders: 
a.  

The child's dual status is terminated, delinquency jurisdiction over the minor is dismissed, and dependency jurisdiction is 
continued with the child welfare services department responsible for the child's placement and care.

b.   The matter is continued for a status review hearing set under Welf. & Inst. Code, § 366.21 or § 366.3 on the date stated

well-being.
