      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: SC 100 INFOINFORMATION FOR THE SMALL CLAIMS PLAINTIFF WHAT IS SMALL CLAIMS COURT? Small claims court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively. The rules are simple and informal. The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court, but you cannot have a lawyer in court. Your claim cannot be for more than $5, 000 if you are a business or public entity or for more than $10, 000 if you are a natural person (including a sole proprietor) . (See below for reference to exceptions. *) If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may sue in the civil division of the trial court or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over the limit. You cannot, however, file more than two cases in small claims court for more than 
 $2, 500 each during a calendar year. WHO CAN FILE A CLAIM? You must be at least 18 years old to file a claim. If you are not yet 18, tell the clerk. You may ask the court to appoint a 
 guardian ad litem. This is a person who will act for you in the case. The guardian ad litem is usually a parent, a relative, or 
 an adult friend. You must also appear at the small claims hearing yourself 
 unless you filed the claim for a corporation or other entity 
 that is not a natural person. If a corporation files a claim, an employee, an officer, or a director must act on its behalf. If the claim is filed on behalf of an association or another entity that is not a natural person, a regularly employed person of the entity must act on its behalf. 
 A person who appears on behalf of a corporation or another 
 entity must not be employed or associated solely for the purpose of representing the corporation or other entity in the small claims court. You must file a declaration with the court to appear in any of these instances. (See Authorization to Appear, form SC 109. ) A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible. This means that you have asked the defendant to pay, and the defendant has refused. If your claim 
 is for possession of property, you must ask the defendant to 
 give you the property. Unless you fall within two technical exceptions, you must be the original owner of the claim. This means that if the claim is assigned, the buyer cannot sue in the small claims court. WHERE CAN YOU FILE YOUR CLAIM? You must sue in the right court and location. This rule is called venue. Check the court's local rules if there is more than one court location in the county handling small claims cases. If you file your claim in the wrong court, the court will dismiss the claim unless all 
 defendants personally appear at the hearing and agree that the claim may be heard. The right location may be any of these: SOME RULES ABOUT THE DEFENDANT (including government agencies) You must sue using the defendant's exact legal name. If the defendant is a business or a corporation and you do not know 
 the exact legal name, check with the state or local licensing 
 agency, the county clerk's office, or the Office of the Secretary of State, Corporate Status Unit, at www. sos. ca. gov/business. Ask the clerk for help if you do not know how to find this information. If you do not use the defendant's exact legal 
 name, the court may be able to correct the name on your claim 
 at the hearing or after the judgment. If you want to sue a government agency, you must first file a 
 claim with the agency before you can file a lawsuit in court. 
 Strict time limits apply. If you are in a Department of 
 Corrections or Youth Authority facility, you must prove that the 
 agency denied your claim. Please attach a copy of the denial 
 to your claim. HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT FIND OUT ABOUT THE CLAIM? You must make sure the defendant finds out about your lawsuit. This has to be done according to the rules or your case may be 
 dismissed or delayed. The correct way of telling the defendant about the lawsuit is called service of process. This means giving the defendant a copy of the claim. YOU CANNOT DO THIS YOURSELF. You should read form SC 104 B, What is "Proof of Service"? Here are four ways to serve the defendant: Process serverŠYou may ask anyone who is not a party in your case and who is at least 18 years old to serve the defendant. The person is called a process server and must personally give a copy of your claim to the defendant. The 
 person must also sign a proof of service form showing when 
 the defendant was served. Registered process servers will 
 serve papers for a fee. You may also ask a friend or relative to 
 do it. * Exceptions: Different limits apply in an action against a defendant who is a guarantor. (See Code Civ. Proc. , § 116. 220 (c) . ) Page 1 of 2 Form Adopted for Mandatory Use 
 Judicial Council of California 
 SC 100 INFO [Rev. January 1, 2020] INFORMATION FOR THE PLAINTIFF (Small Claims) Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 116. 110 et seq. , 116. 220 (c) , 116. 340 (g) www. courts. ca. gov This information sheet is written for the person who sues in the small claims court. It explains some of the rules of, and 
 some general information about, the small claims court. It may also be helpful for the person who is sued. 1. 2. 3. 4. Where the defendant lives or where the business involved is located; Where the damage or accident happened; 1. 2. 1. 2. Service by a law officerŠYou may ask the marshal or sheriff to serve the defendant. A fee will be charged. 1. 2. With very limited exceptions, the defendant must be served within the state of California. 3. Where the contract was signed or carried out; 3. 4. If the defendant is a corporation, where the contract was broken; or 5. For a retail installment account or sales contract or a motor 
 vehicle finance sale: a. Where the goods or vehicle are permanently kept. d. Where the buyer signed the contract; orc. Where the buyer lived when the contract was entered into; b. Where the buyer lives; Certified mailŠYou may ask the clerk of the court to serve the defendant by certified mail. The clerk will charge a fee. 
 You should check back with the court before the hearing to 
 see if the receipt for certified mail was returned to the court. 
 Service by certified mail must be done by the clerk's 
 office except in motor vehicle accident cases involving 
 out of state defendants. Substituted serviceŠThis method lets you serve another person instead of the defendant. You must follow the 
 procedures carefully. You may also wish to use the marshal or 
 sheriff or a registered process server. 3. 4. Substituted service (continued) A copy of your claim must be left at the defendant's business with the person in charge, OR at the defendant's home with a competent person who is at least 18 years old. The person who receives the claim must 
 be told about its contents. Another copy must be mailed, first 
 class postage prepaid, to the defendant at the address where the paper was left. The service is not complete until 10 days after the copy is mailed. Timing and proof of serviceŠNo matter which method of service you choose, the defendant must be served by a certain date, or the trial will be postponed. If the defendant lives in the county, service must be completed at least 15 days before the trial date. This period is at least 20 days if the defendant lives outside the county. The person who serves the defendant must sign a court paper showing when the defendant was served. This paper is 
 called a Proof of Service (form SC 104) . It must be signed and returned to the court clerk as soon as the defendant has been 
 served. WHAT IF THE DEFENDANT ALSO HAS A CLAIM? Sometimes the person who was sued (the defendant) will also have a claim against the person who filed the lawsuit (the plaintiff) . This claim is called the Defendant's Claim. The defendant may file this claim in the same lawsuit. This helps to resolve all of the disagreements between the parties at the same time. If the defendant decides to file the claim in the small claims court, the claim may not be for more than $5, 000, or $10, 000 if the defendant is a natural person (see exceptions on page 1*) . If the value of the claim is more than this amount, the defendant may either give up the amount over $5, 000 or $10, 000 and sue in the small claims court or sue in the appropriate court for the full value of the 
 claim. If the defendant's claim relates to the same contract, transaction, matter, or event that is the subject of your claim and exceeds 
 the value amount for small claims court, the defendant may file the claim in the appropriate court and file a motion to transfer your claim 
 to that court to resolve both claims together. The defendant's claim must be served on the plaintiff at least five days before the trial. If the defendant received the plaintiff's claim 10 days or less before the trial, then the claim must be served at least one day before the trial. Both claims will be heard by the court at the same time. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE TRIAL? Be sure you are on time for the trial. The small claims trial is informal. You must bring with you all witnesses, books, receipts, and other papers or things to prove your case. You may ask the witnesses to come to court voluntarily, or you may ask the clerk to issue a subpoena. A subpoena is a court order that requires the witness to go to trial. The witness has a right to charge a fee for going to the trial. If you do not have the records or papers to prove your case, you may also get a court order before the trial date requiring the papers to be brought to the trial. This order is called a Small Claims Subpoena and Declaration (form SC 107) . If you settle the case before the trial, you must file a dismissal form with the clerk. The court's decision is usually mailed to you after the trial. It may also be hand delivered to you when the trial is over and after the judge has made a decision. The decision appears on a form called the Notice of Entry of Judgment (form SC 130 or SC 200) . WHAT HAPPENS AFTER JUDGMENT? The court may have ordered one party to pay money to the other party. The party who wins the case and is owed the money is called the judgment creditor. The party who loses the case and owes the money is called the judgment debtor. Enforcement of the judgment is postponed until the time for appeal ends or until the appeal is decided. This means that the judgment creditor cannot collect any money or take any action until this period is over. Generally both parties may be represented by lawyers after judgment. More information about your rights after judgment is available on the back of the Notice of Entry of Judgment. The clerk may also have this information on a separate sheet. SC 100 INFO [Rev. January 1, 2020] INFORMATION FOR THE PLAINTIFF (Small Claims) Page 2 of 2 HOW TO GET HELP WITH YOUR CASEParties who are in jailŠIf you are in jail, the court may excuse you from going to the trial. Instead, you may ask another person who is not an attorney to go to the trial for you. 
 You may mail written declarations to the court to support your 
 case. LawyersŠBoth parties may ask a lawyer about the case, but 
 a lawyer may not represent either party in court at the small 
 claims trial. Generally, after judgment and on appeal, both 
 parties may be represented by lawyers. InterpretersŠIf you do not speak English well, ask the court clerk as soon as possible for a court provided interpreter. You 
 may use form INT 300 or a local court form to request an 
 interpreter. If a court interpreter is not available at the time of 
 your trial, it may be necessary to reschedule your trial. You 
 cannot bring your own interpreter for the trial unless the 
 interpreter has been approved by the court as a certified, 
 registered, or provisionally qualified interpreter. (See Cal. 
 Rules of Court, rule 2. 893, and form INT 140. ) 
 AccommodationsŠIf you have a disability and need 
 assistance, immediately ask the court to help accommodate 
 your needs. If you are hearing impaired and need assistance, 
 notify the court immediately. FormsŠYou can get small claims forms and more information at the California Courts Self Help Center website (www. courts. ca. gov/smallclaims) , your county law library, or the courthouse nearest you. Waiver of feesŠThe court charges fees for some of its procedures. Fees are also charged for serving the defendant with the claim. The court may excuse you from paying these fees if you cannot afford them. Ask the clerk for the Information 
 Sheet on Waiver of Superior Court Fees and Costs (form FW 001 INFO) to find out if you meet the requirements so that you do not have to pay the fees. Small claims advisorsŠThe law requires each county to 
 provide assistance in small claims cases free of charge. (Small claims advisor information) : Night and Saturday courtŠIf you cannot go to court during working hours, ask the clerk if the court has trials at night or on Saturdays. 4. 1. 2. 3. 5. 6. 7. 8. 4. 5. </div>
