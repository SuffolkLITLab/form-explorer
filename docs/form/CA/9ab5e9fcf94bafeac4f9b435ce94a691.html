 Information on Appeal Procedures for Misdemeanors
 This information sheet tells you about appeals in 
 misdemeanor
 cases. 
 It is
 only
 meant to give you a 
 general idea of the appeal process, so it 
 does not cover 
 everything you may need to know about appeals in 
 misdemeanor cases. To learn more, you shoul
 d read 
 rules 8. 800
 Œ8. 816 and 8. 850
 Œ8. 890 of the California 
 Rules of Court, which set out the procedures for 
 misdemeanor appeals. You can get these rules at any 
 
 courthouse or county law library or online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/rules
 . A misdemeanor is a c
 rime that can be punished by jail 
 time of up to one year, but not by 
 time in state 
 prison. 
 (See
 Penal Code sections 17 and 19. 2
 . You can get a 
 copy of these laws at 
 http: //leginfo. legislature. ca. gov 
 /faces/codes. xhtml
 . ) If you were 
 also 
 charged with or 
 convicted of a felony, then your case is a felony case, not
 a misdemeanor case. 
 An appeal is a request to a higher court to review a 
 decision made by a lower court. 
 In a misdemeanor 
 case, the court hearing the appeal
 is the appellate 
 division of the sup
 erior court and the lower court
 Šcalled 
 the 
 ﬁtrial court
 ﬂ in this information sheet
 Šis 
 the superior court. 
 It is important to understand that 
 an appeal is 
 NOT
 a new trial
 . The appellate division will not consider new 
 evidence, such as the testimony 
 of new 
 witnesses or new 
 exhibits. The appellate division™s job is to review a 
 record of what happened in the trial court and the trial 
 court™s decision to see if certain kinds of legal errors 
 
 were made in the case: 
 Prejudicial error: 
 The party that appeals (call
 ed the 
 ﬁappellantﬂ) may ask the appellate division to 
 determine if an error was made about either the law 
 or court procedures in the case that caused 
 
 substantial harm to the appellant (this is called 
 ﬁprejudicial errorﬂ) . 
 Prejudicial error can include 
 thin
 gs like errors made by the judge about the law, 
 errors or misco
 nduct by the lawyers, incorrect
 instructions given to the jury, and misconduct by the 
 jury that harmed the appellant. When it conducts its 
 review, the appellate division presumes
 that the 
 judgment, order, or other decision being appealed is 
 
 correct. It is the responsibility 
 of the appellant to 
 show the appellate division that an error was made 
 and that the
 error was harmful. 
 No substantial evidence: 
 The appellant may also ask 
 the
 appellate division to determine if there was 
 substantial evidence supporting the 
 judgment
 , order, 
 or other 
 decision
 being appealed
 . When it conducts 
 its 
 review, 
 the appellate division 
 only 
 looks to see if 
 there was evidence
 that 
 reasonably 
 supports the 
 decision
 . The appellate division generally will not 
 reconsi
 der the jury™s or trial court™s
 conclusion about 
 which side ha
 d more or stronger evidence or whether 
 witnesses were telling the truth or lying. 
 The appellate division generally will not overturn the
 judgment, order, or other decision
 being appealed
 unless the record clearly shows that one of these legal 
 errors 
 was made. 
 You 
 will probably need 
 a lawyer
 . You are 
 not 
 allowed to 
 represent yourself in an appeal in a misdemeanor case
 unless
 the appel
 late division 
 permits you
 to do so
 . But 
 appeals can be complicated
 , and you
 would
 have to 
 follow the same rules that lawyers have to follow. If you 
 have any questions about the appeal procedures, you 
 should talk to a lawyer. 
 If 
 the appellate division 
 per
 mits you 
 to 
 represent
 yourself, you must put your address, telephone number,

 you file with the court and let the

 if 
 this
 contact information changes so that 
 the court 
 can contact
 you if needed. 
 If the appellate division does not permit you to represent 
 yourself, you must hire a lawyer at your own expense or 
 
 ask the court to appoint a lawyer to represent you. 
 The court is required to appoint a lawyer to represent 
 you if you are indigent (you cannot afford to pay for a 
 
 lawyer) and: 
 You were convicted and y
 our punishment includes 
 going to jail or paying
 a fine of more than $
 500 (including
 penalty and other assessments) 
 ; or You are likely to suffer other 
 negative con
 sequences 
 from the conviction (for example, immigration 
 problems or 
 inab
 ility to get or keep a license or 
 permit
 ) ; or You have not been convicted but y
 ou are likely to 
 suffer significant harm if you lose 
 the 
 appeal. 
 See rule 8. 851 of the California Rules
 of Court for more 
 information about when the court is required to 
 appoint a 
 lawyer to represent you. 
 The court may, but is not required to, appoint a lawyer to 
 represent you on appeal in other circumstances if you are 
 indigent. You are automatically cons
 idered indigent if 
 you were represented by the public defender or o
 ther 
 court
 -appointed lawyer in the trial court. You will also 
 be considered indigent if you can show that your income 
 
 and assets are too low to pay for a lawyer. 
 If you think you are indi
 gent, you can ask th
 e court 
 to 
 appoint a lawyer to represent you fo
 r your appeal. You 
 may use 
 Request for Court
 -Appointed Lawyer in 
 Misdemeanor 
 Appeal

 -133) to ask the 
 court 
 to 
 appoint a lawyer to represent you on appeal in a 
 misdemeanor case. You

 Only a party in 
 the
 trial court case can appeal a decision 
 in that case. You may not appeal on 
 behalf of a friend, 
 a spouse, a child, or another relative. 
 
 The pa
 rty that is appealing is called the APPELLANT; 
 in a misdemeanor case, this is usually the party
 convicted of committing the misdemeanor. The other 
 party is called the RESPONDENT; in a misde
 meanor 
 case, this is
 usually the government agency that 
 filed the 
 criminal charges
 (on court papers, this party is called the 
 People of the State of California) . 
 In some cases, the 
 
 government agen
 cy is the appella
 nt and the party against

 No. Generally, you may appeal
 only the final judgment 
 Šthe decision at the end that decides the whole case. 
 
 The final judgment includes the punishment that
 the

 With the exception listed below, 
 rulings 
 made

 appeals th

 First, you must 
 file a notice of appeal. The notice of 
 appeal tells the other party in the case and the trial court 
 that you are appealing the trial court™s de
 cision. You 
 may use 
 Notice of Appeal (Misdemean
 or) 
 (form 
 CR 132) to prepare and file a notice of appeal in a 
 misd
 emeanor case. You can get form CR
 -132 at any 
 courthouse or county law library or online at 
 
 www. co
 urts. ca. gov/forms
 . Yes. 
 Except in the 
 very limited circumstances listed in 
 rule 8. 853 (b) , in a misdemeanor case, you must file your 
 notice of appeal wi
 thin 
 30 days
 after the trial court 
 makes 
 (ﬁrendersﬂ) 
 its final judgment in your case or 
 issues 
 the order you are appealing. (You can get a cop
 y of rule 8. 853 
 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. cour
 ts. c
 a. gov/rules
 ) . The date the trial
 court makes its judgment is normally the date the trial 
 
 court issues its order saying what your
 punishment is 
 (sentences you) . 
 This deadline f
 or filing the notice of 
 appeal cannot be extended. 
 If your notice 
 of appeal is 
 late, 
 the appellate division will 
 not be able to consider 
 your appeal. 
 To file the notice of appeal in a misdemeanor case, 
 you 
 must bring or mail the original notice of 
 appeal to the 
 clerk of the trial court that made the judgment or issued 
 the order you are appealing. 
 It is a good
 idea to bring or 
 mail an extra copy to the clerk and ask the clerk to stamp 
 it to show th
 at the
 original has been filed. 
 There is no fee for 
 filing the notice of appeal in a 
 misdemeanor case. You can ask the clerk of that court if 
 there are any other req
 uirements for filing your notice of 
 appeal. 
 After you file your notice of appeal, the clerk wil
 l send a 
 copy of your notice of appeal to the o
 ffice of the 
 prosecuting attorney (for example, the district attorney, 
 county counsel, city attorney, or state At
 torney General) . 
 Filing the notice of appeal does NOT automatically 
 postpone your punish
 ment, such as serving time in jail, 
 paying fine
 s, or probation conditions. 
 
 If you have been sentenced to jail in a misdemeanor 
 case, you have a right to be r
 eleased either with or 
 without bail while your appeal is waiting to be decided, 
 but you must 
 ask the court to set bail or release you. If 
 the trial court has not set bail 
 or released you 
 after your 
 notice of appeal has been filed, you must ask the tria
 l cou
 rt to set bail or release you. 
 If the trial court denies 
 your release or sets the bail amou
 nt higher than you 
 think it should be, you can
 apply to the appellate 
 division for release or for lower bail. 
 Other parts of your punishment, such as fines or
 probation
 conditions, will be postponed (ﬁs
 tayedﬂ
 ) only 
 if you request a stay and the court gra
 nts your request. If 
 you want a stay, you must 
 first ask the trial court for a 
 stay. You can also apply to the appellate division for a 
 stay, but you must show 
 in your application to 
 the 
 appellate division that you first asked the trial court 
 for 
 a stay an
 d that the trial court unjustifiably denied you
 r request. 
 If you do not get a stay and you do not pay your 
 fine or complete another part of your punishment by t
 he 
 date ordered by the court, a warrant may be issued for 
 your arrest 
 or a civil collections pro
 cess may be started 
 against you, which could re
 sult in a civil penalty being 
 added to your fine. 
 
 You must tell the trial court 
 (1) 
 whether y
 ou have agree
 d with the respondent (
 ﬁstipulated
 ﬂ) that you do not need 
 parts 
 of the normal record
 on appeal
 , and (2) 
 whether 
 you want a record of what was s
 aid in the trial court (this 
 is called a record of the ﬁoral proceedingsﬂ) 
 sent to the 
 appellate division
 and, if
 so, what form of that record 
 you want to use. 
 You may use 
 Notice Regarding Record

 Within 10 days after the court decides whether 
 to appoint 
 a lawyer to represent 
 you (if you ask 
 the court to appoint a lawyer within 20 days 
 after you file your 
 notice of appeal) . 
 
 
 
 
 You do not 
 have
 to send the appellate division a record 
 of what was 
 said in the trial court. But if you want to 
 rai
 se any issue in your appeal that would require the 
 appellate division to consider what was said in the trial 
 cour
 t, the appellate division will need a record of these 
 oral proceedings. 
 For example, if you are 
 claiming that 
 there was not substantial evidenc
 e supporting the
 judgment, order, or other decision you are appealing, the 
 appellate division will need a record 
 of the oral
 proceedings. 
 Since the appellate division judges were 
 
 not there for the proceedings 
 in the trial court, an official 
 record of these
 oral proceedings must be prepared and 
 sent to the appellate division for its review. 
 Depending on what form of 
 the record you choose to 
 use, you will be responsible for paying to have the 
 official record of 
 the oral proceedings prepared 
 (unless 
 you are i
 ndigent
 ) or for preparing an initial draft of this 
 record yourself. If you do not take care of these 
 responsibili
 ties, a record of the oral proceedings in the 
 trial court will not be prepared and sent to the a
 ppellate 
 division. 
 If the appellate division do
 es not receive this 
 record, it will not be able to consider what wa
 s said 
 in 
 the trial court in deciding whether 
 a legal error was made
 
 and it may dismiss your appeal
 . 
 There are three ways a record of th
 e oral proceedings in 
 the trial court can be pr
 epared and provided to the 
 appellate division in a misdemeanor case: 
 a. If a court reporter was 
 there
 during the 
 trial court 
 proceedings, the reporter can prepare a record 
 
 called a 
 ﬁreporter™s transcript. ﬂ
 
 b. If the proceedings were officially electronic
 ally 
 recorded, the trial court can have a transcript 
 prepared from that recording; or if the 
 court 
 has a 
 local ru
 le permitting this and you and the 
 respondent (the prosecuting agency) agree 
 
 (ﬁstipulate
 ﬂ) to th
 is, you can use the 
 official 
 electronic recordi
 ng itself as the record, instead of 
 a transcript. 
 c. You can use a 
 statement on appeal. 
 Read below for more info
 rmation about these options. 
 a. Reporter™s transcript
 When available
 : In some misdemeanor case
 s, a 
 court reporter is 
 there
 in the trial court
 and makes 
 a record of the oral proceedings. If a court report
 er made a record of your case, you can ask to have 
 the court reporter prepare a transcript of those oral 
 proceedings, called a ﬁreporter™s transcr
 ipt. ﬂ You 
 should check with th
 e trial court to 
 see if a court
 reporter made a record of your case before you 
 choose this option. 
 Some courts also have local 
 rul
 es that establish proce
 dures
 for de
 cid
 ing 
 whether 
 a statement on appeal or a transcript of 
 only 
 some of the oral proceedings will be a good 
 eno
 ugh record to consider the issues you are 
 raising on appeal
 . You should check whether the 
 court has such a local 
 rule. 
 Cost
 : Ordinarily, the appellant must pay for 
 preparing a reporter™s transcript. The court
 reporter will provide the clerk of the trial c
 ourt 
 with an estimate of the cost of preparing the 
 transcript and the clerk will notify you of this 
 estimate. If 
 you want the reporter to prepare a 
 transcript, you must deposit this estimated amount
 or one of 
 the substitutes allowed under rule 8. 866
 with t
 he clerk within 10 days after the clerk sends 
 you the estimate. 
 However, under rule 8. 866 you 
 can decide to use a
 different form 
 of the record or 
 take other action instead of proceeding with a 
 reporter™s trans
 cript. 
 If, however, you are indigent (you ca
 nnot afford to 
 pay the cost
 of a reporter™s transcript
 ) , you may be 
 able to get a free transcript. If you were 
 represented by the public defender or another 
 court
 -appointed lawyer in the trial court, you are 
 automatically 
 considered indigent. If you were n
 ot 
 represented by a court
 -appointed lawyer in the 
 trial court, you can complete and file

 transcript. When the reporter completes the 
 transcript, the clerk will send the repor
 ter™s 
 transcript to the appellate division
 alon
 g with the 
 clerk™s transcript
 . b. Official electronic recording or transcript 
 
 from 
 an official recording
 When av
 ailable: 
 In some misdemeanor cases, the 
 trial court proceedings are officially recorded on 
 appr
 oved electronic recording equipment. 
 If your 
 case was officially recorded, you can ask to have a 
 transcript prepared from that official electronic 
 recording. 
 You
 should check with the trial court to 
 see if your case was officially electronically 
 recorded b
 efore you choose this option. 
 As with 
 reporter™
 s transcripts, some courts also have local 
 rules that establish procedures for deciding 
 
 whether a statement on ap
 peal or a transcript of 
 only some of the oral proceedings will be a good 
 
 enough record to cons
 ider the issues you are 
 raising on appeal. You
 should check whether the 
 court has such a local rule. 
 If 
 the court 
 has a local rule 
 for the appellate 
 division 
 permitting this and all the parties agree
 (ﬁstipulate
 ﬂ) , a copy of the official electronic 
 reco
 rding itself ca
 n be used as the record of the
 oral proceedings instead of preparing a transcript. 
 You should check with the trial court to see if your 
 case was o
 fficially electronically recorded and 
 check to make sure there is 
 a local 
 rule permitting 
 the 
 use of the recording itself be
 fore choosing thi
 s option. 
 If you choose this option, you must attach 
 a copy of 
 your
 agreement 
 with the other parties 
 (called a ﬁsti
 pulationﬂ) to your notice
 regarding 
 the 
 oral 
 proceedings. 
 Cost: 
 Ordinarily, the appellant mu
 st pay for 
 preparing a transcript or making a c
 opy of the 
 official electronic recording. 
 The court will send 
 you an estimate of the cost for this transcript
 or th
 e copy of the electronic recording
 . If you still want 
 this transcript
 or recording
 , you must d
 eposit this 
 amount with the court. However, you
 can also 
 choose to use a statement on appeal instead, or 
 take one of the other actions listed in 
 rule 
 8. 868. 
 
 If, 
 however, you are indigent (you cannot afford to 
 pay the cost of the transcript or recording) , 
 you may be able to get a free transcript or re
 cording. If 
 you were represented by the public defender or 
 another court
 -appointed attorney in the trial court, 
 you are automatically considered indigent. If you 
 were not represented by a court
 -appointed lawye
 r in the trial court, you can complete and file
 Defendant™s Financial Statement on Eligibility for 
 Appointment of Counsel and Reimbursement
 and 
 Record on Appeal a
 t Public Expense
 (form 
 CR 105) to show that you are indigent. 
 You can 
 get form 
 CR 105 at any
 courthouse or county law 
 library or online at
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/forms
 . The 
 court will review this form to decide whether you 
 are indigent.

 If you are indigent, 
 an official electronic recording 
 of your case was made, and you show that you 
 need a transcrip
 t, the court must provide you with 
 a free trans
 cript. 
 As with reporter™s transcript
 s, whether you need a transcript depends on the 
 issues you are raising on appe
 al. If the issues you 
 are raising on appeal include that there was not 
 substantial evidence su
 pporting the judgment, 
 order, or other decision
 you are appealing or that 
 
 there was misconduct in your case that harmed
 you, that is generally enough to show that
 you 
 need a transcript. If you ask for a transcript, the 
 court may ask you what issues you are
 raising on 
 appeal a
 nd may decide that a statem
 ent on appeal 
 or a transcript of only some of the oral 
 proceedings will be a good enough record to 
 consider the iss
 ues you are raising
 . If the court finds that you are not indigent, it will 
 send you a notice 
 and you will have a chance to
 use a statement o
 n appeal instead or take one of 
 the other actions listed in 
 rule 
 8. 868
 . 
 Completion and delivery
 : Once you deposit 
 the 
 estimated cost of the transcript or the official 
 
 electronic recording with the clerk or sh
 ow the 
 court you are indigent and need a transc
 ript, the 
 clerk will have the transcript or copy of the 
 
 recording prepared. When the transcript is 
 completed or the
 copy of the official electronic 
 recording is prepared, the clerk will send the 
 transcript or 
 reco
 rding to the appellate division 
 along with 
 the clerk™s transcript. 
 c. Statement on appeal
 Description: 
 A statement on appeal is a summary 
 of the trial cour
 t proceedings approved by the trial 
 court judge who conducted those proceedings (the 
 term ﬁjud
 geﬂ includes commissioner
 s and 
 temporary judge
 s) . When available
 : If the trial court proceedings 
 were not recorded either by a court reporter or by 
 
 official ele
 ctronic recording equipment, or if you 
 do not want to use either of these forms of the 
 record, 
 you can choose
 (ﬁelectﬂ) 
 to use a statement 
 on appeal as the record of the oral proceedings in 
 the trial court (please note that it may take more of 
 your time 
 to prepare a statement on appeal than to 
 
 use either a reporter™s transcript or electronic 
 reco
 rding, if they are available) . 
 Contents: 
 A statement on appeal must include
 : A statement of the points 
 you 
 (the appellant) 
 are
 raising on appeal
 ; A summary o
 f the trial court™s rulings and 
 judgment; and
 A summary of the testimony of each witness 
 and o
 ther evidence 
 that is relevant to the 
 issues yo
 u are raising on appeal.

 . ) Preparing
 a propos
 ed statement: 
 If you choose to 
 use a statement on a
 ppeal, you must prepare a 
 proposed statement. If you are not represented by 
 a lawyer, you must
 use 
 Proposed Statement on 
 Appeal (Misdemeanor) 
 (form CR
 -135) to prepare 
 your proposed statement. You can get form 
 CR 135 at any courthouse or county law library 
 or 
 online at

 a proposed statement
 : You 
 must serve
 and file your proposed statement 
 in the 
 trial 
 court 
 within 20 days after you file your notice
 regarding the record of the oral proceedings
 . ﬁServe and fileﬂ mean
 s that
 you must:

 served the proposed statement, who was

 roposed statement, how the 
 proposed statement was served (by mail or in 
 person) , and the date 
 the proposed statement 
 was served. 
 File the o
 riginal proposed statement and the 
 proof of service with the trial court. You 
 
 should make a copy of 
 the 
 proposed st
 atement 
 you are planning to file for your own records 
 
 before you file it with the court. It is
 a good 
 idea to bri
 ng or mail an extra copy of 
 the proposed statement to the clerk when you file 
 your original and ask the clerk to stamp this 
 
 copy to show that t
 he original has been filed.

 . Review and modifications: 
 The prosecuting 
 attorney and any other party 
 have 10 
 days from th
 e date you serve your proposed statement to 
 ser
 ve and file 
 proposed changes (called ﬁamendmentsﬂ) 
 
 to this statement. The trial court judge then 
 reviews both your 
 proposed statement and any 
 proposed ame
 ndments 
 filed by the 
 prosecuting 
 attorney and any other
 party
 . The judge will then 
 make or order you t
 o make any corrections or 
 modifications to the statement needed to 
 make 
 sure that the statement provides a complete
 and 
 accurate summary of the 
 relevant testimony
 and 
 other evidence
 . Completion and certifica
 tion: 
 If the judge makes 
 or orders you to make 
 any corrections or 
 modifications to the proposed statement, the 
 corrected or modified statement will be sent to 
 you, the prosecuting attorney
 , and any other party 
 for your review. If you disagree with anything
 in 
 the judge™s statement, you will have 10 day
 s from 
 the date the statement is sent you to serve and file 
 objections to the statement. 
 The judge then 
 reviews any
 objections, makes any additional 
 corrections to the statement, and certifies the 
 
 statement as
 a complete and accurate summary of 
 the 
 relevan
 t testimony and other evidence
 . Sending 
 the 
 statement to appellate division: 
 Once
 the trial court judge certifies 
 the statement on 
 appeal, the trial court clerk will send the statement 
 
 to the appellate divis
 ion along with the clerk™s 
 transcript. 
 Yes. There are two other parts of the official record that 
 need to be sent to the appellate division: 
 Documents fi
 led 
 in the
 trial court: 
 The trial court 
 clerk is responsible for preparing a record of the
 written documents filed in your case, called a 
 ﬁclerk™s transcript, ﬂ and sending this to the appellate 
 division. 
 (The documents the clerk must include in 
 this trans
 cript are listed in rule 8. 861 of the 
 California Rules of Court. 
 You can get a copy of this 
 rule at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. cou
 rts. ca. gov/rules
 . htm. 
 ) Exhibits submitted during trial: 
 Exhibits, such as 
 photographs, that were a
 dmitted in evidence, 
 refused, or lodged (temporarily placed with the 
 
 court) in the trial court
 are considered part of the 
 record on appeal. I
 f you want the appellate division 
 to consider such an exhibit, 
 however, 
 you must ask 
 the trial court clerk to send 
 the original exhibit to the 
 appellate division within 10 days after the la
 st respondent™s brie
 f is filed in the appellate division. 
 (See rule
 8. 870 of the California Rules of Court for 
 more information about this procedure. 
 You can get 
 a copy of this rule 
 at any courthouse or county law 
 library or online at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/rules
 . ) Sometimes, the
 trial court returns an exhibit to a 
 party at t
 he end of the trial. If the trial court returned 
 an exhibit to you or another party and you or the 
 other party ask 
 for the exhibit to be sent to the 
 appellate division, the party who has the exhibit 
 must deliv
 er that exhibit to the appellate division as 
 soon as possible. 
 Is there any other part of the record 
 that needs to be sent
 to the appellate 
 division?

 As soon as the record of the oral proceeding is ready, the 
 clerk of the trial court will s
 end it to the appellate 
 division along with the clerk™s transcript. When the 
 appellate divisio
 n receives this record, it will send you a 
 notice telling you when you must file your brief in the 
 appellate division. 
 A brief is a party™s written descript
 ion of the facts in the 
 case, the law that applies, and the party™s argument about 
 the issues 
 being appealed. If you are represented by a 
 law
 yer in your appeal, your lawyer will prepare your 
 brief. If 
 the appellate division has 
 permitted you 
 to 
 represent y
 ourself
 , you will have to prepare your brief 
 yourself. 
 You should read rules 8. 880
 Œ8. 891 of th
 e California Rules of Court, which set out 
 the 
 requirements for preparing, 
 serving, and filing briefs in 
 misdemeanor appeals, including requirements for the 
 
 forma
 t and length of those briefs. You can get copies of 
 the
 se rules at any courthouse or county la
 w library or 
 online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/rules
 . htm. 
 Contents: 
 If you are the appellant (the 
 party who is
 appealing) , your brief, called the ﬁappellant™s opening 
 brief, ﬂ must clearly explain what you believe are the 
 legal errors made in the trial court. Yo
 ur brief must refer 
 to the exact places in the 
 clerk™s transcript and the 
 reporter™s transcript (or other record of the oral 
 proceedings) that support your argume
 nt. Remember 
 that an appeal 
 is not a new trial. T
 he appellate division 
 will not consider new e
 vidence, such as the testimony of 
 new witnesses
 or new exhibits, so do not include any 
 new evidence in your brief. 
 Serving and filing: 
 You must serve and file yo
 ur brief in 
 the appellate division by the deadline the court set in the 
 notice it sent you, wh
 ich is 
 usually
 30 days after the 
 record is file
 d in the appellate division. ﬁServe and fileﬂ 
 means that
 you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a pa
 rty 
 to the case
 Šso not you
 Šmail or deliver (ﬁserveﬂ) 
 the brief to the respondent (the prosecut
 ing agency) 
 and any other party
 in the way requ
 ired by law
 . Make a record that the brief has been served. This 
 record is called a ﬁ
 proof of service. ﬂ 
 Proof of 
 Service 
 (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP
 -109) can be used to 
 make this record. 
 The proof of se
 rvice must show 
 who served the brief, who was s
 erv
 ed with the brief, 
 how the brief was served (by mail or in person) , and 
 
 the date the brief was served. 
 File the
 original brief and the proof of service with 
 the appellate division. You should make a copy 
 of 
 the brief you are planning to file for your 
 own
 records before you file it with the court. It is a good 
 idea to bring or mail an extra copy of the brief to the 
 
 clerk when you file your original and ask the clerk to 
 stamp this copy to show that the origi
 nal has been 
 filed.

 papers and proof of service

 . 
 If you do not file your brief by the deadline set by
 the 
 appellate division, the court may dismiss 
 your appeal. 
 Within 30 days after you serve and file your brief, the 
 respondent (the prosecuting agency) may, 
 but is not 
 required to, respond by 
 serving and 
 filing a respondent™s 
 brief. If the respondent
 does not file a brief, the appellant 
 does not 
 aut
 omatically win the appeal. The court will 
 decide the appeal on the record, the appellant™s brief, and 
 any oral ar
 gument by the appellant. 
 If the respondent 
 serves and 
 files a brief
 , within 20 days 
 after th
 e respondent™s brief was 
 served
 , you may, but a
 re 
 not required to, 
 serve and 
 file another brief replying to 
 the respondent™s brief. This is called a ﬁreply brief. 
 ﬂ Once all the briefs have been

 consider
 . If your 
 case presents no arguable issues, the 
 court will not hold oral argument. 
 ﬁOral argumentﬂ 
 is the parties™
 chance to explain their 
 argumen
 ts to the appellate division judges in person. 
 You do not have to participate in oral argument if you do 
 
 not want 
 to; you can notify the appellate division that 
 you want to ﬁwaiveﬂ 
 (give up) 
 oral argument
 by s
 erving 
 and filing a notice within 7 days after
 the notice of oral 
 argument was sent by the court. You can use 
 Notice of 
 Waiver of Oral Argument
 (Misdemeanor) 
 (form 
 CR 138) to waive oral argument
 . If all parties waive oral argument, 
 and the appellate 
 division approves the waiver and takes the oral a
 rgument 
 off calendar, 
 the judges will decide your appeal based on 
 the briefs and the record that were submitted. 
 But if one 
 party waives oral argument and another party or parties 
 
 do not, the appellate divisi
 on will hold oral argument 
 with 
 any party or pa
 rties who choose to participate, 
 including any party who asked to waive oral argument
 . If you choose to particip
 ate in oral argument, 
 each party 
 will have up to 10 minutes for argument, unless the court 
 
 orde
 rs otherwise. 
 If the appellate division has 
 per
 mitted 
 you to represent yourself, r
 emember that the judges will 
 already have read the 
 briefs
 , so you do not need t
 o read 
 your brief to the judges. It is more helpful to tell the 
 judges what you think is 
 most 
 important in your appeal 
 or ask the judges if th
 ey have any questions you could 
 answer. 
 
 
 After the oral argument
 is held (or 
 all parties waive oral 
 argument 
 and the court approves the waiver
 ) , the judges 
 of the appellate division will make a decision a
 bout your 
 appeal. 
 The appellate division has 90
 days after oral 
 argument
 (or 
 the date its waiver was approved) 
 to decide 
 the appeal. 
 The clerk of the court will 
 mail you a notice 
 of that decision. 
 If you decide you do not want to continue with your 
 appeal, you must file a written document with th
 e appellate division notifying it that you are giving up (
 this 
 is called 
 ﬁabandoningﬂ) 
 your
 appeal. You can use 
 Aban
 donment of Appeal (Misdemeanor) 
 (form CR
 -137) 
 to file this notice in a misdemeanor case. You 
 can get 
 form CR
 -137 at any courthouse or county
 law library or 
 online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/forms
 . htm. 
 
 If you decide not to continue your appeal and it is 
 dismiss
 ed, you will (with only very rare exceptions) 
 permanently give up the chance to raise any obj
 ections 
 to your conviction, sen
 tence, or other 
 mat
 ter that you
 could have raised on the appeal. If you were released 
 from custody with or without bail or your sent
 ence or 
 any probation conditions were stayed during the appeal, 
 
 you may be required to start 
 serving your sentence or 
 complying with your pr
 obation conditions immediately 
 after your appeal is dismissed.
