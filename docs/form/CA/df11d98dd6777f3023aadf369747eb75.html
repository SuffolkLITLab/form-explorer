EMPLOYER'S INSTRUCTIONS 
(EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS FOR SUPPORT)

WG-004

The instructions apply only to Earnings Withholding Orders for 
Support.    Applicable  instructions  appear  on  the  reverse  of  the 
other types of Earnings Withholding Orders.

The  instructions  in  paragraph  1  on  the  reverse  of  this  form 
describe your early duties to provide information to your em-
ployee and the levying officer.

Your  other  duties  are  TO  WITHHOLD  THE  CORRECT 
AMOUNT OF EARNINGS (if any) and PAY IT TO THE LEVY-
ING OFFICER during the withholding period.

The  usual  withholding  period  begins  ten  (10)  calendar  days 
after you receive the Earnings Withholding Order. In the case of 
an  Earnings  Withholding  Order  for  Support  (this  Order)  the 
withholding  period  continues  until  one  of  two  things  happens: 
(1)  the  total  amount  specified  in  the  Order,  plus  any  amounts 
listed in a notice from the  levying officer,  has been withheld,or 
(2)  you  receive  a  court  order  or  notice  signed  by  the  levying 
officer specifying a termination date.

You  are  entitled  to  rely  on  and  should  obey  all  written  notices 
signed by the levying officer.

The  form  Employer's  Return  describes  several  situations  that 
could affect the withholding period for this order. If you receive 
more 
than  one  Earnings  Withholding  Order  during  a 
withholding  period,  review  that  form  (Employer's  Return)  for 
instructions.

Your  duty  to  withhold  does  not  end  merely  because  the 
employee  no  longer  works  for  you.  Withholding  for  an  Earn- 
ings  Withholding  Order  for  Support  does  not  automatically 
terminate until one year after the employment of the employee 
by the employer ends.

                       WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY 
The  amounts  withheld  during  the  withholding  period  must  be 
paid  to  the  levying  officer  by  the  15th  of  the  next  month  after 
each payday. If you wish to pay more frequently than monthly, 
each  payment  must  be  made  within  ten  (10)  days  after  the 
close of the pay period.

Be sure to mark each check with the case number, the levying 
officer's  file  number,  if  different,  and  the  employee's  name  so 
the money will be applied to the correct account

                WHAT IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS? 
The  garnishment  law  is  contained  in  the  Code  of  Civil 
Procedure beginning with section 706.010. Sections 706.022,     
706.025, and 706.104 explain the employer's duties.

The Federal Wage Garnishment Law and federal rules provide 
the basic protections on which the California law is based.

Inquiries    about    the    federal    law    will    be    answered    by  mail,  
telephone  or  personal  interview  at  any  office  of  the Wage  
and  Hour  Division  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor. Offices  
are    listed    in    the    telephone    directory    under    the    U.S. 
Department of Labor in the U.S. Government listing.

                       COMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS
State  and  federal  law  limits  the  amount  of  earnings  that  can  be 
the  employee's 
limitations  are  based  on 
withheld.  The 
disposable  earnings,  which  are  different  from  gross  pay  or 
take-home pay.
To  determine  the  CORRECT  AMOUNT  OF  EARNINGS  TO  BE 
WITHHELD (if any), compute the employee's disposable
earnings.
          (A)  Earnings  include  any  money,  (whether  called  wages, 
salary,  commissions,  bonuses  or  anything  else)  that  is  paid  by 
an  employer  to  an  employee  for  personal  services.  Vacation  or 
sick  pay  is  subject  to  withholding  as  it  is  received  by  the 
employee. Tips are generally not included as earning since they 
are not paid by the employer.

     (B) Disposable earnings are the earnings left after subtracting 
the  part  of  the  earnings  a  state  or  federal  law  requires  an 
employer to withhold. Generally these required deductions are (1) 
federal  income  tax,  (2)  federal  social  security,  (3)  state  income 
tax,  (4)  state  disability  insurance,  and  (5)  payments  to  public 
employees'  retirement  systems.  Disposable  earnings  will  change 
when the required deductions change.

After  the  employee's  disposable  earnings  are  known,  WITH- 
HOLD FIFTY (50) PERCENT of the disposable earnings for the 
Withholding Order for Support. For example, if the employee has 
monthly  disposable  earnings  of  $1,432,  the  sum  of  $716  would 
be withheld to pay to the levying officer on account of this order.

Occasionally,  the  employee's  earnings  will  also  be  subject  to  a 
Wage  and  Earnings  Assignment  Order,  an  order  available  for 
child  support  or  spousal  support.  The  amount  required  to  be 
withheld for that order should be deducted from the amount to be 
withheld for this order. For example, if the employee is subject to 
a  Wage  and  Earnings  Assignment  Order  and  the  employer  is 
required to withhold $300 per month to pay on that order, when 
the  employer  receives  this  Earnings  Withholding  Order  for 
Support, the employer should deduct the $300 for the Wage and 
Earnings Assignment Order from the $716 and pay the balance 
to the levying officer each month for this order.

IMPORTANT WARNINGS

1.   IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO FIRE THE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS FOR THE 
      PAYMENT OF ONLY ONE INDEBTEDNESS. No matter how many orders you receive, so long as they all relate
      to judgment (no matter how many debts are represented in that judgment) the employee may not be fired.

2.   IT IS ILLEGAL TO AVOID AN EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER BY POSTPONING OR ADVANCING THE   
      PAYMENT OF EARNINGS. The employee's pay period must not be changed to prevent the order from taking effect.

3.   IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO PAY AMOUNTS WITHHELD FOR THE EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER TO THE LEVYING
      OFFICER. Your duty is to pay the money to the levying officer who will pay the money in accordance with the laws that
      apply to this case.

IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THESE LAWS, YOU MAY BE HELD LIABLE TO PAY CIVIL DAMAGES AND YOU MAY BE 
SUBJECT  TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION!
