 must make a report about your eligibility to return 
 to foster care. If you ask for it on the form JV 466, the court can 
 also send a notice to your parents or former legal

 decide your case. What happens at the hearing? If the court decides you meet the requirements, you will be 
 allowed to return to foster care. You will also have to go 
 back to court within 6 months to tell the court how you are 
 doing. Your lawyer will also go with you to that hearing. If

 case was closed will decide if your court case should be 
 reopened. Who will decide if I can return to juvenile 
 court jurisdiction and foster care? You do not qualify because of your age. If this happens, you cannot file another request. The judge can decide that: The information you gave to the court shows that 
 you do not meet one of the eligibility requirements or 
 the court needs more information to decide your case. 
 If this happens, the court will deny your request and 
 send you a letter explaining why your request was 
 denied. The court will also send you a list of lawyers 
 who can help you with your case. You can file 
 another request that includes the information that was 
 missing. The court has enough information to decide your case and wants you to come to a court hearing. If this happens, you will get a notice telling you the date, time, and place of your hearing. The court will 
 also assign a lawyer to speak for you at the hearing. ŁŁŁIf you used to be a ward, you will be under the juvenile court™s transition jurisdiction. When will the hearing happen? If you filed your court papers yourself and the court decides 
 there is enough information to decide your case, the hearing 
 will happen about three weeks after you filed your court 
 papers. If you asked a social worker or probation officer to file your court papers and the court decides there is enough 
 information to decide your case, the hearing will happen 
 about six weeks after you ask the social worker or probation 
 officer to file your court papers. How to Ask to Return to Juvenile Court
