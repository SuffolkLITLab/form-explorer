How to Ask to Return to Juvenile Court  
Jurisdiction and Foster Care

Who will decide if I can return to juvenile  
court jurisdiction and foster care?
A judge with the court in the county where your court  
case was closed will decide if your court case should be  
reopened. 

When will the hearing happen?
If you filed your court papers yourself and the court decides 
there is enough information to decide your case, the hearing 
will happen about three weeks after you filed your court  
papers.  

If you asked a social worker or probation officer to file your 
court papers and the court decides there is enough  
information to decide your case, the hearing will happen  
about six weeks after you ask the social worker or probation 
officer to file your court papers.  

What happens at the hearing?

At your hearing, the judge will review the evidence and  
decide your case.

If the court decides you meet the requirements, you will be  
allowed to return to foster care. You will also have to go  
back to court within 6 months to tell the court how you are  
doing. Your lawyer will also go with you to that hearing. If 
you used to be a dependent, you will be under the juvenile  
court’s dependency jurisdiction.

If you used to be a ward, you will be under the juvenile  
court’s transition jurisdiction.  

If the court denies your request, you can file another request 
later if your situation changes so that you meet the  
requirements.

The judge can decide that:

•

•

•

You do not qualify because of your age. If this  
happens, you cannot file another request.

The information you gave to the court shows that 
you do not meet one of the eligibility requirements or 
the court needs more information to decide your case. 
If this happens, the court will deny your request and 
send you a letter explaining why your request was 
denied. The court will also send you a list of lawyers 
who can help you with your case. You can file 
another request that includes the information that was 
missing.

The court has enough information to decide your  
case and wants you to come to a court hearing. If  
this happens, you will get a notice telling you the  
date, time, and place of your hearing. The court will 
also assign a lawyer to speak for you at the hearing.

The court will send a copy of the notice and your  
papers to:

– The lawyer assigned to your case, and

– The office that supervised you when the juvenile  
court’s jurisdiction was dismissed. That office  
must make a report about your eligibility to return  
to foster care.

If you ask for it on the form JV-466, the court can  
also send a notice to your parents or former legal  
guardian and the CASA office for your former  
CASA.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
