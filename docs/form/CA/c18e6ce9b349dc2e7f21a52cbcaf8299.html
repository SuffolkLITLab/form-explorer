 19. CASE NAME: 
 CASE NUMBER: 
 Page 4 of 4
 JV 567
 JV 567 [Rev. January 1, 2013] 
 The court makes these additional findings and orders under the ICPC and Regulation No. 7: 
 This court has jurisdiction over the child under articles 2, 3, 
 and 5 (a) of the ICPC to invoke the ICPC for the purpose of 
 requesting one or more home study assessments and expedited plac
 ement decisions on potential resource families living 
 in one or more receiving states. 
 a. 
 Under ICPC article 3 (d) , this court may place, or author
 ize the child welfare agency to place, the child in an 
 approved placement in a receiving state, in
 cluding a provisional placement as author
 ized by Regulation No. 7 of the ICPC, 
 only after receipt of written notification 
 from the receiving state t
 hat the proposed placement does 
 not appear to be contrary 
 to the interests of the child. 
 b. 
 If the child is placed in an approved plac
 ement in the receiving state, this court wil
 l retain jurisdiction over the child (und
 er ICPC article 5 (a) ) sufficient to determine 
 all matters related to the custody, supervi
 sion, care, and disposition of the child 
 that it would have had if the child had remained in California
 . This court will not terminate jurisdiction over the child or 
 terminate the supervisory responsibility of the child welf
 are agency having custody of 
 the child during the period of
 placement in the receiving state until 
 the child is adopted, reaches the age of ma
 jority, becomes self
 -supporting, or is 
 discharged with concurrence of the appropr
 iate authority in t
 he receiving state. 
 c. If the child is sent, or allowed to go, to a provisional placement
 in a receiving state, this court finds that any such placeme
 nt must be in compliance with ICPC Regulation No. 7, of which this 
 court takes judicial notice, including its purpose in defining 
 and regulating a provisional 
 placement under the ICPC. 
 h. Within two business days after receipt of a complete Regulati
 on No. 7 request, the county ICPC Liaison must transmit the 
 request for the home study assessment an
 d for any provisional placement to the 
 receiving state Compact Administrator. 
 The request must include a copy of this order. If the county IC
 PC Liaison finds that the ICPC 
 documentation is incomplete or 
 insufficient, it must request the necessar
 y information from the local sending agency. 
 f. If a provisional placement is 
 requested by California, 
 the receiving state must make a 
 determination to approve or deny 
 the request within seven calendar days of 
 receipt of the request packet. The pr
 ovisional approval or denial must be 
 communicated in writing by the receiv
 ing state's Compact Administrator to the California sending agency through 
 expedited means. 
 g The person designated in item 21 to receive communication mu
 st maintain contact with the California sending agency to 
 assist this court in determining 
 the status of the ICPC process 
 and must submit a status report
 in writing to the court, the 
 parties, and their counsel no later than 
 seven days before any scheduled court hear
 ing and also provide updates closer to 
 the hearing date should new developments 
 merit attention. The California send
 ing agency must cooperate with and work 
 with the above designated person and provide information and 
 assistance regarding the progre
 ss of the ICPC process for 
 the child. 
 i. The transmission of any documentat
 ion, request for information, or decision must
 be sent by overnigh
 t mail, by fax, or 
 as an e mail attachment, if approved by the receiving stat
 e, or by such other equally ex
 pedient method as may become 
 available. 
 j. This court expressly finds that its jurisdiction over the child 
 includes the power to effect the 
 return of the child to Califor
 nia 
 or transfer of the child to another location or custodian within fi
 ve business days of receipt of 
 written notification from the
 receiving state's Compact Administrator 
 that placement will not be approved or t
 hat previous placement approval has been 
 withdrawn by the receiving state. 
 In these circumstances, this 
 court order provides sufficient
 authority and di
 rection for the 
 sending agency to immediately re
 turn the child to California. 
 e. Date: JUDICIAL OFFICER
 Under article 5 (a) of the ICPC, the sending agency will cont
 inue to assume financial responsibility for the support and 
 maintenance of the child during the period 
 of the placement in 
 the receiving state.
