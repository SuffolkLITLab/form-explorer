24.

The court makes these additional findings and orders under the ICPC and Regulation No. 7:
a.  

This court has jurisdiction over the child under articles 2, 3, and 5(a) of the ICPC to invoke the ICPC for the purpose of 
requesting one or more home study assessments and expedited placement decisions on potential resource families living 
in one or more receiving states. 

b.  

c.  

d.  

e.  

f.

g

i.

Under ICPC article 3(d), this court may place, or authorize the child welfare agency to place, the child in an 
approved placement in a receiving state, including a provisional placement as authorized by Regulation No. 7 of the ICPC, 
only after receipt of written notification from the receiving state that the proposed placement does not appear to be contrary 
to the interests of the child. 

If the child is placed in an approved placement in the receiving state, this court will retain jurisdiction over the child (under 
ICPC article 5(a)) sufficient to determine all matters related to the custody, supervision, care, and disposition of the child 
that it would have had if the child had remained in California. This court will not terminate jurisdiction over the child or 
terminate the supervisory responsibility of the child welfare agency having custody of the child during the period of
placement in the receiving state until the child is adopted, reaches the age of majority, becomes self-supporting, or is 
discharged with concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state.

Under article 5(a) of the ICPC, the sending agency will continue to assume financial responsibility for the support and 
maintenance of the child during the period of the placement in the receiving state.

This court expressly finds that its jurisdiction over the child includes the power to effect the return of the child to California 
or transfer of the child to another location or custodian within five business days of receipt of written notification from the 
receiving state's Compact Administrator that placement will not be approved or that previous placement approval has been 
withdrawn by the receiving state. In these circumstances, this court order provides sufficient authority and direction for the 
sending agency to immediately return the child to California.

Within two business days after receipt of a complete Regulation No. 7 request, the county ICPC Liaison must transmit the 
request for the home study assessment and for any provisional placement to the receiving state Compact Administrator. 
The request must include a copy of this order. If the county ICPC Liaison finds that the ICPC documentation is incomplete or 
insufficient, it must request the necessary information from the local sending agency. 

If a provisional placement is requested by California, the receiving state must make a determination to approve or deny 
the request within seven calendar days of receipt of the request packet. The provisional approval or denial must be 
communicated in writing by the receiving state's Compact Administrator to the California sending agency through 
expedited means.

h.  

If the child is sent, or allowed to go, to a provisional placement in a receiving state, this court finds that any such placement 
must be in compliance with ICPC Regulation No. 7, of which this court takes judicial notice, including its purpose in defining 
and regulating a provisional placement under the ICPC. 

The person designated in item 21 to receive communication must maintain contact with the California sending agency to 
assist this court in determining the status of the ICPC process and must submit a status report in writing to the court, the 
parties, and their counsel no later than seven days before any scheduled court hearing and also provide updates closer to 
the hearing date should new developments merit attention. The California sending agency must cooperate with and work 
with the above-designated person and provide information and assistance regarding the progress of the ICPC process for 
the child. 

j.  

The transmission of any documentation, request for information, or decision must be sent by overnight mail, by fax, or 
as an e-mail attachment, if approved by the receiving state, or by such other equally expedient method as may become 
available.
