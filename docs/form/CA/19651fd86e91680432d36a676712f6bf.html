 A writ is an order from a higher court telling a lower 
 court to do something the law says the lower court must 
 do or not to do something the law says the lower court 
 
 does not have the power to do. In writ proceedings in the 
 appellate division, the lower court is the superior court 
 that took the action or issued the order being challenged. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In this information sheet, we call the lower court the 
 ﬁtrial court. ﬂ
 
 Yes. There are three main kinds of writs: 
 Writs of mandate (sometimes called ﬁmandamusﬂ) , 
 which are orders telling the trial court to do 
 something. 
 Writs of prohibition, which are orders telling the 
 trial court not to do something. 
 Writs of review (sometimes called ﬁcertiorariﬂ) , 
 which are orders telling the trial court that the 
 
 appellate division will review certain kinds of 
 actions already taken by the trial court. 
 There are laws (statutes) that you should read concerning 
 each type of writ: see California Code of Civil Procedure 
 sections 1084Œ1097 about writs of mandate, sections 
 
 1102Œ1105 about writs of prohibition, and sections 
 1067Œ1077 about writs of review. You can get copies of 
 these statutes at any county law library or online at

 No. In an 
 appeal, 
 the appellate division 
 must 
 consider 
 the parties™ arguments and decide whether the trial court 
 
 made the legal error claimed by the appealing party and 
 whether the trial court™s decision should be overturned 
 based on that error (this is called a ﬁdecision on the 
 meritsﬂ) . In a 
 writ proceeding, 
 the appellate division is 
 not required to make a decision on the merits; even if the 
 trial court made a legal error, the appellate division can 
 decide not to consider that error now, but to wait and 
 consider the error as part of any appeal from the final 
 judgment. Most requests for writs are denied without a 
 decision on the merits (this is called a ﬁsummary 
 
 denialﬂ) . Because of this, appeals are the ordinary way 
 that decisions made by a trial court are reviewed and 
 writ proceedings are often called proceedings for 
 ﬁextraordinaryﬂ relief. 
 Appeals and writ proceedings are also used to review 
 different kinds of decisions by the trial court. Appeals 
 can be used only to review a trial court™s final judgment 
 and a few kinds of orders. Most rulings made by a trial 
 court before it issues its final judgment cannot be 
 appealed right away; they can only be appealed after the 
 
 trial court case is over, as part of an appeal of the final 
 judgment. Unlike appeals, writ proceedings can be used 
 to ask for review of certain kinds of important rulings 
 made by a trial court before it issues its final judgment. 
 No. A writ proceeding is NOT a new trial
 . The 
 appellate division will not consider new evidence, such 
 as the testimony of new witnesses. Instead, if it does not 
 summarily deny the request for a writ, the appellate 
 division reviews a record of what happened in the trial 
 court and the trial court™s ruling to see if the trial court 
 made the legal error claimed by the person asking for the 
 writ. When it conducts its review, the appellate division 
 
 presumes that the trial court™s ruling is correct; the 
 person who requests the writ must show the appellate 
 division that the trial court made the legal error the 
 person is claiming. 
 
 No. 
 
 Writs can only address certain legal errors. 
 Writs can 
 only address the following types of legal errors made by 
 
 a trial court: 
 The trial court has a legal duty to act but: 
 o Refuses to act; 
 o Has not done what the law says it must do; or 
 o Has acted in a way the law says it does not have 
 the power to act. 
 The trial court has performed or says it is going to 
 perform a judicial function (like deciding a person™s 
 
 rights under law in a particular case) in a way that 
 the court does not have the legal power to do. 
 There must be no other adequate remedy. 
 The trial 
 court™s error must also be something that can be fixed 
 only with a writ. The person asking for the writ must 
 
 show the appellate division that there is no adequate way 
 to address the trial court™s error other than with the writ 
 (this is called having ﬁno adequate remedy at lawﬂ) . As 
 mentioned above, appeals are the ordinary way that trial 
 court decisions are reviewed. If the trial court™s ruling 
 can be appealed, the appellate division will generally 
 consider an appeal to be good enough (an ﬁadequate 
 remedyﬂ) unless the person asking for the writ can show 
 the appellate division that the person will be harmed in a 
 way that cannot be fixed by the appeal if the appellate 
 division does not issue the writ (this is called 
 
 ﬁirreparableﬂ injury or harm) . 
 Statutory writs: 
 There are laws (statutes) that provide 
 that certain kinds of rulings can or must be challenged 
 using a writ proceeding. These are called ﬁstatutory 
 writs. ﬂ Here is a list of some of the most common 
 rulings that a statute says can or must be challenged 
 using a writ: 
 A ruling on a motion to disqualify a judge (see 
 California Code of Civil Procedure section 170. 3 (d) ) 
 Denial of a motion for summary judgment (see 
 California Code of Civil Procedure section 
 437 c (m) (l) ) 
 A ruling on a motion for summary adjudication of 
 issues (see California Code of Civil Procedure 
 section 437 c (m) (l) ) 
 Is a writ proceeding the same as 
 an appeal? 
 Is a writ proceeding a new trial? 
 Can a writ be used to address 
 any 
 errors made by a trial court?

 Denial of a stay in an unlawful detainer matter (see 
 California Code of Civil Procedure section 1176)

 California Penal Code section 1424) 
 You can get copies of these statutes at any county law 
 library or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces 
 /codes. xhtml. 
 You will need to check whether there is a 
 statute providing that the specific ruling you want to 
 challenge can or must be reviewed using a writ 
 proceeding. (Note that just because there is a statute 
 requiring or allowing you to ask for a writ to challenge a 
 
 ruling does not mean that the court must grant your 
 request; the appellate division can still deny a request for 
 
 a statutory writ. ) 
 Common law writs: 
 Even if there is not a statute 
 specifically providing for a writ proceeding to challenge 
 
 a particular ruling, most trial court rulings other than the 
 final judgment can potentially be challenged using a writ 
 proceeding if the trial court made the type of legal error 
 described above and the petitioner has no other adequate 
 remedy at law. These writs are called ﬁcommon lawﬂ 
 writs. 
 No. Different courts have the power (called 
 ﬁjurisdictionﬂ) to consider requests for writs in different 
 types of cases. The appellate division can only consider 
 requests for writs in limited civil, misdemeanor, and 
 infraction cases, and certain small claims cases. A 
 limited civil case is a civil case in which the amount 
 
 claimed is $25, 000 or less (see California Code of Civil 
 Procedure sections 85 and 88) . Misdemeanor cases are 
 cases in which a person has been charged with or 
 convicted of a crime for which the punishment can 
 include jail time of up to one year but not time in state 
 
 prison (see California Penal Code sections 17 and 19. 2) . 
 (If the person was also charged with or convicted of a 
 felony in the same case, it is considered a felony case, 
 not a misdemeanor case. ) Infraction cases are cases in 
 which a person has been charged with or convicted of a 
 crime for which the punishment can be a fine, traffic 
 school, or some form of community service but cannot 
 
 include any time in jail or prison (see California Penal 
 Code sections 17 and 19. 8) . Examples of infractions 
 include traffic tickets or citations for violations of some 
 city or county ordinances. (If a person was also charged 
 with or convicted of a misdemeanor in the same case, it 
 is considered a misdemeanor case, not an infraction 
 case. ) You can get copies of these statutes at any county 
 law library or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces 
 /codes. xhtml. 
 The appellate division can consider 
 requests for writs in small claims actions relating to 
 postjudgment enforcement orders. 
 The appellate division does NOT have jurisdiction to 
 consider requests for writs in either unlimited civil cases 
 (civil cases in which the amount claimed is more than 
 
 $25, 000) or felony cases (cases in which a person has 
 been charged with or convicted of a crime for which the 
 punishment can include time in state prison) . Requests 
 for writs in these cases can be made in the Court of 
 Appeal. The appellate division also does NOT have 
 
 jurisdiction to consider requests for writs of habeas 
 corpus; requests for these writs can be made in the 
 
 superior court. 
 Requests for writs relating to actions of the small claims 
 division 
 other
 than postjudgment enforcement orders are 
 considered by a single judge in the appellate division. 
 (See form SC 300 INFO. ) Requests for writs relating to 
 
 superior court actions in small claims cases on appeal 
 may be made to the Court of Appeal. 
 If you are asking for the writ, you are called the 
 PETITIONER. You should read ﬁInformation for the 
 
 Petitioner, ﬂ beginning on page 4. 
 The court the petitioner is asking to be ordered to do or 
 not to do something is called the RESPONDENT. In 
 
 appellate division writ proceedings, the trial court is the 
 respondent. 
 Any other party in the trial court case who would be 
 affected by a ruling regarding the request for a writ is a 
 REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. If you are a real party in 
 
 interest, you should read ﬁInformation for a Real Party in 
 Interest, ﬂ beginning on page 10. 
 You do not 
 have to have a lawyer; you are allowed to

 division. But writ proceedings can be very complicated

 and you will have to follow the same rules that lawyers 
 have to follow. If you have any questions about the writ 
 procedures, you should talk to a lawyer. In limited civil 
 cases and infraction cases, you must hire a lawyer at 
 your own expense if you want one (the court cannot 
 provide one) . You can get information about finding a 
 
 lawyer on the California Courts Online Self Help Center 
 at www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp lowcosthelp. htm. 
 This part of the information sheet is written for the 
 petitionerŠthe party asking for the writ. It explains 
 
 some of the rules and procedures relating to asking for a 
 writ. The information may also be helpful to a real party 
 in interest. There is more information for a real party in 
 interest starting on page 10 of this information sheet. 
 Only a party in the trial court proceedingŠthe plaintiff 
 or defendant in a civil case or the defendant or 
 prosecuting agency in a misdemeanor or infraction 
 caseŠcan ask for a writ challenging a ruling on a 
 motion to disqualify a judge (see California Code of 
 
 Civil Procedure section 170. 3 (d) ) . Parties are also 
 usually the only ones that ask for writs challenging other 
 kinds of trial court rulings. However, in most cases, a 
 person who was not a party does have the legal right to 
 ask for a writ if that person has a ﬁbeneficial interestﬂ in 
 
 the trial court™s ruling. A ﬁbeneficial interestﬂ means that 
 the person has a specific right or interest affected by the 
 ruling that goes beyond the general rights or interests the 
 public may have in the ruling. 
 To ask for a writ you must serve and file a petition for a 
 writ (see below for an explanation of how to ﬁserve and 
 fileﬂ a petition) . A petition is a formal request that the 
 appellate division issue a writ. A petition for a writ 
 explains to the appellate division what happened in the 
 
 trial court, what legal error you (the petitioner) believe 
 the trial court made, why you have no other adequate 
 remedy at law, and what order you are requesting the 
 appellate division to make. 
 If you are represented by a 
 lawyer, your lawyer will 
 prepare your petition for a writ. If you are not 
 represented by a lawyer, you must use 
 Petition for Writ 
 (Misdemeanor, Infraction, or Limited Civil Case) 
 (form 
 APP 151) to prepare your petition. You can get form 
 APP 151 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/forms. 
 This form asks you 
 to fill in the information that needs to be in a writ 
 petition. 
 a. Description of your interest in the trial 
 court™s ruling 
 
 Your petition needs to tell the appellate division why 
 you have a right to ask for a writ in the case. As 
 discussed above, usually only a person who was a party 
 
 in the trial court caseŠthe plaintiff or defendant in a 
 civil case or the defendant or prosecuting agency in a 
 misdemeanor or infraction caseŠasks for a writ 
 challenging a ruling in that case. If you were a party in 
 the trial court case, say that in your petition. If you were 
 
 not a party, you will need to describe what ﬁbeneficial 
 interestﬂ you have in the trial court™s ruling. A 
 ﬁbeneficial interestﬂ means that you have a specific right 
 or interest affected by the ruling that goes beyond the 
 general rights or interests the public may have in the 
 
 ruling. To show the appellate division that you have a 
 beneficial interest in the ruling you want to challenge, 
 you must describe how the ruling will affect you in a 
 direct and negative way. 
 b. Description of the legal error you believe the 
 trial court made 
 Your petition will need to tell the appellate division what 
 legal error you believe the trial court made. Not every 
 mistake a trial court might make can be addressed by a 
 writ. You must show that the trial court made one of the 
 
 following types of legal errors: 
 The trial court has a legal duty to act but: 
 o Refuses to act; 
 o Has not done what the law says it must do; or 
 Who can ask for a writ? 
 How do I ask for a writ? 
 How do I prepare a writ petition?

 o Has acted in a way the law says it does not have 
 the power to act. 
 The trial court has performed or says it is going to 
 perform a judicial function (like deciding a person™s 
 rights under law in a particular case) in a way that 
 the court does not have the legal power to do. 
 To show the appellate division that the trial court made 
 one of these legal errors, you will need to: 
 Show that the trial court has the legal duty or the 
 power to act or not act in a particular way. You will 
 
 need to tell the appellate division what legal 
 authorityŠwhat constitutional provision, statute, 
 rule, or published court decisionŠestablishes the 
 trial court™s legal duty or power to act or not act in 
 
 that way. 
 Show the appellate division that the trial court has 
 not acted in the way that this legal authority says the 
 court is required to act. You will need to tell the 
 appellate division exactly where in the record of 
 what happened in the trial court it shows that the 
 trial court did not act in the way it was required to. 
 c. Description of why you need the writ 
 One of the most important parts of your petition is 
 explaining to the appellate division why you need the 
 writ you have requested. Remember, the appellate 
 division does not have to grant your petition just because 
 the trial court made an error. You must convince the 
 
 appellate division that it is important for it to issue the 
 writ. 
 Your petition needs to show that a writ is the only way 
 to fix the trial court™s error. 
 To convince the court you 
 need the writ, you will need to show the appellate 
 
 division that you have no way to fix the trial court™s 
 error other than through a writ (this is called having ﬁno 
 
 adequate remedy at lawﬂ) . 
 This will be hard if the trial court™s ruling can be 
 appealed. 
 If the ruling you are challenging can be 
 appealed, either immediately or as part of an appeal of 
 the final judgment in your case, the appellate division 
 will generally consider this appeal to be a good enough 
 way to fix the trial court™s ruling (an ﬁadequate 
 remedyﬂ) . To be able to explain to the appellate division 
 
 why you do not have an adequate remedy at law, you 
 will need to find out if the ruling you want to challenge 
 can be appealed, either immediately or as part of an 
 appeal of the final judgment. 
 Here are some trial court rulings that can be appealed. 
 There are laws (statutes) that say that certain kinds of 
 trial court rulings (ﬁordersﬂ) can be appealed 
 immediately. In limited civil cases, California Code of 
 
 Civil Procedure section 904. 2 lists orders that can be 
 appealed immediately, including orders: 
 Changing or refusing to change the place of trial 
 (venue) 
 Granting a motion to quash service of summons 
 Granting a motion to stay or dismiss the action on 
 the ground of inconvenient forum 
 Granting a new trial 
 Denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the 
 verdict 
 Granting or dissolving an injunction or refusing to 
 grant or dissolve an injunction 
 Appointing a receiver 
 Made after final judgment in the case 
 In misdemeanor and infraction cases, orders made after 
 the final judgment that affect the substantial rights of the 
 defendant can be appealed immediately (California 
 Penal Code section 1466) . 
 In misdemeanor cases, orders granting or denying a 
 motion to suppress evidence can also be appealed 
 immediately (California Penal Code section 1538. 5 (j) ) . 
 You can get copies of these statutes at any county law 
 library or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces 
 /codes. xhtml. 
 You should also check to see if there are 
 published court decisions that indicate whether you can 
 or must use an appeal or a writ petition to challenge the 
 
 type of ruling you want to challenge in your case. 
 If the ruling can be appealed, you will need to show 
 that an appeal will not fix the trial court™s error. 
 If the 
 trial court ruling you want to challenge can be appealed, 
 you will need to show the appellate division why that 
 appeal is not good enough to fix the trial court™s error. 
 
 To do that, you will need to show the appellate division

 the time it takes for an appeal, the harm you want to 
 prevent may happen before an appeal can be finished. 
 d. Description of the order you want the 
 appellate division to make 
 Your petition needs to describe what you are asking the 
 appellate division to order the trial court to do or not do. 
 
 Writ petitions usually ask that the trial court be ordered 
 to cancel (ﬁvacateﬂ) its ruling, issue a new ruling, or not 
 
 take any steps to enforce its ruling. 
 If you want the appellate division to order the trial court 
 not to do anything more until the appellate division 
 
 decides whether to grant the writ you are requesting, you 
 must ask for a ﬁstay. ﬂ If you want a stay, you should first 
 ask the trial court for a stay. You should tell the 
 appellate division whether you asked the trial court for a 
 stay. If you did not ask the trial court for a stay, you 
 
 should tell the appellate division why you did not do 
 this. 
 If you ask the appellate division for a stay, make sure 
 you also fill out the ﬁStay requestedﬂ box on the first 
 page of the 
 Petition for Writ (Misdemeanor, Infraction, 
 or Limited Civil Case) 
 (form APP 151) . 
 e. Verifying the petition 
 Petitions for writs must be ﬁverified. ﬂ This means that 
 either the petitioner or the petitioner™s attorney must 
 declare under penalty of perjury that the facts stated in 
 the petition are true and correct, must sign the petition, 
 and must indicate the date that the petition was signed. 
 
 On the last page of the
 Petition for Writ (Misdemeanor, 
 Infraction, or Limited Civil Case) 
 (form APP 151) , there 
 is a place for you to verify your petition. 
 
 Yes. Along with the petition, you must serve and file a 
 record of what happened in the trial court (see below for 
 an explanation of how to serve and file the petition) . 
 
 Since the appellate division judges were not there in the 
 trial court, a record of what happened must be sent to the 
 appellate division for its review. The materials that make 
 up this record are called ﬁsupporting documents. ﬂ 
 What needs to be in the supporting documents. 
 The 
 supporting documents must include: 
 A record of what was said in the trial court about the 
 ruling that you are challenging (this is called the 
 ﬁoral proceedingsﬂ) and 
 Copies of certain important documents from the trial 
 court. 
 Read below for more information about these two parts 
 of the supporting documents. 
 Record of the oral proceedings. 
 There are several ways 
 a record of what was said in the trial court may be 
 provided to the appellate division: 
 A transcript
 ŠA transcript is a written record (often 
 called the ﬁverbatimﬂ record) of the oral proceedings 
 in the trial court. If a court reporter was in the trial 
 court and made a record of the oral proceedings, you 
 can have the court reporter prepare a transcript of 
 those oral proceedings, called a ﬁreporter™s 
 
 transcript, ﬂ for the appellate division. If a reporter 
 was not there, but the oral proceedings were 
 officially recorded on approved electronic recording 
 equipment, you can have a transcript prepared for 
 the appellate division from the official electronic 
 recording of these proceedings. You (the petitioner) 
 must pay for preparing a transcript, unless the court 
 orders otherwise. 
 A copy of an electronic recording
 ŠIf the oral 
 proceedings were officially recorded on approved 
 electronic recording equipment, the court has a local 
 rule for the appellate division permitting this 
 
 recording to be used as the record of the oral 
 proceedings, and all the parties agree (ﬁstipulateﬂ) , a 
 copy of the official electronic recording itself can be 
 used as the record of the oral proceedings instead of 
 a transcript. You (the petitioner) must pay for 
 
 preparing a copy of the official electronic recording, 
 unless the court orders otherwise. 
 A summary
 ŠIf a transcript or official electronic 
 recording of what was said in the trial court is not 
 available, your petition must include a declaration (a 
 
 statement signed by the petitioner under penalty of 
 perjury) either: 
 o Explaining why the transcript or official 
 electronic recording is not available and 
 providing a fair summary of the proceedings, 
 
 including the petitioner™s arguments and any 
 statement by the court supporting its ruling; or 
 Is there anything else that I need to 
 serve and file with my petition?

 Copies of documents from the trial court. 
 Copies of the 
 following documents from the trial court must also be 
 included in the supporting documents: 
 The trial court ruling being challenged in the petition 
 All documents and exhibits submitted to the trial 
 court supporting and opposing the petitioner™s 
 
 position 
 Any other documents or portions of documents 
 submitted to the trial court that are necessary for a 
 complete understanding of the case and of the ruling 
 being challenged 
 What if I cannot get copies of the documents from the 
 trial court because of an emergency? 
 Rule 8. 931 of the 
 California Rules of Court provides that in extraordinary 
 circumstances the petition may 
 be filed without copies of 
 the documents from the trial court. If the petition is filed 
 without these documents, you must explain in your 
 petition the urgency and the circumstances making the 
 
 documents available. 
 Format of the supporting documents
 . Supporting 
 documents must be put in the format required by rule 
 8. 931 of the California Rules of Court. Among other 
 things, there must be a tab for each document and an 
 index listing the documents that are included. You 
 should carefully read rule 8. 931. You can get a copy of 
 
 rule 8. 931 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/rules. 
 Yes. For statutory writs, the statute usually sets the 
 deadline for serving and filing the petition. Here is a list 
 
 of the deadlines for filing petitions for some of the most 
 common statutory writs (you can get copies of these 
 statutes at any county law library or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces/codes. xhtml
 ) . 
 
 Statutory Writ 
 Filing Deadline 
 Writ challenging a ruling on a 
 motion to disqualify a judge 
 (see California Code of Civil 
 
 Procedure section 170. 3 (d) ) 
 10 days after notice 
 to the parties of the 
 decision 
 Writ challenging the denial of 
 a motion for summary 
 judgment (see California 
 Code of Civil Procedure 
 section 437 c (m) (l) ) 
 20 days after service 
 of written notice of 
 entry of the order 
 Writ challenging a ruling on a 
 motion for summary 
 adjudication of issues (see 
 California Code of Civil 
 Procedure section 437 c (m) (l) ) 
 20 days after service 
 of written notice of 
 entry of the order 
 For common law writs or statutory writs where the 
 statute does not set a deadline, you should file the 
 
 petition as soon as possible and not later than 30 days 
 after the court makes the ruling that you are challenging 
 in the petition. While there is no absolute deadline for 
 filing these petitions, writ petitions are usually used 
 when it is urgent that the trial court™s error be fixed. 
 Remember, the court is not required to grant your 
 petition even if the trial court made an error. If you delay 
 
 in filing your petition, it may make the appellate division 
 think that it is not really urgent that the trial court™s error 
 be fixed and the appellate division may deny your 
 petition. If there are extraordinary circumstances that 
 delayed the filing of your petition, you should explain 
 
 these circumstances to the appellate division in your 
 petition. 
 Rule 8. 931 (d) requires that the petition and one set of 
 
 supporting documents be served on any named real party 
 in interest and that just the petition be served on the 
 respondent trial court. ﬁServingﬂ a petition on a party 
 means that you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old mail, deliver, or 
 electronically send (ﬁserveﬂ) the petition to the real 
 party in interest and the respondent court in the way 
 required by law. If the petition is mailed or

 Make a record that the petition has been served. 
 This record is called a ﬁproof of service. ﬂ 
 Proof of 
 Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109) or 
 Proof of Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109 E) can be used to make this record. 
 The proof of service must show who served the 
 petition, who was served with the petition, how the 
 petition was served (by mail, in person, or 
 
 electronically) , and the date the petition was served. 
 You can get more information about how to serve court 
 documents and proof of service from

 Service? 
 (form APP 109 INFO) and on the California 
 Courts Online Self
 -Help Center at

 To file a petition for a writ in the appellate division, you 
 must bring or mail the original petition, including the 
 supporting documents, and the proof of service to the 
 clerk for the appellate division of the superior court that 
 made the ruling you are challenging. If the superior court 
 has more than one courthouse location, you should call 
 
 the clerk at the courthouse where the ruling you are 
 challenging was made to ask where to file your petition. 
 You should make a copy of all the documents you are 
 planning to file for your own records before you file 
 them with the court. It is a good idea to bring or mail an 
 
 extra copy of the petition to the clerk when you file your 
 original and ask the clerk to stamp this copy to show that 
 
 the original has been filed. 
 There is no fee to file a petition for a writ in a 
 misdemeanor or infraction case, but there is a fee to file 
 a petition for a writ in a limited civil case. You should 
 ask the clerk for the appellate division where you are 
 filing the petition what this fee is. If you cannot afford to 
 
 pay this filing fee, you can ask the court to waive this 
 fee. To do this, you must fill out a 
 Request to Waive 
 Court Fees 
 (form FW 001) . You can get form FW 001 
 at any courthouse or county law library or online at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/forms. 
 You can file this application 
 either before you file your petition or with your petition. 
 The court will review this application and decide 
 whether to waive the filing fee. 
 
 Within 10 days after you serve and file your petition, the 
 
 respondent or any real party in interest can serve and file 
 preliminary opposition to the petition. Within 10 days 
 after an opposition is filed, you may serve and file a 
 reply to that opposition. 
 The appellate division does not have to wait for an 
 opposition or reply before it can act on a petition for a 
 writ, however. Without waiting, the appellate division 
 
 can: 
 a. Issue a stay 
 b. Summarily deny the petition 
 c. Issue an alternative writ or order to show cause 
 
 d. Notify the parties that it is considering issuing a 
 preemptory writ in the first instance 
 e. Issue a peremptory writ in the first instance if such 
 relief was expressly requested in the petition. 
 Read below for more information about these options. 
 a. Stay of trial court proceedings 
 A stay is an order from the appellate division telling the 
 trial court not to do anything more until the appellate 
 division decides whether to grant your petition. A stay 
 puts the trial court proceedings on temporary hold. 
 b. Summary denial 
 A ﬁsummary denialﬂ means that the appellate division 
 denies the petition without deciding whether the trial 
 court made the legal error claimed by the petitioner or 
 whether the writ requested by the petitioner should be 
 issued based on that error. Remember, even if the trial 
 
 court made a legal error, the appellate division can 
 decide not to consider that error now but to wait and 
 consider the error as part of any appeal from the final 
 judgment. No reasons need to be given for a summary 
 
 denial. Most petitions for writs are denied in this way.

 c. Alternative writ or order to show cause 
 An ﬁalternative writﬂ is an order telling the trial court 
 either to do what the petitioner has requested in the 
 petition (or some modified form of what the petitioner 
 requested) or to show the appellate division why the trial 
 court should not be ordered to do what the petitioner 
 
 requested. An ﬁorder to show causeﬂ is similar; it is an 
 order telling the trial court to show the appellate division 
 why the trial court should not be ordered to do what the 
 petitioner requested in the petition (or some modified 
 form of what the petitioner requested) . The appellate 
 
 division will issue an alternative writ or an order to show 
 cause only if the petitioner has shown that the petitioner 
 has no adequate remedy at law and the appellate division 
 has decided that the petitioner may have shown that the 
 
 trial court made a legal error that needs to be fixed. 
 If the appellate division issues an alternative writ and the 
 trial court does what the petitioner requested (or a 
 modified form of what the petitioner requested as 
 ordered by the appellate division) , then no further action 
 by the appellate division is needed and the appellate 
 division may dismiss the petition. 
 If the trial court does not comply with an alternative 
 writ, however, or if the appellate division issues an order 
 to show cause, then the respondent court or a real party 
 in interest can file a response to the appellate division™s 
 order (called a ﬁreturnﬂ) that explains why the trial court 
 should not be ordered to do what the petitioner 
 
 requested. The return must be served and filed within the 
 time specified by the appellate division or, if no time is 
 specified, within 30 days from the date the alternative 
 writ or order to show cause was issued. The petitioner 
 will then have an opportunity to serve and file a reply 
 
 within 15 days after the return is filed. The appellate 
 division may set the matter for oral argument. When all 
 the papers have been served and filed (or the time to 
 serve and file them has passed) and oral argument is 
 
 completed, the appellate division will decide the case. 
 d. Peremptory writ in
 the first instance 
 A ﬁperemptory writ in the first instanceﬂ is an order 
 telling the trial court to do what the petitioner has 
 requested (or some modified form of what the petitioner 
 requested) that is issued without the appellate division 
 
 first issuing an alternative writ or order to show cause. It 
 is very rare for the appellate division to issue a 
 peremptory writ in the first instance, and it will not do so 
 unless the respondent and real parties in interest have 
 received notice that the court might do so, either through 
 the petitioner expressly asking for such relief in the 
 petition, or by the court first notifying the parties and 
 giving the respondent court and any real party in interest 
 
 a chance to file an opposition. 
 The respondent court or a real party in interest can file a 
 response to the appellate division™s notice (called an 
 ﬁoppositionﬂ) that explains why the trial court should not 
 be ordered to do what the petitioner has requested. The 
 opposition must be served and filed within the time 
 
 specified by the appellate division or, if no time is 
 specified, within 30 days from the date the notice was 
 issued. The petitioner will then have a chance to serve 
 and file a reply within 15 days after the opposition is 
 filed. The appellate division may then set the matter for 
 
 oral argument. When all the papers have been served and 
 filed (or the time to serve and file them has passed) and 
 oral argument is completed, the appellate division will 
 decide the case. 
 
 If the court denies your petition, it may be helpful to talk 
 to a lawyer. In a limited civil or infraction case, you 
 must hire a lawyer at your 
 own expense if you want one 
 (the court cannot provide one) . You can get information

 You do not 
 have 
 to do anything. The California Rules of 
 Court give you the right to file a preliminary opposition 
 to a petition for a writ within 10 days after the petition is 
 served and filed, but you are not required to do this. The 
 appellate division can take certain actions without 
 
 waiting for any opposition, including: 
 Summarily denying the petition; 
 Issuing an alternative writ or order to show cause; 
 Notifying the parties that it is considering issuing a 
 peremptory writ in the first instance; or 
 Issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance if such 
 relief was expressly requested in the petition. 
 Read the response to question for more information 
 about these options. 
 Most petitions for writs are summarily denied, often 
 within a few days after they are filed. If you have not 
 
 already received something from the appellate division 
 saying what action it is taking on the petition, it is a 
 good idea to call the appellate division to see if the 
 petition has been denied before you decide whether and 
 
 how to respond. 
 This would be a good time to talk to a lawyer. You do 
 not have
 to have a lawyer; you are allowed to represent 
 yourself in a writ proceeding in the appellate division. 
 But writ proceedings can be very complicated and you 
 will have to follow the same rules that lawyers have to 
 follow. If you have any questions about writ proceedings 
 or about whether and how you should respond to a writ 
 
 petition, you should talk to a lawyer. In a limited civil 
 case or infraction case, you must hire a lawyer at your 
 own expense if you want one (the court cannot provide 
 one) . You can get information about finding an attorney 
 on the California Courts Online Self Help Center at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp lowcosthelp. htm. 
 If the petition has not already been summarily denied, 
 you may, but are not required to, serve and file a 
 preliminary opposition to the petition within 10 days 
 after the petition was served and filed. In general, it is a 
 
 good idea to consider filing a preliminary opposition if 
 the petition misstates the facts or if you think the petition 
 shows that the trial court made a legal error that may 
 need to be fixed. However, the appellate division will 
 seldom grant a writ without first issuing an alternative 
 writ, an order to show cause, or a notice that it is 
 considering issuing a peremptory writ. In all these 
 circumstances, you will get notice from the court and 
 have a chance to file a response. Note that the appellate 
 
 division may issue a peremptory writ without notice if 
 the petitioner expressly asked the court, in the petition, 
 to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance. If the 
 petitioner did that, you may want to consider whether to 
 file a preliminary opposition, to explain why you believe 
 
 the small claims court made no legal error and why the 
 petitioner is not entitled to a writ. 
 If you decide to file a preliminary opposition, you must 
 serve that preliminary opposition on all the other parties 
 to the writ proceeding. ﬁServing and filingﬂ an 
 opposition means that you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old mail, deliver, or 
 electronically send (ﬁserveﬂ) the preliminary 
 opposition to the other parties in the way required by 
 law. If the preliminary opposition is mailed or 
 personally delivered, it must be by someone who is 
 
 not a party to the caseŠso not you. 
 Make a record that the preliminary opposition has 
 been served. This record is called a ﬁproof of 
 service
 . ﬂ Proof of Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form 
 APP 109) or 
 Proof of Electronic Service (Appellate 
 Division) 
 (form APP 109 E) can be used to make this 
 record. The proof of service must show who served 
 the preliminary opposition, who was served with the 
 preliminary opposition, how the preliminary 
 opposition was served (by mail, in person, or 
 electronically) , and the date the preliminary 
 opposition was served. 
 File the original preliminary opposition and the 
 proof of service with the appellate division. You 
 should make a copy of the preliminary opposition 
 for your own records before you file it with the 
 
 court. It is a good idea to bring or mail an extra copy 
 of the preliminary opposition to the clerk when you 
 file your original and ask the clerk to stamp this 
 copy to show that the original has been filed.

 Yes. Unless the trial court has already done what the 
 alternative writ told it to do, you should serve and file a 
 response called a ﬁreturn. ﬂ 
 As explained above, the appellate division will issue an 
 alternative writ or an order to show cause if the appellate 
 division has decided that the petitioner may have shown 
 that the trial court made a legal error that needs to be 
 fixed. An ﬁalternative writﬂ is an order telling the trial 
 court either to do what the petitioner has requested in the 
 
 petition (or some modified form of what the petitioner 
 requested) or to show the appellate division why the trial 
 court should not be ordered to do what the petitioner 
 requested. An ﬁorder to show causeﬂ is similar; it is an 
 order telling the trial court to show the appellate division 
 
 why the trial court should not be ordered to do what the 
 petitioner requested in the petition (or some modified 
 
 form of what the petitioner requested) . 
 If the appellate division issues an alternative writ and the 
 trial court does what the petitioner requested (or a 
 
 modified form of what the petitioner requested as 
 ordered by the appellate division) , then no further action 
 by the appellate division is needed and the appellate 
 division may dismiss the petition. If the trial court does 
 not comply with an alternative writ, however, or if the 
 appellate division issues an order to show cause, then the 
 respondent court or the real party in interest may serve 
 
 and file a response to the appellate division™s order, 
 called a ﬁreturn. ﬂ 
 A return is your argument to the appellate division about 
 why the trial court should not be ordered to do what the 
 petitioner has requested. If you are represented by a 
 
 lawyer in the writ proceeding
 , your lawyer will prepare 
 your return. If you are not represented by a lawyer, you 
 will need to prepare your own return. A return is usually 
 a legal response called an ﬁanswer. ﬂ An answer is used 
 to admit or deny the facts alleged in the petition, to add 
 
 to or correct the facts, and to explain any legal defenses 
 to the legal arguments made by the petitioner. You 
 should read California Code of Civil Procedure sections 
 430. 10Œ430. 80 for more information about answers. You 
 can get copies of these statutes at any county law library 
 or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces/codes. xhtml
 . A return can also include additional supporting 
 
 documents not already filed by the petitioner. 
 If you do not file a return when the appellate division 
 issues an alternative writ or order to show cause, it does 
 not mean that the appellate division is required to issue 
 the writ requested by the petitioner. However, the 
 appellate division will treat the facts stated by the 
 
 petitioner in the petition as true, which makes it more 
 likely the appellate division will issue the requested writ. 
 Unless the appellate division sets a different filing 
 deadline in its alternative writ or order to show cause, 
 you must serve and file your return within 30 days after 
 
 the appellate division issues the alternative writ or order 
 to show cause. The return must be served on all the other 
 parties to the writ proceeding. ﬁServing and filingﬂ the 
 return means that you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old mail, deliver, or 
 electronically send (ﬁserveﬂ) the return to the other 
 parties in the way required by law. If the return is 
 
 mailed or personally delivered, it must be by 
 someone who is not a party to the caseŠso not you. 
 Make a record that the return has been served. This 
 record is called a ﬁproof of service. ﬂ 
 Proof of Service

 (by mail, in person, or electronically) , and the date 
 the return
 was served. File the original return and the proof of service with 
 the appellate division. You should make a copy of

 Yes. You should serve and file a response called an 
 ﬁopposition. ﬂ 
 As explained in the answer to question , a ﬁperemp-
 tory writ in the first instanceﬂ is an order telling the trial 
 court to do what the petitioner has requested (or some 
 form of what the petitioner requested as ordered by the 
 appellate division) that is issued without the appellate 
 division first issuing an alternative writ or order to show 
 
 cause. The appellate division will not issue a peremptory 
 writ in the first instance without first giving the parties 
 notice and a chance to file an opposition. However, 
 when the appellate division issues such a notice, it 
 means that the appellate division is strongly considering 
 granting the writ requested by the petitioner. 
 An opposition is your argument to the appellate division 
 about why the trial court should not be ordered to do 
 what the petitioner has requested. If you are represented 
 by a lawyer in the writ pr
 oceeding, your lawyer will 
 prepare your opposition. If you are not represented by a 
 lawyer, you will need to prepare your own opposition. 
 Like a return discussed above, an opposition is usually a 
 legal response called an ﬁanswer. ﬂ An answer is used to 
 admit or deny the facts alleged in the petition, to add to 
 or correct the facts, and to explain any legal defenses to 
 the legal arguments made by the petitioner. You should 
 
 read California Code of Civil Procedure sections 
 430. 10Œ430. 80 for more information about answers. You 
 can get copies of these statutes at any county law library 
 or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/faces/codes. xhtml. 
 Unless the appellate division sets a different deadline in 
 its notice that it is considering issuing a peremptory writ, 
 you must serve and file your opposition within 30 days 
 after the appellate division issues the notice. The 
 opposition must be served on all the other parties to the 
 writ proceeding. ﬁServing and filingﬂ the opposition 
 means that you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old mail, deliver, or 
 electronically send (ﬁserveﬂ) the opposition to the 
 other parties in the way required by law. If the 
 opposition is mailed or personally delivered, it must 
 be by someone who is not a party to the caseŠso 
 not you. 
 Make a record that the opposition has been served. 
 This record is called a ﬁproof of service. ﬂ 
 Proof of 
 Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109) or 
 Proof of Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109 E) can be used to make this record. 
 The proof of service must show who served the 
 
 opposition, who was served with the opposition, 
 how the opposition was served (by mail, in person, 
 or electronically) , and the date the opposition was 
 served. 
 File the original opposition and the proof of service 
 with the appellate division. You should make a copy 
 of the opposition you are planning to file for your 
 own records before you file it with the court. It is a 
 good idea to bring or mail an extra copy of the 
 opposition to the clerk when you file your original, 
 
 and ask the clerk to stamp this copy to show that the 
 original has been filed. 
 You can get more information about how to serve court 
 documents and proof of service from 
 What Is Proof of 
 Service? 
 (form APP 109 INFO) and on the California 
 Courts Online Self
 -Help Center at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp serving. htm. 
 After you file a return or opposition, the petitioner has 
 15 days to serve and file a reply. The appellate division 
 may also set the matter for oral argument. When all the 
 
 papers have been filed (or the time to file them has 
 passed) and oral argument is completed, the appellate 
 
 division will decide the case.

 I have received a copy of a notice from 
 the appellate division indicating it is 
 
 considering issuing a peremptory writ 
 
 in the first instance. Do I need to do 
 
 anything?

 return or opposition? 18</div>
