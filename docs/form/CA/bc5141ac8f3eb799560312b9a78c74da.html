      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: You can ask for one if you are connected to the person you think is dangerous as: 
 1. An immediate family member; 
 2. An employer; 
 3. A coworker who has substantial and regular interactions 
 with the person, and has worked with them for at least a 
 year. You must have permission from your employer to ask 
 for this restraining order; 
 4. An employee or teacher at a school that the person has 
 attended in the last six months, and you have permission 
 from a school administrator or a school administration staff 
 who has a supervisorial role; and/or 
 5. A law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency. 
 
 Immediate family members include: 
 (1) Your spouse or domestic partner; 
 (2) Your parents, children, siblings, grandparents, and 
 grandchildren and their spouses, including any stepparent 
 or stepgrandparent; 
 (3) Your spouse™s parents, children (your stepchildren) , 
 siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren; and 
 (4) Any other person who regularly resides in the 
 household, or who, within the last six months, regularly 
 resided in the household. 
 If you do not have the necessary relationship, advise a law 
 enforcement officer of the situation. The officer may 
 investigate and file the petition if he or she finds that the 
 grounds exist. GV 100 INFOCan a Gun Violence Restraining Order Help Me? What is a gun violence restraining order? It is a court order that temporarily prohibits someone from 
 having any guns, ammunition, or magazines (ammunition 
 feeding devices) . The person must surrender all guns, 
 ammunition, and magazines that he or she currently owns. 
 The police will come and remove the guns or the person 
 can store them with a licensed gun dealer while the 
 restraining order is in effect. The restrained person also 
 cannot buy any guns, ammunition, or magazines during 
 this time. Where can I get these forms? Judicial Council of California www. courts. ca. gov Rev. September 1, 2020, Optional Form 
 Penal Code, § 18100 et seq. Can a Gun Violence Restraining Order Help Me? (Gun Violence Prevention) GV 100 INFO, Page 1 of 3 What do I need to do to get the order? You must go to the superior court in the county where the 
 person to be restrained lives. At the court, ask where you 
 should file your request for a gun violence restraining 
 order. (A self help center or legal aid association may be 
 able to assist you in filing your request. ) Give your forms 
 to the clerk of the court. The clerk will give you a hearing 
 date on the Notice of Court Hearing form. These instructions cannot cover all of the questions that may arise in a particular case. If you 
 do not know what to do to protect your rights, you should see a lawyer or a self help center. You can get the forms from legal publishers or on the 
 Internet at www. courts. ca. gov. You also may be able to find them at your local courthouse or county law library. Can I get a gun violence restraining order 
 against someone? Will the order protect me in other ways, such 
 as keeping the person from coming near me? No, the only order the court can make is to force the person 
 to not have firearms, ammunition, or magazines. If you 
 need personal protection from a family member, you 
 should proceed under the Domestic Violence Prevention 
 Act. See Can a Domestic Violence Restraining Order Help 
 Me? (form DV 500 INFO) for information on how to 
 proceed. For information on other civil restraining orders, 
 please see www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp abuse. htm. What forms do I need to get the order? Will I have to pay a filing fee to request the 
 order? No. You must fill out the following forms: 
 o Petition for Gun Violence Restraining Order (form GV 100) ; o Confidential CLETS Information (form CLETS 001) ; o Notice of Court Hearing (form GV 109) , items 1 and 2 only; and o Temporary Gun Violence Restraining Order (form GV 110) , items 1 and 2 only. You may need other local forms. Ask your self help 
 center or visit your court's website. GV 100 INFOCan a Gun Violence Restraining Order Help Me? Rev. September 1, 2020 Can a Gun Violence Restraining Order Help Me? (Gun Violence Prevention) GV 100 INFO, Page 2 of 3 You will have to convince the judge that the person to be restrained poses a significant danger in the near future of 
 causing personal injury to himself, herself, or another 
 person by having in his or her custody or control, owning, 
 purchasing, possessing, or receiving any firearms, 
 ammunition, or magazines. You will also have to convince the judge that a gun violence restraining order is needed to prevent personal 
 injury to the person to be restrained or to another person 
 because less restrictive alternatives either have been tried 
 and haven™t worked, or are inadequate or inappropriate for 
 the current circumstances. What do I have to prove to get the order? How can I convince the judge? You will need to give the judge specific information. You should tell the judge everything that you know about the 
 firearms, ammunition, or magazines that the person to be 
 restrained currently owns, including how many the person 
 owns, the types, and where they are kept. 
 
 Then you will need to present facts to show that the person 
 to be restrained is dangerous. This could be information 
 about any threat of violence that the person to be restrained 
 has made, any violent incident in which the person has 
 been involved, or any crime of violence the person has 
 committed. It could also be evidence that the person to be 
 restrained has violated a protective order or abuses 
 controlled substances or alcohol. It could also be evidence 
 of the unlawful and reckless use, display, or brandishing of a firearm or the recent acquisition of a firearm. Or it could be evidence that the person to be restrained has been identified by a mental health provider as someone 
 prohibited from purchasing, possessing or controlling any 
 firearms. 
 
 You should include all of this information in your Petition 
 and also be prepared to present it to the judge at the 
 hearing. You can ask for a Temporary Gun Violence Restraining 
 Order, which will be effective right away if granted. The 
 court may decide whether or not to grant the temporary 
 order based only on the facts that you have stated in your 
 petition. If so, the court will decide within 24 hours 
 whether or not to make the temporary order. Sometimes the 
 court will want to examine you personally under oath. The 
 clerk will tell you whether you should wait to talk to the 
 judge or come back later to find out if the court has signed 
 a temporary order. 
 
 If you don't ask for a temporary restraining order, you will 
 have to wait until the hearing, at which the court will 
 decide whether to make an order that will last for a period 
 of time between 1 5 years. How soon can I get the order? How will the person to be 
 restrained know about the order? If the court issues a temporary restraining order, someone 
 age 18 or olderŠnot youŠmust personally ﬁserveﬂ (give) the person to be restrained a copy of the order. The server 
 must then fill out Proof of Personal Service (form GV 200) and give it to you to file with the court. If the person to be 
 restrained attends the hearing, no further proof of service is 
 required. But if they do not attend the hearing, then any 
 order issued at the hearing must also be personally served. 
 For help with service, ask the court clerk for What Is ﬁProof of Personal Service? ﬂ (form GV 200 INFO) . Note: A sheriff or marshal can serve the order for free. Having a lawyer is always a good idea, but it is not required and you are not entitled to a free, court appointed attorney. Ask the court clerk about free and low cost legal services and self help centers in your county. Do I need a lawyer? Œ What if I am deaf or hard of hearing? For help in your area, contact: [Local information may be inserted. ] Assistive listening systems, computer assisted real time captioning, or sign 
 language interpreter services are 
 available if you ask at least five days 
 before the hearing. Contact the clerk™s 
 office or go to www. courts. ca. gov/forms for Request for Accommodations by Persons with Disabilities and Response (Form MC 410) . (Civ. Code, § 54. 8. ) Can I agree with the restrained person to 
 terminate the order? No. Once the order is issued, only the judge can change or 
 terminate it. The restrained person would have to file a 
 request with the court to terminate the order. What if I need help to understand 
 English? When you file your papers, ask your court s€clerk or self help center€if your court will provide an interpreter for you at no cost. If not, you will have to pay a fee for the 
 interpreter. If an interpreter is not available for your 
 court date, you should ask someone who is over age 18 
 to interpret for you. GV 100 INFOCan a Gun Violence Restraining Order Help Me? Rev. September 1, 2020 Can a Gun Violence Restraining Order Help Me? (Gun Violence Prevention) GV 100 INFO, Page 3 of 3 If the court makes a temporary order, it will last until your 
 hearing date, which must be within 21 days of the date of 
 the temporary order. If at the hearing the court issues a 
 more permanent order, it will last for one to five years. It 
 may be renewed for an additional one to five years. How long does the order last? Call the police. The restrained person can be arrested and 
 charged with a crime. What if the restrained person does not obey 
 the order? ™Yes. Go to court on the date the clerk gives you. Do I have to go to court? Ł WitnessesŁ Written statements from witnesses made under oathŁ PhotosŁ Medical or police reportsŁ Damaged propertyŁ Threatening letters, emails, or telephone messages Do I need to bring a witness to the hearing? Witnesses are not required, but it helps to have more proof 
 than just your word. For example, consider bringing: The court may or may not let witnesses speak at the hearing. So, if possible, you should bring their written 
 statements under oath to the hearing. (You can use 
 Declaration (form MC 030) for this purpose. ) Yes. You can bring someone to sit with you during the 
 hearing, but that person cannot speak for you in court. Only 
 you or your lawyer (if you have one) can speak for you. Can I bring someone with me to court? If the person comes to the hearing, yes. If you are afraid, 
 tell the court officer. Will I see the restrained person at the court 
 hearing? </div>
