hapter 1  PURPOSE OF FORMS 

1.000.  Definitions 
For the purposes of these instructions the following words are synonymous: (a) Notice to 
Appear, citation; (b) violation, offense, allegation, charges; (c) defendant, violator, 
person, individual, citee, driver; (d) court, court of jurisdiction; (e) officer, arresting 
officer, citing officer, issuing officer. 

1.010.  In General 
Notice to Appear forms are designed to meet statutory requirements and, to the extent 
possible, address the procedural requirements of local courts and law enforcement 
agencies.  Notices to Appear should provide the defendant with pertinent information 
regarding the charges and what steps the defendant must take to answer the allegations. 

he uniform language and data fields assist law enforcement and the courts in the timely 

and accurate processing of the citation information.  The design also ensures statewide 
conformity of advisements important to the defendant and that those advisements are 
clear and explicit. 

1.020.  Notice to Appear 
a)  Whenever a person is arrested for any violation declared to be an infraction or 

misdemeanor, or for a violation of any city or county ordinance, and the person is not 
immediately taken before a magistrate, the arresting officer must prepare a Notice to 
Appear form.1   

)  When the Notice to Appear is prepared on a form approved by the Judicial Council it 

constitutes a complaint to which the defendant may enter a plea.2   

1.030.  Continuation Form 
a)  The Continuation of Notice to Appear or Continuation of Citation form must be used 
when multiple offenses are charged and the Notice to Appear form does not provide 
sufficient space for the listing of all the charges. A Continuation of Citation is a 
multipurpose form intended for use with either a Notice to Appear form or a Notice 
to Correct Violation form. 

)  A second Notice to Appear must not be issued in lieu of a continuation form. 

)  The Notice to Appear and the corresponding continuation form must be treated as one 

law enforcement document and contain the same citation number. 

 

d)  Form TR-135, Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (4-inch format), may, 

when necessary, include a short-version continuation page to allow for citing multiple 
offenses or offenses that involve multiple vehicles.

.040.  Electronic Notice to Appear 

a)  The electronic Notice to Appear issued on either form TR-135, Electronic 

Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (4-inch format) or form TR-145, Electronic 
Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (3-inch format), eliminates those citation-
processing problems caused by the illegibility of handwritten information.  The use of 
an electronic Notice to Appear also reduces the amount of information that must be 
entered into law enforcement and court computer systems. 

)  A court is authorized to receive and file a Notice to Appear in an electronic form if all 

of the following conditions are met:3 

1)  The information is on a form approved by the Judicial Council.  

2)  The Notice to Appear is transmitted to the court by a law enforcement 

agency. 

3)  The court has the facility to electronically store the information for the 

statutory period of record retention. 

4)  The court has the ability to reproduce the Notice to Appear in physical 

form upon the demand and payment of the reproduction costs. 
 

c)   Requirements for citations issued by an electronic citation device on form TR-135 or 
form TR-145 that differ from those for preprinted citations are specified below where 
necessary. 

.050.  Notice of Correction and Proof of Service 

Form TR-100, Notice of Correction and Proof of Service, must be used for any corrections 
to the original Notice to Appear citation.4 (See Appendix A.) 

1)  Form TR-115, Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear,5 
to be used in conjunction with violations of sections 22451, 21453, and 
22101 recorded by an automated traffic enforcement system. (See 
Appendix D.) 

)  Form TR-120, Nontraffic Notice to Appear,6 to be used for violations 

other than traffic offenses. (See Appendix E.)

3)  Form TR-130, Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear,7 to be used for both 

infraction and misdemeanor offenses. (See Appendix F.)  
 

4)   Forms TR-135 and TR-1458 to be used for both infraction and 

misdemeanor offenses. (See Appendix G and Appendix H.) A computer-
generated paper citation is issued to the defendant at the time of arrest and 
a copy is filed with the court either electronically when permitted or as a 
paper copy. 

)  Form TR-106, Continuation of Notice to Appear, and form TR-108, Continuation of 
Citation, are intended for use in conjunction with Nontraffic and Traffic/Nontraffic 
Notice to Appear forms. (See Appendix B.) 

) The Judicial Council has not adopted a form for, nor established guidelines governing, 
the following: (1) parking citations, (2) arrest/booking reports, and (3) court bail 
courtesy notices. 

hapter 3  REVISION DATES 

 3.010.  Judicial Council 
a)  Periodically, the Judicial Council will adopt revisions of Notice to Appear forms.  
Law enforcement must use the revised Notice to Appear form by the effective 
date of the revised form adopted by the Judicial Council.  (See section 6.030 for 
exception.)  Depending on changes in statutory requirements, effective dates are 
established to allow law enforcement as much time as possible to deplete any existing 
supplies of the old form, print and disseminate new forms, and, if necessary, develop 
new procedures and train personnel regarding the revisions. 

)  The council adopted forms TR-135 and TR-145 and revised forms TR-115, TR-120, 
and TR-130, effective June 26, 2015, with implementation as soon as reasonably 
possible, but no later than November 15, 2015. The council adopted forms TR-100, 
TR-106, and TR-108 with an effective date of January 1, 2004.  

hapter 4  FORM SPECIFICATIONS 

 4.010.  Required Copies 
The arresting officer must prepare the Notice to Appear form, at a minimum, in triplicate 
with a copy delivered to the court and the issuing agency for Vehicle Code violations8 
and in duplicate for all other violations.9  The copy of the citation issued to the arrested  
person must include all of the information on the copy of the citation filed with the court, 
including any signature for the defendant’s promise to appear.10 Before printing or 
programming Notice to Appear forms, law enforcement agencies should contact their 
local court to determine if there are any local requirements for the court’s case 
management system.

4.060.  Printing Expenses 
The printing of the forms and the associated costs are not the responsibility of the 
Judicial Council; printing is to be arranged in accordance with local custom. 

hapter 5  VARIATIONS OF MANDATORY LANGUAGE/DATA 

FIELDS 

5.000.  In General 
Mandatory language and data fields are indicated on examples of Judicial Council–
adopted forms by unshaded areas; see section 5.010 for exceptions. 

5.010.  Permitted Variations 
a) To meet the unique customs and/or needs of local law enforcement agencies and 

courts, the Judicial Council form permits limited variations in the “time,” “place,” and 
“proof of correction certification” data fields, among others.  To indicate that 
variations may be permitted, these data fields are identified by shaded areas.  Shading 
should not appear on printed forms.   

) The California Highway Patrol is permitted to alter the format and location of the 

fields for the name of the court, court address, and phone number and to add a field for 
the location of a CHP Inspection Facility on the face of a form TR-130, 
Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear for their form CHP-215X.  

)  Formatting for the bracketed information that is required in the “Where” field on  
     notice to appear forms may be modified to include information for multiple court  
     locations. 

hapter 6  MANDATORY LANGUAGE/DATA FIELDS  

6.000.  In General 
The mandatory language and data fields vary between the various Notice to Appear 
forms depending on the purpose of the form.  All language and data fields in unshaded 
areas on the forms are mandatory, even if not discussed below. Mandatory text or data 
fields of the forms may not be re-worded or omitted, except for references to statutory 
authorities, which may be abbreviated differently. Electronic Notice to Appear citations 
issued on forms TR-135 and TR-145 may abbreviate terms to facilitate printing of forms.  

aw enforcement agencies should be aware that if a written Notice to Appear is not 

prepared on an approved council form, a court may conclude that it does not constitute a 
complaint to which a defendant may enter a plea.  (Veh. Code, § 40513(b).) If a 
defendant pleads other than “guilty” or “nolo contendere” and the court concludes that 
the Notice to Appear is defective, it could be necessary to re-file the charges by a formal 
complaint. (Veh. Code, § 40513(a).)

6.010.  Agency Name 
The name of the citing agency and jurisdiction must appear near the top of the form. 

6.020. Title of Form 
The title of the form must be printed near the top of the form. 

6.030.  Serial Number 
a)  A sequential serial number for each multipart set of Notice to Appear forms must 

appear horizontally near the top right corner of each form.   

)  To facilitate the filing systems of some courts, statewide law enforcement agencies 
must also print the serial number in the lower right margin of the court’s copy.  
Statewide law enforcement agencies must comply with this requirement as specified 
in section 3.010.  Local law enforcement agencies must comply with the requirement 
for the duplication of the serial number in the right margin within one calendar year 
of a request from a local court. 

)  The serial number may be preprinted on the Notice to Appear. 

)  The serial number on continuation form TR-106 or TR-108 must be the same as that 
on the corresponding Notice to Appear; the duplication of the serial number in the 
right margin is not required. 

)  Bar coding of the serial number permits those courts with bar code readers to improve 

the timeliness and accuracy of processing Notice to Appear forms. Within the 
following parameters, the bar coding of the serial number must be placed on the face 
of the court’s copy of the Notice to Appear form: 

1.  The bar code must appear as near as practical to the bottom of the form and is the 

USS Code 39 barcode data format. 

.  The bar code should have a 1/4-inch area (quiet zone) that is clear and free of all 

printing preceding the start character and the following stop character. 

.  Statewide law enforcement agencies must comply with the bar code requirement 

as specified in section 3.010. 

.  Local law enforcement agencies must comply with the bar code requirement 

within one calendar year of a request from a local court.

exist.  

)  The correctable violation advisement and the check boxes do not appear on the 

Automated Traffic Enforcement System notice form, TR-115. 

6.170.  Booking Required 
The officer may either book the arrested person prior to release, or indicate on the Notice 
to Appear that the arrested person must be booked before appearing in court.19 If the

6.210.  Officer’s Declaration on Information and Belief 
The officer must indicate on the Notice to Appear (check box) when the offense was not 
committed in his/her presence and that his/her declaration is on information and belief. A 
citizen’s complaint and a collision investigation are examples of a situation that may 
result in the officer checking the box.  The declaration is separate and distinct from the 
officer’s declaration under penalty of perjury discussed in section 6.220. 

6.220.  Officer’s Declaration under Penalty of Perjury 
The Notice to Appear must contain the officer’s dated declaration, under penalty of 
perjury, subscribed by the officer, that the information regarding the violations is true and 
correct.22  The date of the declaration must appear in the declaration date field when 
completed by either an arresting or a citing officer. 

6.230.  Other Officer 
The name of the arresting officer, if different from the name of the officer completing the 
Notice to Appear, must be stated on the Notice to Appear.  This policy was adopted to 
address situations in which there are teams of officers working radar enforcement or aerial 
patrol.  This option is not available on the Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to 
Appear. (See section 6.231.) 

6.231.  Declarant-Automated Traffic Enforcement System Citations 
The name of the government agency or law enforcement representative making the 
declaration, “Violation was not committed in my presence.  The above is declared on 
information and belief and is based on photographic evidence,” must be stated on the

.240.  Defendant’s Signature 

To secure release from arrest, the defendant must give his/her written promise to 
appear.23 The defendant’s signature on the defendant’s copy of the citation must be 
identical to the signature on the copy of the citation filed with the court. The requirement 
for a signed promise to appear does not apply to citations issued for violations recorded 
by an Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear. 

.250.  Time to Appear 

a)  The time specified in a Notice to Appear issued for a traffic offense must be a 

specific date which is at least 21 days after arrest; the court having jurisdiction over 
the offense charged may authorize the arresting officer to specify on the Notice to 
Appear that the appearance may be made before the time specified.24   

)  When a Notice to Appear has been issued for a violation recorded by an automated 
traffic enforcement system, it must be mailed within 15 days of the violation date to 
the current address of the registered owner of the vehicle on file with the Department

time to appear must be at least ten days after the Notice to Appear is delivered.26 

)  The time to appear placed on Notice to Appear for a nontraffic offense must be at 

least 10 days after the date of arrest for a nontraffic violation. (Pen. Code, § 853.6.) 

)  In the case of juveniles, the court having jurisdiction over the offense charged may 

require the arresting officer to indicate on the Notice to Appear “to be notified” rather 
than a specific date.27 

6.260.  Place to Appear 
The place specified on the Notice to Appear must be one of the following: 

)  Before a magistrate or judge.28 

)  Before a person authorized to receive a deposit of bail.29 

)  Before the juvenile court, juvenile court referee, or juvenile hearing officer.30  

6.270.  Night Court 
If the court identified in the Notice to Appear holds night sessions, the notice must 
include a statement advising the defendant.31 

6.280.  Legend 
The lower left corner of the Notice to Appear forms must denote that the form is a 
Judicial Council form and specify the council’s form number.  

hapter 7  DISCRETIONARY LANGUAGE/DATA FIELDS 

7.000.  In General 
The discretionary (shaded) areas on the forms (see Appendix) depict language and data 
fields that are frequently included at the option of the court or law enforcement agency 
(with the consent of the court in which the Notice to Appear is to be filed).   

ecause of limited space, not all of the discretionary language and data fields used 
throughout the state can be shown on the sample forms. The following are narrative 
descriptions of several discretionary data fields.

7.010.  Bail Statement 
If the offense is bailable, the magistrate must fix the amount of bail and endorse the 
following statement on the warrant for arrest.32 
   
BAIL: 
          The defendant is to be admitted to bail in the sum of           dollars. 

                                                                                       

   

 

Judge 

ote:  The mandatory requirement that the above statement appear on the reverse of the 

court’s copy disrupts the processing of Notice to Appear forms in those automated 
courts` that use the space for cash register validations, automated traffic system 
notations, and notes of court proceedings.  These courts use a separate form when issuing 
a warrant for arrest.  For those reasons, the warrant for arrest statement is now 
discretionary. 

7.020.    Defendant’s Race/Ethnicity 
a)  A specific data field for the defendant’s “Race” or “Ethnicity” may be added to the 
Notice to Appear form.  The data field should be located on the same line as other 
physical descriptors. 

)  The defendant’s “Race” or “Ethnicity” may be indicated in the “Other Description” 

data field. 

)  If the defendant’s “Race” or “Ethnicity” is to be indicated, the Judicial Council 

recommends the use of a single alpha character.  Reference:  California Department 
of Justice’s Arrest and Disposition Instruction Manual. 

7.030.    Defendant’s Thumbprint 
a)  The defendant’s thumbprint may be placed on the Notice to Appear in situations in 
which there is a question in the citing officer’s mind as to the true identity of the 
defendant.  The court will then have the option of comparing thumbprints in those  
cases where the defendant alleges that another person has committed the cited 
offense.33 

)  The Judicial Council recommends that the thumbprint on form TR-120 or TR-130 be 
placed in a one-inch square area located on the reverse of the court’s copy in the 
lower left corner. For citations on forms TR-135 or TR-145, a digitized thumbprint or 
fingerprint may be printed on the defendant’s paper copy of the citation and filed with 
the court as part of the notice to appear. If the defendant’s thumbprint or fingerprint is 
captured electronically as a digital image, but not included as part of the notice to 
appear, the digital image may be retained by the arresting agency for use as provided 
in Penal Code sections 853.5 and 853.6 and Vehicle Code sections 40500 and 40504 
and any other purposes permitted by law.

Chapter 8  PROHIBITED LANGUAGE/DATA FIELDS 

8.010.    Defendant’s Social Security Number 
The defendant’s social security number must not be indicated on the Notice to Appear, 
unless the social security number is also the driver license number and/or the defendant 
holds a commercial driver license. 

o protect an individual’s civil rights, federal statutes allow a very restricted compulsory 

use of a person’s social security number for the purpose of establishing identity.34  

ederal statutes do permit an agency having administrative responsibility for driver 
license and motor vehicle registration laws to use a person’s social security number to 
establish that person’s identity as it relates to the laws within the agency’s jurisdiction.35 

he California Department of Motor Vehicles requires an individual to disclose his or her 

social security number in order to obtain a driver license or identification card.36 A 
number of other states use the individual’s social security number as the driver license 
number.

IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY 
LOCAL  INFORMATION  FOR  THE  CITATION  IS  AVAILABLE  ONLINE 
AT [website address] 
WARNING:  If you fail to appear in court as you have promised, you may be arrested and punished 
by  6  MONTHS  IN  JAIL  AND/OR  A  $1,000  FINE  regardless  of  the  disposition  of  the  original  charge.  
(Veh. Code, § 40508 or Pen. Code, § 853.7.)  In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided 
by law may be deemed to have elected to have a trial by written declaration (in absentia) pursuant to 
Vehicle  Code  section  40903(a)  upon  any  alleged  infraction,  as  charged  by  the  arresting/citing 
officer. 
JUVENILE:    If  you  were  under  age  18  at  the  time  the  citation  was  issued,  you  must  appear  in  court  with 
your parent or guardian. 
COURTESY NOTICE:  A courtesy notice may be mailed to the address shown on your citation, indicating 
the required deposit of money (bail) that may be forfeited instead of your appearing in court.  If you do not 
receive such courtesy notice, you are still required to comply with the items below by the appearance date. 
WHAT TO DO 

You are required to appear at court for a misdemeanor violation.  For all violations, your court 
date/time/place are on the front of this notice to appear.  Have the citation with you when contacting the 
court.  In all infraction cases, you must do one or more of the following for each violation: 
         Pay the fine (bail). 
         Appear in court. 
         Contest the violation.  
If you do not do one of the above actions, then a “failure to appear” charge will be filed against you (Veh. 
Code,  §  40508(a))  and  your  driver  license  may  be  withheld,  suspended,  or  revoked.    In  some  courts you 
may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection 
agency. (Pen. Code, § 1214.1.)   

 Correct the violation (traffic cases, when applicable). 
 Request traffic school (traffic cases, when applicable). 
 Request trial by written declaration (traffic cases). 

If you do NOT contest the violation: 

a.       (Pay the bail amount) Contact the court for bail information.  You will not have to appear in court.  
You will be convicted of the violation, and it will appear on your record at the Department of Motor Vehicles 
(DMV).  A point count may be charged to your DMV record and your insurance may be adversely affected. 

.       (Traffic school) You may be able to avoid the point count by completing traffic school.  You must 

pay the bail amount, and you may have to pay other fees.  Contact the court to request traffic school. 

.            (Correctable  violations)  If  the  “Yes”  box  is  checked  on  the  front  of  your  ticket,  the  violation  is 
correctable.    Upon  correction  of  the  violation,  have  a  law  enforcement  officer  or  an  authorized 
inspection/installation  station  agent  sign  below.    (Veh.  Code,  §  40616.)    Registration  and  driver  license 
violations  may  also  be  certified  as  corrected  at  an  office  of  the  DMV  or  by  any  clerk  or  deputy  clerk  of  a 
court.  The  violation  will  be  dismissed  by  the  court  after  PROOF  OF  CORRECTION  and  payment  of  a 
transaction  fee  are  presented  to  the  court  by  mail  or  in  person  by  the  appearance  date.  Violations  of 
Vehicle Code section 16028 (automobile liability insurance) will be dismissed only upon (1) your showing 
or  mailing  to  the  court  evidence  of  financial  responsibility  valid  at  the  time  this  notice  to  appear  was 
issued, and (2) your payment of a transaction fee.

a.            (Court  trial)  Send  a  certified  or  registered  letter  postmarked  not  later  than  five  days  prior  to  the 
appearance date or come to the court by the appearance date to request a court trial on a future date when 
an officer and any witnesses will be present.  You may be required to submit the bail amount.  
Go online or call the court for information on going to court without paying bail. —OR— 

.            (Trial  by  written  declaration  (traffic  cases))  Send  a  certified  or  registered  letter  postmarked  not 
later than five days prior to the appearance date or come to the court on or before the appearance date to 
request  a  trial  by  written  declaration.    Submit  the  bail  amount.    You  will  be  given  forms  to  allow  you  to 
write  a  statement  and  to  submit  other  evidence  without  appearing  in  court.    An  officer  will  also  submit  a 
statement.  The judicial officer will consider the evidence and decide the case. 
 
3.     Make check/money order payable to Clerk of the Court. Write your citation number and driver license 
number on your check or money order.  You may pay in person, by mail, or by phone.

IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY

  WARNING:    If  you  fail to  appear  in court  as  you  have  promised,  you  may  be 
arrested  and  punished  by  6  MONTHS  IN  JAIL  AND/OR  A  $1,000  FINE 
regardless  of  the  disposition  of  the  original  charge.    (Veh.  Code, §  40508,  or 
Pen. Code, § 853.7.) In addition, any person who fails to appear as provided by 
law  may  be  deemed  to  have  elected  to  have  a  trial by written  declaration  (in 
absentia)  pursuant  to  Vehicle  Code  section  40903(a)  upon  any  alleged 
infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer. 

JUVENILE:  If you were under age 18 at the time the citation was issued, you must 
appear in court with your parent or guardian. 

COURTESY NOTICE:  A courtesy notice may be mailed to the address shown on 
your  citation,  indicating  the  required  deposit  of  money  (bail)  that  may  be  forfeited 
instead of your appearing in court.  If you do not receive such courtesy notice, you 
are still required to comply with the items below by the appearance date. 

WHAT TO DO 
You are required to appear at court for a misdemeanor violation. For all violations, 
your  court  date/time/place  are  provided  above  in  this  notice  to  appear.  Have  the 
citation with you when contacting the court.  In all infraction cases, you must do one 
or more of the following for each violation: 
 Pay the fine (bail).          Correct the violation (traffic cases, when applicable). 
 Appear in court.              Request traffic school (traffic cases, when applicable). 
 Contest the violation.      Request trial by written declaration (traffic cases). 
If you do not do one of the above actions, then a “failure to appear” charge will be 
filed against you (Veh. Code, § 40508(a)) and your driver license may be withheld, 
suspended, or revoked.  In some courts you may be charged an amount in addition 
to the bail amount and the case may be turned over to a collection agency. (Pen. 
Code, § 1214.1.)   
1.    If you do NOT contest the violation: 
a.    (Pay the bail amount) Contact the court for bail information. You will not have 
to appear in court. You will be convicted of the violation, and it will appear on your 
record at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). A point count may be charged 
to your DMV record, and your insurance may be adversely affected. 

.     (Traffic school) You may be able to avoid the point count by completing traffic 
school.  You  must  pay  the  bail  amount  as  a  fee,  and  you  may  have  to  pay  other 
fees. Contact the court to request traffic school. 

.          (Correctable  violations)  If  the  “Yes”  box  is  checked  above,  the  violation  is 
correctable. Upon correction of the violation, have a law enforcement officer or an 
authorized  inspection/installation  station  agent  sign  below.  (Veh.  Code,  §  40616.)  
Registration  and  driver  license  violations  may  also  be  certified  as  corrected  at  an 
office  of  the  DMV  or  by  any  clerk  or  deputy  clerk  of  a  court.  The  violation  will  be 
dismissed  by  the  court  after  PROOF  OF  CORRECTION  and  payment  of  a 
transaction fee are presented to the court by mail or in person by the appearance 
date.  Violations  of Vehicle  Code section  16028  (automobile  liability  insurance)  will 
be  dismissed  only  upon  (1)  your  showing  or  mailing  to  the  court  evidence  of 
financial  responsibility  valid  at  the  time  this  notice  to  appear  was  issued,  and  (2) 
your payment of a transaction fee.

  WARNING:  If you fail to appear in court as you have promised, 
you  may  be  arrested  and  punished  by  6  MONTHS  IN  JAIL 
AND/OR  A  $1,000  FINE  regardless  of  the  disposition  of  the 
original charge.    (Veh.  Code, §  40508  or Pen.  Code, §  853.7.)   In 
addition, any person who fails to appear as provided by law may 
be deemed to have elected to have a trial by written declaration

any alleged infraction, as charged by the arresting/citing officer. 
JUVENILE:    If  you  were  under  age  18  at  the  time  the  citation  was 
issued, you must appear in court with your parent or guardian. 
COURTESY  NOTICE:    A  courtesy  notice  may  be  mailed  to  the 
address  shown  on  your  citation,  indicating  the  required  deposit  of

If  you  do  not  receive  such  courtesy  notice,  you  are  still  required  to 
comply with the items below by the appearance date. 

 

 

WHAT TO DO
You are required to appear at court for a misdemeanor violation.  For 
all  violations,  your  court  date/time/place  are  provided  above  in  this 
notice  to  appear.    Have  the  citation  with  you  when  contacting  the 
court.    In  all  infraction  cases,  you  must  do  one  or  more  of  the 
following for each violation: 
 Pay the fine (bail).          Correct the violation (traffic cases,

 Appear in court.              Request traffic school (traffic cases,

                                               (traffic cases). 
If you do not do one of the above actions, then a “failure to appear” 
charge  will  be  filed  against  you  (Veh.  Code,  §  40508(a))  and  your 
driver  license  may  be  withheld,  suspended,  or  revoked.    In  some 
courts you may be charged an amount in addition to the bail amount 
and the case may be turned over to a collection agency.

and your insurance may be adversely affected. 

.     (Traffic school) You may be able to avoid the point count by 
completing  traffic  school.    You  must  pay  the  bail  amount  as  a  fee,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
