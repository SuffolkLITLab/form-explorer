 Chapter 1 PURPOSE OF FORMS 
 
 1. 000. Definitions For the purposes of these instructions the following words are synonymous: (a) Notice to 
 Appear, citation; (b) violation, offense, allegation, charges; (c) defendant, violator, person, individual, citee, driver; (d) court, court of jurisdiction; (e) officer, arresting 
 officer, citing officer, issuing officer. 
 1. 010. In General Notice to Appear forms are designed to meet statutory requirements and, to the extent 
 possible, address the procedural requirements of local courts and law enforcement 
 
 agencies. Notices to Appear should provide the defendant with pertinent information 
 
 regarding the charges and what steps the defendant must take to answer the allegations. 
 
 
 The uniform language and data fields assist law enforcement and the courts in the timely 
 
 and accurate processing of the citation information. The design also ensures statewide 
 
 conformity of advisements important to the defendant and that those advisements are 
 
 clear and explicit. 
 1. 020. Notice to Appear a) Whenever a person is arrested for any violation declared to be an infraction or 
 misdemeanor, or for a violation of any city or county ordinance, and the person is not 
 
 immediately taken before a magistrate, the arresting officer must prepare a Notice to 
 
 Appear form. 
 1 
 b) When the Notice to Appear is prepared on a form approved by the Judicial Council it 
 
 constitutes a complaint to which the defendant may enter a plea. 
 2 1. 030. Continuation Form a) The Continuation of Notice to Appear or Continuation of Citation form must be used 
 when multiple offenses are charged and the Notice to Appear form does not provide 
 sufficient space for the listing of all the charges. A Continuation of Citation is a multipurpose form intended for use with either a Notice to Appear form or a Notice 
 
 to Correct Violation form. 
 
 b) A second Notice to Appear must not be issued in lieu of a continuation form. 
 
 c) The Notice to Appear and the corresponding continuation form must be treated as one 
 
 law enforcement document and contain the same citation number. 
 d) Form TR 135, 
 Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (4 inch format) , may, 
 when necessary, include a short version continuation page to allow for citing multiple 
 
 offenses or offenses that involve multiple vehicles.

 § 40500 (a) and Pen. Code, 
 § 853. 6. 2 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40513 (b) and Pen. Code, 
 § 853. 9. _ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ 2 
 1. 040. Electronic Notice to Appear a) The electronic Notice to Appear issued on either form TR 135, 
 Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (4 inch format) 
 or form TR 145, 
 Electronic Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear (3 inch format) , eliminates those citation-
 processing problems caused by the illegibility of handwritten information. The use of 
 an electronic Notice to Appear also reduces the amount of information that must be 
 
 entered into law enforcement and court computer systems. 
 
 b) A court is authorized to receive and file a Notice to Appear in an electronic form if all 
 of the following conditions are met: 
 3 1) The information is on a form approved by the Judicial Council. 
 2) The Notice to Appear is transmitted to the court by a law enforcement 
 
 agency. 3) The court has the facility to electronically store the information for the 
 
 statutory period of record retention. 4) The court has the ability to reproduce the Notice to Appear in physical 
 form upon the demand and payment of the reproduction costs. 
 
 c) Requirements for citations issued by an electronic citation device on form TR 135 or 
 form TR 145 that differ from those for prep
 rinted citations are specified below where necessary. 
 1. 050. Notice of Correction and Proof of Service Form TR 100, 
 Notice of Correction and Proof of Service, must be used for any corrections 
 to the original Notice to Appear citation. 4 (See Appendix A. ) Chapter 2 AUTHORITY TO PRESCRIBE FORMAT 
 2. 010. Judicial Council a) The Judicial Council has adopted five forms for the Notice to Appear: 
 1) Form TR 115, 
 Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear, 5 to be used in conjunction with violations of sections 22451, 21453, and 
 22101 recorded by an automated traffic enforcement system. (See 
 
 Appendix D. ) 
 2) Form TR 120, 
 Nontraffic Notice to Appear, 6 to be used for violations other than traffic offenses. (See Appendix E. ) 
 3 Per Pen. Code, 
 § 959. 1. 4 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40505. 5 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40518. 6 Per Pen. Code, 
 § 853. 9. _ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ 3 
 3) Form TR 130, 
 Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear, 7 to be used for both infraction and misdemeanor offenses. (See Appendix F. ) 
 4) Forms TR 135 and TR 145
 8 to be used for both infraction and misdemeanor offenses. (See Appendix G and Appendix H. ) A computer-
 
 generated paper citation is issued to the defendant at the time of arrest and 
 
 a copy is filed with the court either electronically when permitted or as a 
 
 paper copy. 
 b) Form TR 106, 
 Continuation of Notice to Appear, and form TR 108, 
 Continuation of Citation, are intended for use in conjunction with Nontraffic and Traffic/Nontraffic Notice to Appear forms. (See Appendix B. ) 
 
 c) The Judicial Council has not adopted a form for, nor established guidelines governing, 
 the following: (1) parking citations, (2) arrest/booking reports, and (3) court bail 
 courtesy notices. 
 Chapter 3 REVISION DATES
 3. 010. Judicial Council a) Periodically, the Judicial Council will adopt revisions of Notice to Appear forms. 
 Law enforcement must use the revised Notice to Appear form by the effective 
 
 date of the revised form adopted by the Judicial Council. (See section 6. 030 for exception. ) Depending on changes in statutory requirements, effective dates are 
 
 established to allow law enforcement as much time as possible to deplete any existing 
 
 supplies of the old form, print and disseminate new forms, and, if necessary, develop 
 
 new procedures and train personnel regarding the revisions. 
 b) The council adopted forms TR 135 and TR 145 and revised forms TR 115, TR 120, 
 
 and TR 130, effective June 26, 2015, with implementation as soon as reasonably 
 
 possible, but no later than November 15, 2015. The council adopted forms TR 100, 
 
 TR 106, and TR 108 with an effective date of January 1, 2004. Chapter 4 FORM SPECIFICATIONS 
 4. 010. Required Copies The arresting officer must prepare the Notice to Appear form, at a minimum, in triplicate 
 with a copy delivered to the court and the issuing agency for Vehicle Code violations 8 and in duplicate for all other violations. 9 The copy of the citation issued to the arrested person must include all of the information on th
 e copy of the citation filed with the court, including any signature for the defendant™s promise to appear. 
 10 Before printing or programming Notice to Appear forms, law enforcement agencies should contact their

 management system.

 Chapter 5 VARIATIONS OF MANDATORY LANGUAGE/DATA 
 FIELDS 5. 000. In General Mandatory language and data fields are indicated on examples of Judicial CouncilŒ
 adopted forms by unshaded areas; see section 5. 010 for exceptions. 
 
 5. 010. Permitted Variations a) To meet the unique customs and/or needs of local law enforcement agencies and 
 courts, the Judicial Council form permits limited variations in the ﬁtime, ﬂ ﬁplace, ﬂ and 
 ﬁproof of correction certificationﬂ data fields, among others. To indicate that 
 
 variations may be permitted, these data fields are identified by shaded areas. Shading 
 
 should not appear on printed forms. 
 
 b) The California Highway Patrol is permitted to alter the format and location of the 
 fields for the name of the court, court address, and phone number and to add a field for

 Chapter 6 MANDATORY LANGUAGE/DATA FIELDS 
 6. 000. In General The mandatory language and data fields vary between the various Notice to Appear 
 forms depending on the purpose of the form. All language and data fields in unshaded 
 
 areas on the forms are mandatory, even if not discussed below. Mandatory text or data 
 
 fields of the forms may not be re worded or omitted, except for references to statutory 
 
 authorities, which may be abbreviated differently. Electronic Notice to Appear citations 
 
 issued on forms TR 135 and TR 145 may abbreviate terms to facilitate printing of forms. 
 
 
 Law enforcement agencies should be aware that if a written Notice to Appear is not 
 
 prepared on an approved council form, a court may conclude that it does not constitute a 
 
 complaint to which a defendant may enter a plea. (Veh. Code, § 40513 (b) . ) If a 
 
 defendant pleads other than ﬁguiltyﬂ or ﬁnolo contendereﬂ and the court concludes that 
 
 the Notice to Appear is defective, it could be necessary to re file the charges by a formal 
 
 complaint. (Veh. Code, § 40513 (a) . )

 in section 3. 010. Local law enforcement agencies must comply with the requirement 
 
 for the duplication of the serial number in the right margin within one calendar year 
 
 of a request from a local court. 
 
 c) The serial number may be preprinted on the Notice to Appear.

 on the corresponding Notice to Appear; the duplication of the serial number in the 
 
 right margin is not required.

 the timeliness and accuracy of processing Notice to Appear forms. Within the 
 
 following parameters, the bar coding of the serial number must be placed on the face

 1. The bar code must appear as near as practical to the bottom of the form and is the

 offense charged and note in a form approved by the Judicial Council that the charge 
 
 13 Commercial vehicle is defined in Veh. Code, 
 § 15210 (b) . The requirement to indicate if offense involves a 
 motor vehicle is per Veh. Code,

 indicate by marking the appropriate ﬁYesﬂ or ﬁNoﬂ check box whether or not the 
 
 offense is eligible for dismissal upon proof of timely correction. Marking the ﬁNoﬂ 
 
 box denotes that disqualifying conditions specified in Vehicle Code section 40610 (b) 
 
 exist. 
 c) The correctable violation advisement and the check boxes do not appear on the 
 
 Automated Traffic Enforcement System notice form, TR 115. 
 6. 170. Booking Required The officer may either book the arrested person prior to release, or indicate on the Notice 
 to Appear that the arrested person must be booked before appearing in court. 
 19 If the ﬁBooking Requiredﬂ check box is checked on form TR 120, TR 130, TR 135, or TR 145 
 
 the arresting agency must complete the verification of booking section on the defendant™s 
 
 copy of the form. The ﬁbooking requiredﬂ check box does not appear on the 
 Automated Traffic Enforcement System notice form, TR 115. 
 6. 180. Violations The Notice to Appear must state the offenses charged. 
 20 Forms TR 135 and TR 145 may 
 include special data fields to cite construction zone violations (Veh. Code, § 42009) , Safety Enhancement Double Fine Zone violations (Veh. Code, § 42010) , and overweight 
 
 violations (Veh. Code, §§ 42030 and 42030. 1) . 6. 190. Speed A Notice to Appear charging a speeding violation must specify the approximate 
 
 speed, prima facie or maximum speed, and any other speed limit exceeded. 
 21 
 a) The ﬁsafe speedﬂ box is provided so that the officer can indicate a speed different 
 from the maximum or prima facie (posted) speed when the Notice to Appear is

 § 40522. 19 Per Pen. Code, 
 § 853. 6. 20 Per Veh. Code,

 § 853. 6. 21 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40503. _ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ 10 6. 210. Officer™s Declaration on Information and Belief The officer must indicate on the Notice to Appear (check box) when the offense was not 
 committed in his/her presence and that his/her declaration is on information and belief. A 
 
 citizen™s complaint and a collision investigation are examples of a situation that may 
 
 result in the officer checking the box. The declaration is separate and distinct from the 
 
 officer™s declaration under penalty of perjury discussed in section 6. 220. 
 6. 220. Officer™s Declaration under Penalty of Perjury The Notice to Appear must contain the officer™s dated declaration, under penalty of 
 perjury, subscribed by the officer, that the information regarding the violations is true and 
 
 correct. 22 The date of the declaration must appear in the declaration date field when 
 completed by either an arresting or a citing officer. 
 
 6. 230. Other Officer The name of the arresting officer, if different from the name of the officer completing the 
 Notice to Appear, must be stated on the Notice to Appear. This policy was adopted to 
 
 address situations in which there are teams of officers working radar enforcement or aerial 
 
 patrol. This option is not available on the Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear. (See section 6. 231. ) 
 6. 231. Declarant Automated Traffic Enforcement System Citations The name of the government agency or law enforcement representative making the 
 declaration, ﬁViolation was not committed in my presence. The above is declared on 
 
 information and belief and is based on photographic evidence, ﬂ must be stated on the 
 
 Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear. 6. 240. Defendant™s Signature To secure release from arrest, the defendant must give his/her written promise to 
 appear. 23 The defendant™s signature on the defendant™s copy of the citation must be 
 identical to the signature on the copy of the citation filed with the court. The requirement 
 
 for a signed promise to appear does not apply to citations issued for violations recorded 
 
 by an Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear. 6. 250. Time to Appear a) The time specified in a Notice to Appear issued for a traffic offense must be a 
 specific date which is at least 21 days after arrest; the court having jurisdiction over 
 the offense charged may authorize the arresting officer to specify on the Notice to 
 
 Appear that the appearance may be made before the time specified. 
 24 
 b) When a Notice to Appear has been issued for a violation recorded by an automated 
 
 traffic enforcement system, it must be mailed within 15 days of the violation date to 
 
 the current address of the registered owner of the vehicle on file with the Department 
 22 Per Code Civ. Proc. , 
 § 2015. 5. 23 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40504 and Pen. Code, 
 § 853. 6. 24 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40501 (a) . _ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ 11 of Motor Vehicles, with a certificate of mailing obtained as evidence of service. 
 25 The time to appear must be at least ten days after the Notice to Appear is delivered. 
 26 c) The time to appear placed on Notice to Appear for a nontraffic offense must be at 
 
 least 10 days after the date of arrest for a nontraffic violation. (Pen. Code, § 853. 6. ) 
 d) In the case of juveniles, the court having jurisdiction over the offense charged may 
 
 require the arresting officer to indicate on the Notice to Appear ﬁto be notifiedﬂ rather 
 than a specific date. 27 6. 260. Place to Appear The place specified on the Notice to Appear must be one of the following: 
 
 a) Before a magistrate or judge. 
 28 
 b) Before a person authorized to receive a deposit of bail. 29 
 c) Before the juvenile court, juvenile court referee, or juvenile hearing officer. 30 6. 270. Night Court If the court identified in the Notice to Appear holds night sessions, the notice must 
 include a statement advising the defendant. 
 31 6. 280. Legend The lower left corner of the Notice to Appear forms must denote that the form is a 
 Judicial Council form and specify the council™s form number. 
 Chapter 7 DISCRETIONARY LANGUAGE/DATA FIELDS 
 7. 000. In General The discretionary (shaded) areas on the forms (see Appendix) depict language and data 
 fields that are frequently included at the option of the court or law enforcement agency 
 
 (with the consent of the court in which the Notice to Appear is to be filed) . 
 
 
 Because of limited space, not all of the discretionary language and data fields used 
 
 throughout the state can be shown on the sample forms. The following are narrative 
 
 descriptions of several discretionary data fields. 
 25 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40518 (a) . 26 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40518 (b) . 27 Per Veh. Code, 
 § 40501 (b) . 28 Per Veh. Code,

 § 40502 (d) . _ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ 12 7. 010. Bail Statement If the offense is bailable, the magistrate must fix the amount of bail and endorse the 
 following statement on the warrant for arrest. 
 32 
 BAIL: 
 The defendant is to be admitted to bail in the sum of 
 dollars. 
 Judge 
 
 
 Note: The mandatory requirement that the above statement appear on the reverse of the 
 
 court™s copy disrupts the processing of Notice to Appear forms in those automated 
 
 courts` that use the space for cash register validations, automated traffic system 
 
 notations, and notes of court proceedings. These courts use a separate form when issuing 
 
 a warrant for arrest. For those reasons, the warrant for arrest statement is now 
 
 discretionary. 
 7. 020. Defendant™s Race/Ethnicity a) A specific data field for the defendant™s ﬁRaceﬂ or ﬁEthnicityﬂ may be added to the 
 Notice to Appear form. The data field should be located on the same line as other 
 
 physical descriptors. 
 b) The defendant™s ﬁRaceﬂ or ﬁEthnicityﬂ may be indicated in the ﬁOther Descriptionﬂ 
 
 data field. 
 c) If the defendant™s ﬁRaceﬂ or ﬁEthnicityﬂ is to be indicated, the Judicial Council 
 recommends the use of a single alpha charact
 er. Reference: California Department 
 of Justice™s Arrest and Disposition Instruction Manual. 7. 030. Defendant™s Thumbprint a) The defendant™s thumbprint may be placed on the Notice to Appear in situations in 
 which there is a question in the citing officer™s mind as to the true identity of the 
 
 defendant. The court will then have the option of comparing thumbprints in those 
 
 cases where the defendant alleges that another person has committed the cited 
 
 offense. 33 
 b) The Judicial Council recommends that the thumbprint on form TR 120 or TR 130 be 
 
 placed in a one inch square area located on the reverse of the court™s copy in the 
 lower left corner. For citations on forms TR 135 or TR 145, a digitized thumbprint or 
 
 fingerprint may be printed on the defendant™s paper copy of the citation and filed with 
 
 the court as part of the notice to appear. If the defendant™s thumbprint or fingerprint is 
 
 captured electronically as a digital image, but not included as part of the notice to 
 
 appear, the digital image may be retained by the arresting agency for use as provided 
 
 in Penal Code sections 853. 5 and 853. 6 and Vehicle Code sections 40500 and 40504 
 and any other purposes permitted by law.

 § 40500 (a) and Pen. Code, 
 § 853. 6. _ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ 13 c) The thumbprint item does not appear on the 
 Automated Traffic Enforcement System Notice to Appear. Chapter 8 PROHIBITED LANGUAGE/DATA FIELDS 
 8. 010. Defendant™s Social Security Number The defendant™s social security number must not be indicated on the Notice to Appear, 
 unless the social security number is also the driver license number and/or the defendant 
 
 holds a commercial driver license. 
 
 
 To protect an individual™s civil rights, federal statutes allow a very restricted compulsory 
 use of a person™s social security number for the purpose of establishing identity. 
 34 
 Federal statutes do permit an agency having administrative responsibility for driver 
 
 license and motor vehicle registration laws to use a person™s social security number to 
 
 establish that person™s identity as it relates to the laws within the agency™s jurisdiction. 35 
 The California Department of Motor Vehicles re
 quires an individual to disclose his or her social security number in order to obtain a driver license or identification card. 
 36 A number of other states use the individual™s social security number as the driver license 
 
 number.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
