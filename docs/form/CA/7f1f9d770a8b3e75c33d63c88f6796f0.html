      <pre>INFORMATION SHEET FOR NOTICE OF MOTION AND DECLARATION 
FOR JOINDER OF OTHER PARENT IN GOVERNMENTAL ACTION

FL-661-INFO

Please follow these instructions to complete the Notice of Motion and Declaration for Joinder of Other Parent in 
Governmental Action (form FL-661) if you do not have an attorney representing you. Your attorney, if you have one, 
should complete this form.

If this motion is granted, the “Other Parent”  will become a party to this action. Either parent may then raise issues 
concerning support, custody, visitation, and restraining orders. Other issues may not be raised in this action. The local 
child support agency cannot assist you with or negotiate, settle, or contest any issues of custody, visitation, or restraining 
orders. Either parent can go to court to modify the support order, but the local child support agency must first be given 
notice of the hearing date. The other parent can also file an action to enforce the support order but only after giving 
advance notice to the local child support agency.

This form should be used if a parent is receiving child support services through the local child support agency’s 
office, but the parent is not listed as a party in the support order or judgment.  If both parents’ names are listed on 
your most recent support order or judgment as a petitioner/plaintiff, respondent/defendant, or other parent, you do not 
need to complete this motion.  If you do not have a copy of your most recent support order or judgment, you can get one 
from either the court clerk or the local child support agency.

You must file the completed motion with the court clerk. The address of the court clerk is the same as the one shown for 
the superior court on your most recent support order or judgment. You may have to pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford to 
pay the filing fee, contact the court clerk. Keep three copies of the filed motion. Serve one copy on the other parent 
with a blank Responsive Declaration to Motion for Joinder of Other Parent—Consent Order of Joinder (form         
FL-662), serve the second copy of the motion on the local child support agency, and keep the third copy for your
records. You may not serve papers on the other parties. You must have someone who is not a party to the action 
and is 18 years of age or older serve the papers for you. (See Information Sheet for Service of Process (form 
FL-611).)

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
