 order within 30 days with the Secretary of State and the State Registrar and pay the applicable fees. You may write or contact the

Check with the court to determine whether supplemental information is available. 
 For instance, the court may provide you with additional written information identifying the department that handles name and gender change petitions, and the times when petitions are heard. If you are requesting a name change in this petition, you must complete the Order to Show Cause for Change of Name to Conform to Gender Identity (form NC 125/NC 225) , take it to the clerk's office to obtain the judicial officer's signature, and file the original. You do not need to serve this form on anyone. If objections are filed within six weeks of the issuance of that 
 form, the court will set a hearing date and send you and the objectors notice of the date, time, and place. If no objections 
 are filed, the court will make the decision based on the petition you filed. </div>
