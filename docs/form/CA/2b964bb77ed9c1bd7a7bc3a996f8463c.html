      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: JV 596 INFOSealing of Records for Satisfactory Completion of Probation If your case is terminated by the juvenile court after January 1, 2015, because you satisfactorily completed your 
 probation (formal or informal) , or if your case was 
 otherwise dismissed after the petition was filed, in many 
 cases, the court will have dismissed the petition (s) and 
 sealed your records. If the court sealed your records for this 
 reason, you should have received a copy of the sealing 
 order with this form. If the court finds you have not satisfactorily completed your probation, it will not dismiss your case and will not 
 seal your records at termination. If you want to have your 
 records sealed in this situation, you will need to ask the 
 court to seal your records at a later date (see form JV 595 INFO for information about asking the court to 
 seal your records) . The court will not seal your records at the end of your case if you were found to have committed an offense listed in 
 Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 (b) (a violent 
 offense such as murder, rape, or kidnapping, and some 
 offenses involving drugs or weapons) when you were 14 or 
 older unless it was dismissed or reduced to a misdemeanor 
 or a lesser offense not listed in 707 (b) , but unless you were 
 found to have committed one or more of certain sex 
 offenses, you can ask the court to seal your records at age 
 18 (or age 21 if you were committed to the Division of 
 Juvenile Facilities) . Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov Rev. January 1, 2020, Mandatory Form 
 Welfare and Institutions Code, § 786 
 Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5. 840 JV 596 INFO, Page 1 of 2 Sealing of Records for Satisfactory Completion of Probation If a new petition is filed against you for a felony 
 offense, probation can look at what programs you were 
 in but cannot use that information to keep you in 
 juvenile hall or to punish you. How will the court decide if probation is 
 satisfactorily completed? If you have done what you were ordered to do while on 
 probation and have not been found to have committed any 
 further crimes (felonies or misdemeanor crimes involving 
 moral turpitude, such as a sex crime or a crime involving 
 dishonesty) , the court will find that your probation was 
 satisfactorily completed even if you still owe restitution, 
 court ordered fees, and fines, BUT. . . If your records were sealed by the court at termination, 
 the prosecutor and others can look at your record to 
 determine if you are eligible to participate in a deferred 
 entry of judgment or informal supervision program. Ł Ł Who can see your sealed records? In many cases, the court will seal your juvenile records if you satisfactorily complete 
 probation (formal or informal supervision) . If you apply for benefits as a nonminor dependent, the 
 court may see your records. Ł If the juvenile court finds you have committed a felony, 
 your sealed records can be viewed to decide what 
 disposition (sentence) the court should order. Ł If you are arrested for a new offense and the 
 prosecuting attorney asks the court to transfer you to 
 adult court, your record can be reviewed to decide if 
 transfer is appropriate. Ł If you are not allowed to have a gun because of your 
 offense, the Department of Justice can look at your 
 records to make sure you do not buy or own a gun. Ł If you are in foster care, the child welfare agency can 
 look at your records to determine where you should live 
 and what services you need. Ł If your case was dismissed before you became a ward, 
 the prosecutor can look at your records for six months 
 after the dismissal in order to refile the dismissed 
 petition based on new information or evidence. Ł The court will order your court, probation, Department of 
 Justice, and law enforcement agency records sealed for the 
 case the court is closing and earlier cases, if the court 
 determines you are eligible. If you or your attorney ask the 
 court, it can also seal records of other agencies (such as the 
 District Attorney™s office) if it finds that doing so would 
 help you to be rehabilitated. If you have more than one juvenile case and are unsure which records were sealed, ask your attorney or probation 
 officer. Which records will be sealed? Restitution and court fines must still be paid. Even if your records are sealed, you must still pay your 
 restitution and court ordered fines. Your sealed records can 
 be looked at to enforce those orders. If a prosecutor thinks something in your record would 
 be helpful to someone who is charged with a crime in 
 another case, the prosecutor can ask the court to provide 
 that information. If this request is made, the court will 
 let you know. You and your lawyer may object. Ł Do you have to report the offenses in the sealed records on job, school, or other 
 applications? No. Once your records are sealed, the law treats those 
 offenses as if they did not occur and you do not need to 
 report them. However, the military and some federal agencies may not recognize sealing of records and may be 
 aware of your juvenile justice history, even if your records 
 are sealed. If you want to enlist in the military or apply for 
 a job that asks you to provide information about your 
 juvenile records, seek legal advice about this issue. Can employers see your records if they are 
 not sealed? Juvenile records are not allowed to be disclosed to most 
 employers, and employers are not allowed to ask about or 
 consider your juvenile history in most cases. There are 
 exceptions to this rule if you are applying to be a peace 
 officer or to work in health settings. €Also, federal 
 employers may still have access to your juvenile history. € 
 You should seek legal advice if you have questions about 
 what an employer can ask. JV 596 INFOSealing of Records for Satisfactory Completion of Probation Rev. January 1, 2020 JV 596 INFO, Page 2 of 2 Sealing of Records for Satisfactory Completion of Probation NOTE: Even if someone looks at your records in one of 
 these situations, your records will stay sealed and you 
 do not need to ask the court to seal them again. If you want to see your records or allow someone else to see them, you can ask the court to unseal them. Ł</div>
