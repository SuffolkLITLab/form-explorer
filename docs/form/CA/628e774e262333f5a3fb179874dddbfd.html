Notice of Entry of Judgment  

Clerk stamps here when form is filed.

This form tells you the court’s decision (judgment) in this small 
claims case. The date the small claims clerk handed or mailed you this form 
is very important. That date sets the deadline for the parties to take legal steps 
to protect or enforce their rights.

If the court ordered you to pay money, your wages, money, or property 
can be taken, if you do not pay the judgment within 30 days. You may also 
have to pay interest. If the court decided that you owe money because of an 
auto accident, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) can suspend your 
driver’s license.

If you disagree with the judgment, you may have the right to appeal or 
to ask the court to cancel or correct the judgment. To protect these rights, you 
must file papers with the court within 30 days after this notice was mailed or 
handed to you. 

Fill in the court name and street address:
Superior Court of California, County of

Read pages 3 and 4. They explain your rights and responsibilities, 
whether you won or lost the case.

Fill in your case number and case name:
Case Number:

The judgment (decision) in this small claims case was entered on

Case Name:

The judgment cannot be enforced until after the 30-day right to appeal or file a motion to vacate (cancel) or correct

starting (date):                                 and a final payment of: $                             on (date):

interest will be owed on the judgment and the judgment will have been paid in full. 

If any payment is not made in full and on time, the judgment creditor may notify the court to cancel the 
payment plan, and the entire unpaid balance will become due and collectible.

the party signed a minor’s driver’s license application).

The court finds that the defendant’s rights under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act were not prejudiced by 
the entering of a judgment against the defendant because the defendant was not a servicemember or had notice 
and was available to defend this action.

What to Do After the Court Decides Your Small Claims Case 

First, read the court's decisions on pages 1 and 2. They will tell you the court’s judgment in this case. 
Then read this form. It will help you protect or enforce your rights, whether you won or lost the case.

Warning!  You may lose important rights if you do not act within 30 days after the court handed or mailed you 
this Notice of Entry of Judgment. If the court mailed the Notice of Entry of Judgment, the date of mailing is on the 
Clerk's Certificate of Mailing that came with the notice.

If the court ordered the other side to pay you… 
You  are  the  judgment  creditor.  You  must  collect  your 
judgment.  The  court  will  not  collect  it  for  you.  Some  steps 
you can take to collect your money are summarized below. 
For  more  information,  go  to  www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/ 
smallclaims/collectintro.htm.

Important!  The  judgment  debtor  has  30  days  after  the 
Notice of  Entry of Judgment was handed or mailed to him 
or her to appeal or pay or ask the court to cancel or correct 
the  judgment.  You  cannot  take  legal  steps  to  collect  the 
judgment during this time. 

Ask  the  judgment  debtor  to  pay  you  the  money.  If  the 
judgment  debtor  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  judgment  all  at 
once, consider offering to take payments. If your claim was 
for  possession  of  property,  ask  the  judgment  debtor  to 
return the property to you. 

If  the  judgment  debtor  does  not  pay,  you  can  find  out 
about  the  debtor's  income  or  property  that  the  sheriff 
can take to satisfy the judgment. 

•

•

•

If the debtor does not pay within 30 days after the court 
clerk delivered or mailed the Notice of Entry of Judgment, 
the  debtor  must  send  you  Form  SC-133,  Judgment 
Debtor's Statement of Assets. This form will tell you what 
property  the  debtor  has  that  may  be  used  to  pay  the 
judgment.

If the debtor does not send you the completed Form 
SC-133, you can file Form SC-134, Application and Order 
to  Produce  Statement  of  Assets  and  to  Appear  for 
Examination.  In  this  form,  you  can  also  ask  the  court  to 
award  you  your  attorney  fees,  expenses,  and  other 
appropriate relief.

If  the  debtor  does  send  you  Form  SC-133,  you  can 
still  have  the  debtor  come  to  court  to  answer 
questions  about  income  and  property.  To  do  this,  file 
Form EJ-125, Application and Order for Appearance and 
Examination.

If the court ordered you to pay money… 
You are the judgment debtor. The law requires you to 
pay the judgment. You can:

Pay the judgment creditor directly.

Pay the court. (To do this, file Form SC-145, 
Request to Pay Judgment to Court.) Or 

Ask the court to let you make payments. (To do this, 
file Form SC-220, Request to Make Payments.)

• • •

If  any  payment  is  not  made  in  full  and  on  time,  the 
judgment  creditor  may  notify  the  court  to  cancel  the 
payment  plan  and  the  entire  unpaid  balance  will 
become due and collectible.

Warning!  If  you  do  not  pay  the  judgment  or  file  an 
appeal  or  a  motion  to  vacate  (cancel)  or  correct  the 
judgment  within  30  days  after  the  Notice  of  Entry  of 
Judgment  was  handed  or  mailed  to  you,  your  wages, 
money,  and  property  can  be  taken  to  pay  the  claim. 
You may also have to pay interest. If your case involves 
an  auto  accident  on  a  California  highway,  the  Depart- 
ment  of  Motor  Vehicles  (DMV)  can  suspend  your 
driver's license. 

After  you  pay  the  judgment  in  full,  you  can  ask  the 
judgment  creditor  to  file  a  form  saying  the  judgment  is 
paid.  (See  Form  SC-290,  Acknowledgment  of  Satis- 
faction of Judgment.) If the judgment creditor does not 
do this, he or she may have to pay you damages and a 
penalty. 

If  you  disagree  with  the  judgment  ordering  you  to 
pay money and you went to your small claims trial, 
you  can  appeal  that  decision.  (You  cannot  appeal  the 
decision  on  your  own  claim.)  To  do  this,  file  Form 
SC-140,  Notice  of  Appeal,  within  30  days  after  the 
Notice  of  Entry  of  Judgment  was  handed  or  mailed  to 
you. There will be a new trial in the superior court on all 
claims  in  the  case.  Each  side  will  present  evidence 
again.  This  time,  each  side  can  have  a  lawyer  at  the 
trial.

If the court did not award you any money on a claim that you filed… The court’s decision on your 
claim is normally final. You cannot appeal the decision on your own claim, but you may be allowed to ask the court to 
correct a mistake in the judgment.

Notice of Entry of Judgment  
(Small Claims)

If the court ordered you to pay money… 
(continued)

If the court ordered the other side to pay you… 
(continued)

If you disagree with the judgment ordering you 
to pay money, and you did not go to your trial, 
you  can  ask  the  court  to  vacate  (cancel)  the 
judgment.  To  do  this,  file  Form  SC-135,  Notice  of 
Motion 
to  Vacate  Judgment  and  Declaration, 
within  30  days*  after  the  Notice  of  Entry  of 
Judgment was handed or mailed to you. If the court 
denies  your  request,  you    have  until  10  days  from 
the  date  the  notice  of  denial  is  mailed  to  file  an 
appeal. 
*Exception:  If  the  claim  against  you  was  not 
properly  served,  you  have  180  days  from  the  date 
that you found out (or should have found out) about 
the judgment against you to file a request to cancel 
the judgment.

Unless you pay the judgment or file an appeal or 
a  motion  as  discussed  above,  you  must  complete 
Form  SC-133,  Judgment  Debtor's  Statement  of 
Assets, and deliver it to the judgment creditor within 
30  days  after  the  clerk  delivered  or  mailed  the 
Notice of Entry of Judgment.  
Warning! If you do not deliver the completed Form 
SC-133,  the  court  can  order  you  to  pay  attorney 
fees and impose other penalties. 

•

To  obtain  the  judgment  debtor’s  financial  records  from 
another  person  or  a  company  at  a  hearing,  fill  out  Form 
SC-107, Small Claims Subpoena and Declaration, take it 
to  the  small  claims  court  clerk  to  be  issued,  and  then 
have it served. 

Once  you  know  about  the  judgment  debtor's  income 
and property, you can ask the sheriff to take that property 
to  pay  you.  (Property  that  may  be  taken  includes  wages, 
bank accounts, automobiles, business property, and rental 
income.) To do this, fill out and ask the court clerk to issue 
Form EJ-130, Writ of Execution. Then, take the form to the 
sheriff's office with a description of the debtor's property. 

You can also put a lien on the judgment debtor's house 
or  other  real  estate.  To  do  this,  fill  out  and  ask  the  court 
clerk  to  issue  Form  EJ-001,  Abstract  of  Judgment—Civil 
and  Small  Claims.  Then,  take  or  mail  the  Abstract  to  the 
county  recorder's  office  in  the  county  where  you  think  the 
debtor  owns  real  property.  If  the  judgment  debtor  sells, 
refinances,  or  buys  real  property  in  that  county,  your 
judgment should be paid from the debtor's funds. 

After the judgment has been paid in full, you must fill out 
an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment and file it 
with  the  court  clerk.  If  an  Abstract  of  Judgment  has  not 
been  recorded,  you  may  use  Form  SC-290.  If  an  abstract 
has been recorded, use Form EJ-100. 

Warning!  If  you  do  not  file  an  Acknowledgment  of 
Satisfaction  of  Judgment,  you  may  have  to  pay  the 
judgment debtor damages and a penalty.

You may need to pay fees to the court, the county recorder's office, or the 
sheriff for filing, issuing, and recording papers and doing the other things 
discussed above. Sometimes, you can ask the court to order the other side 
to repay you for these expenses.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
