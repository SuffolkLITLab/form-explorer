 writ proceedings in the different courts that consider 
 request for writs in small claims cases. 
 
 
 This information sheet does NOT provide information 
 
 about motions to vacate a judgment or appeals in small 
 claims cases, or about requests for writs on all types of 
 rulings in a small claims case. 
 For information about making a motion to cancel or 
 correct a judgment in small claims court, please see 
 
 Code of Civil Procedure sections 116. 720Œ116. 745 
 and Notice of Motion to Vacate Judgment and

 A writ is an order from a higher court telling a lower 
 
 court to do something the law says the lower court must 
 do, or not to do something the law says the lower court 
 does not have the power to do. In writ proceedings in the 
 
 appellate division, the lower court is the small claims 
 
 court that took the action or issued the order being 
 challenged. In this information sheet, we call the lower court the 
 ﬁsmall claims court. ﬂ
 
 
 Yes. There are three main kinds of writs: 
 Writs of mandate (somet
 imes called ﬁmandamusﬂ) , 
 which are orders telling the small claims court to do 
 
 something. 
 Writs of prohibition, which are orders telling the 
 small claims court 
 not to do something. 
 Writs of review (sometimes called ﬁcertiorariﬂ) , 
 which are orders telling the small claims court that a 
 
 judge in the appellate division will review certain

 Small Claims Cases SC 300 INFO kinds of actions already taken by the small claims 
 court. 
 There are laws (statutes) that you should read concerning 
 
 each type of writ: see California Code of Civil Procedure 
 
 sections 1084Œ1097 about writs
 of mandate, sections 
 1102Œ1105 about writs of pr
 ohibition, and sections 
 1067Œ1077 about writs of review. 
 No. Generally, in an 
 appeal, the higher court 
 must consider the parties™ arguments and decide whether the 
 
 trial court made the legal error claimed by the appealing 
 
 party and whether the trial court™s decision should be 
 
 overturned based on that error (this is called a ﬁdecision 
 on the meritsﬂ) . In choosing to go to small claims court, 
 the party filing a claim agreed 
 to give up the right to an 
 appeal in exchange for a less formal and less expensive 
 way of proceeding. The defendant in a small claim case 
 
 does have the right to an appeal, in the form of a new 
 
 trial, and if the defendant asks for one, the higher court 
 must allow a new trial on all the claims in the case, with 
 each side presenting evidence. 
 
 
 In a writ proceeding, the appellate division judge is not required to make a decision on the merits or hold a new 
 trial. Even if the small claims court made a legal error, 
 the appellate division judge can decide not to consider 
 
 that error, and usually will not. Most requests for writs 
 
 are denied without a decision on the merits (this is called 
 
 a ﬁsummary denialﬂ) . Because of this, a writ proceeding 
 
 is often called a proceeding for ﬁ
 extraordinaryﬂ relief, while a judgment by the small claims court, or possibly a 
 new trial at superior court for the defendant, is the 
 
 ordinary way that small claims court cases end. 
 No. A writ proceeding is NOT a new trial. 
 The appellate division judge will not consider new evidence, 
 such as the testimony of new witnesses. Instead, if he or 
 she does not summarily deny the request for a writ, the 
 appellate division judge reviews what happened in the 
 
 small claims court and the small claims court™s ruling to 
 
 see if the small claims court made the legal error claimed 
 
 by the person asking for the writ. In conducting this 
 review, the appellate division judge presumes that the 
 small claims court™s ruling is correct; the person who 
 requests the writ must show the appellate division judge 
 that the small claims court made the legal error the 
 
 person is claiming. 
 
 
 No. 
 Writs are not generally granted regarding small claims 
 cases. The small claims courts exists to provide a speedy 
 and inexpensive way for a party to obtain a judgment. 
 This works in part by limiting what a party can do after 
 
 the small claims court makes its rulings. 
 When a person or business chooses to make a claim in 
 
 small claims court, rather than filing in a different level 
 of the superior court, that partyŠthe plaintiffŠgives up 
 the right to ask for an appeal of the small claims court™s 
 
 rulings. This is a trade off for the faster, less formal, and 
 
 less expensive court proceedings. As a result, appellate 
 courts have been reluctant to consider requests for writs 
 in small claims cases. 
 A defendant in a small claims case does have the right to 
 
 appeal the initial small claims court decisions and get a 
 
 new trial in the superior court. Because the defendant 
 
 already has this right to have the case heard again, 
 
 including putting on the evidence and being represented by an attorney if defendant 
 wants to hire one, appellate 
 courts are unlikely to see any need for a writ instead. 
 However, the appellate division judge does have the 
 
 discretion to consider a request for an extraordinary writ 
 
 challenging a ruling in a small claims case. For example, 
 the judge may do so if he or she considers the issue 
 raised to be of statewide importance, or in order to make 
 
 sure that the small claims division is generally being 
 
 consistent in how it is acting under the law. Not every 
 
 legal or factual error made by a small claims judge will 
 
 form a ground for the granting of a writ. 
 Writs can only address certain legal errors. 
 Writs can only address the following types of legal errors made by 
 
 a small claims court: 
 The small claims court has a legal duty to act but: 
 o Refuses to act 
 o Has not done what the law says it must do 
 Is a writ proceeding the same as 
 an appeal? 
 Is a writ proceeding a new trial? 
 Can a writ be used to address 
 any errors made by a small claims court?

 The small claims court has performed or says it is 
 going to perform a judicial function (like deciding a 
 
 person™s rights under law in a particular case) in a 
 
 way that the court does not have the legal power to 
 do. 
 No. Different courts have the power (called 
 ﬁjurisdictionﬂ) to consider requests for writs in different 
 
 types of cases. Requests for writs in small claims cases 
 may be considered in one of three different ways, 
 depending on the stage of the case: 
 
 Requests for writs relating to actions of the 
 small claims division 
 other
 than postjudgment 
 enforcement orders are considered by a single 
 
 judge in the appellate division. This covers 
 requests for writs on any rulings relating to the 
 initial small claims trial, including the judgment. 
 
 Requests for writs relating to superior court 
 actions in small claims cases on appeal are not 
 
 considered by the appellate division, but by the 
 Court of Appeal. 
 Requests for writs relating to the enforcement of a judgment in a small cl
 aims case, whether the judgment was issued at the small claims hearing 
 
 or at a new trial in the superior court, are 
 considered by the appellate division. 
 If you are asking for the writ, you are called the 
 
 PETITIONER. You should read ﬁInformation for the 
 Petitioner, ﬂ beginning on the right side of this page. 
 
 The court the petitioner is asking to be ordered to do or 
 
 not to do something is called the RESPONDENT. In 
 
 writ proceedings challenging rulings in small claims 
 cases, the small claims court is the respondent. 
 Any other party in the small claims court case who 
 
 would be affected by a ruling regarding the request for a 
 
 writ is a REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. If you are a real party in interest, you should read ﬁInformation for a Real 
 Party in Interest, ﬂ beginning on page 8. 
 
 You do not 
 have
 to have a lawyer; you are allowed to 
 represent yourself in a writ proceeding in the appellate 
 division. But writ proceedings can be very complicated 
 
 and you will have to follow the same rules that lawyers 
 
 have to follow. If you have any questions about the writ 
 
 procedures, you should talk to a lawyer. In limited civil 
 cases and infraction cases, you must hire a lawyer at 
 your own expense if you want one (the court cannot 
 
 provide one) . You can get information about finding a 
 
 lawyer on the California Courts Online Self Help Center 
 
 at www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp lowcosthelp. htm. 
 You may also get help from the small claims advisors in your 
 county if available. Ask the court how to contact them or 
 
 look for contact information at 
 www. courts. ca. gov /selfhelp advisors. htm. This part of the information sheet is written for the 
 
 petitionerŠthe party asking for the writ. It explains 
 
 some of the rules and procedures relating to asking for a 
 
 writ. The information may also be helpful to a real party 
 in interest. There is more information for a real party in 
 interest starting on page 8 of this information sheet. 
 
 PartiesŠthe plaintiff or defendantŠ are usually the only 
 
 ones that ask for writs challenging small claims court 
 
 rulings. However, in most cases, a person who was not a 
 
 party does have the legal right to ask for a writ if that 
 
 person has a ﬁbeneficial interestﬂ in the small claims 
 
 court™s ruling. A ﬁbeneficial interestﬂ means that the 
 person has a specific right or interest affected by the 
 ruling that goes beyond the general rights or interests the 
 
 public may have in the ruling. 
 
 To ask for a writ you must serve and file a petition for a 
 writ (see below for an explanation of how to ﬁserve and 
 fileﬂ a petition) . A petition is a formal request that the Can the appellate division consider a

 Small Claims Cases SC 300 INFO appellate division issue a writ. A petition for a writ explains to the appellate division what happened in the 
 small claims court, what legal error you (the petitioner) 
 
 believe the small claims court made, why you have no 
 other adequate remedy at law, and what order you are 
 
 requesting the appellate division to make. 
 
 If you are represented by a lawyer, your lawyer will 
 prepare your petition for a writ. If you are not 
 represented by a lawyer, you must use 
 Petition for Writ 
 (Small Claims) (form SC 300) to prepare your petition. 
 You can get it at any courthouse or county law library or 
 
 online at www. courts. ca. gov/forms. This form asks you 
 to fill in the information that needs to be in a writ 
 petition. a. Description of your interest in the small 
 claims court™s ruling Your petition needs to tell the appellate division judge 
 why you have a right to ask for a writ in the case. As 
 
 discussed above, usually only a person who was a party 
 
 in the small claims court case asks for a writ challenging 
 
 a ruling in that case. If you were a party in the small 
 
 claims court case, say that in your petition. If you were 
 not a party, you will need to
 describe what ﬁbeneficial 
 interestﬂ you have in the small claims court™s ruling. A 
 
 ﬁbeneficial interestﬂ means th
 at you have a specific right 
 or interest affected by the ruling that goes beyond the 
 
 general rights or interests the public may have in the 
 ruling. To show the appellate division judge that you 
 have a beneficial interest in the ruling you want to 
 
 challenge, you must describe
 how the ruling will affect you in a direct and negative way. 
 
 b. Description of the legal error you believe the 
 small claims court made Your petition will need to tell the appellate division 
 judge what legal error you be
 lieve the small claims court made. Not every mistake a small claims court might 
 make can be addressed by a writ. You must show that 
 the small claims court made one of the following types 
 
 of legal errors: The small claims court has a legal duty to act but: 
 o Refuses to act 
 o Has not done what the law says it must do 
 o Has acted in a way the law says it does not have 
 the power to act 
 The small claims court has performed or says it is 
 going to perform a judicial function (like deciding a 
 
 person™s rights under law in a particular case) in a 
 
 way that the court does not have the legal power to 
 do. 
 To show the appellate division judge that the small 
 
 claims court made one of these legal errors, you will 
 
 need to: Show that the small claims court has the legal duty 
 or the power to act or not act in a particular way. 
 
 You will need to tell the appellate division judge 
 
 what legal authorityŠwhat constitutional provision, 
 
 statute, rule, or published court decisionŠ
 establishes the small claims court™s legal duty or 
 power to act or not act in that way. 
 Show the appellate division judge that the small 
 claims court has not acted in the way that this legal 
 
 authority says the court is required to act. You will 
 need to tell the appellate division judge what 
 happened in the small claims court that shows that 
 
 the small claims court did not act in the way it was 
 
 required to. If the petition raises an issue that would 
 
 require the appellate division judge to consider what 
 was said in the small claims court, you will need to 
 write a complete and accurate summary of what was 
 
 said by you and others, including the court, that is 
 
 relevant to your request for a writ. 
 You can provide this information and the summary 
 of what was said at item 10 of the petition and, as 
 instructed there, you can add additional pages if 
 
 more room is needed. Note that you will be 
 
 providing this information, and everything in the 
 
 petition, under penalty of perjury. 
 c. Description of why you need the writ 
 One of the most important parts of your petition is 
 
 explaining to the appellate division why you need the 
 writ you have requested. Remember, the appellate 
 division judge does not have to grant your petition just 
 
 because the small claims court made an error. You must 
 
 convince the appellate division that it is important for it 
 
 to issue the writ.

 Small Claims Cases SC 300 INFO Your petition needs to show that a writ is the only way 
 to fix the small claims cour
 t™s error. To convince the 
 court you need the writ, you will need to show the 
 
 appellate division judge that you have no way to fix the 
 
 small claims court™s error ot
 her than through a writ (this 
 is called having ﬁno adequa
 te remedy at lawﬂ) . 
 This will be hard to show if the small claims court™s 
 ruling can be appealed and a new trial held. If you are a 
 
 defendant and the ruling you are challenging can be 
 
 appealed, the appellate division will generally consider 
 this new trial to be a good enough way to fix the small 
 claims court™s ruling (an ﬁadequate remedyﬂ) . You will 
 need to show the appellate division judge how you will 
 
 be harmed by the small claims court™s error in a way that 
 
 cannot be fixed by the new trial if the appellate division 
 
 judge does not issue the writ (this is called ﬁirreparableﬂ 
 injury or harm) . For example, the harm you want to 
 prevent may happen before the new trial can be held. 
 
 
 Even if you cannot appeal the ruling you are objecting 
 
 to, the appellate division judge still does not have to 
 
 grant the petition. As described above, small claims 
 decisions are meant to be speedy and inexpensive, so 
 appellate review is generally not granted in these cases. 
 
 You will need to explain why your case should be 
 
 treated differently. 
 
 d. Description of the order you want the 
 appellate division to make 
 Your petition needs to describe what you are asking the appellate division judge to order the small claims court 
 
 to do or not do. Writ petitions usually ask that the small 
 claims court be ordered to cancel (ﬁvacateﬂ) its ruling, 
 issue a new ruling, or not ta
 ke any steps to enforce its 
 ruling. If you want the appellate division judge to order the 
 
 small claims court not to do anything more until the 
 appellate division judge decides whether to grant the 
 
 writ you are requesting, you must ask for a ﬁstay. ﬂ If you 
 
 want a stay, you should first ask the small claims court 
 
 for a stay. You should tell the appellate division judge 
 whether you asked the small claims court for a stay. If 
 you did not ask the small claims court for a stay, you 
 
 should tell the appellate division judge why you did not 
 
 do this. This information is requested in the petition 
 
 form. 
 
 If you ask the appellate division judge for a stay, make 
 sure you also check the ﬁStay requestedﬂ box on the first 
 page of the Petition for Writ (Small Claims) 
 (form SC-
 300) and complete item 12 c on that form. 
 e. Verifying the petition 
 Petitions for writs must be ﬁverified. ﬂ This means that 
 the petitioner (or in certain 
 circumstances the petitioner™s 
 attorney) must declare under penalty of perjury that the 
 
 facts stated in the petition are true and correct, must sign 
 
 the petition, and must indicate the date that the petition 
 was signed. On the last page of the Petition for Writ 
 (Small Claims) (form SC 300) , there is a place for you to 
 verify your petition. 
 
 
 Yes. Along with the petition, you must serve and file 
 
 documents showing what happened in the small claims 
 
 court (see below for an explanation of how to serve and 
 file the petition and other documents) . Because the 
 appellate division judge was not there in the small 
 claims court, copies of certain documents from that court 
 
 that show what happened must be sent to the appellate 
 
 division judge. These are called ﬁsupporting 
 
 documents. ﬂ You must also ser
 ve any other party in this 
 case, the real party in interest, with a copy of this form

 Copies of documents from the small claims court. 
 Copies of the following documents from the small

 circumstances making the documents unavailable. 
 
 
 Format of the supporting documents. 
 Supporting 
 documents must be put in the format required by rule 
 8. 972 of the California Rules of Court. You should 
 
 carefully read rule 8. 972. You can get a copy of rule 
 
 8. 972 at any courthouse or county law library or online 
 
 at www. courts. ca. gov/rules. 
 
 Yes. There are laws (statutes) that require that certain 
 kind of rulings may only be challenged using a writ 
 proceeding. These are called ﬁstatutory writsﬂ and the 
 
 statute usually sets the deadline for serving and filing the 
 
 petition. For example, a writ challenging a ruling on a 
 
 motion to disqualify a judge (see California Code of 
 
 Civil Procedure section 170. 3 (d) ) must be filed within 
 10 days after notice to the parties of the decision. You 
 will need to check whether there is a statute providing a 
 
 deadline for filing a challenge to the specific ruling you 
 
 are challenging. (You can find copies of statutes at any 
 
 county law library or online at 
 leginfo. legislature. ca. gov 
 /faces/codes. xhtml
 ) . 
 If there is not a statute specifically providing for a writ 
 
 proceeding to challenge a particular ruling, or if the 
 statute does not set a deadline, you should file the 
 
 petition as soon as possible and not later than 30 days 
 after the court makes the ruling that you are challenging 
 in the petition. While there is no absolute deadline for 
 filing these petitions, writ petitions are usually used 
 when it is urgent that the small claims court™s error be 
 
 fixed. Remember, the appellate division judge is not 
 required to grant your petition even if the small claims 
 court made an error. If you delay in filing your petition, 
 
 it may make the appellate division judge think that it is 
 
 not really urgent that the small claims court™s error be 
 
 fixed and the appellate division judge may deny your 
 
 petition. If there are extraord
 inary circumstances that 
 delayed the filing of your petition, you should explain 
 these circumstances to the appellate division judge in 
 
 your petition. 
 
 
 Rule 8. 972 (d) requires that the petition with the attached 
 supporting documents, along with a copy of this form, 
 
 be served on any named real party in interest and that the 
 
 petition be served on the respondent small claims court. 
 
 ﬁServingﬂ a petition on a party means that you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a party 
 to the caseŠso not youŠmail or deliver (ﬁserveﬂ) 
 
 the petition to the real party in interest and the 
 
 respondent court in the way required by law. 
 Make a record that the petition has been served. This 
 record is called a ﬁproof of service. ﬂ 
 Proof of Service 
 (Appellate Division) (form APP 109) can be used to 
 make this record. The proof of service must show 
 
 who served the petition, who was served with the 
 petition, how the petition was served (by mail or in 
 person) , and the date the petition was served. 
 
 You can get more information about how to serve court 
 
 documents and proof of service from 
 What Is Proof of 
 Service? (form APP 109 INFO) and on the California 
 Courts Online Self Help Center at 
 www. courts. ca. gov 
 /selfhelp serving. htm. 
 To file a petition for a writ, you must bring or mail the 
 original petition, including the supporting documents 
 and the proof of service, to the clerk for the appellate 
 division of the superior court that made the ruling you 
 
 are challenging. If the superior court has more than one 
 
 courthouse location, you should call the clerk at the 
 
 courthouse where the ruling you are challenging was 
 made to ask where to file your petition. 
 
 You should make a copy of all the documents you are 
 
 planning to file for your own records before you file 
 
 them with the court. It is a good idea to bring or mail an 
 
 extra copy of the petition to the clerk when you file your 
 original and ask the clerk to stamp this copy to show that 
 the original has been filed. 
 
 Yes. You should ask the clerk for the appellate division 
 where you are filing the petition what this fee is. If you 
 cannot afford to pay this filing fee, you can ask the court 
 
 to waive this fee. To do this, you must fill out a 
 Request

 Small Claims Cases SC 300 INFO to Waive Court Fees (form FW 001) . You can get form 
 FW 001 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at www. courts. ca. gov/forms. You can file this application either before you file your petition or with 
 
 your petition. The court will re
 view this application and decide whether to waive the filing fee. 
 Within 10 days after you serve and file your petition, the 
 
 respondent or any real party in
 interest can serve and file 
 a preliminary opposition to the petition. 
 The appellate division judge does not have to wait for an 
 
 opposition before acting on a petition for a writ, 
 
 however. Without waiting, the appellate division judge 
 
 can: a. Issue a stay. 
 
 b. Summarily deny the petition. 
 
 
 c. Issue an alternative writ or order to show cause. 
 
 d. Notify the parties that he or she is considering 
 issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance. 
 
 e. Issue a peremptory writ in
 the first instance if such relief was expressly requested in the petition. 
 Read below for more information about these options. 
 a. Stay of small claims court proceedings 
 A stay is an order from the appellate division judge 
 telling the small claims court not to do anything more 
 until the appellate division judge decides whether to 
 
 grant your petition. A stay puts the small claims court 
 
 proceedings on temporary hold. 
 
 b. Summary denial 
 A ﬁsummary denialﬂ means that the appellate division 
 
 judge denies the petition without deciding whether the 
 
 small claims court made the legal error claimed by the 
 petitioner or whether the writ requested by the petitioner 
 should be issued based on that error. No reasons need to 
 
 be given for a summary denial. Most petitions for writs 
 
 are denied in this way. 
 c. Alternative writ or order to show cause 
 An ﬁalternative writﬂ is an order telling the small claims 
 
 court either to do what the petitioner has requested in the 
 
 petition (or some modified form of what the petitioner 
 
 requested) or to show the appellate division judge why 
 
 the small claims court should not be ordered to do what 
 the petitioner requested. An ﬁo
 rder to show causeﬂ is similar; it is an order telling the small claims court to 
 
 show the appellate division judge why the small claims 
 
 court should not be ordered to do what the petitioner 
 
 requested in the petition (or some modified form of what 
 the petitioner requested) . The appellate division judge 
 will issue an alternative writ or an order to show cause 
 only if the petitioner has shown that he or she has no 
 
 adequate remedy at law and the appellate division judge 
 
 has decided that the petitioner may have shown that the 
 small claims court made a legal error that needs to be 
 fixed. 
 
 If the appellate division judge issues an alternative writ 
 
 and the small claims court does what the petitioner 
 
 requested (or a modified form of what the petitioner 
 requested as ordered by the appellate division judge) , 
 then no further action by the appellate division judge is 
 
 needed and the appellate division may dismiss the 
 
 petition. 
 If the small claims court does not comply with an 
 alternative writ, however, or if the appellate division 
 
 judge issues an order to show cause, then the respondent 
 
 court or a real party in interest can file a response to the 
 
 appellate division judge™s order (called a ﬁreturnﬂ) that 
 
 explains why the small claims court should not be 
 ordered to do what the petitioner requested. The return 
 must be served and filed within the time specified by the 
 
 appellate division judge or, if no time is specified, within 
 
 30 days from the date the alternative writ or order to 
 
 show cause was issued. The petitioner will then have an 
 opportunity to serve and file a reply within 15 days after 
 the return is filed. The appellate division judge may set 
 
 the matter for oral argument. When all the papers have 
 
 been served and filed (or the time to serve and file them 
 
 has passed) and any oral argument is completed, the 
 appellate division will decide the case. 
 d. Peremptory writ in the first instance

 Small Claims Cases SC 300 INFO has requested (or some modified form of what the 
 petitioner requested) that is issued without the appellate division judge first issuing an alternative writ or order to 
 
 show cause. It is very rare for the appellate division 
 
 judge to issue a peremptory wr
 it in the first instance, and 
 this will not be done unless the respondent and real 
 
 parties in interest have received notice that the judge 
 might do so, either through the petitioner expressly 
 asking for such relief in the petition or by the judge 
 
 giving the respondent court and any real party in interest 
 
 notice and a chance to file an opposition. 
 
 The respondent court or a real party in interest can file a 
 response to the appellate division judge™s notice (called 
 
 an ﬁoppositionﬂ) that explains why the small claims 
 
 court should not be ordered to do what the petitioner has 
 
 requested. The opposition must be served and filed 
 within the time specified by the appellate division judge 
 or, if no time is specified, within 30 days from the date 
 
 the notice was issued. The petitioner will then have a 
 chance to serve and file a reply within 15 days after the 
 
 opposition is filed. The appellate division judge may 
 
 then set the matter for oral argument. When all the papers have been served and filed (or the time to serve 
 and file them has passed) and any oral argument is 
 
 completed, the appellate division judge will decide the 
 
 case. 
 This part of the information sheet is written for a real 
 
 party in interestŠa party from the small claims court 
 
 case other than the petitioner who will be affected by a 
 ruling on a petition for a writ. It explains some of the 
 rules and procedures relating to responding to a petition 
 
 for a writ. The information may also be helpful to the 
 petitioner. 
 
 
 You do not 
 have to do anything. The Code of Civil 
 Procedure and California Rules of Court give you the 
 
 right to file a preliminary opposition to a petition for a 
 writ within 10 days after the petition is served and filed, 
 but you are not required to do this. The appellate 
 division judge can take certa
 in actions without waiting for any opposition, including: 
 Summarily denying the petition 
 Issuing an alternative writ or order to show cause 
 Notifying the parties that the judge is considering 
 issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance 
 Issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance if such 
 relief was expressly requested in the petition. 
 Read the response in section for more information 
 
 about these options. 
 
 Most petitions for writs are summarily denied, often 
 within a few days after they are filed. If you have not 
 already received something from the appellate division 
 
 judge saying what action the judge is taking on the 
 
 petition, it is a good idea to call the appellate division to 
 
 see if the petition has been denied before you decide 
 
 whether and how to respond. 
 This would also be a good time to talk to a lawyer. You 
 
 do not 
 have to have a lawyer; you are allowed to 
 represent yourself in a writ proceeding in the appellate 
 
 division. But writ proceedings can be very complicated 
 and you will have to follow the same rules that lawyers 
 have to follow. If you have any questions about writ 
 
 proceedings or about whether and how you should 
 
 respond to a writ petition, you should talk to a lawyer. 
 
 You must hire a lawyer at your own expense if you want 
 
 one (the court cannot provide one) . You can get 
 information about finding a lawyer on the California 
 Courts Online Self Help Center at 
 www. courts. ca. gov 
 /selfhelp lowcosthelp. htm. You may also get help from 
 the small claims advisors in your county if available. 
 
 Ask the court how to contact them or look for contact 
 information at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp advisors. htm
 . 
 If the petition has not already been summarily denied, 
 
 you may, but are not required to, serve and file a 
 
 preliminary opposition to the petition within 10 days 
 after the petition was served and filed. The appellate 
 division judge will seldom grant a writ without first 
 
 issuing an alternative writ, an order to show cause, or a 
 notice that the judge is considering issuing a peremptory 
 
 writ. In all these circumstances, you will get notice from 
 
 the court and have a chance to file a response. Note that 
 I have received a copy of a petition for 
 a writ in a case in which I am a party.

 Small Claims Cases SC 300 INFO the appellate division judge may issue a peremptory writ 
 without notice if the petitioner expressly asked the court 
 to do so in the petition, that is, asked the court to issue a 
 
 peremptory writ in the first instance. If the petitioner did 
 
 that, you may want to consider whether to file a 
 
 preliminary opposition, to 
 explain why you believe the 
 small claims court made no legal error and why the 
 petitioner is not entitled to a writ. 
 
 If you decide to file a preliminary opposition, you must 
 
 serve that preliminary opposition on all the other parties 
 
 to the writ proceeding. ﬁServing and filingﬂ an opposition means that you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a party 
 to the caseŠso not youŠmail or deliver (ﬁserveﬂ) 
 
 the preliminary opposition to the other parties in the 
 
 way required by law. 
 Make a record that the preliminary opposition has 
 been served. This record is called a ﬁproof of 
 service. ﬂ Proof of Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form 
 APP 109) can be used to make this record. The 
 
 proof of service must show who served the 
 preliminary opposition, who was served with the 
 preliminary opposition, how the preliminary 
 
 opposition was served (by mail or in person) , and 
 
 the date the preliminary opposition was served. 
 File the original preliminary opposition and the 
 proof of service with the appellate division. You

 Yes. Unless the small claims court has already done 
 what the alternative writ told it to do, you should serve 
 
 and file a response called a ﬁreturn. ﬂ 
 
 
 As explained above, the appellate division judge will issue an alternative writ or an order to show cause only 
 if the appellate division judge has decided that the 
 petitioner may have shown that the small claims court 
 
 made a legal error that needs 
 to be fixed. An ﬁalternative 
 writﬂ is an order telling the small claims court either to 
 do what the petitioner has requested in the petition (or some modified form of what the petitioner requested) or 
 
 to show the appellate division judge why the small 
 
 claims court should not be ordered to do what the 
 
 petitioner requested. An ﬁorder to show causeﬂ is 
 
 similar; it is an order telling the small claims court to 
 show the appellate division judge why the small claims

 judge issues an order to show cause, then the small

 A return is your argument to the appellate division judge 
 
 about why the small claims 
 court should not be ordered 
 to do what the petitioner has requested. If you are 
 
 represented by a lawyer in the writ proceeding, your 
 lawyer will prepare your return. If you are not

 appellate division judge will seldom issue a peremptory
