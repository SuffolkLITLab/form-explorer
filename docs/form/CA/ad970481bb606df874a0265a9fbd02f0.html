What is a writ? 

 writ is an order from a higher court telling a lower 
court to do something the law says the lower court must 
do, or not to do something the law says the lower court 
does not have the power to do. In writ proceedings in the 
appellate division, the lower court is the small claims 
court that took the action or issued the order being 
challenged.  

n this information sheet, we call the lower court the 
“small claims court.” 

Are there different kinds of writs? 

es. There are three main kinds of writs: 

  Writs of mandate (sometimes called “mandamus”), 
which are orders telling the small claims court to do 
something. 

  Writs of prohibition, which are orders telling the 

small claims court not to do something. 

  Writs of review (sometimes called “certiorari”), 

which are orders telling the small claims court that a 
judge in the appellate division will review certain

GENERAL INFORMATION 

 

What does this information sheet cover? 

his information sheet tells you about writ 

proceedings—proceedings in which a person is asking 
for a writ of mandate, prohibition, or review—in small 
claims cases. Please read this information sheet before 
you fill out Petition for Writ (Small Claims) (form SC-
300). This information sheet does not cover everything 
you may need to know about writ proceedings. It is only 
meant to give you a general idea of the writ process. To 
learn more, you should read the California Rules of 
Court identified below, which set out the procedures for 
writ proceedings in the different courts that consider 
request for writs in small claims cases.  

his information sheet does NOT provide information 
about motions to vacate a judgment or appeals in small 
claims cases, or about requests for writs on all types of 
rulings in a small claims case.  

  For information about making a motion to cancel or 
correct a judgment in small claims court, please see 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 116.720–116.745 
and Notice of Motion to Vacate Judgment and 
Declaration (form SC-135). 
 

  For information about appealing a small claims 

judgment, which you can only do if you disagree 
with a judgment ordering you to pay money, please 
see Code of Civil Procedure sections 116.710, 
116.750–116.795, rules 8.950–8.966 of the 
California Rules of Court and What to Do After the 
Court Decides Your Small Claims Case (form SC-
200-INFO). 

hile this information sheet provides general 
information about writs and writ procedures, the 
procedures it describes do NOT apply to writs in all 
small claims cases. These procedures only apply to 
requests for writs relating to actions of the small claims 
court other than postjudgment enforcement actions. 
These requests will be considered by a single judge from 
the appellate division of the superior court. The 
procedures are set out in more detail in rules 8.970–
8.977 of the California Rules of Court.

               Small Claims Cases 

small claims court’s ruling is correct; the person who 
requests the writ must show the appellate division judge 
that the small claims court made the legal error the 
person is claiming. 

Can a writ be used to address any 
errors made by a small claims court? 

rits are not generally granted regarding small claims 
cases. The small claims courts exists to provide a speedy 
and inexpensive way for a party to obtain a judgment. 
This works in part by limiting what a party can do after 
the small claims court makes its rulings.   

hen a person or business chooses to make a claim in 
small claims court, rather than filing in a different level 
of the superior court, that party—the plaintiff—gives up 
the right to ask for an appeal of the small claims court’s 
rulings. This is a trade-off for the faster, less formal, and 
less expensive court proceedings. As a result, appellate 
courts have been reluctant to consider requests for writs 
in small claims cases.  

 defendant in a small claims case does have the right to 

appeal the initial small claims court decisions and get a 
new trial in the superior court. Because the defendant 
already has this right to have the case heard again, 
including putting on the evidence and being represented 
by an attorney if defendant wants to hire one, appellate 
courts are unlikely to see any need for a writ instead. 

owever, the appellate division judge does have the 
discretion to consider a request for an extraordinary writ 
challenging a ruling in a small claims case. For example, 
the judge may do so if he or she considers the issue 
raised to be of statewide importance, or in order to make 
sure that the small claims division is generally being 
consistent in how it is acting under the law. Not every 
legal or factual error made by a small claims judge will 
form a ground for the granting of a writ.

kinds of actions already taken by the small claims 
court. 

here are laws (statutes) that you should read concerning 
each type of writ: see California Code of Civil Procedure 
sections 1084–1097 about writs of mandate, sections 
1102–1105 about writs of prohibition, and sections 
1067–1077 about writs of review. 

 

Is a writ proceeding the same as 
an appeal? 

o. Generally, in an appeal, the higher court must 

consider the parties’ arguments and decide whether the 
trial court made the legal error claimed by the appealing 
party and whether the trial court’s decision should be 
overturned based on that error (this is called a “decision 
on the merits”). In choosing to go to small claims court, 
the party filing a claim agreed to give up the right to an 
appeal in exchange for a less formal and less expensive 
way of proceeding. The defendant in a small claim case 
does have the right to an appeal, in the form of a new 
trial, and if the defendant asks for one, the higher court 
must allow a new trial on all the claims in the case, with 
each side presenting evidence.   

n a writ proceeding, the appellate division judge is not 
required to make a decision on the merits or hold a new 
trial. Even if the small claims court made a legal error, 
the appellate division judge can decide not to consider 
that error, and usually will not. Most requests for writs 
are denied without a decision on the merits (this is called 
a “summary denial”). Because of this, a writ proceeding 
is often called a proceeding for “extraordinary” relief, 
while a judgment by the small claims court, or possibly a 
new trial at superior court for the defendant, is the 
ordinary way that small claims court cases end. 

Is a writ proceeding a new trial?

No. A writ proceeding is NOT a new trial. The 
appellate division judge will not consider new evidence, 
such as the testimony of new witnesses. Instead, if he or 
she does not summarily deny the request for a writ, the 
appellate division judge reviews what happened in the 
small claims court and the small claims court’s ruling to 
see if the small claims court made the legal error claimed 
by the person asking for the writ. In conducting this 
review, the appellate division judge presumes that the

Party in Interest,” beginning on page 8. 

 

Do I need a lawyer to represent me in 
a writ proceeding? 

ou do not have to have a lawyer; you are allowed to 
represent yourself in a writ proceeding in the appellate 
division. But writ proceedings can be very complicated 
and you will have to follow the same rules that lawyers 
have to follow. If you have any questions about the writ 
procedures, you should talk to a lawyer. In limited civil 
cases and infraction cases, you must hire a lawyer at 
your own expense if you want one (the court cannot 
provide one). You can get information about finding a 
lawyer on the California Courts Online Self-Help Center 
at www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-lowcosthelp.htm. You 
may also get help from the small claims advisors in your 
county if available. Ask the court how to contact them or 
look for contact information at www.courts.ca.gov 
/selfhelp-advisors.htm.  

INFORMATION FOR THE PETITIONER 

his part of the information sheet is written for the 
petitioner—the party asking for the writ. It explains 
some of the rules and procedures relating to asking for a 
writ. The information may also be helpful to a real party 
in interest. There is more information for a real party in 
interest starting on page 8 of this information sheet. 

 

Who can ask for a writ? 

arties—the plaintiff or defendant— are usually the only 

ones that ask for writs challenging small claims court 
rulings. However, in most cases, a person who was not a 
party does have the legal right to ask for a writ if that 
person has a “beneficial interest” in the small claims 
court’s ruling. A “beneficial interest” means that the 
person has a specific right or interest affected by the 
ruling that goes beyond the general rights or interests the 
public may have in the ruling. 

How do I ask for a writ? 

o ask for a writ you must serve and file a petition for a 
writ (see below for an explanation of how to “serve and 
file” a petition). A petition is a formal request that the

o  Has acted in a way the law says it does not have

  The small claims court has performed or says it is 

going to perform a judicial function (like deciding a 
person’s rights under law in a particular case) in a 
way that the court does not have the legal power to 
do. 

Can the appellate division consider a 
request for a writ in any small claims 
case? 

o. Different courts have the power (called 

“jurisdiction”) to consider requests for writs in different 
types of cases. Requests for writs in small claims cases 
may be considered in one of three different ways, 
depending on the stage of the case: 
  

  Requests for writs relating to actions of the 

small claims division other than postjudgment 
enforcement orders are considered by a single 
judge in the appellate division. This covers 
requests for writs on any rulings relating to the 
initial small claims trial, including the judgment.   
 

  Requests for writs relating to superior court 

actions in small claims cases on appeal are not 
considered by the appellate division, but by the 
Court of Appeal. 
 

  Requests for writs relating to the enforcement of 
a judgment in a small claims case, whether the 
judgment was issued at the small claims hearing 
or at a new trial in the superior court, are 
considered by the appellate division.

person’s rights under law in a particular case) in a 
way that the court does not have the legal power to

need to: 

  Show that the small claims court has the legal duty 
or the power to act or not act in a particular way. 
You will need to tell the appellate division judge 
what legal authority—what constitutional provision, 
statute, rule, or published court decision—
establishes the small claims court’s legal duty or 
power to act or not act in that way. 

  Show the appellate division judge that the small 

claims court has not acted in the way that this legal 
authority says the court is required to act. You will 
need to tell the appellate division judge what 
happened in the small claims court that shows that 
the small claims court did not act in the way it was 
required to. If the petition raises an issue that would 
require the appellate division judge to consider what 
was said in the small claims court, you will need to 
write a complete and accurate summary of what was 
said by you and others, including the court, that is 
relevant to your request for a writ.  

 

  You can provide this information and the summary 

of what was said at item 10 of the petition and, as 
instructed there, you can add additional pages if 
more room is needed. Note that you will be 
providing this information, and everything in the 
petition, under penalty of perjury. 

.  Description of why you need the writ 

ne of the most important parts of your petition is 
explaining to the appellate division why you need the 
writ you have requested. Remember, the appellate 
division judge does not have to grant your petition just 
because the small claims court made an error. You must 
convince the appellate division that it is important for it 
to issue the writ.

explains to the appellate division what happened in the 
small claims court, what legal error you (the petitioner) 
believe the small claims court made, why you have no 
other adequate remedy at law, and what order you are 
requesting the appellate division to make.

How do I prepare a writ petition? 
 

If you are represented by a lawyer, your lawyer will 
prepare your petition for a writ. If you are not 
represented by a lawyer, you must use Petition for Writ 
(Small Claims) (form SC-300) to prepare your petition. 
You can get it at any courthouse or county law library or 
online at www.courts.ca.gov/forms. This form asks you 
to fill in the information that needs to be in a writ 
petition. 

.  Description of your interest in the small 

claims court’s ruling 

our petition needs to tell the appellate division judge 

why you have a right to ask for a writ in the case. As 
discussed above, usually only a person who was a party 
in the small claims court case asks for a writ challenging 
a ruling in that case. If you were a party in the small 
claims court case, say that in your petition. If you were 
not a party, you will need to describe what “beneficial 
interest” you have in the small claims court’s ruling. A 
“beneficial interest” means that you have a specific right 
or interest affected by the ruling that goes beyond the 
general rights or interests the public may have in the 
ruling. To show the appellate division judge that you 
have a beneficial interest in the ruling you want to 
challenge, you must describe how the ruling will affect 
you in a direct and negative way. 

.  Description of the legal error you believe the 

small claims court made 

our petition will need to tell the appellate division 

judge what legal error you believe the small claims court 
made. Not every mistake a small claims court might 
make can be addressed by a writ. You must show that 
the small claims court made one of the following types 
of legal errors: 

  The small claims court has a legal duty to act but: 

o  Refuses to act 
o  Has not done what the law says it must do

sure you also check the “Stay requested” box on the first 
page of the Petition for Writ (Small Claims) (form SC-

.  Verifying the petition 

etitions for writs must be “verified.” This means that 
the petitioner (or in certain circumstances the petitioner’s 
attorney) must declare under penalty of perjury that the 
facts stated in the petition are true and correct, must sign 
the petition, and must indicate the date that the petition 
was signed. On the last page of the Petition for Writ 
(Small Claims) (form SC-300), there is a place for you to 
verify your petition. 

Is there anything else that I need to 
serve and file with my petition? 

es. Along with the petition, you must serve and file 
documents showing what happened in the small claims 
court (see below for an explanation of how to serve and 
file the petition and other documents). Because the 
appellate division judge was not there in the small 
claims court, copies of certain documents from that court 
that show what happened must be sent to the appellate 
division judge. These are called “supporting 
documents.” You must also serve any other party in this 
case, the real party in interest, with a copy of this form

opies of documents from the small claims court. 
Copies of the following documents from the small

Your petition needs to show that a writ is the only way 
to fix the small claims court’s error. To convince the 
court you need the writ, you will need to show the 
appellate division judge that you have no way to fix the 
small claims court’s error other than through a writ (this 
is called having “no adequate remedy at law”). 

his will be hard to show if the small claims court’s 
ruling can be appealed and a new trial held. If you are a 
defendant and the ruling you are challenging can be 
appealed, the appellate division will generally consider 
this new trial to be a good enough way to fix the small 
claims court’s ruling (an “adequate remedy”). You will 
need to show the appellate division judge how you will 
be harmed by the small claims court’s error in a way that 
cannot be fixed by the new trial if the appellate division 
judge does not issue the writ (this is called “irreparable” 
injury or harm). For example, the harm you want to 
prevent may happen before the new trial can be held. 

ven if you cannot appeal the ruling you are objecting 

to, the appellate division judge still does not have to 
grant the petition. As described above, small claims 
decisions are meant to be speedy and inexpensive, so 
appellate review is generally not granted in these cases. 
You will need to explain why your case should be 
treated differently. 

.  Description of the order you want the 

appellate division to make 

our petition needs to describe what you are asking the 
appellate division judge to order the small claims court 
to do or not do. Writ petitions usually ask that the small 
claims court be ordered to cancel (“vacate”) its ruling, 
issue a new ruling, or not take any steps to enforce its 
ruling. 
 
 
If you want the appellate division judge to order the 
small claims court not to do anything more until the 
appellate division judge decides whether to grant the 
writ you are requesting, you must ask for a “stay.” If you 
want a stay, you should first ask the small claims court 
for a stay. You should tell the appellate division judge 
whether you asked the small claims court for a stay. If 
you did not ask the small claims court for a stay, you 
should tell the appellate division judge why you did not 
do this. This information is requested in the petition 
form.

How do I “serve” my petition? 

ule 8.972(d) requires that the petition with the attached 

supporting documents, along with a copy of this form, 
be served on any named real party in interest and that the 
petition be served on the respondent small claims court. 
“Serving” a petition on a party means that you must: 

  Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a party 
to the case—so not you—mail or deliver (“serve”) 
the petition to the real party in interest and the 
respondent court in the way required by law. 

 

  Make a record that the petition has been served. This 
record is called a “proof of service.” Proof of Service 
(Appellate Division) (form APP-109) can be used to 
make this record. The proof of service must show 
who served the petition, who was served with the 
petition, how the petition was served (by mail or in 
person), and the date the petition was served. 

ou can get more information about how to serve court 

documents and proof of service from What Is Proof of 
Service? (form APP-109-INFO) and on the California 
Courts Online Self-Help Center at www.courts.ca.gov 
/selfhelp-serving.htm.

How do I file my petition? 

o file a petition for a writ, you must bring or mail the 

original petition, including the supporting documents 
and the proof of service, to the clerk for the appellate 
division of the superior court that made the ruling you 
are challenging. If the superior court has more than one 
courthouse location, you should call the clerk at the 
courthouse where the ruling you are challenging was 
made to ask where to file your petition. 

ou should make a copy of all the documents you are 

planning to file for your own records before you file 
them with the court. It is a good idea to bring or mail an 
extra copy of the petition to the clerk when you file your 
original and ask the clerk to stamp this copy to show that 
the original has been filed.

ormat of the supporting documents. Supporting 
documents must be put in the format required by rule 
8.972 of the California Rules of Court. You should 
carefully read rule 8.972. You can get a copy of rule 
8.972 at any courthouse or county law library or online 
at www.courts.ca.gov/rules. 
 

 

14 

Is there a deadline to ask for a writ? 

es. There are laws (statutes) that require that certain 

kind of rulings may only be challenged using a writ 
proceeding. These are called “statutory writs” and the 
statute usually sets the deadline for serving and filing the 
petition. For example, a writ challenging a ruling on a 
motion to disqualify a judge (see California Code of 
Civil Procedure section 170.3(d)) must be filed within 
10 days after notice to the parties of the decision. You 
will need to check whether there is a statute providing a 
deadline for filing a challenge to the specific ruling you 
are challenging. (You can find copies of statutes at any 
county law library or online at leginfo.legislature.ca.gov 
/faces/codes.xhtml). 

f there is not a statute specifically providing for a writ 
proceeding to challenge a particular ruling, or if the 
statute does not set a deadline, you should file the 
petition as soon as possible and not later than 30 days 
after the court makes the ruling that you are challenging  
in the petition. While there is no absolute deadline for 
filing these petitions, writ petitions are usually used 
when it is urgent that the small claims court’s error be 
fixed. Remember, the appellate division judge is not 
required to grant your petition even if the small claims 
court made an error. If you delay in filing your petition, 
it may make the appellate division judge think that it is 
not really urgent that the small claims court’s error be 
fixed and the appellate division judge may deny your 
petition. If there are extraordinary circumstances that 
delayed the filing of your petition, you should explain 
these circumstances to the appellate division judge in 
your petition.

extraordinary circumstances the petition may be filed 
without copies of the documents from the small claims 
court. If the petition is filed without these documents, 
you must explain in your petition the urgency and the 
circumstances making the documents unavailable. 

es. You should ask the clerk for the appellate division 
where you are filing the petition what this fee is. If you 
cannot afford to pay this filing fee, you can ask the court 
to waive this fee. To do this, you must fill out a Request

c.  Alternative writ or order to show cause 

n “alternative writ” is an order telling the small claims 
court either to do what the petitioner has requested in the 
petition (or some modified form of what the petitioner 
requested) or to show the appellate division judge why 
the small claims court should not be ordered to do what 
the petitioner requested. An “order to show cause” is 
similar; it is an order telling the small claims court to 
show the appellate division judge why the small claims 
court should not be ordered to do what the petitioner 
requested in the petition (or some modified form of what 
the petitioner requested). The appellate division judge 
will issue an alternative writ or an order to show cause 
only if the petitioner has shown that he or she has no 
adequate remedy at law and the appellate division judge 
has decided that the petitioner may have shown that the 
small claims court made a legal error that needs to be 
fixed. 

f the appellate division judge issues an alternative writ 
and the small claims court does what the petitioner 
requested (or a modified form of what the petitioner 
requested as ordered by the appellate division judge), 
then no further action by the appellate division judge is 
needed and the appellate division may dismiss the 
petition. 

f the small claims court does not comply with an 
alternative writ, however, or if the appellate division 
judge issues an order to show cause, then the respondent 
court or a real party in interest can file a response to the 
appellate division judge’s order (called a “return”) that 
explains why the small claims court should not be 
ordered to do what the petitioner requested. The return 
must be served and filed within the time specified by the 
appellate division judge or, if no time is specified, within 
30 days from the date the alternative writ or order to 
show cause was issued. The petitioner will then have an 
opportunity to serve and file a reply within 15 days after 
the return is filed. The appellate division judge may set 
the matter for oral argument. When all the papers have 
been served and filed (or the time to serve and file them 
has passed) and any oral argument is completed, the 
appellate division will decide the case. 

.  Peremptory writ in the first instance 

 “peremptory writ in the first instance” is an order 
telling the small claims court to do what the petitioner

to Waive Court Fees (form FW-001). You can get form 
FW-001 at any courthouse or county law library or 
online at www.courts.ca.gov/forms. You can file this 
application either before you file your petition or with 
your petition. The court will review this application and 
decide whether to waive the filing fee. 
 

 

What happens after I file my petition?

ithin 10 days after you serve and file your petition, the 
respondent or any real party in interest can serve and file 
a preliminary opposition to the petition.  

he appellate division judge does not have to wait for an 

opposition before acting on a petition for a writ, 
however. Without waiting, the appellate division judge 
can:

Issue a stay. 

.  Summarily deny the petition. 

. 

Issue an alternative writ or order to show cause. 

.  Notify the parties that he or she is considering 
issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance. 

Issue a peremptory writ in the first instance if such 
relief was expressly requested in the petition. 

ead below for more information about these options. 

.  Stay of small claims court proceedings 

 stay is an order from the appellate division judge 
telling the small claims court not to do anything more 
until the appellate division judge decides whether to 
grant your petition. A stay puts the small claims court 
proceedings on temporary hold. 

.  Summary denial 

 “summary denial” means that the appellate division 
judge denies the petition without deciding whether the 
small claims court made the legal error claimed by the 
petitioner or whether the writ requested by the petitioner 
should be issued based on that error. No reasons need to 
be given for a summary denial. Most petitions for writs 
are denied in this way.

but you are not required to do this. The appellate 
division judge can take certain actions without waiting 
for any opposition, including: 

  Summarily denying the petition 

Issuing an alternative writ or order to show cause 

  Notifying the parties that the judge is considering 
issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance 

 

Issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance if such

ead the response in section        for more information

about these options. 

ost petitions for writs are summarily denied, often 
within a few days after they are filed. If you have not 
already received something from the appellate division 
judge saying what action the judge is taking on the 
petition, it is a good idea to call the appellate division to 
see if the petition has been denied before you decide 
whether and how to respond. 

his would also be a good time to talk to a lawyer. You 

do not have to have a lawyer; you are allowed to 
represent yourself in a writ proceeding in the appellate 
division. But writ proceedings can be very complicated 
and you will have to follow the same rules that lawyers 
have to follow. If you have any questions about writ 
proceedings or about whether and how you should 
respond to a writ petition, you should talk to a lawyer. 
You must hire a lawyer at your own expense if you want 
one (the court cannot provide one). You can get 
information about finding a lawyer on the California 
Courts Online Self-Help Center at www.courts.ca.gov 
/selfhelp-lowcosthelp.htm. You may also get help from 
the small claims advisors in your county if available. 
Ask the court how to contact them or look for contact 
information at www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-advisors.htm.   

f the petition has not already been summarily denied, 
you may, but are not required to, serve and file a 
preliminary opposition to the petition within 10 days 
after the petition was served and filed. The appellate 
division judge will seldom grant a writ without first 
issuing an alternative writ, an order to show cause, or a 
notice that the judge is considering issuing a peremptory 
writ. In all these circumstances, you will get notice from 
the court and have a chance to file a response. Note that

has requested (or some modified form of what the 
petitioner requested) that is issued without the appellate 
division judge first issuing an alternative writ or order to 
show cause. It is very rare for the appellate division 
judge to issue a peremptory writ in the first instance, and 
this will not be done unless the respondent and real 
parties in interest have received notice that the judge 
might do so, either through the petitioner expressly 
asking for such relief in the petition or by the judge 
giving the respondent court and any real party in interest 
notice and a chance to file an opposition.   

he respondent court or a real party in interest can file a 
response to the appellate division judge’s notice (called 
an “opposition”) that explains why the small claims 
court should not be ordered to do what the petitioner has 
requested. The opposition must be served and filed 
within the time specified by the appellate division judge 
or, if no time is specified, within 30 days from the date 
the notice was issued. The petitioner will then have a 
chance to serve and file a reply within 15 days after the 
opposition is filed. The appellate division judge may 
then set the matter for oral argument. When all the 
papers have been served and filed (or the time to serve 
and file them has passed) and any oral argument is 
completed, the appellate division judge will decide the 
case. 

INFORMATION FOR A REAL PARTY 
IN INTEREST 

his part of the information sheet is written for a real 
party in interest—a party from the small claims court 
case other than the petitioner who will be affected by a 
ruling on a petition for a writ. It explains some of the 
rules and procedures relating to responding to a petition 
for a writ. The information may also be helpful to the 
petitioner.

es. Unless the small claims court has already done 
what the alternative writ told it to do, you should serve 
and file a response called a “return.” 

s explained above, the appellate division judge will 
issue an alternative writ or an order to show cause only 
if the appellate division judge has decided that the 
petitioner may have shown that the small claims court 
made a legal error that needs to be fixed. An “alternative

the appellate division judge may issue a peremptory writ 
without notice if the petitioner expressly asked the court 
to do so in the petition, that is, asked the court to issue a 
peremptory writ in the first instance. If the petitioner did 
that, you may want to consider whether to file a 
preliminary opposition, to explain why you believe the 
small claims court made no legal error and why the 
petitioner is not entitled to a writ.  

f you decide to file a preliminary opposition, you must 
serve that preliminary opposition on all the other parties 
to the writ proceeding. “Serving and filing” an 
opposition means that you must: 

  Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a party 
to the case—so not you—mail or deliver (“serve”) 
the preliminary opposition to the other parties in the 
way required by law. 

  Make a record that the preliminary opposition has 
been served. This record is called a “proof of 
service.” Proof of Service (Appellate Division) (form 
APP-109) can be used to make this record. The 
proof of service must show who served the 
preliminary opposition, who was served with the 
preliminary opposition, how the preliminary 
opposition was served (by mail or in person), and 
the date the preliminary opposition was served. 

  File the original preliminary opposition and the 
proof of service with the appellate division. You 
should make a copy of the preliminary opposition 
you are planning to file for your own records before 
you file it with the court. It is a good idea to bring or 
mail an extra copy of the preliminary opposition to 
the clerk when you file your original and ask the

“peremptory writ in the first instance” is an order telling 
the small claims court to do what the petitioner has 
requested (or some modified form of what the petitioner 
requested as ordered by the appellate division judge) that 
is issued without the appellate division judge first 
issuing an alternative writ or order to show cause. The 
appellate division judge will seldom issue a peremptory 
writ in the first instance without first giving the parties 
notice and a chance to file an opposition. However, 
when the appellate division judge issues such a notice, it 
means that the appellate division judge is strongly 
considering granting the writ requested by the petitioner. 

n opposition is your argument to the appellate division 

judge about why the small claims court should not be 
ordered to do what the petitioner has requested. If you 
are represented by a lawyer in the writ proceeding, your 
lawyer will prepare your opposition. If you are not 
represented by a lawyer, you will need to prepare your 
own opposition. An opposition is a response to the legal 
arguments made by the petitioner. Unless the appellate 
division judge sets a different deadline in the notice that 
the judge is considering issuing a peremptory writ, you 
must serve and file your opposition within 30 days after 
the appellate division issues the notice. The opposition 
must be served on all the other parties to the writ 
proceeding. “Serving and filing” the opposition means 
that you must: 

  Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a party 
to the case—so not you—mail or deliver (“serve”) 
the opposition to the other parties in the way 
required by law.

to explain any legal defenses to the legal arguments 
made by the petitioner. You should read California Code 
of Civil Procedure sections 430.10–431.30 for more 
information about responses and answers. You can get 
copies of these statutes at any county law library or 
online at leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml. A 
return can also include additional supporting documents 
not already filed by the petitioner. 

f you do not file a return when the appellate division 
judge issues an alternative writ or order to show cause, it 
does not mean that the appellate division judge is 
required to issue the writ requested by the petitioner. 
However, the appellate division judge will treat the facts 
stated by the petitioner in the petition as true, which 
makes it more likely the appellate division judge will 
issue the requested writ. 

nless the appellate division judge sets a different filing 

deadline in the alternative writ or order to show cause, 
you must serve and file your return within 30 days after 
the appellate division judge issues the alternative writ or 
order to show cause. The return must be served on all the 
other parties to the writ proceeding. “Serving and filing” 
the return means that you must: 

  Have somebody over 18 years old who is not a party 
to the case—so not you—mail or deliver (“serve”) 
the return to the other parties in the way required by 
law. 
 

  Make a record that the return has been served. This 

record is called a “proof of service.” Proof of Service

who served the return, who was served with the 
return, how the return was served (by mail or in

  File the original return and the proof of service with 
the appellate division. You should make a copy of 
the return you are planning to file for your own 
records before you file it with the court. It is a good 
idea to bring or mail an extra copy of the return to

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
