 § 527. 85
 How Do I Get an Orde
 r to Prohibit Private Postsecondary School Violence? (Private Postsecondary School Violence Prevention) 
 SV 100 INFO, 
 Page 1 of 4 The chief administrative officer of a private 
 postsecondary educational in
 stitution, or an officer 
 or employee designated by 
 the chief administrative officer to maintain order on the school campus or 
 facility, may request court orders prohibiting 
 credible threats of violen
 ce against a student. These 
 orders must be requested
 by an officer of the 
 institution that the student attends or is applying to. 
 These orders will be enforced by law enforcement 
 
 agencies. A ﬁstudentﬂ is an adult curren
 tly enrolled in or applying for admission to a privat
 e postsecondary educational institution. 
 ŁWhat is a private postsecondary school violence protection order? Under California law (Code Civ. Proc. , § 527. 85) , 
 courts can make orders to protect a student from 
 being subjected to credible
 threats of violence that 
 could be carried out on the 
 school campus or facility. 
 The procedure is only available with regard to 
 
 students at private po
 stsecondary institutions. 
 A ﬁchief administrative offi
 cerﬂ is the principal, 
 president, or highest ranking official of the private 
 postsecondary educational institution. 
 ŁA ﬁpostsecondary educational institutionﬂ is a 
 private institution of vocational, professional, or 
 
 postsecondary education. 
 ŁUnder this statute, the schoo
 l officer can obtain a court 
 order on behalf of a student that lasts up to three years. 
 
 The order can also protect fa
 mily or household members 
 of the student and other students at the campus or facility 
 who are similarly situated. 
 The student has suffered a cr
 edible threat of violence 
 
 from any individual; 
 2. 3. The respondent™s conduct is not allowable as part of a 
 legitimate labor dispute as permitted by Code of Civil 
 
 Procedure section 527. 3; and
 The respondent is not engaged in constitutionally 
 protected activity. 
 The credible threat of violence, while made off of the 
 campus or facility, can reasonably be construed to be 
 
 carried out or have been carried out at the school campus 
 or facility; 
 1. 4. The ﬁrespondentﬂ is the pers
 on against whom the school official is requesting the protective order. 
 ŁWhat forms must be used to get the order? The following forms are needed to start the process: 
 Petition for Private Postseco
 ndary School Violence 
 Restraining Orders 
 (Petition) (Form SV 100) . This 
 form tells the judge the facts of the case and what orders 
 the petitioner and student want the court to make. 
 2. 1. 3. Notice of Court Hearing 
 (Form SV 109) . This form tells 
 the parties when the hearing on the petition will be held. 
 Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) (Form SV 110) . A TRO can be issued to provid
 e protection to the student 
 until the hearing is held. It can be issued by the judge 
 either with or without notice to the respondent. 
 4. A school official may seek protection under this law if: 
 Confidential C
 LETS Information (Form CLETS 001) . 
 This form will provide law 
 enforcement agencies with 
 the information needed to en
 force any orders that are granted. 
 The statute differs from ot
 her California laws that 
 allow victims of unlawful vi
 olence or credible threats 
 of violence to ask the court for these orders 
 themselves. 
 If anyone other than a school officer 
 wishes to apply to the court for an order prohibiting 
 
 harassment, see 
 Can a Civil Harassment Restraining 
 Order Help Me 
 (Form CH 100 INFO) 
 ? . These instructions cannot cover all of the questions that may arise in a particular case. If you 
 do not know what to do to protect your rights, you should see a lawyer.

 SV 100 INFO, 
 Page 2 of 4
 The school official may be represented by a lawyer, 
 but one is not required by law. Because the school 
 official™s lawyer will generally be representing the 
 
 interests of the student, the student usually does not need his or her own lawyer. Whether or not the school 
 
 official has a lawyer, the 
 respondent may have one. 
 Do I need a lawyer? What steps are needed to get the court orders? 1. 2. 4. If you are applying for a 
 TRO, fill out Form SV 110 
 completely. The Petition and 
 declarations must give 
 the details of the credible 
 threats of violence and the problems they have caused your student. 
 To obtain a TRO, you must notify the respondent of the 
 request for the temporary order unless both of the 
 following requirements are satisfied: 
 a. It appears from facts shown on the petition that great 
 or irreparable injury will result before the matter can 
 be heard on notice; and
 You or your attorney certif
 ies one of the following to the court under oath: 
 (1) That within a reasonable time before presenting 
 the petition to the court to ask for a TRO, you 
 informed the respondent or the respondent™s 
 attorney when and where the request for a TRO 
 would be made; 
 (2) 
 That you in good faith attempted but were unable 
 to inform the respondent and the respondent™s 
 
 attorney, specifying the efforts made to contact 
 them; or
 (3) That for reasons specified, you should not be 
 required to inform the respondent or the 
 
 respondent™s attorney. b. 
 5. Private Postsecondary Scho
 ol Violence Restraining 
 Order After Hearing
 (Order) (Form SV 130) . This 
 form is signed by the co
 urt following the hearing. 
 The order can last for up to three years depending 
 
 on what the judge rules. 
 6. Proof of Personal Service 
 (Form SV 200) . This 
 
 form is used to show that the other party has been 
 served with the petition and other forms as 
 required by law. 
 These forms are all mandatoryŠ
 that is, they must be 
 used in the school violen
 ce prevention proceeding. 
 Where can I get these forms? Fill in the 
 Petition (Form SV 100) completely and 
 fill in items 1Œ3 of the 
 Notice of Court Hearing (Form SV 109) . If you are seeking a TRO, also fill out Form SV 110. 
 If you are seeking orders
 based on information from 
 your student and others and not based on what you 
 have personally observed, you 
 must have each of those persons complete a decl
 aration to attach to the 
 Petition 
 (Form SV 100) . You may use Form 
 MC 031, 
 Attached Declaration

 (Private Postsecondary School Violence Prevention) 
 5. 
 Take your original comp
 leted forms and copies to 
 the clerk™s office at the court. You will need at least 
 three copies: one for you, one for the student, and 
 one to serve on the respondent. If there are other 
 
 persons to be protected by the order, you will need 
 additional copies of the 
 TRO. A protected person 
 will need a copy of the 
 TRO if it is necessary to call 
 the police. The clerk will file
 the originals, assign a 
 case number, and return the 
 copies ﬁfile stampedﬂ to 
 you. The clerk will write your hearing date on the 
 Notice of Court Hearing
 (Form SV 109) . 
 6. 
 SV 100 INFOHow Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Private Postsecondary School Violence? Fill in 
 Confidential CLETS 
 Information, (Form CLETS 001) , with as much
 information as you 
 know. If the judge grants the order, the 
 
 information on this form will be entered into a 
 statewide protective order database that will be 
 available to law enforcement agencies if the order 
 
 needs to be enforced. You can get the forms from legal publishers or on the 
 Internet at www. courts. ca. gov. You also may be able 
 to find them at your loca
 l courthouse or county law 
 library. 
 If you are seeking a 
 TRO (Form SV 110) , the clerk 
 will tell you where and how to present your 
 
 proposed order to a judge for consideration and 
 signature. The court will decide within 24 hours 
 
 whether or not to make the order. Sometimes the 
 court decides right away. Ask the clerk if you should 
 wait or come back later. If your request for a 
 TRO is granted while you are still at the court, take the 
 signed original back to the clerk to be filed. 
 If the student does not speak English, when you 
 file your papers, ask the clerk if a court interpreter 
 will be available for the hearing. You may have to 
 
 pay a fee for the interpreter. If an interpreter will 
 not be provided, you should ask someone who is 
 
 not listed as a person to be protected on your 
 
 Petition and who is over age 18 to interpret
 . 8. 9. Have the respondent personally 
 served with 
 copies of the 
 Petition (Form SV 100) , the Notice of Court Hearing 
 (Form SV 109) , the TRO (Form SV 110) (if issued) , a blank 
 Response (Form SV 120) , and a blank 
 Proof of Service of 
 Response by Mail (Form SV 250) . You 
 cannot serve the respondent yourself. Service may be 
 made by a licensed process server, the sheriff™s 
 department, or any person 18 years of age or 
 older, other than you, the student, or anyone to be 
 
 protected by the order. For help with service, ask 
 the court clerk for Form SV 200 INFO, 
 What Is 
 ﬁProof of Personal Serviceﬂ? . 
 Service is essential. It tells the respondent 
 about the order and the hearing. Without it, 
 there cannot be a court hearing, and your 
 temporary orders will no longer be good unless 
 
 they are extended by th
 e court. The respondent 
 should be personally served immediately after 
 
 the orders are signed by
 the judge, unless the court specifies a different time for service. 
 10. 
 After the respondent has been personally 
 served, 
 the 
 person who served the respon
 dent must complete and 
 sign the original 
 Proof of P
 ersonal Service (Form SV 200) . Take the signed original and copies back to 
 
 the court clerk. The clerk will file the original and 
 return ﬁfile stampedﬂ copies to you. Ask the clerk 
 whether you should take a 
 file stamped copy to each law enforcement agency that
 might be called on to 
 enforce the order. If so, do so immediately. 
 7. If a TRO has been issued, ask
 the clerk whether 
 you or your lawyer will need to deliver a 
 
 file stamped copy of the 
 TRO to each law 
 enforcement agency (police, 
 marshal, or sheriff™s 
 office) that might be called 
 on to enforce the order. If so, do so immediately. If the court issues a TRO, it will last 
 until the hearing date.

 ŁŁThe court may or may not let witnesses speak at the 
 hearing. So, if possible, 
 you should bring their 
 written statements under oath to the hearing. (You can use Form MC 030, 
 Declaration. ) The respondent has the righ
 t to attend the hearing, 
 but he or she does not have 
 the right to speak to the 
 student or to any other person seeking protection. If 
 anyone is afraid, tell the court officer.

 with a crime. 15. 
 14. 
 SV 100 INFOYou can bring to the hearing: 
 Go to court on the date shown at item 4 on the 
 Notice of Court Hearing
 (Form SV 109) . You do 
 not need to bring any witn
 esses, but it helps to have 
 more proof of the violence 
 or threats than just one 
 person™s word. 
 Written statements from witnesses made under oath 
 How Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Private Postsecondary School Violence? If the respondent attended the hearing and heard the 
 terms of the 
 Order from the court, no additional 
 proof of service is necessary. If the respondent did 
 not attend the hearing, but the 
 Order
 issued is the 
 same as the TRO (except for 
 the termination date) , 
 the 
 Order may be served on the respondent by 
 mail. File Form SV 260, 
 Proof of Service of Order After Hearing by Mail

 attend the hearing and the 
 Order differs from the 
 TRO, arrange to have him or her personally 
 served with a copy of the 
 Order. File the completed 
 Proof 
 of Personal Service
 (Form SV 200) with the court.
