      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov New January 1, 2020, Optional Form Information on How to File a Proof of Service in Criminal Record Clearing Requests CR 106 INFO, Page 1 of 2 CR 106 INFOInformation on How to File a Proof of Service in Criminal Record Clearing Requests 1 What does this information sheet cover? This information sheet tells you how to use and fill out 
 Proof of Service Criminal Record Clearing form CR 106. This information sheet does not need to be copied, 
 served (delivered) , or filed. 2 Once the proof of service is filled out and filed 
 with the court, it shows the court that the other 
 party got the documents. What is proof of service? 34 l What is record clearing? You can start the process of record clearing by 
 filing certain documents or forms called 
 ﬁapplications, ﬂ ﬁpetitions, ﬂ or ﬁmotions. ﬂ Who do I need to serve when I ask a 
 court to clear my criminal record? Most record clearing laws say you have to let the 
 prosecuting agency (usually the district attorney) know 
 about the record clearing request. Sometimes you also have 
 to let law enforcement (like the police or sheriff) or other 
 parties know about your request. You can do so by 
 ﬁservingﬂ (delivering) a copy of the papers you filed with 
 the court on the prosecuting agency or other parties. Read 
 the record clearing law you are basing your request on 
 carefully to see who needs to know about your record 
 clearing request. Those are the parties who must be served. When can I use Proof of Service Criminal Record Clearing (form CR 106) ? 6 Proof of Service Criminal Record Clearing (form CR 106) is intended to be widely used with any record clearing request that requires notification or service of the 
 request to the prosecuting agency and other parties, such as 
 the following optional Judicial Council forms for record 
 clearing: Petition for Dismissal (form CR 180) , dismissals under Penal Code sections 1203. 4, 
 1203. 4 a, 1203. 41, 1203. 42, 1203. 43, and 
 1203. 49, and reductions under Penal Code 
 sections 17 (b) and 17 (d) (2) Petition for Dismissal (Military Personnel) (form CR 183) , dismissals under Penal Code section 1170. 9 (h) , and reductions under Penal 
 Code section 17 (b) l Motion to Vacate Conviction or Sentence 
 (form CR 187) , vacating convictions under Penal Code sections 1016. 5 and 1473. 7 ll Petition/Application for Resentencing and Dismissal (form CR 404) , resentencing and dismissal under Penal Code section 1170. 22 Petition to Seal Arrest and Related Records (form CR 409) , sealing under Penal Code section 851. 91 l Petition for Resentencing Based on Health 
 Conditions From Military Service Listed in 
 Penal Code Section 1170. 91 (b) (form CR 412/MIL 412) l A ﬁproof of serviceﬂ is a form used in legal cases. Record clearing is a process that allows you to ask 
 a court to improve your criminal record. If you want a judge to look at your case, you or 
 someone who is helping you has to file certain 
 documents in court. You also have to give or mail copies of those 
 documents to the other party in the case, usually 
 the prosecutor. The proof of service has spaces for you or 
 someone who is helping you to write in when, 
 where, and how the other party got the documents. Filing a proof of service shows the court that you have let 
 the other parties know about the record clearing request by 
 giving them a copy of the document or form you are using 
 to make a record clearing request to the court. lllll For example, a court may be able to change some convictions from felonies to misdemeanors. lll Why do I need to file a proof of service? 5 Petition/Application (Health and Safety Code, 
 § 11361. 8) (form CR 400) , relief under Proposition 64 for specified marijuana related 
 convictionsl Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (form HC 001) lŠŠŠ 7 Who can serve the petition or motion? In most cases, the law allows you (the person who is filing the record clearing request) to serve 
 the document or form. CR 106 INFOInformation on How to File a Proof of Service in Criminal 
 Record Clearing Requests 8 When are the other parties served, and 
 when do I file a proof of service? Ask the court clerk if any local filing rules 
 apply. CR 106 INFO, Page 2 of 2 Information on How to File a Proof of Service in Criminal Record Clearing Requests New January 1, 202010 What do I do with Proof of Service Criminal Record Clearing (form CR 106) 
 once it is filled out? You should file a completed proof of service with the court 
 where you filed your document or form. Ask the court 
 clerk if any local filing rules apply. In most cases, the other parties should be served after the original document or form is filed with the court. That way, the court may add helpful 
 information to the document or form, such as a 
 hearing date. Some courts require that the document or form is 
 first served on the other parties, and then the 
 original document or form is filed with the court, 
 along with a completed and signed proof of service. When you file the document or form with the court, take the original plus at least two copies of your 
 documents. How should the petition or motion be served? If serving by mail: 9 The court will keep the original. The clerk will stamp your copies ﬁFiledﬂ and return them to you. Keep one copy for your 
 records. The other parties can be served with a copy of your court stamped document or form, and then 
 you should file the proof of service with the 
 court after the parties are served. llll The server should put one copy of the document 
 or form in an envelope addressed to the agency, 
 seal the envelope, and place first class postage on 
 the envelope; and The server should mail the document or form by depositing the envelope at a post office or mailbox or by depositing the envelope at an office or business mail drop where the server knows mail is picked up every day by the postal service. If serving by personal delivery: The server should give the document or form to a 
 person with the agency and note the name of the 
 person, as well as the address, date, and time of 
 the service. You can also ask someone else to serve the 
 document or form. The person who serves a document or form for 
 record clearing and fills out the Proof of Service Criminal Record Clearing (form CR 106) must be at least 18 years old. Read the record clearing law you are basing your request on carefully to see if it sets any 
 other requirements for who can serve the 
 request. llll There are three main ways to serve documents: by mail, personal delivery, or electronic service. Proof of Service Criminal Record Clearing (form CR 106) can be used to prove service by mail or personal delivery. If someone else is serving documents on your behalf, make 
 sure to provide them with the name of the agency that 
 must be served (for example, San Francisco County 
 District Attorney) , the agency s address, and a copy of the 
 document or form. Once the document or form has been served on the other 
 parties by mail or personal delivery, the server should fill 
 out and sign the proof of service form. If serving electronically: Carefully read and follow the requirements in 
 California Rules of Court, rule 2. 251, and use Proof of Electronic Service (form POS 050/EFS 050) . Do not use Proof of Service Criminal Record 
 Clearing (form CR 106) . lllllŠ™ŠŠŠ</div>
