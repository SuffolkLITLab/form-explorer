-NOTICE-

-NOTICIA-

IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE TO EMPLOYEE 
ABOUT EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS 
(Wage Garnishment)

The Earnings Withholding Order requires your 
employer to pay part of your earnings to the sheriff or 
other levying officer. The levying officer will pay the 
money to a creditor who has a court judgment against 
you. The information below may help you protect the 
money you earn.

NOTICIA LEGAL IMPORTANTE RESPECTO 
A LAS ÓRDENES DE RETENCIÓN DE SUELDO

La Orden de Retención de Sueldo requiere que su 
empleador pague una parte de su sueldo a un oficial 
de embargo. El oficial le pagará el dinero retenido a 
su acreedor que ha conseguido una decisión judicial 
en contra de usted. Pida usted que un amigo o su 
abogado le lea este papel oficial. Esta información le 
puede ayudar a proteger su sueldo.

CAN YOU BE FIRED BECAUSE OF THIS?

NO. You cannot be fired unless your earnings have been withheld before for a different court judgment. If this is the first 
judgment for which your wages will be withheld and your employer fires you because of this, the California Labor 
Commissioner, listed in the phone book of larger cities, can help you get your job back.

HOW MUCH OF YOUR PAY WILL BE WITHHELD?

The reverse of the Earnings Withholding Order (abbreviated in this notice as EWO) that applies to you contains Employer 
Instructions. These explain how much of your earnings can be withheld. Generally, the amount is about 25% of your take 
home pay until the amount due has been withheld. The levying officer will notify the employee of an additional 
assessment charged for paying out money collected under this order and that amount will also be withheld.

If you have trouble figuring this out, ask your employer for help.

YES. There are several possibilities.

IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?

1.   See an attorney. If you do not know an attorney, check with the lawyer referral service or the legal aid office in your 
      county (both are listed in the yellow pages under ''Attorneys'').

An attorney may be able to help you make an agreement with your creditor, or may be able to help you stop your 
earnings from being withheld. You may wish to consider bankruptcy or asking the bankruptcy court to help you pay 
your creditors. These possibilities may stop your wages from being withheld.
An attorney can help you decide what is best for you. Take your EWO to the attorney to help you get the best advice 
and the fastest help.

2.   Try to work out an agreement yourself with your creditor. Call the creditor or the creditor's attorney, listed on the

EWO. If you make an agreement, the withholding of your wages will stop or be changed to a smaller amount you
agree on. (See item 4 on the reverse for another way to make an offer to your creditor.)

3.   You can ask for an EXEMPTION. An exemption will protect more, or maybe even all of your earnings. You can get an 
      exemption if you need your earnings to support yourself or your family, but you cannot get an exemption if:

a. You use some of your earnings for luxuries and they aren't really necessary for support; OR 
b. You owe money                                                                                                   OR
to an attorney because of a court order in a family law case;
c. You owe the debt for past due child support of spousal support (alimony);  OR
d. You owe the debt to a former employee for wages.        

HOW DO YOU ASK FOR AN EXEMPTION? 
(See the other side of this form for instructions about claiming an exemption.)

(Wage Garnishment)

Code of Civil Procedure, § 706.122
www.courts.ca.gov

HOW DO YOU ASK FOR AN EXEMPTION?

WG-003

1.   Call or write the levying officer for three (3) copies each of  the
      forms called ''Claim of Exemption'' and ''Financial  Statement.'' 
      These forms are free. The name and address of the levying officer
      are in the big box on the right at the top of the EWO.

2.   Fill out both forms. On the forms are some sentences or words

which have boxes
words  which  follow  may  not  apply  to  your  case.  If  the  words  do 
apply, put a check in the box.

in front of them. The box means the

Remember,  it  is  your  job  to  prove  with  the  Financial  Statement 
form  that  your  earnings  are  needed  for  support.  Write  down  the 
details about your needs.

3.   For example, if your child has special medical expenses, tell which

child,  what  illnesses,  who  the  doctor  is,  how  often  the  doctor  must 
be  visited,  the  cost  per  visit,  and  the  costs  of  medicines.  These 
details should be listed in item 6. If you need more space, put ''See 
attachment 6'' and attach a typed 8½ by 11 sheet of paper on which 
you have explained your expenses in detail.

4.  You can use the Claim of Exemption form to make an offer to the

judgment creditor to have a specified amount withheld each pay 
period. Complete item 3 on the form to indicate the amount you 
agree to have withheld each pay day during the withholding 
period. (Be sure it's less than the amount to be withheld otherwise.) 
If your creditor accepts your offer, he will not oppose your claim of 
exemption. (See (1) below. )

5.  Sign the Claim of Exemption and Financial Statement forms. Be

sure  the  Claim  of  Exemption  form  shows  the  address  where  you 
receive mail.

6.   Mail or deliver two (2) copies of each of the two forms to the levying
officer.  Keep  one  copy  for  yourself  in  case  a  court  hearing  is 
necessary.

Do not use the Claim of Exemption and Financial Statement forms to 
seek  a  modification  of  child  support  or  alimony  payments.  These 
payments  can  be  modified  only  by  the  family  law  court  that  ordered 
them.

FILE YOUR CLAIM OF EXEMPTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR 
THE MOST PROTECTION.

ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN NEXT

(1) The judgment creditor will not oppose (object to) your claim of

exemption. If this happens, after 10 days the levying officer will tell 
your  employer  to  stop  withholding  or  withhold  less  from  your 
earnings. The part (or all) of your earnings needed for support will 
be paid to you or paid as you direct. And you will get back earnings 
the levying officer or your employer were holding when you asked 
for the exemption.

—OR—

(2) The creditor will oppose (object to) your claim of exemption. If this

happens,  you  will  receive  a  Notice  of  Opposition  and  Notice  of 
Hearing  on  Claim  of  Exemption,  in  which  the  creditor  states  why 
your  exemption  should  not  be  allowed.  A  box  in  the  middle  of  the 
Notice of Hearing tells you the time and place of the court hearing 
which will be in about ten days. Be sure to go to the hearing if you 
can.

If the judgment creditor has checked the box in item 3 on the Notice of 
Hearing on Claim of Exemption, the creditor will not be in court. If you 
are willing to have the court make its decision based on your Financial 
Statement and the creditor's Notice of Opposition, you need not go to 
the hearing.

The  Notice  of  Opposition  to  Claim  of  Exemption  will  tell  you  why  the 
creditor  thinks  your  claim  should  not  be  allowed.  If  you  go  to  the 
hearing,  take  any  bills,  paycheck  stubs,  cancelled  checks,  or  other 
evidence (including witnesses) that will help

you prove your Claim of Exemption and Financial Statement are correct 
and your earnings are needed to support yourself or your family.

Perhaps you can even prove the Notice of Opposition is wrong. For 
example, perhaps the Notice of Opposition states that the judgment 
was for wages for a past employee.You may be able to provide 
evidence that the person was not an employee or that the debt was 
not for wages.

If  the  judge  at  the  hearing  agrees  with  you,  your  employer  will  be 
ordered to stop withholding your earnings or withhold less money. The 
judge  can  even  order  that  the  EWO  end  before  the  hearing  (so  you 
would get some earnings back).

If the judge does not agree with you, the withholding will continue 
unless you appeal to a higher court. The rules for appeals are 
complex so you should see an attorney if you want to appeal.

If you have one court hearing, you should not file another Claim of 
Exemption about the same EWO unless your finances have gotten 
worse in an important way.

If your EWO is to be changed or ended, the levying officer must sign 
the  notice  to  your  employer  of  the  change.  He  may  give  you 
permission to deliver it to the employer, or it can be mailed.

WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR EARNINGS IF YOU FILE A CLAIM OF EXEMPTION?

Your employer must continue to hold back part of your earnings for the 
EWO until he receives a notice signed by the levying officer to change 
the order or end it early.

The levying officer will keep your withheld earnings until your Claim of 
Exemption is denied or takes effect. At that time your earnings will be 
paid according to the law that applies to your case.

REGARDING CHILD SUPPORT

If  you  are  obligated  to  make  child  support  payments,  the  local  child 
support  agency  may  help  you  to  have  an  Order  Assigning  Salary  or 
Wages entered. This order has the top priority claim on your earnings. 
When it is in effect, little or no money may be

available  to  be  withheld  for  an  EWO.  And,  if  the  local  child  support 
agency is involved in collecting this support from you, it may agree to 
accept less money if this special order is entered.

WHAT IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS?

If you cannot see an attorney, or don't want to see an attorney, you 
might be able to answer some of your questions by reading the law in a 
law library. Ask the law librarian to help you find sections 706.050 and 
706.105 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Other sections of the 
code, beginning with section 706.010 may also answer some of your 
questions.

Also, the office of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department 
of Labor may be able to answer some of your questions. Offices are 
listed in the telephone directory under the U.S. Department of Labor in 
the U.S. Government listing.
