 NOTICIA LEGAL IMPORTANTE RESPECTO 
 A LAS ÓRDENES DE RETENCIÓN DE SUELDO
 IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE TO EMPLOYEE 
 ABOUT EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS 
 
 (Wage Garnishment) 
 La Orden de Retención de Sueldo
 requiere que su 
 empleador pague una parte de su sueldo a un oficial 
 de embargo. El oficial le 
 pagará el dinero retenido a 
 su acreedor que ha conseguido una decisión judicial 
 
 en contra de usted. Pida 
 usted que un amigo o su 
 abogado le lea este papel oficial. Esta información le 
 
 puede ayudar a proteger su sueldo. 
 CAN YOU BE FIRED BECAUSE OF THIS? 
 NO. You cannot be fired unless your earnings have been withheld 
 before for a different court j
 udgment. If this is the first 
 judgment for which your wages will be withheld and your em
 ployer fires you because of this, the California Labor 
 Commissioner, listed in the phone book of larger
 cities, can help you get your job back. 
 HOW MUCH OF YOUR PAY WILL BE WITHHELD? 
 The reverse of the Earnings Withholding Or
 der (abbreviated in this notice as EWO) 
 that applies to you contains Employer 
 Instructions. These explain how much of your earnings can 
 be withheld. Generally, the amount 
 is about 25% of your take 
 home pay until the amount due has been withheld. The levyi
 ng officer will notify the employee of an additional 
 assessment charged for paying out money collected under th
 is order and that amount will also be withheld. 
 If you have trouble figuring this out, ask your employer for help. 
 IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO? 
 YES. There are several possibilities. 
 1. See an attorney. If you do not know 
 an attorney, check with the lawyer referral 
 service or the legal aid office in your 
 county (both are listed in
 the yellow pages under ''Attorneys'') . 
 An attorney may be able to help you make an agreement wit
 h your creditor, or may be 
 able to help you stop your 
 earnings from being withheld. You may wish to consider 
 bankruptcy or asking the bankruptcy court to help you pay 
 your creditors. These possibilities may stop your wages from being withheld. 
 An attorney can help you decide what is best for you. Take your 
 EWO to the attorney to help you get the best advice 
 and the fastest help. 
 2. Try to work out an agreement your
 self with your creditor. Call the creditor 
 or the creditor's attorney, listed on the
 EWO
 . If you make an agreement, the withholding of your 
 wages will stop or be changed to a smaller amount you
 agree on. (See item 4 on the reverse for another way to make an offer to your creditor. ) 
 3. You can ask for an EXEMPTION. An 
 exemption will protect more, or
 maybe even all of your 
 earnings. You can get an 
 exemption if you need your earni
 ngs to support yourse
 lf or your family, 
 but you cannot get an exemption if: 
 a. You use some of your earnings for luxuries
 and they aren't really
 necessary for support; 
 OR b. You owe money 
 ORc. You owe the debt for past due child 
 support of spousal support (alimony) ; 
 ORd. You owe the debt to a former employee for wages. 
 
 HOW DO YOU ASK FOR AN EXEMPTION? 
 (See the other side of this form for in
 structions about claiming an exemption. ) 
 EMPLOYEE INSTRUCTIONS (Wage Garnishment) 
 Form Adopted for Mandatory Use 
 Judicial Council of California 
 
 WG 003 [Rev. January 2, 2012] 
 Code of Civil Procedure, § 706. 122
 www. courts. ca. gov
 The 
 Earnings Withholding Order 
 requires your 
 employer to pay part of your 
 earnings to the sheriff or 
 other levying officer. The 
 levying officer will pay the 
 money to a creditor who ha
 s a court judgment against 
 you. The information belo
 w may help you protect the 
 money you earn. 
 WG 003 Page 1 of 2

 HOW DO YOU ASK FOR AN EXEMPTION? 
 judgment creditor to have a s
 pecified amount withheld each pay period. Complete item 3 on the form to indicate the amount you 
 
 agree to have withheld each pay day during the withholding 
 period. (Be sure it's less than the amount to be withheld otherwise. ) 
 If your creditor accepts your offe
 r, he will not oppose your claim of 
 exemption. (See (1) below. ) 
 2. Fill out both forms. On the forms are some sentences or words
 in front of them. The box means the
 which have boxes 5. Sign the Claim of Exemption and Financial Statement forms. Be
 words which follow may not apply to your case. If the words do 
 apply, put a check in the box. 
 sure the Claim of Exemption form shows the address where you 
 receive mail. 
 6. Mail or deliver two (2) copies 
 of each of the two forms to the levying
 officer. Keep one copy for yourself in case a court hearing is 
 necessary. 3. For example, if your child has
 special medical expenses, tell whichchild, what illnesses, who the doctor is, how often the doctor must 
 be visited, the cost per visit, and the costs of medicines. These 
 
 details should be listed in item 6. 
 If you need more space, put ''See 
 attachment 6'' and attach a typed 8½ by 11 sheet of paper on which 
 
 you have explained your expenses in detail. Do not use the Claim of Exemption and Financial Statement forms to 
 seek a modification of child s
 upport or alimony payments. These 
 payments can be modified only by t
 he family law court that ordered 
 them. 
 FILE YOUR CLAIM OF EXEMPTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR 
 THE MOST PROTECTION. 
 4. You can use the Claim of Exemption form to make an offer to the

 exemption. If this happens, after 10 day
 s the levying officer will tell 
 your employer to stop withholdi
 ng or withhold less from your 
 earnings. The part (or all) of y
 our earnings needed for support will 
 be paid to you or paid as you dire
 ct. And you will get back earnings 
 the levying officer or your empl
 oyer were holding when you asked 
 for the exemption. ŠORŠ (2) The creditor will oppose (object to
 ) your claim of exemption. If this
 happens, you will receive a Notice
 of Opposition and Notice of 
 Hearing on Claim of Exemption, in which the creditor states why 
 
 your exemption should not be allow
 ed. A box in the middle of the 
 Notice of Hearing tells you the time and place of the court hearing 
 
 which will be in about ten days. Be sure to go to the hearing if you 
 
 can. If the judge at the hearing agrees wi
 th you, your employer will be 
 ordered to stop withholding your earni
 ngs or withhold less money. The 
 judge can even order that the 
 EWO
 end before the hearing (so you 
 would get some earnings back) . 
 If the judge does not agree with you, 
 the withholding will continue 
 unless you appeal to 
 a higher court. The rules for appeals are complex so you should see an attorney if you want to appeal. 
 If the judgment creditor has checked t
 he box in item 3 on the Notice of 
 Hearing on Claim of Exemption, the 
 creditor will not be in court. If you 
 are willing to have the court make 
 its decision based on 
 your Financial 
 Statement and the creditor's Notice of Opposition, you need not go to 
 
 the hearing. If you have one court hearing, you s
 hould not file another Claim of 
 Exemption about the same 
 EWO
 unless your finances have gotten worse in an important way. 
 The Notice of Opposition to Claim 
 of Exemption will tell you why the 
 creditor thinks your 
 claim should not be allowed. If you go to the 
 hearing, take any bills, 
 paycheck stubs, cancel
 led checks, or other 
 evidence (including witnes
 ses) that will help If your EWO
 is to be changed or ended, the levying officer must sign 
 the notice to your employer of the change. He may give you 
 
 permission to deliver it to the employer, or it can be mailed. 
 WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR EARNINGS IF 
 YOU FILE A CLAIM OF EXEMPTION? 
 Your employer must continue to hold back part of your earnings for the EWO
 until he receives a notice signed by the levying officer to change the order or end it early. 
 The levying officer will keep your wi
 thheld earnings until your Claim of 
 Exemption is denied or takes effect. At
 that time your earnings will be 
 paid according to the law that applies to your case. REGARDING CHILD SUPPORT
 If you are obligated to make child 
 support payments, the local child 
 support agency may help you to have 
 an Order Assigning Salary or 
 Wages entered. This order has the t
 op priority claim on your earnings. 
 When it is in effect, little or no money may be
 available to be withheld for an 
 EWO
 . And, if the local child support 
 agency is involved in coll
 ecting this support from you, it may agree to 
 accept less money if this special order is entered. WHAT IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS? 
 Also, the office of the Wage and Hour Division of the U. S. Department 
 of Labor may be able to answer some of your questions. Offices are 
 
 listed in the telephone directory under the U. S. Department of Labor in 
 
 the U. S. Government listing. 
 If you cannot see an attorney, or don't want to see an attorney, you might be able to answer some of your
 questions by reading the law in a 
 law library. Ask the law librari
 an to help you find sections 706. 050 and 
 706. 105 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Other sections of the code, beginning with section 706. 010 may also answer some of your 
 
 questions. 
 EMPLOYEE INSTRUCTIONS (Wage Garnishment) 
 WG 003 [Rev. January 2, 2012] 
 Perhaps you can even prove the Noti
 ce of Opposition is wrong. For example, perhaps the Notice of Opposition states that the judgment 
 
 was for wages for a past employee. You may be able to provide 
 
 evidence that the person was not an employee or that the debt was 
 
 not for wages. 1. Call or write the levying office
 r for three (3) copies each of the
 forms called ''Claim of Ex
 emption'' and ''Financial Statement. '' 
 These forms are free. The name and address of the levying officer
 
 are in the big box on the right at the top of the 
 EWO
 . Remember, it is 
 your job to prove with the Financial Statement 
 form that your earnings are needed for support. Write down the 
 
 details about your needs. WG 003 Page 2 of 2</div>
