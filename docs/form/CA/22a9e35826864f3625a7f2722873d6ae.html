FL-398

INFORMATION SHEET FOR COMPLETING AND RESPONDING TO NOTICE OF ACTIVATION 
OF MILITARY SERVICE AND DEPLOYMENT AND REQUEST TO MODIFY A SUPPORT ORDER

If you are the person requesting that the support order be changed:

Please follow these instructions to complete the Notice of Activation of Military Service and Deployment and Request to Modify a 
Support Order if you do not have an attorney to represent you. This form is intended to be used by a service member to ask the court to 
modify support based on his or her military activation and out-of-state deployment.  If you have an attorney, he or she should complete 
this form.  If you would like the local child support agency to assist you, fill out a Notice of Deployment and submit it to the local child 
support agency.  They will prepare a request for modification, and you will not need to appear if you are already deployed.  The local 
child support agency must attach the Notice of Deployment to form FL-398 to show the court that the service member has authorized 
the agency to act on his or her behalf.  You can obtain a Notice of Deployment from any local child support agency.  Please note that 
the child support agency cannot provide services for a modification of spousal support.  

You may also ask to appear by telephone.  See rule 5.324 of the California Rules of Court, and form FL-679 Request for Telephone 
Appearance (Governmental).  If you are in the military, you may also ask for the assistance of a JAG (Judge Advocate General) officer.  

In addition to the modification procedures contained in the Notice of Activation of Military Service and Deployment and Request to 
Modify a Support Order, a service member who has been activated may be eligible for a modification based on a change in 
circumstances, specifically a change in income due to military activation.  To request a modification of support for reasons other than 
out-of-state deployment, see FL-391 Information Sheet—Simplified Way to Change Child, Spousal, or Family Support for what forms to 
use and instructions.  The service member may also have certain protections provided by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).  
Please note that a modification of support cannot be effective any earlier than the filing with the court of the request to modify support.

When you have completed this form, file the original and attachments with the court clerk. The address of the court clerk is listed in the 
telephone directory under “County Government Offices.”  Keep two copies of the filed Notice of Activation of Military Service and 
Deployment and Request to Modify a Support Order form and its attachments. Serve one copy as well as a blank Responsive 
Declaration to Order to Show Cause or Notice of Motion (form FL-320) and blank Income and Expense Declaration (form

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
