       assignment or another mandatory collection process.

INFORMATION SHEET AND INSTRUCTIONS 
FOR REQUEST FOR HEARING REGARDING EARNINGS ASSIGNMENT 
(Do not deliver this information sheet to the court clerk.)

FL-450

Please follow these instructions to complete the Request for Hearing Regarding Earnings Assignment (form FL-450) if you do not have
an attorney representing you. Your attorney, if you have one, should complete this form. You must file the completed Request for Hearing 
form and its attachments with the court clerk within 10 days after the date your employer gave you a copy of Earnings Assignment Order 
for Spousal or Partner Support (form FL-435) or an Income Withholding for Support (form FL-195/OMB0970-0154). The address of the 
court clerk is the same as the one shown for the superior court on the earnings assignment order. You may have to pay a filing fee. If you 
cannot afford to pay the filing fee, the court may waive it, but you will have to fill out some forms first. For more information about the filing 
fee and waiver of the filing fee, contact the court clerk or the family law facilitator in your county.
(TYPE OR PRINT IN INK)
Front page, first box, top of form, left side:  Print your name, address, and telephone number in this box if they are not already there.
Item 1.   a–b. You must contact the court clerk’s office and ask that a hearing date be set for this motion. The court clerk will give you

the information you need to complete this section.

Item 2.   Check this box if you want the court to stop the local child support agency or the other parent from collecting any support from
              your earnings. If you check this box, you must check the box for either a, b, or c beneath it.

a.   Check this box if you are not the person required to pay support in the earnings assignment.
b.   Check this box if you believe that there is "good cause" to recall the earnings assignment. Note: The court must find that

all of the conditions listed in item 2b exist in order for good cause to apply.

c.   Check this box if you and the other parent have a written agreement that allows you to pay the support another way. You
must attach a copy of the agreement, which must be signed by both the other parent and a representative of the local 
child support agency if payments are made to a county office.

Item 3.   Check this box if you want to change the earnings assignment.  If you check this box, you must check the box for either a, b, or

c beneath it.

a.   Check this box if the total arrearages listed in item 9 on the earnings assignment order are wrong.  If you check this box,
you must check one or more of (1), (2), and (3). You must attach the original of your statement of arrearages. Keep one 
copy for yourself.

(1)

  Check this box if you believe the amount of arrearages listed on the earnings assignment order does not give you

credit for all the payments you have made. If you check this box, you must check one or both of the boxes beneath it.
(a) Check this box if you are attaching your own statement of arrearages.  This statement must include a monthly

listing of what you were ordered to pay and what you actually paid.

(b) Check this box if you wish to list any payments that you believe were not included in the arrearages amount. For

each payment you must list the date you paid it, the amount paid, and the person or agency (such as the local child
support agency) to whom you made the payment. Bring to the hearing proof of any payment that is in dispute.

(2) Check this box if the child support for any of the children in the case has been terminated (ended). If you check this 

box, you must list the following information for each child: 
•    The name and birthdate of each child.
•    The date the child support order was terminated.
•    The reason child support was terminated.

(3) Check this box if there is another reason you believe the amount of arrearages is incorrect. You must explain the

b.   Check this box if the total monthly payment shown in item 1 of the earnings assignment order is more than half of your 

reasons in detail.

monthly net income.

c.   Check this box if the total monthly payment shown in item 1 of the earnings assignment order causes you a serious 
      hardship. You must write the reasons for the hardship in this space.

You must date this Request for Hearing form, print your name, and sign the form under penalty of perjury. You must also complete the 
certificate of mailing at the bottom of page 2 of the form by printing the name and address of the other parties in brackets and providing 
a stamped envelope addressed to each of the parties. When you sign this Request for Hearing form, you are stating that the 
information you have provided is true and correct. After you file the request, the court clerk will notify you by mail of the date, time, and 
location of the hearing.

You must file your request within 10 days of receiving the Earnings Assignment Order for Spousal or Partner Support or the 
Income Withholding for Support from your employer. You may file your request in person at the clerk’s office or mail it to the 
clerk. In either event, it must be received by the clerk within the 10-day period.

If you need additional assistance with this form, contact an attorney or the family law facilitator in your county. Your family law facilitator 
can help you, for free, with any questions you have about the above information. For more information on finding a lawyer or family law 
facilitator, see the California Courts Online Self-Help Center at www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/.

NOTICE: Use form FL-450 to request a hearing only if you object to the Income Withholding for Support (form 
FL-195/OMB0970-0154) or Earnings Assignment Order for Spousal or Partner Support (form FL-435). This form will not 
modify your current support amount. (See page 2 of form FL-192, Information Sheet on Changing a Child Support Order.)
