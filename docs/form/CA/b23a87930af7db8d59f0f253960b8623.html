FORM INTERROGATORIES - CONSTRUCTION LITIGATION

CASE NUMBER:

These interrogatories are not intended for use in residential cases involving six or more single-family homes or housing 
units. In cases that have been deemed complex under rule 3.400 et seq. of the California Rules of Court, these 
interrogatories must not be used until the asking party has obtained the court's approval on a showing of good cause.

Section 1. Instructions to All Parties

(a)  Interrogatories are written questions prepared by a party  
to an action and sent to another party in the action to be 
answered under oath in writing. The interrogatories in this 
form are approved for use in residential or commercial 
construction litigation cases, except as limited in section 2.

(b) For time limitations, requirements for service on other 
parties, and other details, see Code of Civil Procedure 
sections 2030.010 -2030.410 and cases construing those 
statutes. 

(c) These form interrogatories do not change existing law 

relating to interrogatories nor do they affect an answering 
party's right to assert any privilege or make any objection, 
including but not limited to any objection recognized by 
statute or case law.

(d)  These form interrogatories are not to be interpreted as 

requiring any information that would invade the attorney-
client privilege or be protected under the doctrines of 
attorney work product or mediation confidentiality. Nor do 
these interrogatories require identification of any 
witnesses or documents protected under such privileges 
or doctrines or otherwise covered by Evidence Code 
section 1115 et seq. (regarding mediation) or Code of Civil 
Procedure section 2034.010 et seq. (regarding expert 
witnesses).

Section 2. Instructions to the Asking Party

(a)  These interrogatories are designed for optional use by 

parties in construction litigation. An asking party who uses 
this form may not use other form interrogatories - such as 
Form Interrogatories–General (form DISC-001) or Form 
Interrogatories–Limited Civil Cases (Economic Litigation) 
(form DISC-004)) in the same action.
These interrogatories are not intended to be used in

(b)

residential cases involving six or more single-family homes 
or housing units. In a case deemed complex under rule 
3.400 et seq. of the California Rules of Court, these 
interrogatories must not be used until the asking party has 
obtained judicial approval on a showing of good cause.
(c) Check the box next to each interrogatory that you want the 
answering party to answer. Use care in choosing only 
those interrogatories that are applicable to the case. 
(d) You may insert your own definition of construction claim  
or construction defect claim in section 4, but only where 
the action arises from a course of conduct or series of 
events occurring over a period of time. 

(e) The interrogatories under 325.0, Defendant's Contentions, 
should not be used until the defendant/cross-defendant 
has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an 
investigation or discovery of the other parties' damages.

(f) Additional non-form interrogatories may be attached. 

Section 3. Instructions to the Answering Party

(a) An answer or other appropriate response must be given to 

each interrogatory checked by the asking party.
(b) Within 30 days after you are served with these  

interrogatories, you must serve your responses on the 
asking party and serve copies of your responses on all 
other parties to the action that have appeared. See Code 
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260 -2030.270 for details.
(c) Each answer must be as complete and straightforward as  
the information reasonably available to you permits, 
including the information possessed by your attorneys or 
agents. If an interrogatory cannot be answered 
completely, answer it to the extent possible.
If you do not have enough personal knowledge to fully  
answer an interrogatory, say so, but make a reasonable

produced documents.

person are requested in more than one interrogatory, you 
need furnish that information only in your response to the 
first interrogatory that asks for it. 

(g)

If you are asserting a privilege or making an objection to 
an interrogatory, you must specifically assert the privilege 
or state the objection in your written response.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
