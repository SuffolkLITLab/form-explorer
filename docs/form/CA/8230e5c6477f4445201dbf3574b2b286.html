      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: How Can I Respond to a Petition for a Gun Violence Restraining Order? Who can ask for a gun violence restraining 
 order? How Can I Respond to a Petition for a Gun Violence Restraining Order? (Gun Violence Prevention) GV 120 INFO, Page 1 of 2 Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov Rev. September 1, 2020, Optional Form 
 Penal Code, § 18150 et seq. GV 120 INFOIt is a court order that temporarily prohibits someone from 
 having any guns, ammunition, or magazines (any 
 ammunition feeding device) . The person must surrender all 
 guns, ammunition, and magazines that he or she currently 
 owns. What is a gun violence restraining order? The petition must have been filed by a: · Law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency, · An employer, · A coworker who has had ﬁregular interactionsﬂ with you for at least a year, · A teacher or employee of a school that you have attended in the last 6 months, or · An immediate family member of yours. Immediate family member is defined by this law to include people who are not blood relatives. The definition includes (1) your spouse or domestic partner; (2) your parents, 
 children, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren and their spouses, including any stepparent or stepgrandparent; (3) your spouses parents, children (your stepchildren) , 
 siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren; and (4) any other person who regularly resides in the household, or who, within the last six months, regularly resided in the household. Yes. Have someone age 18 or olderŠnot youŠmail a copy of completed Response to Petition for Gun Violence Restraining Order (form GV 120) to the person who asked for the order (or that person™s lawyer) . (This is called 
 ﬁservice by mail. ﬂ) 
 
 The person who serves the form by mail must fill out 
 Proof of Service by Mail (form GV 250) . Have the person who did the mailing sign the original. Take the completed 
 form back to the court clerk or bring it with you to the 
 hearing. Do I have to serve the other person with a 
 copy of my response? Will I have to pay a filing fee? No. I've been served with a Petition for Gun Violence Restraining Order. What do I do now? Read the papers served on you very carefully. The Notice of Court Hearing (form GV 109) tells you when to appear 
 in court. There may also be a Temporary Gun Violence Restraining Order (form GV 110) prohibiting you from 
 having any guns, ammunition, or magazines and requiring 
 you to surrender, sell, or store any guns, ammunition, or 
 magazines that you currently own or possess. You must 
 obey the order until the hearing. What if I don't agree with what the 
 order says? If you disagree with the order that the Petitioner is asking 
 for, fill out Response to Petition for Gun Violence Restraining Order (form GV 120) before your hearing date 
 and file it with the court. You can get the form from legal 
 publishers or on the Internet at www. courts. ca. gov. You also may be able to find it at your local courthouse or 
 county law library. If you agree to give up your access to firearms and your 
 rights to own, possess, and buy guns, ammunition, and 
 magazines for the time period requested in the petition, 
 which is between one and five years, then you can fill out 
 Consent to Gun Violence Restraining Order and Surrender 
 of Firearms (form GV 125) and check the box for item 4 a. 
 Make sure you take it to the court clerk and file it, and then 
 mail it to the person or law enforcement agency that 
 applied for the petition. The court will issue the gun 
 violence restraining order before the hearing and remove 
 the hearing from the calendar. You do not have to go to 
 your court date, and the court will mail you a copy of the 
 order. Make sure you check with the court to see if you 
 have to show up for your court date. What if I don't oppose the Petition? What if I don't obey the temporary order? The police can arrest you. You can go to jail and pay a 
 fine. You could lose access to firearms for a longer period 
 of time. For help in your area, contact: [Local information may be inserted. ] What if I am deaf or hard of hearing? Assistive listening systems, computer- assisted real time captioning, or sign 
 language interpreter services are 
 available if you ask at least five court 
 days before the hearing. Contact the 
 clerk™s office or go to 
 www. courts. ca. gov/forms for Request 
 for Accommodations by Persons with Disabilities and Response (form MC 410) . (Civ. Code, § 54. 8. ) How Can I Respond to a Petition for a 
 Gun Violence Restraining Order? GV 120 INFORev. September 1, 2020 GV 120 INFO, Page 2 of 2 How Can I Respond to a Petition for a Gun Violence Restraining Order? (Gun Violence Prevention) When you file your papers, ask your courts€clerk or self help center€if your court will provide an interpreter for you at no cost. If not, you will have to pay a fee for the 
 interpreter. If an interpreter is not available for your court 
 date, you should ask someone who is over age 18 to 
 interpret for you. What if I need help to understand 
 English? Can I agree with the protected person to 
 terminate the order? No. Once the order is issued, only the judge can change or 
 terminate it. You would have to file a request with the 
 court to terminate the order. If the court issued a temporary restraining order before the 
 hearing, it will last until your hearing date. At that time, the 
 court will decide whether to issue a gun violence 
 restraining order that can last for one to five years. Do I need a lawyer? Having a lawyer is always a good idea, but it is not 
 required, and you are not entitled to a free, court appointed 
 attorney. Ask the court clerk about free and low cost legal 
 services and self help centers in your county. How long does the order last? Will I see the person who asked for the order 
 at the court hearing? Can I bring a witness to the court hearing? Assume that the person who is asking for the order will attend the hearing. It is probably best not to talk to them 
 unless the judge or that person™s attorney says that you can. Yes. You can bring witnesses or documents that support your case to the hearing. But if possible, you should also 
 bring the witnesses™ written statements of what they saw or heard. Their statements must be made under penalty of perjury. (You can use Declaration (form MC 030) for this purpose. ) Should I go to the court hearing? Yes. You should go to court on the date listed on Notice of Court Hearing (form GV 109) . If you do not go to the 
 hearing, the judge can extend the order against you for a 
 period between one and five years without hearing from 
 you. </div>
