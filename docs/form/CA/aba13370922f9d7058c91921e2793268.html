 human trafficking; l 6 At the end of my minimum period of 
 registration, where and how do I file my 
 petition and proof of current registration 
 with the court? On or after your next birthday after July 1, 2021, 
 you may file your petition and proof of current 
 registration as a sex offender, which you can get 
 from the registering law enforcement agency, in 
 the superior court in the county where you 
 register. If you register with more than one law 
 enforcement agency (for example, campus 
 registration or additional residence address) , you 
 must file the petition and proof of current 
 registration in the county of your primary 
 residence. l Make a copy of the completed petition and proof 
 of current registration for each law enforcement 
 agency and district attorney™s office you (or 
 someone on your behalf) must serve. l Contact the court clerk or check the court™s 
 website to see if any local rules exist regarding 
 filing and/or service of the petition and proof of 
 current registration and ask how you can receive 
 proof of filing. l File the petition and proof of current registration

 practices, filing them electronically. You were not convicted of a new offense requiring 
 sex offender registration since your release from 
 custody following your conviction for the offense 
 originally giving rise to your duty to register; and l CR 415 INFOInformation on Filing a Petition to Terminate Sex Offender Registration New July 1, 2021 Information on Filing a Petition to Terminate Sex Offender Registration CR 415 INFO, Page 3 of 4 Contact every agency that must be served to check if 
 there is a specific person or mailing address that 
 should receive the petition and proof of current 
 registration. If the agencies do not get a copy, they 
 will not be able to provide the information the court 
 needs to consider your request, and the court may 
 deny the request or delay its decision until it receives 
 this information. There are three main ways to serve the petition and 
 proof of current registration (use Proof of Service (form CR 416) to guide you on the information you 
 need to report back to the court about how and when 
 the petition was served) : l Personal service: You may serve the petition and proof of current registration or ask someone else 
 to do it. Go in person to hand deliver the petition 
 and proof of current registration to a 
 representative of the law enforcement agency and 
 district attorney™s office during business hours. 
 This is the most reliable form of service. l Service by mail: Place copies of the petition and proof of current registration in a stamped, sealed 
 envelope addressed to the law enforcement 
 agency and district attorney™s office. Put first-
 class postage on the envelope and mail it by 
 depositing the envelope with the U. S. Postal 
 Service or at an office or business mail drop 8 Time frame for court™s decision The court will not make a decision until it hears from 
 the law enforcement agency and the district attorney. 
 This may take four months or longer. l The law enforcement agency has 60 days from 
 receipt of the petition to report on your eligibility 
 to the court and district attorney. The law 
 enforcement agency may request more time if it 
 discovers a conviction not previously considered 
 by the Department of Justice. l The district attorney may request a hearing within 
 60 days after receiving the eligibility report from 
 law enforcement. Once you file your petition and proof of current 
 registration and the court gives you a case number, 
 you can see whether the court has received and filed 
 any responses from the law enforcement agency and 
 the district attorney™s office by (1) looking up the 
 case online (if the court offers remote electronic 
 access) , or (2) going in person to the court to review 
 the case docket at a public access kiosk or on a 
 paper file. Your petition may be denied if all law 
 enforcement agencies and district attorney™s 
 offices required to be served are not served. 
 When service is complete, you or someone who 
 served the documents on your behalf must fill out 
 Proof of Service (form CR 416) and file it with the court. If you were convicted of a registrable offense in a 
 different county than where you currently reside 
 and/or register in, the petition and proof of current 
 registration must also be delivered to the law 
 enforcement agency and the district attorney of the 
 county of conviction of the registrable offense. Electronic service: Contact the law enforcement agency and district attorney™s office to check if 
 they accept electronic service and, if so, how to 
 confirm receipt of service. The court may require 
 proof of consent and proof of electronic service. 
 You can use Consent to Electronic Service and 
 Notice of Electronic Service Address (form EFS 005 CV) and Proof of Electronic Service 
 (form EFS 050) , available at www. courts. ca. gov/forms. l Example: If you were convicted of a registrable 
 offense in Los Angeles County but register in 
 Orange County, you or someone on your behalf 
 must serve the law enforcement agency and the 
 district attorney™s office in both counties. l The district attorney in the county in which you 
 currently register. where the mail is picked up every day and 
 deposited with the U. S. Postal Service. 
 Alternatively, you may mail the documents by 
 certified mail with a return receipt requested. l The law enforcement agency with which you 
 currently register; and If the district attorney does not request a hearing, the court must grant the petition for termination if 
 (1) you provided proof of current registration, (2) the 
 registering law enforcement agency reported that 
 you met the requirements for termination, (3) there 
 are no pending charges against you that could extend 
 the time to complete the registration requirements of 
 the tier or change your tier status, and (4) you are not 
 in custody or on parole, probation, or supervised 
 release. CR 415 INFOInformation on Filing a Petition to Terminate Sex Offender 
 Registration New July 1, 2021 Information on Filing a Petition to Terminate Sex Offender Registration CR 415 INFO, Page 4 of 410 Subsequent petition If the court denies your request, it will let you know 
 how much time must pass before you can make the 
 request again. This depends in part on your tier. l Tier 1 and 2 (Adult) : At least one year from date 
 of denial, but not to exceed five years, based on 
 facts presented at the hearing. l Tier 2 (10 year registration exception) : At least 
 one year from date of denial. l Tier 3 (based on risk level) : At least three years 
 from date of denial. 9 Hearing The district attorney in the county where the petition 
 is filed may request a hearing if the district attorney 
 does not believe you have registered for the 
 minimum time period required or if it believes that 
 you should continue registering for community 
 safety. A community safety hearing is required in 
 order for the court to grant a Tier 2 10 year 
 exception or Tier 3 risk level petition. If the court 
 must decide at the hearing whether you should 
 continue to register for community safety, the court 
 will make its decision by reviewing the facts of your 
 case, your conduct before and after the conviction, 
 and your current risk or sexual or violent re offense, 
 among other factors. The court may grant your request, deny your 
 request, or set the request for a hearing if one is 
 requested by the district attorney. </div>
