      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: CH 100 INFOCan a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me? What is a civil harassment restraining order? It is a court order that helps protect people from 
 harassment. Can I get a civil harassment restraining 
 order? You can ask for one if you are worried about your 
 safety because someone: Ł Is harassing youŁ Is stalking youŁ Has committed acts of violence against you, or Ł Has threatened you with violence How will the order help me? The court can order a person to: Not harass or threaten you Not contact or go near you, and Not have a gun What forms do I need to get the order? You must fill out all of Form CH 100, Request for Civil Harassment Restraining Orders, and Form CLETS 001, Confidential CLETS Information. If you need attachments, you may use Form MC 025. You must also 
 fill out items 1 and 2 on Form CH 109, Notice of Court Hearing, and items 1, 2, and 3 on Form CH 110, 
 Temporary Restraining Order (CLETS) . Where can I get these forms? Judicial Council of California www. courts. ca. gov Revised July 1, 2014, Optional Form 
 Code of Civil Procedure, § 527. 6 Can a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me? (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 100 INFO, Page 1 of 3 You can also ask for protection for people who live with 
 you and family members. What do I need to do to get the order? You must go to the superior court in the county where 
 the harassment took place or the person to be restrained 
 lives. At the court, ask where you should file your 
 request for a civil harassment restraining order. (A self-
 help center or legal aid association may be able to assist 
 you in filing your request. ) At the court, give your forms to the clerk of the court. The clerk will give you a hearing date on the Notice of Court Hearing form, and if your request for immediate 
 orders is granted, a copy of the Temporary Restraining Order signed by a judicial officer. In a civil harassment case, the court cannot: Ł Order a person to move out of your residenceŁ Order a person to pay child support to youŁ Make orders for custody and visitation If you need these orders, you should proceed under the 
 Domestic Violence Protection Act. File Form DV 100. The court also cannot: If you need these remedies, you must file a civil action. These instructions cannot cover all of the questions that may arise in a particular case. If you do not know what to do to protect your rights, you should see a lawyer. Ł Order a person to pay money that he or she owes 
 youŁ Order someone to move out of rental property 
 that you ownŁ Order someone to stop creating a nuisance that 
 doesn't involve harassment You can get the forms from legal publishers or on the 
 Internet at www. courts. ca. gov. You also may be able to find them at your local courthouse or county law library. How much does it cost? That depends on the type of harassment. If the restrained 
 person has used or threatened to use violence against 
 you or has stalked you, you do not have to pay a filing 
 fee; otherwise, you must pay the fee. 
 
 If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, ask the clerk 
 how to apply for a fee waiver. Form FW 001 is available 
 for this purpose. 
 
 If the order is based on prior acts of violence, a credible 
 threat of violence, or stalking, you are entitled to free 
 service of the order by a sheriff or marshal. Also, if you 
 are eligible for a fee waiver, you can ask the sheriff or 
 marshal to serve the order for free. If you are not eligible 
 for free service, you may pay the sheriff or marshal to 
 serve the order. Ł Ł Ł Do I have to go to court? Yes. Go to court on the date the clerk gives you. Do I need a lawyer? Rev. July 1, 2014 Can a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me? (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 100 INFO, Page 2 of 3 Having a lawyer is always a good idea, but it is not required and you are not entitled to a free court-
 appointed attorney. Ask the court clerk about free and 
 low cost legal services and self help centers in your county. What if the restrained person does not obey the order? Call the police. The restrained person can be arrested 
 and charged with a crime. How soon can I get the order? If you ask for a temporary restraining order, the court 
 will decide within 24 hours whether or not to make the 
 order. Sometimes the court decides sooner. Ask whether 
 you should wait or come back later to get the signed 
 Notice of Court Hearing and Temporary Restraining Order. How long does the order last? If the court makes a temporary order, it will last until 
 your hearing date. At that time, the court will decide to 
 continue or cancel the order. The order could last for up 
 to five years. How will the person to be restrained know 
 about the order? Someone age 18 or olderŠnot you or anyone else to be protected by the orderŠmust ﬁserveﬂ (give) the person 
 to be restrained a copy of the order. The server must then 
 fill out Form CH 200, Proof of Personal Service, and give it to you to file with the court. For help with 
 service, ask the court clerk for Form CH 200 INFO, 
 What Is ﬁProof of Personal Service? ﬂ. The court may or may not let witnesses speak at the 
 hearing. So, if possible, you should bring their written 
 statements under oath to the hearing. (You can use 
 Form MC 030, Declaration, for this. ) . Do I need to bring a witness to the court 
 hearing? Witnesses are not required, but it helps to have more 
 proof of the harassment than just your word. You can 
 bring: Ł WitnessesŁ Written statements from witnesses made under oathŁ PhotosŁ Medical or police reportsŁ Damaged propertyŁ Threatening letters, e mails, or telephone messages Will I see the restrained person at the court 
 hearing? If the person comes to the hearing, yes. But that person 
 does not have the right to speak to you. If you are afraid, 
 tell the court officer. Can I bring someone with me to court? Yes. You can bring someone to sit with you during the 
 hearing. But that person cannot speak for you in court. 
 Only you or your lawyer (if you have one) can speak for 
 you. CH 100 INFOCan a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me? What if I am deaf or hard of hearing? For help in your area, contact: [Local information may be inserted. ] Assistive listening systems, computer assisted real time 
 captioning, or sign language 
 interpreter services are available if 
 you ask at least five days before the 
 hearing. Contact the clerk™s office or 
 go to www. courts. ca. gov/forms for 
 Request for Accommodations by Persons with Disabilities and Response (Form MC 410) . 
 (Civ. Code, § 54. 8. ) Can I agree with the restrained person to 
 cancel the order? No. Once the order is issued, only the judge can change 
 or cancel it. You or the restrained person would have to 
 file a request with the court to cancel the order. What if I don't speak English? When you file your papers, ask the clerk if a court 
 interpreter is available. You may have to pay a fee for 
 the interpreter. If an interpreter is not available for your 
 court date, you should ask someone who is not listed as a 
 person to be protected on your Request and who is over 
 age 18 to interpret for you . CH 100 INFOCan a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me? Rev. July 1, 2014 Can a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me? (Civil Harassment Prevention) CH 100 INFO, Page 3 of 3</div>
