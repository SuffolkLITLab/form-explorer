      <pre>DV-505-INFO How to Ask for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order

 Part 1: Complete court forms

Tips for completing form DV-100

You will need to complete at least three forms to ask for 
a domestic violence restraining order:

Required forms:

• Form DV-100;

• Form DV-109; and

• Form DV-110.

Optional forms:
If you have a child or children with the other 
side, you can ask for additional protection, like 
child custody orders. To make these requests, 
you must complete two more forms:
• Form DV-105; and

• Form DV-140.

If you want to ask for child support or spousal 
support, make the request on form DV-100 
(see item       or       )  and complete one more 
form: 

25

24

• Form FL-150.

Most court forms are public documents. 
What does "public" mean?

When you file papers with the court, those papers 
become "public." This means that anyone may ask the 
court to see the information you put on your papers. 
Also, the person you are asking for protection from 
will see all the information on your court papers, 
because you will have to have these papers personally 
”
delivered to the them. This is called    personal service, 
and more information is available on form DV-200-
INFO, What Is "Proof of Personal Service"?

“ 

How old must I be to ask for my own 
restraining order against someone?

To ask for a restraining order, you must be 12 years old 
or older. In some cases, the judge may ask that an adult 
(someone 18 years old or older), like a trusted relative, 
help you in your case.

3

Required relationship
At item      , you must have one of the listed 
relationships between you and the person you want 
protection from. If none apply, go to https://selfhelp.
courts.ca.gov/restraining-orders. for information on 
other types of restraining orders you might qualify for.

Describe the abuse
5 – 7
At items             , you must describe the abuse that 
happened. This part is important, because a judge will 
decide whether to give you a restraining order based on 
the information you give. For more information of 
what abuse means under the law, see form DV-500-
INFO, Can A Domestic Violence Restraining Order 
Help Me?

I don't want people to see my address

1

You may not want someone to be able to see certain 
information, like your address. You do not have to 
give the address to where you live on form DV-100, 
item      . You can use a different address, like a 
friend's address or P.O. box. Just be sure to get the 
person's permission to use their address first, because 
any papers the court or other side mails to you will go 
to the address you list in item      . And make sure that 
person will tell you right away if you get mail from 
the court.

1

I don't want people to see information I 
provide about a child (minor)

You can ask the court to make some of the information 
you provide about a child private (confidential). If the 
court makes information about a child private, the 
public will not be able to see this information on your 
court papers. See form DV-160-INFO for help with 
asking the court to make a child's information private.

Restraining Order 
(Domestic Violence Prevention)

DV-505-INFO How to Ask for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order

What if the other side has firearms (guns) 
or ammunition?

9

In item      , list information you have about any 
firearms (guns), firearm parts, or ammunition that the 
other side might own or have access to. This 
information is important to the judge. The judge can 
notify law enforcement about any firearms, including 
illegal or untraceable firearms called “ghost guns.”   
Once notified, law enforcement must do what they can 
to get the firearms if there is a restraining order in place.

What is a "Batterer Intervention 
Program" (item       )?27
In most cases, it is a year-long program that helps a 
person recognize abusive behavior so that they will 
stop the abuse. Unlike anger management programs, 
the goal of batterer intevention programs is to stop a 
person from using power and control in their 
relationships. If ordered to complete the program by a 
judge, the restrained person will have to pay program 
fees. The program will keep track of progress and 
attendance. 

What does "Other orders" (item       ) mean?

14

This section allows you to make any special requests 
that you need to prevent more abuse by the other side. 

What is the difference between "Pay Debts 
Owed for Property (item       ) and "Pay 
Expenses Caused by the Abuse (item       )?

22

23

If you want the other side to pay a debt owed for 
property, like a car or mortgage, you can make this 
request at item      . If you want the other person to pay 
you back for damage that happened because of their 
abuse, like breaking your cellphone or for medical bills, 
you can make this request at item      .

22

23

What is "Spousal Support" (item       )? 

25

If you are married to the person you want protection 
from or in a registered domestic partnership, you can 
ask a judge to order them to pay you spousal support. 
The amount of spousal support depends on different 
factors, including how much you make versus how 
much the other side makes. It is important to know that 
in California, you cannot get spousal support for 
"common law" marriages, where parties have lived like 
a married couple but never  legally married. California 
does not recognize "common law" marriage. 

 Part 2: File your court papers

Filing is when you turn in your completed court papers 
to the court. To file your court papers, you can call the 
court clerk to see find out which courthouse to go to. If 
you want to file online (e-file), check your local court's 
website for more information. To find your local court 
or their website, go to:  
www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm.

 Part 3: Get your papers from court

After you turn in your court papers, you will need to 
get them back from the court. Your papers will be 
ready the same day or the next business day. Ask the 
court clerk when your court papers will be ready. You 
may have to return to the courthouse to pick up your 
papers if the court cannot return them to you 
electronically. Look at your papers to see if the judge 
granted you a temporary restraining order, on form 
DV-110. 

u If the judge granted you temporary protection 
and you want it to last longer, make sure you 
attend your court hearing (listed on form 
DV-109).

u If the judge did not grant you a temporary 
restraining order, the judge can grant you a 
restraining order at your court hearing (listed on 
form DV-109).

Part 4: Have someone serve your papers

Where can I find free help? 

You must have an adult personally give a copy of all 
your court papers to the person you want a restraining 
order against. It cannot be you or anyone listed on the 
restraining order. Serving papers can be a dangerous 
situation. If you want the sheriff to serve your papers, 
they will do so for free. For more information on 
service, read form DV-200-INFO, What Is "Proof of 
Personal Service"? 
 

Free legal help is available at your court's self-help 
center. Find your local court's self-help center at  
www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp. Self-help center staff 
will not act as your lawyer but may be able to give 
you information to help you decide what to do in your 
case, and help you with the forms. Staff may also 
refer you to other agencies who may be able to help 
you.

What if I am worried about my safety?

The National Domestic Violence Hotline provides free 
and private safety tips. Help is available every day, 24 
hours a day, and in over 100 languages. Visit online at  
www.thehotline.org or 
call 1-800-799-7233; 1-800-787-3224 (TTY).

Part 5: Get ready for and go to your 
court hearing

At your court hearing, the judge will decide whether to 
grant you a long-term restraining order that can last up 
to five years. You have the option of attending your 
hearing in-person or remotely (by phone, or 
videoconference if available). For information on how to 
attend your hearing remotely, go to the court's website. 
Some courts may require advance notice. At the hearing, 
you and the other side will have the opportunity to tell 
your side of the story. For more information, read form 
DV-520-INFO, Get Ready for the Restraining Order 
Court Hearing. If you need more time to prepare your 
case, you may ask for a new court date. Read form 
DV-115-INFO, How to Ask For a New Hearing Date, 
for more information.

available online
