Bring evidence or witnesses to your court 
hearing

If you have evidence or witnesses, read the information 
below. Bringing evidence or witnesses is optional and 
not required. Your statements alone can be proof for 
your case. If you are the person asking for the 
restraining order you will have to convince the judge 
that abuse occurred. The judge will make a decision 
based on all evidence and statements made by both 
sides. 

•  Evidence: Evidence can include pictures, emails, 

medical records showing injuries, police reports, etc. 
If you have evidence, you will need to make it 
available to the judge and other side to see. 
Sometimes the judge cannot look at or consider 
certain documents. The judge will decide which 
documents can be included in your case. If you are 
attending court in person, bring three copies of your 
written evidence, if you have not already filed and 
served it on the other side. If you have evidence and 
want to attend your court date by phone or 
videoconference, contact your local self-help center 
for information on how to share your evidence with 
the judge and other side.

•  Witnesses: You can ask the judge to allow witnesses 
to speak at your court hearing. If you have a lot of 
witnesses, you may need to complete paperwork 
before your court hearing. Ask your local self-help 
center for more information.

Make arrangements before your court  
hearing

•  If you or a witness wants to attend court 
remotely (by phone or videoconference)

Check the court's website as soon as possible to see 
what you need to do to attend remotely.  You can 
use www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm to find 
your court's website.

•  Court interpreter: If you need an interpreter, use 
form INT-300 to request an interpreter or ask the 
court clerk how you can request one. You can also 
use this form to ask for an interpreter for a witness. 

•  Childcare: Find childcare because court may take 
all morning or afternoon, even all day. Some courts 
have a Children’s Waiting Room, a safe place for 
children to wait while parents are in court. You can 
check with your court in advance to see if this is 
available.

•  Support person: You can have someone attend 
court with you. The person you bring cannot 
speak for you but can sit next to you when your 
case is called (if you attend in person). If you 
attend by videoconference, your support person 
can also attend with you. 

•  Disability accommodation: You may use form 

MC-410 to request assistance. Contact the 
disability/ADA coordinator at your local court for 
more information.

Request for Accommodations 

Assistive listening systems, computer-
assisted real-time captioning, or sign 
language interpreter services are available 
if you ask at least five days before the 
hearing. Contact the clerk’s office or go 
to www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm for 
Disability Accommodation Request (form 
MC-410). (Civil Code section 54.8.)

Tips for your court hearing

What will happen during my case?

Plan what you want to say to the judge
It may help to plan out and make notes about what you 
want to say to the judge. If needed, you can use your 
notes for your court hearing. Read over the court papers 
in your case and write out anything else you want the 
judge to know. Focus on the facts and details that 
support your side of the story. Go over any papers you 
received from the other side. Try to understand what 
they are asking for and arguing in the case (their 
allegations). If you do not agree, tell the judge. Think 
about and write down how you want to defend against 
their arguments

Attend early and safely 
Show up or call in to your hearing early. If you are  
attending online, practice using the technology, like 
Zoom, before your court date. If you are late, you may 
miss your case being called. If you might be late, try to 
call the court right away to let courtroom staff know that 
you will be late.
u If you attend in person, do not sit near or talk to the 

other person. If you are afraid of the other person, tell 
the officer who is in the courtroom. 

u If you attend by videoconference, and you don't want 
the other side to see where you are or your phone 
number (if you call in), talk with an advocate about 
how to safely attend using videoconference. This 
may include using a virtual background or using 
another phone number to call in. You can contact the 
National Domestic Violence Hotline for free help. 
See page 4 for information.

Follow courtroom rules
Here are some common rules:
•  Put your cellphone on silent mode, if you're 

attending in person.
Do not eat or drink during your hearing, except for 
water. 

• 

•  Do not wear a hat or sunglasses on your head. 
•  When speaking to the judge, call the judge “Your 

honor” or “judge”. 

•  Don’t interrupt anyone who is speaking.
•  Wait until it's your turn to speak and let the judge 

know you want a chance to speak.

The judge will give both sides time to speak 
Usually, the judge asks the person who wants the 
restraining order to talk first. No matter who talks first, 
you will both get a chance to speak. Attending court 
can be difficult and stressful but it is important not to 
talk over anyone. If you have something to say and it 
is not your turn, let the person finish talking and then 
ask the judge for permission to speak.  

The judge will reschedule your court hearing or 
make a decision

u There are a few reasons why the judge may have 
rescheduled your court date. This is called a 
continuance. Here are some examples: 

•  Person asking for the restraining order did not 
serve the other side in time (by the deadline). 

•  The judge needs to set aside more time to hear 

your case.

•  If the restrained person has not filed a response 

(form DV-120) and asks for more time to 
prepare for the case, the judge must grant their 
request if they ask for one at the first court date. 

If the judge reschedules your court date, the judge 
will usually extend the temporary restraining order, 
if one was granted. If the judge reschedules your 
court date, make sure you get a new order (form  
DV-116, Order on Request to Continue Hearing).

u If the restraining order is denied, this means that the 

judge has decided that there was not enough 
evidence to prove that abuse happened. This means 
that your restraining order case is finished and any 
temporary protection expires.

u If the restraining order is granted, this means that the 
judge has decided that there is enough evidence to 
prove that abuse happened. You should go over the 
restraining order to make sure you understand all the 
orders. See the next page for information on next 
steps.

What do I do after a restraining order is 
granted?

If you've had your day in court and the judge granted 
you a long-term restraining order, you may have a 
couple more steps to take. Make sure all steps are 
completed as soon as possible. If you do not, the 
police may not be able to enforce your restraining 
order.

q
Protected person:

1 Your restraining order will be on form DV-130, 

Restraining Order After Hearing. If you don't have 
a form DV-130 that is signed by the judge, check 
with the clerk to see if one was filed. If it has, ask 
for a copy. If one has not been filed, you will need 
to fill out: 

•  Form DV-130 (required).

•  Form DV-140, Child Custody and Visitation 
Order (required if court made orders for your 
children).

•  Form FL-342, Child Support Information and 
Order Attachment, or form FL-343, Spousal, 
Domestic Partner, or Family Support Order 
Attachment, if the judge orders child support or 
spousal support. 

2 Turn in your completed form(s) to the court clerk. 
The clerk will then give it to the judge to review 
and sign. You will need to pick it up once it is 
signed. Ask the court clerk when your forms will 
be ready. There is no fee for turning in this form, 
and you should receive some free copies.

3 Look at form DV-130 to see if the judge ordered 
you to serve the form by mail or in person. If you 
are ordered to serve the form by mail, this means 
your server only has to mail a copy of the 
restraining order. But, serving someone in person 
is always best. When you mail court papers, it may 
be hard to prove that the person actually received a 
copy especially if the person moves a lot. Learn 
more about service at: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.
gov/DV-restraining-order/serve-longterm-order.

q

Restrained person:

1 You must obey orders the judge makes. The 
orders will be on form DV-130, Restraining 
Order After Hearing. If you do not obey them, 
you could be arrested, or convicted of a crime.

2 If you have any prohibited items (firearms 

(guns), firearm parts, ammunition), you must 
bring all items to a licensed gun dealer or police. 
For more information, read form DV-800-
INFO/JV-270-INFO, How Do I Turn In, Sell, or 
Store My Firearms, Firearm Parts, and 
Ammunition? The information is also available 
online at: www.selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/respond-
to-DV-restraining-order/obey-firearms-orders.

What if I have a child with the other side?

Where can I find a self-help center?

Find your local court's self-help center at  
www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp. Self-help center staff will 
not act as your lawyer but may be able to give you 
information to help you decide what to do in your case. 

Where can I find other help?

The National Domestic Violence Hotline provides 
free and private safety tips. Help is available every 
day, 24 hours a day, and in over 100 languages. 
Visit online at www.thehotline.org or 
call 1-800-799-7233; 1-800-787-3224 (TTY).

If you ask for child custody or visitation (parenting 
time) orders, the judge may have you meet with a court 
professional to see if you and the other parent can agree 
on parenting time. This process is called "mediation." 
You can ask to meet separately and not with the other 
side in your case. Ask the court staff how you can 
make this request. For more information on mediation, 
go to: www.selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/child-custody/what-
to-expect-mediation.

What happens if I don't attend the court 
hearing?

u If you asked for a restraining order and you do not 
attend the hearing, any protection you have in this 
case will expire. If the other side attends the hearing 
and you don't, the judge could make some orders 
against you, like lawyer's fees. To get another 
restraining order, you would have to fill out and file 
a new set of forms. If you've changed your mind 
and no longer want a restraining order, talk with 
self-help center staff or a lawyer.

u If someone asked for a restraining order against you, 
and you do not attend the hearing, a judge may grant 
a restraining order against you without hearing your 
side. The order can last for up to five years, and can 
include orders regarding children or property that 
you have with the person asking for protection.

also available online
