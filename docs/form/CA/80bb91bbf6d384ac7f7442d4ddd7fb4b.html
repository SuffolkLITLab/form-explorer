 her. If the hearing is about getting a restraining order against you: Go to the hearing! If you miss it, the judge can make orders without hearing your side. Read DV 120 INFO, How Can I Respond to a Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order?

 clerk for help right away. Or talk to your lawyer, if you
