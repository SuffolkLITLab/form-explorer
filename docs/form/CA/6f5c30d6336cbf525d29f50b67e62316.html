      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: INFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST AND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT Under California law, the amount recoverable by a judgment creditor includes: Costs After Judgment A judgment creditor is entitled to reimbursement for the ﬁreasonable and necessaryﬂ costs of enforcing a judgment. These costs must be reported to the court within two years of the date incurred. The judgment amount includes costs ordered by 
 the court after the judgment. (For information on recovering costs and a detailed list of costs that can be recovered see 
 Code of Civil Procedure sections 685. 040, 685. 050 et seq. , 685. 070 (b) , and 685. 090; see also ﬁRequesting Costs and 
 Interestﬂ below) . Crediting Payments Received MC 013 INFO l Form Approved for Optional Use Judicial Council of California MC 013 INFO [New January 1, 2018] INFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST AND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENTMC 013 INFOPage 1 of 2 The total amount of the judgment entered by the court (principal) , plus costs; What can the judgment creditor recover? Accrued Interest (See Code Civ. Proc. , §§ 685. 010, 685. 020 (a) , and Cal. Const. , art. XV, § 1. ) Interest accrues on an unpaid judgment amount at the legal rate of 10% per year (7% if the judgment debtor is a state or local government entity) generally from the date of entry of the judgment. Interest begins to accrue on the amount of costs 
 added to a judgment from the date ordered by the court or from the date costs are allowed following expiration of the time 
 to object. (Code Civ. Proc. , § 685. 070 (d) . ) Also, upon renewal of a judgment, interest begins to accrue on the day the 
 renewed judgment is entered. If the judgment is payable in installments, interest accrues from the date each installment is 
 due. Any payments received by the judgment creditor must be ﬁcreditedﬂ in a specific order. (Code Civ. Proc. , § 695. 220. ) After specific costs go directly to the levying officer and to the court for fees, the judgment creditor is required to credit 
 payments received first toward accrued interest and then toward the judgment principal (including costs approved by the court after entry of the judgment) . Calculation of Interest on Judgment and Amount Due Following are various formulas and examples to assist with the calculation of interest on a judgment using a 10% interest rate: Calculating Daily Interest on a Judgment Using 10% Interest Ratel Following is the formula for figuring out the amount of interest earned per day on a judgment. Formula: Total amount of judgment owed x 10% (or 0. 10) = interest earned per year. 
 Divide that number by 365 = daily interest earned. Example: Judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5, 000 (the ﬁjudgment principalﬂ) . $5, 000 x 0. 10 = $500 
 $500/365 = $1. 37 daily interest The amount of interest earned will be $1. 37 per day as long as the unpaid amount remains $5, 000. Calculating the Total Amount Due, Including Interest, on the date of payment Step 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment. This amount will equal the daily interest rate calculated above, multiplied by the number of days since the court entered the final judgment. Figure out the total number of days that have passed since the court entered the final judgment up to the day of 
 payment. Multiply the total days by the amount of daily interest. The result is the amount of interest owing on the day of payment. Costs after judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 685. 070; and Requesting Costs and Interest To have costs and interest added to the enforceable amount owed, the judgment creditor must file and serve a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment (form MC 012) . On this form, the judgment creditor must include the exact amount of all costs and accrued interest. This means the judgment creditor is responsible for calculating the amount of 
 interest that accrues on the judgment. It is useful to update this calculation after receiving payments. Accrued interest on the total amount. ll 1. 2. MC 013 INFO [New January 1, 2018] Page 2 of 2 MC 013 INFO INFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST AND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENTThe judgment debtor owes $137 in interest on the principal of $5, 000 on the date of payment. Step 2: Add the amount of interest that has accrued to the amount of the judgment. $5, 000 judgment amount + $137 interest = $5, 137. The judgment debtor owes a total of $5, 137 on the 100 th day after the court entered the judgment. Crediting Partial Payments and Recalculating the Amount Duel If the judgment debtor does not pay all that is owed at one time, the partial payments the debtor makes are credited 
 to the interest first and then to the judgment amount (the principal) owed. Example: Judgment principal of $5, 000. Step 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment Following the above example: $1. 37 per day x 200 days. After 200 days, $274 in interest will have accrued on the $5, 000 judgment (200 days x $1. 37 per day) . Step 2: Apply payment to interest The debtor paid $1, 000, which must first be used to credit the $274 of accrued interest. 
 That leaves a balance of $726 to be credited toward the $5, 000 principal ($1, 000 - $274 = $726) . Step 3: Apply remainder to principal The remaining credit of $726 is applied to the $5, 000 judgment principal ($5, 000 - $726 = $4, 274) . 
 The judgment debtor now owes $4, 274 on the judgment principal. Step 4: Calculate the new daily interest rate Daily interest would then accrue at a rate of $1. 17/day. 
 $4, 274 x 10% = $427. 40 interest earned per year. 
 $427. 40/365 = $1. 17 interest earned per day. The amount of interest that accrues in the next 100 days: 
 100 days x $1. 17 = $117. The new daily interest would then accrue on the principal going forward at a rate of $1. 07/day: 
 $3, 891 x 10% = $389. 10/365. Example: Assume a $5, 000 judgment was entered on June 1 and paid on September 8; 100 days from the entry of 
 the judgment have passed. The daily interest is $1. 37 (see above calculation) . 
 $1. 37 per day x 100 days = $137 interest owed on the date of payment. l First Payment: After 200 days, the judgment debtor pays $1, 000 l Second Payment: After 100 days, a payment of $500 is made (calculate using steps 1Œ4) 1. 2. 3. The credit of $383 is then subtracted from the judgment principal of $4, 274, leaving an unpaid balance of $3, 891. The payment of $500 must first be credited towards the interest of $117, leaving a balance of $383 to be 
 credited against the principal ($500 - $117 = $383) . 4. </div>
