 Information on Appeal Procedures for Infractions
 This information sheet tells you about appeals in 
 infraction
 cases. 
 It is only meant to give you a general 
 idea of the appeal process, so it
 does not cover 
 everything you may need to know about appeals in 
 
 infraction
 cases. To learn more, you should 
 read rules 
 8. 900Œ8. 929
 of the California Rules of Court, which set 
 out the procedures for 
 infraction
 appeals. 
 You can get 
 these rules at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/rules
 . Infractions are crimes that can be puni
 shed
 by a fine, 
 traffic school, or some form of community service but 
 
 not by 
 time in jail or prison
 . (See Penal Code sections 
 17, 19. 6, and 19. 8. 
 You can get a copy of these laws at 
 http: //leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/
 faces/codes. xhtml
 . ) Examples of infracti
 ons are many traffic violations for 
 which you can get a ticket or violations of some city or 
 county ordinances for which you can get a citation. 
 If 
 you were also charged with or convicted of a 
 misdemeanor, then your case is a misdemeanor case, not 
 an infra
 ction case. 
 An appeal is a request to a higher court to review a 
 ruling or 
 decision made by a lower court. 
 In a
 n infraction
 case, the court hearing the appeal
 is the 
 appellate division of the superior court
 , and the lower 
 court
 Šcalled 
 the 
 ﬁtrial court
 ﬂ in this information 
 sheet
 Šis the superior court. 
 It is important to understand that 
 an appeal is 
 NOT
 a new trial
 . The appellate division will not consider new 
 evidence, such as the testimony of new witnesses or new 
 exhibits. The appellate division™s job 
 is to review a 
 record of what happened in the trial court and the trial 
 court™s decision to see if certain kinds of legal errors 
 were made in the case: 
 Prejudicial error: 
 The party that appeals (called the 
 ﬁappellantﬂ) may ask the appellate division to 
 determine if an error was made about either the law 
 or court procedures in the case that caused 
 
 substantial harm to the appellant (this is called
 ﬁprejudicial errorﬂ) . Prejudicial error can includ
 e things like errors made by the judge about t
 he law or 
 errors or misconduct by the lawyers that harmed the 
 appellant. When it conducts its review, the appellate 
 division presumes that the 
 judgment, order, or other 
 decision being appealed is correct. 
 It is the 
 responsibility of the appellant to show t
 he appellate 
 division that an error was made and that the error 
 
 was harmful. 
 No substantial evidence: 
 The appellant may also ask 
 the appellate division to determine if there was 
 substantial evidence supporting the judgment, order, 
 or other decision being 
 appealed. When it conducts 
 its review, the appellate division only looks to see if 
 there was evidence that 
 reasonably 
 supports the 
 decision. The appellate division generally will not 
 
 reconsider the trial court
 ™s conclusion about which 
 side ha
 d more or stro
 nger evidence or whether 
 witnesses were telling the truth or lying. 
 The appellate division generally will not overturn the 
 judgment, order, or other decision being appealed 
 unless the record clearly shows that one of these legal 
 errors was made. 
 You
 do not 
 have
 to have a lawyer; you are allowed to 
 represent yourself in an appeal in 
 an infraction 
 case. But 
 appeals can be complicated
 , and you will have to follow 
 the same rules that lawyers have to follow. If you have 
 any questions about the appeal proc
 edures, you should 
 talk to a lawyer. 
 You will need to hire a lawyer yourself 
 if you want one. You can get information about finding a
 lawyer on the California Courts Online Self

 8 If you are repres
 enting yourself, you must 
 put your 
 address, telephone number, 
 fax number
 (if available) 
 , and e
 -mail address (if available) on the cover of every 
 document you file with the court and let the court know 
 if 
 this
 contact information changes so that the court c
 an 
 contact you if needed. 
 Only a party in the trial court case can appeal a decision 
 in that case. You may not appeal on behalf of
 a friend
 , a 
 spouse, a child, or another relative. 
 The party that 
 is appeal
 ing
 is called the APPELLANT; 
 in an infraction 
 case, this is usually the 
 party convicted 
 of committing the infraction. The other party is called 
 
 the RESPONDENT; in an infraction case, this is usually 
 the 
 government agency that 
 filed the criminal charges
 (on court papers, this party is 
 called
 the People
 of the 
 State of California) . 
 
 
 No. Generally, you may appeal only a final judgment of 
 the trial court
 Šthe decision at the end that decides the 
 whole case. The final judgment includes the punishment 
 that the court i
 mposed. 
 Other rulings made by the tri
 al 
 court before final judgment cannot be separately 
 
 appealed, but can be reviewed only 
 later as 
 part of an 
 appeal 
 of the final judgment. 
 In an infraction
 case
 , the 
 party that was convicted of committing an inf
 raction
 usually appeals that conviction or the 
 sentence (the fine 
 
 or other punishment) ordered by the trial court. In an 
 infraction case, a party can also appeal from an order 
 made by the trial court after judgment that affects a 
 substantial right of the appellant (Penal Code section 
 1466 (2) (B) . 
 You ca
 n get a copy of this law at 
 http: //leginfo. legislature. ca. gov/
 faces/codes. xhtml
 . ) First, you must file a notice of appeal. The notice of 
 appeal tells the other party in the case and the trial court 
 that you are appealing the trial court™s decision. Yo
 u may use 
 Notice of Appeal and Record 
 on Appeal 
 (Infraction) 
 (form CR
 -142) to prepare and file a notice 
 of appeal in a
 n infraction
 case. You can get
 form CR
 -142 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/forms
 . htm. 
 
 Yes. 
 In an infraction case, you must file your notice of 
 appeal within 
 30 days
 after the trial court makes 
 (ﬁrendersﬂ) its judgment in your case or issues the order 
 
 you are appealing. The date the trial court makes its 
 judgment is normally the date the trial c
 ourt orders you 
 to pay a fine or orders other punishment in your case 
 (sentences you) . 
 This deadline for filing the notice of 
 appeal cannot be extended. If your notice of appeal is 
 late, 
 the appellate division will not be able to consider 
 your appeal. 
 To file the notice of appeal in an infraction case, you 
 must bring or mail the original notice of appeal to the 
 clerk of the trial court in which you were convicted of 
 the infraction. It is a good idea to bring or mail an extra 
 copy to the clerk and ask 
 the clerk to stamp it to show 
 that the original has been filed. 
 There is no fee for filing the notice of appeal in an 
 infraction case. You can ask the clerk of that court if 
 there are any other requirements for filing your notice of 
 appeal. 
 After you file 
 your notice of appeal, the clerk will send a 
 copy of your notice to the office of the prosecuting 
 attorney (for example, the district attorney, county 
 counsel, city attorney, or state Attorney General) . 
 
 Filing the notice of appeal does NOT automat
 ically 
 postpone the deadline for paying your fine or 
 completing any other part of your sentence. 
 To 
 postpone your sentence, you must ask the trial court for 
 
 a ﬁstayﬂ of the judgment. 
 If you want a stay, you must 
 first ask the trial court for a stay. You ca
 n also apply to 
 the appellate division for a stay, but you must show 
 in your application to 
 the 
 appellate division that you first 
 asked the trial court 
 for 
 a stay and that the trial court

 unjustifiably denied your request. 
 Your fine or other 
 parts of yo
 ur punishment will not be 
 postponed unless 
 the trial court
 or appellate division grants a stay. If you 
 do not get a 
 stay and you do not pay your fi
 ne or satisfy 
 another part of your sentence by the date ordered by the 
 
 court, a warrant may be issued for you
 r arrest or a civil 
 
 collections process may be started against you, which 
 could result in a civil penalty being added to your fine. 
 
 
 Yes. When you file your notice of appeal, 
 you must tell 
 the trial court (1) whether you have agreed with the 
 respondent
 (ﬁstipulatedﬂ) that you do not need parts of 
 the normal record on appeal, and (2) 
 whether you want a 
 record of what was said in the trial court (this is called a 
 record of the ﬁoral proceedingsﬂ) sent to the appellate 
 division and, if so, what form of tha
 t record you want to 
 use. 
 Notice of Appeal and Record 
 on Appeal
 (Infraction) 
 (form CR
 -142) includes boxes you can check to tell the
 court whether and how you want to provide th
 is record. 
 
 
 You do not 
 have
 to send the appellate division a record 
 of wh
 at was said in the trial court. But if you want to 
 raise any issue in 
 your
 appeal that would require the 
 appellate division to consider what was said in the trial 
 court, the appellate division will need a record of these 
 oral proceedings. 
 For example, if y
 ou are claiming that 
 there was not substantial evidence supporting the 
 
 judgment, order, or other decision you are appealing, the 
 appellate division will need a record of the oral 
 proceedings. 
 Since the appellate division judges were 
 
 not 
 there
 for the proce
 edings in the trial court, an official 
 record of these proceedings must be prepared and sent to 
 the appellate 
 court
 for its review. 
 Depending on what form of the record you choose to 
 use, you will be responsible for paying to have the 
 official record of th
 e oral proceedings prepared 
 (unless 
 you are 
 indigent
 ) or for preparing an initial draft of the 
 record yourself. If you do not take care of these 
 responsibilities, a record of the oral proceedings in the 
 trial court will not be prepared and sent to the appe
 llate 
 division. If the appellat
 e division does not receive th
 e 
 record, it will not be able to consider what was said in 
 the trial court in deciding whether a legal error was made
 and it may dismiss your appeal
 . There are three ways a record of the or
 al proceedings in 
 a trial court can be prepared and provided to the 
 appellate division in an infraction case: 
 a. You can use a 
 statement on appeal
 . b. If the proceedings were officially electronically 
 recorded, the trial court can have a transcript 
 prepare
 d from the recording or, if the 
 court 
 has a 
 local rule permitting this and all the parties agree 
 
 (ﬁstipulate
 ﬂ) , you can use the 
 official 
 electronic 
 recording itself as the record, instead of a transcript. 
 c. If a court reporter was
 there
 during
 the trial c
 ourt
 proceedings
 , the reporter can prepare a record called 
 a ﬁreporter™s transcript. ﬂ
 Read below for more information about these options. 
 a. Statement
 on appeal
 Description: 
 A statement on appeal is a summary of 
 the trial court pr
 oceedings approved by the
 trial 
 court judge who conducted the trial court
 procee
 dings (the term ﬁjudgeﬂ includes 
 commissioner
 s and
 temporary judge
 s) . 
 When available: 
 If the trial court proceedings were 
 not recorded either by a court reporter or by official 
 electronic recording eq
 uipment or if you do not want 
 to use either of these forms of the record, you can 
 choose (ﬁelectﬂ) to use a statement on appeal as the 
 record of the oral proceedings in the trial court 
 (please note that it may take more of your time to 
 prepare a statement 
 on appeal than to use either a 
 reporter™s transcript or electronic recording, if they 
 are available)

 procedures for preparing 
 a statement. 
 You can get a copy of 
 this
 rule at any
 courthouse or county law library or online at 
 www. court

 ) Preparing 
 a propos
 ed statement: 
 If you choose to 
 use a statement on appeal, you must pr
 epare a 
 proposed statement. If you are not represented by a 
 lawyer, you must use 
 Proposed
 Statement on Appeal 
 (Infraction) 
 (form CR

 statement. You 
 can
 get form CR
 -143 at any 
 courthouse or county law library or online at 
 www. co
 urt

 . Servi
 ng and filing
 a proposed statement
 : You must 
 serve and file your proposed statement within 20 
 days after you file your notice of appeal. ﬁServe and 
 fileﬂ means that
 you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old 
 mail, deliver, 
 or electr
 onically send (ﬁserveﬂ) the proposed 
 statement to the prosecuting attorney and any 
 other party in the way required by law. If the 
 proposed statement is mailed or personally 
 delivered, it must be by someone who is not a 
 party to the case
 Šso not you
 . If the 
 prosecuting 
 attorney did not appear in your case, you do not 
 need to serve the prosecuting attorney. 
 Make a record that the proposed statement has 
 been served. This record is called a ﬁproof of 
 service. ﬂ 
 Proof of Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP
 -109) or 
 Proof of Electronic Service 
 (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP
 -109 E) 
 can be 
 used to make this record. 
 The proof of service 
 must show who served the proposed statement, 
 who was served with the proposed statement, 
 how the proposed statement was served (by 
 mail, in person
 , or electronically
 ) , and the date 
 the proposed statement was served. 
 File the original proposed statement and the 
 proof of service with the trial court. You should 
 make a copy of 
 the 
 proposed statement you are 
 planning to file for your own r
 ecords before you 
 file it with the court. It is a good idea to bring or 
 
 mail an extra copy of the proposed statement to 
 the clerk when you file your original and ask the 
 clerk to stamp this copy to show that the original 
 has been filed. 
 You can get

 . Review and modifications: 
 The prosecuting atto
 rney 
 and any other party 
 have
 10 days from the date you 
 serve your proposed statement to 
 serve and 
 file 
 proposed changes (called ﬁamendmentsﬂ) to this 
 statement. The trial judge then reviews both your 
 proposed statement and any proposed amendments 
 filed by
 the prosecuting attorney and any other party. 
 The judge will then make or order you to make 
 any 
 corrections or modifications to the proposed 
 statement that are needed to 
 make 
 sure that the 
 statement provides a complete and accurate 
 summary of the 
 relevant
 testimony and other 
 evidence
 . Completion and certification: 
 If the judge makes 
 or 
 orders you to make 
 any corrections or modifications 
 to the proposed statement, the corrected or modified 
 statement will be sent to you, the prosecuting 
 attorney, and any oth
 er party for your review. If you 
 disagree with anything in the judge™s statement, you 
 will have 10 days from the date the statement is sent 
 to you to serve and file objections to the statement. 
 The judge then reviews any objections, makes any 
 
 additional co
 rrections to the statement, and certifies 
 the statement as a complete and accurate summary 
 of the 
 relevant testimony and other evidence
 . Sending the statement to the appellate division: 
 Once the trial judge certifies the statement on 
 appeal, the trial cour
 t clerk will send the statement to
 the appellate division along with the clerk™s 
 
 transcript. 
 b. Official electronic recording or transcript 
 from official recording
 When available: 
 In some infraction cases, the trial 
 court proceedings are officially record
 ed on 
 approved electronic recording equipment. If your 
 case was officially recorded, you can ask to have a 
 transcript prepared for the appellate division from 
 the official electronic recording of the proceedings. 
 You should check with the trial court to se

 rules that establish procedures for deciding whether 
 a statement on appeal or a transcript of only some of 
 the oral proceedings will be a goo
 d enough record to 
 consider the issues you are raising on appeal. You 
 should check whether the court has such a local rule. 
 If 
 the court 
 has a local rule
 for the appellate division
 permitting this and all the parties agree (ﬁstipulateﬂ) , 
 a copy of the off
 icial electronic recording itself can 
 be used as the record of 
 these
 oral proceedings
 instead of preparing a transcript. 
 You should check 
 
 with the trial court to see if your case was officially 
 electronically recorded and check to make sure that 
 there is 
 a local
 rule permitting the use of the 
 recording itself before choosing this option. 
 If you 
 choose this option, you must attach a copy of 
 your 
 agreement 
 with the other parties 
 (called a 
 ﬁstipulationﬂ) to your notice regarding the oral 
 proceedings. 
 Cost: 
 Ordinarily, the appellant must pay for 
 preparing the transcript or making a copy of the 
 official electronic recording. 
 The court will send you 
 an estimate of the cost for this transcript or the copy 
 of the 
 electronic
 recording. If you still want this 
 transcr
 ipt or recording, you must deposit this amount 
 with the court. However, you can also choose to use 
 a statement on appeal instead, or take one of the 
 other actions listed in rule 8. 917. 
 If, however, you are indigent (you cannot afford to 
 pay the cost of th
 e transcript or electronic 
 recording) , you may be able to get a free transcript 
 
 or official electronic recording. You can complete 
 and file 
 Defendant™s Financial Statement on 
 Eligibility
 for Appointment of Counsel and 
 Reimbursement
 and Record on Appeal at 
 Public 
 Expense
 (form 
 CR 105) to show that you
 are 
 indigent. You can get form
 CR 105 at any 
 courthouse or county law library or online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/forms
 . The court will 
 review
 this 
 form to decide whether you are indigent. 
 If you are indigent, an of
 ficial electronic recording 
 of your case was made, and you show that you need 
 a transcript, the court must provide you with a free 
 transcript. Whether you need a transcript depends on 
 the issues you are raising on appeal. If the issues you 
 are raising on a
 ppeal include that there was not 
 substantial evidence supporting the judgment, order, 
 or other decision you are appealing or that there was 
 misconduct in your case that harmed you, that is 
 generally enough to show that you need a transcript. 
 If you ask 
 for a transcript, the court may ask you 
 what issues you are raising on appeal a
 nd may 
 
 decide that a statement on 
 appeal
 or a transcript of 
 only some of the oral proceedings will be a good 
 enough record to consider the issues you are raising. 
 If the court f
 inds that you are not indigent, it will 
 send you a notice and you will have a chance to use 
 a statement on appeal instead or take one of the other 
 actions listed in rule 8. 917. 
 Completion and delivery: 
 Once you deposit the 
 estimated cost of the transcript 
 or official electronic 
 recording with the clerk or show the court you are 
 
 indigent and need a transcript, the clerk will have the 
 transcript or copy of the recording prepared. 
 When
 the transcript is completed or the copy of the official 
 
 electronic recordin
 g is prepared, the clerk will send 
 the transcript or recording 
 to the appellate division 
 along with the clerk™s transcript. 
 c. Reporter™s transcript
 When available: 
 In some infraction cases, a court 
 reporter is
 there
 in the trial court and makes a record 
 of the oral proceedings. If a court reporter made a 
 record of you
 r case, you can ask to have the
 court 
 reporter prepare a transcript of those oral 
 proceedings, call
 ed a ﬁreporter™s transcript. ﬂ You 
 should check with the trial court to see if a court 
 reporte
 r made a record of your case before you 
 choose this option. 
 Some courts also have local rules 
 that establish procedures for deciding whether a 
 statement on appeal or a transcript of only some of 
 the oral 
 proceedings
 will be a good enough record to
 consider
 the issues you are raising on appeal. You 
 should check whether the court has such a local rule. 
 Cost: 
 Ordinarily, the appellant must pay for 
 preparing a reporter™s transcript. The court reporter 
 will provide the clerk of the trial court with an 
 estimate 
 of the cost of preparing the transcript, and 
 the clerk will notify you of this estimate. 
 If you want 
 the reporter to prepare a transcript, you must deposit 
 this 
 estimated
 amount or one of the substitutes 
 allowed under rule 8. 919 with the clerk within 10 
 
 days after the clerk sends you the estimate. 
 However, under rule 8. 919 you can decide to use a 
 
 different form 
 of the record or take other action 
 instead of proceeding with a reporter™s transcript

 If, 
 however
 , you are indigent (you cannot afford to 
 pay the 
 cost of the reporter™s transcript) , you may be 
 able to get a free transcript. You can complete and 
 file 
 Defendant™s Financial Statement on Eligibility 
 for Appointment of Counsel and Reimbursement
 and Record on Appeal at Public Expense
 (form 
 CR 105) to show
 that you are indigent. You can get form 
 CR 105 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov/forms
 . The court will 
 review this form to decide whether you are indigent. 
 If 
 the court finds that 
 you are indigent, a court 
 reporter mad
 e a record of your case
 , and you show 
 that you need a transcript, the court must provide 
 you with a free transcript. Whether you need a 
 transcript depends on the issues you are raising on 
 appeal. If the issues you are raising on appeal 
 include that there w
 as not substantial evidence 
 supporting the judgment, order, or other decision 
 you are appealing or that there was misconduct in 
 your case that harmed you, that is generally enough 
 to show that you need a transcript. If you ask for a 
 reporter™s transcript, 
 the court may ask you what 
 issues you are raising on appeal and may decide that 
 a statement on appeal or a 
 transcript
 of only some of 
 the oral proceedings will be a good enough record to 
 consider the issues you are raising. 
 If the court finds that you are 
 not indigent, it will 
 send you a notice and you will have a chance to pick 
 another form of the record or take other actions 
 listed in rule 8. 919. 
 Completion and delivery: 
 Once you deposit the 
 estimated cost of the transcript 
 or one of the 
 substitutes allow
 ed under rule 8. 919 
 or show the 
 court you
 are indigent and need a transcript, the 
 
 clerk will notify the reporter to prepare the 
 transcript. When the reporter completes the 
 transcript, the clerk will send both the reporter™s 
 transcript and clerk™s transcrip
 t to the appellate 
 division. 
 Yes. There are two other parts of the official record that 
 need to be sent to the appellate division: 
 Documents filed 
 in the
 trial court: 
 The trial court 
 clerk is responsible for preparing a record of the 
 written docum
 ents filed in your case, called a 
 ﬁclerk™s transcript, ﬂ and sending this to the appellate 
 
 division. 
 (The documents the clerk must include in 
 this transcript are listed in rule 8. 
 912
 of the 
 California Rules of Court. 
 You can get a copy of this 
 rule at any c
 ourthouse or county law library or 
 online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov
 /rules. 
 ) Exhibits submitted during trial: 
 Exhibits, such as 
 photographs or 
 maps
 , that were admitted in 
 evidence, refused, or lodged (temporarily placed 
 with the court) in the trial court are con
 sidered part 
 of the record on appeal. If you want the appellate 
 division to consider an exhibit, 
 however, 
 you must 
 ask the trial court clerk to send the original exhibit to 
 the appellate division within 10 days after the la
 st respondent™s
 brief is filed in
 the appellate division. 
 (See rule 8. 
 921 of the California Rules of Court for 
 more information about this procedure. 
 You can get 
 a copy of this rule at any courthouse or county law 
 library or online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov
 /rules. 
 ) Sometimes, the trial court r
 eturns an exhibit to a 
 party at the end of the trial. If the trial court returned 
 an exhibit 
 to you or another party and you or the 
 other party ask for the exhibit to be sent to the 
 
 appellate division, the party who has the exhibit
 must deliver that exhibi
 t to the 
 appellate
 division as 
 soon as possible. 
 
 As soon as the record of the oral proceeding is ready, the 
 clerk of the trial cour
 t will send it to the appellate
 division along with the clerk™s transcript. When the 
 appellate division receives this re
 cord, it will send you a 
 notice telling you when you must file your brief in the 
 appellate division. 
 A brief is a party™s written description of the facts in the 
 case, the law that applies, and the party™s argument about 
 the issues being appealed. If 
 you are represented by a 
 lawyer in your appeal, your lawyer will prepare your 
 brief. If you are not represented by a lawyer in your 
 appeal, you will have to prepare your brief yourself. You 
 Is there any other part of the record 
 that needs to be sent t
 o the appellate 
 division?

 927
 Œ8. 928
 of the California Rules of 
 Court, 
 which set out the requirements for preparing, 
 serving, and filing briefs in 
 infraction 
 appeals, including 
 requirements for the format and length of th
 ese briefs. 
 You can get the
 se rules at any courthouse or county law 
 library or online at 
 www. court
 s. ca. gov
 /rules. 
 Contents: 
 If you are the appellant (the 
 party who is
 appealing) , your brief, called the ﬁappellant™s opening 
 brief, ﬂ must clearly explain what you believe are the 
 legal errors made in the trial court. Your brief must refer 
 to the exact places in th
 e clerk™s transcript and the 
 statement on appeal
 (or other record of the oral 
 proceedings) that support your argument. Remember 
 tha
 t an appeal 
 is not a new trial. T
 he appellate division 
 will not consider new evidence, such as the testimony of 
 new witnesses
 or new exhibits, so do not include any 
 new evidence in your brief. 
 Serving and filing: 
 You must serve and file your brief in 
 the appellate division by the deadline the court set in the 
 notice it sent you, which is 
 usually
 30 days after the 
 record is filed
 in the appellate division. 
 If you do not 
 file your brief by the deadline set by the appellate 
 
 division, the court may dismiss your appeal. 
 ﬁServe and fileﬂ means that 
 you must: 
 Have somebody over 18 years old 
 mail, deliver, or 
 electronically send (ﬁserve
 ﬂ) the brief to the 
 respondent (the prosecuting agency) and any other 
 party in the way required by law. If the brief is 
 mailed or personally delivered, it must be by 
 someone who is not a party to the case
 Šso not you
 . Make a record that the brief has been s
 erved. This 
 record is called a ﬁ
 proof of service. ﬂ 
 Proof of Service 
 (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP
 -109) 
 or 
 Proof of 
 Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP
 -109 E) 
 can be used to make this record. T
 he proof of 
 service must show who served the brief
 , who was 
 served with the brief, 
 how 
 the brief was served (by 
 mail, 
 in person
 , or electronically
 ) , and the date the 
 brief was served. 
 File the original brief and the proof of service with 
 the appellate division. You should make a copy of 
 the brief you are
 planning to file for your own 
 records before you file it with the court. It is a good 
 
 idea to bring or mail an extra copy of the brief to the 
 clerk when you file your original and ask the clerk to 
 stamp this copy to show that the original has been 
 filed. 
 You can get 
 more 
 information about how to serve court 
 papers and proof of service 
 from 
 What Is Proof of 
 Service
 ? (form APP
 -109 INFO) and 
 at www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp
 -serving. htm
 . Within 
 30 days after you serve and file your brief, the 
 respondent (t
 he prosecuting agency) may, but is not 
 required to, respond by 
 serving and 
 filing a respondent™s 
 brief. If the respondent does not file a brief, the appellant 
 does not automatically win the appeal. The court will 
 decide the appeal on the record, the appell
 ant™s brief, and 
 any oral argument by the appellant. 
 If the respondent 
 serves and 
 files a brief
 , within 
 20 days 
 after the respondent™s brief was 
 served
 , you may, but are 
 not required to, 
 serve and 
 file another brief re
 plying to 
 the respondent™s brief
 . Thi
 s is called a ﬁreply brief. 
 ﬂ 
 
 Once all the briefs have been 
 served and 
 filed or the time 
 to 
 serve and 
 file them has passed, the court will notify 
 you of the date for oral argument in your case. 
 ﬁOral argumentﬂ is the part
 ies™ chance to explain thei
 r arguments to the appellate division judges in person. 
 You do not have to participate in oral argument
 , if you 
 do not want to; you can notify the appellate division that 
 you want to ﬁwaiveﬂ oral argument. 
 If all parties waive
 oral argument, the judges w
 ill decide your appeal based 
 on the briefs and the record that were submitted. 
 But if 
 one party waives oral argument and another party or 
 parties does not, the appellate division will hold oral 
 argument with the party or parties who did not waive it. 
 If 
 you do choose to participate in oral argument, you will 
 have up to 
 five
 minutes for your argument, unless the 
 court orders otherwise. Remember that the judges will 
 already have read the 
 briefs
 , so you do not need to read 
 your brief to the judges. It is mor
 e helpful to tell the 
 judges what you think is 
 most 
 important in your appeal

 or ask the judges if they have any questions you could 
 answer. 
 
 After oral argument 
 is held (or the date it was scheduled 
 passes if all the parties waive oral argument) 
 , the
 judges 
 of the appellate division will make a decision about your 
 appeal. 
 The appellate division has 90 days after 
 the date 
 scheduled for 
 oral argument to decide the appeal. 
 The 
 clerk of the court will mail you a notice of that decision. 
 
 If you decid
 e you do not want to continue with your 
 appeal, you must file a written document with the 
 appellate division notifying it that you are giving up (
 this 
 is called 
 ﬁabandoningﬂ) 
 your
 appeal. 
 You can use 
 Abandonment of Appeal (
 Infraction
 ) (form CR
 -145) to 
 file
 this notice in a
 n infraction
 case. You can get form 
 CR 145 at any courthouse or county law library or 
 online at

 . If you decide not to continue your appeal and it is 
 
 dismissed, you will (with only very rare exceptions) 
 permanently 
 give up the chance to raise any objections 
 to your conviction, sentence, or other mat
 ter that you 
 could have raised i
 n the appeal. If 
 your punishment was 
 stayed during the appeal, you may be required to start 
 complying with your p
 unishment
 immediately afte
 r your 
 appeal is dismissed.
