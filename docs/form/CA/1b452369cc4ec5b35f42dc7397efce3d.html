      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>When the parties have signed the agreement, you can 
present it to the court on the day of the hearing, but it is 
best if you can file it at least five days before that date, 
so the judge doesn't have to read your file multiple 
times.  
          Remember, the agreement is not an order until  
          it is signed by a judge. 
Some courts may limit the number of times the parties 
can agree to rescheduling a hearing. Check your local  
court rules before submitting your written agreement.
For information about how to write up your 
agreement, get it approved by the court, and filed in 
your case, see www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-agreeFL, 
speak with an attorney, or get help at your court’s self-
help center or the Family Law Facilitator.
If you and the other party do not have an agreement, 
the party who wants to reschedule the hearing must 
file papers, such as form FL-306 or form FL-307, to 
ask for a court order.

When to use Request to Reschedule  
Hearing (form FL-306)
You may use this form to ask to reschedule the hearing 
if the request for order or order to show cause you want 
to reschedule:
}

Does not include temporary emergency (ex parte) 
orders;
Was not served on the other parties; or 
Was served, but there is a good reason why the 
hearing should be changed to a new date. See         
6
for other requirements.

}}

Form FL-306 may also be used to reschedule a hearing 
to be able to meet with a child custody mediator or 
recommending counselor before the hearing. 

If this situation applies to you, ask your mediator or 
child custody recommending counselor for information.
Most courts have local procedures and forms for 
rescheduling a hearing but will accept form FL-306 or 
your agreement to reschedule the hearing.
Do not use form FL-306 to ask to change the date of a 
domestic violence restraining order hearing. For more 
information, read How to Ask for a New Hearing Date 
(form DV-115-INFO).

This form provides information about how to 
obtain a court order to reschedule a hearing in 
family court. This information sheet may not 
cover everything you need to know about 
rescheduling a hearing in your court. To learn 
more:

association, the State Bar of California at www.
calbar.ca.gov, or the Lawyer Referral Service at 
1-866-442-2529. For free and low-cost legal 
help (if you qualify), go to 

www.lawhelpca.org.

}

Contact the family law facilitator or self-help 
center for information and assistance, and 
referrals to local legal services providers. Go to 
www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-courtresources.htm.

Read California Rules of Court, rules 5.92 
through 5.95, for the procedures to reschedule a 
hearing.

Read rules 5.151 through 5.169 for the 
procedures to notify and serve the other party 
with a request to reschedule.

You can find these rules at any courthouse or  
county law library or online at www. 
courts.ca.gov/rules.

Written agreement (stipulation) to 
reschedule a hearing (form FL-308)
The judge in your family court case may order 
that the hearing date be rescheduled based on an 
agreement (stipulation) between the parties or 
their attorneys. 
You may use Agreement and Order to 
Reschedule Hearing (form FL-308) if you do not 
want to change temporary emergency orders. You 
may use a local form approved by the court, or 
write your own agreement.
You must follow your court’s local procedures to 
obtain the new hearing date from the court clerk. 
If the court has issued temporary    
 
emergency orders and those orders are in  
 
effect, the parties could further agree that those 
emergency orders will remain in effect until the 
end of the new hearing. A draft of a new 
temporary order with new end dates may have to  
be given to the court for the judge to sign with 
your agreement.

What if I need to reschedule the hearing 
for a good reason after the Request for 
Order or an order to show cause was 
served?
}

Complete a written request and a proposed order. 
You may use form FL-306 or FL-307, whichever 
form applies to your case, and must use Order on 
Request to Reschedule Hearing (form FL-309).

}

}

}

Follow your court’s local rules. 
To get a date for the court to consider your request 
to reschedule the hearing, find your court’s local 
rules online at www.courts.ca.gov/3027.htm and 
follow them.  
           Some courts will set a court hearing for the  
           judge to consider the request to reschedule. 
Other courts do not have a hearing, but will make 
an order based on the papers submitted to the court 
clerk. Before you complete any forms, it is 
important that you know how your court handles 
requests to reschedule a hearing.
Notify and serve the other party. 
The other party must be given notice of the request 
to reschedule the hearing and given a copy of the 
documents at the first reasonable opportunity 
before the court can consider the request. You may  
also include a blank Responsive Declaration to 
Request to Reschedule Hearing (form FL-310).

Submit the written request and order to the court.
You should complete and file with the court a 
written request to reschedule the hearing and a 
proposed order at least five court days before the 
hearing, unless you have a very good reason to 
submit them later. 

          When you submit the request and order,  
 
          you must also submit to the court proof that 
the party was notified and served with the 
documents. You may use Declaration Regarding 
Notice and Service of Request for Temporary 
Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders (form FL-303), a 
local court form, or a declaration that contains the 
same information as form FL-303.

4

When to use Request to Reschedule 
Hearing Involving Temporary 
Emergency (Ex Parte) Orders (form 
FL-307)
You may use form FL-307 to ask to reschedule 
the hearing if the request for order or order to 
show cause you want to reschedule: 
}

Includes temporary emergency (ex parte) orders.

Was not served on the other parties. 

Includes property restraint orders and you are the 
responding party. 

Was served but there is a good reason why the 
hearing should be changed to a new date. See         
6
for other requirements.

}}

}

5

Form FL-307 may also be used to reschedule a 
hearing to be able to meet with a child custody 
mediator or recommending counselor before the 
hearing. 

If this situation applies to you, ask your mediator 
or child custody recommending counselor for 
information. Most courts have local procedures 
and forms for recheduling, but will accept form 
FL-307 or your agreement to reschedule the 
hearing.
Do not use form FL-307 to ask to change the date 
of a domestic violence restraining order hearing. 
For more information, read How to Ask for a 
New Hearing Date (form DV-115-INFO).

What if I need to reschedule a  
hearing because the Request for Order 
or an order to show cause was not  
served on the other party?
You should complete and file with the court a 
written request to reschedule the hearing and a 
proposed order at least five court days before the 
hearing, unless you have a very good reason to  
submit them later.  
 
Another option is to appear in court on the date of 
the hearing and ask the court to reschedule the 
hearing. In this case, the party is not required to 
file a written request but must complete and 
submit a proposed order to the court. Order on  
Request to Reschedule Hearing (form FL-309) 
must be used for this purpose.

How to Reschedule a Hearing in Family Court

Follow your court’s procedure for obtaining the 
court order on your written request.
          If for some reason, you do not receive a  
          response to your request to reschedule from the  
court before the hearing, you should still attend the  
hearing, or the court may make a decision without you.   

Make an oral request on the date of the hearing.
Another option is to appear in court on the date of the 
hearing and ask the court to reschedule the hearing. In 
this case, the party is not required to file a written 
request but must complete and submit a proposed 
order to the court. Order on Request to Reschedule 
Hearing (form FL-309) must be used for this purpose.

7

What do I do after the court makes the  
order?
You must have the other party served with the order 
and other documents. For example:

An Order on Request to Reschedule Hearing (form FL-309); 
A filed Request for Order (form FL-300) or other 
moving papers;  
Any temporary emergency (ex parte) orders; and

Other papers that the court requires you to serve.

Prepare for your hearing. Find more information 
online at www.courts.ca.gov/1094.htm.
