 INFORMATION REGARDING RIGHTS AFTER
 ATTORNEY CLIENT FEE ARBITRATION
 (Alternative Dispute Resolution) 
 Form Approved for Optional Use
 Judicial Council of California
 ADR 105 [Rev. January 1, 2009] 
 ADR 105
 Business and Professions Code, § 6200 et seq. 
 INFORMATION REGARDING RIGHTS AFTER
 ATTORNEY CLIENT FEE ARBITRATION
 1. RIGHTS AFTER NONBINDING ARBITRATION
 A. What is a nonbinding attorney client fee arbitration award? 
 
 
 An award is nonbinding if (1) the parties did not agree in writing to be bound by the award after the dispute over 
 
 fees or costs arose; and (2) a party who did not willfully fail to appear at the arbitration hearing rejects the award 
 
 and requests a trial within 30 days after notice of a nonbinding award is mailed. 
 B. What are my rights if I am not satisfied with
 a nonbinding attorney client fee arbitration award? 
 
 If the arbitration award is nonbinding, you may have a right to
 a trial in court. If a request 
 for trial is granted in small 
 
 claims or superior court, the normal procedures for pretri
 al discovery, motions, court connected alternative dispute 
 
 resolution ("ADR") , and trial in that cour
 t will apply. If you want a trial in co
 urt, you should follow 
 the instructions in 
 this form to protect your rights. 
 C. What are my rights if I did not appear at the attorney client fee arbitration hearing? 
 
 If you did not appear at your fee arbitrat
 ion hearing in person or by
 counsel, you will have to
 prove to the court that 
 
 you had a good reason for not being there. If a court determines that your fa
 ilure to appear was 
 willful, you may not 
 
 be entitled to a trial after arbitration, and the othe
 r party may be able to enforce the arbitration award. 
 D. What must I do to
 get a trial in court? 
 
 You must file papers in the proper court within the required time limit. 
 E. How long do I have to act? 
 If you want a trial in court, 
 you must file your papers in
 court within 30 days after t
 he date that the arbitration a
 ward 
 is mailed to you. The da
 te the arbitration award was mailed is written at the end of the notice you received. 
 
 
 F. What papers must I file? In what court must I file them? 
 
 That depends. Has a lawsuit about the fees already been filed? 
 
 (1) YESŠlawsuit already filed
 
 If a lawsuit about the fees has already been filed, then you must file a request for a trial in the same court 
 
 where the lawsuit was filed, under the same case number of the lawsuit that is pending, after serving a copy on
 
 all parties who have appeared in the action as provided by law. If the lawsuit is in small claims court, you can
 
 use Judicial Council forms SC 100 and SC 101 to request a trial after a nonbinding attorney client fee 
 
 arbitration. If the lawsuit is in superior court, you can 
 use form ADR 104 to request a trial after a nonbinding 
 
 attorney client fee arbitration. 
 
 (2) NOŠlawsuit not yet filed
 
 If no lawsuit about the fees has been filed, you must file
 your own lawsuit in the proper court and request a trial
 
 in that court if you do not want the award to become binding. If the arbitration was held in California, you must 
 
 file the lawsuit and request for trial in the small claims court or the superior court in the county where the 
 
 arbitration was held, and then serve the complaint, summons, and request for trial on all named parties as 
 
 provided by law. 
 
 Ł If the amount in dispute is $5, 000 or less, yo
 u may file your lawsuit in small claims court. You can use 
 Judicial Council form
 SC 100 to file a lawsuit in small claims cour
 t and form SC 101 to request a trial in that
 action. 
 
 Ł If the amount in dispute is more
 than $5, 000, you must file a compla
 int in the superior
 court to begin your 
 lawsuit. You may be able to 
 use Judicial Council forms PLD C-001 through PLD C-001 (3) to file a new 
 superior court action, but you 
 may need a lawyer's help to prepare an appropriate complaint. You can use
 form ADR 104 to reject the arbi
 tration award and request a trial at the same time you file your complain
 t. G. What if I am satisfied with the award? 
 
 If you are satisfied with the nonbinding arbitration award, do nothing until the award becomes binding or the 
 other party requests a tr
 ial. The award will become binding if the ot
 her party does not file papers requesting a
 trial in co
 urt within the 30 day limit.

 ATTORNEY CLIENT FEE ARBITRATION
 (Alternative Dispute Resolution) 
 ADRŒ105 [Rev. January 1, 2009] 
 Information Regarding Rights After Attorney Client Fee Arbitration 
 (continued) 2. RIGHTS AFTER BINDING ARBITRATION
 A. What is a binding attorney client fee arbitration award? 
 
 An award is binding if either (1) the parties agreed in writing to be bound by the award after the dispute over fees o
 r costs arose; or (2) no party rejects the award and re
 quests a trial within 30 days after notice of a nonbinding award
 is mailed. (A trial after arbitration may not be gr
 anted, however, if the court dete
 rmines that the party requesting 
 the trial willfully failed to appear at the arbitration. ) 
 B. What are my rights if I am not satisfie
 d with a binding attorney client fee arbitration award? 
 
 A court has the power to vacate (cancel) an arbitration award, but only for the limited reasons stated in Code of Civil
 Procedure section 1286. 2. 
 The fact that a party disagrees with the arbitrator's award or thinks it is wrong is not a 
 basis for vacating the award. In 
 general, the grounds for vacating an award are: 
 
 (1) The award was obtained by corruption, fraud, or other unfair means. 
 
 (2) One or more of the arbitrators was corrupt. 
 
 (3) The misconduct of a neutral arbitrator substantially prejudiced a party's rights. 
 
 (4) The arbitrator exceeded his or her authority and the award cannot be fairly corrected. 
 
 (5) The arbitrator unfairly refused to postpone the hearing or to hear evidence useful to settling the dispute. 
 
 (6) An arbitrator failed to disclose wi
 thin the time for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator
 
 
 was then aware. 
 
 (7) An arbitrator should have disqualified himself or herself after a party made a demand to do so. 
 
 A court can also correct the following types of obvious mistakes in the award: 
 
 (1) The amount of the award was not calculated correctly, or a person, a thing, or property was not described
 
 
 correctly. 
 
 
 (2) The arbitrator exceeded his or her authority, 
 
 (3) The award is imperfect as a matter of form. 
 
 If you think you are entitled to correct or vacate the arbitration award, please follow the instructions below to protect
 
 your rights. 
 C. What must I do to vacate or correct a binding arbitration award? 
 
 You must file a petition to vacate 
 or correct the award in the proper court within the required time limit. 
 D. How long do I have to act? 
 If you want to correct or
 vacate the binding award, ordinarily you 
 must file your petition within 100 days 
 after the arbitration award was mailed to you. 
 The date the award was mailed 
 is at the end of the notice mailed with the award. If 
 you receive notice from a court that the other side has filed a petition to confirm
 the award, however, you no longer have 100 days 
 to file your petition. You then must respond by filing your
 petition to vacate 
 or correct the award within the time stated on the notice from the court. 
 E. What papers must I file
 ? In what court must I file them? 
 
 That depends. Has a lawsuit about the fees already been filed? 
 
 (1) 
 YESŠlawsuit already filed
 If a lawsuit about th
 e fees has already been filed, you must file your petition to vacate or correct the award w
 ith the same court wher
 e the lawsuit was filed, under the same case number as the lawsuit that is pending, after 
 serving a copy on all parties who have appeared in the action as provided by law. 
 
 
 (2) 
 NOŠlawsuit not yet filed 
 If no lawsuit about the fees has been filed, you must file your petition to correct or vacate the award in the proper
 court. If the arbitr
 ation was held in California, you must file the petition in the small claims court or the su
 perior 
 court in the county where the arbitratio
 n was held, and then serve the petition and a summons on all named 
 parties as provided by law. 
 
 Ł If the amount in dispute is $5, 000 or less, you can file your petition in the small claims court, using Judicial
 
 Council forms SC 100 and SC 101. 
 
 Ł If the amount in dispute is more than $5, 000, you must file your petition in the superior court. You can use 
 
 Judicial Council form ADR 103 to
 do this. (You do not need to file 
 a separate complaint with form ADR 103
 when you are petition
 ing to vacate or correct a binding arbitration award. )

 (Alternative Dispute Resolution) 
 ADRŒ105 [Rev. January 1, 2009] 
 Information Regarding Rights After Attorney Client Fee Arbitration 
 (continued) 
 
 F. What if I am satisfied with
 the binding arbitration award? 
 
 If the arbitration award indicates or says that you owe mone
 y and you do not intend to 
 petition to have the award
 
 corrected or vacated (canceled) , you should pay the amount that you owe. If you do not pay it, the other party has a
 
 right to get court orders allo
 wing him or her to collect the debt by taking and selling your property and by taking
 
 money from your paycheck and bank account. 
 If the arbitration award says that you are owed 
 money, you should write the other party a letter and demand 
 payment. 
 If you are not paid, you can seek to enforce the arbitration award. See item 3 below. 
 3. ENFORCEMENT OF BINDING 
 ATTORNEY CLIENT ARBITRATION AWARDS
 
 There are two procedures for enforcing binding attorney client fee arbitration awards. 
 A. 
 If you are the client, you have the righ
 t to ask the State Bar to 
 assist you in enforcing the arbitration award if the
 
 following is true: 
 (1) Your arbitration request was filed on or after January 1, 1994; and
 
 (2) (a) 100 days have passed from service of the award and the award is binding for either of the reasons stated
 in paragraph 2 A above, or
 
 (b) The award has become a final judgment after a tria
 l following arbitration or a
 fter a petition to vacate, correct, or confirm the award. 
 
 
 You can write or phone the State Bar and request the form 
 Request for Enforcement of an Award. 
 Contact: Mandatory Fee Arbitration, 180 Howard Street, 6 th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 1639
 
 (telephone: 415 538 2020) . 
 B. 
 Any party who is owed money also has the right to request court orders allowing him or her to take property or
 
 money from the other party's paycheck and bank accounts. To get those court orders based on an attorney client 
 
 fee arbitration award, however, you must first make 
 the arbitration award a judgment 
 of the court. To do this, you 
 must confirm the arbitration award in court. 
 
 (1) What must I do to confirm the arbitration award? 
 
 To confirm the arbitratio
 n award, you must file a petition to conf
 irm award with the proper court within the
 
 required time limit. 
 
 
 (2) How long do I have to act? 
 
 You must file your petition to confirm award 
 within four years after the date the arbitration award was mailed 
 
 to you. That date appear
 s at the end of the notice mailed with the award. 
 
 (3) What papers must I file? In 
 what court must I file them? 
 
 That depends. Has a lawsuit about the fees already been filed? 
 
 (a) 
 YESŠlawsuit already filed
 
 If a lawsuit about the fees has already 
 been filed, you will file your petition with the same court where the 
 lawsuit 
 was filed, under the same case nu
 mber as the lawsuit that is pending, after serving a copy of th
 e petition on all pa
 rties who have appeared in the action as provided by law. 
 
 (b) 
 NOŠlawsuit not yet filed
 
 If no lawsuit about the fees has been filed, then you mu
 st file your petition to
 confirm the award in the proper court. If the arbitration 
 was held in California, you must file
 the petition in the small claims 
 court or 
 the superior court in the coun
 ty where the arbitration was held, and then serve the petition and a summo
 ns 
 on all named parties as provided by law. 
 
 Ł If the amount in dispute is $5, 0
 00 or less, you can file your petiti
 on in the small claims court, using
 
 Judicial Council forms SC 100 and SC 101. 
 
 Ł If the amount in dispute is more
 than $5, 000, you must file your pe
 tition in the superior court. You can
 use Judicial Council form A
 DR 103 to do this. (You do not need to
 file a separate complaint with for
 m ADR 103 when
 you are petitioning to confirm a binding arbitration award. ) 
 
 
 (4) What are my rights after the arbitration award is confirmed? 
 
 When the arbitration award is confirmed, it becomes a judgment of the court. Once you have a judgment, you
 
 have a right to enforce the judgment. That me
 ans you can get court orders allowing you to collect your money. 
 
 Enforcing judgments 
 can be very technical and very complicated. The court has forms to use for this
 
 procedure. </div>
