 APP 009 INFO [Rev. January 1, 2021] INFORMATION SHEET FOR PROOF OF SERVICE (Court of Appeal) www. courts. ca. gov APP 009 INFOINFORMATION SHEET FOR PROOF OF SERVICE (COURT OF APPEAL) GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICE AND PROOF OF SERVICEThis information sheet provides instructions for completing Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009) or Proof of Electronic Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009 E) . This information sheet is not part of the proof of service and does not need to be copied, served, or filed. Rule 8. 25 of the California Rules of Court provides that before filing any document in the Court of Appeal, a party must serve one copy of the document on the attorney for each party separately represented, on each unrepresented party, and 
 on any other person or entity when required by statute or rule. Other rules specifically require that certain documents be 
 served, including the notice of appeal and notice designating the record on appeal in civil appeals and briefs in both civil 
 and criminal appeals. To "serve" a document on a person means to have that document delivered to the person. The general requirements concerning service are set out in Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010. 6Œ1013 a. Section 1010. 6 (a) (2) (A) (ii) addresses 
 electronic service in the trial courts, or superior courts, including their appellate divisions. Rule 8. 78 of the California Rules 
 of Court addresses electronic service in any case in the Court of Appeal. There are three main ways to serve documents: 
 (1) by mail, (2) by personal delivery, or (3) by electronic service. Regardless of what method of service is used, the Code 
 of Civil Procedure provides that a document in a court case can only be served by a person who is over 18 years of age. 
 Service by mail or personal delivery must be by someone who is not a party in the case; electronic service may be 
 performed directly by a party. Electronic service may be by (1) electronic transmission, transmitting a document to the 
 electronic service address of a person; or by (2) electronic notification, sending a message to the electronic service 
 address specifying the exact name of the document served and providing a hyperlink at which the served document may 
 be viewed and downloaded. If you are a party to the case and wish to serve documents by mail or personal delivery, you must therefore have someone else who is over 18 and who is not a party to the case serve any documents in your case. You will need to give 
 the person doing the serving (the server) the names and addresses of all those who must be served. You will also need to 
 give the server one copy of each document that needs to be served for each person or entity that is being served. If you are serving documents electronically, you can do this yourself or have another person over 18 do it for you. The person doing the serving (the server) will need the names and electronic service addresses of all those who must be 
 served, and the document to be served in a form that allows it to be electronically transmitted or made available by 
 hyperlink. Rule 8. 25 also requires the party filing a document in the court to attach to the document presented for filing a proof of service showing the required service, or if using an electronic filing service provider's automatic electronic document service, the party may have the electronic filing service provider generate a proof of service. Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009) or Proof of Electronic Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009 E) may be used to provide proof of service in any proceeding in the Court of Appeal. The server should follow the instructions below for completing the 
 Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009) or Proof of Electronic Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009 E) . If another person is serving the documents for youŠas is required if the document will be served by mail or personal deliveryŠtell the server to give you the original form when it is completed. You will need to attach this original proof of 
 service to the document you are filing. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SERVER (THE PERSON WHO IS SERVING THE DOCUMENTS) IF SERVING BY MAIL OR PERSONAL DELIVERY If you are serving a document for a party in a court case, it is your responsibility to prepare the proof of service. You can use Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP 009) to prepare this proof of service in any case in the Court of Appeal. The proof of service should be printed or typed.

 available at www. courts. ca. gov/forms. You can fill out most of the form before you serve the document, but you should sign and date the form only after you have finished serving the document.
