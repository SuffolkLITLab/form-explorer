If you need additional information, you may wish to consult an attorney. Form Approved for Optional Use 
 Judicial Council of California 
 EM 100 -INFO (Rev. September 1, 2018) 8Ł Ł EM 100 INFOŁ Ł WHAT IS EMANCIPATION? Emancipation is a legal procedure that frees children from the custody and control of their parents or guardians before 
 they reach the age of majority. (In California, this is age 18. ) 
 If you become emancipated, you will be able to do certain 
 things without your parent's consent, such as: consent to medical treatmentapply for a work permitenroll in school or college You will also give up your right to be supported by your parents. Even if you are emancipated: You must still attend school. You cannot get married without parental consent. You probably will remain under juvenile court jurisdiction, if you commit a crime. IF YOU HAVE A LEGAL GUARDIAN: All references in this pamphlet to parent or parents include legal guardians or guardians. HOW DO I BECOME EMANCIPATED? WHAT DO I DO IF THE JUDGE GRANTS MY PETITION FOR EMANCIPATION? If the judge grants your petition for emancipation after a hearing is held or without a hearing, you must take your 
 papers back to the clerk's office and file them. The clerk will 
 file the original declaration of emancipation, and give you 
 copies to keep as proof of emancipation. You may need to 
 show these copies to employers, landlords, doctors, school 
 officials, or others who would otherwise require parental 
 consent. If you want to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) about your emancipation, complete an Emancipated 
 Minor's Application to California Department of Motor 
 Vehicles (EM 140) form and take it to the DMV along with 
 a certified copy of the declaration of emancipation. IS EMANCIPATION PERMANENT? Emancipation is usually permanent. However, if there are statements on your petition that are not true, or if you 
 become unable to support yourself, the court may set aside 
 the declaration of emancipation. DO I HAVE CHOICES OTHER THAN 
 EMANCIPATION? Emancipation is only one of several alternatives available to you if you feel you cannot live with your parents. You may 
 want to consider other options such as: There are three ways you can become emancipated: You can get married (This requires parental consent and 
 permission from the court. ) 1. 72Ł Ł Ł Ł ŁŁ set a hearing on your petition to be conducted within 30 days thereafter. You can join the armed forces. (This requires parental 
 consent and acceptance by the service. ) You can obtain a declaration of emancipation from a judge. 3. The clerk will provide you with an endorsed filed copy of 
 the judge's order. This pamphlet tells you only about how to be declared 
 emancipated by a judge. If you want to be declared 
 emancipated by a judge, you must convince the judge that 
 you meet ALL of the following requirements: Declaration of emancipation without hearing If the judge finds that all notice and consent requirements have been met or waived, and that emancipation is not 
 contrary to your best interests, the judge may grant your 
 petition without a hearing. You are at least 14 years old. 1. You willingly want to live separate and apart from your 
 parents with the consent or acquiescence of your parents. 
 (Your parents do not object to you living apart from 
 them. ) 2. Setting a hearing and giving notice You can manage your own finances. 3. If the judge wants more information, a hearing will be held 
 within 30 days of the order prescribing notice and setting for 
 hearing. If the judge orders the matter set for hearing, the 
 clerk will notify the district attorney of the time and date of 
 the hearing. The judge may require that you give notice to 
 your parents and other people of the time and place of the 
 hearing. This is very important, because the judge may be 
 very strict about making sure that your parents were given 
 proper notice before granting an emancipation petition. 4. You have a source of income that does not come from 
 any illegal activity. Emancipation would not be contrary to your best interests; it is good for you. 5. HOW DO I GET DECLARED EMANCIPATED BY A JUDGE? Notice is provided by giving or mailing a copy of the 
 emancipation petition to each person the judge lists for you. 
 An adult, 18 years or older, must personally give or mail the 
 copies for you as soon as possible after the hearing date is 
 set, and complete a Proof of Service form to be filed with the clerk. You will need to complete certain forms and file them with 
 the court. You can get blank forms to fill out from the court 
 clerk's office. The forms you must fill out are: Petition for Declaration of Emancipation of Minor, 
 Order Prescribing Notice, Declaration of 
 Emancipation, and Order Denying Petition (EM 100) Emancipation of MinorŠIncome and Expense 
 Declaration (EM 115) 36Ł Ł Ł EM 100 INFO 1. why you want to be emancipated, and how you are supporting yourself. If you have children, tell how 
 you are supporting them. You could also include 
 letters from your employer and your landlord. Notice of Hearing (EM 109) Declaration of Emancipation of Minor After Hearing 
 (EM 130) If you do not know where your parents or guardians 
 live, you must tell the court when you last saw your 
 parents and what efforts you have made to find out 
 where your parents live. If you know where your parents live, but they refuse to sign the consent, you must get a hearing date from 
 the clerk, and give notice of the hearing to your 
 parents. If you know where your parents live, but you do not wish to notify one or both of them about this petition, 
 you must state ALL your reasons and request the 
 court to waive notification to your parents. Filing the petition and the other forms After you have completed the forms and all necessary attachments, and obtained your parents' signatures (if 
 possible) , take the forms and the attachments to the clerk's 
 office for filing. (When you pick up the blank forms, ask the 
 clerk how many copies of each form you will need to bring 
 with you. Be sure to keep a copy for yourself. ) When you 
 get to the court, tell the clerk that you are filing a petition 
 for emancipation and show the clerk your papers. The clerk 
 will keep at least one copy of your petition. The clerk will 
 either give or direct you to give the petition to the judge.

 fees waived, including an Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs form and an Order on Application of Court 
 Fees and Costs form. Unless waived, the petitioner shall 
 pay the filing fee as specified. The ability or inability to pay 
 the filing fee is not in and of itself evidence of the financial
