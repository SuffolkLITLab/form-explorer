Bankruptcy      Plaintiff's duty to give notice. If a defendant files a bankruptcy case during the receivership, plaintiff shall give
notice of the bankruptcy case to the court, to all parties, and to the receiver by the closing of the next business day after the 
day on which plaintiff receives notice of the bankruptcy filing.

Bankruptcy Receiver's duties. If the receiver receives notice that a bankruptcy has been filed and part of the bankruptcy
estate includes property that is the subject of this order, the receiver shall have the following duties:
a.

Turn over property if no relief from stay will besought. The receiver shall immediately contact the party who obtained the 
appointment of the receiver and determine whether that party intends to move in the bankruptcy court for an order for (1) relief 
from the automatic stay, and (2) relief from the receiver's obligation to turn over the property (11 U.S.C., § 543). If the party has 
no intention to make such a motion, the receiver shall immediately turn over the property to the appropriate entity either to the 
trustee in bankruptcy if one has been appointed or, if not, to the debtor in possession  and otherwise
comply with 11 United States Code section 543.

b. Remain in possession pending resolution. If the party who obtained the receivership intends to seek relief immediately from 
both the automatic stay and the receiver's obligation to turn over the property, the receiver may remain in possession and 
preserve the property pending the ruling on those motions (11 U.S.C., § 543(a)). The receiver's authority to preserve the
property shall be limited as follows:
(1)   The receiver may continue to collect rents and other income; 
(2)   The receiver may make only those disbursements necessary to preserve and protect the property;
(3)   The receiver shall not execute any new leases or other long-term contracts; and
(4)   The receiver shall do nothing that would effect a material change in the circumstances of the property.

c. 

Turn over property if no motion for relief is filed within 10 days after notice of the bankruptcy. If the party who obtained the
receivership fails to file a motion within 10 court days after his or her receipt of notice of the bankruptcy filing, the receiver 
shall immediately turn over the property to the appropriate entity –– either to the trustee in bankruptcy if one has been 
appointed or, if not, to the debtor in possession –– and otherwise comply with 11 United States Code section 543.

d.

Retain bankruptcy counsel. The receiver may petition the court to retain legal counsel to assist the receiver with issues
arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings that affect the receivership.

26.   Failure to turn over property. A receiver who fails to turn over the property in accordance with this order shall not be paid for 
        time and expenses after the date the receiver should have turned the property over.

27.

Other orders. (Additional orders may include authority of the receiver to do any other acts arising from special
are specified in Attachment 27
circumstances.)  Other orders

are as follows (specify):

28.    THE COURT ORDERS DEFENDANT to do the following:

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

a.   Turn over property. Immediately turn over possession of the property described in Attachment 1 to the receiver when the
appointment becomes effective, including any security deposits, prepaid rent, other rental or lease payments, and funds in
property management bank accounts for the property.

b.   Turn over related items. Immediately turn over to the receiver all keys, books, documents, and records relating to the property

and advise the receiver of federal taxpayer identification numbers relating to the property.

c.    Insurance.

(1)   Immediately advise the receiver about the nature and extent of insurance coverage on the property; 
(2)   Immediately name the receiver as an additional insured on each insurance policy on the property; and 
(3)   DO NOT cancel, reduce, or modify the insurance coverage.
