 CASE NUMBER: 
 DUTIES OF CONSERVATOR 
 and Acknowledgment of Receipt of 
 Handbook for Conservators
 DUTIES OF CONSERVATORWhen you are appointed by the court as a conservator, you become
 responsible to the court and assume certain duties and obligat
 ions. All of your actions as conservator are subject to review by the 
 court. You should clearly understand the information on this fo
 rm. You 
 will find additional information in the Judicial Council's 
 Handbook for Conservators, 
 receipt of which, in addition to a copy of this 
 form, you are required by law to acknowledge. 
 THE CONSERVATEE'S RIGHTS
 Conservatees do not lose all rights or all voice in important de
 cisions affecting their lives. All conservatees have the right 
 to be treated with understanding and respect, the right to have their wishes considered, and the right to be well cared for by their 
 
 conservators. Conservatees genera
 lly keep the right to (1) control their own wages or salary from employment, (2) make or 
 change a will, (3) marry, (4) receive person
 al mail, (5) be represented by a lawyer, 
 (6) ask a judge to change conservators, (7
 ) ask 
 a judge to end the conservatorship, (8) vote, unless a judge deci
 des they are not capable of exercising this right, (9) control
 personal spending money if a judge has authorized an allowance, 
 and (10) make their own medical decisions, unless a judge has 
 taken away that right and given it exclusively to their conservators.

 decide, within certain limits, where the conservatee will live; 
 and you must arrange for the cons
 ervatee™s health care, meals, clothing, personal care, housekeeping, transportation, and recreation. 
 A. You must determine the conservatee™s appr
 opriate level of care. Your determinatio
 n must be in writing, signed under penalty 
 of perjury, must be filed with the court within 60 days of 
 the date of the court™s order appointing you as conservator, and

 II. CONSULT WITH YOUR ATTORNEY
 Your attorney will advise you on your duties, the limits of your
 authority, the conservatee™s rights, your dealings with the co
 urt, 
 all other topics discussed in this form, 
 and many other matters. He or she will tell 
 you when you must ask for prior court appr
 oval 
 to take an action, when you may do so (and why it might be a 
 good idea) , and when prior court approval is not required. All leg
 al 
 questions should be discussed with your attorney, not the c
 ourt staff, which is not permitted to give legal advice. 
 Your attorney will also help prepare your
 inventories, accountings, petitions, and all ot
 her documents to be filed with the cou

 tions are given proper notice. He or she will also advise you a
 bout legal limits on estate investments, leases 
 and sales of estate assets, 
 loans, lawsuits against others involving the conservatee
 or his or her property, and many other matters, and can prepare or revi
 ew documents needed in these matters. You should communicate 
 frequently and cooperate fully with your attorney at all times. 
 When in doubt, contact your attorney. 
 Other questions may be answered by calling on local co
 mmunity resources. (To find 
 these resources, see the 
 Handbook for 
 Conservators
 and the local supplement distributed by the court. )

 III. 
 DECIDE WHERE THE CONSERVATEE WILL LIVE
 You may not place the conservatee involuntarily in a mental health treatment facility unless he or she has been 
 determined to be gravely disabled as the result of a mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism, you have been 
 
 appointed as conservator under the Lanterman Petris Short Act 
 (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5350 et seq. ) , and then only if the 
 court has authorized the placement. If the court has author
 ized you to place the conservatee in a secured perimeter 
 residential care facility or a locked and secured nursing fac
 ility because he or she suffers from dementia, you must be 
 sure that the placement is the least restrictive 
 placement appropriate to 
 the conservatee™s needs. 
 B. A. If the conservatee is a limited conservatee who is developmen
 tally disabled, special rules may apply to the determination 
 of his or her level of care and residential placement. See item 
 VI below. 4. DUTIES OF CONSERVATOR 
 and Acknowledgment
 of Receipt of 
 Handbook for Conservators
 (ProbateŠGuardianships and Conservatorships) 
 1. You must decide where the conservatee will live. You may 
 choose a residence in California without prior approval of 
 the court, but you must choose the least restrictive appropria
 te residence that is available and necessary to meet the 
 conservatee™s needs and that is in his or her best interests. 
 2. You must file a written notice of any change of the conservatee™
 s residence with the court within 30 days of the move, and 
 you must mail copies of the notice to the conservatee™s attorn
 ey, the conservatee™s spouse or registered domestic partner, 
 and the conservatee™s relatives who were
 mailed copies of the petition for your a
 ppointment as conservator, unless the 
 court excuses you from the mailing to prevent harm to the cons
 ervatee. (There is a court form you must use for this notice 
 and another form you may use to prove that you have mailed it. The forms are the 
 Post Move Notice of Change of 
 Residence of Conservatee or Ward 
 (form GC 080) and the 
 Attachment to Post Move Notice, etc. 
 (form GC 080 (MA) . 
 These forms refer to a ﬁpost move no
 ticeﬂ because the notice may be filed and mailed after the date of the move. ) 
 The law presumes that the conservatee™s 
 personal residence (see item IIIA
 ) is the conservatee™s least restrictive 
 appropriate residence. There must be a re
 ason supported by sufficient evidence to justify a change of residence from the 
 conservatee™s personal residence (including a move from a care
 facility or other temporary placement to a residence that 
 is not the conservatee™s personal residence) . 
 3. 4. If you want to move the conservatee from his or her 
 personal residence, 
 in addition to the post move notice described in 
 item 2, you must mail a notice of your intent to change the 
 conservatee™s residence to the 
 conservatee, the conservatee™s 
 attorney, if any, and to each other person or entity entitled 
 to notice of the hearing on the petition for your appointment 
 as conservator; and then you must file with the court proo
 f that the notice was mailed. Un
 less there is an emergency 
 requiring a shorter period of notice, this
 notice must be mailed at least 15 days before the date of the proposed move. 
 (There is a court form you must use for this notice and a
 nother form you may use to prove that you have mailed it. The 
 forms are the 
 Pre Move Notice of Proposed Change of Pe
 rsonal Residence of Conservatee or Ward
 (form GC 079) and 
 the Attachment to Pre Move Notice, etc. 
 (form GC 079 (MA) . These forms refer to a ﬁpre move noticeﬂ because the 
 notice must be mailed before the move. ) 
 5. If you want to establish the conservatee™s residence outside 
 California, you must petition the court for permission before 
 the move. Notice of the court hearing on this petition, togeth
 er with a copy of the petition, must be mailed to the 
 conservatee and the other persons and entities that were 
 entitled to notice of the hearing on the petition for your 
 appointment as conservator. There is
 a court form for this petition, the 
 Petition to Fix Residence Outside the State of 
 California
 (form GC 085) . Notice of the hearing and proof of
 its mailing is given on another court form, the 
 Notice of HearingŠGuardianship or Conservatorship 
 (form GC 020) . 
 6. A plan to return the conservatee to his or her 
 personal residence or an explanation of the limitations or restrictions on a 
 return of the conservatee to that resi
 dence in the foreseeable future if the 
 conservatee was not living there when the 
 petition for appointment of a conservator was filed. 
 2. A reevaluation after a material (important) change in circum
 stances affecting the conservatee™s needs for placement and 
 care after your initial determination. 
 3. An evaluation of the level of care existing when the petition for your appointment as a conservator was filed and the 
 measures that would be necessary to 
 keep the conservatee in his or her 
 personal residence. 
 1. (Note: The conservatee™s 
 personal residence is the residence the conservatee understood or believed to be his or her 
 permanent residence on (1) the date the petition for appointment of
 a conservator was filed in this matter, or (2) on the last 
 earlier date the conservatee could form or communicate an unde
 rstanding or belief about a permanent residence, whether or 
 not he or she was living there when the appointment petitio
 n was filed. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7. 1063 (b) . )

 Interest bearing accounts
 and other investments
 Except for a checking account intended for payment of ordi
 nary expenses, estate bank accounts must earn interest. 
 You may deposit estate funds in one or more insured accounts
 in financial institutions, but you should not put more than 
 the FDIC insurance limit, currently $250, 000, 
 in any single institution. You have authority to make some investments 
 without court approval. Other investments may be made only 
 after court approval has been obtained. Consult with an

 Keep estate money and property separate fr
 om your or anyone else™s money or property
 You must keep the money and property of the conservatee™s 
 estate separate from your money or property or from the 
 money or property of any othe
 r person. Never deposit estate
 funds in your pers
 onal bank account or otherwise mix them 
 with your or anyone else™s funds, even for brief periods. Title
 to individual stocks, bonds, or other securities; securities 
 broker accounts; mutual f
 unds; and accounts with banks and other financial in
 stitutions must show that these assets are 
 property of the conservatorship estate 
 and not your or anyone else™s property. 
 2. MANAGING THE ESTATE
 Prudent management for the benefit of
 the conservatee; prudent investments
 You must manage the estate™s property or
 assets and income for the benefit of 
 the conservatee and with the care of a 
 prudent person dealing with someone else™s property. You mu
 st not make unreasonably risky investments of money or 
 property of the estate. 
 A. 1. CONSERVATOR OF THE ESTATE
 The conservatee™s property or assets and income are known as
 the conservatee™s ﬁestate. ﬂ If the court appoints you as 
 conservator of the estate, you will manage th
 e conservatee's finances, protect the cons
 ervatee™s income and property or assets, 
 make an inventory of the conservatee™s prope
 rty or assets, make sure the conservatee™
 s bills are paid, invest the conservatee™s
 money, see that the conservatee receives all the income and benef
 its to which he or she is entitled, ensure that the conservate
 e™s tax returns are filed on time and all taxes paid, keep accurate fi
 nancial records, and regularly report the conservatee™s finan
 cial condition to the court. 
 (Note: Property or assets and income in a trust 
 for the conservatee's support and maintenance are usually 
 not considered as part of the conservatee™s estate, particular
 ly if the trust was created and funded before the appointment of 
 a conservator. Unless the conserva
 tee™s spouse or registered domestic
 partner consents to its inclusion in the conservatee™s esta
 te, the community property of the conservatee and his or her s
 pouse or registered domestic partner under the management and 
 control of the spouse or partner is also not part of the conservatee™s estate. ) 
 IV. You must ask and receive the court™s perm
 ission, after full disclosure
 of all relevant facts, 
 before you may pay from the 
 conservatee™s estate fees to yourself for your services as cons
 ervator and to your attorney for his or her services to you; 
 borrow money for or loan money from the conservatee's estate (t
 o yourself or anyone else) ; or make gifts of estate assets 
 or property. 
 Prior court approval required for 
 fees, borrowing, loans, and gifts
 3. 4. GC 348
 WORK WITH THE PERSON (S) RESPONSIBLE FO
 R MANAGING THE CONSERVATEE'S PROPERTY
 If other persons are handling the conservatee™s property, such as
 his or her estate conservator, the conservatee™s spouse or 
 registered domestic partner in possession 
 of the couple™s marital or partnership property, or the trustee of a trust created fo
 r the management of the conservatee™s property and for his or 
 her support, you must work together to be sure that the 
 conservatee can afford the care you arrange. Purchases you make
 for the conservatee must be approved by the person (s) 
 responsible for managing the conservatee™s assets or you may 
 not be reimbursed or your 
 reimbursement may be delayed. 
 D. PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE FOR THE CONSERVATEE
 You are responsible for making sure that the conservatee™s hea
 lth care needs are met. But there are special rules you must 
 follow to meet these needs. Two of the most important rules are as follows: 
 C. Unless the court has given you exclusive authority to consen
 t to the conservate
 e™s medical treatment because the court 
 has determined that the conservatee has lost the capacity to
 make sound medical decisions
 , your consent or refusal to 
 consent to such treatment is not sufficient if the conservat
 ee disagrees (except in certain emergency situations) . If you do 
 have exclusive medical consent authority, you should be sure 
 that all medical treatment and medications are appropriate. 
 1. 2. If the conservatee has dementia and has lost the capacity to give an informed consent to the administration of 
 medications for its treatment and care, you must be given specific authority by the court to consent to the administration 
 
 of these medications. If you do have this authority, you 
 should be sure that the medications are appropriate.

 You should undertake, as soon as possible after your appointm
 ent and qualification as conservator, to locate and take 
 reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the conservatee's 
 estate planning documents, includi
 ng wills and codicils, living 
 trusts, powers of attorney for health care and fi
 nances, life insurance policies, and pension records. 
 Locate the conservatee's estate planning documents
 9. A. 12. Guard against inappropriate disclosure of
 the conservatee™s financial information
 11. Subject to your duty of full disclosure 
 to the court and persons entitled under the law to receive it, you must closely 
 guard against unnecessary or inappropriate disclo
 sure of the conservatee'
 s financial information. 
 10. Preserve property mentioned in the co
 nservatee's estate planning documents
 Make reasonable efforts to identify, 
 locate, and preserve property mentioned 
 in the conservatee™s estate planning 
 documents. 13. Conservatee's tangible
 personal property
 If you plan to dispose of any of the conservatee™s tangible 
 personal property, inform the conservatee™s family members 
 in advance and give them an opportunity to acquire the property, with approval or confirmation of the court. 
 Factors to consider when deciding whether to
 dispose of any of the conservatee™s property
 In deciding whether it is in the best interest of the conserva
 tee to dispose of property of his or her estate, consider the 
 following factors, among others, as appropriate in the circumstances: 
 (A) The likely benefit or improvement of the conservat
 ee™s life that disposing of the property would bring; 
 (B) The likelihood that the conservatee would need or benefit from the property in the future; 
 The previously expressed or current desires of the 
 conservatee concerning the property, unless accommodating 
 those desires would violate your fiduciary duty to the conser
 vatee or impose an unreasonab
 le expense on the estate; 
 The provisions of the conservatee™s estate plan concerning the property; 
 The tax consequences of disposing of the property; 
 The impact of disposition on the conser
 vatee™s eligibility for public benefits; 
 The condition of the entire estate; 
 The likelihood that the property will deteriorate or be subject to waste if kept in the estate; and
 The benefit versus the cost or liability of maintaining the property in the estate. 
 (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) (H) (I) You should evaluate the conservatee™s ability to manage cas
 h or other assets and take appropriate action, including 
 asking for prior court approval when necessary
 or appropriate, to enable the conserva
 tee to do so to the level of his or 
 her ability. 
 Evaluate the conservatee™s ability 
 to manage cash and other assets
 8. 6. Defend against actions or claims against the conservatee or hi
 s or her estate when it is in
 the best interest of the 
 conservatee or the estate to do so. The court may require you 
 to be represented by a lawyer for your defense of a lawsuit 
 against the conservatee™s estate. You may request court appr
 oval or instructions concerning the defense or compromise 
 of such a lawsuit. 
 Defend against claims against the conservatee™s estate
 IV. 5. Pursue claims against others on behalf of the conservatee™s esta
 te when it is in the best inte
 rests of the conservatee or his 
 or her estate to do so. The cour
 t may require you to be represen
 ted by a lawyer to proceed with
 litigation on 
 behalf of the 
 conservatee™s estate. Consider requesting prior court aut
 hority to pursue or compromise large or complex claims, 
 particularly those that might require litigation and the assistance of legal counsel and those that might result in an award 
 
 of attorney fees for the other party ag
 ainst the conservatee™s estate if you ar
 e unsuccessful. You may sign a contingent 
 fee agreement with legal counsel on behalf 
 of the conservatee™s estate if such ag
 reements are customary for the type of 
 case involved, but the court must approve the agreement before it is enforceable. You may ask for court approval of a 
 
 contingent fee agreement before signing it and be
 fore legal counsel perfor
 ms any services under it. 
 Claims against others on behalf of the conservatee
 You must learn about and collect all public and insura
 nce benefits for which the conservatee is eligible.

 A. Other limitations or restrictions
 There are many limitations or restrictions on your authority to
 deal with estate assets not mentioned here. If you do not 
 obtain the court™s permission when it is required before ta
 king an action, you may be removed as conservator or you 
 may be required to reimburse the estate from your own personal funds, or both. 
 16. IV. File and mail copies of the inventory 
 and appraisal and notice of how to object
 Within 90 days after your appointment as conservator, unle
 ss the court gives you more time, you must file with the court 
 your inventory containing the appraisals of estate property, si
 gned by you and, if the probate referee has appraised assets, 
 by the referee. You must also mail copies of the completed in
 ventory and appraisal to the conservatee, the conservatee™s 
 attorney, if any, and the conservatee™s spouse or registered 
 domestic partner, parents, and 
 children, and must give them 
 written notice of how to file an objection to the inventory and a
 ppraisal. There is a court form 
 that must be used for this 
 notice, the Notice of Filing of Inventory and Appraisal and How to Object to the Inventory or the Appraised Value of 
 Property (form GC 042) . 
 3. Determine the value of the estate™s property
 You must arrange to have a 
 probate referee 
 appointed by the court appraise, or determine the fair market value of, the 
 noncash property of the estate shown in Attachment 2 of your

 d cash equivalent items of property listed in 
 Attachment 1, such as bank accounts. 
 2. INVENTORY OF ESTATE PROPERTY
 You must identify, locate, take possession of, and protect all th
 e conservatee™s property, assets, and income that will be or 
 become part of the conservatorship estate
 . You must change the record title or ownership of most property and assets of 
 the estate to reflect the conservatorship. You must record a copy of your 
 Letters of Conservatorship (form GC 350) with 
 the county recorder in each county where the conservatee owns real property. You must then prepare an inventory, or a 
 
 list, of all of the real and personal proper
 ty of the estate. There are court forms that must be used for the inventory. These 
 consist of a two page cover sheet, 
 Inventory and Appraisal
 (form DE 160/GC 040) and one or more pages to be attached 
 to the cover sheet containing the list of property, 
 Inventory and Appraisal Attachment 
 (form DE 161/GC 041) . The 
 property is separated into two categories, cash and cash equi
 valent items, listed on Attachment 1; and all other types of 
 real and personal property, listed on Attachment 2. 
 Locate and take possession of the esta
 te's property and p
 repare an inventory
 1. B. RECORD KEEPING AND ACCOUNTING
 Keep records and prepare accountings
 You must keep complete and accurate records of each financia
 l transaction affecting the estate, including all receipts of 
 income, changes in assets or property held in the esta
 te, and expenditures. The checkbook for the conservatorship 
 checking account is your indispensable tool for keeping records of income and expenditures. You should also save 
 
 original bills or invoices paid, record
 s of property sale transactions, recei
 pts for money spent, and bank or other 
 institutions™ statements showing income received and money 
 spent. You must prepare periodic accountings of all money 
 and property you have received, what you have spent, the date
 of each transaction, and its purpose. Your accountings must 
 describe in detail what you have left after you pay the es
 tate™s expenses. There are court forms you may, or in some 
 situations must, use for your accountings. You will have to file 
 original statements from banks and other institutions with 
 your accountings. 
 C. 1. 15. You should communicate as necessary and appropriate with
 the conservator of the conservatee™s person, if any, 
 and with the trustee of any trust of which the conservatee is a beneficiary. 
 Communicate with conservator

 DUTIES OF CONSERVATOR and Acknowledgment of Receipt of 
 Handbook for Conservators
 (ProbateŠGuardianships and Conservatorships) 
 IV. DUTY TO DISCLOSE CHANGES IN MARITAL OR DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP STATUS
 If you are the spouse of the conservatee, you must disclose to
 the court, and give notice to interested persons under the Proba
 te Code, of the filing of any action or proceeding against the co
 nservatee for (1) legal separation, (2) dissolution of marriage, 
 or (3) 
 adjudication of nullity of the marriage. If you are or were the re
 gistered domestic partner of the conservatee, you must disclo
 se to the court any termination of 
 the domestic partnership. The disclosure must be 
 made within 10 days of 
 the initial filing of t
 he action or proceeding or termination of the partnership by fili
 ng a notice with the court. If you are not the spouse or register
 ed domestic partner or former partner of the conservatee and one 
 of these events occurs, the conservatee™s spouse or former 
 registered domestic partner must
 disclose the event to you within the same 10 day period. 
 V. DUTY TO HELP LIMITED CON
 SERVATEE DEVELOP SELF RELIANCE
 You must secure treatment, services, 
 and opportunities that will assist the 
 limited conservatee to develop maximum 
 self reliance and independence. This assi
 stance may include training, education, medical and psychological services, social 
 opportunities, vocational opportunities, and other appropriate help. 
 B. DETERMINATION OF LEVEL OF CARE FOR CERTAIN LIMITED CONSERVATEES
 C. The level of care determination described in item 
 IIIA
 does not apply to a limited conservatee who receives services from a 
 regional center for the developmentally disabled and for whom 
 the Director of Developmental 
 Services or the regional center 
 is acting as conservator. Determination of the services provi
 ded for and residential placement of these limited conservatees 
 are to be identified, delivered, and evalua
 ted consistent with the individual progra
 m plan process described in Welfare and 
 Institutions Code sections 4640Œ4659. 
 (See Prob. Code, § 2352. 5 (e) . ) 
 AUTHORITY SPECIFIED IN YOUR 
 LETTERS OF CONSERVATORSHIP 
 AND APPOINTMENT ORDER
 If the court appoints you as 
 limited conservator, you will have authority to take care of 
 only 
 those aspects of the conservatee's 
 life and financial affairs specified in your 
 Letters of Conservatorship 
 and the court's order appointing you. The conservatee 
 retains all other legal and civil rights. Although most of the 
 information provided in this form also applies to limited 
 conservatorships (especially the duties of the conservator of 
 the person) , you should clarify with your attorney exactly which 
 information applies in your case. 
 A. LIMITED CONSERVATOR (for the developmentally disabled only) 
 VI. TEMPORARY CONSERVATORIf the court appoints you as temporary conservator, you will
 generally have the same duties and authority as general 
 conservators, 
 except
 the conservatorship will end on the date specified in your 
 Letters of Temporary Conservatorship. 
 Most of 
 the information in this form also applies to temporary conser
 vatorships, but you must consult your attorney about which duties 
 you will 
 not perform because of the short duratio
 n of the temporary cons
 ervatorship appointment. A temporary conservator 
 should avoid making long term decisions or 
 changes that could safely wait until a 
 general conservator is appointed. As 
 temporary conservator, you may not move a conservatee from his 
 or her home, unless there is an emergency, or sell or give 
 away the conservatee's home or any ot
 her assets without prior court approval. 
 VII. 
 Sign the Acknowledgment of Receipt on page 7. Court review of your accountings and records
 You must file with the court a report 
 with each of your accoun
 tings that shows the current circumstances of the 
 conservatee and the estate, along with a petition requesting th
 at the court review and appr
 ove the accounting. Your first 
 accounting is due one year after your appointment, and later acco
 untings must be filed at least every two years after that. 
 The court may order you to file more fr
 equent accountings. You must
 save your receipts and other original records 
 because the court may ask to review them. If you do not file your accountings as 
 required, the court will order you to do 
 so. You may be removed as conservator if you fail to prope
 rly prepare and file your accountings or comply with the 
 court™s orders.

 JUDICIAL COUNCIL FORMS
 VIII. 
 This form identifies a number of Judicial
 Council forms used for court filings in c
 onservatorship proceedings. This form, the 
 petition for your appointment as conservator, 
 and the order that appoints you as conser
 vator are examples of Judicial Council 
 forms. Judicial Council forms are either mandatory or optional. 
 If a mandatory form applies to 
 a situation or proposed action, 
 it must be used. Optional forms may be used, at the option of the 
 person preparing and filing the form or, in some situations, at 
 the option of the court. Each form is identified on the bottom le
 ft side of its first page as optional or mandatory. Judicial 
 Council forms are not available for every situation where a docum
 ent may or must be filed with the court, but the forms 
 address the most common and important matters
 that occur during a conservatorship. The 
 Handbook for Conservators
 has additional information about Judicial Council conservatorship forms. 
 The forms are posted on the website in both unfillable and fillable 
 versions, as PDF files. The unfillable versions are designe
 d to be completed by typewriter or, in some 
 cases, by hand. Fillable forms may be filled 
 out online, then printed out ready for 
 signing and filing with the court, and they may also be saved to 
 your computer and completed in more than one sitting. Go to 
 the ﬁForms and Informationﬂ page at the Web site™s Se
 lf Help Center for more information on accessing the forms. 
 Your attorney will select and prepare the appropriate Judicial 
 Council forms. However, if you do not have an attorney, you can 
 prepare them yourself. All Judicial Council forms are 
 posted on the California courts™ public website, 
 www. courts. ca. gov. 
 Select ﬁFormsﬂ at the top of the site's home page, then select 
 the form group in the drop down menu in the middle of the page. 
 All conservatorship forms are collected in
 the ProbateŠGuardianships and Conservato
 rships form group. They are designated 
 with the prefix ﬁGC, ﬂ followed by a three digit number. Forms 
 shown in the drop down list with an asterisk are mandatory 
 forms. </div>
