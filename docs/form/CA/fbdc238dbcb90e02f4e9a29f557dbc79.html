 What Is ﬁProof of Serviceﬂ in a Guardianship? (ProbateŠGuardianships and Conservatorships) 
 GC 510. What is ﬁProof of Serviceﬂ in a Guardianship? What is ﬁserviceﬂ? When you are involved in a court 
 case, you are responsible for delivery 
 (ﬁserviceﬂ) of copies of important papers 
 you file with the court to other people 
 involved in the case. De
 pending on the circumstances, these papers must be 
 served by personal delivery (called 
 "personal service"
 ) , or may be served by mail (called ﬁ
 service by mailﬂ
 ) . Judicial Council of California 
 www. courtinfo. ca. gov
 
 Approved July 1, 2007 Optional Form
 Probate Code, § 1511
 Who can serve? Ask someone you know, a registered process
 server, or a representative of the county 
 sheriff's civil division, to personally serve copies of the forms to the 
 persons named above. The forms 
 cannot be sent to those persons by mail. The server must be at least 18 years of age. 
 Don't serve these by mail! 
 SomeoneŠnot you or anyone else who signed the 
 Petition
 Šmust personally serve (hand deliver) copies of the 
 Notice of Hearing 
 and the Petition
 to the persons named above. Service lets these persons know: 
 Who must be personally served? The child who needs a guardian, but only if
 he or she is at least 12 years old. 
 The child's parents. 
 Any person who has legal custody of the child or is serving as court appointed guardian 
 of the child's property (the child™s ﬁestateﬂ
 ) . Any person nominated as guardian of the child by one or both of the child's parents 
 
 (if your petition does not ask the court to appoint that pe
 rson as guardian) . Any person nominated as guardi
 an of the estate of the child
 for property received by the 
 child from the person making the nomination. 
 (You may use this form as a checklist
 . Check all that apply to your case. ) 
 How do I arrange for personal service? That you are asking the cour
 t to appoint a guardian for the child named in the 
 Petition
 . The person you want the court to appoint as 
 guardian (either yourself or someone else) . 
 The date and time when, and the place wher
 e, the court will hear your request. 
 A registered process server is a business you pay to deliv
 er court forms. Look in 
 a telephone directory under ﬁProcess Serving. ﬂWhat papers must be served at the beginning of a guardianship case? If you file a petition for appointment of
 a guardian for a child, you are a 
 petitioner. At the beginning of the case the 
 petitioner must arrange for pe
 rsonal service of copies of the petition and other papers on 
 certain people, must see that these papers are served on certain othe
 r people either by mail or by personal 
 service (at the petitioner's choice) , and 
 then must show the court that this has been done (called ﬁ
 proving service, ﬂ or ﬁproof of serviceﬂ) . A filled in copy of the petition for appointment of a guardian (the 
 ﬁPetitionﬂ
 ) . In a guardianship of the person, this may be either 
 Form GC 210 (P) , Petition for Appointment of a Guardian of the 
 Person or Form GC 210, Petition for Appointment of Guardian of Minor
 . Copies of all papers attached to the 
 Petition
 must also be served with it. 
 A filled in copy of Form
 GC 020, Notice of HearingŠGuardianship or Conservatorship
 , (the ﬁNotice of Hearingﬂ
 ) showing the date, time, and place of the hearing on the 
 Petition
 , including (unsigned) copies of all attachments 
 showing proof of service. 
 The sheriff's civil division often has an office at th
 e courthouse. You will also have to pay for its services. 
 This form explains what papers must 
 be served at the beginning of a guardi
 anship, who must be served with these 
 papers, how and when service must be 
 made, and how and when you, as a guar
 dianship petitioner, must prove to the 
 court that service has been made. You ca
 n find out more about the papers that yo
 u must file in another form available 
 from the court,

 New July 1, 2007
 What if the person served won™t take the papers or tears them up? The server must attempt to make personal delivery 
 (but peacefully! ) even if the person served won't take the papers. It 
 doesn't matter if the person tears them up or throws
 them down after they are 
 handed to him or her. 
 (A registered process server or sheriff's deputy will know how to complete 
 a good service. If you think someone who must be 
 personally served will try to avoid servi
 ce, it is a good idea to use one of
 these professionals to serve that person. ) 
 Who signs the Proof of Personal Service? Only the person who serves the 
 Notice of Hearing
 and the 
 Petition
 can sign Form GC 020 (P) . Neither you, any 
 other petitioner, nor the person 
 served may sign this form. 
 If more than one person personally serves papers, each
 server must fill out and si
 gn his or her own separate Form 
 GC 020 (P) 
 showing the names of the persons he or she serves. 
 How does the server personally serve the Notice of Hearing and the Petition? Ask the server to: Walk up to each person to
 be served and make sure he or she is the right person. 
 Hand each person copies of the filled out Notice of Hearing 
 and the Petition. 
 Fill out and sign 
 Form GC 020 (P) , Proof of Personal Service 
 of Notice of Hearing. If the server delivers papers to 
 more people than can be listed on this 
 form, ask the server to add the names of
 the additional people served on one or 
 more copies of 
 Form DE 120 (PA) /GC 20 (PA) , 
 Attachment to Notice of Hear
 ing Proof of Personal Service
 . Give the filled out and signed 
 Form GC 020 (P) and any attachment

 mailed to one of the followi
 ng persons for him or her instead of mailin

 the brother or sister is not necessary. ) 
 Any person having the physical care of the child who does not have legal custody of the child. 
 If your petition requests appointment of a guardi
 an of the person who is not related to the child, 
 the Director of the Department of Social Services, 
 Children™s Services Operations and Eval
 uation Branch, 744 P Street MS 3 34, 
 Sacramento, CA 95814.

 sister who lives with that brother or sister. 
 Your court may require you to serve oth
 er persons or organizations by mail. 
 Check your court's local rules and 
 practices to find out if this applies to you.

 If the child has developmental disabilities 
 and the person you want the court to
 appoint as guardian is: (1) not the 
 child's natural parent; (2) a provider of services to pers
 ons with developmental disab
 ilities or the spouse or an 
 employee of a provider; and (3) not a public agency, to the 
 Director of the Regional Center for the Developmentally 
 Disabled in the child's county. 
 (But see When must the 
 Notice of Hearing
 and the 
 Petition be served? 
 on 
 page 4 of this form for a special requirement fo
 r mailing papers to a Regional Center Director. ) 
 Who may be served by mail ? (Continued) Who need not be served (unless 
 the court orders otherwise) ? Unless the courts orders that they be served, you do not need
 to arrange for service on the parents or other relatives of a 
 child who has been relinquished
 to a licensed adoption agency
 , or the parents of a child a court has declared to be free 
 from the parents' custody and control. 
 How do I arrange for service by mail? SomeoneŠnot you or anyone else who signed the 
 Petition
 Šmust do the mailing to the persons and organizations 
 named above that are involved in your case. 
 ﬁDoing the mailingﬂ means actually pl
 acing the papers in the envelopes and 
 delivering the sealed envelopes into th
 e possession of the U. S. Postal Service . 
 Someone else can address the envelopes 
 and add the postage, but the pers
 on who signs the proof of service 
 (see below) must be able to say that he or she enclosed 
 the papers in the envelopes and delivered 
 the sealed envelopes to the U. S. Postal Se
 rvice on a certain date at a specific 
 place (city and state) , and that the addresses on the enve
 lopes were as they are shown in the proof of service. Who can serve by mail? The person doing the mailing must
 be at least 18 years of age. 
 He or she must not be a petitioner 
 or a proposed guardian in your case. 
 He or she must live or be employed in the county where th
 e mailing (deposit with the U. S. 
 Postal Service) takes place. 
 If the child is a patient in, or on leave from, 
 a state hospital run by the State Departments of Mental Health or 
 Developmental Disabilities, 
 to the Director of that department. The addre
 ss for the Director of Mental Health is 1600 
 Ninth Street, Room 151, Sacramento, CA 95814. The addres
 s for the Director of Develo
 pmental Disabilities is 1600 
 Ninth Street, Room 240, Sacramento, CA 95814, Attn. : Office of Legal Affairs. 
 If the child is or may be a Native Am
 erican, or has Native American ancestors, 
 there are additional mailing and 
 other requirements that may apply to 
 your case. These requirements are not di
 scussed in this form
 . If you can get on 
 the Internet, you can go to the Californ
 ia Courts Self Help Center Web site to
 get more information about the special requirements for a guardianship 
 involving a Native American child
 . The Web site's address is 
 www. courtinfo. ca. gov/selfhelp/family/guardianship (English) or www. courtinfo. ca. gov/selfhelp/espanol/familia/tutela (Spanish) . How does the server serve the Notice of Hearing and the Petition by mail? Deposit with the US. Postal Service, w
 ith first class postage prepaid, sealed en
 velopes (9" x 12" or 10" x 13" Manila 
 envelopes are recommended) addressed to
 the persons or organizations listed 
 above that apply to your case. The envelopes should contai
 n filled in copies of Form GC 020, 
 Notice of HearingŠGuardi
 anship or Conservatorship, 
 and the 
 Petition
 , including all attached pages mentioned in it. 
 Ask the server to: 
 Make sure the addresses shown on the envelopes for th
 e relatives of each child match the addresses shown for 
 these relatives in each child's Form GC 210 (CA) , Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information Attachment.

 What do I do with the completed Notice of Hearing and the attached proofs of personal service and service by mail? File with the court at least 5 days be
 fore your hearing date the original 
 Form GC 020, 
 Notice of HearingŠGuardianship or Conservatorship, 
 with the filled out and signed 
 Proof of Service on the second page, the 
 filled out, signed, and attached 
 Form GC 020 (P) , Proof of Personal Service of No
 tice of HearingŠGuardianship 
 or Conservatorship, and all attached pages showing 
 additional persons served. File these papers with the court as 
 soon as you can. The 5 day period mentioned above is a minimum time period. 
 If service must be made on the Director of the Regional
 Center for the Developmentally Disabled for the child's county, 
 service must be completed at least 30 days before the hearing
 . If the child in your case is developmentally 
 disabled and you think you may have to se
 rve a Regional Center director, when 
 you file your Petition you can ask the 
 clerk for a later hearing date because you wi
 ll need more time than usual to serve the 
 Notice of Hearing 
 and the Petition. 
 What happens if the papers
 aren't served in time? If the Notice of Hearing
 and 
 Petition
 aren't served in time, the court will have to
 continue (postpone) the hearing date on 
 your petition. This will delay appointment of a guardi
 an for the child or children 
 involved in your case. With the exception noted below, 
 personal service and service by ma
 il must be completed at least
 15 days before 
 the date of the hearing
 . When you file 
 Form GC 020
 , take an extra copy with yo
 u for the court to stamp, show
 ing that the original form 
 was filed on that day. 
 Bring that copy with you to the hearing. 
 When must the Notice of Hearing and the Petition be served? When you file your 
 Petition
 , the court clerk will give you a date and time when, and a courtroom or department 
 where, the judge will hear your requ
 est for appointment of a guardian. 
 Once you have the date, time, and place of the he
 aring, that information must be filled in on 
 Form GC 020, 
 Notice of HearingŠGuardianship or Conservatorship
 , and that form and the Petition, 
 with all pages attached to it, must then 
 be personally served or served by mail on the persons and 
 organizations mentioned above 
 that apply to your case. How does the server serve the Notice of Hearing and the Petition 
 by mail? (Continued) Fill out, date, and sign the 
 Proof of Service
 on the second page of the original 
 Form GC 020. 
 Don't sign that form yourself.

 s served by mail on one 
 or more copies of 
 Form DE 120 (MA) /GC 020 (MA) , Attachment to Notice of Hearing Proof of Service by
