COURT ORDER

To (name):                                                      , the responsible person:

The court orders the responsible person to repay to the court the cost of legal services rendered directly to him or her in 
this case in the amount of $            

The court orders the responsible person to repay to the court the cost of legal services rendered to the children named 
above in this case in the amount of $            

The court orders the responsible person to pay the court $                 on the (1st, 2nd, etc.):               day of every month, 
beginning on (date):                          until the amount is paid in full.

The court finds that the responsible person is unable to repay the cost of legal services rendered in this case directly 
to him or her or to the children named above and is not ordered to repay any costs.

Notwithstanding any determination of his or her ability to pay, the court does not order the responsible person to repay the 
cost of legal services rendered for the following reason:

a.

b.

He or she is receiving reunification services, and repayment will pose a barrier to reunification because it will 
limit his or her ability to comply with the requirements of the reunification plan or harm his or her ability to 
support the children; or

Requiring repayment would be unjust under the circumstances of the case.

This order is based on (check all that apply):

The court's review of the financial evaluation officer's recommendation as set forth on Recommendation Regarding 
Ability to Repay Cost of Legal Services (form JV-133).

The court's review of the responsible person's agreement and waiver as set forth on Response to Recommendation 
Regarding Ability to Repay Cost of Legal Services (form JV-134).

The court's review of the evidence presented at a contested hearing held on (date):

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
