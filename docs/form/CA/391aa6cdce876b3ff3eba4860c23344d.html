      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROGRAM OPERATORSLAWSUITS TO PROHIBIT ABUSE OR PROGRAM MISCONDUCT (Transitional Housing Misconduct Act) (Civil Code section 1954. 10 et seq. ) Read the "General Instructions" first. Then read the special instructions for program operators on page three. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONSWHO CAN GET ORDERS PROHIBITING ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT? Individuals or organizations that run a transitional housing program can ask the court for these orders. The Transitional Housing Misconduct Act applies only if the housing programis run by a government agency, a private nonprofit corporation that receives program funds from a 
 government agency, or an operator hired by one of the above to run the program; helps homeless persons obtain the skills necessary for independent living in permanent housing; includes regular individualized case management services; provides a structured living environment and requires compliance with program rules; andrestricts the occupancy period to not less than 30 days but not more than 24 months. Only the program operator can ask the court for orders against a participant. A program participant cannot ask the court for orders against a fellow participant, nor can program employees or neighbors of the program site ask for orders. The 
 program operator can, however, petition on their behalf. TO WHOM DO THESE ORDERS APPLY? A program operator can ask the court for orders against a homeless person who is now a participant in the housing 
 program. Someone is a homeless person if, before coming to the housing program, he or she lacked a regular and 
 adequate nighttime residence or the most recent nighttime residence wasa supervised shelter designed to provide temporary housing; or a place not designed or ordinarily used as sleeping accommodations for humans. Someone is a participant in a housing program if he or she signed a contract with the program as a condition to getting housing. The program operator can get orders only against a participant who has signed a contract that includesthe housing program's rules; a statement of the program operator's right of control and access over the unit occupied by the participant; anda restatement of the procedures and rights created by the Transitional Housing Misconduct Act. The program operator can ask for orders against the participant and anyone living with the participant at the program site. The operator must prove program misconduct or abuse, however, for each individual against whom orders are granted.

 Judicial Council of California 
 TH 200 [Rev. September 1, 2018] (1) (2) (3) (3) (2) (1) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) an institution that provides temporary housing for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or Page 1 of 8 Restraining orders issued under this act apply only to the persons named in the order. That means that if the court orders only one member of a family to move out of program housing, the rest of the family members may remain in the program 
 (unless they are all minors) . TH 200 WHEN CAN THE COURT MAKE ORDERS PROHIBITING ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT? Program operators can ask the court for orders if the participant has engaged in program misconduct or abuse. Theparticipant's conduct is program misconduct ifthe participant intentionally broke the program rules; the participant's conduct substantially interferes with the program operator's ability to run the housingprogram; andthe conduct relates todrunkenness, sale or use of drugs, theft, arson, or destruction of another person's property; orviolence or threats of violence directed at, and harassment of, immediate neighbors of the program site, 
 program employees, or other participants. The participant's conduct is abuse ifthe participant did or attempted to attack, strike, batter, or sexually assault other participants, program 
 employees, or immediate neighbors of the program site; orthe participant threatened to attack, strike, batter, or sexually assault the above individuals. WHAT KINDS OF ORDERS ARE AVAILABLE TO PREVENT ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT? A program operator can request a Temporary Restraining Order or a "permanent" order (Order After Hearing) , or both. These both are court orders forbidding someone from engaging in the activity described in the order. A Temporary 
 Restraining Order is issued by a judge after a request for a permanent order has been filed, but before there has been a 
 full hearing. Permanent orders can be issued only after a full hearing before a judge, where both the participant and the 
 program operator can be represented by attorneys and have the opportunity to present evidence. TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS ("TRO") BEFORE THE HEARINGA TRO orders the participant to stop the abuse or misconduct and goes into effect immediately. The order lasts a maxi- 
 mum of five days. The court may not be able to grant a hearing within five days, in which case the order will last until the 
 hearing. To get a TRO the program operator must prove that the participant has engaged in program misconduct or abuse 
 and that great or irreparable harm will result before the hearing if the TRO is not granted. In limited circumstances, the judge can use a TRO to order the participant to move out. The judge will do this only if it is necessary to protect another participant, a program employee, or an individual who lives within 100 feet of the program 
 site from imminent serious bodily injury. To get a TRO excluding the participant from program housing, the program 
 operator must provide clear and convincing evidence that the participant engaged in abuse and that great or irreparable 
 injury will result before the hearing if the participant is not ordered to move out or stay away from the housing program, or 
 both. If the participant has been living in program housing under contract for six months or longer, the program operator cannot get a TRO unless an action is pending against the participant or a TRO is already in effect and is subject to further orders. 
 The program operator may still use unlawful detainer procedures or file for a permanent order only. You must give notice to the participant before asking for a TRO. Notice requires you to show the judge thatbefore applying for the TRO you told the participant or the participant's attorney when and where the application would be made; oryou made a good faith effort to tell the participant or the participant's attorney; oryou should not have to give notice because great harm would result to a program operator, participant, or immediate neighbor of the program site before the hearing. ORDER AFTER HEARING ("PERMANENT" ORDERS) Temporary restraining orders last a maximum of five days or until the hearing. When the judge issues the TRO, he or she 
 will set a date for the hearing on the permanent order (also called the Order After Hearing or "injunction") . A "per manent" 
 order issued after a hearing lasts up to one year. The program operator seeking the order must have the following papers delivered (served) to the participant at leasttwo days before the hearinga copy of the Order to Show Cause (Transitional Housing Misconduct) ; a copy of the Temporary Restraining Orders (if any) ; a copy of the Petition for Order Prohibiting Abuse or Program Misconduct; (1) (2) (3) (1) (2) (3) a blank Participant's Response (Transitional Housing Misconduct) ; two copies of a blank Attached Declaration (form MC 031) ; (4)

September 1, 2018] Page 2 of 8 TH 200 Order After Hearing continueda blank Proof of Personal Service (Transitional Housing Misconduct) ; a copy of these instructions; andcopies of all materials (affidavits and supporting memoranda) to be used in the hearing. (6) (7) (8) The Order to Show Cause must contain the name and phone number of the Legal Services Office in the county where the petition was filed, and must inform the participant this office may be called for legal advice about responding to the 
 request for court orders. In limited circumstances the court will make a permanent order for the participant to move out of or keep away from the program site. To get this type of order, the program operator must provide clear and convincing evidence that the 
 participant engaged in abuse and that great or irreparable injury will result if the order is not granted. WHAT IS NEEDED TO GET THE COURT ORDERS OR TO OBJECT TO THEM? Transitional Housing Misconduct forms, available from the superior court clerk's office or from legal publishers. The 
 court clerk can tell you where to get the forms. A typewriter with which to fill out the forms. The forms should be typed. Some volunteer legal service groups have typewriters you can use, and some libraries offer the use of typewriters for a small fee. If you cannot type, print clearly. Money for a court filing fee, unless the court excuses you from paying. If you cannot afford to pay the court filing fee, ask the clerk for the Information Sheet on Waiver of Court Fees and Costs. If you are a participant objecting to the 
 court orders, you do not have to pay to file your response. Someone 18 years of age or older to deliver (serve) certain papers to the other party. This person must be someone other than yourself, and not an employee of the program. WHAT FORMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR OBTAINING OR OPPOSING AN ORDER? Petition for Order Prohibiting Abuse or Program Misconduct [''Petition"] . This four page form tells the judge the facts of the program operator's case and what orders the program operator wants the judge to make. Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order ["OSC/TRO"] . The judge signs this order to tell the participant to come to court for the court hearing. It may contain court orders that take effect immediately and stay in effect for up to five days or until the hearing. Participant's Response ["Response"] . The participant may file this form to object to the orders the program operator asked the court to make, and to give his or her side of the story. Order After Hearing [''Order''] . This is the permanent order or injunction. This form is signed by the court following the hearing. It will expire in one year or less unless the court terminates, modifies, or extends it. Proof of Personal Service. This form shows that a participant or program operator has been served with legal papers as required by law. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PROGRAM OPERATORSTEPS TO TAKE TO GET A COURT ORDERComplete the forms. Fill in the Petition and the OSC/TRO except for the date of the court hearing and the judge's 
 signature. (Remember, most courts require that all forms be typewritten. ) If you are not represented by an attorney, fill in the name of the person signing the petition, the program name, 
 mailing address, and phone number at the top of each form. If you do not want to disclose your home or work 
 address or phone number, you may use an address or phone number where you will be able to receive any 
 communications. Fill in the name of the county where the action will be filed and the address of the superior court. Type your full name and the participant's full name. Mark with an "X" all boxes that apply to your case. Read each item carefully and fill in the necessary information. Be specific.

September 1, 2018] Page 3 of 8 TH 200 Steps to Take to Get a Court Order (continued) 2. Make copies. You will need at least five copies of each Transitional Housing Misconduct form: one for a worksheet, the original to file with the court, a copy to be personally delivered (served) to the participant, and two 
 copies for yourself. You will need more than five copies of the OSC/TRO, the Order, and the Proof of Service form. In 
 additionto the five copies above, get one for each law enforcement agency you want to enforce your orders, and two 
 for yourself. 3. TRO. If you are requesting a TRO you must give details of the participant's misconduct or abuse, the problems it has 
 caused you, and why you need an order before a full hearing. Place an "X" in the box marked "To be ordered now and 
 to be effective until the hearing" under numbers 8, 9, 10, 11, or 13 on the Petition. 4. Court clerk. Take all your completed forms and all copies to the clerk's office in the superior court. The clerk will tell 
 you where to take your papers and when to pay your filing fee, if required. 5. Court papers. If the judge signs the OSC/TRO, take the original and all copies back to the court clerk. The clerk will 
 stamp all the papers with a case number. The copies must include an "Endorsed Filed" stamp (showing the date of 
 filing) , the judge's signature, and the date of signing. The clerk will file the originals and give you the copies. KEEP 
 TWO ENDORSED FILED COPIES FOR YOURSELF. Carry one with you and keep one in a safe place. You may 
 need one if you have to call the police. 6. Personal service. Have the participant personally served with copies of the Petition and the OSC/TRO, a blank copy 
 of the Response, two blank copies of form MC 031, a blank copy of the Proof of Personal Service, a copy of these 
 instructions, and a copy of all materials (affidavits and supporting memoranda) to be used in the hearing. On the OSC/
 TRO you must fill in the box on the first page with the name, address, and phone number of the Legal Services Office 
 in the county in which the petition is filed. You cannot serve the participant yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process server, the sheriff's department, or any person 18 years of age or older, other than you or a program employee. The papers must be 
 delivered to the participant personally, and cannot be mailed or left at the participant's dwelling unit. Service is very important. It tells the participant about the order and the hearing. Without it there will not bea court hearing and your TRO will no longer be good unless it is extended by the court. The participant must bepersonally 
 served at least two days before the hearing. 7. Copy to the police. If you have requested a TRO and the judge has granted them, immediately deliver copies to eachlaw enforcement agency (police, marshal, or sheriff's office) that you want to enforce the order. 8. After service. After the participant has been personally served, the person who served the participant must complete and sign the original of the Proof of Personal Service form. Take the signed original and the copies back to the court 
 clerk. The clerk will file the original and stamp "Endorsed Filed" on the copies. Deliver one Endorsed Filed copy to 
 each law enforcement agency at which you filed your TRO. Keep two Endorsed Filed copies for yourself. 9. Court hearing. Go to the court hearing with any evidence you have. Any witnesses to the participant's conduct also should come to the hearing. The Order should be filled in and given to the judge for signing. 10. File the Order. If the judge signs the Order, file the original with the clerk, get the copies stamped with an "Endorsed Filed" stamp, and immediately deliver copies to law enforcement agencies. If the participant was not present in court for the hearing, arrange to have the participant personally served with a copy of the Order. File the completed Proof of Personal Service with the court and deliver copies stamped "Endorsed Filed" 
 to law enforcement agencies. KEEP TWO COPIES FOR YOURSELF. Carry one with you and keep one in a safe 
 place. 11. Renewal. An Order will expire within one year, but you can apply for an extension. The law requires you to file for a 
 renewal by filing a new Petition any time within three months before the Order expires. Do not check the modification 
 box on the Petition when you file for renewal. WHAT TO DO IF THE PARTICIPANT DISOBEYS THE ORDER 1. Reports. Report violations of the Order as soon as possible to your local law enforcement agency. Keep a written 
 record of the incidents and obtain copies of police reports concerning them. 2. Contempt of court. Violation of a restraining order is punishable by civil contempt of court. You must file a civil con tempt action in the same court that issued the restraining order. If the participant is in contempt of court, you can file 
 for a modification of the order (use form TH 100) and ask the court to order the participant to move out of the program 
 housing. NOTE: See sample filled in Petition on pages 5Œ8. (Continued on reverse) INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROGRAM OPERATORS (Transitional Housing Misconduct) TH 200 [Rev. September 1, 2018] Page 4 of 8 TH 200 The next four pages show a Petition that has been completed with examples of the kind of
