      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROGRAM OPERATORS
LAWSUITS TO PROHIBIT ABUSE OR PROGRAM MISCONDUCT
(Transitional Housing Misconduct Act)
(Civil Code section 1954.10 et seq.)

TH-200

Read the "General Instructions" first. Then read the special instructions for program operators 
on page three.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

WHO CAN GET ORDERS PROHIBITING ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT?

Individuals or organizations that run a transitional housing program can ask the court for these orders. The Transitional 
Housing Misconduct Act applies only if the housing program

(1)

(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

is run by a government agency, a private nonprofit corporation that receives program funds from a  
government agency, or an operator hired by one of the above to run the program;
helps homeless persons obtain the skills necessary for independent living in permanent housing;
includes regular individualized case management services;
provides a structured living environment and requires compliance with program rules; and
restricts the occupancy period to not less than 30 days but not more than 24 months.

Only the program operator can ask the court for orders against a participant. A program participant cannot ask the court 
for orders against a fellow participant, nor can program employees or neighbors of the program site ask for orders. The 
program operator can, however, petition on their behalf.

TO WHOM DO THESE ORDERS APPLY?

A program operator can ask the court for orders against a homeless person who is now a participant in the housing 
program. Someone is a homeless person if, before coming to the housing program, he or she lacked a regular and 
adequate nighttime residence or the most recent nighttime residence was

(1)

(2)

(3)

a supervised shelter designed to provide temporary housing; or 

an institution that provides temporary housing for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or

a place not designed or ordinarily used as sleeping accommodations for humans.

Someone is a participant in a housing program if he or she signed a contract with the program as a condition to getting 
housing. The program operator can get orders only against a participant who has signed a contract that includes

(3)

(1)
(2)

the housing program's rules;
a statement of the program operator's right of control and access over the unit occupied by the 
participant; and
a restatement of the procedures and rights created by the Transitional Housing Misconduct Act.
The program operator can ask for orders against the participant and anyone living with the participant at the program site. 
The operator must prove program misconduct or abuse, however, for each individual against whom orders are granted.    
Restraining orders issued under this act apply only to the persons named in the order. That means that if the court orders 
only one member of a family to move out of program housing, the rest of the family members may remain in the program 
(unless they are all minors).

TH-200

WHEN CAN THE COURT MAKE ORDERS PROHIBITING ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT?

Program operators can ask the court for orders if the participant has engaged in program misconduct or abuse. 
Theparticipant's conduct is program misconduct if

(1)
(2)

(3)

the participant intentionally broke the program rules;
the participant's conduct substantially interferes with the program operator's ability to run the 
housingprogram; and
the conduct relates to
(a)
(b)

drunkenness, sale or use of drugs, theft, arson, or destruction of another person's property; or
violence or threats of violence directed at, and harassment of, immediate neighbors of the program site, 
program employees, or other participants.

The participant's conduct is abuse if

(1)

(2)

the participant did or attempted to attack, strike, batter, or sexually assault other participants, program 
employees, or immediate neighbors of the program site; or
the participant threatened to attack, strike, batter, or sexually assault the above individuals.

WHAT KINDS OF ORDERS ARE AVAILABLE TO PREVENT ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT?

A program operator can request a Temporary Restraining Order or a "permanent" order (Order After Hearing), or both. 
These both are court orders forbidding someone from engaging in the activity described in the order. A Temporary 
Restraining Order is issued by a judge after a request for a permanent order has been filed, but before there has been a 
full hearing. Permanent orders can be issued only after a full hearing before a judge, where both the participant and the 
program operator can be represented by attorneys and have the opportunity to present evidence.

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS ("TRO") BEFORE THE HEARING

A TRO orders the participant to stop the abuse or misconduct and goes into effect immediately. The order lasts a maxi- 
mum of five days. The court may not be able to grant a hearing within five days, in which case the order will last until the 
hearing. To get a TRO the program operator must prove that the participant has engaged in program misconduct or abuse 
and that great or irreparable harm will result before the hearing if the TRO is not granted.
In limited circumstances, the judge can use a TRO to order the participant to move out. The judge will do this only if it is 
necessary to protect another participant, a program employee, or an individual who lives within 100 feet of the program 
site from imminent serious bodily injury. To get a TRO excluding the participant from program housing, the program 
operator must provide clear and convincing evidence that the participant engaged in abuse and that great or irreparable 
injury will result before the hearing if the participant is not ordered to move out or stay away from the housing program, or 
both.
If the participant has been living in program housing under contract for six months or longer, the program operator cannot 
get a TRO unless an action is pending against the participant or a TRO is already in effect and is subject to further orders. 
The program operator may still use unlawful detainer procedures or file for a permanent order only. 

You must give notice to the participant before asking for a TRO. Notice requires you to show the judge that

(1)

(2)

(3)

before applying for the TRO you told the participant or the participant's attorney when and where the 
application would be made; or
you made a good-faith effort to tell the participant or the participant's attorney; or
you should not have to give notice because great harm would result to a program operator, participant, or 
immediate neighbor of the program site before the hearing.

ORDER AFTER HEARING ("PERMANENT" ORDERS)
Temporary restraining orders last a maximum of five days or until the hearing. When the judge issues the TRO, he or she 
will set a date for the hearing on the permanent order (also called the Order After Hearing or "injunction"). A "per-manent" 
order issued after a hearing lasts up to one year.
The program operator seeking the order must have the following papers delivered (served) to the participant at leasttwo 
days before the hearing

(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

a copy of the Order to Show Cause (Transitional Housing Misconduct);
a copy of the Temporary Restraining Orders (if any);
a copy of the Petition for Order Prohibiting Abuse or Program Misconduct;
a blank Participant's Response (Transitional Housing Misconduct);
two copies of a blank Attached Declaration (form MC-031);

a blank Proof of Personal Service (Transitional Housing Misconduct);

The Order to Show Cause must contain the name and phone number of the Legal Services Office in the county where the 
petition was filed, and must inform the participant this office may be called for legal advice about responding to the 
request for court orders.
In limited circumstances the court will make a permanent order for the participant to move out of or keep away from the 
program site. To get this type of order, the program operator must provide clear and convincing evidence that the 
participant engaged in abuse and that great or irreparable injury will result if the order is not  granted.

WHAT IS NEEDED TO GET THE COURT ORDERS OR TO OBJECT TO THEM?
Transitional Housing Misconduct forms, available from the superior court clerk's office or from legal publishers. The 
court clerk can tell you where to get the forms.
A typewriter with which to fill out the forms. The forms should be typed. Some volunteer legal service groups have 
typewriters you can use, and some libraries offer the use of typewriters for a small fee. If you cannot type, print clearly.
Money for a court filing fee, unless the court excuses you from paying. If you cannot afford to pay the court filing fee, 
ask the clerk for the Information Sheet on Waiver of Court Fees and Costs. If you are a participant objecting to the 
court orders, you do not have to pay to file your response.
Someone 18 years of age or older to deliver (serve) certain papers to the other party. This person must be someone 
other than yourself, and not an employee of the program.

WHAT FORMS ARE AVAILABLE FOR OBTAINING OR OPPOSING AN ORDER?

Petition for Order Prohibiting Abuse or Program Misconduct [''Petition"]. This four-page form tells the judge the 
facts of  the program operator's case and what orders the program operator wants the judge to make.
Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order ["OSC/TRO"]. The judge signs this order to tell the 
participant to come to court for the court hearing. It may contain court orders that take effect immediately and stay in 
effect for up to five days or until the hearing.
Participant's Response ["Response"]. The participant may file this form to object to the orders the program operator 
asked the court to make, and to give his or her side of the story.
Order After Hearing [''Order'']. This is the permanent order or injunction. This form is signed by the court following 
the hearing. It will expire in one year or less unless the court terminates, modifies, or extends it.
Proof of Personal Service. This form shows that a participant or program operator has been served with legal papers 
as required by law.

Steps to Take to Get a Court Order (continued)
2.  Make copies. You will need at least five copies of each Transitional Housing Misconduct form: one for a 

worksheet,the original to file with the court, a copy to be personally delivered (served) to the participant, and two 
copies for yourself. You will need more than five copies of the OSC/TRO, the Order, and the Proof of Service form. In 
additionto the five copies above, get one for each law  enforcement agency you want to enforce your orders, and two 
for yourself.

3.  TRO. If you are requesting a TRO you must give details of the participant's misconduct or abuse, the problems it has 

caused you, and why you need an order before a full hearing. Place an "X" in the box marked "To be ordered now and 
to be effective until the hearing" under numbers 8, 9,10, 11, or 13 on the Petition.

4.  Court clerk. Take all your completed forms and all copies to the clerk's office in the superior court. The clerk will tell 

you where to take your papers and when to pay your filing fee, if required.

5.  Court papers. If the judge signs the OSC/TRO, take the original and all copies back to the court clerk. The clerk will 
stamp all the papers with a case number. The copies must include an "Endorsed-Filed" stamp (showing the date of 
filing), the judge's signature, and the date of signing. The clerk will file the originals and give you the copies. KEEP 
TWO ENDORSED-FILED COPIES FOR YOURSELF. Carry one with you and keep one in a safe place. You may 
need one if you have to call the police.

6.  Personal service. Have the participant personally served with copies of the Petition and the OSC/TRO, a blank copy 
of the Response, two blank copies of form MC-031, a blank copy of the Proof of Personal Service, a copy of these 
instructions, and a copy of all materials (affidavits and supporting memoranda) to be used in the hearing. On the OSC/
TRO you must fill in the box on the first page with the name, address, and phone number of the Legal Services Office 
in the county in which the petition is filed.
You cannot serve the participant yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process server, the sheriff's 
department, or any person 18 years of age or older, other than you or a program employee. The papers must be 
delivered to the participant personally, and cannot be mailed or left at the participant's dwelling unit.
Service is very important. It tells the participant about the order and the hearing. Without it there will not bea court 
hearing and your TRO will no longer be good unless it is extended by the court. The participant must bepersonally 
served at least two days before the hearing.

7.  Copy to the police. If you have requested a TRO and the judge has granted them, immediately deliver copies to 

eachlaw enforcement agency (police, marshal, or sheriff's office) that you want to enforce the order.

8.  After service. After the participant has been personally served, the person who served the participant must complete 
and sign the original of the Proof of Personal Service form. Take the signed original and the copies back to the court 
clerk. The clerk will file the original and stamp "Endorsed-Filed" on the copies. Deliver one Endorsed-Filed copy to 
each law enforcement agency at which you filed your TRO. Keep two Endorsed-Filed copies for yourself.

9.  Court hearing. Go to the court hearing with any evidence you have. Any witnesses to the participant's conduct also 

should come to the hearing. The Order should be filled in and given to the judge for signing.

10. File the Order. If the judge signs the Order, file the original with the clerk, get the copies stamped with an "Endorsed-

Filed" stamp, and immediately deliver copies to law enforcement agencies.
If the participant was not present in court for the hearing, arrange to have the participant personally served with a copy 
of the Order. File the completed Proof of Personal Service with the court and deliver copies stamped "Endorsed-Filed" 
to law enforcement agencies. KEEP TWO COPIES FOR YOURSELF. Carry one with you and keep one in a safe 
place.

11. Renewal. An Order will expire within one year, but you can apply for an extension. The law requires you to file for a 

renewal by filing a new Petition any time within three months before the Order expires. Do not check the modification 
box on the Petition when you file for renewal.

WHAT TO DO IF THE PARTICIPANT DISOBEYS THE ORDER

1.  Reports. Report violations of the Order as soon as possible to your local law enforcement agency. Keep a written 

record of the incidents and obtain copies of police reports concerning them.

2.  Contempt of court. Violation of a restraining order is punishable by civil contempt of court. You must file a civil con-
tempt action in the same court that issued the restraining order. If the participant is in contempt of court, you can file 
for a modification of the order (use form TH-100) and ask the court to order the participant to move out of the program 
housing.

NOTE: See sample filled-in Petition on pages 5–8.

cursed at him and told him to mind his own business. (Rule 7(a).)
     On June 26, 1992, participant's wife had a cut lip and large bruise near her mouth 
as a result of participant's actions. (Rule 7(b).) That evening, participant returned 
home sober, but told the night manager (John Roe) that he (participant) would "get him" 
if he intervened between participant and his wife again. (Rule 7(a).)
     Several residents have complained about the noise made by participant. Partici-
pant's drinking interferes with other residents' efforts to refrain from drinking. 
Residents do not understand why participant is not disciplined for breaking the pro- 
gram rules against drinking and disruptive behavior. (Rule 7(b).) The night manager is 
afraid to work a shift alone when participant might again return home drunk. (Rule 
7(a).)

NEED FOR IMMEDIATE ORDER BEFORE THE HEARING. Program operator, program participants, or persons living 
within 100 feet of the program site will suffer great and irreparable harm before this petition can be heard in court unless 
the court makes those orders requested above effective now and until the hearing. (Specify the harm andwhy it will 
occur before the hearing.  For temporary exclusion orders under items 10-11, show emergency and need to prevent 
imminent serious bodily injury.)

     Participant has threatened the night manager (John Roe), and 
the manager is afraid to work a shift alone in participant's 
building. The program has a limited staff, and we cannot replace 
John until the hearing. Other participants have been disturbed by 
participant's behavior and we need to be able to restrain him to 
continue to operate the program in his building. The night manager 
may need the assistance of the police to protect Margaret Doe from 
her husband if participant again returns home drunk.
