 JURY 002 [Rev. September 1, 2018] JUROR QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CRIMINAL CASES/Code of Civil Procedure section 205 (c) - (d) AJUROR QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CRIMINAL CASESForm JURY 002 (Optional Form) Code of Civil Procedure Section 205 (c) Œ (d) Sec. 1. Statutory Authority This Juror Questionnaire has been drafted under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 205 (c) Œ (d) and is intended to expedite jury selection. It is not intended to alter statutes or rules governing the authority of the court or the role of counsel during voir dire. Sec. 2. Use Notes for Courts A. General This Juror Questionnaire is an optional form and is NOT intended to constitute the complete examination of prospective jurors. The utility and appropriateness of this questionnaire to a particular case is at the discretion of the judge. Particular kinds of cases may require that this questionnaire be altered or augmented with the participation of counsel. B. Pre Voir Dire Conference Rule of Court 4. 200 requires that the court confer with counsel about voir dire before a jury panel is called. At this conference, the court may establish (1) guidelines for the use of the Juror Questionnaire, (2) any supplemental questions to be propounded to the panel by questionnaire, (3) the extent of the court's oral inquiry of the panel, and (4) the extent of oral questioning by counsel. Arrangements for duplication of completed questionnaires should be confirmed. C. Introduction of Questionnaire to Prospective Jurors It is suggested that the Juror Questionnaire be used after the court has given its customary introductory remarks and any additional instructions that the court deems appropriate. The court also may wish to tell the panel members that a questionnaire will be used, to encourage complete answers, and to remind them that their answers will be given under penalty of perjury. In introducing the questionnaire, the court should instruct prospective jurors how to proceed if they have difficulty reading or filling out the form. It is not recommended that the court direct the jury commissioner to give the Juror Questionnaire to prospective jurors in the jury assembly room. This procedure ordinarily will mean that jurors are not given complete instructions about the type of case they will hear or the identity of participants and witnesses. In addition, jurors who fill out the form before appearing in the trial court may not clearly understand that their answers are given under penalty of perjury. For these reasons, and to avoid the need to have jurors fill out supplemental questionnaires once they have been sent to the trial court, it is strongly recommended that the Juror Questionnaire be used in the trial court setting. JURY 002 JUROR QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CRIMINAL CASES/Code of Civil Procedure section 205 (c) - (d) JURY 002 [Rev. September 1, 2018] BJUROR QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CRIMINAL CASESIntroduction and Instructions Thank you for coming to court as a potential juror. Before the case can start, a jury must be selected. The judge and the parties need to know information about you and people you know in order to select jurors who can be fair to both sides. Everyone has attitudes and opinions that are shaped by their life experiences. Sometimes these experiences can make it difficult to look at a certain issue in an unbiased and unemotional way. As a juror, you must return a verdict based on the law and on the facts proved in court. The judge will give you instructions on the law and on how you should go about deciding the case. You must listen to and follow the judge's instructions. The questions on this form are designed to help the court and the lawyers learn something about your background and your views on issues that may be related to this case. The questions are asked not to invade your privacy, but to make sure that you can be a fair and impartial juror. In portions of this form, you will see the term ﬁperson with whom you share a significant personal relationship. ﬂ That term means a former spouse, domestic partner, life partner, or anyone with whom you have an influential or intimate relationship that you would characterize as important. As you answer the questions that follow, please keep in mind that there are no ﬁrightﬂ or ﬁwrongﬂ answers. The only right answer is one that reflects how you honestly feel. Please make sure your answers are as complete as possible. Complete answers are far more helpful and may help shorten the time it takes to select a jury. If you have trouble reading, understanding, or filling out this form, please let the court staff know. If a question does not apply to you please write in ﬁN/Aﬂ for ﬁnot applicableﬂ rather than leave the question blank. The information you provide will become part of the court record in this case and will be a public document that is accessible to anyone. Some of the questions may require information that is personal and sensitive to you, and you may be reluctant to talk about this information with the other prospective jurors and the public present. If this is so, write ﬁprivateﬂ next to the question and the court may then give you an opportunity to share your information on the record with only the judge, counsel, the defendant, and the court reporter present. The answers you provide will, under most circumstances, be included as part of the public record but you may not have to share the information in open court. PLEASE PUT THE LAST FOUR DIGITS OF YOUR JUROR IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FOUND ON YOUR JUROR BADGE ON THE TOP OF EACH PAGE. REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. YOUR ANSWERS MUST BE TRUE AND COMPLETE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP IN SELECTING A FAIR JURY.

YESNOJURY 002 [Rev. September 1, 2018] C 8 THE FOLLOWING IS A PRINCIPLE OF LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL CRIMINAL CASES: A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent. This presumption requires that the People prove each element of a crime [and special allegation] beyond a reasonable doubt. Whenever the judge tells you the People must prove something, the judge means they must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt [unless the judge specifically tells you otherwise] . Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. In deciding whether the People have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, you must impartially compare and consider all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial. Unless the evidence proves the defendant [s] guilty beyond a reasonable 
 doubt, (he/she/they) (is/are) entitled to an acquittal and you must find (him/her/they) not guilty. (CALCRIM No. 130) DO YOU UNDERSTAND THIS PRINCIPLE OF LAW? DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS PRINCIPLE OF LAW? WILL YOU FOLLOW THIS PRINCIPLE OF LAW? 1. 341. 35 Juror ID number Case number JURY 002 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO COURT FOR ANY OTHER REASON?

YESNOIF YES, PLEASE EXPLAIN: WOULD THE FACT THAT A WITNESS IS A MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CAUSE YOU TO AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE OR DISBELIEVE HIS OR HER TESTIMONY? 1. 38 YESNOIF YES, PLEASE EXPLAIN: JURY 002 [Rev. September 1, 2018] JUROR QUESTIONNAIRE FOR CRIMINAL CASESCapital Case Supplement By asking the following questions regarding your feelings or opinions about capital punishment, the court is not suggesting in any way that you will ever need to decide this question. The court does not know in advance what the evidence in this case will be or whether you will find a defendant guilty or not guilty of any charge at all. The court is asking the following questions because if a defendant is found guilty of murder in the first degree as well as what we call "special circumstances" that have been charged, the possible sentences to be decided in a separate penalty trial are the sentence of death or the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. A defendant may also be acquitted or found guilty of lesser charges, which means there never will be a penalty trial. Since we do not know in advance what your decisions may be, the court must know whether you could be fair to all sides on the issue of punishment if and only if a penalty trial is necessary. To clarify, you will only make a sentence decision between life without the possibility of parole and death in a separate penalty trial if you find a defendant guilty of murder in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt and you find a "special circumstance" (to be defined for you later) true. If the penalty trial is necessary you will first hear evidence and arguments from counsel. The law also provides very specific guidelines as to what a jury can consider in deciding the sentence in this separate penalty trial. These guidelines are called "aggravating factors" and "mitigating factors" and are explained in Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions number 763: *In reaching your decision, you must consider and weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances or factors shown by the evidence. An aggravating circumstance or factor is any fact, condition, or event relating to the commission of a crime, above and beyond the elements of the crime itself, that increases the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct, the enormity of the offense, or the harmful impact of the crime. An aggravating circumstance may support a decision to impose the death penalty. A mitigating circumstance or factor is any fact, condition, or event that makes the death penalty less appropriate as a punishment, even though it does not legally justify or excuse the crime. A mitigating circumstance is something that reduces the defendant's blameworthiness or otherwise supports a less severe punishment. A mitigating circumstance may support a decision not to impose the death penalty.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields and Utilization:<sup>*</sup></h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
