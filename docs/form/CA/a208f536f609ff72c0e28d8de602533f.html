 It is important that you understand that changing your 
 name, especially confidentially, is a life
 -changing decision
 . It may make it more difficult for you to enforce a 
 restraining order and significantly impair your ability to 
 obtain a passport, 
 apply 
 for school programs, 
 purchase or 
 rent property, gain employment, 
 get
 credit, start a business, 
 and other matters
 . The law provides confidentiality for a petitioner seeking a 
 name change who is a participant in the Secretary of State
 ™s confidential 
 address
 program
 , Safe at Home
 , under 
 Government Code section 6205 et seq. , 
 and
 who asserts 
 reasons for a name change that include 
 seeking 
 (1) to avoid 
 domestic violence, (
 2) to avoid stalking, (
 3) to avoid 
 sexual 
 assault
 , or (4) to avoid human trafficking
 . (One o
 f these 
 reasons must be stated in the papers filed with the 
 Petition 
 for Change of Name
 . ) 
 By law, the court must keep the current legal name of such 
 a petitioner confidential. The court must not publish or post 
 the name in the court
 ™s calendars, indexes, 
 or registers of 
 actions, or in any other place in which it might be 
 accessible to the public. In addition, the proposed new name 
 is not put into the court records at all and does not have to 
 be published. (Code Civ. Proc. , § 1277 (b) . ) 
 To ensure this confi
 dentiality for the name change 
 proceeding, petitioners must follow the instructions below. 
 You are not required to have a lawyer, but it is highly
 advisable that you contact a lawyer or legal service agency 
 to discuss the effects of a confidential nam
 e change
 . Before beginning the court process for a 
 confidential 
 name 
 change, 
 you 
 must be an active p
 articipant in the Safe at 
 Home p
 rogram. 
 You
 must complete and file a Notice of 
 Intent of Name Change with the Safe at Home program at 
 the 
 Secretary of 
 State
 ™s Office
 . You
 will receive a letter 
 from that program to show to the court, confirming that 
 the 
 you are
 an active participant in the confidential address 
 program and that a Notice of Intent of Name Change is on 
 file. 
 You
 can reach the Safe at Home pr
 ogram by calling 
 toll free 
 1 877 322 5227 or by going to the 
 Web site at 
 www. sos. ca. gov/safeathome
 . As with all name change petitions, the petition filed under 
 the confidential address program must be filed in the 
 superior court of the county where th
 e person whose name 
 is to be changed presently lives. 
 The petition may be used to change one™s own name and, 
 under certain circumstances, the names of others (e. g. , 
 children under 18 years of age) . 
 There are no filing fees for 
 minors in the Safe at Ho
 me program. 
 A petitioner in the confidential address program must 
 comply with all the rules 
 stated
 in item 8 in the 
 Instructions
 on the back of the 
 Petition for Change of Name
 , concerning 
 serving notice of a name change petition for a child on the 
 chi
 ld™s parents or grandparents. The confidentiality 
 provisions do not change those requirements. 
 You
 will 
 generally not be able to change a child
 ™s name without 
 notifying the other parent
 . 
 Prepare an original and two copies of the forms described in 
 item 4 of the 
 Instructions
 on the back of the 
 Petition for 
 Change of Name 
 (form NC
 -100) . In addition: 
 a. In the
 Petition for Change of Name 
 (form NC
 -100) , 
 Order to Show Cause for Change of Name 
 (form NC
 -120) , and 
 Decree Changing Name 
 (form NC
 -130) , include you
 r present na
 me where indicated. I
 nstead of 
 including the proposed new name, indicate that the new 
 name is confidential and on file with the S
 ecretary of 
 State™s Safe at Home p
 rogram. 
 b. In the 
 Attachment to the P
 etition
 for Change of Name
 (form NC
 -110) , in
 clude the reasons for seeking the 
 name change. 
 c. Prepare
 and attach to the front of each document a 
 Confidential Cov
 er Sheet
 ŠName Change Proceeding
 Under Address Confidentialit
 y Program
 (Safe at Home
 ) (form NC
 -400) . Do not include 
 the 
 petitioner
 ™s current 
 name on th
 ese forms. These 
 forms will flag the 
 documents as containing confidential information. 
 You will also need a copy of the letter from the S
 afe at 
 Home program to take to 
 the court when filing the petition, 
 to confirm that 
 you are
 in the confidenti
 al address
 program 
 and 
 have 
 a Notice of Intent of Name Change on file. Keep a 
 
 copy of that letter for your records. 
 Follow the instructions in item 5 of the 
 Instructions 
 on the 
 back of the

 (form NC

 Civil Case Cover Sheet 
 (form CM

 , your petition, 
 and any other document you file under that 
 item. 
 You should request a date for the hearing on the 
 Order to 
 Show Cause 
 For Change of Name 
 at least si
 x weeks after 
 the date you file the petition. Take the complet
 ed form to 
 the clerk™s office. 
 The clerk will provide the hearing date 
 and location, obtain the judicial officer
 ™s signature, file the 
 original, and give you a copy. 
 In most cases, the 
 Order to Show Cause 
 must be published 
 in a local newspaper of general circulation. But 
 a petitioner 
 does not have to publish the order if 
 he or she is
 a participant
 in the address confidentiality program and the 
 petition alleges that 
 he or she 
 (1) is 
 petiti
 oning to avoid 
 domestic violence, (
 2) is petitioning to avoid stalking, or 
 (3) is, or is filing on behalf of, a victim of sexual assault. 
 If no written objection is filed at least two court days before 
 the hearing, the court may grant the petitio
 n without a 
 hearing. Check with the court to find out if a hearing will be 
 held. If there is a hearing, bring copies of all documents to 
 the hearing. If the judge grants the petition, the judge will 
 sign the original decree. 
 If a petitioner in the co
 nfidential address program believes 
 that the protections described above and required by law 
 that 
 keeping the current and future name confidential are 
 not sufficient in a particular case, 
 the 
 petitioner may ask the 
 court to file the petition and related do
 cuments under seal. 
 Documents filed under seal are secured and kept separate 
 from the public files. 
 For the court to order that the petition may be filed under 
 seal, 
 you
 must show facts to support the following findings 
 by the court: 
 a. 
 There is an o
 verriding interest that overcomes the right 
 of public access to the record. 
 b. That overriding interest supports sealing the name 
 
 change documents. 
 c. 
 A substantial probability exists that the overriding 
 interest will be prejudiced if the record 
 is not sealed. 
 d. The proposed order to seal the records is narrowly 
 tailored to protect that overriding interest. 
 e. 
 No less restrictive means than sealing the whole record 
 exist to achieve the overriding interest. 
 A petitioner in the confidential
 address program may file an 
 application to file records under seal following the 
 procedures in 
 rule 2. 577 of the California Rules of Court
 . The application must be made on
 the Application to File 
 
 Documents Under
 Seal in Name Change Proceeding
 Under 
 Addres
 s Confidentiality Program 
 (Safe at Home
 ) (form 
 NC 410) and be accompanied by a 
 Declaration in Support 
 of Application to File Documents Under
 Seal in Name 
 Change Proceeding
 Under Address Confidentiality 
 Program (Safe at Home) 
 (form NC
 -420) , containing fact
 s sufficient to justify the sealing. 
 Attach a 
 Confidential Cover Sheet 
 (form NC
 -400) to the 
 application. All the documents that 
 you
 want filed under 
 seal must be put in a sealed envelope, with a completed 
 
 Confidential Cover Sheet 
 (form NC
 -400) on top mar
 ked 
 ﬁConditionally Under Seal
 . ﬂ and lodged with the court. If 
 the application is denied, the documents will be returned by 
 the clerk unless 
 you file
 written notice within 10 days that 
 they should be filed unsealed
 . Even if the documents are not seal
 ed, 
 as long as
 the other 
 requirements are met
 , your name 
 will remain confidential 
 UNLESS
 : a. 
 Your
 participation in the address 
 confidentiality
 program
 is ended under Government Code section 
 6206. 7; or
 b. The court finds by clear and convincing 
 eviden
 ce that 
 the allegations of domestic violence or stalking in the 
 petition
 are false (see Code of Civil Procedure section 
 1278 (b) . ) 
 If an
 other person 
 or a court wants to make the records 
 public based on the above, the court must hold a hearing, 
 with notice s
 ent to the petitioner in care of the Safe 
 at Home 
 program, as permitted 
 under
 Government Code section 
 6206 (a) (5) (A)

 9 10 11 12 Local courts may supplement th
 ese instructions. For 
 instance, the court may provide you with additional 
 written information identifying the department that 
 handles name change petitions and the times when 
 petitions are heard. Check with the court to determine 
 whether supplemental infor
 mation is available.
