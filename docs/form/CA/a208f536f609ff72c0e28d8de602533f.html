Whose Name May Be Changed 

he petition may be used to change one’s own name and, 

under certain circumstances, the names of others (e.g., 
children under 18 years of age). There are no filing fees for 
minors in the Safe at Home program. 

6 

Name Changes for Children 

 petitioner in the confidential address program must 

comply with all the rules stated in item 8 in the Instructions 
on the back of the Petition for Change of Name, concerning 
serving notice of a name change petition for a child on the 
child’s parents or grandparents. The confidentiality 
provisions do not change those requirements. You will 
generally not be able to change a child’s name without 
notifying the other parent. 

7 

What Forms Are Required 

repare an original and two copies of the forms described in 

item 4 of the Instructions on the back of the Petition for 
Change of Name (form NC-100). In addition: 
  
a.  In the Petition for Change of Name (form NC-100), 

Order to Show Cause for Change of Name (form NC-
120), and Decree Changing Name (form NC-130), 
include your present name where indicated.  Instead of 
including the proposed new name, indicate that the new 
name is confidential and on file with the Secretary of 
State’s Safe at Home program.  

 

 

b.  In the Attachment to the Petition for Change of Name 
(form NC-110), include the reasons for seeking the 
name change. 

c.  Prepare and attach to the front of each document a 

Confidential Cover Sheet—Name Change Proceeding 
Under Address Confidentiality Program (Safe at Home) 
(form NC-400).  Do not include the petitioner’s current 
name on these forms. These forms will flag the 
documents as containing confidential information. 
ou will also need a copy of the letter from the Safe at 

Home program to take to the court when filing the petition, 
to confirm that you are in the confidential address program 
and have a Notice of Intent of Name Change on file. Keep a 
copy of that letter for your records.

Confidentiality in Name Change 
Proceedings 

t is important that you understand that changing your 
name, especially confidentially, is a life-changing decision. 
It may make it more difficult for you to enforce a 
restraining order and significantly impair your ability to 
obtain a passport, apply for school programs, purchase or 
rent property, gain employment, get credit, start a business, 
and other matters.  

The law provides confidentiality for a petitioner seeking a 
name change who is a participant in the Secretary of State’s 
confidential address program, Safe at Home, under 
Government Code section 6205 et seq., and who asserts 
reasons for a name change that include seeking (1) to avoid 
domestic violence, (2) to avoid stalking, (3) to avoid sexual 
assault, or (4) to avoid human trafficking. (One of these 
reasons must be stated in the papers filed with the Petition 
for Change of Name.)  

By law, the court must keep the current legal name of such 
a petitioner confidential. The court must not publish or post 
the name in the court’s calendars, indexes, or registers of 
actions, or in any other place in which it might be 
accessible to the public. In addition, the proposed new name 
is not put into the court records at all and does not have to 
be published. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277(b).)  

To ensure this confidentiality for the name change 
proceeding, petitioners must follow the instructions below.  

Is a Lawyer Necessary? 
 

ou are not required to have a lawyer, but it is highly 

advisable that you contact a lawyer or legal service agency 
to discuss the effects of a confidential name change.

How to Get Started 
 

change, you must be an active participant in the Safe at 
Home program. You must complete and file a Notice of 
Intent of Name Change with the Safe at Home program at 
the Secretary of State’s Office. You will receive a letter 
from that program to show to the court, confirming that the 
you are an active participant in the confidential address 
program and that a Notice of Intent of Name Change is on 
file. You can reach the Safe at Home program by calling 
toll free 1-877-322-5227 or by going to the Web site at

c.    A substantial probability exists that the overriding 

interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed.  

d.   The proposed order to seal the records is narrowly 

tailored to protect that overriding interest.  

e.   No less restrictive means than sealing the whole record 

exist to achieve the overriding interest.  

 petitioner in the confidential address program may file an 

application to file records under seal following the 
procedures in rule 2.577 of the California Rules of Court. 
The application must be made on the Application to File 
Documents Under Seal in Name Change Proceeding Under 
Address Confidentiality Program (Safe at Home) (form  
NC-410) and be accompanied by a Declaration in Support 
of Application to File Documents Under Seal in Name 
Change Proceeding Under Address Confidentiality 
Program (Safe at Home) (form NC-420), containing facts 
sufficient to justify the sealing.  

ttach a Confidential Cover Sheet (form NC-400) to the 
application. All the documents that you want filed under 
seal must be put in a sealed envelope, with a completed 
Confidential Cover Sheet (form NC-400) on top marked 
“Conditionally Under Seal.” and lodged with the court. If 
the application is denied, the documents will be returned by 
the clerk unless you file written notice within 10 days that 
they should be filed unsealed.

Making the Records Public 
 

ven if the documents are not sealed, as long as the other 
requirements are met, your name will remain confidential 
UNLESS: 

.   Your participation in the address confidentiality 

program is ended under Government Code section 
6206.7; or 

.   The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that 
the allegations of domestic violence or stalking in the 
petition are false (see Code of Civil Procedure section 
1278(b).) 

If another person or a court wants to make the records 
public based on the above, the court must hold a hearing, 
with notice sent to the petitioner in care of the Safe at Home 
program, as permitted under Government Code section 
6206(a)(5)(A).

Local courts may supplement these instructions. For 
instance, the court may provide you with additional 
written information identifying the department that 
handles name change petitions and the times when 
Code of Civil Procedure, § 1277, 1278; 
Cal. Rules of Court, rules 2.575, 2.577

your petition, and any other document you file under that 
item.

Requesting a Court Hearing Date and 
Obtaining the Order to Show Cause 
ou should request a date for the hearing on the Order to 
Show Cause For Change of Name at least six weeks after 
the date you file the petition. Take the completed form to 
the clerk’s office. The clerk will provide the hearing date 
and location, obtain the judicial officer’s signature, file the 
original, and give you a copy.  

10 

 

No Requirement to Publish the Order 
to Show Cause 

n most cases, the Order to Show Cause must be published 
in a local newspaper of general circulation. But a petitioner 
does not have to publish the order if he or she is a 
participant in the address confidentiality program and the 
petition alleges that he or she (1) is petitioning to avoid 
domestic violence, (2) is petitioning to avoid stalking, or  
(3) is, or is filing on behalf of, a victim of sexual assault.  

 
11 

 

Court Hearing 
 

f no written objection is filed at least two court days before 
the hearing, the court may grant the petition without a 
hearing. Check with the court to find out if a hearing will be 
held. If there is a hearing, bring copies of all documents to 
the hearing. If the judge grants the petition, the judge will 
sign the original decree.  

12 

Application to File Documents Under 
Seal 
 

f a petitioner in the confidential address program believes 
that the protections described above and required by law 
that keeping the current and future name confidential are 
not sufficient in a particular case, the petitioner may ask the 
court to file the petition and related documents under seal. 
Documents filed under seal are secured and kept separate 
from the public files.  

or the court to order that the petition may be filed under 
seal, you must show facts to support the following findings 
by the court:  

.   There is an overriding interest that overcomes the right 

of public access to the record.  

b.   That overriding interest supports sealing the name    

change documents.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
