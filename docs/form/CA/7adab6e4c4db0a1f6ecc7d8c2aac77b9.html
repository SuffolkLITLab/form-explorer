FORM INTERROGATORIES – EMPLOYMENT LAW

CASE NUMBER:

Sec. 1. Instructions to All Parties 
(a)

Interrogatories are written questions prepared by a party to an 
action that are sent to any other party in the action to be 
answered under oath. The interrogatories below are form 
interrogatories approved for use in employment cases.

(d)

(b) For time limitations, requirements for service on other parties, 
and other details, see Code of Civil Procedure sections  
2030.010–2030.410 and the cases construing those sections.

(c) These form interrogatories do not change existing law relating 
to interrogatories nor do they affect an answering party’s right 
to assert any privilege or make any objection.

Sec. 2. Instructions to the Asking Party
(a) These form interrogatories are designed for optional use by 

parties in employment cases. (Separate sets of  
interrogatories, Form Interrogatories—General (form  
DISC-001) and Form Interrogatories—Limited Civil Cases  
(Economic Litigation) (form DISC-004) may also be used 
where applicable in employment cases.)
Insert the names of the EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER to 
whom these interrogatories apply in the definitions in sections 
4(d) and (e) below.

(c) Check the box next to each interrogatory that you want the  
answering party to answer. Use care in choosing those 
interrogatories that are applicable to the case.

(d) The interrogatories in section 211.0, Loss of

conduct an investigation or discovery of the employee’s

Procedure sections 2030.260–2030.270 for details.

(c) Each answer must be as complete and straightforward  

as the information reasonably available to you permits. If  
an interrogatory cannot be answered completely,  
answer it to the extent possible.
If you do not have enough personal knowledge to fully 
answer an interrogatory, say so, but make a reasonable  
and good faith effort to get the information by asking  
other persons or organizations, unless the information is 
equally available to the asking party.

(e) Whenever an interrogatory may be answered by  

referring to a document, the document may be attached  
as an exhibit to the response and referred to in the  
response. If the document has more than one page,  
refer to the page and section where the answer to the 
interrogatory can be found.

(f) Whenever an address and telephone number for the  

same person are requested in more than one  
interrogatory, you are required to furnish them in  
answering only the first interrogatory asking for that 
information.

(g)

If you are asserting a privilege or making an objection to  
an interrogatory, you must specifically assert the  
privilege or state the objection in your written response.

(h) Your answers to these interrogatories must be verified,  

dated, and signed. You may wish to use the following  
form at the end of your answers:
