Instructions to the Asking Party I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing answers are true and correct. Additional interrogatories may be attached. Sec. 3. Instructions to the Answering Party Page 1 of 8 Sec. 1. Instructions to All Parties Interrogatories are written questions prepared by a party to an 
 action that are sent to any other party in the action to be 
 answered under oath. The interrogatories below are form 
 interrogatories approved for use in employment cases. For time limitations, requirements for service on other parties, and other details, see Code of Civil Procedure sections 
 2030. 010Œ2030. 410 and the cases construing those sections. (b) These form interrogatories do not change existing law relating 
 to interrogatories nor do they affect an answering party™s right 
 to assert any privilege or make any objection. (c) These form interrogatories are designed for optional use by 
 parties in employment cases. (Separate sets of interrogatories, Form InterrogatoriesŠGeneral (form DISC 001) and Form InterrogatoriesŠLimited Civil Cases (Economic Litigation) (form DISC 004) may also be used where applicable in employment cases. ) Insert the names of the EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYER to whom these interrogatories apply in the definitions in sections 4 (d) and (e) below. Check the box next to each interrogatory that you want the answering party to answer. Use care in choosing those 
 interrogatories that are applicable to the case. The interrogatories in section 211. 0, Loss of Income Interrogatories to Employer, should not be used until the employer has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an investigation or discovery of the employee™s injuries and 
 damages. You must answer or provide another appropriate response to each interrogatory that has been checked below. As a general rule, within 30 days after you are served with these interrogatories, you must serve your responses on the 
 asking party and serve copies of your responses on all other 
 parties to the action who have appeared. See Code of Civil 
 Procedure sections 2030. 260Œ2030. 270 for details. Each answer must be as complete and straightforward as the 
 information reasonably available to you permits. If an 
 interrogatory cannot be answered completely, answer it to the 
 extent possible. If you do not have enough personal knowledge to fully answer 
 an interrogatory, say so, but make a reasonable and good 
 faith effort to get the information by asking other persons or 
 organizations, unless the information is equally available to 
 the asking party. Whenever an interrogatory may be answered by referring to a 
 document, the document may be attached as an exhibit to the 
 response and referred to in the response. If the document has 
 more than one page, refer to the page and section where the 
 answer to the interrogatory can be found. Whenever an address and telephone number for the same person are requested in more than one interrogatory, you are required to furnish them in answering only the first 
 interrogatory asking for that information. If you are asserting a privilege or making an objection to an interrogatory, you must specifically assert the privilege or 
 state the objection in your written response. Your answers to these interrogatories must be verified, dated, and signed. You may wish to use the following form at the end 
 of your answers: Sec. 4. Definitions Words in BOLDFACE CAPITALS in these interrogatories are defined as follows: PERSON includes a natural person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business, trust, limited liability company, corporation, or public entity.
