INSTRUCTIONS TO EMPLOYER ON 
EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS 

WG-030

The instructions in paragraph 1 on the reverse of this form describe your 
early  duties  to  provide  information  to  your  employee  and  the  levying 
officer.
Your  other  duties  are  TO  WITHHOLD  THE  CORRECT  AMOUNT  OF 
EARNINGS (if any) and PAY IT TO THE LEVYING OFFICER during the 
withholding period.

The  withholding  period  is  the  period  covered  by  the  Earnings  With- 
holding Order (this order). The withholding period begins 10 calendar days 
after you receive the order and continues until the total amount due, plus 
additional amounts for costs and interest (which will be listed in a levying 
officer's notice), is withheld.
It  may  end  sooner  if  (1)  you  receive  a  written  notice  signed  by  the 
levying  officer  specifying  an  earlier  termination  date,  or  (2)  an  order  of 
higher  priority  (explained  on  the  reverse  of  the  Employer's  Return  (form 
WG-005)) is received.
You are entitled to rely on and must obey all written notices signed by  the 
levying officer.
The  Employer's  Return  (form  WG-005)  describes  several  situations  that 
could affect the withholding period for this order.  If you receive more than 
one  Earnings  Withholding  Order  during  a  withholding  period,  review  that 
form (Employer's Return) for instructions.
If  the  employee  stops  working  for  you,  the  Earnings  Withholding  Order 
ends  after  no  amounts  are  withheld  for  a  continuous  180-day  period.  If 
withholding  ends  because  the  earnings  are  subject  to  an  order  of  higher 
priority, the Earnings Withholding Order ends after a continuous two-year 
period during which no amounts are withheld under the order. Return the 
Earnings Withholding Order to the levying officer with a statement of 
the reason it is being returned.

WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY
The  amounts  withheld  during  the  withholding  period  must  be  paid  to  the 
levying officer by the 15th of the next month after each payday. If you wish 
to pay more frequently than monthly, each payment must be made within 
10 days after the close of the pay period.

Be sure to mark each check with the case number, the levying officer's file 
number,  if  different,  and  the  employee's  name  so  the  money  will  be 
applied to the correct account.

WHAT IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS?
The  garnishment  law  is  contained  in  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure 
beginning with section 706.010. Sections 706.022, 706.025, 706.050, and 
706.104 explain the employer's duties.
The  Federal  Wage  Garnishment  Law  and  federal  rules  provide  the  basic 
protections  on  which  the  California  law  is  based.  Inquiries  about  the 
federal  law  will  be  answered  by  mail,  telephone,  or  personal  interview  at 
any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. 
Offices are listed in the telephone directory under the U.S. Department of 
Labor in the U.S. Government listing.

COMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS

California law provides how much earnings to withhold, if any, for different 
amounts of disposable earnings and different pay periods, and takes into 
consideration different minimum wage amounts. The method of calculation 
is  at  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  section  706.050,  and  is  described  in  the 
column to the right. You may also look on the California Courts Self-Help 
website  for  assistance  in  determining  the  maximum  withholding  amounts 
for different amounts of disposable income, for different pay periods, with 
different  minimum  wage  amounts.  The  information  is  at  www.courts.ca.
gov/self-help-employerwagecivil.htm. 

THESE COMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS APPLY UNDER NORMAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY  DO NOT APPLY TO ORDERS FOR THE 
SUPPORT OF A SPOUSE, FORMER SPOUSE, OR CHILD. 

State  law  limits  the  amount  of  earnings  that  can  be  withheld.  The 
limitations  are  based  on  the  employee's  disposable  earnings,  which  are 
different from gross pay or take-home pay.

(A) To determine the CORRECT AMOUNT OF EARNINGS TO BE WITH- 
HELD (if any), first compute the employee's disposable earnings.
Earnings 
(whether  called  wages,  salary, 
commissions, bonuses, or anything else) that is paid by an employer to  an 
employee  for  personal  services.  Vacation  or  sick  pay  is  subject  to 
withholding  as  it  is  received  by  the  employee.  Tips  are  generally  not 
included as earnings because they are not paid by the employer.

include  any  money 

Disposable earnings are the earnings left after subtracting the part of the 
earnings a state or federal law requires an employer to withhold. Generally 
these  required  deductions  are  (1)  federal  income  tax,  (2)  federal  social 
security, (3) state income tax, (4) state disability insurance, and  
(5) payments to public employee retirement systems. Disposable earnings 
will change when the required deductions change.

(B)  After  the  employee's  disposable  earnings  are  known,  to  determine 
what  amount  should  be  withheld,  you  may  look  to  the  statute,  follow  the 
directions  below  in  (C),  or  seek  assistance  on  the  California  Courts  Self-
Help  website  at  www.courts.ca.gov/self-help-employerwagecivil.htm. 
Note that you will also need to know the amount of the minimum wage in 
the location where the employee works. 

(C)  Calculate  the  maximum  amount  that  may  be  withheld  from  the 
employee's  disposable  earnings,  which  is  the  lesser  of  the  following  two 
amounts: 

•  25 percent of disposable earnings for that week; or 
•  50  percent  of  the  amount  by  which  the  employee's  disposable 
earnings that week exceed the applicable minimum wage. If there is a 
local minimum wage in effect in the location where the employee works 
that  exceeds  the  state  minimum  wage  at  the  time  the  earnings  are 
payable, the local minimum wage is the applicable minimum wage 

To calculate the correct amount, follow the steps below: 
Step 1: Determine the applicable minimum wage per pay period. 

•  For a daily or weekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly 

minimum wage by 40. 

wage by 80. 

•  For a biweekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum 

•  For a semimonthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly 

minimum wage by 86 2/3. 

•  For a monthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum 

wage by 173 1/3. 

Step 2: Subtract the amount from Step 1 from the employee's disposable 
earnings during that pay period. 
Step  3:  If  the  amount  from  Step  2  is  less  than  zero,  do  not  withhold  any 
money from the employee's earnings. 
Step  4:  If  the  amount  from  Step  2  is  greater  than  zero,  multiply  that 
amount by one-half. 
Step  5:  If  the  amount  from  Step  4  is  lower  than  25  percent  of  the 
employee's disposable earnings, withhold this amount. If it is greater than 
25 percent of the employee's disposable earnings, withhold 25 percent of 
the disposable earnings.

Occasionally,  the  employee's  earnings  will  also  be  subject  to  a  Wage 
and  Earnings  Assignment  Order,  an  order  available  from  family  law 
courts  for  child,  spousal,  or  family  support.  The  amount  required  to  be 
withheld  for  that  order  should  be  deducted  from  the  amount  to  be 
withheld for this order.

IMPORTANT WARNINGS
IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO FIRE THE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS FOR THE PAYMENT OF ONLY ONE 
INDEBTEDNESS.  No matter how many orders you receive, so long as they all relate to a single indebtedness  (no matter how many debts are 
represented in that judgment), the employee may not be fired.
IT IS ILLEGAL TO AVOID AN EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER BY POSTPONING OR ADVANCING THE PAYMENT OF EARNINGS. The 
employee's pay period must not be changed to prevent the order from taking effect.
IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO PAY AMOUNTS WITHHELD FOR THE EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER TO THE LEVYING OFFICER. Your duty is 
to pay the money to the levying officer who will pay the money in accordance with the law that applies to this case.
