INFORMATION SHEET FOR CHILD SUPPORT CASE REGISTRY FORM 
(Do NOT deliver this Information Sheet to the court clerk.)

Please follow these instructions to complete the Child Support Case Registry Form (form FL-191) if you do not have an attorney to 
represent you. Your attorney, if you have one, should complete this form.

Both parents must complete a Child Support Case Registry Form. The information on this form will be included in a national database 
that, among other things, is used to locate absent parents. When you file a court order, you must deliver a completed form to the court 
clerk along with your court order. If you did not file a court order, you must deliver a completed form to the court clerk WITHIN 10 DAYS 
of the date you received a copy of your court order. If any of the information you provide on this form changes, you must complete a 
new form and deliver it to the court clerk within 10 days of the change. The address of the court clerk is the same as the one shown for 
the superior court on your order. This form is confidential and will not be filed in the court file. It will be maintained in a confidential file 
with the State of California.  

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE CHILD SUPPORT CASE REGISTRY FORM (TYPE OR PRINT IN INK):

If the top section of the form has already been filled out, skip down to number 1 below. If the top section of the form is blank, you must 
provide this information.

Page 1, first box, top of form, left side: Print your name, address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address, if any, in this box. 
Attorneys must include their State Bar identification numbers.

Page 1, second box, top of form, left side: Print the name of the county and the court’s address in this box. Use the same address for 
the court that is on the court order you are filing or have received.

Page 1, third box, top of form, left side: Print the names of the petitioner/plaintiff, respondent/defendant, and other parent in this box. 
Use the same names listed on the court order you are filing or have received.

Page 1, fourth box, top of form, left side: Check the box indicating whether you are the mother or the father.  If you are the attorney for 
the mother, check the box for mother. If you are the attorney for the father, check the box for father. Also, if this is the first time you 
have filled out this form, check the box by "First form completed.” If you have filled out form FL-191 before, and you are changing any of 
the information, check the box by “Change to previous information.”

Page 1, first box,  right side: Leave this box blank for the court’s use in stamping the date of receipt.

Page 1, second box, right side: Print the court case number in this box. This number is also shown on the court papers.

Instructions for numbered paragraphs:

1.  a. Enter the date the court order was filed. This date is shown in the “COURT PERSONNEL: STAMP DATE RECEIVED HERE" box 

on page 1 at the top of the order on the right side. If the order has not been filed, leave this item blank for the court clerk to fill in.

b. If the court order you filed or received is the first child or family support order for this case, check the box by “Initial child support  

or family support order." If this is a change to your order, check the box by “Modification.”

c. Information regarding the amount and type of support ordered and wage withholding is on the court order you are filing or have 

received.

(1)

(2)

If your order provides for any type of current support, check all boxes that describe that support. For example, if your order 
provides for both child and spousal support, check both of those boxes. If there is an amount, put it in the blank provided. If 
the order says the amount is reserved, check the “Reserved order” box. If the order says the amount is zero, check the “$0 
(zero) order" box. Do not include child care, special needs, uninsured medical expenses, or travel for visitation here. These 
amounts will go in (2).  Do NOT complete the Child Support Case Registry form if you receive spousal support only.

If your order provides for a set monthly amount to be paid as additional support for such needs as child care, special needs, 
uninsured medical expenses or travel for visitation check the box in Item 2 and enter the monthly amount. For example, if 
your order provides for base child support and in addition the paying parent is required to pay $300 per month, check the 
box in item 2 underneath the "Child Support" column and enter $300. Do NOT check this box if your order provides only for 
a payment of a percentage, such as 50% of the childcare. 

FL-191 [Rev. July 1, 2005]

CHILD SUPPORT CASE REGISTRY FORM

Page 3 of 4

(3) If your order determined the amount of past due support, check the box in Item 3 that states the type of past due support and 
enter the amount. For example, if the court determined that there was $5000 in past due child support and $1000 in past due 
spousal support, you would check the box in item 3 in the "Child Support" column and enter $5000 and you would also check 
the box in item 3 in the "Spousal Support" column and enter $1000.

(4) If your order provides for a specific dollar amount to be paid towards any past due support, check the box in Item 4 that states 
the type of past due support and enter the amount. For example, the court ordered $350 per month to be paid on the past due 
child support, you would check the box in Item 4 in the "Child Support" column and enter $350.

(5) Check the "ordered" box if wage withholding was ordered with no conditions. Check the box "ordered but stayed until" if wage 

withholding was ordered but is not to be deducted until a later date. If the court delayed the effective date of the wage 
withholding, enter the specific date. Check only one box in this item. 

2.  a. Write the name of the person who is supposed to pay child or family support. 

b. Write the relationship of that person to the child.

3.  a. Write the name of the person or agency supposed to receive child or family support payments. 

b. Write the relationship of that person to the child.

4.  List the full name, date of birth, and social security number for each child included in the support order. If there are more than five 
children included in the support order, check the box below item 4e and list the remaining children with dates of birth and social 
security numbers on another sheet of paper. Attach the other sheet to this form.

The local child support agency is required, under section 466(a)(13) of the Social Security Act, to place in the records pertaining to child 
support the social security number of any individual who is subject to a divorce decree, support order, or paternity determination or 
acknowledgment.  This information is mandatory and will be kept on file at the local child support agency.

Top of page 2, box on left side: Print the names of the petitioner/plaintiff, respondent/defendant, and other parent in this box. Use the 
same names listed on page 1.

Top of page 2, box on right side: Print your court case number in this box. Use the same case number as on page 1, second box, right 
side.

You are required to complete information about yourself. If you know information about the other person, you may also fill in what you 
know about him or her.

5.

7.

a. Check the box beside each person who is protected by the restraining order.  

b. Check the box beside the parent who is restrained.

c. Write the date the restraining order expires. See the restraining order, protective order, or nondisclosure order for this date.

sign under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the information you have provided is true and correct.
