      <pre>How do I have my court papers served? 

Step 1: Choose a server 

The person who gives your court papers to the other 
party is called a server. Your server must be at least 
18-years-old. They must not be protected by the 
restraining order or involved in your case. This 
means that you cannot serve your own court papers. 

Step 2: Have your server give your court papers 
to the other party 

Give your server these instructions: 


Before you serve the forms, note which forms 
you have, including the name of the form and  
the form number. See form DV-200 for a list  
of forms. 

Find the person you need to serve. Make sure  
you are serving the right person by asking the 
person's name. 

Give the person the papers. If the person refuses 
to take the papers, put them on the ground or 
somewhere next to the person. The person  
doesn't have to touch or sign for the papers.  
It is okay if they tear them up. 

Fill out form DV-200 completely and sign. 

File form DV-200 with the court or give form 
DV-200 to the person who is asking for the 
restraining order so they can file it. 

 



Step 3: File proof with the court 

The court needs proof that service happened and  
that it was done correctly. If your server was 
successful, have your server fully complete and sign 
form DV-200. The person you want restrained 
does not sign anything. 

Take form DV-200 to the court to file in your case as
soon as possible. This information will automatically
go into a restraining order database that police have 
access to.  

If the sheriff or marshal served your court papers, 
they may use another form for proof besides form 
DV-200. Make sure a copy is filed with the court 
and that you get a copy.

What is "service"? 
Service is the act of giving your court papers to the other
party in your case. There are different ways to serve the 
other party: in person, by mail, and others. 

Why do I have to serve my legal papers?
Before a judge can grant a domestic violence restraining 
order (that can last up to five years), the person you 
want a restraining order against must know about your 
request and have a chance to go to court to explain their 
side. Also, if a restraining order is in place, the police 
cannot arrest the restrained person for violating the 
restraining order until the restrained person is served 
with the order. 

        What is "personal service"? 
           Personal service is when someone,  
           known as a server, personally delivers  
           your court papers to the other party. 

In most cases, these forms must be served to the other 
party by personal service: 

Form DV-109; 

Form DV-100; 

Form DV-110; 

Form DV-120 (leave this form blank); 

Form DV-120-INFO; and 

Form DV-250 (leave this form blank). 

 
 
 
 

  

  

Who can serve? 
Any adult who is not protected by the restraining order 
can serve your court papers. You cannot serve your 
own court papers. 

Some situations may be dangerous. Think about 
people's safety when deciding who you want to  
serve your papers. 

A sheriff or marshal will serve your court papers for 
free. A registered process server is a business you pay to 
deliver papers. To hire a process server, look for 
"process server" on the internet or in the yellow pages.

What happens if I can't get my court 
papers served before the court date? 
You will need to ask the court to reschedule (continue) 
your court date. Fill out and file form DV-115 and form 
DV-116. These forms ask the judge for a new court date 
and to make any temporary orders last until the end of 
the new court date.  

If the judge gives you a new court date, the person you 
want restrained will have to be served with form 
DV-116, form DV-115, and the original papers you 
filed. You should keep a copy of form DV-115, form 
DV-116, and a copy of your original paperwork. That 
way, the police will know your orders are still in effect.  

For more information on asking for a new court date, 
read form DV-115-INFO. 

What if the other party is  
avoiding (evading) service? 
If you've tried many times to serve the the restrained 
person, and you can show the judge that the restrained 
person is avoiding (evading) service, you may ask the 
court to allow you to serve another way. If you want  
to make this request, at your first court date tell the 
judge details about your attempts to have the restrained 
person served. The judge may require a written 
statement for this.  

Read form DV-205-INFO, What if the Person I Want 
Protection From is Avoiding (Evading) Service?, for 
more information. 

When is the deadline to serve my  
court papers? 
It depends. To know the exact date, you need to look at 
two items on form DV-109. Follow these steps: 

Step 1: Look at the court date listed under       
on page 1.

tep 3: Look at a calendar. Subtract the number of 
days in       from the court date. That's the deadline to
have your court papers served. It's okay to serve your
court papers before the deadline.

If nothing is written in      , you must have your  
court papers served at least five days before your 
court date.
