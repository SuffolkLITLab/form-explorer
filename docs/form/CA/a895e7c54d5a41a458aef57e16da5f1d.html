January 1, 2021, Optional Form How to Adopt a Child in California ADOPT 050 INFO, Page 1 of 4 ADOPT 050 INFOHow to Adopt a Child in California Seek legal advice about your family™s options before beginning any adoption. Every family is different and adoption 
 may not be necessary for some families. Visit the California Court™s Online Self Help Center adoption page to get copies 
 of adoption forms, look for organizations that provide legal help with adoptions, and learn how to complete the adoption 
 process on your own if you do not have a lawyer: You can also get copies of adoption forms at your local court clerk™s office. General Information on Adoptions In California there are several kinds of adoption. This information sheet provides steps for the following types: Ł Independent or agency adoptions in the United States Ł Stepparent/domestic partner adoptions ŁIntercountry adoptions Ł Stepparent/domestic partner confirmation of parentage Page 4 also has information about open adoptions and special requirements for the adoption of Indian (Native American) 
 children. Stepparent/Domestic Partner Adoptions If you wish to adopt the child of your spouse or domestic partner, you may be eligible for a stepparent adoption. There are 
 two types of stepparent adoptions. Answer these questions to figure out which process is right for you: Were you in a union with the child™s legal parent at the time the child was born and are you still in a union with the legal parent? (A ﬁunionﬂ means a marriage, a California registered domestic partnership, or a registered domestic partnership or civil union from another state that is legally equivalent to a marriage. ) Did your spouse or domestic partner give birth to the child or was the child born through a gestational surrogacy process brought about by one or both of you? If you answered ﬁNoﬂ to either question, complete items 1 through 4 below for a stepparent/domestic partner adoption. If you answered ﬁYesﬂ to both questions, complete items 1 and 2, only, for a stepparent adoption to confirm parentage. 1 Fill out court forms ADOPT 200 Adoption Request This tells the judge about you and the child you are adopting.

 sign it. ADOPT 215 Adoption Order The judge signs this form if your adoption is approved. ICWA 010 (A) Indian Child Inquiry 
 Attachment This lets the judge know that you have asked whether the child may 
 be an Indian child. ICWA 020 Parental Notification 
 of Indian Status One form is required for each birth parent. This shows that the 
 child™s parents have been asked about potential Indian status. ADOPT 205 (or 
 an equivalent 
 declaration) Declaration 
 Confirming Parentage 
 in Stepparent 
 Adoption This tells the court how you conceived your child and whether there 
 are any other parents. Only use this if you are seeking a stepparent 
 adoption to confirm parentage. See above for more information on 
 this type of adoption. Both the birth parent and the adopting parent 
 must complete a separate declaration. -OR ADOPT 206 (or 
 an equivalent 
 declaration) Declaration 
 Confirming Parentage 
 in Stepparent 
 Adoption: Gestational 
 Surrogacy This tells the court how you conceived your child and whether there 
 are any other parents. Only use this if you are seeking a stepparent 
 adoption to confirm parentage because the child was conceived 
 through a gestational surrogate and was born outside of California,

 parent to be named as a legal parent on the child™s birth certificate. Additional Forms for Stepparent Adoption to Confirm Parentage How to Adopt a Child in California Rev.
