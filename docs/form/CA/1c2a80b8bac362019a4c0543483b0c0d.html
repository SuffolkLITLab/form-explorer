 Juvenile justice
 court (sometimes called
 delinquency
 court) is a
 court 
 that decides if a 
 child
 broke
 the law. The juvenile 
 justice 
 court 
 helps to protect, guide, and 
 rehabilitate
 children. 
 And
 it helps keep the community safe. 
 This information sheet
 answers common questions tha
 t many parents have. 
 It has
 three
 sections: 
 1. What 
 Happens When Your Child I
 s Arrested
 2. Juvenile Court Hearings and Orders 
 3. How to Keep Your Child™s Juvenile Court 
 Record Private
 This 
 form
 describe
 s the 
 juvenile justice 
 court process. Some children who 
 break
 the law 
 and become involved with law 
 enforcement or probation never 
 need to go to court. 
 1
 What Happens When Your Ch
 ild 
 Is Arrested
 This section
 is about: 
 What to expect when your 
 child is arrested, 
 What y
 our child™s legal rights
 are
 , 
 What t
 he 
 notice 
 to appear
 and the 
 petition
 are
 , 
 What it means
 to transfer your child to adult court, and 
 What a 
 probation officer
 does. 
 My child was arrested. What happens next? 
 Your child 
 might
 be brought home or 
 allowed to go
 home with you. 
 You will be given or 
 mailed
 a notice to 
 appear 
 that 
 tells you
 the date, time, and place you and your child need to 
 go 
 to the 
 probation 
 department 
 or 
 juvenile 
 court. 
 Talk to a qualified juvenile defense lawyer about your child™s case. Many juvenile 
 defenders offer free consultations. 
 Warning! 
 You and your child 
 must
 go to the meeting listed on the notice 
 to appear 
 even if no one contacts you 
 again
 . Sometimes the meeting 
 will be
 at 
 probation. 
 Sometimes t
 he notice 
 will
 order you to go to the juvenile court. 
 Your child 
 might
 NOT be sent home 
 immediately 
 after the arrest
 . If that happens, t
 he officer who arrested your child may: 
 Let your child go 
 later. 
 Take your child to juvenile hall and keep them there
 . This is called 
 in custody detention. 
 If this happens, the arresting 
 officer 
 must
 try to contact you immediately to 
 tell you where your child is and 
 that
 your child is in custody. 
 What 
 are my child™s legal rights after arrest
 ? 
 Your child 
 has the right to make at least
 
 two
 phone calls 
 within 
 1 hour
 of being arrested. 
 One call must be a 
 completed
 call to a parent, 
 guardian, res
 ponsible 
 relative, or employer. 
 The other call must be a 
 completed
 call to a lawyer. 
 If your child is currently in court-
 ordered foster care, 
 your child may 
 also 
 be allowed to call a foster parent 
 or social worker. 
 Will they tell my child about the right to remain
 
 silent? 
 Yes. Before any officer asks your child about what 
 
 happened, the officer must first tell your child about 
 your 
 child™s 
 Miranda 
 rights. 
 They will say: 
 ﬁYou have the right to remain silent. Anything 
 
 you say will be used against you in court. You 
 have a right to 
 have 
 a lawyer
 with you during 
 questioning. If you or your parents cannot afford 
 a lawyer, 
 one
 will be appointed for you. ﬂ

 NOTE: 
 If your child is 15 years old or younger and in 
 custody, your child 
 must
 talk to a lawyer
 Šin person, by 
 phone, or 
 by videoconference (like Skype or Face Time) 
 Šbefore answering any questions or giving up any rights. 
 Your child cannot decide to answer questions or give up 
 rights without first talking to a lawyer. 
 Does my child need a lawyer? 
 If a petition is filed, your 
 child has a right to a
 n effective
 and 
 prepared
 court
 -appointed lawyer, who must 
 have specific education and training in juvenile 
 justice cases. 
 Many parents hire a lawyer for their 
 child as soon as the child is arrested. 
 Your child™s lawyer represents 
 only 
 your child, not you, 
 even if you 
 are paying for that
 lawyer. 
 Do I
 need a lawyer for myself? 
 The court can order you to do things for your child and 
 can order you to pay 
 restitution
 to the 
 victim. 
 Some 
 parents hire lawyers for legal advice about these issues. 
 NOTE: 
 If you think you need your own lawyer and 
 cannot afford to hire one, you can ask the court to appoint 
 a lawyer for you. The court will decide whether to appoint 
 
 you a lawyer. If it does, you might be ordered to pay b
 ack 
 the cost of the lawyer
 if the court decides you can. 
 If my child is required to meet with 
 probation
 , 
 how can we get ready? 
 It™s a good idea to get legal advice. A defense lawyer
 who 
 specializes in juvenile justice cases
 can help you 
 
 understand your child™s rights and know what to expect. 
 Try to find school records and other information that 
 shows what you and your child are doing to get back on 
 
 track. 
 At the meeting
 , the probation officer 
 will talk with you 
 and your child to figure out the best 
 way to handle your 
 
 child™s case. 
 NOTE: 
 At this meeting, t
 he probation officer must tell 
 you and your child about 
 the
 Miranda 
 rights
 . Any 
 information you or your child share with the probation 
 officer 
 might be shared with the court or the prosecuting 
 attorney (DA) . 
 If the alleged offense is
 not serious or it™s the first time 
 your child has been accused of breaking the law, the 
 probation officer might just tell your child what 
 they
 
 did was wrong (reprimand 
 them
 ) and let your child go. 
 The probation officer might o
 ffer to let your child 
 do 
 a special 
 diversion
 program
 instead of going to court. 
 Each county has different rules and different programs. 
 
 If you and your child agree to the program and your 
 child does everything the program requires, the 
 juvenile court does not need to 
 get
 involved
 . If the offense is more serious, the probation officer 
 might r
 efer your child™s case to the prosecuting 
 attorney (DA) . If the prosecutor decides 
 to file 
 charges, they will file a 
 petition
 in juvenile court
 . That™s what the rest of this form is about. 
 What
 happens if my child is taken to juvenile hall 
 after getting arrested? 
 The probation officer can decide to: 
 Keep your child in custody, or 
 Let your child go home with you. 
 If the 
 officer 
 let
 s 
 your child go, they may still: 
 Ask the DA to file a petition, 
 and 
 Set 
 limit
 s 
 on 
 what your child 
 is allowed to
 do while at 
 home. 
 If the
 officer
 does not
 let your child go, a petition 
 must
 be 
 filed within 48 hours of the arrest. 
 A detention hearing 
 must be held the next day the court is in session. The 
 courts are closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. 
 
 You and your child 
 must
 be given a copy of the petition. 
 Exception: 
 If your child is under 8, 
 your 
 child does not 
 have a righ
 t to get a copy of the 
 petition. 
 How long can they keep my child in juvenile 
 
 hall? 
 The judge will decide at the detention hearing. The judge 
 
 may 
 release your child or 
 keep your child in juvenile hall 
 
 until the next hearing or until the 
 whole case is over
 . 
 Can I visit my child in juvenile hall? 
 Usually, but before you go, c
 ontact the juvenile hall 
 or the 
 probation officer to find out when you can see your child. 
 What if 
 the 
 probation officer says a 
 petition will 
 be filed? 
 The petition 
 state
 s the 
 things your 
 child is accused of
 or 
 charged with. It means your child™s case will be sent to 
 juvenile court. You have the right to receive a copy of the 
 petition. If you have not received a copy of the petition, 
 ask the probation officer or the court clerk for one.

 The 
 petition 
 says your child did something against the law
 and asks the 
 juvenile 
 court to decide 
 that what it says is 
 true, but it does not prove anything. 
 Read the Petition Carefully! 
 It is important to know 
 
 what your child is accused of. 
 Are all petitions the same? 
 No. Each petition is tailored to the child and 
 the 
 alleged 
 offense. 
 There are 
 two
 kinds of petitions: 
 A 601 Petition
 is 
 filed
 when a child has: 
 Run 
 away, 
 Skipped school 
 a lot
 , 
 Violated a
 curfew, or 
 Regularly disobeyed
 a parent
 or guardian. 
 These 
 petitions are filed by the probation department at 
 
 the juvenile court. If the court decides the charges are 
 
 true, 
 your child can become a ﬁwardﬂ of the court. That 
 means the court will supervise your child, and your child 
 must obey the court™s orders. 
 A 602 Petition
 is for a charge that would be a 
 misdemeanor
 (like 
 shoplifting or simple assault
 ) or 
 felony 
 (like 
 stealing a car
 , selling drugs, rape, or murder) if an 
 adult 
 had done it. 
 These 
 petitions are filed by the prosecuting attorney 
 (DA) . If the court 
 decides the charges are true, the judge 
 
 can: 
 Order your child put on probation, 
 Make your child a ﬁwardﬂ of the court, and
 Order 
 your child placed out of your home or 
 
 committed (locked up) . 
 NOTE: 
 If your family is involved with the child welfare 
 system, 
 talk with your lawyer about what your child™s 
 arrest means for that case. Depending on everything that 
 has happened, the court might decide that it™s best for 
 
 your child to stay in the child welfare system, to be 
 supervised in the juvenile justice system, 
 or to be 
 supervised and served in both systems. 
 Can my child™s case
 be moved to adult court? 
 In certain situations, t
 he prosecuting attorney (DA) can 
 ask the juvenile court to transfer your child
 ™s case
 to adult 
 criminal 
 court
 . If that happens, talk to you
 r child™s lawyer 
 right away. Adult criminal cases are handled very 
 differently and there may be very serious consequences 
 for your child. 
 A case can only be transfer
 red to adult court
 if your child is: 
 14 years old 
 or older, and 
 Charged with a very serious
 or violent offense
 , such as: 
 o Murder and attempted murder; 
 o Setting a building on fire when there is someone 
 
 inside (arson) 
 ; 
 o Robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon; 
 o Some rape, kidnapping, and carjacking cases
 ; 
 o Some firearms and drug offenses; 
 and
 o Some 
 violent escapes from a juvenile detention 
 facility
 . What does the probation officer 
 do? 
 Probation officers investigate children™s situations and 
 backgrounds and write reports for the court. They also 
 supervise children to see if they are doing what the cou
 rt 
 has ordered 
 them to do. 
 Why does the probation officer write a report? 
 The probation officer writes reports to give the court 
 information about your child. The reports 
 give
 the judge a
 description of your child™s situation, including life at 
 
 home and school, 
 the current charge (s) 
 , and any previous 
 arrests
 or petitions. It can also include: 
 Statements from your child, you, your family, and 
 other people who know your child well; 
 A school report; 
 A statement by the victim
 ; and 
 Recommendations about what the court should do if 
 
 the judge finds that your child did what the petition 
 
 says. 
 When does the judge see the report
 s? The prob
 ation officer presents a
 report at 
 the 
 detention 
 hearing
 , disposition hearing
 , and each 
 review hearing
 . The judge use
 s 
 the report
 s 
 to help decide how to handle 
 your child™s case.

 Your Child™s Court Hearings and Orders
 If a 
 petition is filed in your child™s case, you and your child will have to go to juvenile court. Each time you go to court 
 is 
 called a ﬁhearing. ﬂ 
 You may have to go to several court hearings. This section is about: 
 What happens at the different court he
 arings, 
 What happens after the hearings, 
 What if 
 your child becomes a ward of the court, and 
 What y
 our 
 duties and responsibilities as a parent
 are
 . 
 Get Ready for Court
 How will I find out about court hearing
 s? 
 If your child
 i
 s in
 custody
 , both you and your child will 
 get 
 notice at least 5 days before the hearing. Someone will 
 deliver it personally or by certified mail. 
 If your child is 
 not
 in custody
 , both you and your child 
 will get 
 notice of 
 each court hearing
 at least 10 days 
 before the 
 date of the
 hearing. Someon
 e will deliver it 
 personally, 
 by first
 -class mail
 , or, if you agree, 
 electronically
 . Can I go to my child™s court hearings? 
 Yes. In fact, the law says you 
 must
 go. The judge decide
 s 
 what is best for your child. Depending on the charges, if 
 you can show that your child will listen to you and follow 
 your rules, and that you will hold your child accountable 
 
 and be supportive at home, the judge may let your child 
 
 go home with you. 
 How ma
 ny times 
 will
 we have to go to court? 
 You and your child will 
 probably need
 go to court several 
 times. There will be different kinds of hearings 
 where the 
 court makes
 different decisions. 
 See page 8 
 for a table 
 of 
 
 different hearing types
 . Do we have the 
 right
 to an interpreter? 
 Your child has a right to an interpreter. You m
 ight
 have a 
 right to one, too. Ask for one if you do not speak English 
 
 well and don™t understand everything being said in court. 
 Can I speak at the court hearings? 
 Yes. You may speak w
 hen: 
 The judge asks you questions, 
 You are called as a witness, or
 The judge gives you permission. 
 Who else speaks at the court hearings? 
 Your child™s lawyer will speak for your child. The 
 prosecuting attorney (DA) will speak for the government. 
 The probation officer may speak for the Probation 
 Department. 
 Can the
 victim go to the hearings? 
 Yes. A crime victim has a right to go to and speak at any 
 
 court hearing. The victim and the victim™s parents (if the 
 
 victim is under 18) will get notice of the hearing. 
 Do not 
 
 talk to the victim unless your lawyer tells you to. 
 When is the first court hearing? 
 If your child is in custody
 , the first hearing, called the
 detention hearing, 
 must take place on the court day 
 
 immediately after the petition is filed. The probatio
 n officer or prosecuting attorney (DA) must tell you when 
 and where the hearing will be. You will also get a copy of 
 the petition. At this hearing, the court decides 
 only 
 
 whether your child can go home or needs to stay in 
 
 custody until the next hearing. 
 If your child is 
 not
 in custody
 , the first hearing, often 
 called the 
 initial hearing, 
 must take place no more than 30 
 days after the petition is filed. In addition to the notice 
 described earlier, 
 you and your child 
 will get 
 a copy of the 
 petition at least
 10 days before the date of this 
 hearing. 
 What is a jurisdiction hearing? 
 The jurisdiction hearin
 g is when the judge decides if 
 your 
 child 
 actually 
 did what it says in the p
 etition. 
 Here™s what to expect: 
 The judge will ask your child to 
 
 admit
 or 
 deny
 the charges listed in the 
 petition
 . 
 Your child™s lawyer will consider the evidence and 
 the 
 
 possible outcom
 es, and 
 then advise your child what to do. 
 Juvenile Justice 
 Court: Information for Parents
 Revised January 1, 2019
 Juvenile Justice Court: Information for Parents
 JV 060 INFO

 JV 060 INFO
 If your child 
 admits
 the charges, 
 they give
 up the right 
 to a trial. The judge will decide 
 that 
 the p
 etiti
 on is tru
 e. If your child 
 denies
 the charges, there will be a trial
 (called a 
 contested hearing
 ) . 
 The court may hold the 
 trial on another day to give your child™s lawyer time to 
 get ready. 
 What happens at the 
 ﬁtrial
 ﬂ? 
 At the trial, the prosecuting attorney 
 (DA) will show 
 
 evidence to prove the charges. Then your child™s lawyer 
 
 will 
 show 
 evidence in your child™s defense. The judge 
 will consider all the evidence and decide if the charges are 
 
 true ﬁbeyond a reasonable doubt. ﬂ 
 If there is not enough proof to decide the charges are 
 true
 , the judge will dismiss the case. If your child is in 
 custody, she or he will be let go. If this happens, skip 
 ahead to 
 section 3 of this form. 
 If the judge decides the charges are true
 , there will be a 
 disposition hearing. 
 That™s when the judge will say what 
 your child will need to do and where your child will live. 
 Sometimes this hearing is right after the jurisdiction 
 hearing, but it can also be later on the same day or on 
 
 another day. 
 If you
 r child is in custody
 , the judge can order your child 
 to stay in custody or be released
 until the disposition 
 hearing. 
 What happens at the disposition hearing? 
 The judge will
 decide what orders to make 
 to protect and 
 rehabilitate your 
 child and to protect the community. 
 The judge 
 might
 order your child to: 
 Live at h
 ome and obey 
 informal 
 probation rules for up 
 to 
 six
 months. 
 Live at h
 ome, 
 be supervised by a probation officer, and 
 obey 
 rules
 set by the judge. 
 Live at a
 relative™s home, a foster 
 family 
 home, a 
 private group home, or a residential treatment 
 program; be supervised by a probation officer; and 
 
 obey rules set by the judge. 
 Spend time in a county camp, home, 
 ranch
 , or hall
 (in 
 custody) 
 and on probation. 
 Spend 
 time in t
 he Division of Juvenile Justice
 (DJJ) 
 of 
 the California Department of Corrections and 
 
 Rehabilitation
 (in custody) 
 . The judge may also order 
 you
 , the parent, to 
 get
 counseling or 
 parent training or 
 do other activities. 
 What if the ju
 dge puts my 
 child on probation? 
 If your child is put on probation, the probation officer will 
 
 supervise and work with your child to make sure that your 
 
 child follows: 
 The law, 
 The court™s orders, and 
 All the rules of probation. 
 The 
 probation officer will also encourage your child to do 
 well in school and participate in job training, counseling, 
 
 and community programs. 
 How often will the 
 probation officer see my 
 child? 
 Each case is different. The probation officer may meet 
 with your child twice a week or only once a month. 
 What if the 
 judge
 makes my child a 
 ward
 of the 
 court? 
 The j
 uvenile 
 law
 uses special
 language
 . Children 
 who 
 have committed offenses become wards of the court
 , but 
 are not
 convicted. If your child becomes a ward of the 
 court, that mean
 s the court
 is in charge of 
 some 
 of your 
 child™s care
 and conduct. The court does this to protec
 t your child and the community. 
 What if the 
 judge
 orders my child placed in 
 foster care
 ? 
 If the judge orders 
 suitable out
 -of home or foster 
 placement, t
 he 
 probation officer may place your child 
 in: 
 An adult 
 relative
 ™s home, 
 An approved 
 foster 
 family
 home, 
 A 
 licensed 
 private 
 group home, 
 or 
 A 
 residential treatment program
 . 
 If you live in a different county
 , the court 
 can
 transfer the case to your county court for the 
 disposition hearing. Ask your child™s lawyer if that is 
 a good idea for your child™s case.

 What
 if the court
 sends my child to a secure 
 county facility? 
 Most wards of the court wh
 o need secure confinement are 
 sent to county facilities, like a ranch, camp, or juvenile 
 hall, where they can be close to their families and local 
 rehabilitative services. 
 Ask the probation department 
 about your child™s program and how you can visit and 
 
 stay in touch. 
 What
 if the court sends 
 my child to 
 DJJ
 ? 
 Only wards who have committed the most serious violent 
 
 actions or need intensive treatment 
 are sent
 to DJJ. If the 
 court sends your child to DJJ, visit 
 www. cdcr. ca. gov/Juvenile Justice/
 to get more 
 information
 about where your child might go and how 
 you can visit and stay in touch. 
 If my child™s case 
 wa
 s moved to adult court, can 
 my child
 be sent to 
 adult prison? 
 Yes, but there are limits: 
 Between the ages of 14 and 18, your child 
 must
 stay at 
 a juvenile facility (DJJ) 
 even if
 sentence
 d to adult 
 prison. 
 If your child™s sentence will end before your child 
 turns 2
 5, your child can stay at a juvenile fac
 ility (DJJ) 
 for the entire sentence. 
 If your child™s sentence will last past the age of 2
 5, your child can 
 stay
 at DJJ until age 18, then be moved 
 to an adult prison on 
 the child™s
 18 th birthday. 
 Important! 
 If your child™s case gets moved to adult court, 
 talk to 
 your child™s lawyer right away. 
 Do I have to pay for what my 
 child
 did? 
 The court may order you to pay fines or penalties. 
 If the court decides that the victim is entitled to
 restitution
 , you and your child are equally responsible for 
 paying the victim back
 . Restitution
 is money that pays the 
 victim 
 to make up for the damage or harm your child 
 caused
 . Restitution 
 can 
 pay
 the victim 
 back 
 for: 
 Stolen or damaged property, 
 Medical expenses, and
 Lost wages. 
 If restitution is not completely 
 paid when your child™s 
 case is closed, it will become a 
 civil judgment, 
 which can 
 affect your credit score. 
 Do I have to pay fees for services my child 
 
 receives
 from the court or county
 ? 
 No. You do not have to pay fees or 
 pay back the cost of
 services
 , sup
 port, or an attorney 
 given to 
 your child
 by the 
 county or court 
 as part of this case. 
 But if you can afford it, you m
 ight
 have to pay 
 back the 
 cost of
 services
 , including an attorney, 
 given to you or 
 other family members
 by 
 the county or the court. 
 What are
 my 
 responsibilities
 as a parent? 
 Your parent
 al duties
 do not end when the court gets 
 involved. Your child may need you now more than ever. 
 If the judge decides the charges in the petition are true, 
 you may be ordered to do things to: 
 Help make up for harm your child caused, and 
 Keep your child out of trouble in the future. 
 The court may order you 
 to: 
 Take classes, 
 Go to counseling, or 
 Do other activities that will help you and your child. 
 What if 
 my child is in foster care or in custody
 ? 
 Wherever
 your c
 hild goes, stay in touch
 as much
 as you 
 can, however you can. Visit your child as often as you 
 can. Support your child™s programs and activities. 
 Encourage your child to obey the court™s orders and 
 not 
 to 
 
 leave the placement without permission. 
 Find out what is happening in your child™s life so that you 
 
 can get ready for your child to return home. Learn how to 
 
 make a protective and supportive environment for your 
 child™s return to school or work. Develop plans to hold 
 your child accountable 
 for their action
 s. 
 Where can
 I find parenting resources? 
 Contact your child™s probation officer. Ask for referrals to 
 
 community organizations, such as parents™ groups or 
 
 counseling services
 , that can help you. Your school 
 district and local hospital or mental health department 
 may also have useful programs. 
 If you
 have 
 any questions 
 that have not been answered
 , you may want to contact a lawyer for help.

 3 How to Keep
 Your Child™s 
 Juvenile
 Court 
 Record
 s 
 Private
 Will 
 anyone be able to look at 
 my 
 child™s
 juvenile 
 records? 
 Maybe. 
 Although most juvenile court records are 
 confidential, the law sometimes allows government 
 
 officials to look at them. 
 However, in many cases t
 he court 
 will
 ﬁsealﬂ your child™s 
 juvenile records. Once the record
 s 
 are
 sealed, 
 the law 
 treats
 the 
 arrest and court case
 as if they 
 never happened. 
 That means your child can truthfully say that 
 your child 
 
 does not have 
 a criminal or juvenile record. 
 Exception: 
 If your child wants to join the military or get a 
 federal security clearance, 
 your child may need to 
 disclose
 information 
 about the juvenile record
 . 
 How 
 can we seal my child™s 
 juvenile
 records? 
 It depends on your child™s situation. 
 Sealing
 at dismissal
 . If the juvenile court dismisses your 
 child™s case
 without making your child 
 a ward of the 
 court, the court 
 must
 seal
 your child™s records. 
 If 
 the court does make your child 
 a ward
 and later
 dismisses the case becaus
 e your child has 
 satisfactorily 
 
 completed 
 probation
 , the court 
 will
 also seal your child™s 
 records and send your child copies 
 of the sealing order 
 and form JV 596-
 INFO, 
 Sealing of Records for 
 Satisfactory Completion of Probation. 
 If your child completes a probation diversion program, 
 
 the probation department will seal those records and give 
 notice to your child. 
 Sealing on request. 
 If your child does 
 not
 satisfactorily
 complete probation or the probation diversion program, 
 
 the court will 
 not
 dismiss the
 case and your child™s 
 records
 will not be automatically sealed
 . Your child can 
 either: 
 Ask the court to review the probation department™s 
 
 decision
 and order the records sealed
 , or 
 Ask the court later to seal the records. (See form 
 JV 595-
 INFO, 
 How to Ask 
 the Court to Seal Your 
 Records, 
 for more information. ) 
 If your child is made a ward for an offense listed in 
 
 Welfare and Institutions Code 
 section 707 (b) , 
 other than
 
 sex offense
 s 
 requiring the child to register as a sex 
 
 offender, your child can ask the 
 court to seal the records: 
 At age 21, if your child was sent to DJJ; 
 or At age 18, if your child was not sent to DJJ. 
 Even sealed records can be viewed by the prosecuting 
 
 attorney in some cases. 
 Sealing not allowed. 
 If t
 he court found that that your 
 child 
 committed a sex
 offense listed in Welfare & 
 Institutions Code 
 section 
 707 (b) when your child was 14 
 or older 
 for which your child needs to register as a sex 
 offender, then the court 
 can
 not seal your child™s records
 . Can my 
 child™s
 juvenile court record be 
 used against him or her as an adult? 
 Under the 
 three
 -strikes law, some serious or violent 
 felonies committed by a child at age 16 
 or 17 can be 
 counted as strikes and used against 
 the 
 child in the future.

 Court 
 Hearings in Juvenile Justice Court
 You and your child may have go to court several times. Each time you go is called a ﬁhearing. ﬂ Depending on your case, 
 there may be different kinds of hearings to make different decisions. Here are some of them. Each time
 you have to go to 
 court, you and your child (if 8 or older
 ) will get a 
 notice. The notice will tell you the date, time, and 
 place
 to go. 
 Kind of Hearing
 What happens at this hearing
 Detention
 The judge will decide if your child can go home or must stay in custody until the next hearing. 
 Transfer to Criminal 
 Court
 The juvenile court judge will decide if the case of a child who is 14 or older should be transferred to adult 
 criminal 
 court. Children under 14 cannot have their cases transferred to adult court. This hearing only 
 happens for very serious or violent charges and only if the prosecuting attorney (DA) asks for the transfer. 
 Jurisdiction, part 1 
 (pretrial or settlement 
 conference) 
 The judge, lawyers, and probation officer try to 
 resolve the case without having a trial. The judge decides if 
 your child actually did what the petition says. The judge will ask your child to 
 admit
 or 
 deny
 the charges listed 
 in the petition. Your child™s lawyer will consider the evidence and 
 possible outco
 mes
 , and 
 then advise your 
 child what to do. 
 If your child 
 admits
 the charges, 
 your
 child 
 will give
 up the right to a trial. The judge will decide that the petition 
 is true. 
 If your child 
 denies
 the charges, there will be a trial, usually a week or two late
 r. Jurisdiction, part 2 
 (trial) 
 At the trial, the prosecuting attorney will show evidence to prove the charges. Then your child™s lawyer will 
 present your child™s defense. The judge will consider all the evidence and decide if the charges are true 
 ﬁbeyond
 a reasonable doubt. ﬂ
 Œ If there is not enough proof to decide the charges are true
 , the judge will dismiss the case. If your 
 child is in custody, she or he will be let go. 
 Œ If the judge decides the charges are true
 , there will be a disposition hearing. 
 Disposition
 This happens 
 only
 if the
 judge decides
 that
 the petition is true. The judge then
 decide
 s 
 what orders to make 
 for your child. This hearing is often right after the jurisdiction hearing
 but can also be postponed to another 
 day. 
 Hearings on 
 Motions
 The court decides legal questions that affect the case. 
 Review Hearings
 This hearing provides a
 way for the court to check how your child is doing 
 on probation or in placement. If 
 your child is placed in foster care, the court must hold a review hearing at least once every six months.
