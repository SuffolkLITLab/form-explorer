Juvenile Justice Court: Information for Parents 

Juvenile justice court (sometimes called delinquency court) is a court that decides if a child broke the law. The juvenile 
justice court helps to protect, guide, and rehabilitate children. And it helps keep the community safe. 

This information sheet answers common questions that many parents have. It has three sections: 

1.  What Happens When Your Child Is Arrested 
2.  Juvenile Court Hearings and Orders 
3.  How to Keep Your Child’s Juvenile Court Record Private 

This form describes the juvenile justice court process. Some children who break the law and become involved with law 
enforcement or probation never need to go to court. 

 1    What Happens When Your Child Is Arrested 

This section is about: 

  What to expect when your child is arrested, 
  What your child’s legal rights are, 
  What the notice to appear and the petition are, 
  What it means to transfer your child to adult court, and 
  What a probation officer does. 

My child was arrested. What happens next? 
Your child might be brought home or allowed to go home with you. 

You will be given or mailed a notice to appear that tells you the date, time, and place you and your child need to go to the 
probation department or juvenile court. Talk to a qualified juvenile defense lawyer about your child’s case. Many juvenile 
defenders offer free consultations. 

Warning! You and your child must go to the meeting listed on the notice to appear even if no one contacts you again. 
Sometimes the meeting will be at probation. Sometimes the notice will order you to go to the juvenile court. 

Your child might NOT be sent home immediately after the arrest. 

If that happens, the officer who arrested your child may: 
•  Let your child go later. 
•  Take your child to juvenile hall and keep them there. This is called in-custody detention. If this happens, the arresting 

officer must try to contact you immediately to tell you where your child is and that your child is in custody. 

What are my child’s legal rights after arrest? 
 Your child has the right to make at least  
two phone calls within 1 hour of being arrested. 

•  One call must be a completed call to a parent, 
guardian, responsible relative, or employer. 

•  The other call must be a completed call to a lawyer. 

•  If your child is currently in court-ordered foster care, 
your child may also be allowed to call a foster parent 
or social worker. 

Will they tell my child about the right to remain 
silent? 
Yes. Before any officer asks your child about what 
happened, the officer must first tell your child about your 
child’s Miranda rights. 

They will say: 

“You have the right to remain silent. Anything 
you say will be used against you in court. You 
have a right to have a lawyer with you during 
questioning. If you or your parents cannot afford 
a lawyer, one will be appointed for you.”

Juvenile Justice Court: Information for Parents 

NOTE: If your child is 15 years old or younger and in 
custody, your child must talk to a lawyer—in person, by 
phone, or by videoconference (like Skype or FaceTime)—
before answering any questions or giving up any rights. 
Your child cannot decide to answer questions or give up 
rights without first talking to a lawyer. 

•  The probation officer might offer to let your child do a 
special diversion program instead of going to court. 
Each county has different rules and different programs. 
If you and your child agree to the program and your 
child does everything the program requires, the 
juvenile court does not need to get involved. 

Does my child need a lawyer? 
If a petition is filed, your child has a right to an effective 
and prepared court-appointed lawyer, who must 
have specific education and training in juvenile 
justice cases. Many parents hire a lawyer for their 
child as soon as the child is arrested. 

Your child’s lawyer represents only your child, not you, 
even if you are paying for that lawyer. 

Do I need a lawyer for myself? 
The court can order you to do things for your child and 
can order you to pay restitution to the victim. Some 
parents hire lawyers for legal advice about these issues. 

NOTE: If you think you need your own lawyer and 
cannot afford to hire one, you can ask the court to appoint 
a lawyer for you. The court will decide whether to appoint 
you a lawyer. If it does, you might be ordered to pay back 
the cost of the lawyer if the court decides you can. 

If my child is required to meet with probation, 
how can we get ready? 
It’s a good idea to get legal advice. A defense lawyer who 
specializes in juvenile justice cases can help you 
understand your child’s rights and know what to expect. 
Try to find school records and other information that 
shows what you and your child are doing to get back on 
track. 

At the meeting, the probation officer will talk with you 
and your child to figure out the best way to handle your 
child’s case. 

NOTE: At this meeting, the probation officer must tell 
you and your child about the Miranda rights. Any 
information you or your child share with the probation 
officer might be shared with the court or the prosecuting 
attorney (DA). 

•  If the alleged offense is not serious or it’s the first time 
your child has been accused of breaking the law, the 
probation officer might just tell your child what they 
did was wrong (reprimand them) and let your child go. 

 

Revised January 1, 2019 

 

•  If the offense is more serious, the probation officer 
might refer your child’s case to the prosecuting 
attorney (DA). If the prosecutor decides to file 
charges, they will file a petition in juvenile court. 
That’s what the rest of this form is about. 

What happens if my child is taken to juvenile hall 
after getting arrested? 
The probation officer can decide to: 
•  Keep your child in custody, or 
•  Let your child go home with you. 

If the officer lets your child go, they may still: 
•  Ask the DA to file a petition, and 
•  Set limits on what your child is allowed to do while at 

home. 

If the officer does not let your child go, a petition must be 
filed within 48 hours of the arrest. A detention hearing 
must be held the next day the court is in session. The 
courts are closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. 
You and your child must be given a copy of the petition. 
Exception: If your child is under 8, your child does not 
have a right to get a copy of the petition. 

How long can they keep my child in juvenile 
hall? 
The judge will decide at the detention hearing. The judge 
may release your child or keep your child in juvenile hall 
until the next hearing or until the whole case is over. 

Can I visit my child in juvenile hall? 
Usually, but before you go, contact the juvenile hall or the 
probation officer to find out when you can see your child. 

What if the probation officer says a petition will 
be filed? 
The petition states the things your child is accused of or 
charged with. It means your child’s case will be sent to 
juvenile court. You have the right to receive a copy of the 
petition. If you have not received a copy of the petition, 
ask the probation officer or the court clerk for one.

JV-060-INFO 

Juvenile Justice Court: Information for Parents 

The petition says your child did something against the law 
and asks the juvenile court to decide that what it says is 
true, but it does not prove anything. 
Read the Petition Carefully! It is important to know 
what your child is accused of. 

Are all petitions the same? 
No. Each petition is tailored to the child and the alleged 
offense. There are two kinds of petitions: 

A 601 Petition is filed when a child has: 

•  Run away, 
•  Skipped school a lot, 
•  Violated a curfew, or 
•  Regularly disobeyed a parent or guardian. 

These petitions are filed by the probation department at 
the juvenile court. If the court decides the charges are 
true, your child can become a “ward” of the court. That 
means the court will supervise your child, and your child 
must obey the court’s orders. 

A 602 Petition is for a charge that would be a 
misdemeanor (like shoplifting or simple assault) or felony 
(like stealing a car, selling drugs, rape, or murder) if an 
adult had done it. 

These petitions are filed by the prosecuting attorney 
(DA). If the court decides the charges are true, the judge 
can: 

•  Order your child put on probation, 
•  Make your child a “ward” of the court, and 
•  Order your child placed out of your home or 

committed (locked up). 

NOTE: If your family is involved with the child welfare 
system, talk with your lawyer about what your child’s 
arrest means for that case. Depending on everything that 
has happened, the court might decide that it’s best for 
your child to stay in the child welfare system, to be 
supervised in the juvenile justice system, or to be 
supervised and served in both systems. 

Can my child’s case be moved to adult court? 
In certain situations, the prosecuting attorney (DA) can 
ask the juvenile court to transfer your child’s case to adult 
criminal court. If that happens, talk to your child’s lawyer 

 

right away. Adult criminal cases are handled very 
differently and there may be very serious consequences 
for your child. 

A case can only be transferred to adult court if your child is: 

•  14 years old or older, and 

•  Charged with a very serious or violent offense, such as: 

o  Murder and attempted murder; 
o  Setting a building on fire when there is someone 

inside (arson); 

o  Robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon; 
o  Some rape, kidnapping, and carjacking cases; 
o  Some firearms and drug offenses; and 
o  Some violent escapes from a juvenile detention 

facility. 

What does the probation officer do? 
Probation officers investigate children’s situations and 
backgrounds and write reports for the court. They also 
supervise children to see if they are doing what the court 
has ordered them to do. 

Why does the probation officer write a report? 
The probation officer writes reports to give the court 
information about your child. The reports give the judge a 
description of your child’s situation, including life at 
home and school, the current charge(s), and any previous 
arrests or petitions. It can also include: 

•  Statements from your child, you, your family, and 

other people who know your child well; 

•  A school report; 

•  A statement by the victim; and 

•  Recommendations about what the court should do if 
the judge finds that your child did what the petition 
says. 

When does the judge see the reports? 
The probation officer presents a report at the detention 
hearing, disposition hearing, and each review hearing. 
The judge uses the reports to help decide how to handle 
your child’s case.

 2    Your Child’s Court Hearings and Orders 

If a petition is filed in your child’s case, you and your child will have to go to juvenile court. Each time you go to court is 
called a “hearing.” You may have to go to several court hearings. This section is about: 

Who else speaks at the court hearings? 
Your child’s lawyer will speak for your child. The 
prosecuting attorney (DA) will speak for the government. 
The probation officer may speak for the Probation 
Department. 

Can the victim go to the hearings? 
Yes. A crime victim has a right to go to and speak at any 
court hearing. The victim and the victim’s parents (if the 
victim is under 18) will get notice of the hearing. Do not 
talk to the victim unless your lawyer tells you to. 

When is the first court hearing? 
If your child is in custody, the first hearing, called the 
detention hearing, must take place on the court day 
immediately after the petition is filed. The probation 
officer or prosecuting attorney (DA) must tell you when 
and where the hearing will be. You will also get a copy of 
the petition. At this hearing, the court decides only 
whether your child can go home or needs to stay in 
custody until the next hearing. 

If your child is not in custody, the first hearing, often 
called the initial hearing, must take place no more than 30 
days after the petition is filed. In addition to the notice 
described earlier, you and your child will get a copy of the 
petition at least 10 days before the date of this hearing. 

What is a jurisdiction hearing? 
The jurisdiction hearing is when the judge decides if your 
child actually did what it says in the petition. 

Here’s what to expect: 

•  The judge will ask your child to 

admit or deny the charges listed in the 
petition. 

•  Your child’s lawyer will consider the evidence and the 
possible outcomes, and then advise your child what to do. 

  What happens at the different court hearings, 
  What happens after the hearings, 
  What if your child becomes a ward of the court, and 
  What your duties and responsibilities as a parent are. 

et Ready for Court 

  G

How will I find out about court hearings? 
If your child is in custody, both you and your child will 
get notice at least 5 days before the hearing. Someone will 
deliver it personally or by certified mail. 

If your child is not in custody, both you and your child 
will get notice of each court hearing at least 10 days 
before the date of the hearing. Someone will deliver it 
personally, by first-class mail, or, if you agree, 
electronically. 

Can I go to my child’s court hearings? 
Yes. In fact, the law says you must go. The judge decides 
what is best for your child. Depending on the charges, if 
you can show that your child will listen to you and follow 
your rules, and that you will hold your child accountable 
and be supportive at home, the judge may let your child 
go home with you. 

How many times will we have to go to court? 
You and your child will probably need go to court several 
times. There will be different kinds of hearings where the 
court makes different decisions. See page 8 for a table of 
different hearing types. 

Do we have the right to an interpreter? 
Your child has a right to an interpreter. You might have a 
right to one, too. Ask for one if you do not speak English 
well and don’t understand everything being said in court. 

Can I speak at the court hearings? 
Yes. You may speak when: 

•  The judge asks you questions, 
•  You are called as a witness, or 
•  The judge gives you permission.

Juvenile Justice Court: Information for Parents 

•  If your child admits the charges, they give up the right 
to a trial. The judge will decide that the petition is true. 

•  If your child denies the charges, there will be a trial 
(called a contested hearing). The court may hold the 
trial on another day to give your child’s lawyer time to 
get ready. 

What happens at the “trial”? 
At the trial, the prosecuting attorney (DA) will show 
evidence to prove the charges. Then your child’s lawyer 
will show evidence in your child’s defense. The judge 
will consider all the evidence and decide if the charges are 
true “beyond a reasonable doubt.” 

If there is not enough proof to decide the charges are 
true, the judge will dismiss the case. If your child is in 
custody, she or he will be let go. If this happens, skip 
ahead to section 3 of this form. 

If the judge decides the charges are true, there will be a 
disposition hearing. That’s when the judge will say what 
your child will need to do and where your child will live. 
Sometimes this hearing is right after the jurisdiction 
hearing, but it can also be later on the same day or on 
another day. 

If your child is in custody, the judge can order your child 
to stay in custody or be released until the disposition 
hearing. 

If you live in a different county, the court can 
transfer the case to your county court for the 
disposition hearing. Ask your child’s lawyer if that is 
a good idea for your child’s case. 

What happens at the disposition hearing? 
The judge will decide what orders to make to protect and 
rehabilitate your child and to protect the community. 

The judge might order your child to: 

•  Spend time in a county camp, home, ranch, or hall (in 

custody) and on probation. 

•  Spend time in the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) of 

the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation (in custody). 

The judge may also order you, the parent, to get 
counseling or parent training or do other activities. 

What if the judge puts my child on probation? 
If your child is put on probation, the probation officer will 
supervise and work with your child to make sure that your 
child follows: 

•  The law, 

•  The court’s orders, and 

•  All the rules of probation. 

The probation officer will also encourage your child to do 
well in school and participate in job training, counseling, 
and community programs. 

How often will the probation officer see my 
child? 
Each case is different. The probation officer may meet 
with your child twice a week or only once a month. 

What if the judge makes my child a ward of the 
court? 
The juvenile law uses special language. Children who 
have committed offenses become wards of the court, but 
are not convicted. If your child becomes a ward of the 
court, that means the court is in charge of some of your 
child’s care and conduct. The court does this to protect 
your child and the community. 

 

What if the judge orders my child placed in 
foster care? 
If the judge orders suitable out-of-home or foster 
placement, the probation officer may place your child in: 

•  Live at home and obey informal probation rules for up 

to six months. 

•  An adult relative’s home, 

•  Live at home, be supervised by a probation officer, and 

•  An approved foster family home, 

•  A licensed private group home, or 

•  A residential treatment program. 

obey rules set by the judge. 

•  Live at a relative’s home, a foster family home, a 
private group home, or a residential treatment 
program; be supervised by a probation officer; and 
obey rules set by the judge.

Juvenile Justice Court: Information for Parents 

What if the court sends my child to a secure 
county facility? 
Most wards of the court who need secure confinement are 
sent to county facilities, like a ranch, camp, or juvenile 
hall, where they can be close to their families and local 
rehabilitative services. Ask the probation department 
about your child’s program and how you can visit and 
stay in touch. 

What if the court sends my child to DJJ? 
Only wards who have committed the most serious violent 
actions or need intensive treatment are sent to DJJ. If the 
court sends your child to DJJ, visit 
www.cdcr.ca.gov/Juvenile_Justice/ to get more 
information about where your child might go and how 
you can visit and stay in touch. 

If my child’s case was moved to adult court, can 
my child be sent to adult prison? 
Yes, but there are limits: 
•  Between the ages of 14 and 18, your child must stay at 
a juvenile facility (DJJ) even if sentenced to adult 
prison. 

•  If your child’s sentence will end before your child 

turns 25, your child can stay at a juvenile facility (DJJ) 
for the entire sentence. 

•  If your child’s sentence will last past the age of 25, 

your child can stay at DJJ until age 18, then be moved 
to an adult prison on the child’s 18th birthday. 

Important! If your child’s case gets moved to adult court, 
talk to your child’s lawyer right away. 

Do I have to pay for what my child did? 
The court may order you to pay fines or penalties. 

If the court decides that the victim is entitled to 
restitution, you and your child are equally responsible for 
paying the victim back. Restitution is money that pays the 
victim to make up for the damage or harm your child 
caused. Restitution can pay the victim back for: 
•  Stolen or damaged property, 
•  Medical expenses, and 
•  Lost wages. 
If restitution is not completely paid when your child’s 
case is closed, it will become a civil judgment, which can 
affect your credit score. 

 

Revised January 1, 2019 

 

Do I have to pay fees for services my child 
receives from the court or county? 
No. You do not have to pay fees or pay back the cost of 
services, support, or an attorney given to your child by the 
county or court as part of this case. 

But if you can afford it, you might have to pay back the 
cost of services, including an attorney, given to you or 
other family members by the county or the court. 

What are my responsibilities as a parent? 
Your parental duties do not end when the court gets 
involved. Your child may need you now more than ever. 

If the judge decides the charges in the petition are true, 
you may be ordered to do things to: 

•  Help make up for harm your child caused, and 

•  Keep your child out of trouble in the future. 

The court may order you to: 

•  Take classes, 

•  Go to counseling, or 

•  Do other activities that will help you and your child. 

What if my child is in foster care or in custody? 
Wherever your child goes, stay in touch as much as you 
can, however you can. Visit your child as often as you 
can. Support your child’s programs and activities. 
Encourage your child to obey the court’s orders and not to 
leave the placement without permission. 

Find out what is happening in your child’s life so that you 
can get ready for your child to return home. Learn how to 
make a protective and supportive environment for your 
child’s return to school or work. Develop plans to hold 
your child accountable for their actions. 

Where can I find parenting resources? 
Contact your child’s probation officer. Ask for referrals to 
community organizations, such as parents’ groups or 
counseling services, that can help you. Your school 
district and local hospital or mental health department 
may also have useful programs. 

If you have any questions that have not been answered, 
you may want to contact a lawyer for help.

 3    How to Keep Your Child’s Juvenile Court Records Private 

Will anyone be able to look at my child’s juvenile 
records? 
Maybe. Although most juvenile court records are 
confidential, the law sometimes allows government 
officials to look at them. 

However, in many cases the court will “seal” your child’s 
juvenile records. Once the records are sealed, the law 
treats the arrest and court case as if they never happened. 
That means your child can truthfully say that your child 
does not have a criminal or juvenile record. 

Exception: If your child wants to join the military or get a 
federal security clearance, your child may need to 
disclose information about the juvenile record. 

How can we seal my child’s juvenile records? 
It depends on your child’s situation. 

Sealing at dismissal. If the juvenile court dismisses your 
child’s case without making your child a ward of the 
court, the court must seal your child’s records. 

If the court does make your child a ward and later 
dismisses the case because your child has satisfactorily 
completed probation, the court will also seal your child’s 
records and send your child copies of the sealing order 
and form JV-596-INFO, Sealing of Records for 
Satisfactory Completion of Probation. 

If your child completes a probation diversion program, 
the probation department will seal those records and give 
notice to your child. 

Sealing on request. If your child does not satisfactorily 
complete probation or the probation diversion program, 
the court will not dismiss the case and your child’s 
records will not be automatically sealed. Your child can 
either: 

•  Ask the court to review the probation department’s 

decision and order the records sealed, or 

•  Ask the court later to seal the records. (See form 

JV-595-INFO, How to Ask the Court to Seal Your 
Records, for more information.) 

If your child is made a ward for an offense listed in 
Welfare and Institutions Code section 707(b), other than 
sex offenses requiring the child to register as a sex 
offender, your child can ask the court to seal the records: 

•  At age 21, if your child was sent to DJJ; or 

•  At age 18, if your child was not sent to DJJ. 

Even sealed records can be viewed by the prosecuting 
attorney in some cases. 

Sealing not allowed. If the court found that that your 
child committed a sex offense listed in Welfare & 
Institutions Code section 707(b) when your child was 14 
or older for which your child needs to register as a sex 
offender, then the court cannot seal your child’s records. 

Can my child’s juvenile court record be used 
against him or her as an adult? 
Under the three-strikes law, some serious or violent 
felonies committed by a child at age 16 or 17 can be 
counted as strikes and used against the child in the future.

Court Hearings in Juvenile Justice Court 

You and your child may have go to court several times. Each time you go is called a “hearing.” Depending on your case, 
there may be different kinds of hearings to make different decisions. Here are some of them. Each time you have to go to 
court, you and your child (if 8 or older) will get a notice. The notice will tell you the date, time, and place to go. 

Kind of Hearing 

What happens at this hearing 

Detention 

The judge will decide if your child can go home or must stay in custody until the next hearing. 

Transfer to Criminal 
Court 

The juvenile court judge will decide if the case of a child who is 14 or older should be transferred to adult 
criminal court. Children under 14 cannot have their cases transferred to adult court. This hearing only 
happens for very serious or violent charges and only if the prosecuting attorney (DA) asks for the transfer. 

Jurisdiction, part 1 
(pretrial or settlement 
conference) 

The judge, lawyers, and probation officer try to resolve the case without having a trial. The judge decides if 
your child actually did what the petition says. The judge will ask your child to admit or deny the charges listed 
in the petition. Your child’s lawyer will consider the evidence and possible outcomes, and then advise your 
child what to do. 
If your child admits the charges, your child will give up the right to a trial. The judge will decide that the petition 
is true. 
If your child denies the charges, there will be a trial, usually a week or two later. 

Jurisdiction, part 2 
(trial) 

At the trial, the prosecuting attorney will show evidence to prove the charges. Then your child’s lawyer will 
present your child’s defense. The judge will consider all the evidence and decide if the charges are true 
“beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
– 

If there is not enough proof to decide the charges are true, the judge will dismiss the case. If your 
child is in custody, she or he will be let go. 
If the judge decides the charges are true, there will be a disposition hearing. 

– 

Disposition 

This happens only if the judge decides that the petition is true. The judge then decides what orders to make 
for your child. This hearing is often right after the jurisdiction hearing but can also be postponed to another 
day. 

Hearings on Motions  The court decides legal questions that affect the case. 

Review Hearings 

This hearing provides a way for the court to check how your child is doing on probation or in placement. If 
your child is placed in foster care, the court must hold a review hearing at least once every six months.
