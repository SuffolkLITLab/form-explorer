 JV 350 INFO
 This 
 form
 is about becomin
 g the guardian of a child
 at the end of the
 child™s
 juvenile
 court case
 if the child cannot return home
 or be adopted
 . The form
 explains: 
 Who can become a guardian
 ; How to ask to become a guardian
 in juvenile court
 ; The differences between 
 a foster parent, 
 a guardian, 
 and
 an adoptive parent
 ; and
 A guardian™s legal rights
 , duties
 , and eligibility for financial help

 . What is a guardian? 
 A guardian
 is a person
 , other than a parent, 
 who has 
 legal 
 and physical custody of a child and can
 make 
 the 
 decisions 
 that a 
 parent can 
 about 
 the
 child™s care
 and control
 , residence
 , education, and medical treatment. 
 Who can become 
 a guardian
 in juvenile court
 ? To become a child™s 
 court
 -appointed 
 guardian, you must: 
 Be an adult (18 
 years old 
 or older) 
 ; Not be the child™s parent
 ; and
 Be approved by the county child welfare agency
 or juv
 enile probation department
 . Can a relative be a
 ppointed
 guardian? 
 Yes. 
 The juvenile court can appoint
 any 
 approved 
 adult
 , including a
 ny relative
 except
 for 
 the child™s parent
 . How does 
 a juvenile court 
 case start
 ? A social worker or prosecuting attorney files a 
 petition 
 asking the court to 
 make orders to keep the 
 child and the community safe. 
 Sometimes, the court 
 decides that 
 a child cannot live safely
 in a parent™s 
 home
 . And 
 the court
 cannot let the child go home 
 unless
 the home is
 safe
 . If the child 
 cannot live safely at home, 
 what 
 happens? If the court 
 cannot let 
 a child go 
 home, the social 
 worker or probation officer 
 will
 find a safe 
 home 
 where the child can
 live. 
 They will try
 to find a 
 relative
 to 
 care for the child
 . If they can
 ™t find a 
 relative, they will look for a nonrelative
 to 
 care for 
 the child
 . The
 initial caregiver 
 often 
 become
 s a foster parent
 if approved as a resource family. 
 If you want to be 
 a child™s foster parent, tell the 
 social worker or probation officer 
 right away
 . Ask 
 how 
 you can
 get 
 approved as
 a resource family. 
 A foster parent is often appointed as guardian. 
 Wait
 ing
 too long
 can prevent the child from 
 ever be
 ing
 placed with you. 
 Is a
 foster parent 
 the same as 
 a guardian? 
 No. 
 A foster parent
 is not
 a guardian
 , but the court 
 can and 
 often 
 will appoint 
 a foster parent
 as a guardian
 . Foster parents
 have 
 legal rights, including
 : The right to 
 receive
 notice of
 the
 child™s court 
 hearings
 and go to the hearings
 ; and
 The right to g
 ive the court information about the
 child™s needs. 
 How is a guardian different from a foster 
 parent? 
 Foster parents and guardians are both responsible for 
 taking care of other people™s 
 children. But there are 
 important differences. 
 Permanence. 
 Foster care is intended to be 
 temporary; it can end at any time. A guardianship 
 gives a child a stable, lasting home and relationship. 
 Court supervision. 
 The court holds review hearings 
 every six months for a child in foster care. A social 
 worker or probation officer visits a foster placement 
 regularly. In a guardianship, no
 regular hearings or 
 visits are required unless the court keeps the juvenile 
 case o
 pen. 
 2 4 5 6 To become the guardian of a child who 
 does 
 not
 have a juvenile court case, 
 you 
 must 
 ask the 
 probate
 court
 . Read 
 Judicial Council 
 form

 -505, and GC
 -510 to learn more

 Duties. 
 A foster parent provides food, clothing, 
 housing, and emotional support to the child under 
 the supervision of a social worker or probation 
 officer. A guardian has more rights and duties 
 toward
 the child, but 
 may receive
 fewer services and 
 less
 personal support. 
 Who else can
 be involved in the child™s court 
 case? 
 The child™s r
 elatives
 . If you are a relative, even if 
 not the 
 child™s 
 foster parent
 or caregiver
 , you can 
 still give 
 the court 
 imp
 ortant information 
 in writing. 
 Will the child be returned to 
 the parent
 ? In most cases, the 
 social worker or probation officer 
 works with the family
 by giving them services so 
 that the child can return to live at home
 . Sometimes
 the court 
 decide
 s the child 
 will not be 
 able to
 return home safely. 
 If 
 that happens, 
 the court 
 will 
 deny
 or stop 
 services 
 for the parent
 . The social 
 worker or probation officer will recommend 
 to the 
 court 
 a permanent plan 
 for the child
 in a written 
 report. 
 Is guardianship a 
 permanent plan? 
 Yes. A guardianship is 
 one 
 of 
 three
 authorized
 permanent plan
 s. It 
 is 
 intended to last until the child 
 turns 18
 years of age
 . If the child cannot return 
 home, adoption is the preferred 
 permanent 
 plan
 because it is more 
 stable and 
 secure. (Later, this 
 form 
 talks more about adoption
 . ) But i
 f adoption is 
 not 
 a legally
 available option
 , the court will try to 
 appoint a guardian
 for the child
 . HOW 
 CAN I
 BECOME 
 THE
 CHILD™S 
 GUARDIAN
 ? How do I ask to become the guardian? 
 If you want the court 
 to appoint you
 the child™s 
 guardian, you should: 
 Tell the social w
 orker or probation officer
 right 
 away
 ; and
 Ask the
 judge
 at 
 a hearing
 as soon as you can
 . Think carefully! 
 If the court 
 appoints you
 , the
 guardianship
 will last until the child turns 
 18. The 
 court 
 will not ﬁundoﬂ or end a guardianship unless: 
 The situation
 has changed
 since appointment
 ; and
 It is in the child™s best interests to 
 end it
 . What are the s
 teps to
 becoming
 a guardian
 ? There
 are several steps to becoming a
 child™s 
 guardian
 in juvenile court
 : a. The social worker or probation officer will 
 interview you and
 visit your home to make sur
 e you
 , your home
 , and everyone living there
 are 
 safe for the child
 . b. The social worker or probation officer will write 
 a report to the court 
 to recommend a permanent 
 plan for the child
 . Note: 
 If 
 you are
 not recommend
 ed 
 as guardian, 
 ask the social worker or probation officer if they 
 will name you as a prospective successor 
 guardian. Then you might be assessed and 
 appointed if the first 
 appointed
 guardian
 can no 
 longer serve
 . c. There will be a court hearing to decide
 the child™s 
 permanent plan
 . You will get a
 notice
 that tells 
 you when and where the 
 hearing will 
 happen
 . d. Go 
 to the hearing and talk to the judge. The 
 child™s parents and other 
 people interested in the 
 case can also go to the hearing and tell the judge 
 what they think about you being the child™s 
 guardian. 
 How 
 does the court decide 
 whether to 
 appoint me 
 as guardian
 ? The 
 court
 will consider: 
 Whether the child can be adopted
 ; The 
 recommend
 ation in 
 the agency™s 
 report
 ; What you and other people sa
 y at the hearing
 ; and
 Any o
 ther reasons for 
 or against 
 appointing
 you 
 as guardian. 
 The 
 court
 will 
 appoint you
 as guardian if 
 it decides 
 that: 
 A guardianship is best for the child
 ; and You would be a good guardian. 
 What if the court 
 appoints me
 as 
 guardian? 
 If 
 the court 
 appoints you
 as 
 guardian, take the order
 to the clerk and 
 ask for
 a certified copy of
 Letters of 
 Guardianship
 (form JV
 -330) . Th
 at form i
 s proof 
 that you are the 
 child™s guardian. Make copies of 
 this form
 and keep the 
 certified copy
 in a safe place.

 Take a copy of t
 he form
 with you 
 whenever you
 : Take the child to 
 a doctor
 , dentist, or 
 therapist
 ; Sign the child up for school
 or go to school 
 meetings
 ; or Travel 
 with the child. 
 Will
 the court 
 overse
 e me as
 guardian? 
 When it appoints you, t
 he court
 can 
 give you other 
 orders
 , such as 
 to 
 notify the court if you move or 
 to 
 allow the parents or 
 sibling
 s to 
 visit and 
 spend time 
 with the child. 
 You must obey the 
 court™s orders. 
 After it appoints you, the 
 juvenile 
 court 
 may
 oversee
 the guardianship to make su
 re you perform your 
 duties. Y
 ou won™t
 usually
 have to go to court unless 
 the court keeps the juvenile case open or 
 someone 
 asks the court to change its orders 
 or make new 
 orders. 
 Note: 
 Even after the juvenile case is closed, a
 nyone, 
 including you, 
 can use 
 Request to Change Court 
 Order
 (form JV
 -180) to ask the 
 juvenile 
 court to 
 give you directions, 
 review
 your plans or actions
 as guardian
 , change its previous 
 orders, or end the 
 guardianship. 
 The social worker or probation officer might also 
 offer
 permanent placement services 
 to the child. 
 If 
 you™re not related to the child, a social worker will 
 visit you every six months and update a voluntary 
 case plan
 . If you
 don™t do what the
 case plan says
 , they 
 might 
 ask 
 the
 court 
 to 
 order 
 you 
 to do it. 
 When 
 will the
 guardianship end? 
 A guardianship 
 lasts until
 the child turns 18 unless: 
 The child dies
 before then
 ; The child is adopted
 (by you or another adult) 
 ; or The child is emancipated 
 (or freed from your 
 control) 
 by getting married, entering active 
 military duty, or 
 getting a 
 court order
 . The court can order a guardianship to end
 before the 
 child turns 18
 , but 
 only 
 if 
 the 
 proposed alternative
 is 
 in the child™s best interests
 ; that is, it 
 would be 
 better for the child
 than continuing the guardian
 ship
 . Note: 
 If t
 he child 
 keeps living with you after turning 
 18, you can get financial help if the child is eligible 
 for 
 Kin GAP or 
 Extended 
 Foster 
 Care
 and you meet 
 other conditions
 . See page 5 for more
 information
 about financial support generally
 . Can 
 the court replace me as
 guardian? 
 Yes. 
 The
 court will consider replacing 
 you as
 guardian if asked by: 
 You, the guardian; 
 Any other interested adult
 ; or
 The child, if 14 years old or older. 
 The judge will 
 replace you 
 only 
 if 
 the situation
 has 
 changed and it
 is 
 in the child™s best interests. 
 How i
 s guardianship 
 different from
 adoption? 
 Both a
 guardian
 and an adoptive parent
 have 
 legal 
 and 
 physical custody of the child
 in place of 
 the 
 birth parents
 . But 
 there are many differences. 
 Permanence. 
 In a guardianship, 
 the parent™s rights 
 are only 
 suspended. 
 The court can end a 
 guardianship and give the parents back their rights if 
 that would be in the child™s best interests. In
 an 
 adoption, 
 parental rights are 
 permanently ended. 
 The adoptive parent is the child™s legal parent. The 
 birth parents cannot
 get th
 eir rights back
 . Visitation. 
 In a guardianship, the court can make an 
 order allowing the parents or other relatives to visit 
 a child. The guardian must obey the visitation order, 
 as well as all other court orders. In an adoption, 
 parents and other relative
 s lose their rights to visit 
 the child unless the court 
 and the adoptive parents 
 agree that
 they can have contact after 
 the 
 adoption. 
 Duration. 
 A guardianship lasts until the child turns 
 18 unless something happens to end the 
 guardianship before then. 
 (A court 
 can 
 order a
 guardianship 
 to end 
 if that is
 in the child™s best 
 interests
 . ) An adoption is intended to last forever. A 
 court can end an adoption
 only 
 by terminating 
 parental rights in a
 new 
 juvenile or family law
 case. 
 Court oversight. 
 The court 
 con
 trols a
 guardianship
 and can make orders, including 
 to replace the 
 guardian or end
 the guardianship, if someone asks 
 and the request is in the child™s best interests. 
 The 
 court does not oversee an adoption once it is final. 
 Inheritance. 
 A child 
 in a guardianship 
 can inherit 
 property 
 from 
 a parent
 if the parent dies without a 
 will
 . If the court knows the child might inherit 
 property, 
 it may appoint a
 ﬁguardian of the estate
 ﬂ to 
 manage the property. 
 An adopted child usually 
 has 
 no right to
 inherit from 
 a birth parent
 , but may 
 receive
 a gift
 from
 a birth parent™s will or trust.

 WHAT ARE A 
 GUARDIAN™S RIGHTS 
 & DUTIES
 ? Subject to the court™s orders, a
 court
 -appointed 
 guardian
 has
 the same
 right
 s to 
 legal and physical custody of the 
 child
 as a parent does
 . In general, you must 
 care for and 
 control
 the child
 the same way a parent would
 . Specifically, 
 that mean
 s: Arrange a place
 for
 the child 
 to live
 If 
 you move the child
 to a 
 new
 address
 in California, 
 you must notify the court 
 in 
 writing
 . To move the 
 child out of California
 , you must get court
 approval 
 first. 
 Use form JV
 -180 to ask the court to approve. 
 Other states have different guardianship laws. If you 
 plan to move to another state, find out about your 
 legal rights and dut
 ies 
 in that state. 
 Arrange 
 for the child™s 
 health 
 care
 You can allow 
 (consent
 to) most medical or dental 
 treatment for the child. But if the child is at least 14 
 years old and does not want to have a non
 -emergency surgery, you must get p
 ermission from 
 the court first. 
 The law also allows older and more mature children 
 to get some medical treatment on their own wi
 thout 
 your approval, including: 
 Outpatient 
 mental health treatment
 ; Reproductive 
 health care
 ; and
 Drug 
 and alcohol treatment. 
 Provide for 
 the child™s 
 education
 You can choose the child™s school and learning 
 programs just as a parent can. In special situations, 
 the court may also be involved in these decisions. 
 Pay attention to how the child does in school
 , and 
 meet with the child
 ™s teachers. If the child needs 
 special education or other specialized services, you 
 can also ask the school or other providers for these 
 services. 
 Access s
 ocial 
 services
 You can get help for the child from 
 other 
 programs, 
 such as: 
 Head Start
 ; Regional centers for 
 persons with 
 developmental 
 delays or disabilities
 ; Health care services
 ; and
 After
 -school care. 
 Give c
 onsent to 
 the child™s 
 marriage
 You can allow the child to marry, but you must get the 
 court™s permission first. 
 Once the child 
 gets married, 
 the guardianship will end. 
 Give c
 onsent to 
 the child™s 
 military service
 You can allow the child to e
 nlist in the U. S. 
 military
 . Once the child enters active duty, the 
 guardianship will 
 end. 
 Give c
 onsent for the child™s 
 driver™s 
 license
 The child 
 cannot
 get a driver™s license
 without your 
 written permission
 . (See 
 your 
 duties 
 described 
 below. ) 
 Pay for h
 arm 
 caused by 
 child™s 
 driving
 You will have to pay for any damage the child causes 
 when driving. The law limits how much 
 money
 you 
 can be forced to pay. 
 If you
 ™re concerned about this 
 duty, you should 
 talk to a lawyer. 
 You must get insurance to cover the child when 
 driving. (The child cannot get a license without your 
 written permission. ) If you change your mind later, 
 you can 
 sign a form at the DMV to cancel the child™s 
 driver™s license. 
 Pay for 
 harm 
 caused by 
 child
 ™s other acts
 Willful 
 misconduct
 . In most cases, a guardian 
 can be 
 made to pay only for harm to another person caused by 
 the child™s 
 willful 
 misconduct. There 
 is usually a limit 
 about how
 much you 
 may need
 to pay. 
 Negligent 
 conduct
 . You 
 can be made to pay for harm 
 caused by the child™s negligent conduct. 
 If you
 ™re 
 concerned about this 
 duty, you should 
 talk to a lawyer. 
 Pay for the child™s needs
 The parents
 are still legally responsible for child
 support, b
 ut you can 
 accept this responsibility. Y
 ou can 
 get 
 money
 to 
 help 
 you 
 support the child. 
 See page 
 5 for more information. 
 Obey all court orders
 The court
 may require you to accept other 
 duties
 . For 
 example, the judge may order you to take the child to 
 visit 
 a parent
 or other relative
 . You must do what the 
 court orders.

 WHAT 
 FINANCIAL HELP
 CAN I RECEIVE? 
 You may be able to get financial help from the 
 county, 
 state, or federal 
 government. The 
 type of 
 help
 depend
 s on the child™s eligibility and 
 their 
 relationship
 to you. 
 Important! 
 Before 
 you become the child™s guardian, ask 
 the child™s social worker
 or probation officer 
 or 
 a lawyer 
 if you will qualify for financial help. 
 If the 
 child 
 is related 
 to 
 you If you become the guardian of a child who is 
 a relative
 , you may 
 qualify for financial help from
 these programs: 
 Kin GAP 
 program
 : If 
 the child has lived with you for 
 at least 
 six months
 after resource family approval
 , you 
 sign
 a written agreement
 , and the court dismisses the 
 case, 
 you 
 can
 qualify for Kin GAP
 payments
 . Kin GAP 
 gives you the same monthly payments 
 as a foster 
 parent caring for a
 foster child
 , including any rate the 
 county m
 ight
 pay
 to care for the child™s 
 special 
 needs
 . You can receive Kin GAP in any county or state, but 
 the amount may change 
 based on 
 where you live
 . In 
 California, the payments are the same amount as foster 
 care payments. 
 Approved Relative Caregiver (ARC) 
 or 
 foster 
 care 
 program: 
 If the court keeps the 
 juvenile 
 case open 
 after appointing you guardian, you 
 can receive ARC or 
 foster 
 care payments
 instead of Kin GAP
