      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Use these Judicial Council forms to ask for an order to give (or to continue giving) psychotropic medication to a child who is a ward or a dependent of the juvenile court and living in an out of home placement or in foster care, as defined in Welfare 
 and Institutions Code section 727. 4. Local forms may be used to provide additional information to the court. Guide to Psychotropic Medication Forms Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov Revised January 1, 2019, Optional Form Welfare and Institutions Code, §§ 369. 5, 739. 5 California Rules of Court, rule 5. 640 Guide to Psychotropic Medication Forms JV 217 INFO, Page 1 of 2 JV 217 INFOException: These forms are not required in these situations: If the child lives in an out of home facility not considered foster care, as defined by section 727. 4, unless a local court rule requires it; orŁ If there is a previous court order that gives the child™s parent (s) or guardian (s) the authority to approve or refuse the medication. Ł Required Forms Optional Forms Application for Psychotropic Medication JV 220 Physician™s StatementŠAttachment JV 220 (A) Physician™s Request to Continue MedicationŠ
 Attachment JV 220 (B) Proof of Notice of Application JV 221 Order on Application for Psychotropic Medication JV 223 County Report on Psychotropic Medication JV 224 The parent, guardian, child, caregiver, CASA, or Indian tribe 
 wanting to give input to the court may use one of these forms: Child™s Opinion About the Medicine JV 218 Statement About Medicine Prescribed JV 219 A person who opposes the proposed medication or who wants 
 to give the court more information may fill out this form: Input on Application for Psychotropic Medication JV 222 Required Forms 1 Form JV 220, Application for Psychotropic 
 Medication This Application gives the court basic information about the child and his/her living situation. It also provides 
 contact information for the child™s social worker or 
 probation officer. This form is usually completed by the social worker or probation officer, but is sometimes completed by the 
 prescribing physician or his/her staff, or the child™s 
 caregiver. Whoever completes the form must identify him/herself by name and by signing the form. If the prescribing physician 
 completes this form, s/he must also complete and sign 
 form JV 220 (A) or form JV 220 (B) . (See below. ) 2 Form JV 220 (A) , Physician™s StatementŠ
 Attachment This form must be used to ask the court for a new order. It can also be used to request to continue medication. The 
 prescribing doctor fills out this form then gives it to the 
 person who files the Application (form JV 220) . This form provides a record of the child™s medical history, 
 diagnosis, previous treatments, and information about the 
 child™s previous experience with psychotropic 
 medications. The doctor will list his/her reasons for 
 recommending the psychotropic medications. Emergencies: A child may not receive psychotropic medication without a court order except in an emergency. A doctor may administer the medication on an emergency 
 basis. For a case to qualify as an emergency, the doctormust find that the child™s mental condition requires 
 immediate medication to protect him/her or others from 
 serious harm or significant suffering, and that waiting for 
 the court™s authorization would put the child or others at 
 risk. After a doctor administers emergency medication, 
 s/he has two days at most to ask for the court™s 
 authorization. 3 Form JV 220 (B) , Physician™s Request to Continue 
 MedicationŠAttachment This is a shorter version of form JV 220 (A) . It may be used 
 only by the same doctor who filled out the most recent 
 form JV 220 (A) if s/he is prescribing the same medication 
 with the same maximum dosage. The prescribing doctor 
 fills out this form then gives it to the person who is filing 
 the Application (form JV 220) . 4 Form JV 221, Proof of Notice of Application This form shows the court that all parties with a right to 
 receive notice were served a copy of the Application and attachments, according to rule 5. 640 of California Rules of 
 Court. The person (s) in charge of notice must fill out and sign this form. A separate signature line is provided on each page of 
 the form to accommodate those courts in which the 
 provision of notice is shared between agencies. This occurs 
 when local practices or local court rules require the child 
 welfare services agency to provide notice to the parent or 
 legal guardian and the caregiver, and the juvenile court 
 clerk™s office to provide notice to the attorneys and CASA JV 217 INFO, Page 2 of 2 Guide to Psychotropic Medication Forms Rev. January 1, 2019 Guide to Psychotropic Medication Forms JV 217 INFOvolunteer. If one agency does all the required noticing, only one signature is required on page 3 of the form. The 
 person (s) in charge of service should use the fastest 
 method of service available so that people can be served 
 on time. Electronic service of these forms is not permitted. 
 (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 212. 5) 5 Form JV 223, Order on Application for Psychotropic 
 Medication This form lists the court™s findings and orders about the 
 child™s psychotropic medications. The agency or person 
 who filed the Application must provide the child™s caregiver a copy of the court order approving or denying 
 the Application. The copy of the order must be provided (in person or by 
 mail) within two days of when the order is made. If the court approves the Application, the copy of the order must include the last two pages of form JV 220 (A) or JV- 220 (B) , and all of the medication information sheets 
 (medication monographs) that were attached to form 
 JV 220 (A) or JV 220 (B) . If the child™s placement is changed, the social worker or probation officer must provide the new caregiver with a 
 copy of the order, the last two pages of form JV 220 (A) or 
 JV 220 (B) , and all of the medication information sheets 
 (medication monographs) that were attached to form 
 JV 220 (A) or JV 220 (B) . 6 Form JV 224, County Report on Psychotropic 
 Medication The social worker or probation officer must complete and 
 file this form before each progress review. It has 
 information that the court must review, including the 
 caregiver™s and child™s observations about the medicine™s 
 effectiveness and side effects, information on medication 
 management appointments and other follow up 
 appointments with medical practitioners, and information 
 on the delivery of other mental health treatments. This form must be filed at least 10 calendar days before the progress review hearing. If the progress review is 
 scheduled for the same time as a status review hearing, the 
 form must be attached to and filed with the court report. This form may be used when the parent or guardian, 
 attorney of record for a parent or guardian, child, child™s 
 attorney, child™s CAPTA guardian ad litem, or Indian 
 child™s tribe does not agree that the child should take the 
 recommended psychotropic medication. This form may 
 also be used to provide input to the court. Within four court days of service of notice of the pending application regarding psychotropic medication, the parent 
 or guardian, his or her attorney, the child, the child™s 
 attorney, the child™s CAPTA guardian ad litem, or the 
 Indian child™s tribe that disagrees must complete, sign, 
 and file form JV 222 with the clerk of the juvenile court. The court will make a decision about the child™s psychotropic medication after reading the Application, its attachments, and all statements filed on time. The court is 
 not required to set a hearing if a statement opposed to 
 medication is filed. If the court does set the matter for a hearing, the juvenile court clerk must provide notice of the date, time, and 
 location of the hearing to the parents or legal guardians, 
 their attorneys, the child if 12 years of age or older, the 
 child™s attorney, the child™s current caregiver, the child™s 
 social worker, the social worker™s attorney, the child™s 
 CAPTA guardian ad litem, the child™s CASA, if any, and 
 the Indian child™s tribe at least two court days before the 
 hearing date. In delinquency matters, the clerk also must 
 provide notice to the child regardless of his or her age, the 
 child™s probation officer, and the district attorney. 7 Form JV 218, Child™s Opinion About the Medicine Optional Forms The child may use this form to tell the judge about him/
 herself and his/her opinion about the medicine. The child may ask someone s/he trusts for help with the form. The child may also tell the judge how s/he feels in person at the hearing, by letter, or through his social worker, 
 probation officer, lawyer, or CASA. 8 Form JV 219, Statement About Medicine Prescribed The parent, guardian, caregiver, CASA, or Indian tribe 
 may use this form to tell the court how they feel about the 
 Application, and the effectiveness and side effects of the medicine. This form must be filed within four court days of receipt of the notice of an Application, or before any status review hearing or medication progress review hearing. This form is not the only way for the parent, guardian, caregiver, CASA, or tribe to provide information to the 
 court. They can also provide input on the medication by 
 letter; by talking to the judge at the court hearing; or 
 through the social worker, probation officer, attorney of 
 record, or CASA. A CASA can also file a report under 
 local rule. 9 Form JV 222, Input on Application for Psychotropic
