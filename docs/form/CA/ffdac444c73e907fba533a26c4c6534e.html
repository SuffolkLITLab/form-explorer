Guide to Psychotropic Medication Forms

Use these Judicial Council forms to ask for an order to give (or to continue giving) psychotropic medication to a child who is 
a ward or a dependent of the juvenile court and living in an out-of-home placement or in foster care, as defined in Welfare 
and Institutions Code section 727.4. Local forms may be used to provide additional information to the court.

Exception: These forms are not required in these situations:
• 

If the child lives in an out-of-home facility not considered foster care, as defined by section 727.4, unless a local court rule 
requires it; or
If there is a previous court order that gives the child’s parent(s) or guardian(s) the authority to approve or refuse the 
medication.

Input on Application for Psychotropic Medication

Required Forms
1 Form JV-220, Application for Psychotropic 

Medication
This Application gives the court basic information about 
the child and his/her living situation. It also provides 
contact information for the child’s social worker or 
probation officer.  
This form is usually completed by the social worker or 
probation officer, but is sometimes completed by the 
prescribing physician or his/her staff, or the child’s 
caregiver.  
Whoever completes the form must identify him/herself by 
name and by signing the form. If the prescribing physician 
completes this form, s/he must also complete and sign 
form JV-220(A) or form JV-220(B). (See below.)

2 Form JV-220(A), Physician’s Statement—

Attachment
This form must be used to ask the court for a new order. It 
can also be used to request to continue medication. The 
prescribing doctor fills out this form then gives it to the 
person who files the Application (form JV-220).  
This form provides a record of the child’s medical history, 
diagnosis, previous treatments, and information about the 
child’s previous experience with psychotropic 
medications. The doctor will list his/her reasons for 
recommending the psychotropic medications.  
Emergencies: A child may not receive psychotropic 
medication without a court order except in an emergency. 
A doctor may administer the medication on an emergency 
basis. For a case to qualify as an emergency, the doctor

Judicial Council of California, www.courts.ca.gov 
Revised January 1, 2019, Optional Form 
Welfare and Institutions Code, §§ 369.5, 739.5 
California Rules of Court, rule 5.640

must find that the child’s mental condition requires 
immediate medication to protect him/her or others from 
serious harm or significant suffering, and that waiting for 
the court’s authorization would put the child or others at 
risk. After a doctor administers emergency medication,  
s/he has two days at most to ask for the court’s 
authorization. 

3 Form JV-220(B), Physician’s Request to Continue 

Medication—Attachment
This is a shorter version of form JV-220(A). It may be used 
only by the same doctor who filled out the most recent 
form JV-220(A) if s/he is prescribing the same medication 
with the same maximum dosage. The prescribing doctor 
fills out this form then gives it to the person who is filing 
the Application (form JV-220). 

4 Form JV-221, Proof of Notice of Application

This form shows the court that all parties with a right to 
receive notice were served a copy of the Application and 
attachments, according to rule 5.640 of California Rules of 
Court. 
The person(s) in charge of notice must fill out and sign this 
form. A separate signature line is provided on each page of 
the form to accommodate those courts in which the 
provision of notice is shared between agencies. This occurs 
when local practices or local court rules require the child 
welfare services agency to provide notice to the parent or 
legal guardian and the caregiver, and the juvenile court 
clerk’s office to provide notice to the attorneys and CASA

volunteer. If one agency does all the required noticing, 
only one signature is required on page 3 of the form. The 
person(s) in charge of service should use the fastest 
method of service available so that people can be served 
on time. Electronic service of these forms is not permitted. 
(Welf. & Inst. Code, § 212.5)

5 Form JV-223, Order on Application for Psychotropic 

Medication
This form lists the court’s findings and orders about the 
child’s psychotropic medications. The agency or person 
who filed the Application must provide the child’s 
caregiver a copy of the court order approving or denying 
the Application. 
The copy of the order must be provided (in person or by 
mail) within two days of when the order is made.  
If the court approves the Application, the copy of the order 
must include the last two pages of form JV-220(A) or  
JV- 220(B), and all of the medication information sheets 
(medication monographs) that were attached to form 
JV-220(A) or JV-220(B). 
If the child’s placement is changed, the social worker or 
probation officer must provide the new caregiver with a 
copy of the order, the last two pages of form JV-220(A) or 
JV-220(B), and all of the medication information sheets 
(medication monographs) that were attached to form 
JV-220(A) or JV-220(B).

6 Form JV-224, County Report on Psychotropic 

Medication
The social worker or probation officer must complete and 
file this form before each progress review. It has 
information that the court must review, including the 
caregiver’s and child’s observations about the medicine’s 
effectiveness and side effects, information on medication 
management appointments and other follow-up 
appointments with medical practitioners, and information 
on the delivery of other mental health treatments.  
This form must be filed at least 10 calendar days before 
the progress review hearing. If the progress review is 
scheduled for the same time as a status review hearing, the 
form must be attached to and filed with the court report.

Optional Forms
7 Form JV-218, Child’s Opinion About the Medicine
The child may use this form to tell the judge about him/
herself and his/her opinion about the medicine.  
The child may ask someone s/he trusts for help with the 
form.  
The child may also tell the judge how s/he feels in person 
at the hearing, by letter, or through his social worker, 
probation officer, lawyer, or CASA.

8 Form JV-219, Statement About Medicine Prescribed
The parent, guardian, caregiver, CASA, or Indian tribe 
may use this form to tell the court how they feel about the 
Application, and the effectiveness and side effects of the 
medicine. 
This form must be filed within four court days of receipt 
of the notice of an Application, or before any status review 
hearing or medication progress review hearing. 
This form is not the only way for the parent, guardian, 
caregiver, CASA, or tribe to provide information to the 
court. They can also provide input on the medication by 
letter; by talking to the judge at the court hearing; or 
through the social worker, probation officer, attorney of 
record, or CASA. A CASA can also file a report under 
local rule.

9 Form JV-222, Input on Application for Psychotropic 

Medication
This form may be used when the parent or guardian, 
attorney of record for a parent or guardian, child, child’s 
attorney, child’s CAPTA guardian ad litem, or Indian 
child’s tribe does not agree that the child should take the 
recommended psychotropic medication. This form may 
also be used to provide input to the court. 
Within four court days of service of notice of the pending 
application regarding psychotropic medication, the parent 
or guardian, his or her attorney, the child, the child’s 
attorney, the child’s CAPTA guardian ad litem, or the 
Indian child’s tribe that disagrees must complete, sign, 
and file form JV-222 with the clerk of the juvenile court. 
The court will make a decision about the child’s 
psychotropic medication after reading the Application, its 
attachments, and all statements filed on time. The court is 
not required to set a hearing if a statement opposed to 
medication is filed.  
If the court does set the matter for a hearing, the juvenile 
court clerk must provide notice of the date, time, and 
location of the hearing to the parents or legal guardians, 
their attorneys, the child if 12 years of age or older, the 
child’s attorney, the child’s current caregiver, the child’s 
social worker, the social worker’s attorney, the child’s 
CAPTA guardian ad litem, the child’s CASA, if any, and 
the Indian child’s tribe at least two court days before the 
hearing date. In delinquency matters, the clerk also must 
provide notice to the child regardless of his or her age, the 
child’s probation officer, and the district attorney.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
