 Obey child custody and visitation orders
 Pay child support
 
 Pay spousal support
 Obey orders about property 
 Ł Ł Ł How will the restraining order help me? The court can order the restrained person to: 
 Not contact or go near you, your children, other
 relatives, or others who live with you
 
 Not have any guns
 or ammunition Move out of your house
 Ł Ł Ł The forms are available at 
 any California courthouse or 
 county law library or at: 
 www. courts. ca. gov/forms. How do I ask for a domestic violence restraining order? You may get assistance in co
 mpleting and filing your request from the court™s self help center or a legal aid 
 
 association. After completing the forms, gi
 ve them to the clerk of the 
 court. The clerk will write a hearing date on the 
 Notice of Court Hearing (Form DV 109) . If your request for 
 temporary orders is granted, the clerk will also give you a 
 copy of the 
 Temporary Restraining Order (DV 110) 
 signed by a judicial officer. How soon can I get the order? The judge will decide within one business day whether 
 or not to make any temporary orders. Sometimes the 
 
 judge decides sooner. Ask the 
 clerk if you should wait or 
 come back later to get copies of the 
 Notice of Court Hearing 
 (Form DV 109) and 
 Temporary Restraining 
 Order 
 (Form DV 110) . 
 Ask the court clerk for the form
 s you need for these special 
 kinds of orders, or visit 
 www. courts. ca. gov. You may also 
 want to talk to a lawyer. 
 What is abuse? Ł Abuse means to intentionally or recklessly cause or 
 attempt to cause bodily injury 
 to you; or sexually assault 
 you; or to place you or anothe
 r person in reasonable fear 
 of imminent serious bodily injury; or to molest, attack, 
 hit, stalk, threaten, batter, 
 harass, telephone, or contact 
 you; or to disturb your peace
 ; or destroy your personal 
 property. Abuse can be spoken, written, or physical. (See 
 Family Code §§ 6203, 6320) . 
 See Form DV 505 INFO, How Do I Ask for a Temporary 
 Restraining Order? to know which forms you need and for 
 steps to follow after you complete the forms. 
 Ł DV 500 INFOWhat if I don™t have the relationship necessary to qualify for a domestic violence

 Civil harassment order (can be used for neighbors, 
 roommates, cousins, uncles, and aunts) 
 Dependent adult or elder abuse restraining order
 Workplace violence order
 Ł 
 Ł 
 Ł 
 Having a lawyer is always a good idea, especially if you 
 have children, but it is not required. You are not entitled to 
 a free court appointed lawyer
 . Ask the court clerk about 
 free and low cost legal serv
 ices and domestic violence help centers in your county
 . You can also go to the 
 Family Law Facilitator for 
 help with child support. 
 Do I need to bring a witness to the court hearing? Do I need a lawyer? No. But it helps to have pr

 bring: 
 
 A written statement from a witness, made under oath 
 Witnesses

 not you or anyone
 else to be protected by the orderŠmust ﬁserveﬂ (give) 
 the person to be restrained a

 person can be arrested and charged with a crime. 
 What if the restrained person doesn't obeythe order? Yes. Go to court on the date the clerk gives you. 
 If you do not, your order will end. 
 Do I have to go to court? Will I see the restrained person at the court hearing? 
 If the restrained person come
 s to the hearing, yes. But 
 that person does not have the right to speak to you. If 
 you are afraid, tell the court officer. Read 
 Get Ready for 
 the Court Hearing
 (Form DV 520 INFO) . Yes. You can bring someone to sit with you during the 
 court hearing. But that pers

 court. Only you or your lawyer (if you have one) can 
 speak for you. 
 Can I bring someone with me to court? When you file your papers, ask the clerk if a court

 Can a Domestic Violence Restraining Order Help Me? (Domestic Violence Prevention) 
 Revised January 1, 2012
 The judge may or may not 
 let a witness speak at the hearing. 
 So if possible, you should 
 bring their written statement 
 under oath to the hearing. 
 (You can use Form MC 030, 
 Declaration
 , for this purpose. ) If the judge makes a temporary order, it will last until the 
 hearing date. At that time, the judge will decide to 
 continue or cancel the order. 
 The restraining order can last 
 up to 5 years. Child custody, 
 visitation, child support, and 
 spousal support orders can l
 ast longer than 5 years and 
 they do not end when the restraining order ends. 
 How long does the order last? Can I use the restraining order to get divorced or terminate a registered 
 domestic partnership? No. These forms will not end your marriage or 
 registered domestic partnership. You must file other 
 
 forms to end your marriage or registered domestic 
 partnership. If you get a temporary restrain
 ing order that includes an 
 order for custody, the parent with custody may not 
 remove the child from California before notice to the 
 other parent and a court hearing on the request to 
 establish or modify custody. 
 Read the order and Form 
 DV 140, Child Custody and Visitation Order
 , if issued, 
 for any other limits. There are some exceptions. Ask a 
 lawyer. The restraining order is vali
 d anywhere in the United 
 States. If you move out of California, contact the local 
 
 police so they will know about your orders. 
 Ask the court clerk about free or low cost legal help. 
 For a referral to a local domestic violence or legal 
 assistance program, call the National Domestic 
 Violence Hotline: 
 1 800 799 7233
 TDD: 1 800 787 3224 
 It™s free and private. 
 They can help you in more than 100 languages. 
 Can the order stop the other parent from taking our children away? What if I want to leave the county or state? Need more information? 
 DV 500 INFOCan a Domestic Violence R
 estraining Order Help Me? No. After the order is issued
 , only the judg
 e can change 
 or cancel it. Can the restrained person and I agree tocancel the order? DV 500 INFO,

 What if I am deaf or hard of hearing? Assistive listening systems, computer- 
 assisted real time captioning, or sign

 you ask at least five days before the 
 
 proceeding. Contact the
