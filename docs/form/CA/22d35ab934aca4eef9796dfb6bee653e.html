Can a Domestic Violence Restraining Order Help Me?

What is a “domestic violence restraining
order”?
It is a court order that can help protect people who have 
been abused by someone they've had an intimate 
relationship with, are closely related to, or have lived with 
as more than just roommates.

How soon can I get the order? 

If you decide to ask for a restraining order, you will 
need to complete court papers. Once you turn in your 
court papers, a judge will decide the same day or next 
business day on whether to grant you a temporary 
restraining order. 

How can a restraining order help me?

How old must I be to ask for one?

A judge can order the restrained person to:
•  Not contact you, your children or relatives, or people 

you live with;

•  Stay away from you, your children or relatives, or 
people you live with, your home, your job, etc.;

•  Not have any firearms (guns, including "ghost guns"), 

firearm parts, or ammunition; 

•  Move out of a home that you live in;

•  Obey child custody and visitation orders;

•  Pay child support;

•  Pay spousal support; 

•  Pay debt for property; and

•  Give you control of property (examples: cell phone, 

car, home). 

Does this request cost money to file?

No, filing this request with the court is free.

How long can a restraining order last?
If the judge makes a temporary order, it will last until 
your hearing date (court date). Your hearing is usually 
three weeks after you turn in your court papers. At your 
hearing, the judge will decide whether to grant you a 
long-term restraining order that can last up to five years. 

To ask for a restraining order on your own, you must 
be 12 years old or older. In some cases, the judge may 
ask that an adult (someone 18 years old or older), like 
a trusted relative, help you in your case.

What if I don’t have a green card?

You can get a restraining order even if you are not a 
U.S. citizen. If you are worried about deportation, you 
may want to talk with an immigration lawyer.

Can a restraining order protect my 
children?
Yes, you can ask the judge to protect your children. If 
you are asking for a restraining order against someone 
you have children with, you can also ask the judge to 
make child custody and visitation orders. And if you 
think that the other parent might abduct (kidnap) your 
children, you can ask for orders to prevent kidnapping.  
 

Can I use a restraining order to get 
divorced or terminate a registered 
domestic partnership?

No. These forms will not end your marriage or 
registered domestic partnership. You must file other 
forms to end your marriage or registered domestic 
partnership.

(Domestic Violence Prevention)

DV-500-INFO

Can a Domestic Violence Restraining Order Help Me?

Am I eligible?
To qualify for a domestic violence restraining order, you 
must have a (1) required relationship and (2) show that 
the person you want a restraining order against has been 
abusive.

Required relationship
•  Your spouse, ex-spouse, registered domestic 
partner, or ex-registered domestic partner;

•  Someone you have a child with;  
•  Your parent, child, sibling, or grandparent 
(includes in-laws and step relationships);

•  Someone you live with or used to live with (more 

than just roommates); 

Abuse

Abuse can be spoken, written, or physical. It can be 
physical, sexual, or emotional. It includes threats to 
harm you or your family, stalking, harassment, 
destroying personal property, repeated contact, and 
disturbing the peace.   

What does disturbing the peace mean?  

It means to destroy someone's mental or emotional 
calm. Disturbing the peace includes coercive 
control. Coercive control means a number of acts 
that unreasonably limit the free will and individual 
rights of any person. Examples include:
•  Isolating someone from their friends, 

relatives, or other support;

•  Keeping them from food or basic needs;
•  Controlling or keeping track of them, 

including their movements, contacts, actions, 
money, or access to services;

•  Threats to immigration status;

•  Making them do something that they don't 

want to do; and

•  Controlling or interfering with someone's 
contraception (birth control, condoms); 
pregnancy or ability to become a parent; or 
access to health information.

What if I don’t qualify for a domestic 
violence restraining order?

There are other kinds of restraining orders you can ask 
for. Here are some examples:
•  Civil harassment order (can be used for neighbors,

roommates, cousins, uncles, and aunts).

•  Dependent adult or elder abuse restraining order (if 

you are at least 65 or a dependent adult).

•  Gun violence restraining order (to prevent someone 
from hurting themselves or others with a firearm).

Note that all restraining orders include a firearms and 
ammunition restriction. A gun violence restraining 
order gives limited protection because it only restrains 
the person from having firearms and ammunition. To 
learn more about other kinds of restraining orders, go 
to: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/restraining-orders.

How do I ask for a domestic violence 
restraining order?
See form DV-505-INFO, How to Ask for a Domestic 
Violence Restraining Order. The forms are available 
online at www.courts.ca.gov/forms. If you want a paper 
copy, go to any California courthouse. You can also 
check with your county's law library.

Will I have a court hearing (court date)?

Yes. The court will give you a day and time to attend 
court. If you want to attend court remotely (by phone or 
videoconference), go to the court's website to find out 
how to attend remotely. To learn more about what to 
expect at your hearing, read form DV-520-INFO, Get 
Ready for Your Restraining Order Court Hearing, or go 
to: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/prepare-your-
restraining-order-court-date.

Can a Domestic Violence Restraining Order Help Me?

Do I need a lawyer to make this request?
No, but this type of request can be hard to get through 
on your own. Free help may be available at your local 
court's self-help center. (See below.) 

Where can I find a self-help center?
Find your local court's self-help center at  
www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp. Self-help center staff 
will not act as your lawyer but may be able to give 
you information to help you decide what to do in 
your case, and help you with the forms. 

Confidential Address Program
If you are a victim of domestic violence or live with a 
victim of domestic violence, there is a special program 
called  Safe At Home that you can apply for. It is a free 
program that would help you keep your address private. 
To learn more about the program, go to: 
https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/safe-home/. 
Note that it may take several weeks to be approved.
