      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: DISC 001 Each answer must be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to you, including the 
 information possessed by your attorneys or agents, permits. 
 If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, answer it 
 to the extent possible. Sec. 1. Instructions to All Parties Interrogatories are written questions prepared by a party to an 
 action that are sent to any other party in the action to be 
 answered under oath. The interrogatories below are form 
 interrogatories approved for use in civil cases. For time limitations, requirements for service on other parties, and other details, see Code of Civil Procedure sections 
 2030. 010Œ2030. 410 and the cases construing those sections. If you do not have enough personal knowledge to fully 
 answer an interrogatory, say so, but make a reasonable and 
 good faith effort to get the information by asking other persons or organizations, unless the information is equally available to the asking party. These form interrogatories do not change existing law 
 relating to interrogatories nor do they affect an answering party™s right to assert any privilege or make any objection. Whenever an interrogatory may be answered by referring to a document, the document may be attached as an exhibit to 
 the response and referred to in the response. If the 
 document has more than one page, refer to the page and 
 section where the answer to the interrogatory can be found. Sec. 2. Instructions to the Asking Party These interrogatories are designed for optional use by parties 
 in unlimited civil cases where the amount demanded exceeds $25, 000. Separate interrogatories, Form InterrogatoriesŠLimited Civil Cases (Economic Litigation) (form DISC 004) , which have no subparts, are designed for use in limited civil cases where the amount demanded is $25, 000 or less; 
 however, those interrogatories may also be used in unlimited 
 civil cases. Whenever an address and telephone number for the same 
 person are requested in more than one interrogatory, you 
 are required to furnish them in answering only the first 
 interrogatory asking for that information. If you are asserting a privilege or making an objection to an interrogatory, you must specifically assert the privilege or 
 state the objection in your written response. Check the box next to each interrogatory that you want the 
 answering party to answer. Use care in choosing those 
 interrogatories that are applicable to the case. Your answers to these interrogatories must be verified, 
 dated, and signed. You may wish to use the following form 
 at the end of your answers: You may insert your own definition of INCIDENT in Section 4, but only where the action arises from a course of conduct or a 
 series of events occurring over a period of time. I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of 
 California that the foregoing answers are true and correct. The interrogatories in section 16. 0, Defendant™s ContentionsŒ
 Personal Injury, should not be used until the defendant has 
 had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an investigation or discovery of plaintiff™s injuries and damages. (SIGNATURE) Additional interrogatories may be attached. Sec. 4. Definitions Sec. 3. Instructions to the Answering Party Words in BOLDFACE CAPITALS in these interrogatories are defined as follows: An answer or other appropriate response must be given to each interrogatory checked by the asking party. (a) (Check one of the following) : As a general rule, within 30 days after you are served with these interrogatories, you must serve your responses on the 
 asking party and serve copies of your responses on all other 
 parties to the action who have appeared. See Code of Civil 
 Procedure sections 2030. 260Œ2030. 270 for details.
