CASE NUMBER:

Sec. 1. Instructions to All Parties
(a)   Interrogatories are written questions prepared by a party  

to an action that are sent to any other party in the action to be  
answered under oath. The interrogatories below are form  
interrogatories approved for use in civil cases.

(b)   For time limitations, requirements for service on other   
parties, and other details, see Code of Civil Procedure  
sections 2030.010–2030.410 and the cases construing those  
sections.

(c)   These form interrogatories do not change existing law  

relating to interrogatories nor do they affect an answering  
party’s right to assert any privilege or make any objection.

Sec. 2. Instructions to the Asking Party
(a)   These interrogatories are designed for optional use by  

parties in unlimited civil cases where the amount demanded 
exceeds $25,000. Separate interrogatories, Form 
Interrogatories—Limited Civil Cases (Economic Litigation) 
(form DISC-004), which have no subparts, are designed for 
use in limited civil cases where the amount demanded is 
$25,000 or less; however, those interrogatories may also be 
used in unlimited civil cases.

(b)   Check the box next to each interrogatory that you want  

the answering party to answer. Use care in choosing those  
interrogatories that are applicable to the case.
(c)   You may insert your own definition of INCIDENT in  

Section 4, but only where the action arises from a course of 
conduct or a series of events occurring over a period of time.

(d)   The interrogatories in section 16.0, Defendant’s  

Contentions–Personal Injury, should not be used until the 
defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an 
investigation or discovery of plaintiff’s injuries and damages.

(e)   Additional interrogatories may be attached.

Sec. 3. Instructions to the Answering Party
(a)   An answer or other appropriate response must be   

given to each interrogatory checked by the asking party.
(b)   As a general rule, within 30 days after you are served   

with these interrogatories, you must serve your responses on  
the asking party and serve copies of your responses on all  
other parties to the action who have appeared. See Code of  
Civil Procedure sections 2030.260–2030.270 for details.

(c)   Each answer must be as complete and straightforward  

as the information reasonably available to you, including the  
information possessed by your attorneys or agents, permits. If 
an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, answer it to 
the extent possible.

(d)   If you do not have enough personal knowledge to fully  

answer an interrogatory, say so, but make a reasonable and  
good faith effort to get the information by asking other persons 
or organizations, unless the information is equally available to 
the asking party.

(e)   Whenever an interrogatory may be answered by  

referring to a document, the document may be attached as an 
exhibit to the response and referred to in the response. If the  
document has more than one page, refer to the page and  
section where the answer to the interrogatory can be found.

(f)    Whenever an address and telephone number for the  

same person are requested in more than one interrogatory, 
you are required to furnish them in answering only the first  
interrogatory asking for that information.

(g)   If you are asserting a privilege or making an objection to  

an interrogatory, you must specifically assert the privilege or  
state the objection in your written response.

(h)   Your answers to these interrogatories must be verified,  

dated, and signed. You may wish to use the following form at 
the end of your answers:

       I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the  
State of California that the foregoing answers are true and
