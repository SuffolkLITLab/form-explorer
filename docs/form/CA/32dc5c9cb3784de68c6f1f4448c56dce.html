What it means to be an emancipated 
minor
If you are under the age of 18 years and have an order 
allowing you to marry or register a domestic 
partnership, you are considered to be an emancipated 
minor when you have entered into a valid marriage or 
domestic partnership.

When you are emancipated, you are no longer under 
the care and control of your parents or legal guardian. If 
you are a dependent or ward of the juvenile court, your 
legal status also changes when you are emancipated. 
This affects certain rights relating to you and your 
parents or legal guardians. For example:  

You give up the right to financial support from your 
parents or legal guardians.

Your parents or legal guardians lose the right to 
control your finances, and they are no longer required 
to support you.

3

Rights of an emancipated minor
As specified in Family Code sections 7050 
through 7052, as an emancipated minor you have 
the right to:

Decide where you want to live;

Enroll yourself in school;
Apply for a work permit;

Make or revoke a will;
Keep the money you earn;

Decide how to spend the money you earn;
Enter into contracts, get a bank loan or credit card;

File a lawsuit or be sued in your own name;  
Consent to your own medical, dental, and 
psychiatric care; and
Buy, sell, lease, exchange, or transfer any 
interest you have in real estate or personal 
property.

Case Number:

Rights of unemancipated minors  
A minor who is 12 years or older may file for a 
domestic violence restraining order in the minor's 
own name.
A minor may consent to the matters provided in 
Family Code sections 6920 to 6930, subject to 
certain limitations, and the consent of the minor's 
parent or legal guardian is not necessary. For 
example:

Mental health treatment, outpatient counseling, 
emergency residential shelter service

A minor who is 12 years of age or older may 
consent to mental health treatment or counseling on 
an outpatient basis, or to residential shelter services 
or other supportive services on a temporary or 
emergency basis. Both of the following 
requirements must be satisfied:

(1) 

(2) 

The minor, in the opinion of the attending 
professional person, is mature enough to 
participate intelligently in the outpatient 
services or residential shelter services.

The minor (A) would present a danger of 
physical or mental harm to self or to others 
without the mental health treatment or 
counseling or residential shelter services, or  
(B) is the alleged victim of incest or child  
abuse.

Other rights

(1)

A minor who is 12 years of age or older may 
consent to medical care and counseling relating 
to the diagnosis and treatment of a drug- or 
alcohol-related problem, prevention of a 
sexually transmitted disease, or prevention or 
treatment of pregnancy.

(2)  A minor may make a contract in the same 

manner as an adult. However, the contract can 
be disaffirmed if the law so permits. 

(3)

Minors may never (A) give a delegation of 
power (B) contract relating to real property, or  
(C) contract relating to personal property not 
within the minor's immediate possession or 
control.

4

Other rights of an emancipated minor
With respect to shares of stock in a domestic or foreign 
corporation, a membership in a nonprofit corporation, or 
other property held by an emancipated minor, you may 
do all of the following:

7

Vote in person, and give proxies to exercise any voting 
rights, with respect to the shares, membership, or  
property;

Waive notice of any meeting or give consent to the 
holding of any meeting; and 

Authorize, ratify, approve, and affirm any action that 
could be taken by shareholders, members, or property 
owners.

5

Limits on the rights of an 
emancipated minor
Even if you have been declared an emancipated minor: 

You must still attend school as required by law.

If you are charged with a crime, your case will be in the 
Juvenile Court.  

Labor laws relating to minors still apply to you and 
prevent you from performing dangerous  kinds of work. 

You must still meet the age requirements in California 
for obtaining a driver's license.

You cannot consent to sexual intercourse with anyone 
who is not your legal spouse or domestic partner. This 
means that any other adult who has sex with an 
emancipated minor can still be prosecuted for unlawful 
sexual intercourse with a minor.

6 Alternatives to emancipation 

As an alternative to emancipation, you can consider: 

Family counseling to help improve your relationship 
with your parents while living with them.

Obtaining an order to make someone you trust your legal 
guardian until you become 18 years old.

Getting help from public or private agencies in your area.

Making an informal agreement with your parents that 
allows you to live with someone else. Note: The law 
allows the caregiver to enroll you in school and obtain 
basic medical care for you by completing a Caregiver's 
Authorization Affidavit, even if the caregiver does not 
have a court order for child custody. The affidavit can be 
found online at http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/

Case Number:

partnership, or both
Dissolution (Divorce): A divorce judgment ends your 
marriage or domestic partnership, or both. You will be 
legally a single person again. In a divorce case you can 
ask the judge to make orders about parenting issues, 
child support, spousal or partner support, and dividing 
property and debts.

Legal Separation: A legal separation does not end a 
marriage or domestic partnership. A couple may 
decide to file for legal separation instead of a divorce 
for religious reasons, financial reasons, or because 
they just want to live apart and have court orders about 
money, property, and parenting issues.

For information about divorce and legal separation, 
including the procedures for filing in family court go 
to www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-divorce.htm.

Read Legal Steps for a Divorce or Legal Separation  
(form FL-107-INFO). This form can be found online 
at www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl107info.pdf.

Summary Dissolution: This type of action is available 
for couples who have been married or domestic 
partners for less than five years, do not have children 
together, do not seek an order for support, do not own 
real estate or land, and have limited debts and 
property. For more information, go to:

http://www.courts.ca.gov/1241.htm;

domestic partnership   
The law describes circumstances in which a 
marriage or domestic partnership is void (not 
legally valid) from the very beginning.

Bigamous relationship: One or both people are 
already married to (or in a registered domestic 
partnership with) someone else. For more 
information, see Family Code section 2201.

Incestuous relationship: This is a marriage or  
partnership between two people who are close blood 
relatives. See Family Code section 2200.

or domestic partnership   
Family Code section 2210 describes circumstances 
in which a marriage or domestic partnership can  
be declared invalid (or voidable). The following  
must have taken place at the time the parties married 
or registered the domestic partnership:
Under age: The person filing for annulment was 
under 18 years old. 

Unsound mind: Either party was unable to 
understand the nature of the marriage or domestic 
partnership, including the obligations that come 
with it.
Fraud: Either party decided to marry or register the 
domestic partnership as a result of fraud. The party 
was deceived about something vital to the 
relationship that directly affected the decision to 
marry or become a domestic partner. Some 
examples are hiding the inability to have children or 
just wanting to get a green card.

Force: Either party was forced to consent. 

Physical incapacity: One of the parties was 
physically incapable of "consummating" the 
relationship (having sexual intercourse) and the 
incapacity appears to be "incurable."

Prior existing marriage or domestic partnership:  
The marriage or domestic partnership took place 
after the former spouse or domestic partner was 
absent for five years and not known to be living, or 
was thought to be dead.  

Note: See Family Code section 2211 for the time 
limits for filing to nullify a voidable legal relationship.
