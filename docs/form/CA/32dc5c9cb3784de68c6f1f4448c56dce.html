 allowing you to marry or register a domestic 
 partnership, you are considered to be an emancipated 
 minor when you have entered into a valid marriage or 
 domestic partnership. When you are emancipated, you are no longer under 
 the care and control of your parents or legal guardian. If 
 you are a dependent or ward of the juvenile court, your 
 legal status also changes when you are emancipated. 
 This affects certain rights relating to you and your 
 parents or legal guardians. For example: You give up the right to financial support from your 
 parents or legal guardians. Ł Your parents or legal guardians lose the right to 
 control your finances, and they are no longer required 
 to support you. Ł Decide where you want to live; Enter into contracts, get a bank loan or credit card; Apply for a work permit; Enroll yourself in school; File a lawsuit or be sued in your own name; Consent to your own medical, dental, and psychiatric care; and Make or revoke a will; Keep the money you earn; Buy, sell, lease, exchange, or transfer any interest you have in real estate or personal 
 property. As specified in Family Code sections 7050 
 through 7052, as an emancipated minor you have 
 the right to: Rights of an emancipated minor 3 Decide how to spend the money you earn; Order and Notices to Minor on Request to Marry or Establish a Domestic Partnership Revised January 1, 2020 Case Number: ŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁ Ł Ł Ł Ł Ł FL 915, Page 4 of 5 Revised January 1, 2020 Other rights of an emancipated minor 4 With respect to shares of stock in a domestic or foreign corporation, a membership in a nonprofit corporation, or 
 other property held by an emancipated minor, you may 
 do all of the following: Waive notice of any meeting or give consent to the 
 holding of any meeting; and Authorize, ratify, approve, and affirm any action that could be taken by shareholders, members, or property 
 owners. Vote in person, and give proxies to exercise any voting rights, with respect to the shares, membership, or 
 property; Limits on the rights of an 
 emancipated minor Even if you have been declared an emancipated minor: If you are charged with a crime, your case will be in the 
 Juvenile Court. You must still attend school as required by law. Labor laws relating to minors still apply to you and prevent you from performing dangerous kinds of work. You must still meet the age requirements in California for obtaining a driver's license. You cannot consent to sexual intercourse with anyone who is not your legal spouse or domestic partner. This 
 means that any other adult who has sex with an 
 emancipated minor can still be prosecuted for unlawful 
 sexual intercourse with a minor. 56 Alternatives to emancipation As an alternative to emancipation, you can consider: Family counseling to help improve your relationship 
 with your parents while living with them. Obtaining an order to make someone you trust your legal guardian until you become 18 years old. Making an informal agreement with your parents that allows you to live with someone else. Note: The law 
 allows the caregiver to enroll you in school and obtain 
 basic medical care for you by completing a Caregiver's 
 Authorization Affidavit, even if the caregiver does not 
 have a court order for child custody. The affidavit can be 
 found online at http: //www. courts. ca. gov/documents/caregiver. pdf Getting help from public or private agencies in your area. Rights of unemancipated minors A minor who is 12 years of age or older may consent to mental health treatment or counseling on 
 an outpatient basis, or to residential shelter services 
 or other supportive services on a temporary or 
 emergency basis. Both of the following 
 requirements must be satisfied: A minor who is 12 years or older may file for a domestic violence restraining order in the minor's 
 own name. (1) (2) The minor, in the opinion of the attending 
 professional person, is mature enough to 
 participate intelligently in the outpatient 
 services or residential shelter services. The minor (A) would present a danger of 
 physical or mental harm to self or to others 
 without the mental health treatment or 
 counseling or residential shelter services, or 
 (B) is the alleged victim of incest or child 
 abuse. A minor may consent to the matters provided in 
 Family Code sections 6920 to 6930, subject to 
 certain limitations, and the consent of the minor's 
 parent or legal guardian is not necessary. For 
 example: Mental health treatment, outpatient counseling, 
 emergency residential shelter service 7 Other rights A minor who is 12 years of age or older may 
 consent to medical care and counseling relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a drug- or alcohol related problem, prevention of a 
 sexually transmitted disease, or prevention or treatment of pregnancy. (2) A minor may make a contract in the same manner as an adult. However, the contract can 
 be disaffirmed if the law so permits. Minors may never (A) give a delegation of 
 power (B) contract relating to real property, or 
 (C) contract relating to personal property not 
 within the minor's immediate possession or 
 control. (3) (1) Order and Notices to Minor on Request to Marry or Establish a Domestic Partnership Case Number: ŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁŁ FL 915, Page 5 of 5 Fraud: Either party decided to marry or register the domestic partnership as a result of fraud. The party 
 was deceived about something vital to the 
 relationship that directly affected the decision to 
 marry or become a domestic partner. Some 
 examples are hiding the inability to have children or 
 just wanting to get a green card. Force: Either party was forced to consent. Physical incapacity: One of the parties was physically incapable of "consummating" the relationship (having sexual intercourse) and the 
 incapacity appears to be "incurable. "8 Annulments: void marriage or 
 domestic partnership The law describes circumstances in which a 
 marriage or domestic partnership is void (not 
 legally valid) from the very beginning. Bigamous relationship: One or both people are already married to (or in a registered domestic partnership with) someone else. For more 
 information, see Family Code section 2201. Incestuous relationship: This is a marriage or partnership between two people who are close blood relatives. See Family Code section 2200. Family Code section 2210 describes circumstances in which a marriage or domestic partnership can 
 be declared invalid (or voidable) . The following 
 must have taken place at the time the parties married 
 or registered the domestic partnership: Under age: The person filing for annulment was under 18 years old. Unsound mind: Either party was unable to understand the nature of the marriage or domestic 
 partnership, including the obligations that come 
 with it. 9 Annulments: voidable marriage 
 or domestic partnership Visit the California Courts Online Self Help 
 Center at www. courts. ca. gov/1037. htm#legal. Talk to a lawyer. For help finding a lawyer, go to www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp findlawyer. htm. How to annul a marriage or 
 domestic partnership Visit your local court's self help center at www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp selfhelpcenters. htm. 10 There are a number of forms and steps to complete 
 when filing for annulment. For information and 
 procedures for filing and responding to an annulment 
 case that is filed in family court, you can: Prior existing marriage or domestic partnership: 
 The marriage or domestic partnership took place 
 after the former spouse or domestic partner was 
 absent for five years and not known to be living, or 
 was thought to be dead. 11 How to end a marriage, domestic 
 partnership, or both Dissolution (Divorce) : A divorce judgment ends your marriage or domestic partnership, or both. You will be 
 legally a single person again. In a divorce case you can 
 ask the judge to make orders about parenting issues, 
 child support, spousal or partner support, and dividing 
 property and debts. Legal Separation: A legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership. A couple may 
 decide to file for legal separation instead of a divorce 
 for religious reasons, financial reasons, or because 
 they just want to live apart and have court orders about 
 money, property, and parenting issues. For information about divorce and legal separation, 
 including the procedures for filing in family court go 
 to www. courts. ca. gov/selfhelp divorce. htm. Read Legal Steps for a Divorce or Legal Separation (form FL 107 INFO) . This form can be found online 
 at www. courts. ca. gov/documents/fl 107 info. pdf. Note: See Family Code section 2211 for the time 
 limits for filing to nullify a voidable legal relationship. Summary Dissolution: This type of action is available 
 for couples who have been married or domestic 
 partners for less than five years, do not have children 
 together, do not seek an order for support, do not own 
 real estate or land, and have limited debts and 
 property. For more information, go to: http: //www. courts. ca. gov/1241. htm; http: //www. courts. ca. gov/1242. htm; and http: //www. courts. ca. gov/16430. htm. Order and Notices to Minor on Request to Marry or Establish a Domestic Partnership Revised January 1, 2020 Case Number: ŁŁŁ</div>
