 www. courtinfo. ca. gov
 Approved July 1, 2007 Optional Form
 Probate Code, §1511
 GC 505, Page 1 of 2 Forms You Need to Ask the Court to Appoint a Guardian of the Person
 (ProbateŠGuardianships and Conservatorships) 
 Look at the numbers at the top of a form to match them with the form numbers listed below. You can use this form as a checklist. 1 Fill out, sign, and file with the court
 either of the following form pe
 titions ("your petition") : 
 Form GC 210 (P) , Petition for Appoin
 tment of Guardian of the Person (recommended if you won't have an 
 attorney to help you) ; 
 or
 Form GC 210, Petition for Appointment of Guardian of Minor
 . 23 Fill out 
 the following forms and attach them to or 
 file them separately with your petition: 
 4 I want to become a guardian of a child. What forms do I need to file with the court? 
 What must I do if I want the court to a
 ppoint someone other than myself as guardian? 
 Instead of signing item 1 of Form GC 211, 
 listed above in Step 2, ask the 
 person you want the court to 
 appoint as guardian to sign item 1 of that form. Many courts don't require that form if the person you want as 
 guardian signs your petition (as an addi
 tional petitioner) , so check with the c
 ourt on the need to file that form
 if that person signed your petition. See page 2 of 
 this form to learn about use of another part of 
 Form GC 211. Sign and attach to your petition one copy of
 Form FL 105/GC 120, 
 Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and 
 Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) , 
 for all children you think need a guardian. 
 Fill out, sign, and file Form FW 001
 , Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs, 
 and fill out and give 
 the court clerk Form FW 003
 , Order on Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs, 
 for the judge to sign. 
 What can I do if I can't afford to pay the court's filing fees? 5 Attach to your petiti
 on a separate copy 
 of Form GC 210 (CA) , 
 Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information 
 Attachment, for each child you think needs a guardian. 
 Sign and file separately with your petition
 Form GC 212, 
 Confidential Guardian Screening Form
 . This form is confidential, under th
 e direct control of the court, and not available to the general public. 
 Instead of filling out and signing Form GC 212, 
 listed above in Step 2, ask the 
 person you want the court to 
 appoint as guardian to fill
 out and sign that form. 
 The court clerk will give you a case numb
 er, a date and time when, and a courtroo
 m or department of the court where 
 the judge will hear your request to appo
 int a guardian. Take an extra copy of
 your petition and the other papers you 
 must file to the court when you file th
 e originals and ask the clerk to stamp th
 e filing date and case number on your 
 copies and note the hearing date
 and place on your copy of the petition. So
 me courts will require you to give the clerk 
 one or more extra copies of your papers, so check with your court before you go to the 
 court to file the papers. 
 What happens when I file my petition and the other forms listed above? ORFile separately with your petition 
 any local forms your court wants you 
 to file with your petition (check 
 your court's local rules and guidelines for in
 formation and instructio
 ns about these forms) . If required by your court, sign a
 nd file separately with your petition
 , Form GC 211, 
 Consent of Proposed 
 Guardian
 (item 1 of that multi purpose form, at the top of the page) . Many courts don't require that form if you 
 are asking for your own appointmen
 t as guardian, so check with y
 our court before you file it. 
 * Appointment of a guardian
