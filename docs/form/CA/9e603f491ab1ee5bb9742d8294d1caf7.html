      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: This is an information sheet to help you fill out form ICWA 010 (A) , Indian Child Inquiry Attachment or in a probate guardianship, page 5 of form GC 210 (CA) , Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information Attachment, and form ICWA 030, Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child. 1. a. Form Approved for Optional Use Judicial Council of California 
 ICWA 005 INFO [Rev. January 1, 2020] INFORMATION SHEET ON INDIAN CHILD INQUIRY ATTACHMENTS AND NOTICE OF CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDING FOR INDIAN CHILDwww. courts. ca. gov Page 1 of 2 c. ICWA 005 INFOINFORMATION SHEET ON INDIAN CHILD INQUIRY ATTACHMENTS AND NOTICE OF CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDING FOR INDIAN CHILDForm ICWA 010 (A) , Indian Child Inquiry Attachment, or page 5 of form GC 210 (CA) , Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information Attachment You are responsible for helping to find out if the child is or may be an Indian child and filling out the information requested on ICWA 010 (A) , Indian Child Inquiry Attachment, or on page 5 of form GC 210 (CA) , Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information Attachment form. This is important because if the child is an Indian child, specific steps must be taken to prevent the breakup of the child's Indian family and to obtain for the child resources and services that are culturally specific to the child's family. The court will check to make 
 sure that the child receives these resources and services. Tips on how to fill out form ICWA 010 (A) , Indian Child Inquiry Attachment, or page 5 of form GC 210 (CA) , Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information Attachment Try to find contact information for the child™s parents or other legal guardian, the child's Indian custodian (if the child is living 
 with an Indian person other than a parent) , the child's grandparents and great grandparents, and other available family 
 members. Contact the child's parents or other legal guardian and the child's Indian custodian and other available family members and 
 ask them (and the child, if he or she is old enough) these questions: 2. Is the child a member of a tribe, and if they think he or she might be, then which tribe or tribes? b. Are they members of a tribe, and if they think they might be, which tribes? Does the child or the child™s parents live in Indian country, including a reservation, rancheria, Alaska Native village or 
 other tribal trust land? d. Does the child or any of the child™s relatives receive services or benefits from a tribe, and if yes, which tribe? Does the child or any of the child™s relatives receive services or benefits available to Indians from the federal government? e. 3. If you are in touch with any of the child™s relatives, ask them the same questions. The court clerk™s office cannot file your petition unless you have filled out and attached to the petition form ICWA 010 (A) , Indian Child Inquiry Attachment. This does not apply to a petition for appointment of a guardian in a probate guardianship or a petition filed in the 
 juvenile court under Welfare and Institutions Code sections 601 or 602. After taking the steps listed above to find out whether the child is an Indian child, if you have reason to believe that the child is an 
 Indian child, you must contact the tribe or tribes that may have a connection with the child about your court case. You have reason to 
 believe the child is an Indian child if any of the people you question answers yes to any of your questions. Tribes that learn of the case 
 can investigate and advise you and the court whether the child is a tribal member or eligible to become a tribal member, and can then 
 decide whether to get involved in the case or assume tribal jurisdiction. Contacts with the tribe or tribes should include contacting the tribe's designated agent for service of notice under the Indian Child Welfare Act published in the Federal Register by telephone, facsimile, or email and sharing with the tribe or tribes information identified 
 by the tribe as necessary to make a determination about the child's tribal membership or eligibility for membership, as well as 
 information on the current status of the child and the case. Some tips to help you figure out if you have a reason to know the child is an Indian child. You have reason to know: 1. 2. 3. If the child, an Indian tribe, an Indian organization, an attorney, a public or private agency, or a member of the child™s 
 extended family says or provides information to anyone involved in the case that the child is an Indian child; If the child, the child™s parents, or an Indian custodian live in a predominately Indian community; or If the child or the child™s family has received services or benefits from a tribe or services that are available to Indians from 
 tribes or the federal government, such as the Indian Health Service. These are just a few of the facts that would give you reason to know that a child is an Indian child. There also may be other information 
 that would give you reason to know that the child is an Indian child. Form ICWA 030, Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child Following your inquiry about the child's Indian status and contacts with the child's tribe or tribes, if necessary, you must provide formal notice on form ICWA 030, Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child, if you know or have reason to know the child is an Indian child. a. b. c. ICWA 005 INFO [Rev. January 1, 2020] INFORMATION SHEET ON INDIAN CHILD INQUIRY ATTACHMENTS AND NOTICE OF CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDING FOR INDIAN CHILDPage 2 of 21. ICWA 005 INFOWho do you need to notify? If you know or have reason to know that the child is an Indian child, you must send the Notice to the following: Child™s parents or other legal guardian, including adoptive parents; 2. 3. Child™s Indian custodian (if the child is living with an Indian person who has legal custody of the child under tribal law or custom, 
 under state law, or if the parent asked that person to take care of the child) ; Child™s tribe or tribes; and 4. Sacramento Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Federal Office Building, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, California 95825 (if 
 the parents, Indian custodian, or tribe cannot be determined or located) . Tips on how to find the address for the child's tribe or tribes The Secretary of the Interior periodically updates and publishes in the Federal Register (see 25 C. F. R. § 23. 12) , a list of tribe names 
 and addresses. The Bureau of Indian Affairs also keeps a list. You can access the Federal Register list, and other resources related to ICWA, on the Bureau of Indian Affairs website at www. bia. gov/bia/ois/dhs/. Copy to the Secretary of the Interior and the Area Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs If you know the identity and location of the parent, Indian custodian, and the tribe or tribes, when you send the Notice to the parent, Indian custodian, and the tribe or tribes, you must also send a copy to the Secretary of the Interior at 1849 C Street, N. W. , Washington, 
 D. C. 20240 and a copy to the Sacramento Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Federal Office Building, 2800 Cottage Way, 
 Sacramento, CA 95825. Copy to the Area Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs If you do not know the identity and location of the child™s parents, Indian custodian, and tribe or tribes, you must send copies of the Notice and the other documents to the Sacramento Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Federal Office Building, 2800 Cottage Way, 
 Sacramento, CA 95825. In order to help establish the child™s tribal identity, provide as much information as possible, including the 
 child™s name, birthdate, and birth place; the name of the tribe or tribes; the names of all of the child™s known relatives with addresses 
 and other identifying information; and a copy of the petition in the case. How do you send the Notice and prove to the court that you have done so? If you have an attorney, he or she will complete the steps described below. If you are representing yourself without an attorney in a probate guardianship case, the court clerk will help you with steps 1 and 2 below, including doing the mailing and signing the certificate 
 of mailing on page 9 of the Notice, but you must deliver copies of the Notice and other documents listed in step 1 below to the court in 
 addressed envelopes ready for mailing and then do step 3. Mail to the persons and organizations listed at the top of this page, by registered or certified mail, with return receipt requested, 
 copies of the following filled out and signed forms: 1. 2. 3. Your petition; Form ICWA 010 (A) , Indian Child Inquiry Attachment or, in a probate guardianship case, form GC 210 (CA) , Guardianship PetitionŠChild Information Attachment; and Form ICWA 030, Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child. The person who does the mailing must fill out the information requested on page 10 of form ICWA 030, Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child, and then date and sign the original form on page 9. Go to the court and file with the clerk of the court proof that you have given notice to everyone listed above and on page 10 of form ICWA 030, Notice of Child Custody Proceeding for Indian Child. Your proof must consist of the following: a. b. c. The original signed Notice (form ICWA 030) and copies of the documents you sent with it (the petition and form ICWA 010 (A) or form GC 210 (CA) ) ; All return receipts given to you by the post office and returned from the mailing; and All responses you receive from the child™s parents, the child™s Indian custodian, the child™s tribe or tribes, and the Bureau of 
 Indian Affairs. Please note that you are subject to court sanctions if you knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact 
 concerning whether the child is an Indian child or counsel a party to do so. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 224. 3 (e) . ) </div>
