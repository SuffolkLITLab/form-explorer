CHILD'S INFORMATION SHEET— 
REQUEST TO CHANGE COURT ORDER  
(Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 353.1, 388)

TO THE CHILD: This information sheet tells you about your right to ask the court to change a decision the  
court has made about your life and the rules that must be followed when you want to ask the court to change a  
decision. It also explains your right to ask the court to make an order about your relationship with a brother or  
sister. If you are under 12 years of age, your attorney must talk with you about this information. If you are 12  
years of age or older and in court at the dispositional hearing, the court must also talk with you about this  
information. The court must mail this information to you after a dispositional hearing. 

A.

I have just made a decision about your life. I will be making other decisions about your life. You have a right to ask me to change 
a decision I have made. You have an attorney who will help you with this. 

For me to change a decision I have made, you must talk with your attorney and have your attorney ask me to change my decision.  

Your attorney will have to fill out a form called Request to Change Court Order (form JV-180).  

The form will explain to me the changes that have happened in your life and why the changes you want me to make in the court 
order will make things better for you.  

You may get a copy of the blank form from your attorney or from the court clerk's office at the courthouse to review so you know 
what information needs to be on the form.   

1.

You must tell your attorney the following information:

What has changed since I made the decision? If nothing has changed, what new information do you want to tell me?

What changes to my decision do you want me to make?

If I make the changes you want, will you be better off than if I do not make these changes? Tell me how the changes will 
make you healthier, safer, and happier.  

2.

After you speak with your attorney, your attorney will fill out the form.

I will read the form.

I may ask the other people involved with your case if they think you have given me the kind of information I must have in 
order to change my decision. Then I will decide if you told me anything new and if the change you want me to make is 
good for you.   

If I believe you have not told me anything new or if I believe what you want me to change is not good for you, I will not 
make any changes. The court clerk will send to you and all the people involved with your case  a written notice of my 
decision not to make any changes. 

If I believe you did tell me something new and what you are asking me to change may be better for you, I will schedule a 
court date for you. The court clerk will send to you and all the people involved with your case a written notice of my 
decision to schedule a hearing and the date of the hearing. 

At that court date, everyone involved in your case will be present and allowed to speak.  

After everyone has spoken, I will make the final decision. I will make the changes you want only if I believe you have 
told me something new and what you are asking for is good for you.

If you have a brother or sister who lives with the parent you were removed from, you may ask me to make an order allowing visits 
with him or her. 
  
If you have a brother or sister who is or might become a dependent of the court, you may ask me to make an order allowing visits,
to make an order placing you in the same home, to make other orders that may be in the best interest of you and your brother or 
sister, and to consider your relationship with your brother or sister when making decisions about him or her.

If you have any questions, please ask your attorney. Your attorney will be able to answer your questions about court procedures 
and the laws I will use in making my decisions.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
