24 on form DV-100), you may be eligible to fill out a simpler form, form FL-155. Read form DV-570 to see if you 
are eligible to fill out form FL-155. Before your court date, you must file form FL-150 or FL-155 with the court. 
Then you must have a server mail a copy to the person in       and have your server complete form DV-250, Proof 
of Service by Mail. After form DV-250 is completed, file it with the court.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
