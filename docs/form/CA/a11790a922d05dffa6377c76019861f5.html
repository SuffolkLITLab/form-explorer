CAPITAL CASE ATTORNEY TRIAL CHECKLIST

CASE NUMBER:

Note: Under Penal Code section 1240.1(e)(1), in capital cases, the obligations of defendant's trial counsel, whether retained by the 
defendant or court-appointed, and the prosecutor include taking all steps necessary to facilitate the preparation and timely certification 
of the record of all trial court proceedings.  

Instructions: This checklist is designed to be a tool for counsel to use throughout the trial in death penalty cases to ensure timely 
compliance with record preparation requirements and to make the certification of the record of the trial in these cases easier and more 
efficient for both counsel and the court. To acknowledge that counsel has reviewed this checklist as early as possible in the trial 
proceedings in a case in which the death penalty may be imposed, within 10 days of their first appearance, primary counsel for each 
defendant and the prosecution must sign and submit this checklist. Counsel may, but is not required to, use the right-hand column on 
the checklist to monitor their compliance with record preparation requirements. 

ATTORNEY TASK

FOR OPTIONAL  
USE BY ATTORNEY

DURING TRIAL 

 1.  Review, sign, and submit checklist. Within 10 days of your first appearance in court, review, sign, 

and submit this checklist. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.230(b).)

 2.  Review daily transcripts and identify errors or omissions. During trial, you are required to call 

the court's attention to any errors or omissions you find in the daily reporter's transcripts. Immaterial 
typographical errors that cannot conceivably cause confusion are not required to be brought to the 
court's attention. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.230(c).) 

 3.  Ensure all exhibits are marked. Make sure that all exhibits that you offer during the trial are 

properly marked for identification. 

 4.  Comply with rule 2.1040. If you present or offer into evidence an electronic sound or sound-and-

video recording, including a recording of a deposition or other prior testimony or a video that is made 
part of a digital or electronic presentation, you must comply with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.1040. 
Among other things, this rule requires that you provide a transcript of the electronic recording, which, 
under rule 8.610, must be included in the record on appeal. 

 5.  Provide copies of audio or visual aids to the court. If you use any audio or visual aids in 
presentations to the jury that are not subject to rule 2.1040, including digital or electronic 
presentations, provide a copy of the audio or visual aid to the court. If a visual aid is oversized, 
provide a photograph of that visual aid in place of the original. For digital or electronic presentations, 
provide the presentation in its native electronic format and a printout showing the full text of all slides 
or images. Photographs and printouts must be on 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 
4.230(f).)

 8.  Review reporter's transcript, clerk's transcript, and lists. When the clerk delivers the clerk's and 

reporter's transcripts and the lists to you, you must: 

          •   Review the docket sheets, minute orders, and lists of appearances, exhibits, motions, and jury 

instructions to determine whether the reporter's transcript is complete; and 

          •   Review the court file to determine whether the clerk's transcript is complete. 
              (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.619(a)(1).)

 9.  Confer. Within 21 days after the clerk delivers the transcripts and lists, you must confer with 

opposing counsel to discuss any errors or omissions in the reporter's or clerk's transcript identified 
during your review. If the clerk's and reporter's transcripts, combined, exceed 10,000 pages, this time 
limit is extended by 3 days for each 1,000 pages of combined transcript over 10,000 pages. (Cal. 
Rules of Court, rule 8.619(a)(2).)

 10. Serve and file declaration and request for corrections or additions/statement. Within 30 days 
after the clerk delivers the transcripts and lists to you, each trial counsel must serve and file both of 
the following (if the clerk's and reporter's transcripts, combined, exceed 10,000 pages, this time limit  

       is extended by 3 days for each 1,000 pages of combined transcript over 10,000 pages):

    a. A declaration stating that counsel or another person under counsel's supervision has performed the 

tasks required by 8.613(f), including meeting and conferring with opposing counsel. (Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 8.619(b)(1)(A).)

    b. ONE of the following: 

          •   A request to include additional materials in the record or to correct errors that have come to 

counsel's attention. A request for additions to the reporter's transcript must state the nature and 
date of the proceedings and, if known, the identity of the reporter who reported them; OR 

          •   A statement that counsel does not request any corrections or additions. 

        Counsel may file a joint statement or request. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.619(b)(1).)

11. Participate in hearing to certify the record for completeness. If any party files a request for 

corrections or additions to the record, the trial court will set a hearing to consider the request. (Cal. 
Rules of Court, rule 8.619(c).)

12. Participate, as necessary, in certification of the record for accuracy.  

          •   When appellate counsel for the defendant is retained or appointed, the trial court will send that 

counsel a copy of the record that has been certified for completeness. Within 90 days after that, 
appellate counsel or any other party may serve and file a request for corrections or additions to 
the record. If the clerk's and reporter's transcripts, combined, exceed 10,000 pages, this time 
limit is extended by 15 days for each 1,000 pages of combined transcripts over 10,000 pages. 

          •   If a request for corrections or additions to the record is filed, unless otherwise ordered by the 
trial court, within 10 days after that request is filed, defendant's appellate counsel and the trial 
counsel from the prosecutor's office must meet and confer, in person or by telephone, to discuss 
the request and any application to unseal records served on the prosecutor's office.

I acknowledge that I have reviewed this checklist.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
