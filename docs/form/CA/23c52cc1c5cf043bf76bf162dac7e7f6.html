 Judicial Council of California
 , www. courts. ca. gov 
 Rev. January 1, 2021, Optional Form 
 This information sheet tells you how to fill out 
 Proof of 
 Service (Appellate Division
 ) (form APP 109
 ) or Proof of 
 Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP-
 109 E) . This information sheet is not part of the proof of 
 service and does not need to be copied, served, or filed. 
 ﬁServingﬂ a document on a person means having the 
 document delivered to that person. The general 
 requirements for serving documents are set out in 
 California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010. 6Œ
 1013 a (you can get a copy of these laws at any county 
 law library or online at 
 www. leginfo. ca. gov. calaw. html) 
 . There are three main ways to serve documents: (1) by 
 mail, (2) by personal delivery, or (3) by electronic 
 
 service. 
 When a document is served by mail, it must be put in a 
 sealed envelope or package that is addressed to the 
 
 person who is being served and that has the postage fully 
 prepaid. The envelope then has to be deposited with the 
 U. S. Postal Service by leaving it at a U. S. Postal Service 
 office or mail drop or at an office or business mail drop 
 where the person serving the document knows the mail 
 
 is picked up every day and deposited with the U. S. 
 Postal Service. 
 When a document is personally delivered to a party who 
 is represented by an attorney, the document must either 
 be given directly to the attorney representing that party 
 
 or the document can be placed in an envelope or package 
 addressed to the attorney and left with the receptionist at 
 the attorney™s office or with a person who is in charge of 
 the attorney™s office. When a document is personally 
 served on a party who is not represented by an attorney, 
 the document must either be given directly to the party 
 or the document can be given to someone who is at least 
 
 18 years old at the party™s residence between the hours 
 of eight in the morning and six in the evening. 
 You may be able to serve a document electronically if 
 the person being served has agreed to accept electronic 
 service or if the court has ordered the person to accept 
 
 electronic service. The requirements for electronic 
 service are set out in California Code of Civil Procedure 
 section 1010. 6. 
 When a document is electronically served, it must be 
 served either by electronic transmission or by electronic 
 
 notification. ﬁElectronic transmissionﬂ means sending 
 
 the document to the person™s electronic service 
 
 address, an email address the person has given the 
 
 court and the other parties to the case for this purpose. 
 
 ﬁElectronic notificationﬂ means sending a notice to the 
 
 person with the exact name of the document and a 
 
 hyperlinkŠa link to a web addressŠat which the 
 
 document may be viewed and downloaded. 
 Rule 8. 817 of the California Rules of Court requires that 
 before you file any document with the court in a case in 
 the appellate division of the superior court, you must 
 serve one copy of the document on each of the other 
 parties in the case and on anyone else when required by 
 law (statute or rule of court) . Other rules require that 
 certain documents in cases in the appellate division be 
 served, including the notice of appeal and the notice 
 designating the record on appeal in appeals in limited 
 civil cases and briefs in all appeals. (For more 
 information about appeals in general and about these 
 
 documents, read 
 Information on Appeal Procedures for 
 Limited Civil Cases 
 (form APP 101 INFO) , 
 Information 
 on Appeal Procedures for Misdemeanors 
 (form CR 131-
 INFO) , and 
 Information on Appeal Procedures for 
 Infractions 
 (form CR 141 INFO) . ) 
 State law (the Code of Civil Procedure) says that a 
 document in a court case can only be served by a person 
 
 who is over 18 years old. Service by mail or by personal 
 delivery must be by someone who is not a party in the 
 case; electronic service may be performed directly by a 
 party. 
 If you are a party in a case and wish to serve documents 
 by mail or by personal delivery, 
 you must have 
 someone else who is over 18 and who is not a party in 
 
 your case serve any documents in your case for you. 
 You will need to give the person who is serving the 
 document for you (the server) the names and addresses 
 of all the people who need to be served with that 
 document. You will also need to give the server one 
 
 copy of each document that needs to be served for each 
 person who is being served.

 If you are serving documents electronically, you can do 
 so yourself or have another person over 18 do it for you. 
 
 The person doing the serving (the server) will need the 
 names and electronic service addresses of everyone who 
 must be served, as well as the document to be served in a 
 form that allows it to be electronically transmitted or 
 made available by hyperlink. 
 
 A ﬁproof of serviceﬂ shows the court that a document 
 was served as required by the law. Rule 8. 817 also 
 requires a party who is filing a document with the court 
 in a case in the appellate division to attach a proof of 
 
 service to the document the party wants to file. You can 
 use Proof of Service (Appellate Division
 ) (form APP-
 109) or
 Proof of Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109 E) to give the court this proof of service 
 in any case in the appellate division of the superior 
 
 court. The server should follow the instructions below 
 for completing the 
 Proof of Service (Appellate Division
 ) (form APP 109) or
 Proof of Electronic Service 
 (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109 E) . If another person 
 is serving the documents for youŒas is required if the 
 
 document will be served by mail or personal deliveryŒ
 tell the server to give you the original form when it is 
 filled out and signed. You will need to attach the original 
 proof of service to the document you want to file. 
 If you are electronically filing the document, the proof of 
 service may also be filed electronically. However, the 
 original signed proof of service must be kept by the 
 party filing the document and produced upon request. 
 If you are the server (the person who serves a document 
 for a party in a court case) , you must prepare and sign 
 the proof of service. If you served the document by mail 
 
 or personal delivery, you can use 
 Proof of Service 
 (Appellate Division
 ) (form APP 109) to prepare this 
 proof of service in any case in the appellate division. If 
 you served the document electronically, you can use 
 Proof of Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form 
 APP 109 E) to prepare the proof of service. 
 
 These instructions are for 
 Proof of Service (Appellate 
 Division) 
 (form APP 109) , if you are serving the 
 document by mail or personal delivery. If you are 
 serving the document electronically, please see , 
 below, for instructions on how to fill out 
 Proof of 
 Electronic Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP-
 109 E) . 
 You can fill out most of the information on 
 Proof of 
 Service (Appellate Division) 
 (form APP 109) by copying 
 the information from the document you are serving 
 before you serve that document. However, you should 
 
 not sign and date the form until after you have finished 
 serving the document.

 are swearing, under penalty of perjury, that the 
 information that you put in the form is true and 
 correct.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields and Utilization:<sup>*</sup></h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
