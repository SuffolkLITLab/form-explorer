 This information sheet tells you about appeals in limited 
 civil cases. These are civil cases in which the amount of 
 money claimed is $25, 000 or less. 
 If you are the party who is appealing (asking for the trial 
 court™s decision to be reviewed) , y
 ou are called the 
 APPELLANT, and you should read Information for the 
 Appellant
 , starting on page 2
 . If you received notice that 
 another party in your case is appealing, you are called 
 the RESPONDENT and you should read Information for 
 the Respondent, start
 ing on page 
 11. This information sheet does not cover everything you 
 may need to know about appeals in limited civil cases. It 
 is meant only to give you a general idea of the appeal 
 process. To learn more, you should read rules 8. 800
 Œ8. 843 and 8. 880
 Œ8. 891 of the California Rules of Court, 
 which set out the procedures for limited civil appeals. 
 You can get these rules at any courthouse or county law 
 library or online at 
 www. cour

 . An appeal is a request to a higher court to review a 
 deci
 sion made by a judge or jury in a lower court. 
 In a 
 limited civil case, the court hearing the appeal
 is the 
 appellate division of the superior court and the lower 
 court
 Šcalled the ﬁ
 trial court
 ﬂ in this information 
 sheet
 Šis the superior court. 
 It is impor
 tant to understand that 
 an appeal is 
 NOT
 a new trial
 . The appellate division will not consider new 
 evidence, such as the testimony of new witnesses or new 
 
 exhibits. The appellate division™s job is to review a 
 record of what happened in the trial court and 
 the trial 
 court™s decision to see if certain kinds of legal errors 
 were made:

 . Prejudicial error: 
 The appellant (the party who is 
 appealing) may ask the appellate division to 
 
 determine if an error was made about either the law 
 or court procedures in the case that caused 
 substantial harm to the appellant (this is called 
 ﬁpreju
 dicial errorﬂ) . 
 Prejudicial error can include things like errors made 
 by the judge about the law, errors or misconduct by
 the lawyers, incorrect instructions given to the jury, 
 and misconduct by the jury that harmed the 
 appellant. 
 When it conducts its rev
 iew, the appellate 
 division presumes that the judgment, order, or other 
 decision being appealed is correct. 
 It is the 
 responsibility of the appellant to show the appellate 
 
 division that an error was made and that the error 
 was harmful. 
 No substantial evide
 nce: 
 The appellant may also ask 
 the appellate division to determine if there was 
 
 substantial evidence supporting the judgment, order, 
 or other decision
 being appealed
 . When it conducts 
 its review, the appellate division only looks to see if 
 there was evide
 nce that 
 reasonably 
 supports the 
 decision. The appellate division generally will not 
 reconsider the jury™s or trial court™s conclusion about 
 which side had more or stronger evidence or whether 
 witnesses were telling the truth or lying. 
 The appellate divisi
 on generally will not overturn the 
 judgment, order, or other decision 
 being appealed 
 unless the record clearly shows that one of these legal 
 errors
 was made

 January
 1, 2021 You do not 
 have 
 to have a lawyer; if you are an 
 individual (
 rather than
 a corporation, for 
 example) , you 
 are allowed to represent yourself in an appeal in a 
 limited civil case. But appeals can be complicated and 
 you will have to follow the same rules that lawyers have 
 to follow. If you have any questions about the appeal 
 procedures, you should t
 alk to a lawyer. 
 
 If you decide not to use a lawyer, you must 
 put
 your 
 address, telephone number, 
 fax number
 (if available) 
 , and e
 -mail address (if available) on the first page of 
 every document you file with the court and let the court 
 know 
 if this
 conta
 ct information changes so that the 
 court can contact you if needed. 
 You have to hire your own attorney if you want one. 
 You can get information about finding an attorney on the

 in 
 the 
 Getting

 section
 . This 
 part of the information sheet
 is written for the 
 appellant
 Šthe party 
 who is 
 appealing the trial court™s 
 decision. It explains some of the rules and procedures 
 relating to appealing a decision in a l
 imited civil case. 
 The information may also be helpful to the respondent. 
 Additional information for respondents can be found 
 starting on page 
 11 of this 
 information sheet
 . Only a party in the trial court case can appeal a decision 
 in that case. You 
 may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a 
 spouse, a child, or another relative unless you are a 
 
 legally appointed 
 representative
 of that person
 (such 
 as 
 the person™s guardian or cons
 ervator) 
 . 
 No. Generally, you can only appeal the final judgment
 Šthe
 decision at the end that decides the whole case. Other 
 rulings made by the trial court before 
 the 
 final judgment 
 generall
 y cannot be separately appealed
 but can be 
 reviewed only later as part of an appeal of the final 
 judgment. There are a few exceptions 
 to this general 
 rule. Code of Civil Procedure section 904. 2 lists a few 
 types of orders in a limited civil case that can be 
 appealed right away. 
 These include orders that: 
 Change or refuse to change the place of trial (venue) 
 Grant a motion to quash servic
 e of summons or 
 grant a motion to stay or dismiss the action on the 
 
 ground of inconvenient forum 
 Grant a new trial or deny a motion for judgment 
 
 notwithstanding the verdict
 Discharge or refuse to discharge an attachment or 
 grant a right to attach 
 Grant o
 r dissolve an injunction or refuse to grant or 
 dissolve an injunction
 Appoint a receiver
 Are made after final judgment in the case
 (You can get a copy of Code of Civil Procedure section 
 904. 2 at

 . ) First
 , you must serve and file a notice of appeal. The 
 notice of appeal tells the other party or parties in the case 
 
 and the trial court that you are appealing the trial court™s 
 decision. You may use

 You should make a copy of 
 the 
 notice of appeal you

 circumstances listed in rule 8. 823, y
 ou must file your

 Yes. Unless the court waives this fee, you must pay 
 a fee 
 for 
 filing your notice of appeal. You can ask the clerk of 
 the court where you are filing the notice of appeal what 
 the fee is 
 or look 
 up the fee for an appeal in

 (note that the 
 ﬁAppeal and Writ Related Feesﬂ section
 is 
 near the end 
 of this schedule and 
 that there are different fees for 
 limited civil cases depending on the amount demanded 
 in the case
 ) . 
 If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you can 
 ask the cou

 to waive it. To do this, you must fill out 
 and file a

 You 
 can file th

 our notice

 review this 
 application
 to determine if you are eligible 
 for a fee waiver. 
 Filing a notice of appeal does NOT automatically 
 postpone most judgments or orders, such as those 
 requiring 
 you
 to pay another party money or to deliver 
 property to another party (see Code of Civil Procedure 
 sections 917. 1
 Œ917. 9 and 1176; you can get a copy of

 ) . These kinds of judgments or orders wi
 ll 
 be postponed, or ﬁstayed, ﬂ only if you request a stay and 
 the court grants your request. In most cases, other than 
 unlawful detainer cases in which the trial court™s 
 judgment gives a party possession of the property, if the 
 trial court denies your reque

 for a stay, you can apply 
 to the appellate division for a stay. If you do not get a 
 
 stay and you do not do what the trial court ordered you 
 to do, court proceedings to collect the money or 
 otherwise enforce the judgment or order may be started 
 
 against y

 The 
 first
 part of the official record of the trial court 
 proceedings is a record of what was said in the trial court 
 (this is called a record of the ﬁoral proceedingsﬂ) . Y
 ou do not have to send the appellate division a record of the 
 oral proceedings. But if you want to raise any issue in 
 your appeal that would require the appellate division to 
 consider what was said in the trial court, the appellate 
 division will need a record o
 f th
 ose 
 oral proceedings
 . For 
 example, if you are claiming that there was no
 t evidence 
 supporting the judgment, order, or other decision you are 
 appealing, the appellate division will need a record of 
 the oral proceedings
 . 
 You are responsible for deciding
 how the
 record of the 
 oral proceedings will be provided and, depending on 
 
 what option you select and your circumstances, you may 
 also be responsible for paying for preparing this record 
 or for preparing an initial draft of the record. If you do 
 not take c
 are 
 of t
 hese responsibilities, a record of the oral 
 proceedings in the trial court will not be prepared and 
 
 sent to the appellate division. 
 If the appellate division 
 does not receive this record, it will not be able to 
 review any issues that are based on w
 hat 
 was 
 said in 
 the trial court
 and it may dismiss your appeal

 (1) Reporter™s transcript
 Description: 
 A reporter™s transcript is a written 
 record (sometimes called a ﬁverbatimﬂ record) of 
 the oral proceedings in th
 e tr
 ial 
 court prepared by 
 a court reporter. 
 Rule 8. 834 
 of the California Rules 
 of Court 
 establishes the requirements relating to 
 
 reporter™s transcripts. 
 When available: 
 If a court reporter was there in 
 the trial court and made a record of the oral 
 
 proceed
 ings
 , yo
 u can choose (ﬁelectﬂ) to have the 
 court reporter prepare a reporter™s transcript for 
 
 the appellate division. In most limited civil cases, 
 however, a court reporter will not have been there 
 unless you or another party in your case made 
 specific arr
 ange
 ment
 s to have a court reporter 
 there. 
 Check with the court to see if a court 
 reporter made a record of the oral proceedings in 
 your case before 
 choosing
 this option. 
 Contents: 
 If you elect to use a reporter™s 
 transcript, you must identify by date (thi
 s is
 cal
 led 
 ﬁdesignatingﬂ) what proceedings you want 
 included in the reporter™s transcript. You can use 
 the same form you used to tell the court you 
 wanted to use a reporter™s transcript
 ŠAppellant™s
 Notice Designating Record on Appeal (Limited 
 Civil Case) 
 (for
 m AP
 P 103) 
 Što do this. 
 If you elect to use a reporter™s transcript, the 
 respondent also has the right to designate 
 additional proceedings to be included in the 
 reporter™s transcript. If you elect to proceed 
 without a reporter‚s transcript, however, the
 res
 pond
 ent may not designate a reporter™s 
 transcript without first getting an order from the 
 appellate division. 
 Cost: 
 The appellant is responsible for paying for 
 preparing a reporter™s transcript. The trial court 
 
 clerk or the court reporter will notify 
 you of t
 he 
 cost of preparing an original and one copy of the 
 reporter™s transcript. You must deposit payment 
 for this cost 
 (and a fee for the trial court) or one of 
 the substitutes allowed by rule 8. 834 
 with the trial 
 court clerk within 10 days after this 
 noti
 ce i
 s sent. 
 (See rule 8. 834 for more information about this 
 deposit and the permissible substitutes, such as a 
 waiver of this deposit signed by the court 
 reporter. ) 
 
 Unlike the fee for filing the notice of appeal and 
 the costs for preparing a clerk™s t
 rans
 crip
 t, the 
 court cannot waive the fee for preparing a 
 
 reporter™s transcript. 
 A special fund, called the 
 Transcript Reimbursement Fund, may be able to 
 help pay for the transcript. 
 You can get 
 information about this fund at 
 www. courtreportersboard. ca. gov/consumers/index
 . shtml#rtf
 . If you are unable to pay the cost of a 
 reporter™s transcript, a record of the oral
 proceedings can be prepared in other ways, by 
 
 using an agreed sta
 teme
 nt o
 r a statement on 
 appeal, which 
 are
 described below. 
 Completion and delivery: 
 After 
 the cost of 
 preparing the reporter™s transcript 
 or a permissible 
 
 substitute 
 has 
 been deposited, the court reporter 
 will prepare the transcript and submit it to the
 tri
 al 
 court clerk. 
 When the record is complete, t
 he trial 
 court clerk will submit the original transcript to the 
 
 appellate division and send you a copy of the 
 transcript. If the respondent has purchased it, a 
 copy of the reporter™s transcript will also be
 mai
 led 
 to the respondent.

 than a transcript, and you have attached your 
 agreement with the other parties to do this

 When available: 
 If you and the
 respondent have

 record of the oral proceedings (see a (3) above) 
 and agree to this, you can use an agreed 
 statement instead of a clerk™s transcript. To do

 exhibits to the appellate divi
 sion at the tim
 e briefs 
 are filed (see rule
 8. 843 for more information 
 about this procedure and see below for 
 information about briefs) . 
 Sometimes, the trial court returns an exhibit to a 
 party at the end of the trial. If the trial court 
 returned an exhib
 it to you or an
 other party and you 
 or the o
 the
 r par
 ty ask for that exhibit to be

 As soon as 
 the record on appeal is comp

 e clerk of 
 the trial court will send it to the appellate division. When 
 the appellate division receives the record, it will send 
 you a notice telling you when you must file your brief in

 Desc
 ription: 
 A ﬁbriefﬂ is a part

 ten description of 
 the facts in the case, the law that applies, and the party™s 
 argument about the issues being appealed. If you are 
 represented by a lawyer in your appeal, your lawyer will 
 prepare your br

 not represented by a 
 lawyer
 , you wi
 ll have to prepare your brief yourself. 
 You should read rules 8. 882
 Œ8. 884 of the California 
 Rules of Court, which set out the requirements for 
 preparing, serving, and filing briefs in limited civil 
 appeals
 , including req
 uirements for the format and
 length 
 of these briefs. You can 
 get copies of these
 rules 
 at any courthouse or county law library or online at

 Your brief must refer to the exact places in the clerk™s 
 transcript and the reporter™s transcript (or the 
 other
 forms 
 of the record you are using) that support 
 your argument. 
 
 Remember that an appeal is n
 ot 
 a new
 trial. The 
 appellate division will not consider new evidence, such 
 as the testimony of new witnesses or new 
 exhibits
 , so do 
 not include any new evidence in your brief. 
 Serving and filing: 
 You must serve 
 and file your br
 ief in 
 the appellate divisio
 n by the
 deadline the court set in the 
 notice it sent you, which is

 . You and the other parties 
 can
 agre
 e (stipulate) to extend 
 the time for filing this brief by up to 30 days (see rule 
 8. 882 (b) for req
 uirements for these agreements) . You 
 can also ask the court to extend the time for filing this 
 
 brief if you
 can show good 
 cause for an extension (see 
 rul
 e 8. 8

 consider in deciding whether there is good cause fo
 r an 
 extension) . You can use 
 Application for Extension of 
 Time to File Brief (Limited Civil Case) 
 (form APP
 -106) 
 to ask th
 e court for an extension. 
 If you do 
 not file your brief by the deadline set by the 
 appellate division, the court may dismiss your appe
 al. 
 Within 30 days after you serve and file your brief, the 
 respondent may, but is not required to
 , respond by 
 servin
 g and filing a respondent™s 
 brief. I
 f the respondent 
 does not file a brief, the appellant does not automatically 
 win the appeal. The c
 ourt will decide the appeal on the 
 record, the appellant™s brief, and any oral argument by 
 the appellant. 
 If the responde
 nt files a brief
 , within 20 
 days aft
 er the 
 respondent™s brief was filed, you may, but are not 
 required to, file another brief replying
 to the 
 respondent™s brief. This is called a ﬁreply brief. 
 ﬂ Once all the briefs have been filed or t
 he time to file
 them has passed, the appell
 ate
 divis
 ion will notify you of 
 the date for oral argument in your case. 
 ﬁOral argumentﬂ is the parti
 es™ chance to explain their 
 arguments to the appellate division judges in person. 
 You do not have to partic
 ipate in oral a
 rgument if you do 
 not want t
 o; 
 you ca
 n notify the appellate division that 
 you want to ﬁwaiveﬂ oral argument. 
 If all parties waive 
 
 oral
 argument, the judges will decide your appeal based 
 on the briefs and the record that were submitted. 
 But i
 f one party wai
 ves oral argument and anothe
 r party o
 r parties does not, the appellate division will hold oral 
 argument with the party or parties who 
 did not waive it. 
 If you do choose to participate in oral argument, you will 
 have up to 10 minutes for you
 r argument unle
 ss the 
 appellate division or
 der
 s othe
 rwise. Remember that the 
 judges will have already read the briefs, so you do not 
 need to read you
 r brief to the judges. It is more helpful 
 to tell the judges what you think is most important in 
 your appea
 l or ask the ju
 dges if they have any questi
 ons
 you could answer. 
 After oral argument is held (or the date it was scheduled 
 passes if all the pa
 rties waive oral argument) , the judges 
 of the appellate division will make a decision about your 
 appeal. Th
 e appellate div
 ision has 90 days after 
 the 
 dat
 e sche
 duled for 
 oral argument to decide the appeal. The 
 clerk of the court will mail you a notice of th
 e appellate 
 division™s decision. 
 
 If you decide you do not want to continue with your

 t file a writte

 is called ﬁabandoningﬂ) your appeal. You can use

 Šthe party responding to an appeal filed by 
 another party. It explains some of the rul

 procedur
 es relating to responding to
 an appe

 limited civil case. The information may also be helpful 
 
 to the appellant. 
 
 You do no
 t have 
 to do anything. The notice of appeal 
 simply tells you that another party is appealing the trial 
 cour
 t™s decision. H
 owever, this would be a good
 time to
 get advice from a lawyer, if you want it. You do not 
 have 
 to have a lawyer; if you are an individ
 ual (not a 
 corporation, for example) , you are allowed to represent 
 
 yourself in an appeal in a limited civil
 case. But appe
 als 
 can be complicated and y
 ou 
 will 
 have to follow 
 the 
 same 
 rules that lawyers have to follow. 
 
 If you have any questions about the a
 ppeal procedures, 
 you should talk to a lawyer. You must hire your own 
 lawyer if you want one. You can get i

 Even if 
 another party has already appealed, you 
 may still appeal the same judgment or order. This is 
 called a ﬁcros

 and file
 a notice of appeal. You can use 
 Notice of

 Please

 You do not

 the record on a

 the appellate division. 
 A brief is a pa

 law that applies, and the party™s argument about 
 the issues being appealed. If you are repres
 ented by a

 Once all the
 briefs 
 have been filed or the time to file 
 them has passed, the court will notify you of the date for
 oral argument in your case. 
 ﬁOral argumentﬂ is the parties™ chance to explain their 
 arguments to appellate

 not have to

 ate in oral argument if you do not 
 want to; you can notify the appellate division that you

 If all parties waive oral

 But if o

 If you do choose to participate in o

 After oral argument is held (or t
