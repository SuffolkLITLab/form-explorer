      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: WV 100 INFOHow Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Workplace Violence? What is a workplace violence protective order? Who can an employer protect under this law? 
 Under California law (Code Civ. Proc. , § 527. 8) , courts 
 can make orders to protect an employee from suffering 
 unlawful violence or credible
 threats of violence at the 
 workplace. 
 The court can order a person not to: 
 Harass or threaten the employee; 
 Contact or go near the employee; and
 Have a gun. 
 ŁŁWho can get a workplace violence protective order? 
 ww. courts. ca. gov
 
 
 WV 100 INFO, 
 Employers can obtain court orders prohibiting 
 unlawful violence or cred
 ible threats of violence 
 against their employees. To get an order under this law, 
 the petitioner 
 must be an employer. An employer is 
 defined as: 
 Every person engaged in any business or enterprise 
 
 in this state that has one 
 or more persons in service 
 under any appointment, contract of hire, or 
 apprenticeship, express or im
 plied, oral or written, irrespective of whether such person is the owner of 
 the business or is operating on a concessionaire or 
 other basis. (Lab. Code, § 350 (a) . ) 
 A federal, state, or local public agency; a city, 
 county, district, or public corporation. (Code Civ. 
 Proc. , § 527. 8 (b) (3) . ) 
 Before completing the forms 
 needed to obtain court orders under this statute, make certain you meet the 
 definition of ﬁemployerﬂ as defined above. 
 ŁŁUnder this statute, an employer
 can obtain a court order that 
 lasts up to three years on behalf of an employee. The order 
 can also protect certain family or household members of the 
 employee and other employees 
 at the employee™s workplace 
 or at other workplaces of the employer. 
 California law defines ﬁemployeesﬂ as: 
 Every person, including aliens and minors, rendering 
 actual service in any business for an employer, whether 
 gratuitously or for wages or pay; whether the wages or 
 
 pay are measured by the stan
 dard of time, piece, task, 
 commission, or other method of calculation; and 
 
 whether the service is rendered on a commission, 
 
 concessionaire, or other basis. (Lab. Code, § 350 (b) . ) 
 Members of boards of directors and public officers. 
 Volunteers or independent contractors who perform services for the employer at the employer™s work site. 
 An employer may seek protection under this law if: 
 An employee has suffered unlawful violence or a
 
 credible threat of violence from any individual; The unlawful violence was carried out in the workplace, 
 or the threat of violence can reasonably be construed to 
 be carried out in the workplace; 
 The respondent™s conduct is not allowable as part of a 
 legitimate labor dispute as permitted by Code of Civil 
 Procedure section 527. 3; and
 The respondent is not engaged in constitutionally 
 protected activity. ŁŁŁWhat forms must be used to get the order? Petition for Orders Workpl
 ace Violence Restraining 
 Orders (Petition) (
 Form WV 100) . This form tells the judge the facts of the petitioner™s case and what orders 
 the petitioner and employee 
 want the court to make. 
 3. 1. Notice of Court Hearing (Form WV 109) . This form tells 
 the parties when the hearing on
 the petition will be held. 
 These orders will be enforced by law enforcement 
 agencies. 
 Ł1. 2. 3. 4. The statute differs from other California laws that allow 
 victims of unlawful violen
 ce or credible threats of 
 violence to ask the court for these orders 
 themselves. 
 If 
 anyone other than the employ
 er wishes to apply to the court for an order prohibiting harassment, see 
 Can a Civil Harassment Restraining Order Help Me (Form 
 CH 100 INFO) ? 
 . The ﬁrespondentﬂ is the person
 against whom the employer 
 is requesting the protective order.

 This form will provide law enforcement agencies with 
 the information needed to enforce any orders that are 
 granted.

 know what to do to protect your rights, you should see a lawyer. 
 5. Workplace Violence

 WV 100 INFO, 
 How Do I Get an Order to 
 Prohibit Workplace Violence? (Workplace Violence Prevention) 
 Where can I get these forms? The employer may be represented by a lawyer, but one 
 
 is not required by law unless the employer is a 
 
 corporation. Because the employer™s lawyer will 
 generally be representing the interests of the employee, 
 the employee usually does not need his or her own 
 
 lawyer. Whether or not the 
 employer has a lawyer, the 
 respondent may have one. 
 Do I need a lawyer? What steps are needed to get the court orders? 1. 
 Fill in the 
 Petition (Form WV 100) completely and 
 fill in items 1Œ3 of the 
 Notice of Court Hearing
 (Form WV 109) . If you are seeking a 
 TRO, also fill 
 out Form WV 110. 4. If you are applying for a 
 TRO, fill out Form WV 110 
 completely. The petition and the declarations must give 
 the details of the recent acts
 of violence or credible 
 
 threats of violence and the problems they have caused 
 your employee. 
 To obtain a 
 TRO, you must notify the respondent of the 
 request for the temporary order unless both of the 
 following requiremen
 ts are satisfied: 
 a. 
 It appears from facts shown 
 on the petition that great 
 or irreparable injury will re
 sult before the matter can 
 be heard on notice; and
 You or your attorney certifies one of the following 
 to the court under oath: 
 (1) That within a reasonable time before presenting 
 the petition to the court to ask for a TRO, you 
 
 informed the respondent or the respondent™s 
 attorney when and wher
 e the request for a TRO would be made; 
 WV 100 INFOHow Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Workplace Violence? b. These forms are all 
 mandatoryŠ
 that is, they must 
 be used in the workplace violence prevention 
 proceeding. 
 Temporary Rest
 raining Order (TRO) (Form WV 110) . A TRO can be issued to provide 
 protection to the employee until the hearing is held. 
 
 It can be issued by the ju
 dge either with or without 
 notice to the respondent. 4. 2. 
 If you are seeking orders 
 based on information from 
 your employee and others and not based on what you 
 have personally observed, you 
 must have each of 
 those persons complete a declaration to attach to the 
 Petition (Form WV 100) . You may use Form 
 MC 031, 
 Attached Declaration. 3. Fill in 
 Confidential CLETS Information (Form 
 CLETS 001) with as much information as you know. If 
 the judge grants the order, th
 e information on this form 
 will be entered into a statewide protective order database that will be available to law enforcement agencies if the 
 order needs to be enforced. 
 (3) That for reasons specifie
 d, you should not be 
 
 required to inform th
 e respondent or the 
 respondent™s attorney. 
 (2) That you in good faith attempted but were 
 
 unable to inform the respondent and the 
 
 respondent™s attorney, specifying the efforts 
 made to contact them; or
 5. Take your original comp
 leted forms and copies to the 
 clerk™s office at the court. You will need at least three 
 copies: one for you, one fo
 r the employee, and one to 
 serve on the respondent. If there are other persons to 
 be protected by the order, you will need additional 
 copies of the 
 TRO. A protected person will need a 
 copy of the 
 TRO if it is necessary to call the police. 
 The clerk will file the or
 iginals, assign a case number, and return the copies ﬁfile st
 ampedﬂ to you. The clerk 
 will write your hearing date on the 
 Notice of Court Hearing
 (Form WV 109) . You can get the forms from legal publishers or on the 
 
 Internet at 
 www. courts. ca. gov. You also may be able to 
 find them at your local courthouse or county law 
 library.

 How Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Workplace Violence? (Workplace Violence Prevention) 
 WV 100 INFOHow Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Workplace Violence? 6. If you are seeking a 
 TRO (Form WV 110) , the clerk 
 will tell you where and how to present your proposed 
 order to a judge for consideration and signature. The 
 court will decide within 24 hours whether or not to 
 
 make the order. Sometimes the court decides right 
 
 away. Ask the clerk if you should wait or come back 
 later. If your request for a 
 TRO is granted while you 
 are still at the court, take 
 the signed original back to 
 the clerk to be filed. 
 8. 9. Have the respondent personally 
 served 
 with copies of the 
 Petition (Form WV 100) , the 
 Notice of Court Hearing 
 (Form WV 109) , the 
 TRO (Form WV 110) 
 (if issued) , a blank 
 Response (Form WV 120) , and a 
 blank 
 Proof of Service of Response by Mail
 (Form WV 250) . You cannot serve the respondent 
 yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process 
 server, the sheriff™s depart
 ment, or any person 18 
 years of age or older, othe
 r than you, the employee, 
 or anyone to be protected by the order. For help with 
 
 service, ask the court cler
 k for Form WV 200 INFO, What Is ﬁProof of Personal Serviceﬂ? . 
 7. If a TRO has been issued, ask the clerk whether you 
 or your lawyer will need to
 deliver a file stamped 
 copy of the TRO to each law enforcement agency 
 (police, marshal, or sheriff™s office) that might be 
 
 called on to enforce the order. If so, do so 
 
 immediately. If the court issues a TRO, it will last 
 until the hearing date. 
 Service is essential. It tells the respondent about 
 the order and the hearing. Without it, there 
 cannot be a court hearing, and your temporary 
 orders will no longer be good unless they are 
 
 extended by the court. The respondent should 
 be personally served immediately after the 
 orders are signed by the judge, unless the court 
 
 specifies a different time for service. 
 10. 
 After the respondent has been personally 
 served, 
 
 the person who served 
 the respondent must complete and sign the original 
 Proof of Personal Service (Form WV 200) . Take the signed original and copies back to the court clerk. The clerk will 
 file the original and return
 ﬁfile stampedﬂ copies to 
 you. Ask the clerk whether you should take a 
 file stamped copy to each
 law enforcement agency 
 that might be called on to enforce the order. If so, 
 
 do so immediately. 
 If the employee does not speak English, when you 
 file your papers, ask the cl
 erk if a court interpreter 
 will be available for the hearing. You may have to 
 pay a fee for the interpreter. If an interpreter will not 
 be provided, you should ask someone who is not 
 
 listed as a person to be protected on your Petition 
 
 and who is over age 18 to interpret

 WV 100 INFOHow Do I Get an Order to Prohibit Workplace Violence? 12. 
 If the judge signs the Order (Form WV 130) , ask
 the clerk to provide you with a file stamped copy 
 for each person to be protected. Ask the clerk 
 whether you or your attorney will need to deliver a 
 file stamped copy of the 
 Order to each law 
 enforcement agency that 
 might be called on to 
 enforce the order. If so, do so immediately. 
 If the respondent attended the hearing and heard the 
 terms of the 
 Order from the court, no additional 
 proof of service is necessary. If the respondent did 
 not attend the hearing, but the 
 Order issued is the same as the TRO (except fo
 r the termination date) , 
 the Order may be served on the respondent by mail. 
 File Form WV 260, 
 Proof of Service of Order After 
 Hearing by Mail
 . If the respondent did not attend 
 the hearing and the 
 Order differs from the TRO, 
 arrange to have him or her personally 
 served 
 with a copy of the 
 Order. File the completed 
 Proof of Personal Service (Form WV 200) with the court. Give a file stamped copy of the 
 Order and proof of 
 service to your employee and to each other protected 
 person. Keep at least one copy for yourself. 
 11. 
 Go to court on the date shown at item 4 on the 
 Notice of Court Hearing
 (Form WV 109) . You do 
 not need to bring any witnesses, but it helps to have 
 
 more proof of the violence 
 or threats than just one 
 person™s word. Photos
 Medical or police reports
 Damaged property
 Threatening letters, 
 e mails, or telephone 
 messagesŁŁŁŁWritten statements from witnesses made under 
 oath 
 ŁThe court may or may not 
 let witnesses speak at the 
 hearing. So, if possible, you should bring their 
 written statements under oa
 th to the hearing. (You can use Form MC 030, 
 Declaration
 . ) The respondent has the right to attend the hearing, 
 but he or she does not have 
 the right to speak to the employee or to any other person seeking protection. 
 If anyone is afraid, tell the court officer. 
 13. 
 14. 
 Request for Accommodations Assistive listening systems, computer- assisted real time captioning, or sign 
 language interpreter services are available 
 if you ask at least five court days before 
 
 the hearing. Contact the clerk™s office or 
 go to 
 www. courts. ca. gov/forms for Request for Accommoda
 tions by Persons 
 with Disabilities and Response 
 (Form MC 410) 
 . (Civ. Code, § 54. 8. ) 
 For help in your area, contact: 
 [Local information may be inserted. ] 
 You can bring to the hearing: 
 If the respondent does not obey the order, call the 
 police. The respondent can be arrested and charged 
 with a crime. 15.
