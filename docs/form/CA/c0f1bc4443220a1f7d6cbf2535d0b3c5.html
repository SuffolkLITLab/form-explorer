      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Judicial Council of California, Rev. January 1, 2021, Mandatory Form 
 Welfare and Institutions Code, §§ 781 (b) , 786, 786. 5; 
 Evid. Code, § 788 
 Cal. Rules of Court, rules 5. 830, 5. 840, 5. 850 How to Ask the Court to Seal Your Records JV 595 INFO, Page 1 of 3 JV 595 INFOHow to Ask the Court to Seal Your RecordsŁ Get a driver™s license. Ł Get a loan. Ł Rent an apartment. Ł Go to college. If you were arrested or subject to a court proceeding or had 
 contact with the juvenile justice system when you were under 18, there may be records kept by courts, police, schools, or other public agencies about what you did. If the court makes those records private (sealed) , it could be easier for you to: Ł Find a job. If the court sealed your records when probation was terminated, you do not need to 
 ask for them to be sealed. There are now three ways that records may be sealed in California. As of January 1, 2015, courts are required to 
 seal records in certain cases when the court finds that 
 probation (formal, or informal) is satisfactorily completed 
 or if your case was otherwise dismissed after the petition 
 was filed. If the court sealed all of your records at the end 
 of your case, you should have received a copy of the 
 sealing order, and you do not need to ask the court to seal 
 the records in that sealing order. For more information about when the court seals your records at the completion of probation, see form JV 596 INFO. If probation sealed your diversion records for satisfactory completion, you may wish to ask the court to seal any remaining records of your behavior. As of January 1, 2018, if you participate in a diversion program or other supervision program instead of going to 
 court, and the probation department determines that you 
 satisfactorily completed that program, the probation 
 department will seal your probation department records 
 and the records for any program you were required to 
 complete. If the probation department determines that you 
 did not satisfactorily complete the program, it will not seal 
 those records, but will give you a form to tell you why and 
 a form that you can use to tell the court why you think you 
 did satisfactorily complete the program. If the court agrees 
 with you, it will order your probation and program records 
 sealed. Because probation did not seal any arrest records at 
 this time, you may want to ask the court to seal any other 
 records relating to this conduct when you are eligible to ask 
 for record sealing as explained on this form. If you have more than one juvenile case or contact and/or 
 are unsure if your records were sealed by the court, ask 
 your attorney or probation officer or the juvenile court 
 clerk in the county where you had a case or contact. Who qualifies to ask the court to seal their juvenile records? If the court has not already sealed your records, you can ask the court to make that order, if: Ł You are at least 18 or it has been at least five years since your case was closed; andŁ You have been rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the court. What if you owe restitution or fines? The court may seal your records even if you have not paid 
 your full restitution order to the victim. 
 The court will not consider outstanding fines and court 
 ordered fees when deciding whether to seal your records, 
 but you are still required to pay the restitution, fines, and 
 fees, and your records can be looked at to enforce those 
 orders. When do you not qualify to seal your records? Ł A sex or serious drug crime; Murder or other violent crime; or Forgery, welfare fraud, or other crime of dishonesty. If you were convicted as an adult of an offense involving moral turpitude, such as: Ł If, when you were 14 or older, the court found that you committed a sex offense listed in Welfare and 
 Institutions Code section 707 (b) for which you must 
 register under Penal Code section 290. 008 because you 
 were paroled from the Department of Juvenile facilities. If you are unsure if you qualify, ask your attorney. Who can see your sealed records? Ł DMV can see your vehicle and traffic records and 
 share them with insurance companies. Ł The court may see your records if you are a witness 
 or involved in a defamation case. Ł If you apply for benefits as a nonminor dependent, 
 the court may see your records. Ł A prosecuting attorney may see your records that were sealed for an offense listed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 (b) in a later proceeding 
 for the reasons listed in section 781 (d) . Rev. January 1, 2021 How to Ask the Court to Seal Your Records JV 595 INFO, Page 2 of 3 JV 595 INFOHow to Ask the Court to Seal Your RecordsŁ If your sealed record was for a 707 (b) offense when you were 14 or older, the prosecutor, probation, and the 
 court may unseal your records if you are charged with a 
 later felony. Ł You can request the court to unseal your records if 
 you want to have access to them or allow someone 
 else to see them. Ł If a prosecutor thinks something in your record would 
 be helpful to the defense of someone who is charged 
 with a crime in another case, the prosecutor can ask the 
 court to provide that information. Ł If you want to see your records or allow someone else 
 to see them, you can ask the court to unseal them. Can employers see your records if they are 
 not sealed? Juvenile records are not allowed to be disclosed to most 
 employers, and employers are not allowed to ask about or 
 consider your juvenile history in most cases. There are 
 exceptions to this rule if you are applying to be a peace 
 officer or to work in health settings. €Also, federal 
 employers may still have access to your juvenile history. € 
 You should seek legal advice if you have questions of what 
 an employer can ask about you. How do you ask to have your records sealed? 1 You must fill out a court form. Form JV 595, Request to Seal Juvenile Records, at , can be used, or your 
 court may have a local form. 2 When you file your petition, the probation department 
 will compile a list of every law enforcement agency, 
 entity, or person the probation department knows has a 
 record of your case, as well as a list of any prior 
 contacts with law enforcement or probation, and attach 
 it to your petition. 3 If you think there are agencies that might have records 
 on you that were never sent to probation, you need to 
 name those agencies, or the court will not know to seal 
 those records. If you are not sure what contacts you might have had with law enforcement, you can get your criminal history 
 record from the Department of Justice. See http: //oag. ca. gov/fingerprints/security for more information. 4 Take your completed form to the probation department 
 where you were on probation. (If you were not on 
 probation, take your form to any county probation 
 office where you have a juvenile record. ) Note: A small 
 number of counties require you to take your form to the 
 court. More information on each county™s specific 
 requirements is available at 
 www. courts. ca. gov/28120. htm. 5 Probation will review your form and submit it to the 
 court within 90 days, or 180 days if you have records in 
 two or more counties. 6 The court will review your petition. The court may 
 decide right away to seal your juvenile records, or the 
 court may order a hearing. If there is a hearing, you will 
 receive a notice in the mail with the date, time, and 
 location of the hearing. If the notice says your hearing is 
 ﬁunopposedﬂ (meaning there is no disagreement with 
 your request) , you may choose not to go. 7 If you qualify to have your juvenile records sealed, the 
 court will make an order to seal the eligible records 
 listed on your petition. 
 Important! The court can seal only records it knows 
 about. Make sure you list all records from all 
 counties where you have any records. The court will 
 tell you if it does not seal records from another court 
 that were listed on your petition, and you will need 
 to file a petition in that county to seal those records. 8 If the court grants your request, it will order each 
 agency, entity, or person on your list to seal your 
 records. The court will also order the records destroyed 
 by a certain date. If the sealed records are for a 707 (b) 
 offense committed when you were 14 or older, the court 
 will not order those records destroyed. 9 The court will provide you with a copy of its order. Be 
 sure to keep it in a safe place. What about sex offender registration? 
 (Penal Code, § 290) If the court seals a record that required you to register as a 
 sex offender, the order will say you do not have to continue to register. Rev. January 1, 2021 How to Ask the Court to Seal Your Records JV 595 INFO, Page 3 of 3 JV 595 INFOHow to Ask the Court to Seal Your Records If your records are sealed, do you have to report the offenses in the sealed records on 
 job, school, or other applications? No. Once your records are sealed, the law treats those 
 offenses as if they did not occur and you do not need to 
 report them. However, the military and some federal agencies may not recognize sealing of records and may be 
 aware of your juvenile justice history, even if your records 
 are sealed. If you want to enlist in the military or apply for 
 a job requiring you to provide information about your 
 juvenile records, seek legal advice about this issue. Questions? If you are not sure if you qualify to seal your records or if 
 you have other questions, talk to a lawyer. The court is not 
 allowed to give you legal advice. More information about 
 sealing your records can be found at
