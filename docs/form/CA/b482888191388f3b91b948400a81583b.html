      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: What is a Domestic Violence Restraining Order? It is a court order that can help protect people who have 
 been abused or threatened with abuse. Judicial Council of California, www. courts. ca. gov Revised July 1, 2016 DV 120 INFO, Page 1 of 2 How Can I Respond to a Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order? (Domestic Violence Prevention) What does the order do? The court can order you to: Not contact or harm the protected person, including 
 children or others listed as protected peopleŁ Stay away from all protected peopleŁ Who can ask for a domestic violence 
 restraining order? The person requesting the order must have a relationship 
 with you: I've been served with a request for domestic 
 violence restraining order. What do I do 
 now? Read the papers very carefully. You must follow all the 
 orders the judge made. The Notice of Court Hearing tells you when to appear in court. You should go to the hearing, 
 if you do not agree to the orders requested. If you do not 
 go to the hearing, the judge can make orders against you 
 without hearing from you. Is there a cost to file my Response (Form 
 DV 120) ? No. DV 120 INFOHow Can I Respond to a Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order? Not have any guns or ammunitionŁ Move out of the place that you share with the protected personŁ Follow custody and visitation ordersŁ Pay child supportŁ Pay spousal supportŁ Obey property ordersŁ Follow other types of orders (listed on Form DV 100) Ł Someone you date or used to dateŁ Married, registered domestic partners, separated, 
 engaged, or divorcedŁ Someone you live or lived with (more than just a 
 roommate) Ł A parent, grandparent, sibling, child, or grandchild related by blood, marriage, or adoptionŁ What if I don't obey the order? The police can arrest you. You can go to jail and pay a fine. You must still follow the orders even if you are not 
 a U. S. citizen. If you are worried about your immigration 
 status, talk to an immigration lawyer. How long does the order last? If there is a Temporary Restraining Order in effect, it will last until the hearing date. At the hearing, the judge 
 will decide whether to extend the order or cancel the 
 order. The judge can extend the order for up to five 
 years. Custody, visitation, child support, and spousal 
 support orders can last longer than five years and they do 
 not end when the restraining order ends. What if I don't agree with what the order 
 says? You still must obey the orders until the hearing. If you do 
 NOT agree with the orders the person is asking for, fill 
 out Form DV 120, Response to Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order. After you fill out the form, file it with the court clerk and ﬁserveﬂ the form on the 
 person asking for the restraining order. ﬁServeﬂ means to 
 have someone 18 years or older not you mail a copy to the other party. The person who serves your form must 
 fill out Form DV 250, Proof of Service by Mail. After Form DV 250 is completed, make sure it is filed with the 
 court clerk. You will also have a chance at the hearing to 
 tell your side of the story. For more information on how 
 to prepare for the hearing, read Form DV 520 INFO, Get Ready for the Restraining Order Court Hearing. What if I also have criminal charges against 
 me? See a lawyer. Anything you say or write, including in 
 this case, can be used against you in your criminal case. Abuse can be physical or emotional. It can be spoken or 
 written. Revised July 1, 2016 What if I do not speak English? When you file Form DV 120, ask the court clerk if a court interpreter is available for your hearing. If an interpreter is not available, bring someone to interpret for you. Do NOT 
 ask a child, a witness, or anyone to be protected by the 
 order to interpret for you. What if I have a gun or ammunition? If a restraining order is issued, you cannot own, possess, 
 or have a gun, other firearm, or ammunition while the 
 order is in effect. If you have a gun or other firearm in 
 your immediate possession or control, you must sell it to, 
 or store it with, a licensed gun dealer, or turn it in to a law 
 enforcement agency. You must also prove to the court that 
 you turned in or sold your gun. Read Form DV 800 INFO, How Do I Turn In, Sell, or Store My Firearms? , for more information. What if I am deaf or hard of hearing? DV 120 INFO, Page 2 of 2 How Can I Respond to a Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order? (Domestic Violence Prevention) How Can I Respond to a Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order? DV 120 INFODo I need a lawyer? You are not entitled to a free court appointed lawyer for this case but having a lawyer represent you or getting 
 legal advice from a lawyer is a good idea, especially if 
 you have children. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you can 
 represent yourself. There is free or low cost help available 
 in every county. For help, ask the court clerk how to find 
 free or low cost legal services and self help centers in 
 your area. You can also get free help with child support at 
 your local family law facilitator's office. office or go to www. courts. ca. gov/forms for Request for Accommodations by Persons With Disabilities and

 assisted real time captioning, or sign 
 language interpreter services 
 are available if you ask at least five days 
 before the proceeding. Contact the clerks™Can I use the restraining order to get 
 divorced or terminate a domestic 
 partnership? No. These forms will not end your marriage or registered 
 domestic partnership. You must file other forms to end 
 your marriage or registered domestic partnership. What if I have children with the other 
 person? The judge can make temporary orders for child custody 
 and visitation. If the judge makes a temporary order for 
 child custody, the parent with custody may not remove 
 the child from California before notice to the other parent 
 and a court hearing. Read the order for any other 
 restrictions. There may be some exceptions. Ask a 
 lawyer for more information. What if I want to leave the county or state? You must still comply with the restraining order, 
 including custody and visitation orders. The restraining 
 order is valid anywhere in the United States. Will I see the person who asked for the 
 order at the court hearing? Yes. Assume that the person who is asking for the order 
 will attend the hearing. Do not talk to him or her unless 
 the judge or that person's attorney says that you can. Any 
 temporary restraining order made by the court is in effect 
 until the end of the hearing. What if I am a victim of domestic violence? For a referral to a local domestic violence or legal 
 assistance program, call the National Domestic Violence 
 Hotline: For help in your area, contact: 1 800 799 7233 
 TDD: 1 800 787 3224 It™s free and private.

 the other person? Do not use this form to request a domestic violence 
 restraining order. For information on how to file your 
 own restraining order, read Form DV 505 INFO. You can also ask the court clerk about free or low cost legal 
 help. </div>
