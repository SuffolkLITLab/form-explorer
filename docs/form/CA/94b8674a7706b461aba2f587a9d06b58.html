Gun Violence Restraining Order  
After Hearing on EPO-002 
(CLETS-HGV) (Gun Violence Prevention)

GV-030,  Page 1 of 5

Case Number:

5

Findings

a.

The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the following are true:

(1) The Restrained Person poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to themself or another 
person by having in their custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving firearms, 
firearm parts (any receiver, frame, or unfinished receiver or frame as defined in Penal Code section 
16531), ammunition, or magazines.
A gun violence restraining order is necessary to prevent personal injury to the Restrained Person or to 
another person because less restrictive alternatives either have been tried and found to be ineffective, 
or have been determined to be inadequate or inappropriate for the current circumstances.

(2)

(3)

(4)

The court has received credible information that the Restrained Person owns or possesses one or 
more firearms, firearm parts, ammunition, or one or more magazines.

The facts as stated in the Gun Violence Emergency Protective Order (form EPO-002) and 
supporting documents submitted at the time of the hearing, which are incorporated here by 
reference, and for the reasons set forth below, establish sufficient grounds for the issuance of this 
Order. 

See the attached Attachment (form MC-025)

b.

A gun violence restraining order is not being issued for the reasons below:

Case Number:

a. You cannot have in your custody or control, own, purchase, possess, or receive, or attempt to purchase or 

receive, any prohibited items listed below in b.

b.

Firearms (guns);

Prohibited items are:
(1)
(2) Firearm parts (any receiver, frame, or unfinished receiver or frame as defined in Penal Code section 16531);
(3) Ammunition; and
(4) Magazines (ammunition feeding devices).

c. You must surrender (turn in, sell, or store) all prohibited items in your custody or control or that you possess or 
own. If a law enforcement officer asks you to turn over prohibited items, you must do so immediately. If no 
request is made by a law enforcement officer, you must surrender all prohibited items within 24 hours of being 
served with this Order. You may surrender these items by turning them in to law enforcement, selling them to a 
licensed gun dealer, or storing them with a licensed gun dealer for as long as this Order or any more permanent 
order granted at the hearing in item      is in effect.
Within 48 hours of receiving this Order, you must file a receipt with the court that proves that all your prohibited 
items have been turned in, sold, or stored. (You may use Receipt for Firearms, Firearm Parts, Ammunition, and 
Magazines (form GV-800) for the receipt.) You must also file a copy of the receipt with the law enforcement 
agency that served you with this order. FAILURE TO FILE THIS RECEIPT IS A VIOLATION OF THIS 
ORDER.

Judicial Officer

To the restrained person: This order will last until the expiration date and time noted on    
page 1. If you have not done so already, you must surrender all firearms, ammunition, and 
magazines that you own or possess in accordance with section 18120 of the Penal Code. You 
may not have in your custody or control, own, purchase, possess, or receive, or attempt to 
purchase or receive a firearm, ammunition, or magazine, while this Order is in effect. Pursuant 
to section 18185, you have the right to request a hearing on an annual basis to terminate this 
Order during its effective period. You may seek the advice of an attorney as to any matter 
connected with the order.

Rev. January 1, 2023

GV-030, Page 3 of 5

Gun Violence Restraining Order  
After Hearing on EPO-002 
(CLETS-HGV) (Gun Violence Prevention)

Case Number:

Violation of this Order is a misdemeanor punishable by a $1,000 fine or imprisonment for six 
months or both. (Pen. Code, §§ 19, 18205.) If you violate this Order, you will be prohibited 
from having in your custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving, or 
attempting to purchase or receive, any prohibited items listed in item 6b, above, for a period 
of up to five years. This Order must be enforced by any law enforcement officer in the state of 
California who is aware of or shown a copy of this Order. The Order remains enforceable 
regardless of the acts of the parties; it may be terminated only by an order of the court.

Instructions for Law Enforcement

Duties of Officer Serving This Order
The officer who serves this order on the Restrained Person must do the following:

•

Ask if the Restrained Person is in possession of any of the prohibited items listed in item 6b, above, or has 
custody or control of any of those items that they have not already turned in.
•   Order the Restrained Person to immediately surrender to you all prohibited items.
•   Issue a receipt to the Restrained Person for all prohibited items that have been surrendered.
•   Complete a proof of personal service and file it with the court. You may use form GV-200 for this purpose. 
•   Within one business day of service, submit the proof of service directly into the California Restraining and 
Protective Order System (CARPOS), including the serving officer’s name and law enforcement agency.

Duties of Agency on Surrender of Firearms, Firearm Parts, Ammunition, and Magazines
The law enforcement agency that has received the surrendered prohibited items listed in item 6b, above, must do the 
following:

•  Retain the prohibited items until the expiration of this Order or of any other gun violence restraining order 

issued by the court. 

•  On the expiration of this order or of any later gun violence restraining order issued by the court, return the 

prohibited items to the Restrained Person as provided by chapter 2 of division 11 of title 4 of the Penal Code 
(commencing with section 33850). Section 34000 provides for the sale or destruction of any unclaimed items.

• 

If someone other than the Restrained Person claims title to any of the prohibited items surrendered, determine 
whether that person is the lawful owner. If so, return the prohibited items to that person as provided by chapter 2 
of division 11 of title 4 of the Penal Code (commencing with section 33850).

Enforcing This Order
The law enforcement officer should determine if the Restrained Person had notice of the order. Consider the Restrained 
Person “served” (given notice) if:

•  The officer sees a copy of the proof of service or confirms that the proof of service is on file;
• 
• 

The Restrained Person was informed of the order by an officer; or
Item 7a is checked, indicating the Restrained Person was present in court at the time the order was issued.

Instructions for Law Enforcement
(continued)

An officer can obtain information about the contents of the order and proof of service in CARPOS. If proof of service on
