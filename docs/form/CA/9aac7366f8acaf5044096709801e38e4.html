      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: Can a Restraining Order to Prevent Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Help Me? (Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Prevention) 
 What is a restraining order? It is a court order that helps protect people from 
 being abused. 
 Can I get a restraining order? If you are a person 65 years or older or a dependent 
 
 adult, you can ask for a restraining order if you have 
 been or are being: Ł Physically abusedŁ Financially abusedŁ Mentally or emotionally abused
 Ł Neglected
 Ł Abandoned or abducted
 Ł Isolated, 
 orŁ Deprived by a caregiver 
 of goods or services you
 needed to avoid harm or suffering
 How will the order help me? The court can order a person to
 : Ł Not physically abuse, har
 ass, hit, or threaten you
 Ł Not contact or go near you, 
 and
 Ł Not have a gun
 Judicial Council of California 
 www. courts. ca. gov
 Revised January 1, 2012, Optional Form
 Welfare & Institutions Code, § 15657. 03
 You can also ask for protection for people who live 
 with you and family members. 
 EA 100 INFO, 
 Page 1 of 3
 EA 100 INFO
 Can a Restraining Order to Prevent Elder or Dependent 
 Adult Abuse Help Me? These instructions cannot cover all of the questions that may arise in a particular case. If you 
 do not know what to do to protect your rights, you should see a lawyer. 
 Who can apply for an elder or dependent adult abuse restraining order? In addition to the elder 
 or dependent adult, the 
 following persons may apply for a restraining order on 
 behalf of the elder or dependent adult: 
 Ł A conservator or trustee of the elder or dependent 
 adult
 Ł An attorney in fact of an elder or dependent adult 
 who acts within the authority of the power of 
 attorney
 Ł A person appointed as a gu
 ardian ad litem for the 
 elder or dependent adult
 Ł Any other person legally authorized to seek such 
 relief. 
 How much does it cost? There is no fee for filing a request for a restraining order. 
 The court can make the person who loses the case pay all 
 the court fees and the lawyer™s fees for the other party. 
 You do not need to pay a fee for service of the order. A 
 sheriff or marshal will serve th
 e order for free. Or you may 
 arrange for service by a regist
 ered process server or a private 
 party and pay any fee that is charged. 
 What forms do I need to get the order? You must fill out all of Form EA 100, 
 Request for Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Restraining Orders, and Form 
 CLETS 001, 
 Confidential CLETS Information. 
 If you need 
 attachments, you may use Form MC 025, Attachment. You 
 must also fill out items 1 and 2 on Form EA 109, 
 Notice of Court Hearing, 
 and items 1, 2, and 3 on Form EA 110, 
 Temporary Restraining Order. Where can I get these forms? You can get the forms from legal publishers or on the 
 
 Internet at 
 www. courts. ca. gov. You also may be able to find 
 them at your local courthouse or county law library. 
 What do I need to do to get the order? You must go to the superior 
 court in the county where the 
 abuse took place or the person to
 be restrained lives. At the 
 court, ask where you should file your request for a 
 restraining order. (A self help center or legal aid association 
 may be able to assist you 
 in filing your request. ) 
 At the court, give your forms 
 to the clerk of the court. The 
 clerk will give you a hearing date on the 
 Notice of Court Hearing form, and if your request for immediate orders is 
 granted, a copy of the 
 Temporary Restraining Order
 signed by a judicial officer. How soon can I get the order? ŁIf you ask for a temporary restraining order, the court will 
 
 decide within 24 hours whether or not to make the order. 
 Sometimes the court decides sooner. Ask whether you 
 should wait or come back later to get the signed 
 Notice of Court Hearing and Temporary Restraining Order
 . Do I have to go to court? Yes. Go to court on the date the clerk gives you. 
 Do I need a lawyer? Do I need to bring a witness to the court hearing? Witnesses are not required, but it helps to have more 
 proof of the abuse than just your word. You can bring: 
 Ł Witnesses
 Ł Written statements from witnesses made under oath
 Ł Photos
 Ł Medical or police reports
 Ł Damaged property
 Ł Threatening letters, e ma
 ils, or telephone messages Can I bring someone with me to court? Yes. You can bring someone to sit with you during the 
 hearing. But that person cannot 
 speak for you in court. Only 
 you or your lawyer (if you have one) can speak for you. 
 Rev. January 1, 2012
 The court may or may not 
 let witnesses speak at the 
 hearing. So, if possible, you should bring their written 
 statements under oath to th
 e hearing. (You can use 
 Form MC 030 for this. ) 
 EA 100 INFO EA 100- INFO, 
 Page 2 of 3 Can a Restraining Order to Prevent Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Help Me? Having a lawyer is always a good idea, but it is not 
 required and you are not entitled to a free 
 court appointed attorney. Ask the court clerk about 
 free and low cost legal services and self help centers in 
 
 your county
 . Can a Restraining Order to Prevent Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Help Me? 
 (Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse Prevention) 
 How long does the order last? 
 If the court makes a temporary order, it will last until 
 your hearing date. At that time, the court will decide 
 
 to continue or cancel the 
 order. The order could last 
 for up to five years. 
 How will the person to be restrained know about the order? Someone age 18 or olderŠ
 not you or anyone else to 
 be protected by the orderŠ
 must ﬁserveﬂ (give) the 
 person to be restrained a copy of the order. The server 
 must then fill ou
 t Form EA 200, 
 Proof of Personal Service, 
 and give it to you to file with the court. For 
 help with service, ask 
 the court clerk for Form EA 200 INFO, What Is ﬁPro
 of of Personal Service? ﬂ. What if the restrained person does not obey the order? Call the police. The restrained person can be arrested 
 and charged with a crime. 
 Will I see the restrained person at the court hearing? If the person comes to the hearing, yes. But that person does 
 not have the right to speak to 
 you. If you are afraid, tell the 
 court officer. What if I don't speak English? When you file your papers, ask the clerk if a court interpreter 
 is available. You may have to pa
 y a fee for the interpreter. If 
 an interpreter is not available 
 for your court date, you should 
 ask someone who is not listed as 
 a person to be protected on 
 your Request and who is over age 18 to interpret for you

 For help in your area, contact: [Local information may be inserted. ] 
 Can I agree with the restrained person to cancel the order? No. Once the order is issued, 
 only the judge can change or 
 cancel it. You or the restrained 
 person would have to file a 
 request with the court to cancel the order. 
 What if I am deaf or hard of hearing? Assistive listening systems, computer assisted real time 
 captioning, or sign language interpreter 
 
 services are available if you ask at 
 least five days before the hearing.
