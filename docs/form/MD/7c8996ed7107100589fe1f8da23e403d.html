JOHN P. MORRISSEY
 
    
  Chief Judge 

DISTRICT COURT OF MARYLAND 

187 Harry S Truman Parkway, 5th Floor 
Annapolis, Maryland 21401 

 

Tel: (410) 260-1525 
Fax: (410) 260-1375 

 

 
TO:  All Law Enforcement Officers of the State of Maryland 

 
Authorized to Issue Citations for Violations of the Natural Resources Laws 

    December 31, 2022 

 

The attached list is a fine or penalty deposit schedule for certain violations of the Natural Resources laws. The amounts set out on this 
schedule are to be inserted by you in the appropriate space on the citation. A defendant who does not care to contest guilt may prepay the fine 
in that amount. The fine schedule is applicable whether the charge is made by citation, a statement of charges, or by way of criminal 
information. 

 

 

 

For some violations, a defendant must stand trial and is not permitted to prepay a fine or penalty deposit. Additionally, there may be 

some offenses for which there is no fine listed. In both cases, you should check the box which indicates that the defendant must appear in 
court on the offense. 

 

 

I understand that this fine schedule has been approved for legal sufficiency by the Office of the Attorney General, Department of 

 

Natural Resources. This schedule has, therefore, been adopted pursuant to the authority vested in the Chief Judge of the District Court by the 
Constitution and laws of the State of Maryland. It is effective January 1, 2023 replacing all schedules issued prior hereto, and is to remain in 
force and effect until amended or repealed. 

 

 

 

No law enforcement officer in the State is authorized to deviate from this schedule in any case in which they are involved. Your 

 

 

cooperation is appreciated. 

Very truly yours, 

John P. Morrissey 
Chief Judge 

District Court of Maryland
 
 

Attachment

The prepayable fine amounts listed below are to be utilized by all law enforcement officers and District Court Commissioners when issuing charging documents in the District Court which charge a violation of any of the

the charging document must require the defendant to appear. If a violator is charged with a second or subsequent violation, the charging document shall require the defendant to appear. Court costs are included in the 
prepayable fine amount listed below, but not in the maximum penalty amount. This schedule is effective  January 1st, 2023

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
