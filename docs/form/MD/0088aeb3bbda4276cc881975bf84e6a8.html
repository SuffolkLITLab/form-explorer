Case No. 

Respondent 

CONSENT OF PARENT TO AN INDEPENDENT ADOPTION WITH 
TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS (FORM 9-102.3) 

CONSENT OF PARENT TO ADOPTION OF 

Independent Adoption with Termination of Parental Rights 

INSTRUCTIONS 

These instructions and attached consent form may be used only in independent adoptions, not those that 

are arranged by an adoption agency. This form should only be used for a parent whose parental rights are 
being terminated. It should not be used for a parent who is retaining parental rights, for example, a 
custodial parent in a step-parent adoption. Code, Family Law Article, Title 5, Subtitle 3b. 

The attached consent form is an important legal document. You must read all of these instructions 
BEFORE you sign the consent form. If you do not understand the instructions or the consent form, 
you should not sign it. If you are under 18 years old or if you have a disability that makes it difficult 
for you to understand, do not sign the consent form unless you have a lawyer. 

A. Right to Have This Information in A Language You Understand

You have the right to have these instructions and the consent form translated into a language that you 
understand. If you cannot read or understand English, you should not sign the consent form. You should 
have this form translated for you into a language you do understand. The translated consent form is the one 
you should read and decide whether or not to sign. Any translation must have an affidavit attached in which 
the translator states that it is a true and accurate translation of this document. 

B. Right to Speak With a Lawyer

You have the right to speak with a lawyer before you decide whether or not to consent. 

You should not sign the consent form without a lawyer if you are under 18 years old or have a disability that 
makes it difficult for you to understand this document. If you are under 18 years old or have a disability that 
makes it difficult for you to understand this document, you are required to have a lawyer review the form 
with you before you can consent to the adoption. 

Even if you are not required to have a lawyer, you have the right to speak with a lawyer you choose before 
you decide whether to consent. 

You can ask the court to require the people adopting your child to pay the costs of the lawyer. The judge 
does not have to grant that request but may do so. 

CC-DR-101 (Rev. 01/2022)

Page 1 of 7 

C. Right to Adoption Counseling

You have the right to receive adoption counseling and guidance. The court may require the adoptive parents 
to pay for the adoption counseling and guidance but does not have to do so. If you want adoption counseling 
or guidance, you should not complete this consent form until after you have gotten adoption counseling or 
guidance. 

D. Post-Adoption Agreement

If you have made a written agreement with the adoptive parents for future contact (known as a post-
adoption agreement), a copy of that agreement must be attached to the signed consent form. If you have a 
post-adoption agreement, and, after the adoption, the adoptive parents do not do what they agreed to do, it 
will not affect the adoption or your consent to the adoption. However, if that happens, you have the right to 
ask a judge to make them do what they agreed to do. The judge can order you and the adoptive parents to go 
to mediation, order the adoptive parents to do what they agreed to do, or change the agreement if the judge 
decides that it is in the child’s best interest. 

E. Effect of Signing the Consent Form

IF YOU SIGN THE CONSENT FORM, AND ADOPTION IS GRANTED, YOU WILL BE GIVING 
UP ALL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES RELATING TO THE CHILD. 
If you have a post-adoption agreement, you will keep only the rights the agreement gives you. Violation of 
the agreement will not affect your consent or the adoption. 

F. Right to Revoke Consent

If you sign the consent form and then change your mind and no longer want to consent, you have the right 
to revoke (cancel) the consent within 30 days after the date that you sign the consent form. The only 
way that you can revoke this consent is by giving a signed written revocation statement with the name, 
sex, and date of birth of the child (if you know it) to: 

Adoption Clerk, Circuit Court for 

City/County 

at 

Address 

. 

The revocation must be sent to the court, not to the lawyers or the people adopting the child. You may 
deliver your written revocation of consent in person or by mail. If it is not received by the Adoption Clerk’s 
office within 30 days after the date you signed the consent form, it will be too late, and you will not be able 
to withdraw the consent or stop the adoption from being granted. 

If you sign this consent form, and then revoke your consent, and then decide to consent to the adoption 
again, you will not be able to revoke your second consent if you give your second consent in court within 
one year of your revocation of this consent. 

CC-DR-101 (Rev. 01/2022)

G. Further Notice of Adoption Proceedings

A petition for adoption has been or will be filed in the Circuit Court for 
If you sign the consent form, your written consent will also be filed in the court. You have the right to be 
notified when the petition is filed, when any hearings are held before the adoption is granted, and if and 
when the adoption is granted. Any notices will be sent to the address given by you on the consent form, 
unless you write to the Adoption Clerk at 
your new address. You may waive (give up) your right to notice if you wish to do so. Even if you give up 
your right to notice, someone from the court may contact you if further information is needed. 

Court’s Address 

City/County 

 and give the clerk 

. 

H. Compensation

Under Maryland law, you are not allowed to charge or receive money or compensation of any kind for the 
placement for adoption of your child or for your agreement to the adoptive parent having custody of your 
child, except for (1) reasonable and customary charges or fees for adoption counseling, hospital, legal, or 
medical services, (2) reasonable expenses for transportation for medical care associated with the pregnancy 
or birth of the child, (3) reasonable expenses for food, clothing, and shelter for a birth mother if, on written 
advice of a physician, the birth mother is unable to work or otherwise support herself because of medical 
reasons associated with the pregnancy or birth of the child, and (4) reasonable expenses associated with any 
required court appearance relating to the adoption, including transportation, food, and lodging expenses. 

I. Access to Birth and Adoption Records

When your child is at least 21 years old, your child, your child’s other parent, or you may apply to the 
Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health for access to certain birth and adoption records. If you do 
not want information about you to be disclosed (given) to that person, you have the right to prevent 
disclosure by filing a disclosure veto. Attached to this document is a copy of the form that you may use if 
you want to file a disclosure veto. 

J. Adoption Search, Contact, and Reunion Services

When your child is at least 21 years old, your child, your child’s other parent or siblings, or you may apply 
to the Director of the Social Services Administration of the Maryland Department of Human Services for 
adoption search, contact, and reunion services. 

K. Rights Under the Indian Child Welfare Act

If you or your child are members of or are eligible for membership in an Indian tribe, as defined by federal 
law, you have special legal rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act. You should not sign this consent 
form if you believe this may apply to you. You should tell the person requesting the consent or the court that 
you believe that your child’s case should be handled under the Indian Child Welfare Act. 

CC-DR-101 (Rev. 01/2022)

Page 3 of 7 

L. Authorization for Access to Medical and Mental Health Records

You may be asked to sign a separate form (authorization) to allow the adoptive parents to get your child’s 
medical and mental health records or your medical and mental health records. If you agree to allow access 
to this information, the records given to the adoptive parents will not include identifying information about 
you unless identifying information was previously exchanged by agreement. 

M. Signature, Witness, and Copy

If you decide to complete and sign the consent form, you must have a witness present when you sign it. The 
witness must be someone 18 or older and should not be the child or the child’s other parent. You must 
complete and sign the form with a pen and print or type in your name, address, and telephone number. The 
witness also must sign the form and print or type in the witness’ name, address, and telephone number in the 
blanks on the last page. 

If you have a post-adoption agreement, you must attach a copy to the signed consent form. 

You have the right to receive a copy of the signed consent form. 

STOP HERE IF YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING YOU HAVE READ OR IF YOU 
WANT TO SPEAK WITH A LAWYER OR GET ADOPTION COUNSELING BEFORE YOU 
DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO SIGN THE CONSENT FORM.
