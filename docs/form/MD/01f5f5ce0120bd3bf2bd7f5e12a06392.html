This  booklet  was  developed  by  the  District  Court  of  Maryland,    in  cooperation  with  Eliot  M. 
Wagonheim,  Esquire.  Mr.  Wagonheim  is  the  author  of  The  Art  of  Getting  Paid:  The  Business 
Owner’s Guide to Collecting Debts and Managing Receivables in Maryland.

INTRODUCTION

Were you awarded money in a lawsuit (the plaintiff/judgment creditor)? This guide will help you 
collect your judgment from the defendant/judgment debtor. 

Collecting the judgment (money you are owed) can be complicated. THE COURT DOES NOT 
COLLECT THE MONEY. If the debtor will not pay the debt or work out a payment plan, in order 
to use the court process for collecting money, you must:

ou may want to talk to or hire a lawyer to help you. The Maryland Courts Help Centers provide 

free limited legal services for people who are not represented by a lawyer. Call the  
Help Center at 410-260-1392 or chat with a lawyer online at mdcourts.gov/courthelp.

First Steps 

There  are  three  (3)  options  available  to  you  to 
collect your judgment:

wages;

If you win your case, your judgment is recorded in 
the court in which you won. There is an automatic 
10-day stay (waiting period) before you can begin 
the collection process. Send the debtor a copy of 
all motions and correspondence you file with the 
court about your case.

•  Garnishing the debtor’s wages;

•  Garnishing the debtor’s bank account; or

•  Seizing the debtor’s personal property or 

real estate.

You will need information about the debtor. Do 
you know where the debtor banks? Do you know 
where they work? Do you know what property 
the debtor owns?

There are three (3) options 
available to you to collect 
your judgment:

1. Garnishing the debtor’s    

2. Garnishing the debtor’s 

bank account; or

3. Seizing the debtor’s 

personal property or real 
estate.

complete and file more forms, 

pay filing fees (if not waived), and 

possibly appear in court again.

dditional fees will be added to the judgment.

Finding the Debtor’s Assets and Income

The  first  step  to  find  the  debtor’s  assets  is  to  send  the  debtor  a  Judgment  Debtor  (Defendant) 
Information Sheet (form CC-DC-CV-114). If the debtor doesn’t return the Information Sheet to you 
with the information you request by the deadline set by law, then you may (1) require the debtor to 
answer written questions or (2) require the debtor to appear in court to answer questions under oath.

Step 1
Judgment Debtor Information Sheet (CC-DC-CV-114)
The debtor will receive a notice from the court after the entry of the judgment. The notice tells the 
debtor (1) they may receive a form from you or your attorney requesting information about their assets 
and (2) that if they send the form back as instructed with the information that you have requested 
they will not have to come to court to give the information.

You  can  send  form  CC-DC-CV-114  to  the  debtor  no  earlier  than  10  days  after  the  entry  of  the 
judgment. You cannot add to the form, but you can strike through information you do not need. You 
must keep any information returned to you confidential (such as the debtor’s social security number, 
financial account or tax information), except to pursue collection efforts authorized by law.

Step 2
Discovery in Aid of Enforcement (Md. Rules 2-633 and 3-633)
In order to take another step to learn about the debtor’s assets and income, one of these three (3) 
things must be true:

1) you decide not to use the Judgment Debtor Information Sheet;
2) the judgment debtor did not return the Judgment Debtor Information Sheet to you with the 
information you asked for within 30 days after the date the form was mailed or otherwise 
delivered to the judgment debtor; or

3) the judgment debtor did properly complete and return the Judgment Debtor Information 

Sheet; and
• 
• 

it has been at least one (1) year since the entry of the judgment; or 
it has been less than one (1) year since the entry of the judgment but the court has 
given you permission to file interrogatories (questions) or request a hearing (oral 
examination).

If  you  qualify,  the  next  step  is  either  Written  Interrogatories  in Aid  of  Execution  or  an  Oral 
Examination (hearing).

Written Interrogatories in Aid of Execution

Interrogatories in Aid of Execution are up to 15 written questions to the debtor about their assets 
and income. The debtor is required to answer these questions under oath. 

You may serve interrogatories on the debtor through first-class mail. 

After the debtor is served with the order signed by the judge, they have another 15 days to answer 
your interrogatories.
 

2

After you serve the debtor with the questions, send written proof of service to the court. Proof of 
service may be a letter to the court that includes the case number, your name and address, and the 
debtor’s name and address.

The purpose of these questions is to help you find the debtor’s assets that can be used to satisfy your 
judgment. The questions may cover the debtor’s bank accounts, employment, personal property, 
and real estate. 

The debtor has 15 days to answer. If you do not receive an answer in 15 days, you can file a Motion 
Compelling Answers to Interrogatories in Aid of Execution (form DC-CV-030). This motion asks 
the judge to order the debtor to answer your questions. 

After the debtor is served with the order signed by the judge, they have another 15 days to answer 
your interrogatories.

Step 3

Oral Examination in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment
No sooner than 30 days after the court enters a judgment, you may ask that the debtor appear in 
court and answer your questions. The debtor will be under oath. You may ask questions about the 
debtor’s assets and income. Complete the Request for Order Directing Judgment Debtor or Other 
Person to Appear for Examination in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment (form CC-DC-CV-032). 
The court will issue an order that tells the debtor when to appear. You have 30 days to serve the 
debtor with this order. 

At the oral examination, 
you may ask the debtor about 
real estate, cars and other 
assets owned, bank accounts 
maintained, sources of income 

received, and wages earned.

 Handling an Uncooperative Debtor

If the debtor has been properly served and will not cooperate with your attempts to discover their 
assets, you may file a Request For Show Cause Order for Contempt (form DC-CV-033). The order 
will summon the debtor to court to explain why they should not be held in contempt for ignoring your 
discovery efforts. You can only file the request for a Show Cause Order after the debtor has either: 
•      ignored written interrogatories, as well as an order from the judge requiring their answers; or

•      failed to appear for an oral examination hearing ordered by the court.
If the debtor fails to appear for the Show Cause hearing, the judge may issue a body attachment. If the
judge orders a body attachment but it is not issued on the day of the hearing, you can file a Request to
Issue a Body Attachment (form CC-DC-108). 

Before issuing a body attachment, the plaintiff must provide either:
•      proof the debtor was personally served with the order (either the order to appear or the show cause 

order, if issued).                                                         

•      proof the debtor signed for the order (either the order to appear or the show cause order, if 

issued) when served by restricted delivery mail. 
OR

•     an affidavit from a person with firsthand knowledge that the debtor has been willfully evading 

service.

The sheriff’s office will take the debtor into custody and will bring the person before the court to
explain why they did not appear. The debtor may have to post a bond for their release. The
bond will be forfeited to the State if they do not appear at the next hearing. Both parties will
receive a new hearing date.

Collecting Your Money
Once you have the information you need to garnish the debtor’s wages or bank account or seize 
the debtor’s property, you can begin the collection process.

Request for Service

The collection process requires you to file many forms, especially if you choose to use more than one 
method. You may have to select the method of service:  
•     notification by mail; 
•     through the Sheriff’s Office (or constable in Baltimore County only); or 
•     by private process server.

When you choose a method of service, you should complete a Request for Service (form DC-CV-002). 
The post office, sheriff, constable, or private process server should return the Request for Service to the 
court to certify that service has been made properly.

Fill out the case caption information - the address of the court in which you are filing the form, your 
case number, and the names of the parties. You must also fill in the addresses for both parties, required 
in the bottom left-hand corner of the form.

Garnishing the Debtor’s Wages

Garnishing the debtor’s wages means that a portion of his or her pay will be given to you each month 
until the judgment has been paid.

The first step in garnishing someone’s wages is filing a Request for Writ of Garnishment of Wages 
(form DC-CV-065). You must know the name and address of the debtor’s employer, the amount 
of your judgment, and any additional money owed to you (such as court costs and post-judgment 
interest).

If you have submitted the proper information:  
•     The clerk will issue a Writ of Garnishment. 
•     The debtor’s employer (“garnishee”) will be served with the writ instructing the garnishee to 
withhold a portion of the debtor’s wages to satisfy your judgment.  
•     The debtor/garnishee then has 30 days to file an answer to the Writ of Garnishment.  
•     You will receive a copy of the garnishee’s answer listing any other attachments, or 
garnishments, against the debtor’s wages. 

Your garnishment may not take effect immediately if the debtor has to satisfy other judgments.
Attachments are satisfied in the order in which they are served on the garnishee.

The Maryland Rules require garnishees (employers) to give the withheld wages to the judgment 
creditor within 15 days of the close of the debtor’s last pay period each month. In other words, if 
the debtor’s pay period ends March 26, you should receive the funds withheld during March, no 
later than April 10.

Your garnishment is valid as long as the debtor remains with the same employer and your 
judgment is unpaid. You are not required to refile.

Garnishing the Debtor’s  Bank Account

Garnishing a debtor’s bank account means you will be given money from the debtor’s bank 
account to help satisfy your judgment. Normally, you cannot garnish funds from:

•     jointly-held accounts (unless your judgment is against both owners), 
•     retirement accounts, 
•     escrow accounts.

Financial institutions must comply with certain requirements, prohibitions, and limitations under 
federal law. The law prohibits holding “protected amounts” such as Social Security, Veteran’s 
Administration, Railroad Retirement Board, and Office of Personnel Management (Federal 
Regulation 31 C.F.R. Part 212 and Maryland Rule 3-645.1). 

Step One in garnishing a bank account: Complete the Request for Writ of Garnishment of 
Property Other Than Wages (form DC-CV-060). You need to know the name and address of the 
debtor’s financial institution, the amount of your judgment, and any additional money owed to 
you (such as court costs and post-judgment interest). 

5

The clerk will issue a Writ of Garnishment if you provide the proper information. The debtor’s 
financial institution (“garnishee”) will be served with the writ, and a Garnishee’s Confession of 
Assets of Property Other Than Wages (form DC-CV-061). The garnishee has 30 days from the date 
of service to file the Confession of Assets with the court. You will receive a copy listing the debtor’s 
assets held.

If 30 days pass after the original Request for Writ of Garnishment of Property Other Than Wages is 
served and the garnishee has filed an answer to the request, you can file the Request for Judgment-
Garnishment (form DC-CV-062). You must mail a copy of the request to the garnishee and the 
debtor before filing the request. 

If you do not seek to enforce or dismiss the writ within 120 days after the garnishee’s answer is 
filed, after proper notice to both the judgment debtor and the judgment creditor, the garnishee may 
request to terminate the writ. 

If the judge enters a judgment in your favor, the order will direct the garnishee to give you the 
amount ordered from the debtor’s bank account.

Seizing the Debtor’s Personal Property or Real Estate

Property or real estate can be sold to help satisfy your judgment. Seizing personal property or real 
estate are the most complicated and time-consuming collection methods. You may want to consider 
hiring an attorney to assist you with the process. 

There are costs to seizing real estate or property. You are responsible for any costs associated with the 
sale. Be sure that the proceeds from the sale, minus your costs, make this procedure worth your time 
and effort.  

There are also exceptions to what can be sold. If the 
debtor’s property is jointly-owned, you cannot sell it unless 
you have a judgment against both owners.

You can, however, sell the debtor’s interest in a property. 
For example, if the debtor owns a home jointly with a 
sibling, the home cannot be sold. However, you will be 
able to sell the debtor’s interest in the home. Whoever buys 
the interest will become a joint owner with the debtor’s 
sibling. 

The debtor  is permitted to request certain other 
exemptions listed under the Notice to the Defendant on the 
reverse side of the Request for Writ of Execution.

You are responsible for 
the costs of seizing real 
estate or property. Be 
sure the proceeds from 
the sale, minus your costs, 
make this procedure worth 
YOUR TIME AND EFFORT.

File a Request for Writ of Execution (form DC-CV-040) if you choose to seize the debtor’s personal 
property or real estate. Before filing your request for writ there are steps you may be required to take. 

Real Estate
If you would like to sell the debtor’s real estate, prior to filing the Writ of Execution, you must record 
your judgment in the circuit court for the county in which the property is located (with the exception of 
Baltimore City). If you win a judgment in Baltimore City, the judgment is automatically recorded 
in the District Court as a lien on property in Baltimore City. If your judgment was entered in any 
other county, you must ﬁle the Request to File Notice of Lien (form DC-CV-035). 

6

For example, if you win your case in Prince George’s County and know that the debtor owns real 
estate there, you should complete the Notice of Lien and indicate that the property you would 
like to sell is in Prince George’s County. Fill out the case caption information, including your 
case number and the names and addresses of both parties. Under the Notice of Lien of Judgment 
section of the form, enter the date your judgment was entered, the amount that you were awarded, 
along with any attorney’s fees or court costs. Because the real estate you would like to sell is 
located in the same county in which your judgment was entered, you should check the first 
box. File the completed Notice of Lien in the Prince George’s County District Court, which will 
forward the information to the circuit court.  

If you win your case in Prince George’s County and find that the debtor owns real estate in Anne 
Arundel County, you should complete the Notice of Lien and indicate that the property you are 
interested in selling is in Anne Arundel County. Because the real estate is located in a county 
other than the one in which your judgment was entered, check the second box and enter the 
name of the county where the property is located. File the completed Notice of Lien in the Prince 
George’s County District Court, which will forward the information to the correct circuit court.

7

If you are trying to seize real estate in a county other than the one in which your judgment was 
entered, complete the Request for Transmittal of Judgment (form DC-CV-034). Include the name 
of the county in which you would like your judgment recorded (Anne Arundel in the example 
above). 

Personal Property

If you intend to seize personal property, such as a car or a boat, in a county other than the one in which 
you won your judgment, complete the Request for Transmittal of Judgment (form DC-CV-034). When 
filling out the form, put the name of the county in which you would like your judgment recorded. 

Writ of Execution

The court will send you a notice once your judgment has been recorded properly. At this point, 
you may file the Request for Writ of Execution (form DC-CV-040). You should file the Writ of 
Execution in the county in which the property you intend to seize is located. 

When you file this request, you are asking the court to have the debtor’s property levied or seized 
to satisfy your judgment. In most counties, the sheriff’s office is responsible for levying or seizing 
property. In Baltimore County, constables perform these duties.

If you choose to seize the debtor’s car, you are required to file a copy of the title with the 
Request for Writ of Execution. The copy cannot be more than 90 days old when you file your 
request. Contact the Motor Vehicle Administration to find out how to obtain a copy of the title and 
for information about the fees involved.

If you choose to seize the debtor’s real estate, you must have a copy of the deed. Deeds are 
public records that can be found at the circuit court for the county in which the real estate is 
located. Use the legal description found on the deed for the description of the property when 
completing the Request for Writ of Execution.

In the top half of the Request for Writ of Execution, you should enter: (1) the amount of money 
that is owed to you, (2) the debtor’s last known address, and (3) the location of the property to be 
levied and a detailed description of the property. Be specific.

The next question deals with what you would like the sheriff to do with the property.  
•     Select “leave the property where found” to have the sheriff post a notice alerting the debtor 
that the property has been levied. If you would like to sell the property, you must have it seized.

•     Select “exclude others from access to it or use of it,” to have the sheriff leave the property 
but render it inaccessible. For instance, the debtor can be barred from using their car. You may be 
required to post a bond with the sheriff if you choose this option.

•     Select “remove it from the premises,” to have the sheriff remove the property. The sheriff’s 
office will use the bond to meet its costs; any unused portion will be returned to you.

8

There is a 30-day waiting period before property can be sold. The waiting period allows the 
debtor the opportunity to file a motion to request that the property be exempted.

If no motion is filed after the 30 days, you must contact the sheriff to start the sale of the property. 
If after 120 days, the sales process has not started, the property may be released to the debtor.

Judgment Creditor’s Monthly Report

You are required to document any payments. Send a Judgment Creditor’s Monthly Report to the 
debtor and any garnishees within 15 days after the end of each calendar month in which you receive 
a payment. Do not file the Judgment Creditor’s Monthly Report with the District Court. A sample 
form is posted for your convenience at: mdcourts.gov/district/forms/civil/dccv066.pdf

Renewing Your Judgment

A judgment is only valid 
for 12 years, but can 
be renewed by filing 
a request to renew 
judgment with the court.

 In Maryland, a judgment is only valid for 12 years.  
If you have not been able to collect your judgment 
within that time, you will have to renew the judgment 
to continue your collection efforts. Complete the 
Request to Renew Judgment (form DC-CV-023) 
and file it with the court. The renewal form must be 
completed while your judgment is still valid. For 
example, if your judgment was entered on February 1, 
2006, your judgment is valid until February 1, 2018. 

If you file a renewal of judgment on February 2, 2018, your judgment has expired and will no 
longer be honored.

Notice of Satisfaction

When your judgment has been paid in full, you must file a Notice of Satisfaction (form DC-CV-031). 
The clerk will process the order and notify each court which recorded the judgment.

If you do not file the Notice of Satisfaction and the debtor files a Motion for Order Declaring the 
Judgment Satisﬁed (form DC-CV-051), the court can order you to reimburse the debtor for any 
costs incurred.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
