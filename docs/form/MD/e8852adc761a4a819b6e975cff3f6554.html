Tenants 
Can Resolve 
Disputes 
with 
Landlords

for Tenants      
Information 

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
DO I NEED A LAWYER?
In some instances, corporations and certain other 
business entities must be represented by an 
attorney. Otherwise, you are not required to have 
a lawyer, although one could be helpful to you.

WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?
When both sides appear: the court will hear 
both sides of a case and make a decision. If the 
landlord wins, the court will enter a judgment 
of possession, and if there was personal service 
on the tenant, the court may also issue a money 
judgment in the amount of rent and costs due.

When the landlord fails to appear: the court 
will most likely dismiss the case.

When the tenant fails to appear: the court will 
most likely enter a judgment in favor of the 
landlord.

WHAT SHOULD I BRING WITH ME TO 
COURT? You should bring all of your evidence, 
that is, whatever you have that you believe 
would support your claim or defense. 

HOW DO I REQUEST A POSTPONEMENT? 
You should make your request in writing prior to 
the court date, send a copy of your request to the 
opposing party, and certify that you have done so.  
However, you may also request a postponement in 
court on the trial date. 

HOW DOES THE EVICTION PROCESS 
WORK? In a Failure to Pay Rent case, if the tenant 
does not pay all rent and costs determined by the 
court to be due, the tenant may be evicted. If a 
landlord has obtained a judgment of possession, a 
request for a Warrant of Restitution must be filed 
within 60 days of the judgment or the expiration of 
any stay of execution.

Generally, the tenant may prevent eviction by 
paying all rent and costs due at any time before 
the eviction. This is known as the tenant's right 
of redemption.

Exception: Foreclosure of the right of 
redemption: If there have been 3 prior 
judgments for possession (4 in Baltimore City) 
in the preceding 12 months, the court may 
foreclose (deny) the right of redemption. 

WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS TO A JURY 
TRIAL?
Jury trials are held in the circuit court, not the 
District Court. If the amount of the claim exceeds 
$25,000, or if the value of the tenant's interest 
in the leasehold is greater than $25,000, either 
party may request a jury trial. Jury trial requests 
must be in writing. In a residential tenancy, a 
request for a jury trial may be filed no later than 
the first appearance of the parties in District 
Court.  

HOW DO I FILE A CLAIM FOR HOUSING 
DISCRIMINATION?
Housing discrimination complaints are handled 
by the United States Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD).

NEED LEGAL HELP?
The Maryland Judiciary's Help Centers are 
staffed by trained attorneys and provide 
brief free legal advice on all civil matters, 
including questions regarding landlord/tenant 
proceedings. For more information, please 
call 410-260-1392 or visit mdcourts.gov/
helpcenter

HOW DO I FILE AN APPEAL? 
Each party has the right to appeal by filing 
an appeal on form DC-CV-037. In Failure to 
Pay Rent cases, the appeal must be filed no 
later than 4 business days after the date of 
judgment. In all other actions for possession, 
the appeal must be filed no later than 10 
calendar days after the date of judgment.  
Whether the appeal is de novo (a new trial) 
or on the record depends on the amount 
in controversy. The filing of an appeal does 
not automatically stop the eviction. Posting 
the bond ordered by the court will stop the 
eviction until the circuit court decides the 
appeal.    

MEDIATION: AN ALTERNATIVE 
The District Courtâ€™s Alternative Dispute Resolution 

Program (ADR) offers mediation free of charge.   

It is less formal, less time-consuming and less costly 

than going to court. A trained mediator will work 

with both sides to try to arrive at a mutually  

agreeable solution. If mediation is not successful, 

you may still seek a decision by the court.  

For more information on Maryland courts and 
procedures, please contact a clerk in any state or 
county courthouse or visit the Maryland Judiciary 
website:

mdcourts.gov

It is the mission of the District Court  

of Maryland to provide equal and exact  
justice for all who are involved in  
litigation before the court.

BREACH OF THE COVENANT OF 
QUIET ENJOYMENT

Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment (on DC-CV-001, 
the District Court Complaint form). 

The Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment means that 
the landlord must control disturbances to your 
peaceful enjoyment of the rental property that 
they have the ability and authority to control.

Note: the court may require that you previously 
notified the landlord of the problem and gave 
the landlord a reasonable opportunity to 
correct it.

DIMINUTION OF SERVICES BY 
LANDLORD

premises without legal authority, you can file:

Quiet Enjoyment (on DC-CV-001, the District 
Court Complaint form), or 
(b) Petition for Peace Order (DC-PO-001,  
DC-PO-001A, DC-PO-001S; see brochure  
CC-DC-DV-PO-001BR for more details), or  
(c) a criminal trespass charge.

 (

2. When landlord unlawfully locks a tenant out 
or otherwise unlawfully causes a diminution of 
services to the tenant, tenant may be entitled 
to be placed back in possession of the property, 
or an award of actual monetary damages, 
attorneys fees, and costs, depending on the 
circumstances.

What do I have to prove? 
(1) The tenancy has terminated,and (2) the 
landlord, without a reasonable basis, failed 
to return any part of the security deposit, 
plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the 
termination of the tenancy. 

Tenant's Rights:
(1) You have the right to be present at the 
inspection of the premises for damages, 
provided that you gave at least 15 days' notice 
by certified mail of your intention to move, the 
date of move, and your new address. 

(2) The landlord must send you notice by 
first-class mail directed to the last known 
address of the tenant, within 45 days after the 
termination of the tenancy, a written list of the 
damages claimed and costs actually incurred. 

What can I recover? Up to 3 times the 
amount wrongfully withheld, plus reasonable 
attorney's fees. 

  

SERIOUS HEALTH OR SAFETY 
ISSUE(S)
What to file: Complaint for Rent Escrow/
Injunction (DC-CV-083). Note: You may also 
raise a serious health or safety issue as a 
defense if your landlord files a Failure to Pay 
Rent case against you. The information below 
regarding notice and what you must prove 
still applies. 

What is covered? Conditions and defects 
that constitute a fire hazard or a serious and 
substantial threat to the life, health or safety 
of occupants, including, but not limited to: 
(1) lack of heat, light, electricity, or hot or cold 
water, except where the tenant is responsible 
for their payment and the lack thereof is the 
direct result of the tenant's failure to pay,  
(2) lack of adequate sewage disposal,  
(3) rodents in two or more dwelling units,  
(4) structural defect which presents a serious 
and substantial threat to physical safety, or  
(5) a condition which presents a health or fire 
hazard to the dwelling unit.  

Minor defects that do not constitute a health or 
safety hazard are not covered.

Do I have to do anything before filing?
Yes. You must give the landlord notice of the 
defect(s) or condition(s) by: (1) certified mail 
listing the conditions or defects, (2) actual 
notice of the defects or conditions, or (3) a 
notice from a government agency stating the 
asserted conditions or defects.

What do I have to prove?
(1) The existence of covered condition or 
defect, (2) notice to the landlord, (3) the 
landlord was given a reasonable time to make 
the repair(s) [more than 30 days is presumed 
by law to be unreasonable], and (4) the 
landlord has failed to do so.

RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES OF
THE TENANT 

Filing with the Court:
Please make sure that your paperwork is 
accurate and legible. All correspondence with 
the court after the initial filing should include 
the case number and a certification that 
you sent a copy to the landlord. The proper 
location for filing is in the county where the 
property is located. 

Specific Problems and  
Court Remedies
LANDLORD CLAIMS TENANT 
FAILED TO PAY RENT

Tenant's Rights:
Before filing a Complaint for Failure to Pay 
Rent, the landlord must send you written 
notice of their intent to file a claim in the 
District Court to recover possession of the 
residential premises if you do not pay the rent 
owed within 10 days after you are provided 
the notice.

The notice may be sent by (1) first-class mail; 
(2) affixed to the door of the premises; or (3) 
if elected by the tenant, delivered by either 
electronic mail message, text message, or 
an electronic tenant portal. At your request, 
the landlord must promptly provide you an
