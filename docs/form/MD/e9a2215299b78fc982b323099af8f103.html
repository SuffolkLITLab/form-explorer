      <pre>How to File 
a Criminal 
Complaint in 
the District 
Court of 
Maryland

Criminal Complainants

Step 5: Court

Your application for a charging document may 
lead to the arrest and detention of the defendant. 
If, as a result of your application, a charging 
document is issued by the commissioner, it 
will not be possible for the commissioner to 
withdraw the document. You cannot change 
your mind about filing the charge. The charge 
may only be disposed of by trial or by action of 
the State’s Attorney. 

You will be required to appear at the trial as a 
witness. Failure to appear on the date set by the 
court could result in your arrest for failure to 
obey a court order.

Restrictions on Release 
of Personal Information
 A complainant, victim, victim’s representative, 
or a witness may request the shielding of an 
address or a telephone number from public 
inspection for their protection in a criminal case 
due to:
•

threats to safety made by the defendant or
person(s) on defendant’s behalf;

•

•

•

an act of violence by defendant or person(s)
on defendant’s behalf;

a felony act or delinquent act that would be
a felony if committed by an adult; or

a domestically related crime under Criminal
Procedure § 6-233, or a delinquent act that 
would be a domestically related crime if 
committed by an adult. 

File a Confidential Supplement (CC-DC-CR-001S) 
form with your complaint.

An application for a charging document 
must be filed under oath. A person who 
knowingly provides false information in 
an application shall be subject to a fine of 
not more than $500, or be imprisoned not 
more than six months, or be both fined and 
imprisoned, at the discretion of the court.

Judiciary and the District Court visit the

It is the mission of the District Court 
of Maryland to provide equal and exact 
justice for all who are involved in 
litigation before the court.

Step 3: How to complete the 
application

Step 4: Issuing a summons or an 
arrest warrant

After you have signed the application, the 
commissioner reviews it to determine whether 
or not a crime has been committed and if there 
is reason to believe that the person you have 
accused, committed the crime. 

f the commissioner determines that there is 
probable cause, a charging document is issued. 
The commissioner will issue either a summons 
for the defendant to appear in court at a later 
date or a warrant for the arrest of the defendant. 

f a summons is issued, a law enforcement 
officer authorized to serve the summons will 
attempt to do so. “Serving” the summons means 
delivering it to the defendant. 

f a warrant is issued, the document will be 
given to the law enforcement agency responsible 
for finding and arresting the accused person.

When completing an Application 
for Statement of Charges, you 
must tell the Commissioner: 

•  Who

•  When

•  Where

 

•  What

•  Why

•  How
 

 

•  A description of the accused 

Since the application helps the commissioner 
determine if probable cause exists for charges to 
be filed, you must provide accurate and adequate 
information. 
 
•   Who—Under Complainant, list your name 

and contact information. 
Under Defendant identify the person you 
are accusing of committing the crime.

  
•   Description—Describe the defendant. 

Provide as much information as possible so 
that the defendant may be easily identified. 

•   When—State the time, day, month and 

year of the offense.

•   Where—State the exact address, city, 
county, and state where the offense 
happened. Also state whether the offense 
happened in a private home or in some 
public place.

•   What—State exactly what was done to 
you. For example, if property was taken, 
describe it and its value. If property was 
damaged or destroyed, indicate the original 
cost of the item or its replacement value. If 
you do not know the exact value, estimate 
it as accurately as possible.

•   Why—In explaining what happened to 

you, include any facts that would show that 
the accused intended to commit a criminal 
act. 

•   How—State how the accused committed 
the offense. For example, if you were 
assaulted, were you struck with a fist, a 
flat hand, kicked, or pushed, or were you 
struck with an object, such as a club or 
pipe, etc.? 

  

What should you do if you believe  
that crime has been committed 
against you or a minor in your custody?

Step 1: Report the crime to the  
police

If you believe that a crime has been committed 
against you or a minor in your custody, your 
first step should be reporting the crime to the 
local police department. Reporting the incident 
makes it a matter of record, even if the police are 
unable to investigate the crime. 

epending upon the nature of the incident, 
the police may conduct an investigation. The 
investigation determines whether or not charges 
are filed by the police with a District Court 
commissioner. 

f the police file charges, the matter is now under 
the authority of the court.

Step 2: File  charges with a 
District Court commissioner 

If the police do not conduct an investigation 
or file charges, you may file an Application 
for Statement of Charges on your own with a 
District Court commissioner. 

 District Court commissioner, a judicial 

officer, reviews the Application for Statement of 
Charges to decide if sufficient evidence exists to 
charge the defendant (the person accused) with a 
crime (probable cause). 

ou must tell the commissioner, in writing, the 

details of the crime.
