INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE 

STATE OF MARYLAND  

LAND INSTRUMENT  

INTAKE SHEET 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND LAND INSTRUMENT INTAKE SHEET 
 
Purpose of the Intake Sheet 

The purpose of the Intake Sheet is to provide a single form that the twenty-four (24) circuit court 
clerk  offices  will  use  to  expedite  the  accurate  processing,  recording,  and  indexing  of  land 
instruments. Further, the Intake Sheet has been designed to accommodate the information needs 
of the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) and the local finance offices. 
NOTE:  When a deed or other instrument changing ownership is submitted to SDAT for 
processing,  a  photocopy  of  the  instrument  for  SDAT,  as  well  as  the  original,  must 
accompany the Intake Sheet. 

Compliance 

In accordance with Real Property Article § 3-104(g), a completed Intake Sheet is required with 
every land instrument submitted for recordation, with the exception of releases and assignments 
of  mortgages  and  deeds  of  trust,  substitutions  of  trustees,  powers  of  attorney,  and  financing 
statements and their modifications. Section 1, Sections 3 through 5, and Sections 7 through 10 of 
the Intake Sheet must be completed for all types of instruments for which the Sheet is required. 
Sections 2, 6, and 11 also must be completed on Intake Sheets submitted with deeds. 

Preparation Instructions 

Please  print  or  type  legibly,  in  black  ink  only,  all  of  the  information  that  applies  to  your 
instrument(s)  in  the  spaces  provided.  When  printing,  press  firmly  and  always  prepare  all  four 
copies  of  the  Intake  Sheet;  the  white,  canary,  and  pink  copies  will  be  retained  by  the  clerk’s 
office, SDAT, and the local finance offices respectively. After completing the form, the preparer 
should  retain  the  goldenrod  copy  for  internal  records  and  reference  purposes.  Only  one  Intake 
Sheet should  be  completed for each transaction involving  the  same  property.  If  there  are  more 
than two instruments submitted for the same transaction, the Addendum to Intake Sheet should be 
used to itemize information relevant to grantors/grantees such as considerations, recording fees, 
and taxes. If the preparer is submitting Intake Sheets or Addendums printed through the use of 
their own computers, a sufficient number of forms should be presented with the instruments. 

Section 1:  Type(s) of Instruments 

This  Section  is  for  use  in  identifying  the  type(s)  of  instruments  to  be  recorded  and,  if  several 
instruments are being recorded, in indicating the sequence in which those instruments are to be 
recorded. Therefore, if one instrument is being recorded, place an X in the box next to the type 
of  instrument  to  be  recorded.  If  more  than  one  instrument  is  being  recorded,  number  each 
applicable  box  in  the  sequence  in  which  the  instruments  are  to  be  recorded.  Number  each 
instrument accordingly. 

 

1

For example, if you are submitting a deed and deed of trust insert a “1” in the box next to “Deed” 
and a “2” in the box next to “Deed of Trust.” 

NOTE:  If the type of instrument to be submitted is not listed, enter it under “Other.” 

NOTE:  Use a separate intake sheet for each deed and complete as Type of Instrument “1.” 

Section 2:  Conveyance Type 

This Section should only be complete if the Intake Sheet has been prepared to accompany a deed 
that should be processed by SDAT to transfer property ownership in the assessment records. The 
primary  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  distinguish  arms-length  conveyances  from  transfers  that 
have  not  had  full  exposure  to  the  marketplace.  An  arms-length  sale  is  a  transaction  between 
unrelated  parties  under  no  duress.  Please  designate  the  type  of  conveyance  by  checking  the 
appropriate box: 

Improved Sale Arms-Length:  Check this box if the property conveyed includes a 
building  or  other  relatively  permanent  structure  or  development  located  on,  or 
attached to, land. 

Unimproved  Sale  Arms-Length:  Check this box if the property conveyed  only 
consists of vacant land. 

Multiple  Accounts  Arms-Length:    Check  this  box  if  the  property  conveyed 
includes more than one account for the assessment records. 

Not  an  Arms-Length  Sale:    Check  this  box  if  the  transfer  of  the  property  was 
between related parties, or one or more of the parties were acting under duress to 
buy  or  sell.  Types  of  conveyances  that  are  not  considered  an  arms-length 
transfer  of  real  property  include  a  lease,  gift,  foreclosure,  tax  sale,  or 
confirmatory deed. 

Section 3:  Tax Exemptions 

If applicable to the transaction, list each claimed exemption for State recordation, State transfer, 
and county transfer taxes. The authority for each exemption claimed should be cited or explained 
briefly. 

Section 4:  Consideration and Tax Calculations 

This Section, together with Sections 3 and 5, is intended to reduce the rejection of instruments 
resulting from the incorrect calculation of applicable charges. It is difficult for clerks to identify 

 

2

an error when verifying charges payable without knowing the amounts used by the preparer to 
calculate taxes. 

State the amount of the purchase price or cash consideration payable. If the transaction includes 
new  secured  debt,  state  the  amount  of  the  principal  debt  secured  by  the  new  mortgage.  If  an 
existing  mortgage  is  being  assumed,  state  the  balance  due  on  the  existing  mortgage.  If  the 
transaction involves other instruments (e.g., a lease) for which separate consideration is payable, 
or the transaction involves other consideration such as forgiveness of a debt owed by the grantee 
to the grantor, state the amount of “other consideration.” If the grantor is receiving property (real 
or personal) for the conveyance, state the full cash value of the real property conveyed. 

Section 5:  Fees 

If  more  than  one  instrument  is  being  recorded,  the  information  requested  should  be  provided 
separately for each instrument with the document number corresponding to the number assigned 
in  Section  1.  Itemize  the  recording  charges,  surcharge,  State  transfer  tax,  State  recordation  tax 
and  county  transfer  tax,  if  applicable.  The  “OTHER”  category  may  be  used  to  indicate 
miscellaneous taxes that may be applicable to the transaction. The amount indicated should be 
the net amount owed. 

Section 6:  Description of Property 

In connection with deeds, this Section will be used to allow SDAT to transfer property in the 
assessment records. For other instruments, completion is optional. 

Section 6 also will be used by the clerk offices to index property identifiers in accordance with 
Real  Property  Article  §  3-104  (g)(3)(i).  Due  to  limited  database  fields,  a  maximum  of  40 
characters can be allocated for property description information. Space permitting, therefore, the 
property  identifiers  provided  on  the  Intake  Sheet  will  be  indexed  in  the  following  priority:  1) 
Property Tax Identification Number: 2) Street Address; 3) Lot, Block, and Section Numbers; 4) 
Square Footage or Acreage; and 5) the abbreviation Var. L.O.G. for “Variable Lots of Ground.” 

Whenever the Intake Sheet is submitted with a deed, SDAT and, in some cases, the local finance 
offices,  will  require  completion  of  all  property  description  information  applicable  to  the 
transaction including, in addition to the above property identifiers, the district, subdivision name, 
liber and folio of the deed by which the grantor acquired title, map number, parcel number, and 
plat reference. Some of the information for Section 6 may be obtained from the lien document 
received in the local finance/treasury office. The information also is available on public access 
terminals at the counter in local assessment offices. 

NOTE:  If more than one (1) account/property is being conveyed on a deed, list on an attachment 
all of the other property descriptors. 

 

3

District:  Indicate the numerical code that identifies the property location in an 
election/assessment district. 

Property Tax Identification Number:  Indicate the numerical code that is unique 
to  each  property  within  a  local  county.  NOTE:    If,  since  previous  July  1,  the 
property  being  transferred  has  been  established by a recorded subdivision plat, 
indicate  the  original  (former  or  parent)  account  number  for  the  tract  on  which 
the  subdivision  was  established,  except  in  Montgomery  County  where,  due  to 
that  jurisdiction’s  parcel  identifier  requirement,  the  new  identification  number 
must be listed. In Baltimore County, enter the original account number here but 
also enter the new identification number under “Other Property Identifiers.” 

NOTE:  For a property located in Baltimore City, enter the local Block and Lot 
numbers in this space. 

Grantor  Liber/Folio:    Indicate  the  liber/folio  for  the  recorded  instrument  by 
which  the  grantor  acquired  title  to  the  property.  NOTE:    If,  since  the  previous 
July  1,  the  property  being  transferred  has  been  established  by  a  recorded 
subdivision plat, indicate the liber/folio for the recorded instrument by which the 
grantor(s) acquired the tract on which the subdivision was established. 

Map:  Indicate the numeric/alpha code from SDAT Property Ownership Maps. 
NOTE:    If,  since  the  previous  July  1,  the  property  being  transferred  has  been 
established  by  a  recorded  subdivision  plat,  indicate  the  original  (former  or 
parent) map code. 

Parcel  Number:    Indicate  the  numeric/alpha  reference  delineating  the  property 
parcel  on  the  SDAT  map.  NOTE:    If,  since  the  previous  July  1,  the  property 
being  transferred  has  been  established  by  a  recorded  subdivision  plat,  indicate 
the original (former or parent) parcel number. 

Various Lots of Ground (Var. L.O.G.):  Check the box beneath the abbreviation 
Var. L.O.G. if the property consists of multiple parcels. An attachment must be 
provided that identifies all of the various lots. 

Subdivision  Name:    Indicate  the  name  of  the  subdivision,  if  any,  in  which  the 
property is located. 

Lot/Block/Section/Area:    Indicate  the  location  reference  of  the  property  in  a 
platted subdivision. 

Plat  Reference:    Indicate  the  liber/folio  reference  to  the  recorded  subdivision 
plat in which the property is located. 

 

4

Square Footage/Acreage:    Indicate  the  amount  of  square  feet  or  acreage  being 
conveyed. 

Location/Address:  Indicate the premise location or street address of the property 
being  conveyed.  NOTE:  Montgomery  County  requires  inclusion  of  the  condo 
unit number if applicable. 

Other  Property  Identifiers:  NOTE:  Baltimore  City  requires  inclusion  of  the 
name of the mortgage company in this section. 

Water  Meter  Account  No.:    NOTE:  Use  of  this  area  applies  only  to  a  property 
located in Baltimore City. 

Residential or Non-Residential:  NOTE: Montgomery County requires inclusion 
of this information. Indicate by checking the appropriate box. 

Ground  Rent  or  Fee  Simple:    NOTE:  Baltimore  City  requires  inclusion  of  this 
information.  Indicate  by  checking  the  appropriate  box  and,  if  applicable,  enter 
the amount of Ground Rent. 

Partial Conveyance:  Answer “Yes” if the property being conveyed is part of an 
existing  property  and  then  indicate  the  amount  of  square  footage  or  acreage 
being conveyed. Also list all improvements being conveyed. 

Section 7:  Transferred From 

Indicate the name(s) of the grantor(s) conveying the property. If appropriate, list the last name 
first.  Owner(s)  of  record  other  than  the  grantor(s)  should  be  listed  in  the  appropriate  space  in 
Section 6 as well. For example, if the instrument is a mortgage given by a tenant to a lender, the 
landlord (owner) should be listed. If necessary, the Addendum to the Intake Sheet should be used 
to allow all names to be listed. 

Section 8:  Transferred To 

Indicate the name(s) of the grantee(s). As appropriate, list the last name first. If necessary, the 
Addendum to the Intake Sheet should be used to allow all names to be listed. 

IMPORTANT:    To  ensure  that  the  new  assessment  is  sent  to  the  proper  person,  provide  the 
mailing address of the new owner/grantee to whom the assessment notice should be sent. 

Section 9:  Other Names to Be Indexed 

Indicate the name(s) of parties that are not listed as grantors or grantees, such as beneficiaries on 
deeds of trust, that are to be indexed. 

 

5

Section 10:  Contact/Mail Information 

This Section is included to reduce the delay occasioned by the return of an instrument because of 
a problem that can be rectified quickly and also to ensure the return of a recorded instrument to 
the proper person. 

Indicate  the  name,  firm,  address,  and  telephone  number  of  the  person  to  contact  if  the  clerk’s 
office, SDAT, or finance office has any questions about the transaction. Check the appropriate 
box to indicate whether the instrument, after recording, should be mailed to the contact person’s 
address, kept at the clerk’s office for pick-up, mailed to the address provided on the instrument, 
or mailed to the person named at the address within this Section. 

Section 11:  Assessment Information 

This  Section  should  be  completed  only  if  the  Intake  Sheet  has  been  prepared  to  accompany  a 
deed that will be processed by SDAT. Check the boxes to answer “yes” or “no” to each question. 

Principal Residence – The Grantee must actually occupy the dwelling for more 
than six (6) months of a calendar year in order for the property to qualify as a 
principal residence. This designation affects eligibility for certain tax credits. 

Personal  Property  –  If  the  transfer  involves  personal  property,  items  such  as 
trailer  homes,  boats,  equipment  inventory,  etc.  should  be  listed.  It  is  not 
necessary to include household appliances in this list. 

Survey – If the property was surveyed, a copy of the survey should be attached 
to the deed, unless the property is part of a recorded subdivision plat. 

The Addendum also provides a Section in which the preparer can give special instructions for the 
clerk offices as to recording or indexing an instrument.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
