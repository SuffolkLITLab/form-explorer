WRIT OF GARNISHMENT OF PROPERTY OTHER THAN WAGES 
(Md. Rule 3-645) 

TO THE GARNISHEE: 

You are directed to hold, subject to further proceedings or to termination of this writ, any property of the the judgment debtor in your possession 
at the time of service of this writ and all property of the judgment debtor that may come into your possession after service of this writ; including any 
debt owed to the judgment debtor, whether immediately payable or unmatured. Federal and state exemptions may be available to you and to the 
judgment debtor.  

With respect to a writ of garnishment of account in a financial institution, unless a Notice of Right to Garnish Federal Benefits that conforms 

with 31 C.F.R. §212.4 and Appendix B to 31 C.F.R. Part 212 is attached, financial institutions are directed: 1) not to hold property of the judgment 
debtor that constitutes a protected amount; 2) not to hold property of the judgment debtor that may come into the garnishee’s possession following 
service of the writ if the account contains a protected amount; and 3) to comply with other applicable requirements, prohibitions, and limitations of 
31 C.F.R. Part 212 (Md. Rule 3-645.1.)  

You must file an answer to the court within 30 days of service of this writ and forward a copy to both the plaintiff/creditor and the 

defendant/debtor. Failure to do so may result in a judgment by default being entered against you. The judgment debtor has the right to contest this 
garnishment by filing a motion asserting a defense or objection.

NOTICE TO GARNISHEE 

The garnishee shall file an answer within 30 days after service of the writ. The answer shall admit or deny that the garnishee 
is indebted to the judgment debtor or has possession of property of the judgment debtor and shall specify the amount and nature 
of any debt and describe any property. The garnishee may assert any defense that the garnishee may have to the garnishment, as 
well as any defense that the judgment debtor could assert. After answering, the garnishee may pay any garnished indebtedness 
into court and may deliver to the sheriff any garnished property, which shall be treated as if levied upon by the sheriff. A 
garnishee who has filed an answer admitting indebtedness to the judgment debtor or possession of property of the judgment 
debtor is not required to file an amended answer solely because of an increase in the garnishee’s indebtedness to the judgment 
debtor or the garnishee’s receipt of additional property of the debtor.  

With respect to a writ of garnishment of account in a financial institution, the answer of the institution shall state, if 

applicable, that a protected amount is in the judgment debtor’s account. The answer need not specify the amount. If the answer 
states that the property it holds consists only of a protected amount, the institution shall include with the Answer a request for a 
judgment in favor of the institution/garnishee terminating the garnishment (Md. Rule 3-645.1.)  

If the garnishee fails to file a timely answer, the judgment creditor may proceed for a judgment by default against the 

garnishee (Md. Rule 3-509.)  

If the garnishee files a timely answer, the matters set forth in the answer shall be treated as established for the purpose of the 
garnishment proceeding unless the judgment creditor files a reply contesting the answer within 30 days after its filing. If a timely 
reply is not filed, the court may enter the judgment upon request of the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor, or the garnishee. 
If a timely reply is filed to the answer of the garnishee, the matter shall proceed as if it were an original action between the 
judgment creditor as plaintiff and the garnishee as defendant and shall be governed by the rules applicable to civil actions. 

NOTICES TO JUDGMENT DEBTOR  
GENERAL  

As a result of the judgment entered against you, the bank or other person holding your money or property has been ordered by 
this court to hold your money or property that does not constitute a protected amount, subject to further order of the court. You 
have the right to contest this garnishment by filing a motion asserting a defense or objection. If there is no further filing 
within 120 days after the garnishee’s answer is filed, after proper notice to both you and the judgment creditor, the garnishee 
may file a notice of intent to terminate the writ of garnishment (Md. Rule 3-645.) 
 

CONCERNING EXEMPTIONS 
You may be entitled to claim an exemption of all or part of your money or property, but in order to do so you must file a 
motion with the court as soon as possible. If you do not file a motion within 30 days of when the garnishee was served, your 
property may be turned over to the judgment creditor. You may include in your motion a request for a hearing. If you file a 
motion under Md. Rule 3-643, claiming an exemption, and request a hearing, a hearing shall be held promptly.  

With respect to a Writ of Garnishment of account in a financial institution, some federal benefit payments may be 

automatically protected from garnishment and will not be held in response to the writ of garnishment. Any claim for exemption 
for a non-protected amount must be filed with the court no later than 30 days after service of the writ of garnishment on the 
garnishee (Md. Rule 3-645.1.)   

You have the right under the Annotated Code of Maryland to claim an exemption of certain kinds of personal property such 

as: wearing apparel, books, tools, instruments or appliances in an amount not to exceed $5,000 in value necessary for the 
practice of any trade or profession except those kept for sale, lease or barter; money payable in the event of sickness, accident, 
injury or death of any person including compensation for loss of future earnings (however, disability income benefits are not 
exempt if the judgment is for necessities contracted for after the disability is incurred); professionally prescribed health aids for 
the debtor or dependent of the debtor; debtor’s interest not to exceed $1,000 in value, in household furnishings, household 
goods, wearing apparel, appliances, books, animals kept as pets, and other items that are held primarily for the personal, family 
or household use of the debtor or any dependent of the debtor. IN ADDITION, WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF 
SERVICE OF THE WRIT OF GARNISHMENT ON THE BANK OR OTHER PERSON HOLDING YOUR MONEY OR 
PROPERTY, YOU MAY ELECT TO EXEMPT A TOTAL OF $6,000. (This exemption does not apply to an Attachment 
Before Judgment.)  

You may be entitled to claim an exemption under Maryland law of certain money such as Social Security disability benefits; 
Supplemental Security Income benefits; annuity payments based on retired or retainer pay from the Armed Forces; Civil Service 
retirement and disability funds; annuities to widows and surviving dependent children of judges; federal worker’s compensation; 
and federal retirement pensions.  

YOU MAY ALSO BE ENTITLED TO PROTECT OTHER MONEY OR PROPERTY NOT MENTIONED ABOVE.  

TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS FULLY, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ACT PROMPTLY. IF YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A LAWYER.
