Case No. 

Respondent 

CONSENT OF PARENT TO A PRIVATE AGENCY GUARDIANSHIP 
(FORM 9-102.1) 

CONSENT OF PARENT TO GUARDIANSHIP WITH THE RIGHT TO CONSENT TO 
,  
ADOPTION OF 

 
TO

A LICENSED PRIVATE ADOPTION AGENCY 

INSTRUCTIONS 

These instructions and attached consent form may be used only in cases where the child is being 

placed for adoption with the assistance of a licensed private adoption agency. Code, Family Law Article, 
Title 5, Subtitle 3a. 

The attached consent form is an important legal document. You must read all of these instructions 
BEFORE you sign the consent form. If you do not understand the instructions or the consent form, 
you should not sign it. If you are under 18 years old or if you have a disability that makes it difficult 
for you to understand, do not sign the consent form unless you have a lawyer. 

A. Right to Have This Information in A Language You Understand

You have the right to have these instructions and the consent form translated into a language that you 
understand. If you cannot read or understand English, you should not sign the consent form. You should 
have this form translated for you into a language you do understand. The translated consent form is the one 
you should read and decide whether or not to sign. Any translation must have an affidavit attached in which 
the translator states that it is a true and accurate translation of this document. 

B. Right to Speak With a Lawyer

You have the right to speak with a lawyer before you decide whether or not to consent. 

You should not sign the consent form without a lawyer if you are under 18 years old or have a disability that 
makes it difficult for you to understand this document. If you are under 18 years old or have a disability that 
makes it difficult for you to understand this document, you are required to have a lawyer review the form 
with you before you can consent to the guardianship. 

Even if you are not required to have a lawyer, you have the right to speak with a lawyer you choose before 
you decide whether to consent.  

You can ask the court to require the agency seeking guardianship of your child to pay the costs of the 
lawyer. The judge does not have to grant that request but may do so. 

CC-DR-099 (Rev. 01/2022)

C. Post-Adoption Agreement

If you have made a written agreement with the adoptive parents for future contact (known as a post-
adoption agreement), a copy of that agreement must be attached to the signed consent form. If you have a 
post-adoption agreement, and, after adoption, the adoptive parents do not do what they agreed to do, it will 
not affect your consent to the guardianship or the adoption. However, if that happens, you have the right to 
ask a judge to make them do what they agreed to do. The judge can order you and the adoptive parents to go 
to mediation, order the adoptive parents to do what they agreed to do, or change the agreement if the judge 
decides that it is in the child’s best interest. 

D. Conditional Consent

If you decide to sign the consent form, you will have two choices: 

(1) you can consent to the guardianship and the adoption of your child by a family approved by the adoption
agency; or

(2) you can consent to the guardianship only if the child is adopted into a specific family. This is called a
“conditional consent.” If you sign a conditional consent, and the family whose name is on the consent
cannot adopt the child, your consent will no longer be valid. The adoption agency will try to locate you to
find out if you want to sign a new consent. If your parental rights have not been taken away (guardianship
has not yet been granted), and you do not sign a new consent, the court will end the guardianship case. If
your parental rights have been taken away (guardianship has been granted), and you do not sign a new
consent, the court will decide whether it is in the child’s best interests to continue the guardianship.

E. Effect of Signing the Consent Form

IF YOU SIGN THE CONSENT FORM, AND GUARDIANSHIP IS GRANTED, YOU WILL BE 
GIVING UP ALL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES RELATING TO THE CHILD. 

If you have a post-adoption agreement, you will keep only the rights the agreement gives you. Violation of 
the agreement will not affect your consent or the adoption. 

F. Right to Revoke Consent

If you sign the consent form and then change your mind and no longer want to consent, you have the right 
to revoke (cancel) the consent within 30 days after the date that you sign the consent form. The only 
way that you can revoke this consent is by giving a signed written revocation statement with the name, 
sex, and date of birth of the child (if you know it) to: 

Adoption Clerk, Circuit Court for 

City/County 

at 

Address 

. 

The revocation must be sent to the court, not to the lawyers, or the agency, or the people adopting the child. 
You may deliver your written revocation of consent in person or by mail. If it is not received by the 
Adoption Clerk’s office within 30 days after the date you signed the consent form, it will be too late, and 
you will not be able to withdraw the consent or stop the guardianship from being granted. 

If you sign the consent form, and then revoke your consent, and then decide to consent to the guardianship 
again, you will not be able to revoke your second consent if you give your second consent in court within 
one year of your revocation of this consent.

G. Further Notice of Guardianship and Adoption Proceedings

hearings, if and when the guardianship is granted, and when the child is adopted. You also have the right to

Court’s Address

. Compensation 

nder Maryland law, you are not allowed to charge or receive money or compensation of any kind for the 
placement for adoption of your child or for your agreement to the adoptive parent having custody of your 
child, except for (1) reasonable and customary charges or fees for adoption counseling, hospital, legal, or 
medical services, (2) reasonable expenses for transportation for medical care associated with the pregnancy 
or birth of the child, (3) reasonable expenses for food, clothing, and shelter for a birth mother if, on written 
advice of a physician, the birth mother is unable to work or otherwise support herself because of medical 
reasons associated with the pregnancy or birth of the child, and (4) reasonable expenses associated with any 
required court appearance relating to the adoption, including transportation, food, and lodging expenses.

hen your child is at least 21 years old, your child, your child’s other parent, or you may apply to the 
Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health for access to certain birth and adoption records. If you do 
not want information about you to be disclosed (given) to that person, you have the right to prevent 
disclosure by filing a disclosure veto. Attached to this document is a copy of the form that you may use if 
you want to file a disclosure veto. 

. Adoption Search, Contact, and Reunion Services 

hen your child is at least 21 years old, your child, your child’s other parent or siblings, or you may apply 

to the Director of the Social Services Administration of the Maryland Department of Human Services for
