      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF THE 
PERSON AND / OR PROPERTY OF A MINOR (CC-GN-001) 
(Md. Rule 10-111) 

Before completing the Petition for Guardianship of Minor, review the General Instructions (form CC-DRIN) 
in addition to these instructions. These instructions will assist you and are for informational purposes only. 
They are not intended as legal advice. 
WHO SHOULD USE THIS FORM? 

Use the Petition for Guardianship of Minor (form CC-GN-001) if you are asking the court to appoint you or 
someone else as a guardian of the person or property of a minor (a child under 18), and you do not have a 
lawyer. These instructions answer questions including: 

WHAT IS GUARDIANSHIP?  
WHO CAN FILE FOR GUARDIANSHIP?  
HOW DO I FILE FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF A MINOR?  
WHO CAN BE A GUARDIAN?  
WHAT ARE THE GUARDIAN ORIENTATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

NOTE: Guardianship cases can be complicated. You may want to speak with a lawyer. 

WHAT IS GUARDIANSHIP OF THE PERSON OR PROPERTY OF A MINOR? 

Guardianship of the person: The court may appoint a guardian of the person of a minor if neither parent is 
capable of serving as guardian of the person or no testamentary appointment (i.e., appointment by will) has 
been made. If appointed, the guardian will make decisions about the minor’s health care, food, clothing, 
shelter, and other subjects. 

Guardianship of the property: A court will appoint a guardian of the property if it determines that: 

1. 

the minor owns or is entitled to property (e.g., through inheritance, tort recovery (money from a 
lawsuit for injuries or damages), insurance policy, etc.) that requires management or protection, 
or 

2. 

the minor needs funds for support, care, and education and protection is necessary or desirable to 
obtain or provide funds. 

If appointed, the guardian will determine whether the minor needs any distributions for the minor’s general 
well-being or for educational purposes, and petition the court for permission to withdraw funds. The 
guardian of the property may be required to post a bond.  

Guardianship of the person and property: A person can be appointed to serve as guardian of both the 
person and property of a minor. 

WHO CAN FILE FOR GUARDIANSHIP? 

Only interested persons can file for guardianship. Interested persons are defined by law. See paragraph 8 of 
the Petition for Guardianship of a Minor (form CC-GN-001) for a list of interested persons. 

If you are not an interested person, but are concerned about risks to the personal or financial well-being of 
the minor if a guardian is not appointed, it is recommended that you speak with a lawyer. 

C-GNIN-001 (Rev. 01/2021)

• Parent’s Consent to Guardianship of a Minor – If the minor’s parents are alive, ask them to 
consent (agree) to the guardianship by completing and signing the form Parent’s Consent to 
Guardianship of a Minor (form CC-GN-007). Include the original form with your petition. If you 
cannot get consent from a living parent because they cannot be contacted, located, or identified, 
file the Affidavit of Attempts to Contact, Locate, and Identify (form CC-GN-010) with the court. 
If there is another reason, file an affidavit with the court (a written statement made under oath) 
stating why you could not get the parent’s consent. 

• Designation of a Guardian of the Person – After a minor’s 14th birthday, the minor may 

designate who they want as a guardian of the person.  
Complete the Designation of a Guardian of the Person by a Minor (form CC-GN-008). 

• Designation of a Guardian of the Property – After a minor’s 16th birthday, the minor may 

designate who they want as a guardian of the property. Have the minor complete and sign the 
Designation of a Guardian of the Property by a Minor or Disabled Person (form CC-GN-009). 
Attach the original form to the petition. 

CC-GN-001 Form tips: 

• If you are a co-petitioner (another person joining the filing for guardianship of the minor), 

complete and sign a Co-Petitioner Information Sheet (form CC-GN-018). 

• Instruction 3: Similarly situated full siblings – means full siblings who need a guardian 

appointed for the same reason(s). 

• Paragraph 6: If you are asking the court to appoint another person as guardian of the person 
or property, ask that person to complete and sign the Prospective Guardian Information Sheet 
(form CC-GN-023) and file the original with your petition.  

• Paragraph 7: List the name of someone over the age of 18 who does not live with the minor 
and is not an interested person in the case. This is required so there is a neutral person the 
court can contact. 

☐ STEP 2. File for guardianship –  File the completed petition and required exhibits with the clerk of 
the court in the appropriate court. 

Where to File for Guardianship 
If you are requesting guardianship of the person and the minor lives in Maryland, file in the circuit 
court of the county (or Baltimore City) in which the minor is living. Do not file in the county (or 
Baltimore City) where you are living unless you live in the same county as the minor. If the minor 
does not live in Maryland, file in the circuit court of any county (or Baltimore City) in which the 
minor is physically present. 
If you are requesting guardianship of the property of the minor, file in any county (or Baltimore City) 
where the minor has property such as a house or bank account. 
If you are requesting both guardianship of the person and property, file in the county (or Baltimore 
City) in which the minor lives or is physically present. 

You may also be able to file your case in the orphans’ court in the county (or Baltimore City) where the 
minor lives, is physically present, or has property. Please note that a case that is filed in the orphans’ court 
will be transferred to the circuit court if it is contested. 
You must pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford the filing fees, ask the court to waive the fees at the beginning 
of your case by filing a Request for Waiver of Prepaid Costs (form CC-DC-089) (See General Instructions 
(form CC-DRIN) for more information on fees and court costs).

OW DO I FILE FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF A MINOR? 

If you are filing the guardianship case yourself, you are the petitioner. Use the CC-GN forms. 
There are six (6) steps: 

☐ STEP 1. Complete a Petition for Guardianship of Minor (form CC-GN-001). 

  H

The court will assign your petition a case number. It will also issue a show cause order that includes 

• the date of the guardianship hearing (see STEP 6); 
• the date by which service must be completed (see STEP 3); and  
• the date by which the minor and interested persons need to respond or “show cause” as to why a 

guardianship is not necessary or why a proposed guardian should not be appointed. 
 

Remember the case number. Keep copies of the petition and all attachments. 

 

☐ STEP 3. Service of process – Service of process is the way the court ensures that all necessary people 
receive copies of your guardianship petition. Your case cannot move forward until proper service is made. 

You must serve the minor, the parent(s), guardians(s), or other person(s) having care or custody of the 
minor, the minor’s attorney if they have one, AND all interested persons (see Paragraph 8 of form 
CC-GN-001 for a list of interested persons). If the minor lives with you, serve the minor and any additional 
persons named by the court. Service on a minor who is under the age of ten may be waived as long as the 
other service requirements are met (i.e., service is made upon the minor’s parent, guardian, or other person 
who has custody of the minor, or another person if the minor lives with the petitioner). 

Each person to be served must receive: 

1)  A copy of the petition; 
2)  Any papers filed with the court; and 
3)  The show cause order issued by the court. 

Serve interested persons with a Notice to Interested Persons (form CC-GN-005) if asking for a guardianship 
of the person and/or Notice to Interested Persons-Md. Rule 10-302(c) (form CC-GN-006) if asking for a 
guardianship of the property. 

☐ STEP 4. File proof of service with the court – File proof that all necessary people have been 
properly served with the required papers. If you were unable to contact, locate, or identify any interested 
person, complete and sign an Affidavit of Attempts to Contact, Locate, and Identify Interested Persons  
(form CC-GN-010) and file it with the court. 

or more information about service, see General Instructions (form CC-DRIN) and the Self-Help 

Video, “Service of Process,” available at: mdcourts.gov/video/selfhelp/serviceofprocess.html. 

 STEP 5. Appointment of an Attorney – After the court receives a petition for guardianship, it may 

appoint an attorney to represent the minor if the minor does not already have one. 

 STEP 6. Hearing  

The court will schedule a hearing to help the court decide if the minor needs a guardian and, if so, who 
should be appointed. It is important that you attend the hearing and bring all papers related to the case. If the 
minor or an interested person contests (challenges) your request for guardianship, contact a lawyer before the 
hearing.

Unless good cause is shown for the appointment, the court may not appoint someone as a guardian of the property 
who has been convicted of a crime that reflects negatively on that person’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to 
perform the guardianship duties, including fraud, extortion, embezzlement, forgery, perjury, and theft. 

If you or the proposed guardian has been convicted of a disqualifying crime, there will be an opportunity 
to explain to the court why the court should still make the appointment.

  W

HAT ARE THE GUARDIAN ORIENTATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS? 

efore the court appoints you as a guardian of the person or property, you must watch the orientation 

program for court-appointed guardians available at 
mdcourts.gov/family/guardianship/guardianorientationprogram. This brief video covers the role, duties, and 
responsibilities, of a guardian and what to expect if appointed. If you do not have access to a computer or 
need help watching the program, contact the court. 

fter watching the video, complete a Certificate of Completion – Guardian Orientation and Training 

Program (form CC-GN-031) and file it with the court. 

fter the court appoints you as guardian, it will direct you to complete a training program. The program 

covers your specific responsibilities as guardian in more detail, describes how to make decisions as a 
guardian, and provides information about community resources available to help you and the person you care 
for. Guardians of the person must complete the training within 120 days of appointment. Guardians of the 
property must complete the training within 60 days of appointment. The court may direct you to complete 
the training at another time. 

ome courts offer the training program as a class you can attend. Some may allow you to complete the 

training program online. Ask the court how you can meet the training requirement. 

isit mdcourts.gov/guardianship for more information about the court-appointed guardian orientation and 

training programs. This website also has checklists, court forms, and other resources for guardians.
