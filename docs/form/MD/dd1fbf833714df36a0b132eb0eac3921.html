BALTIMORE CITY CRIMINAL CITATION

This Citation constitutes prima facie evidence of the facts
contained if trial is waived or where the presence of the issuing
officer is not requested at trial. Failure to obey any requirement
of the Citation could result in the issuance of an arrest warrant
and increased fines and penalties.

NOTICE OF ADVICE OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL FOR ALL
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS

To the Person Charged:

1. This paper charges you with committing a crime.
2. If you have been arrested and remain in custody, you
    have the right to have a judicial officer decide whether
    you should be released from jail until your trial.
3. If you have been served with a citation or summons
    directing you to appear before a judicial officer for a
    preliminary inquiry at a date and time designated or within
    five days of service if no time is designated, a judicial officer
    will advise you of your rights, the charges against you, and
    penalties. The preliminary inquiry will be cancelled if a
    lawyer has entered an appearance to represent you.
4. You have the right to have a lawyer.
5. A lawyer can be helpful to you by:
       A. explaining the charges in this paper;
       B. telling you the possible penalties;
       C. explaining any potential collateral consequences of a
           conviction, including immigration consequences;
       D. helping you at trial;
       E. helping you protect your constitutional rights; and
       F. helping you to get a fair penalty if convicted.
6. Even if you plan to plead guilty, a lawyer can be helpful.
7. If you are eligible, the Public Defender or a court-appointed
    attorney will represent you at any initial appearance before
    a judicial officer and at any proceeding under Rule 4-216.2
    to review an order of a District Court commissioner
    regarding pretrial release. If you want a lawyer for any
    further proceeding, including trial, but do not have the
    money to hire one, the Public Defender may provide a
    lawyer for you. To apply for Public Defender representation,
    contact a District Court commissioner.
8. If you want a lawyer but you cannot get one and the Public
    Defender will not provide one for you, contact the court
    clerk as soon as possible.
9. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR TRIAL TO GET
    A LAWYER. If you do not have a lawyer before the
    trial date, you may have to go to trial without one.

Contact information for District Court Commissioner's Offices can be found at:
http://www.mdcourts.gov/district/directories/commissionermap.html
If you require further information about qualifying for a Public Defender,
call 1-833-453-9799.

NOTICE

A trial date notice will be sent to the address shown on the
Citation. If you reside at an address different from that shown, or
you change your address, you must immediately notify the Court
of the correct address.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
