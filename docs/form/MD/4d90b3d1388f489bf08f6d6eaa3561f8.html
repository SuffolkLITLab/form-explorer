      <pre>How 
Landlords 
Can Resolve 
Disputes 
with
Tenants

for Landlords      
Information 

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
DO I NEED A LAWYER?
In some instances, corporations and certain other 
business entities must be represented by an 
attorney. Otherwise, you are not required to have 
a lawyer, although one could be helpful to you.

WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?
When both sides appear: the court will hear 
both sides of a case and make a decision. If the 
landlord wins, the court will enter a judgment 
of possession, and if there was personal service 
on the tenant, the court may also issue a money 
judgment in the amount of rent and costs due.

When the landlord fails to appear: the court 
will most likely dismiss the case.

When the tenant fails to appear: the court will 
most likely enter a judgment in favor of the 
landlord.

WHAT SHOULD I BRING WITH ME TO 
COURT? You should bring all of your evidence, 
that is, whatever you have that you believe 
would support your claim or defense. 

HOW DO I REQUEST A POSTPONEMENT? 
You should make your request in writing prior to 
the court date, send a copy of your request to the 
opposing party, and certify that you have done so.  
However, you may also request a postponement in 
court on the trial date. 

HOW DOES THE EVICTION PROCESS 
WORK? In a Failure to Pay Rent case, if the 
tenant does not pay all rent and costs 
determined by the court to be due, the tenant may 
be evicted. If a landlord has obtained a judgment 
of possession, a request for a 
Warrant of Restitution must be filed within 60 
days of the judgment or the expiration 
of any stay of execution.

Generally, the tenant may prevent eviction by 
paying all rent and costs due at any time before 
the eviction. This is known as the tenant's right 
of redemption.

Exception: Foreclosure of the right of 
redemption: If there have been 3 prior 
judgments for possession (4 in Baltimore City) 
in the preceding 12 months, the court may 
foreclose (deny) the right of redemption. 

WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS TO A JURY 
TRIAL?
Jury trials are held in the circuit court, not 
the District Court. If the amount of the claim 
exceeds $25,000, or if the value of the tenant's 
interest in the leasehold is greater than 
$25,000, either party may request a jury trial. 
Jury trial requests must be in writing. In a 
residential tenancy, a request for a jury trial may 
be filed no later than the first appearance of the 
parties in District Court.  

HOW DO I COLLECT MONEY DAMAGES?
The court cannot collect money for you. It is 
your responsibility to collect damages awarded 
by the court. For more information, see District 
Court brochure titled Post-Judgment Collection 
(DC-CV-060BR).

NEED LEGAL HELP?
The Maryland Judiciary's Help Centers are 
staffed by trained attorneys and provide 
brief free legal advice on all civil matters, 
including questions regarding landlord/tenant 
proceedings. For more information, please 
call 410-260-1392 or visit mdcourts.gov/
helpcenter

HOW DO I FILE AN APPEAL? 
Each party has the right to appeal by filing 
an appeal on form DC-CV-037. In Failure to 
Pay Rent cases, the appeal must be filed no 
later than 4 business days after the date of 
judgment. In all other actions for possession, 
the appeal must be filed no later than 10 
calendar days after the date of judgment.  
Whether the appeal is de novo (a new trial) 
or on the record depends on the amount 
in controversy. The filing of an appeal does 
not automatically stop the eviction. Posting 
the bond ordered by the court will stop the 
eviction until the circuit court decides the 
appeal.    

MEDIATION: AN ALTERNATIVE 
The District Courtâ€™s Alternative Dispute Resolution 

Program (ADR) offers mediation free of charge.   

It is less formal, less time-consuming and less costly 

than going to court. A trained mediator will work 

with both sides to try to arrive at a mutually  

agreeable solution. If mediation is not successful, 

you may still seek a decision by the court.  

For more information on Maryland courts and 
procedures, please contact a clerk in any state or 
county courthouse or visit the Maryland Judiciary 
website:

mdcourts.gov

It is the mission of the District Court  

of Maryland to provide equal and exact  
justice for all who are involved in  
litigation before the court.

RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES OF
THE LANDLORD

GENERAL INFORMATION

Filing with the Court:
Please make sure that your paperwork is 
accurate and legible. All correspondence with 
the court after the initial filing should include 
the case number and a certification that you 
sent a copy to the tenant. The proper location 
for filing is in the county where the property is 
located. 

The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act:
In any action against a tenant, federal law 
requires you to provide, in the paperwork 
that you file, specific facts regarding whether 
each tenant is in the military. One source 
for obtaining this information is the Dept. of 
Defense Manpower Data Center: 
scra.dmdc.osd.mil/

For more information go to the Judiciary 
website at mdcourts.gov and follow the link 
to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act at 
mdcourts.gov/reference/scra

Service of Process: In all cases a summons 
must be delivered to (served on) the 
tenant(s).

Types of service are: 
1. Posting & Mailing - the sheriff or constable
posts the paper(s) in a conspicuous place,
usually the door of the rented property, and
a copy is mailed by first-class mail to the
tenant's address.

2. Personal Service - the sheriff or constable
personally delivers the paper(s) to the
tenant(s). Generally, posting is sufficient for
a judgment for possession of the property,
but personal service is required for a money
judgment. You can also arrange for personal
service in addition to the service by the sheriff.

Notes Regarding Eviction:
Eviction cannot take place on a Sunday or 
a holiday. The sheriff or constable must be 
present. The landlord is not responsible for 
notifying the tenant of the timing of the 
eviction, but doing so will give the tenant the 
opportunity to remove personal property.* 
The tenant is responsible for all property 
removed from the premises.
(*Exceptions may apply due to local laws)

ILLEGAL ENTRY, LOCKOUT, OR 
DIMINUTION OF SERVICES BY 
LANDLORD

1. When the landlord enters the rental
premises without legal authority, you can file:

(a) Complaint for Breach of the Covenant of
Quiet Enjoyment (on DC-CV-001, the District
Court Complaint form), or
(b) Petition for Peace Order (DC-PO-001,
DC-PO-001A, DC-PO-001S; see brochure
CC-DC-DV-PO-001BR for more details), or
(c) a criminal trespass charge.

2. When landlord unlawfully locks a tenant out
or otherwise unlawfully causes a diminution of
services to the tenant, tenant may be entitled
to be placed back in possession of the property,
or an award of actual monetary damages,
attorneys fees, and costs, depending on the
circumstances.

sooner than 4 business days from the date of 
judgment.

Yes. You must give the tenant written notice to 
quit. Generally, you must give notice:

week-to-week tenancy with a written lease
agreement, or 21 days prior to the expiration

excess of 1 week or a month-to-month tenancy;

Yes. You must give the 30 days written notice that

imminent danger of serious harm).

REFUSES TO LEAVE
What to file: Complaint for wrongful Detainer 
(DC-CV-089) or Grantor in Possession (DC-CV-109).

Do I have to do anything before filing?

Notes: Wrongful Detainer and Grantor in 
Possession actions are not landlord-tenant 
actions. The wrongful holder of the property is 
not a tenant. DO NOT file either if a specific 
landlord/tenant action exists.
