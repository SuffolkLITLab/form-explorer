regarding  this  section)  otherwise  entitled  under  the  State  law 
to  receive  regular  compensation,  as  if  such  State  law  had  been 
modified  in  a  manner  such  that  the  amount  of  regular  com-
pensation  (including  dependents’  allowances)  payable  for  any 
week shall be equal to— 

(A) the amount determined under the State law (before 

the application of this paragraph), plus 

(B)  an  additional  amount  of  $600  (in  this  section 
referred  to  as  ‘‘Federal  Pandemic  Unemployment  Com-
pensation’’). 
(2)  ALLOWABLE METHODS OF PAYMENT.—Any  Federal  Pan-
demic Unemployment Compensation provided for in accordance

(1)  IN GENERAL.—An  agreement  under  this  section  shall

the  number  of  weeks  (the  maximum  benefit  entitlement),  or 
the  average  weekly  benefit  amount,  of  regular  compensation 
which  will  be  payable  during  the  period  of  the  agreement 
(determined  disregarding  any  Federal  Pandemic  Unemploy-
ment  Compensation)  will  be  less  than  the  number  of  weeks, 
or  the  average  weekly  benefit  amount,  of  the  average  weekly 
benefit amount of regular compensation which would otherwise 
have  been  payable  during  such  period  under  the  State  law,

amounts  as  the  Secretary  estimates  the  State  will  be  enti-
tled  to  receive  under  this  section  for  each  calendar  month, 
reduced  or  increased,  as  the  case  may  be,  by  any  amount 
by  which  the  Secretary  finds  that  his  estimates  for  any 
prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts 
which  should  have  been  paid  to  the  State.  Such  estimates

Federal  unemployment  compensation  law  administered  by 
the  State  agency  or  under  any  other  State  or  Federal 
law  administered  by  the  State  agency  which  provides  for

method governing the computation of regular compensation 
under  the  State  law  of  that  State  has  been  modified  in 
a  manner  such  that  the  number  of  weeks  (the  maximum 
benefit entitlement), or the average weekly benefit amount, 
of  regular  compensation  which  will  be  payable  during  the 
period  of  the  agreement  will  be  less  than  the  number

necessary to demonstrate that the change— 

‘‘(i)  will  not  affect  the  safety  or  effectiveness  of 

the drug; and

tion  or  other  exposure  to  the  active  ingredient  in

more  administrative  orders  specifying  requirements  for 
determining  whether  a  minor  change  made  by  a  sponsor 
pursuant  to  this  subsection  will  affect  the  safety  or 
effectiveness  of  a  drug  or  materially  affect  the  extent  of 
absorption  or  other  exposure  to  an  active  ingredient  in 
the  drug  in  comparison  to  a  suitable  reference  product, 
together with guidance for applying those orders to specific 
dosage forms. 

‘‘(B)  STANDARD PRACTICES.—The  orders  and  guidance

(A) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 

(i)  There  is  an  urgent  need  for  personal  protective 
equipment  and  test  kits  to  the  Bureau  based  on  the 
density  of  the  inmate  population,  the  high  traffic,  the 
high  volume  of  inmates,  the  high  rate  of  turnover 
of  inmates  and  personnel,  and  the  number  of  high- 
security areas, within the facilities of the Bureau. 

(ii)  The  inability  of  the  Bureau  to  secure  the  pur-
chase  of  infectious  disease  personal  protective  equip-
ment  and  related  supplies  now  and  in  the  future  is 
a vulnerability. 

(iii)  The  Bureau  is  currently  competing  in  and 
engaging  the  same  landscape  of  vendors  as  all  other 
Federal agencies and private entities. 

(iv)  The  ability  of  the  Bureau  to  purchase  needed 
equipment and supplies is currently subject to an indi-
vidual  manufacturer’s  specific  recognition  of  the 
Bureau  as  a  priority  and  subsequent  allocation  of  the

priately consider, relative to other priorities of the Depart-
ment  of  Health  and  Human  Services  for  high-risk  and 
high-need populations, the distribution of infectious disease 
personal  protective  equipment  and  COVID–19  test  kits  to

America  Invents  Act  (35  U.S.C.  321  note),  or  regulations  promul-
gated thereunder, in effect during such period, if the Director deter-
mines that the emergency related to such period— 

(1)  materially  affects  the  functioning  of  the  Patent  and 

Trademark Office; 

(2)  prejudices  the  rights  of  applicants,  registrants,  patent 

owners, or others appearing before the Office; or

others  appearing  before  the  Office  from  filing  a  document  or 
fee with the Office. 
(b)  PUBLIC NOTICE.—If  the  Director  determines  that  tolling,

this subsection includes the duration of the portion of the emergency

COPYRIGHTS 

SEC.  19011.  (a)  AMENDMENT.—Chapter  7  of  title  17,  United 

States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: 

‘‘§ 710. Emergency relief authority 

‘‘(a)  EMERGENCY ACTION.—If,  on  or  before  December  31,  2021, 
the  Register  of  Copyrights  determines  that  a  national  emergency 
declared  by  the  President  under  the  National  Emergencies  Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) generally disrupts or suspends the ordinary 
functioning  of  the  copyright  system  under  this  title,  or  any  compo-
nent  thereof,  including  on  a  regional  basis,  the  Register  may,  on 
a temporary basis, toll, waive, adjust, or modify any timing provision 
(including  any  deadline  or  effective  period,  except  as  provided  in 
subsection  (c))  or  procedural  provision  contained  in  this  title  or 
chapters  II  or  III  of  title  37,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  for 
no longer than the Register reasonably determines to be appropriate 
to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the  disruption  caused  by  the  national 
emergency.  In  taking  such  action,  the  Register  shall  consider  the 
scope  and  severity  of  the  particular  national  emergency,  and  its 
specific  effect  with  respect  to  the  particular  provision,  and  shall 
tailor any remedy accordingly. 

‘‘(b)  NOTICE AND EFFECT.—Any  action  taken  by  the  Register 
in  response  to  a  national  emergency  pursuant  to  subsection  (a) 
shall  not  be  subject  to  section  701(e)  or  subchapter  II  of  chapter 
5  of  title  5,  United  States  Code,  and  chapter  7  of  title  5,  United 
States  Code.  The  provision  of  general  public  notice  detailing  the 
action  being  taken  by  the  Register  in  response  to  the  national 
emergency  under  subsection  (a)  is  sufficient  to  effectuate  such 
action.  The  Register  may  make  such  action  effective  both  prospec-
tively  and  retroactively  in  relation  to  a  particular  provision  as 
the  Register  determines  to  be  appropriate  based  on  the  timing, 
scope,  and  nature  of  the  public  emergency,  but  any  action  by  the 
Register  may  only  be  retroactive  with  respect  to  a  deadline  that 
has  not  already  passed  before  the  declaration  described  in  sub-
section (a). 

‘‘(c)  STATEMENT REQUIRED.—Except  as  provided  in  subsection 
(d),  not  later  than  20  days  after  taking  any  action  that  results 
in  a  provision  being  modified  for  a  cumulative  total  of  longer  than 
120  days,  the  Register  shall  submit  to  Congress  a  statement 

H. R. 748—302 

detailing  the  action  taken,  the  relevant  background,  and  rationale 
for the action. 

‘‘(d)  EXCEPTIONS.—The  authority  of  the  Register  to  act  under 
subsection  (a)  does  not  extend  provisions  under  this  title  requiring 
the  commencement  of  an  action  or  proceeding  in  Federal  court 
within a specified period of time, except that if the Register adjusts 
the  license  availability  date  defined  in  section  115(e)(15),  such 
adjustment  shall  not  affect  the  ability  to  commence  actions  for 
any  claim  of  infringement  of  exclusive  rights  provided  by  para-
graphs  (1)  and  (3)  of  section  106  against  a  digital  music  provider 
arising  from  the  unauthorized  reproduction  or  distribution  of  a 
musical  work  by  such  digital  music  provider  in  the  course  of 
engaging  in  covered  activities  that  accrued  after  January  1,  2018, 
provided  that  such  action  is  commenced  within  the  time  periods 
prescribed  under  section  115(d)(10)(C)(i)  or  115(d)(10)(C)(ii)  as  cal-
culated  from  the  adjusted  license  availability  date.  If  the  Register 
adjusts  the  license  availability  date,  the  Register  must  provide 
the  statement  to  Congress  under  subsection  (c)  at  the  same  time 
as the public notice of such adjustment with a detailed explanation 
of why such adjustment is needed. 

‘‘(e)  COPYRIGHT TERM EXCEPTION.—The  authority  of  the  Reg-
ister  to  act  under  subsection  (a)  does  not  extend  to  provisions 
under chapter 3, except section 304(c), or section 1401(a)(2). 

‘‘(f) OTHER LAWS.—Notwithstanding section 301 of the National 
Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1631),  the  authority  of  the  Register 
under  subsection  (a)  is  not  contingent  on  a  specification  made 
by  the  President  under  such  section  or  any  other  requirement 
under that Act (other than the emergency declaration under section 
201(a)  of  such  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1621(a))).  The  authority  described 
in  this  section  supersedes  the  authority  of  title  II  of  the  National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.).’’. 

(b)  TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—The  table  of 
sections  for  chapter  7  of  title  17,  United  States  Code,  is  amended
