      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND LAND INSTRUMENT INTAKE SHEET 1 INSTRUCTIONS. FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. LAND. INSTRUMENT. INTAKE. SHEET Purpose of the Intake Sheet . The purpose of the Intake Sheet is to provide a single form that the twenty four (24) circuit court . clerk offices will use to expedite the accurate . processing, recording, and indexing of land . instruments. Further, the Intake Sheet has been designed to accommodate the information needs . of the Maryland Department of Assessments a. nd Taxation (SDAT) and the local finance offices. NOTE: When a deed or other instrument ch. anging ownership is submitted to SDAT for . processing, a photocopy of the instrument . for SDAT, as well as the original, must . accompany the Intake Sheet. . Compliance . In accordance with Real Property Article . § 3 104 (g) , a completed Intake Sheet is required with . every land instrument submitted for recordation, . with the exception of releases and assignments . of mortgages and deeds of trust, substitutions of trustees, powers of attorney, and financing . . statements and their modifications. Section 1, S. ections 3 through 5, and Sections 7 through 10 of the Intake Sheet must be completed for all types . of instruments for which the Sheet is required. Sections 2, 6, and 11 also must be completed on Intake Sheets submitted with deeds. . Preparation Instructions . Please print or type legibly, in black ink only, all of the information that applies to your . instrument (s) in the spaces pr. ovided. When printing, press firmly. and always prepare all four copies of the Intake Sheet; the white, canary, and pink copies will be retained by the clerk™s . . office, SDAT, and the local finance offices respectively. After completing the form, the preparer . should retain the goldenrod copy for internal records and reference purposes. Only one Intake Sheet should be completed for each transaction . involving the same property. If there are more . than two instruments submitted for the same transaction, the . Addendum to Intake Sheet should be used to itemize information relevant to grantors/g. rantees such as considerations, recording fees, and taxes. If the preparer is submitting Intake Sheets or Addendums printed through the use of . . their own computers, a sufficient number of forms should be presented . with the instruments. . Section 1: Type (s) of Instruments. This Section is for use in identifying the type (s) . of instruments to be recorded and, if several . instruments are being recorded, in. indicating the sequence in which those instruments are to be . recorded. Therefore, if one instrument is being recorded, place . an X in the box next to the type of instrument to be recorded. If more than . one instrument is being recorded, number each . applicable box in the sequence in which the in. struments are to be recorded. Number each . instrument accordingly. . 2 For example, if you are submitting a deed and deed . of trust insert a ﬁ1ﬂ in the box next to ﬁDeedﬂ and a ﬁ2ﬂ in the box next to ﬁDeed of Trust. ﬂ NOTE: If the type of instrument to be submitted is not listed, enter it under ﬁOther. ﬂ . . NOTE: Use a separate intake sheet for each deed and complete as Type of Instrument ﬁ1. ﬂ . Section 2: Conveyance Type This Section should only be complete if the Inta. ke Sheet has been prepared to accompany a deed that should be processed by SDAT to transfer property ownership in the assessment records. The . primary purpose of this se. ction is to distinguish arms lengt. h conveyances from transfers that . have not had full exposure to the marketplace. An arms length sa. le is a transaction between unrelated parties under no duress. Please designate the type of conveyance by checking the appropriate box: Improved Sale Arms Length: Check this box if the property conveyed includes a building or other relatively permanent structure or development located on, or . attached to, land. Unimproved Sale Arms Length: Check this box if th. e property conveyed only consists of vacant land. . Multiple Accounts Arms Length. : Check this box if the property conveyed includes more than one account . for the assessment records. . Not an Arms Length Sale: Check this box if the transfer of the property was . between related parties, or one or more of the parties were acting under duress to buy or sell. Types of conveyances that are not considered an arms length . transfer of real property include a le. ase, gift, foreclosure, tax sale, or confirmatory deed. . Section 3: Tax Exemptions If applicable to the transaction, list each claimed exemption . for State recordation, State transfer, and county transfer taxes. The authority for each . exemption claimed should be cited or explained . briefly. Section 4: Consideration and Tax Calculations. This Section, together with Sections 3 and 5, is. intended to reduce the rejection of instruments . resulting from the incorrect calculat. ion of applicable charges. It is difficult for clerks to identify . 3 an error when verifying charges payable without knowing the amounts used by the preparer to . calculate taxes. . State the amount of the purchase price or cash consideration payable. If the transaction includes new secured debt, state the amount of the princi. pal debt secured by the new mortgage. If an . existing mortgage is being assumed, state the . balance due on the existing mortgage. If the . transaction involves other instruments (e. g. , a lease) . for which separate consideration is payable, or the transaction involves other consideration such as forgiveness of a debt owed by the grantee . to the grantor, state the amount of ﬁother consideration. ﬂ If the grantor is receiving property (real or personal) for the conveyance, state the full cash value of the real property conveyed. Section 5: Fees If more than one instrument . is being recorded, the informa. tion requested should be provided separately for each instrument. with the document number corres. ponding to the number assigned in Section 1. Itemize the recording charges, surc. harge, State transfer tax, State recordation tax and county transfer tax, if applicable. The ﬁOTHERﬂ category may be used to indicate . miscellaneous taxes that may be applicable to. the transaction. The amount indicated should be the net amount owed. . Section 6: Description of Property In connection with deeds. , this Section will be used to allow SDAT to transfer property in the . assessment records. For other inst. ruments, completion is optional. . Section 6 also will be used by the clerk offices . to index property identifiers in accordance with . Real Property Article § 3 104 (g) (3) (i) . Due to limited da. tabase fields, a maximum of 40 . characters can be allocated for property description information. Space permitting, therefore, the . property identifiers provided on the Intake Shee. t will be indexed in the following priority: 1) . Property Tax Identification Number: 2) Street Addr. ess; 3) Lot, Block, a. nd Section Numbers; 4) . Square Footage or Acreage; and 5) the abbreviation Var. L. O. G. . for ﬁVariable Lots of Ground. ﬂ Whenever the Intake Sheet is submitted with a deed, SDAT and, in some cases, the local finance . offices, will require completion of all property description information applicable to the . . transaction including, in addition to the above property identifiers, the district, subdivision name, . liber and folio of the deed by which the grantor acquired title, map number, parcel number, and . plat reference. Some of the information for . Section 6 may be obtained from the lien document . received in the local fi. nance/treasury office. The information also is available on public access . terminals at the counter in. local assessment offices. .
