INTRODUCTION

This guide is designed to help you understand the process of filing a small claim in the District 
Court of Maryland. Small claims are handled less formally than other cases. While you can hire an 
attorney if you choose, the rules of evidence and procedure in small claims cases are simplified to 
make it easier for individuals to represent themselves.

To be tried as a small claim in District Court, your case must meet the following conditions:

•  Your claim is for $5,000 or less; and,

•  Your claim is for money only, not the return of property or performance of a service; and,

•  You are not planning to request any discovery such as interrogatories (written questions that the 

other side must answer under oath in writing, before trial).

If you do not meet all three of these conditions, you do not have a small claim, and the information 
in this guide does not apply to your case.  

While  the  process  of  filing  a  small  claim  is  simple,  the  actions  required  at  each  step  will  vary 
depending on the situation. This guide will give you information about what process you need to 
follow and what decisions you need to make at each step.

If at any point your case seems more complex than what this guide covers, you may want to consider 
hiring an attorney to assist you. 

Step 1: Try to Resolve the Issue Out of Court

There are several reasons you should try to resolve your issue before going to court. First, it will 
likely save you time, emotional stress, and money. Second, your attempts to resolve the issue on 
your own may help you gather evidence that will help prove your case if you do need to go to court. 
To settle the case without going to a trial:

Talk With Your Opponent

The first thing you should always do is talk to the person with whom you have a dispute. Do this in 
person, if possible. To prepare for this conversation, think about how much money you feel you are 
owed. Then consider how much you are willing to compromise to settle the dispute without going 
to court. If you can reach an agreement, be sure to put it in writing. Both you and your opponent 
should sign the written agreement as soon as possible.

1

Write a letter

If talking with your opponent doesn't work, write a letter 
stating the reasons why the person or business owes you 
money  and  request  payment.  When  you  write  the  letter, 
begin by describing the problem. Clearly and politely state 
the resolution you want, and include a date by which you 
expect this to be done. Tell the person that if you are not 
paid, you plan to sue in small claims court. Keep a copy of 
the letter. 

Communicating with 
your opponent to 
resolve your issue out 
of court could save 
you time and money.

Mediation

The  District  Court’s Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  Program  may  be  helpful.  Mediation  is  less 
formal than going to court, and is more likely to result in a win-win solution, rather than one party 
winning and the other party losing. If you and your opponent attempt mediation, but cannot reach an 
agreement, you still have the right to proceed to court. For further information about mediation, ask 
for the brochure Mediation – Is Going to Trial Your Best Option? – Alternative Dispute Resolution. 
You can also call the Alternative Dispute Resolution Office at 410-260-1676 or 1-866-940-1729 
for further information.

Step 2: Consider Filing a Claim

If you decide you are not able to reach a satisfactory solution by talking with the individual, 
writing a demand letter, or through mediation, then you may wish to consider filing a claim. To 
decide whether to file your claim, consider the following questions:

Decision Point: Are you likely to win?

To win, you must file your claim within the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is an 
expiration date—if you don’t file your case within a certain amount of time, your claim is no longer 
valid. Most claims are valid for no more than three years.  You should try to resolve any debts as 
quickly as possible to avoid exceeding the statute of limitations.

You  also  have  to  be  able  to  prove  your  case.  In  court,  the  person  bringing  the  case,  known  as 
the  “plaintiff,”  has  “the  burden  of  proof.” Your  job  as  the  plaintiff  is  to  prove  your  case  by  a 
“preponderance  of  the  evidence,”  meaning  you  must  prove  that  you  are  most  likely  right.  The 
“defendant”—the person or business you are suing—doesn’t have to prove anything. The defendant 
just has to keep you from proving your case.

2

So, what do you need to prove your case? 

Evidence
You must present evidence, which is anything that helps you prove your case, such as testimony 
from a witness, a contract, a letter, an invoice, or an estimate. Whether your claim is business or 
personal, you should look at your case to make sure 
you have the necessary evidence to prove your claim 
before you file suit. 

Ask Yourself:

  •  Am I likely to win?

Exhibits

•  Is filing suit worth my time?

•  Can I collect if I win?

Exhibits will also help you prove your case. Exhibits 
are documents or other tangible items that tell the story 
of your case. Some exhibits are evidence, such as the 
items mentioned above—contracts, letters, invoices or 
estimates. Other exhibits are items that you have created; for example, an interest worksheet that 
explains how much interest the defendant owes you.

Ideally, you should have an exhibit that reflects each stage in your case. For example, in a contract 
case your exhibits should show:

•  what you were hired to do; 
• 
• 

how much the defendant agreed to pay; 

how much (if anything) the defendant did pay; 

• 

• 

how much is still owed to you plus interest; and 

your efforts to collect the balance before filing suit.

When you put together exhibits, imagine the judge leaving the courtroom with nothing but your 
exhibits in his hand. Your exhibits should tell the whole story. 

Note: When  assembling  your  complaint  for  filing,  do  not  send  your  originals  (checks,  letters, 
contracts, etc.) as exhibits. Copies are fine. In addition, make sure to save a full set of all exhibits 
in a separate file because you will probably want to use those same documents at trial. You will 
need additional copies of each exhibit presented during the trial, so you may want to make extra 
copies at this time. 

3

Decision Point: Is it worth your time to file a suit?

There are two major issues to consider before you answer this question. First, what is the most money 
(maximum recovery) you are likely to be awarded if you win? And second, if you win, how likely 
is it you will be able to collect the money from the defendant? The following may help you think 
through these important questions.

What is your maximum recovery?

Sometimes it may cost you more in time, effort, and money to go through a trial than you could recover 
if you win the case. To understand what your maximum recovery is, answer the following questions:

What are you owed? 

Can you recover interest?

The answer to this question is “the amount of the debt.” In the case of a debtor’s failure to render 
full payment when due, the amount owed is the balance the debtor should have paid. 

If you specifically informed the debtor in writing (e.g., on your invoices, estimate, or in a signed 
contract) that interest would be charged on all overdue balances, it is likely you can recover interest.

On the other hand, if you did not inform the debtor that they would be charged interest on overdue 
bills, chances are you will not be able to recover interest in your lawsuit.

Are you allowed to claim anything else, such as penalties, bounced check fees, or court costs?

In addition to recovering unpaid bills and interest, you may be entitled to:

•  Statutory Penalties—If someone pays you with a check that bounces, you are allowed to claim 
the amount the check was written for plus a bounced check fee. You may also file criminal 
charges—a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the amount of the check.

•  Court Costs—You will have to pay certain fees when you file your case. If you win your case, 

the judge could order the defendant(s) to reimburse you for your court costs. 

•  Attorney’s Fees—Reimbursement for attorney’s fees almost always depends entirely upon the 
wording of any billing arrangements you made with your debtor in advance. Attorney's fees 
must be incurred and determined by the court to be reasonable. If both parties did not agree in 
writing to pay attorney’s fees in the event of a dispute, it is not likely that you will be awarded 
attorney’s fees.  

4

You cannot recover:

•  The value of your time,

•  Your travel expenses going back and forth to court, or

•  Compensation for your inconvenience and aggravation.

Decision Point: Can you collect if you win?  

If the judge decides in your favor, you may not be able to collect the money you are owed. While 
some individuals and businesses will pay, others may have filed bankruptcy, may not have the money 
to pay you, or may be unwilling. If the defendant does not willingly pay the amount owed, you may 
want to pursue your other options. A clerk can explain these options to you.

Step 3: Filing a Small Claim

Basic Information

There are four basic steps in the small claims process:

a.  The plaintiff (the person seeking the money) files a Complaint form with the court.

b.  The plaintiff pays the filing fee. Check the District Court’s Civil Cost Schedule for fees.

c.  The court issues a Writ of Summons to officially notify the defendant that a suit has been 

filed.

d.  Proof is submitted to the court that the defendant has been notified, or served.

The court has standardized paperwork and procedures for dealing with each step. The forms are 
available at the clerk’s office at any District Court location. 

Completing the Complaint Form                                

The Complaint form is the most important document you will file in your case. The Complaint 
form tells the court:

•  That you are bringing the suit;

•  Who you are filing suit against;

•  Why you are filing suit; and,

•  How much money you are seeking.

The following explains each section of the Complaint form in detail. The three sections 
of the form are shown on the next page.

Attorneys

Section 1-Parties Involved 

Courthouse Address—Write in the address of 
the district courthouse where you intend to 
file your case. You should file your complaint 
in the county where the debtor lives, carries 
on regular business or is employed. 

Case  Number—Leave  this  box  blank.  The 
clerk will fill in the case number when you file 
your  Complaint  form  and  pay  the  filing  fee. 
Your case number will be displayed on all court 
notices. The case number is the court’s way of 
identifying your case. Once the court assigns a 
case number, it is extremely important that you 
place the number on all other documentation 
you send to the court.

Parties—The “parties to the lawsuit” are you 
(or your company) and the person, people, or 
companies  you  are  suing.  When  filling  out 
these spaces, it is important to use the correct 
full name and address of the parties. All court 
correspondence will be sent to the addresses 
you provide on the Complaint form, so make 
sure they are accurate. If you do not use the 
correct  names  and  addresses,  your  case 
could be delayed or dismissed.

Plaintiff—The  plaintiff  is  either  you  or 
your  company,  and  the  person  or  company      
identified  here  will  receive  the  judgment  if 
the  case  is  decided  in  your  favor.  Under  the 
agreement  you  had  with  the  defendant,  is 
the  money  due  to  you  personally  or  to  your 
company? 

• 

If the money is owed to you as an individual, be sure to use your full, correct name and your 
correct home address. 

7

• 

If the money is owed to your business, and you are not sure of the exact, formal name of your 
company, either ask your lawyer or accountant or check the full name shown on your company’s  
tax returns. Use your primary business address.

Defendant—The defendant is the person or business that owes you the money. You should fill in 
this space with the name and address of the defendant(s). 

Naming The Correct Defendant(s)       

Naming the right defendant is just as important as naming the plaintiff correctly. This is the person 
or people who will be served with the complaint and summons. Ask yourself, “Who is responsible 
for paying this bill?” 

Sometimes, the answer will be more than one person or company. For example, a customer bounces 
a check drawn on a joint account. In that case, name every person named as an account owner. You 
should name every person or company who would be legitimately responsible for the debt. 

Suing an Individual—If you name a person as a defendant, use their full name, complete with 
“Jr.,” “III,” or any other such suffixes. 

An individual must be at least 18 years old to be named as a defendant. If the debtor in your 
case does not meet this requirement, or is older than 18 but has a legal guardian, the defendant 
may in fact be the debtor’s parent or guardian or anyone else who gives care or has custody of 
the person or estate. 

Suing a Company—When you are suing a company, naming the defendant can be complicated. 
The defendant is not the company’s manager or even its president, but the company itself, unless 
someone personally guaranteed the debt for the company. 

For example, Barbara Jones may sign personally to guarantee payment for products bought by 
Barbara’s Cleaning Services, Inc. In this case, you would name both Barbara Jones and Barbara’s 
Cleaning Services, Inc. as defendants.

Always  put  the  full,  formal  business  name  on  the  Complaint  form,  such  as  “John  Debtor 
Enterprises, Inc.” or “Debtor and Son, Ltd.” Finding the correct name may be as easy as looking 
on a piece of stationery, a check the defendant may have given you, or the sign on the front of 
the defendant’s office. Be warned, however, that any of these places may display the trade name 
(“Don’s Clocks” for example) as opposed to the full, formal corporate name.

8

To find the full, formal name, check with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation 
(SDAT). SDAT's website can be located at: www.dat.state.md.us.

Resident Agent—If SDAT does have a listing of the company, it will also have a listing of the 
person or company authorized to accept service of suit papers, called the resident agent. State 
law requires corporations and/or limited liability companies (LLCs) to appoint a resident agent. 
A resident agent is the only person (or company) that can accept service of your court papers 
on behalf of a corporate defendant. 

The resident agent should not be listed as the defendant. Instead, list the name and address of 
the company responsible for the debt as the defendant. Next to or below the defendant’s name, 
write Serve on Resident Agent. You would then list the resident agent’s name and address. Please 
see the completed example on page 1111.  

If you can’t find a listing for a resident agent, serve your papers on an officer of the business, 
such as the president. Use the name and address of the business as you have it in your files when 
completing the paperwork.

Service of your Suit 

Next to the space reserved for each defendant’s name and address is a small box with the heading 
“Serve by:” Your choices are:

•  Certified Mail

•  Private Process

•  Constable

•  Sheriff

When  defendants  are  “served,”  they  are  notified  that  a  lawsuit  has  been  filed  against  them  and 
summoned to appear for trial by a Writ of Summons, which the court issues after you file your 
complaint. The Writ of Summons includes the case number and a trial date, time and location. One 
copy of the document must be delivered to the defendant, along with a copy of the Complaint form 
and supporting documents. 

There are several different ways to deliver these documents to the defendant, and the fees required 
vary for each. If your claim has several defendants, some who may be easy to serve and some who 
may be evasive, you are free to use any combination of these methods. 

9

Option 1: Certified Mail 

If you plan to notify the defendant by mail, you must use certified mail (also called “registered 
mail” or “return receipt requested”) to send the complaint, summons, and supporting documents. 
You may send it yourself, in which case the court will mail you a copy of the Writ of Summons, or 
the court will send it for the cost of the mail and a small 
service fee. It is important to use certified mail, because 
this is the only way you will have a “receipt” that the mail 
was delivered to the defendant. If the defendant does not 
accept and sign for the certified mail, service has not been 
made. The receipt must be submitted to the court as 
proof that the defendant was served.

You can serve the 
defendant by:
• Private Process
• Certified Mail
• Sheriff or Constable

Save copies of all documents sent by mail, as well as the 
postal receipts from certified letters and packages.

Option 2: Private Process Server

A “private process server” is a person who hand delivers court documents (such as complaints, 
summonses, and subpoenas) to people. If you choose to serve the defendant by private process, the 
court will mail you a copy of the Writ of Summons.

Any person, 18 years or older, who is not party to the lawsuit may serve the defendant. This individual 
will sign a document (called the “Affidavit of Service”) stating that the complaint, summons, and 
supporting documents were served on the defendant. The Af﻿fidavit of Service is the proof you need 
to send to the court that a private process server has served the defendant.

There are many companies in the business of serving defendants in civil claims. You can find such 
companies by looking in the business yellow pages or even by calling a local law firm and asking 
for a reference. You should always ask about the rates before you hire. You may also use a family 
member or friend, as long as they are not a party to the lawsuit, to privately serve the defendant 
with the papers.

Options 3 & 4: Sheriff or Constable

One of the county sheriff’s or constable’s responsibilities is serving defendants in civil cases. Check 
the Civil Cost schedule for sheriff or constable service costs. 

10

The  Court  will  deliver  the  Writ  of  Summons, 
Complaint  form  and  supporting  documents  to  the 
sheriff or constable for service on the defendant. After 
serving the papers, the sheriff or constable returns a 
second copy of the Writ of Summons to the court, 
certifying that the defendant has been served.

Contract cases involve non-payment for money owed 
to you under a contract. Tort cases involve a harm that 
has been done to you and that has resulted in monetary damages, such as someone damaging your 
car. Replevin cases seek the return of property, along with possible damages, allow for the possible 
return/possession of the property at a Show Cause hearing (a hearing held before a trial), and are 
filed in District Court regardless of the amount in dispute. Detinue cases seek the return of property 
or its value, along with possible damages; require a trial to determine rightful owner of property; 
the amount of the claim determines jurisdiction - District Court for claims of $5,000 or less (small 
claims); either District or circuit court for claims between $5,000 and $30,000; circuit court for 
claims more than $30,000. Bad Faith Insurance Claims seek, in addition to actual damages, the 
expenses, litigation costs and interest from a first party insurance claim that was not processed in 
good faith. (Applies to actions under Code of Maryland, Courts and Judicial Proceedings § 3-1701.)

The Particulars of Your Case—In this section, briefly explain to the judge why you are entitled to 
the money you are claiming. Keep the information short and simple.

ample Interest Worksheet

  S

In the first blank, you should enter the amount you are claiming. In the interest blank, you would 
enter any interest. You will also need to indicate on the Complaint form whether you are claiming 
“attorney’s fees” as part of your case. If you are acting as your own attorney, you are not permitted 
to make a claim for attorney’s fees. If you are representing yourself, you would leave this space 
blank or fill in $0.00.

Interest Worksheet 

If your contract entitles you to collect interest on overdue balances, prepare an interest worksheet. 
You may find it helpful to use the format shown above. This worksheet should be attached to your 
Complaint form as an exhibit and should show the calculations you used to determine the amount 
of interest you are claiming. Your worksheet must contain the following information:

•  The interest rate;  

•  The amount of money on which interest is being assessed; 

•  The length of time over which the interest has been assessed; and

•  The rate at which interest continues to accrue.

12

Note  that  you  should  show  the  interest 
accruing  from  the  date  on  which  the  debt 
became due through the date on which you 
file your complaint.
Because  the  judge  will  not  be  reviewing 
the  case  until  after  the  complaint  is  filed, 
your  worksheet  should  indicate  the  rate  at 
which interest is accruing. The easiest way 
to  express  this  is  to  state  at  the  bottom  of 
the worksheet that interest will continue to 
accrue at the rate of $_.__ per day. 
Signature—The court will not accept your 
Complaint  form  without  your  signature  in 
this area. If you are filing suit individually, 
sign  your  name  on  the  line  and  cross 
out  everything  below  the  line  except  the 
words  “Signature  of  Plaintiff.”  If  your 
company is the plaintiff, sign your name and 
indicate your position or title. You have now 
completed section 2 of the Complaint form 
(see sample at right). 

Section 3—Military Service Af﻿fidavit

To be entitled to an affidavit judgment or to 
a default judgment, Federal law requires a 
plaintiff to file an affidavit as to whether any 
defendant is in the military service. The most 
commonly  accepted  documentation  is  the 
form  available  at:  scra.dmdc.osd.mil.  This 
website search requires the Social Security 
Number of the defendant. Section 3 of the 
District Court Complaint Form (DC-CV-001) 
is a Military Service Affidavit to assist plaintiff in complying. If a judge finds that the affidavit lacks 
sufficient facts to determine whether any defendant is in the military service, the court may deny 
affidavit judgment and schedule a hearing. Federal law gives the court several options if the court 
finds that the defendant is in the military service. The court may require the plaintiff to post a bond, 
the court may appoint counsel to represent the defendant, or the court may stay the proceedings. 
Information about the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the required affidavit can be found on 
the courts website at: mdcourts.gov/reference/scra.html. Filing a false Military Service Affidavit is 
a criminal offense punishable by not more than one year incarceration and a fine not to exceed one 
thousand dollars.

13

Section 4—Application and Af﻿fidavit in Support of Judgment
You are not required to complete this section. If you have documents that support your case, you 
should complete this application. It does not take any extra time or money, and it could save you an 
enormous amount of time and effort. 

After the defendant is served, they have 15 days to file a "Notice of Intention to Defend" with the 
court. Defendants who are served outside of the state and those required by law to have a resident 
agent and who are served by service upon the State Department of Assessments and Taxation or 
another State agency have 60 days to file. This notice lets the court know that the defendant will 
contest your claim. The court will notify you if an Intention to Defend is filed. 

If the defendant does not file a Notice of Intention to Defend and you have completed this section 
of the Complaint form, the judge will review your Complaint form and supporting documents.
If the judge believes that your documents prove your case, the judge can rule in your favor, without 
a trial. This type of judgment is called an “Affidavit Judgment.”

Completing this section of the form does not guarantee that the judge will grant you an affidavit 
judgment. The judge might require you to appear in court at a later date to present further evidence.

However, you are not eligible for af﻿fidavit judgment if you do not complete this section. Indicate 
on the form which type of documents you have to support your case. You must sign and date the 
bottom of this section.

You have now completed Section 4 of your Complaint form (see sample below). It’s time to submit 
your Complaint form, with supporting documents attached, to the Clerk’s Office in the District Court 
for the county in which you are filing suit.

You will have to make several copies of the complaint and  exhibits—one copy for the court and 
one set for each defendant. You will also keep a copy for yourself, of course.

(See Plaintiff Notice on Back Page)

14

The Filing Fees

Once you complete the Complaint form and attach your exhibits, file them with the court and pay 
the required fees. In addition to the cost of filing the case, there is also a fee if you want the court to 
have the defendant served (either by mail or by constable/sheriff). Check the current District Court 
Cost Schedule when you pick up your court forms. 

Notifying the Defendant

After you file your complaint, the court issues the Writ of Summons for service on the defendant. 
The bottom half of the writ includes the “Notice of Intention to Defend.” Defendants have 15 
days from the date that they receive the summons to file this notice with the court. Exception: 
defendants who are served outside of the state and those required by law to have a resident agent 
and who are served by service upon the State Department of Assessments and Taxation or another 
State agency have 60 days to file the notice. By filing the notice, the defendant is letting the court 
know that they plan to argue that you are not entitled to the damages you are claiming. 

Renewing a Summons

The number of days that a summons is valid will be printed on the form. If the summons is not 
successfully served on the defendant within that time period and you wish to try to serve the defendant 
again, the summons must be renewed.

To renew a summons, complete a “Request for Summons/Summons Renewal” Form, checking the 
space marked “renewal.” Check the Cost Schedule and send the renewal fee to the court with the 
completed renewal request.

Submitting Proof of Service (proof that the defendant has been notified)

Once the defendant has been served, the court must receive 
Proof of Service. If the court does not receive Proof of Service 
within the time allotted for the defendant to file an Intention to 
Defend, you may not be able to present your case on the trial 
date. 

As noted above, there are various ways to notify the court that  
the defendants have been served. Once this proof is received on 
each of the defendants named, the court will schedule a hearing. 
A summary of the type of proof needed for each method of 
serving a defendant follows: 

Keep a copy of  
all of your
correspondence  
with
the Court and 

the defendant.

15

If the court serves the complaint and summons by certified mail, you will be notified only if it was 
not delivered. You may then decide whether to attempt another method of serving the defendant.

f you sent the complaint and summons by certified mail yourself, you must return the receipt of 
delivery to the court. Mail the completed form back to the court along with a cover letter confirming 
that you are enclosing proof of service for filing in this case. 

Certified Mail

  I

Private Process Server

The private process server must complete and sign a document, called the “Affidavit of Service”, 
stating that the papers were served on the defendant and send it to the court. With each return 
of service, the private process server must provide their printed name, mailing address, and 
telephone number. The service may be considered unacceptable if not legible. Make sure that 
your private process server understands their obligation to notify the court that your summons has 
been served on each defendant.

Sheriff or Constable

If you decided to have the defendant served by a sheriff or constable you will receive notification 
that the defendant has been served. If the sheriff or constable was unable to serve the defendant after 
several attempts, you can get the summons back from the court to try to serve it some other way. 
You may need to renew the summons at this point if it has expired.

Step 4: Handling the Defendant's Response

Now that the defendants have been served with your complaint and summons, they will react in 
one of the following ways:

•  Attempt to negotiate a settlement;

•  File an Intention to Defend and argue their side of the case in court;

• 

Ignore the complaint entirely, thus allowing you to win by default;

•  Claim they were not properly notified; and/or

•  File (or threaten to file) a countersuit against you or your company.

Here is what you may want to consider in deciding your next move:

What if the Defendant Attempts to Negotiate a Settlement?

Even if you were unsuccessful in your initial attempts to negotiate a settlement, you should listen 
to what your opponent may offer at this point.

16

Now that the defendant realizes you have a good case and are serious about going to trial, 
you may be in a better position to reach a reasonable resolution without going to trial. Review 
the information in the Introduction under Step 1- Try to Resolve the Issue Out of Court. Your 
opponent may also be willing to consider mediation at this point.  

What if the Defendant Files a Notice of Intention to Defend?

If the defendant files a Notice of Intention to Defend, the court will notify you. The Notice of 
Intention to Defend includes space for the defendant to explain why they should not be required 
to pay you the money you claim you are owed. If the defendant chooses to list a reason, the notice 
you receive from the court will include that reason. Take note of the defendant’s claim. You need 
to be prepared to explain to the judge why the defendant’s argument is not valid. Make sure you 
bring your exhibits and evidence.  

What if the Defendant Ignores the Complaint and Summons?

If you requested Affidavit Judgment, and the defendant fails to respond to your complaint, you 
might receive your judgment without having to appear for trial. The court will simply send you a 
notice confirming the date on which the judgment was entered, the amount of the judgment, and 
any additional amounts found to be due from the defendant such as court costs or interest.  

However, the judge may find that you have not presented enough proof of your version of the 
case. If the judge declines to sign the order entering the judgment, you will be notified of a new 
trial date on which to appear and present your evidence. If the defendant does not appear on the 
new trial date, Federal law requires a plaintiff to provide information as to whether any defendant 
is in the military. For more in-depth information, see page 13 of this brochure.

What if the Defendant Claims the Notification Was Not Received?

Defendants may claim they were not properly served with your complaint and summons in one of 
two ways: (1) by filing a pre-trial request that the case be dismissed for improper service; or (2) by 
making the argument at the trial. In either case, if the trial is postponed, then you may have to have 
the defendant re-served with a new summons.

What if the Defendant Files a Counterclaim?

Sometimes defendants respond to a lawsuit by filing one of their own. If filed in the same action, 
what would otherwise be called the defendant’s complaint is called a “counterclaim.” 

17

A counterclaim is basically the defendant’s way of saying “I don’t owe you money. You owe me 
money.” You  must  always  be  prepared  to  answer  the  defendant’s  counterclaim.  Consider  any 
additional evidence you may need in order to disprove the counterclaim, and prove to the judge 
that your claim is right.

Do You Need a Lawyer?

Although you are not required to use a lawyer for a small claim, you may still want to get one. An 
analogy would be that even if you read a book on how to build an addition on your house, you may 
still want to hire a builder. With a project so big,  the consequences of failure are too great. Most 
people would call in an expert for such a big job, but might try a smaller building project themselves.

So  it  is  with  the  law.  In  making  the  decision  about  whether  you  need  a  lawyer,  you  will  need 
to consider how skilled you feel at explaining your side of the story to the judge; how well you 
understand the laws that apply to your situation; how much time you have to do the paperwork and 
research required; and the cost to you if you do not win.

If the defendant files a counterclaim seeking a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars, you 
may still be well-advised to represent yourself without an attorney, especially if hiring an attorney 
would cost more than the claim is worth. As the numbers increase, however, so does your risk. If 
the worst happens, and the judge finds against you on your complaint and awards the defendant 
every penny of his claim, could you afford the loss easily? If so, you could chalk it up to a learning 
experience and move on. If not, and a loss could devastate or even destroy your personal assets or 
your business, seek the assistance of an attorney.

Next Steps

Once you have filed your small claim, and you are waiting for your trial date, it is time to begin 
preparing for your day in court. This will involve preparing an opening and closing statement, 
selecting and preparing witnesses, and organizing your exhibits 
and presentation.

Please feel free to contact a District Court clerk if you have any 
questions about the next steps, or any information in this booklet. 
We hope you will find this information helpful.
