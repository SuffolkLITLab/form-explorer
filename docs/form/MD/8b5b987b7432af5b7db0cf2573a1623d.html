Happens 

When You 

Are Arrested 

for a Crime?

Criminal Defendant

Do I Need a Lawyer?
You are not required to have a lawyer. However, 
a lawyer will give you legal advice, help defend 
you, explain any potential collateral conse-
quences of a conviction, including immigration 
consequences, and protect your interests before 
the court. 

How Do I Get a Lawyer?
If you wish to hire a lawyer but do not know one, 
or if you wish to defend yourself but want to 
consult with a lawyer, the Lawyer Referral 
Service of the local Bar Association can help. 
Check the Yellow Pages under Lawyer Referral 
Service.

If the offense is one that is punishable by 
imprisonment and you want to hire a lawyer 
but cannot afford one, the State may supply 
you with a lawyer free of charge, if you meet 
eligibility requirements. Contact a District Court 
commissioner at least two (2) weeks before your 
trial date.  

If you do not meet eligibility requirements for 
a Public Defender, many organizations and law 
firms provide free or low cost legal services. 
Contact the Maryland State Bar Association or 
a local bar association for assistance.

When Should I Contact a Lawyer?
Immediately. Your lawyer will need time to 
prepare your case for trial. If you have not hired 
your own lawyer or contacted the Public 
Defender by the time of your trial, the judge 
can make you go to trial without a lawyer.  

The Public Defender may refuse your 
case if you apply with less than 10 working 
days before trial. 

It is your responsibility to obtain legal counsel.

See section, "What Happens After I Am Arrested" 

Contact information for District Court Commissioner's 
Offices can be found at: 
mdcourts.gov/district/directories/commissionermap 
If you require further information about qualifying for a  
Public Defender, call 1-833-453-9799.

DC-CR-002BR (Rev. 12/2022)

What Is Bail?
Bail is money paid to the court to ensure that 
an arrested person who is released from jail will 
show up at all required court appearances. 

Who Can Post Bail For Me?
You may post bail for yourself, have someone 
over 18 years old post it on your behalf, or use 
a bondsperson. Whoever posts bail for you 
assumes full responsibility for your appearance 
in court. If you fail to appear as required, a 
warrant will be issued for your immediate 
arrest and the bail will be forfeited.

How Can I Post Bail?
Bail may be posted in the following manner:

1. Cash Bail
“Cash bond” may be posted by the defendant,
an individual, or by a private surety. Failure to
pay support may be posted by the defendant
only. If you appear for trial or the charges are
disposed of before trial, the amount posted
will be refunded. If you do not appear, the
bail becomes due and any cash posted will be
forfeited.

2. Property Bail
Property (e.g. land or home) in Maryland may
be used to post bail, provided that the net
equity in the property meets or exceeds the
amount of bail. To determine net equity, deduct
any liens, mortgages or deeds of trust, and
ground rent, capitalized at 6 percent, from the
assessed value of the property.

When posting property, you need to present 
tax bills, assessment notices, copies of a 
recorded deed or other public records. Each 
person whose name appears on the tax bill 
must sign the form, unless a power of attorney 
has been executed by one or both parties 
authorizing another signature. 

3. Intangible Assets
Acceptable intangible assets include:
a. Bankbooks and certificates of deposit
accepted at 100 percent of stated value 
b. Letters of credit from a bank
c. Certificates for stocks listed on the
American or New York Stock Exchange,
accepted at 75 percent of the present
exchange quotation.

Only a clerk of the court may accept 
intangible assets; a commissioner may not. 
Present the required documents to a clerk at 
the court location where the case is pending.

4. Credit and Debit Cards
Bail may be charged on certain credit and
debit cards. Although a commissioner or
clerk accepts the card, an independent
company processes the charge. The charge
includes the amount of the bail and a service
fee. (These charges will appear on your next
credit or debit card statement.) The card
and personal identification must be
produced in person at the time of posting
bail. (Contact a District Court commissioner
or clerk for information on cards accepted
and the fees charged.)

5. Professional Bail Bondsperson
A bail bondsperson charges a nonrefundable
fee to post bail. In addition to the fee, the
bondsperson may require collateral security
or property to secure your release. Collateral
will be returned to the person who posted it
after disposition of the charges. The service
fee and collateral received must be displayed
on the bail bond form. Make certain that the
information is correct on the form, that you
receive a receipt and that you understand the
action the bondsperson may take if you fail to
meet your obligations.

For the telephone number of a bondsperson 
consult the Yellow Pages under “Bail Bonds.”

Do I continue to pay fines during 
appeal?
You must continue to make scheduled 
payments of court ordered fines and costs 
unless the judge ordered that payment be 
stayed or that the full amount be paid as a 
condition to forwarding the appeal. Requests 
for stay of payment must be made in writing 
at the same time that you file your appeal.

m I still on probation during my 

appeal?
You must fulfill the terms and conditions of
your probation, unless the judge has ordered 
a stay of probation. Requests for stay of 
probation must be made in writing at the 
same time that you file your appeal.

. A

Will I be released during appeal? 
Your release depends upon the factual 
circumstances of the case and the ruling of
the judge. The District Court conforms with 
the guidelines established by the Supreme 
Court of Maryland to determine your 
confinement or release pending appeal.

Must I post new bail while my appeal is 
pending? 
Original bail, if any, continues through an 
appeal unless discharged by the judge. If the 
judge sets an appeal bail greater than the 
original bail, you must post an additional bail 
to cover the increase.

Do I need a transcript for an appeal? 
A transcript of the trial is not required in 
criminal or traffic appeals. If you would like to 
have a recording of your District Court trial, 
you may have one upon payment of the cost.

What Happens After I Am Arrested?

You will be taken before a District 

Court commissioner. The commissioner 
will determine if there is probable cause to 
charge you. If there is not probable cause, 
you will be released, but the charges will 
remain. If there is probable cause to charge 
you, the commissioner will determine 
whether you are released and the terms of 
the release.

If the commissioner determines 

that there is probable cause to charge you, 
you have a right to be represented by an 
attorney before a pretrial release decision 
is made. If you wish to have an attorney, 
you may contact your own attorney. If your 
attorney cannot be present in person, the 
attorney may participate by telephone or 
other electronic means. If your attorney 
is not able to participate, you will be 
temporarily held until your attorney is 
available. 

If you do not have an attorney 
because you are unable to pay an attorney, 
you may be entitled to free or reduced-fee 
representation. The representation will be 
free before the commissioner and, if you are 
not released by the commissioner, before 
the judge who reviews the commissioner’s 
pretrial release determination. The free 
representation is PROVISIONAL and limited 
to helping you during the commissioner’s 
pretrial release determination and the 
court’s review of that determination. YOU 
WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME FREE ATTORNEY 
FOR THE TWO PROCEEDINGS UNLESS YOU 
MAKE SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
ATTORNEY.  

After the decision to release or 

hold you has been made, you will need to 
arrange for representation for the remainder 
of the case. Of course, a private attorney 
can represent you. If you cannot afford a 
private attorney, you may be entitled to 
representation by the Public Defender. To 
apply for Public Defender representation, 
contact a District Court commissioner. 
If you are detained, you will be 

allowed to meet with the Public Defender 
at the detention facility. If you are 
released, you will have to contact the 
Public Defender’s office and follow their 
instructions. 

What Happens If I Receive a 
Citation or Summons Directing 
Me To Appear For a Preliminary 
Inquiry?
You should appear for the preliminary inquiry 
at the date and time designated or within 
five (5) business days of receipt if a time is 
not given. The hearing will be cancelled if an 
attorney enters an appearance to represent 
you.
What Is a Preliminary Inquiry?
A preliminary inquiry is a pretrial proceeding 
conducted by a judicial officer when you have 
been charged with a jailable (must appear) 
offense by citation or summons. You will be 
advised of your rights, the charges against 
you, and the penalties.
What Court Will Hear My Case?
The District Court hears most cases 
involving motor vehicle violations, criminal 
misdemeanors and certain felonies. The circuit 
court hears cases involving serious felony 
crimes.
Will I Be Tried by a Jury?
A judge hears District Court cases and many 
circuit court cases; however, you may request 
a jury trial if you face a charge punishable 
by imprisonment for more than 90 days. A 
written request for a jury trial should be filed 
fifteen (15) days before the scheduled trial 
date; however, the request may be made at 
any time before the trial actually starts.  

If your case is set for trial in the circuit court, 
you will be asked whether you want a jury 
trial when you are arraigned in the court.
What Is a Preliminary Hearing?
A preliminary hearing is a proceeding held 
in the District Court to determine if probable 
cause exists to charge you with a crime. You 
are not allowed to testify or to offer evidence 
at the hearing, but you have the right to 
hear the evidence against you and to cross 
examine the state’s witness. If the court 
finds no probable cause, charges may be 
dismissed. (However, the State’s Attorney 
may refile charges later.)

If you are charged with a felony or crime which 
must be tried in circuit court and you have not 
been indicted by the grand jury, you have a right 
to a preliminary hearing. You must request one 
within ten (10) days of your first appearance 
before the commissioner. If you waive your 
preliminary hearing, or if it is held and the court 
finds there is sufficient probable cause, the 
State’s Attorney must file within thirty (30) days 
a charging document in the circuit court, enter a 
nol pros (unwilling to proceed) or stet (a stay of 
proceedings) in the District Court, or amend the 
charges so that they can be tried in the District 
Court.
Will I Have a Record?
Records will exist on all charges filed against you 
and the disposition of those charges, including 
any convictions.

Even if you are not convicted, court records will 
exist on the charges filed against you and the 
result of the case. Additionally, police agencies, 
the State’s Attorney, or the Public Defender may 
maintain records of your arrest and/or trial.

Under certain conditions you can have all records 
pertaining to your case made unavailable to the 
public through a process called expungement.

If your case is expunged, no public or private 
agency or individual can use the records of your 
arrest and/or trial against you. 

For more information regarding expungements, 
please see Expungement Brochure  
(CC-DC-CR-072BR). 
Can I Appeal a Verdict ?
You have a right to appeal a guilty verdict  
entered in a District Court criminal or traffic 
case. You do not have a right to appeal if you 
have been given a Probation Before Judgment.

How and when should I plan an appeal?
Complete the Order for Appeal and file in the 
District Court within 30 days of disposition. Pay 
circuit court costs. If you cannot pay, speak with 
a clerk about the procedures to have the fee 
waived. The District Court has no power to grant an 
extension of time for filing an Order of Appeal.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
