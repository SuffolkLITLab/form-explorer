      <pre>How to File 
a Claim 
for the 
Return of 
Your Property

Replevins and Detinues

The Defendant’s Response

Once served, a defendant may respond to your lawsuit by: 

•   attempting to negotiate a settlement, 
•   ignoring the complaint,
•   filing a counterclaim against you, 
•   trying to get the case dismissed, and
•   defending the case at the hearing and trial.

You have the option to negotiate a settlement before going to trial [see Mediation: an 
Alternative" on the right]. Be prepared at trial to provide evidence to support your claim 
and evidence to disprove any counter argument.

What Happens at the Hearing?

If you filed a replevin, the defendant will be served with the Show Cause Order and 
the complaint. A hearing will generally be scheduled within three weeks of the date that 
the order was issued. At the hearing, the judge will listen to both sides and decide what 
to do temporarily with the property prior to trial. If the Show Cause Order is granted, 
the plaintiff may be required to post bond in the amount of the value of goods being 
sought. A trial date will be set. 

If you filed a detinue, no hearing will be held. You and the defendant will be notified 

of the trial date.

What Happens at the Trial?

Whether you filed a replevin or a detinue, at the trial you must be prepared to present your 

case; have any witnesses ready and available to testify; and offer evidence, exhibits, and 
material to support your claim. 

You should maintain original documents of evidence in your files and present copies to the 

court, unless otherwise instructed. Evidence may be any 
documents, such as receipts, photographs, contracts or letters 
that support your claim. Exhibits may be documents that 
explain your claim.

If the defendant ignores the summons and fails to appear 

in court, you must still appear and present your evidence. 
The judge issues a verdict, awarding possession of the 
property and the amount of damages, if any.

Right to a Jury Trial
If you want a jury trial, the case 
will be transferred to circuit 
court. 

Right to Appeal

Both parties have the right to 

appeal verdicts in District Court 

cases.

Mediation: an Alternative
The District Court’s Alternative Dispute 

Resolution Program (ADR) offers mediation free of 
charge. It is less formal, time-consuming and costly 
than going to court. A trained mediator works with 
both sides to resolve the problem and come up with 
a mutually agreeable solution. If mediation proves 
unsuccessful, you may still seek resolution in court.

It is the mission of the District Court 

of Maryland to provide equal and exact justice for 
all who are involved in 
litigation before the court.

DC/CV 4BR (Rev. 8/2010)

 

√   You own a furniture rental company and a customer has not 
paid the rental fee. How do you get the furniture back?

√   Your former roommate damaged your television. Can you get 

compensated?

What are Replevins 
and Detinues?

 A replevin is a legal action that allows you to 

seek the immediate return of property prior to 
a trial. A detinue seeks the return of property or 
compensation for its value, but does not allow for 
a hearing prior to trial to determine immediate 
possession of property.

Both a replevin and a detinue require a trial 
to determine who is the rightful owner of the 
property and any possible damages.

Replevin

Seeks the return of property and possible 

damages. You may be required to file: 

1. Complaint (form DC/CV1),
2. Proof of Service (form DC/CV 2), and
3. Show Cause Order (form DC/CV4). 

These forms are filed in the District Court, 
regardless of the amount in dispute. This action 
provides for a Show Cause hearing where 
immediate possession of property may be 
determined prior to a trial.

Detinue

Seeks the return of property or 

compensation for its value and possible 
damages. This action requires only the filing of 
the Complaint form.

You file in District Court for actions up to 

$5,000. If the claim is between $5,000 and 
$30,000, the form may be filed in either the 
District or a circuit court. Detinues for more 
than $30,000 must be filed in a circuit court.

Do You Need a Lawyer?

Filing either a replevin or a detinue does not 

require the services of a lawyer. However, a 
lawyer will offer you legal advice and protect 
your interests before the court. 

You should consider your skills in 
explaining your case to the judge, your 
understanding of the law, and your willingness 
to spend time and resources on the case. 
Corporations and other business entities are 
required to be represented by a lawyer. 

How to File a Claim

Filing a replevin or detinue requires four steps:

1.    You [the plaintiff] file with the court the Complaint form. In the case of a replevin, 

you also must file the Request for Service and the Show Cause Order.

2.    You pay the filing fee. A fee also may apply if you want the court to “serve” the 

3.    The court issues a Writ of Summons and/or a Show Cause Order to officially notify the 

defendant with the summons.

defendant that a suit has been filed. 

4.    Proof is submitted to the court that the defendant has been served the summons.

How to Complete a Complaint Form

The Complaint form details the most important facts about your case; 

it tells the court:

•   the name and address of the person(s) or business bringing the suit,
•   the name and address of the person(s) or business against whom you are filing,
•   why you are filing the claim, and
•   the remedy you are seeking (return of property, replacement value, damages, etc.).

It is important to use proper and complete names and addresses. If filing against a business, 

always use the full, formal business name and include the name of the person to be served. 
Be sure that all information is accurate; mistakes could cause your case to be delayed 
or dismissed. If you have questions about the form, speak to a District Court clerk or see the 
Court’s Small Claims brochure.

How to Serve the Summons

In order for your case to be heard in court, the defendant must be served the proper forms 
within the time frame specified and according to the law. The summons can be served only by 
certified mail, private process server (a person or business hired to deliver the summons) or 
by a sheriff or constable. If you are serving the defendant by private process server, it is your 
responsibility to notify the court that the defendant has been served properly. Failure to serve a 
summons properly may lead to dismissal of the 
case.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
