Frequently Asked Questions

Can an Employer Discharge an Employee Because of a Garnishment?

No, an employee may not be discharged because wages are subject to garnishment 
for any one indebtedness within a calendar year. An employer who willfully violates 
this provision is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000, 
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.

Can Wages Be Garnished for Child or Spousal Support?

Yes, but the District Court does not handle these cases. You must file in circuit 

court.

Can a Debtor or Garnishee Defend Against a Garnishment?

Yes. A debtor or garnishee has the right to object to a garnishment at any time.  

To object, file an appropriate motion with the court.

Can a Debtor’s Bank Account be Garnished?

Yes. To garnish a bank account, file a Request for Garnishment of Property Other 

than Wages (DC-CV-060). You must provide the name and address of the debtor’s 
financial institution. The garnishee is served and must reply within 30 days with a 
Confession of Assets, a list of assets belonging to the creditor held by the bank. You 
will receive a copy. 

After 30 days have passed since the original request, you file a Request for 
Judgment-Garnishment (DC-CV-062) with the court and send copies to both the 
debtor and garnishee. 

If you do not seek to enforce or dismiss the writ within 120 days after the 

garnishee's answer is filed, after proper 
notice to both the judgment debtor and 
judgment creditor, the garnishee may 
request to terminate the writ.

If the judge decides in your favor, the 

garnishee will be ordered to pay the 
funds from the debtor’s account.

 Note
 All motions, statements, answers to
 interrogatories and other papers filed
 with the court must be sent to all
 parties (creditor, debtor, garnishee and
 attorney, if any) involved in the case.

If money is owed to you and you have obtained a court judgment, you 
may be able to collect through a process called “wage garnishment.” 

 Responsibilities of Garnishee

    Responsibilities of Creditor

What is Wage Garnishment?

Wage garnishment is a procedure through which some portion of a person’s (debtor) 

earnings is withheld by an employer (garnishee) for the payment of a debt to a 
creditor (person who is owed the money). 

What Amount Can Be Garnished?

Federal law limits the amount of earnings that may be garnished to 25 percent of the 

debtor’s disposable income. (Disposable earnings are the amount of earnings left after 
legally required deductions e.g., federal, state taxes, Social Security, unemployment 
insurance and medical insurance.)

 However, for individuals earning minimum or near minimum wage, the debtor must 
be left with an amount equal to 30 times the State minimum hourly wage multiplied by 
the number of weeks during which the wages due were earned. 

Example 
   Debtor earns $13.25 per hour, (State minimum wage).  
    Weekly gross earnings = $530.00 (40 hrs. x $13.25).   
    Subtract deductions; disposable earnings =  $410.00. 
    30 x $13.25 (State minimum wage) = $397.50.   
    $397.50 x 1 (number of weeks during which the wages due were earned) = $397.50    
    $410.00 - $397.50 = $12.50.  
    Amount that can be garnished:  $12.50 each week. 

What Are the Steps?
1.   Before you can garnish wages, you must obtain a final judgment or order against 

the debtor in court. 

  
2.   After you obtain a judgment, you file a Request for Writ of Garnishment of Wages 
(DC-CV-065). To complete the form, you need to know the name and address of 
the debtor’s employer, the amount of the judgment and any additional money 
owed (such as court costs and interest.)

3.   A writ or court order is then "served" or delivered to the debtor’s employer 

(garnishee). (Service is not permitted by ordinary mail. Service must be provided 
by the sheriff or constable, by "return receipt requested" registered mail, or by a 
person at least 18 years of age and not a party to the suit.)

Upon receipt of the writ, the garnishee 
must:

1.  Reply to the writ within 30 days 
of receipt, indicating on the form 
whether the debtor is employed, 
the rate of pay, and any prior 
garnishments on wages. 

2.  Determine the amount of the 

“garnishable wages” for each pay 
period and withhold this amount from 
the employee. 

3.  Report and distribute to the creditor 

or creditor’s attorney the total amount 
of wages withheld for the month, 
within 15 days after the close of the 
employee’s last pay period in the 
month. If another garnishment or 
judgment is received, follow the same 
procedures, but remittance to a second 
or subsequent creditor is not made 
until the first judgment is paid in full. 
When one judgment is paid, the lien of 
the next one is in effect.

4.  Notify the court and all parties if the 

debtor stops working or is terminated. 
The garnishment terminates 90 days 
after end of employment unless the 
debtor is re-employed during that 
period. 

1.  If an alleged employer reports that the 
debtor is not employed, creditor must 
file a request for a hearing within 15 
days, or the court may dismiss the 
garnishment. File your request in 
writing or on a Request/Order form 
(DC-001).

2.  When you receive payment from 

any garnishment on wages or from 
any other payments or credits, you 
must provide a Judgment Creditor’s 
Monthly Report (DC-CV-066) to both 
the debtor and garnishee within 15 
days after the end of any month in 
which payments are received. (You 
do not have to file this form with the 
court.) This form shows all payments 
credited during that month and the 
method used to determine the amount 
withheld.

3.  Payments received from any source 

shall be credited, first against accrued 
interest on the unpaid balance of the 
judgment principal; second, against 
the principal; and third, against 
attorney’s fees and costs assessed 
against the debtor.

4.  File with the court a Notice of 

Satisfaction (DC-CV-031) within 15 
days after the judgment has been paid 
in full.

Penalties

If the garnishee fails to comply with the 
provisions of the law, they may be cited for 
contempt of court and assessed attorney’s 
fees and court costs. 

Penalties

If the creditor fails to comply with the 
provisions of the law, the garnishment may 
be dismissed and creditor may be assessed 
attorney’s fees and costs.
