NOTE: Guardianship cases can be complicated. You may want to speak with a lawyer. 

WHAT IS GUARDIANSHIP OF THE PERSON OR PROPERTY OF AN ALLEGED DISABLED 
PERSON? 

Guardianship of the person: A court will appoint a guardian of an alleged disabled person if it determines 
by clear and convincing evidence that a person (the alleged disabled person): 

1.  cannot make or communicate responsible decisions about themself because of mental disability, 

disease, habitual drunkenness, or addiction to drugs, AND 

2. 

there is no less restrictive form of intervention available. 

If appointed, the guardian of the person will make decisions about that individual’s health care, food, 
clothing, shelter, and other related matters. 

Guardianship of the property: A court will appoint a guardian of the property if it determines that the 
alleged disabled person: 

1. 

is unable to manage their property or affairs because of physical or mental disability, disease, 
habitual drunkenness, addiction to drugs, imprisonment, compulsory hospitalization, detention by a 
foreign power, or disappearance, AND 

2.  has or may be entitled to property or benefits which require proper management. 

If appointed, the guardian of the property will make decisions about that individual’s money, income, stocks 
and bonds, and other financial matters. The guardian of the property may be required to post a bond.  

Guardianship of person and property – A person may be appointed as guardian of both person and 
property of an alleged disabled person.

WHO CAN FILE FOR GUARDIANSHIP? 

Only interested persons can file for guardianship. Interested persons are defined by law. See paragraph 8 of 
the Petition for Guardianship of Alleged Disabled Person (form CC-GN-002) for a list of interested persons. 

If you are not an interested person but are concerned about risks to the personal or financial well-being of 
the alleged disabled person if a guardian is not appointed, it is recommended that you speak with a lawyer. 

HOW DO I FILE FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF AN ALLEGED DISABLED PERSON? 

If you are filing the guardianship case, you are the Petitioner. Use the CC-GN forms. There are five (5) 
steps: 
☐ STEP 1. Complete a Petition for Guardianship of Alleged Disabled Person (form CC-GN-002). 

CC-GN-002 Form Tips: 

• If you are a co-petitioner (another person joining the filing for guardianship of the disabled 

person), complete and sign a Co-Petitioner Information Sheet (form CC-GN-018). 

• Designation of a Guardian of the Property – The alleged disabled person can designate who 

they would like the court to appoint as a guardian of the property. Have them complete and sign 
the Designation of a Guardian of the Property by a Minor or Disabled Person (form CC-GN-009) 
and file the original with your petition. 

• Paragraph 6: If you are asking the court to appoint another person as guardian of the person or 

property, ask that person to complete and sign the Prospective Guardian Information Sheet 
 (form CC-GN-023) and file the original with your petition. 

• Paragraph 11(b): Under Maryland law, (Estates and Trusts Article, § 13-705 (b)), a court will 
only appoint a guardian of the person if there is no less restrictive form of intervention available 
that is consistent with the alleged disabled person’s welfare and safety. Less restrictive 
alternatives to guardianship of the person include family guidance, adult protective services, case 
management, in-home services, transportation and food assistance, social service programs, 
alternative housing arrangements (e.g., assisted living programs, adult foster care, etc.), advance 
health care directives, and supported decision-making. List any alternatives that have been 
attempted.  

• Paragraph 12(b): List any less restrictive alternatives to guardianship of the property that have 
failed. Alternatives include use of a representative payee, power of attorney, banking services, 
joint ownership of bank accounts, court authorization of specific transactions, and trusts. 

• Required Exhibits: Gather all required exhibits and provide any additional information on 

separate sheets (page 6) 

o Health care professionals (licensed physicians, licensed psychologists, licensed certified 
social workers-clinical (LCSW-C), or nurse practitioners) who examine or evaluate 
alleged disabled persons must use the following forms: 
•  Physician’s Certificate (form CC-GN-019) 
•  Psychologist’s Certificate (form CC-GN-020) 
•  Licensed Certified Social Worker-Clinical (LCSW-C) Certificate  

•  Nurse Practitioner’s Certificate (form CC-GN-050) (for petitions filed on or after 

(form CC-GN-021) 

October 1, 2020 only) 

C-GNIN-002 (Rev. 01/2021) 

Page 2 of 6 

 

    C

• One evaluation or examination must have occurred within 21 days before the filing of the 

petition. Attach the original certificate(s) to the petition. 

o If you are not able to have the alleged disabled person seen by a health care professional 
because they live with or are under the control of someone who refuses to allow the 
examination or evaluation, complete the Petition for Appointment of Health Care 
Professionals (form CC-GN-033), and attach it to the petition.  

☐ STEP 2. File for Guardianship – The completed petition and required exhibits should be filed with the 
Clerk of the Court in the appropriate court. 

Where to File for Guardianship – If the alleged disabled person lives in Maryland, file in the circuit 
court in the county (or Baltimore City) in which they are living. Do not file in the county (or Baltimore 
City) where you live unless you live in the same county as the alleged disabled person. 

If the alleged disabled person does not live in Maryland, file in the circuit court in any county (or 
Baltimore City) in which they are physically present. 

If you are requesting a guardianship of the property, file in any county (or Baltimore City) where the 
alleged disabled person has property, such as a house or bank account. 
 

The court requires you to pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford the filing fees, ask the court to waive the fees 
at the beginning of your case by filing a Request for Waiver of Prepaid Costs (form CC-DC-089). 
See General Instructions (form CC-DRIN) for information on fees and court costs. 

The court will assign your petition a case number. Remember your case number. Keep a copy of the 
petition and all attachments for your records.  

The court will issue a show cause order that includes: 

• the date by which service must be completed (STEP 3); 
• the date by which the alleged disabled person and interested persons need to respond or “show 
cause” as to why they think a guardianship is not necessary or why a proposed guardian should 
not be appointed.  

The show cause order may also include the date of the guardianship hearing (STEP 5). 

If the alleged disabled person does not have an attorney of their own choosing the court will appoint one for 
them 

☐ STEP 3. Service of Process – Service of process is the way the court makes sure that all necessary 
people receive copies of your guardianship petition. Your case cannot move forward until proper service is 
made.  

You must serve the alleged disabled person, their attorney, AND all interested persons (see Paragraph 
8 of form CC-GN-002 for a list of interested persons). If the alleged disabled person lives with you (the 
petitioner), service must be made on the alleged disabled person and any additional person named by the 
court.  

Each person to be served must receive: 
1)  A copy of the petition; 
2)  Any papers filed with the court; and 
3)  The show cause order issued by the court.  

C-GNIN-002 (Rev. 01/2021) 

Page 3 of 6 

  C

You must also serve the alleged disabled person with an Advice of Rights. Use form CC-GN-015 if asking 
for a guardianship of the person and/or form CC-GN-016 if asking for guardianship of the property. 

You must also serve interested persons with a Notice to Interested Persons. Use form CC-GN-005 if asking 
for a guardianship of the person and/or form CC-GN-006 if asking for a guardianship of the property. 

 STEP 4. File proof of service with the court – File proof that all necessary people have been properly 

served with the required papers. If you were unable to contact, locate, or identify any interested person, 
complete and sign an Affidavit of Attempts to Contact, Locate, and Identify Interested Persons  
(form CC-GN-010) and file it with the court.  

 ☐

For information about service, see General Instructions (form CC-DRIN) and the Self-Help Video, “Service 
of Process” available at: mdcourts.gov/video/selfhelp/serviceofprocess.html. 

☐ STEP 5. Hearing – The court will schedule a hearing after it receives 

• the petition,  

• proof that all required people were properly served, AND 

• notice that the alleged disabled person has an attorney. 

A hearing helps the court decide if the alleged disabled person needs a guardian and, if so, who should be 
appointed. It is important that you attend the hearing and bring all papers related to the case. If the alleged 
disabled person or an interested person contests (challenges) your request for guardianship, contact a lawyer 
before the hearing.  

WHO CAN BE A GUARDIAN? 

The court may appoint anyone who is qualified and capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of a guardian. 
Maryland law provides a list of potential guardians in order of preference  
(Md. Code Ann., Est. & Trusts § 13-707). 

If you have been convicted of certain crimes, you may not be eligible to become a guardian. Unless good 
cause is shown for the appointment, the court may not appoint someone who has been convicted of any of 
the following crimes listed under Md. Code Ann., Estates and Trusts, Article § 11-114: 

• A felony 

• A crime of violence as defined in § 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article, which include: 

o  Abduction; 
o  arson in the first degree; 
o  kidnapping; 
o  manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter; 
o  mayhem; 
o  maiming, as previously proscribed under former Article 27, §§ 385 and 386 of the Maryland Code; 
o  murder; 
rape; 
o 
o 

robbery under § 3-402 of the Criminal Law Article; 

CC-GNIN-002 (Rev. 01/2021) 

Page 4 of 6 

sexual offense in the first degree; 

o  carjacking; 
o  armed carjacking; 
o 
o 
o  use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or other crime of violence; 
o  child abuse in the first degree under § 3-601 of the Criminal Law Article; 
sexual abuse of a minor under § 3-602 of the Criminal Law Article if: 
o 

sexual offense in the second degree; 

the victim is under the age of 13 years and the offender is an adult at the time of the offense; 

 

 

and 

the offense involved: 

• vaginal intercourse, as defined in § 3-301 of the Criminal Law Article; 

• a sexual act, as defined in § 3-301 of the Criminal Law Article; 

• an act in which a part of the offender’s body penetrates, however slightly, into the victim’s 

genital opening or anus; or 

• the intentional touching, not through the clothing, of the victim’s or the offender’s genital, 

anal, or other intimate area for sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse. 

o  an attempt to commit any of the crimes listed above; 
o  continuing course of conduct with a child under § 3-315 of the Criminal Law Article; 
o  assault in the first degree; 
o  assault with intent to murder; 
o  assault with intent to rape; 
o  assault with intent to rob; 
o  assault with intent to commit a sexual offense in the first degree; and 
o  assault with intent to commit a sexual offense in the second degree. 

• Assault in the second degree; or 
• A sexual offense in the third or fourth degree or attempted rape or sexual offense in the third or fourth 

degree. 

Other convictions may prevent you from becoming a guardian of the property. Unless good cause is shown 
for the appointment, the court may not appoint someone as a guardian of the property who has been 
convicted of a crime that reflects negatively on that person’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness to perform 
the guardianship duties. Those crimes include fraud, extortion, embezzlement, forgery, perjury, and theft. 

f the proposed guardian has been convicted of a disqualifying crime, there will be an opportunity to 
explain to the court why there is good cause for the court to still make the appointment.

WHAT ARE THE GUARDIAN ORIENTATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS? 

efore the court appoints you as a guardian of the person or property, you must watch the orientation 

program for court-appointed guardians available at 
mdcourts.gov/family/guardianship/guardianorientationprogram. This brief video covers the role, duties, and 
responsibilities, of a guardian and what to expect if appointed. If you do not have access to a computer or 
need help watching the program, contact the court. 

fter watching the video, complete a Certificate of Completion – Guardian Orientation and Training 

Program (form CC-GN-031) and file it with the court. 

fter the court appoints you as guardian, it will direct you to complete a training program. The program 

covers your specific responsibilities as guardian in more detail, describes how to make decisions as a 
guardian, and provides information about community resources available to help you and the person you 
care for. Guardians of the person must complete the training within 120 days of appointment. Guardians of 
the property must complete the training within 60 days of appointment. The court may direct you to 
complete the training at another time. 

ome courts offer the training program as a class you can attend. Some may allow you to complete the 

training program online. Ask the court how you can meet the training requirement. 

isit mdcourts.gov/guardianship for more information about the court-appointed guardian orientation and 

training programs. This website also has checklists, court forms, and other resources for guardians.
