DC-CV-001DBR (08/2021)

nsecured consumer debt is money you owe to a creditor who does not have a lien on 
any of your property and includes most credit card debt, medical bills, and personal loans.

What is debt?
Debt is money that you owe to someone.  

 U

Assigned consumer debt is a debt that one person or company has bought from another 
person or company. (Md. Rule 3-306(d)). There is a specific form the plaintiff must use - 
Complaint - Assigned Consumer Debt (DC-CV-106). For assigned consumer debt cases, the 
plaintiff must: (1) prove the debt exists; (2) complete the required checklist; (3) supply proof 
of terms and conditions; and (4) submit proper documentation.

If I don’t pay a debt, can I be sued?
Yes. If you don’t pay, the creditor or debt collector may file a lawsuit against you. You should 
respond to the lawsuit by the deadline; otherwise, you could lose by default. If the creditor 
wins the lawsuit, the court will award them a judgment against you. A judgment is a final 
court order that states you owe money to the creditor. If a creditor has a judgment against 
you, they may be able to garnish part of your wages, your bank account, or other property.

Debt Collection Laws

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law that prohibits debt 
collectors from engaging in abusive or deceptive bill collection practices.  

The Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act (MCDCA), adds significant protections 
to consumers because it covers activity by both debt collectors and creditors. In most 
situations, the FDCPA only covers debt collectors. 

A creditor is the company to whom you owe money, 
such as the bank who issued you a credit card. 

A debt collector is someone who collects debts for 
others. Collection agencies and law firms often act 
as debt collectors.

I was sued...what steps can I take next?
•  If you disagree with all or part of the claim, complete and send to the court the Notice of 

Intention to Defend located at the bottom of the summons. The court date may change after 
you file. If you do not return the Intention to Defend, a judgment could be entered 
against you.

•  Raise a procedural question such as: were you properly served? are you being sued in the 

correct court and the correct location? 

•  File a counterclaim within ten (10) days after the time for filing the Notice of Intention to 

Defend. Filing and service fees apply. If you cannot afford the fees, you can complete and 
file a Request for Waiver of Prepaid Costs (CC-DC-089).

•  Try to negotiate a settlement
•  Agree to a payment arrangement
•  Contact the plaintiff/Alternative Dispute Resolution Office if you are interested in mediation.
     - For information about Alternative Dispute Resolution, visit mdcourts.gov/district/adr/public
•  Prepare for trial:
     - Decide what evidence you need to defend the claim.
     - Gather documents and request witnesses to appear if needed. 
     - Document events that have happened.
     - Prepare to present the evidence in court.
What happens in court?
•  The plaintiff will present their side and then you will be able to present your defense. Unless 
the case is a small claim (amount claimed is $5,000.00 or less), the rules of evidence and 
procedure apply to your case, even if you aren’t familiar with them. The judge is not allowed 
to help you present your case; the judge must be neutral. This is one of many reasons why 
you may want to be represented by a lawyer. After hearing all the admissible evidence, the 
judge will decide in favor of you or the person who sued you.

 

What steps can I take if I don’t agree with the judge’s decision?
•  File a motion to request a new trial: 
- Use the Motion form (DC-002). 
- File within 10 days after the date of the judgment. 
- State your reasons why you think the judge made the wrong decision.

•  Ask the court to correct the judgment (usually for clerical errors): 

- Use the Motion form (DC-002). 
- File within 10 days after the date of the judgment.

•  Ask the court to change or cancel the judgment (clerical errors, lack of service or notification of a 

trial date).

•  Appeal to the Circuit Court: 

- You have 30 days after the judgment date to file. 
- Filing fees apply. If you cannot afford the fees, file a Request for Waiver of Prepaid Costs (CC-DC-089). 
- Use the form, Civil Appeal (DC-CV-037).

What actions can the plaintiff (judgment creditor) take to collect a 
judgment?
• 

If you don’t pay the judgment or work out arrangements, the judgment creditor can send you 
a Judgment Debtor Information Sheet (CC-DC-CV-114) for you to fill out with information 
about your employment, assets, debts, income and expenses. If you don’t respond 
completely and by the due date, you may have to answer written questions (interrogatories) 
under penalty of perjury or appear in court to answer the questions (Oral Exam) or both.

•  Put a lien against your property and if the debt is not paid, seize the property.
•  Garnish your wages. You must be left with an amount equal to 30 times the Maryland 
minimum hourly wage. No more than 25% of your wages can be garnished per pay 
period. See Wage Garnishment Brochure (DC-CV-065BR) for more information on wage 
garnishment.

•  Garnish property other than wages. There is no limit on a bank account or other assets, but 

there are exemptions. 

Can I keep any of my money or property?
You can request an exemption of up to $6,000 for any reason. You may qualify for another 
exemption if the money in your bank account came from:     

•  Social Security benefits (disability and 

retirement)

•  Veterans benefits and other federal benefits 

listed here
•  Child support
•  State public assistance benefits (SNAP, 

•  Workers compensation
•  Unemployment insurance
•  Alimony
•  A bank account opened before the 

judgment was entered in the name of two 
persons who are married

•  Qualified retirement benefits (401k, IRA, 

TCA, etc.)

pensions)

To claim an exemption, file a Motion for Release of Property from Levy/Garnishment 
(DC-CV-036) within 30 days after the papers are served. (See the back of the DC-CV-060, 
Request for Writ of Garnishment of Property Other than Wages, for exemption information.)

What happens when I pay the debt?
The judgment debtor is required to file a Notice of Satisfaction. If they do not, you can complete 
and file form, Motion for Order Declaring Judgment Satisfied (DC-CV-051). You must serve 
the creditor with a copy by certified mail, sheriff, or private process. You may be eligible for the 
money you spent to get the order, including reasonable attorney fees.

website at: mdcourts.gov/legalhelp/moneyissuesiowe
