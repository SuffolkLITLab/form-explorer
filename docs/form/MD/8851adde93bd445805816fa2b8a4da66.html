      <pre>How to Expunge 

Court Records

Expungement

Scan the above QR Code to find more 
information about expungements from the 
Judiciary’s website 

This brochure details the process of the 
expungement of adult criminal case records 
and eligible civil citations. For information 
related to the expungement of juvenile 
records, please contact the juvenile division of 
the circuit court where the case was filed. 

Contact information can be found at: 
mdcourts.gov/circuit

For more information on Maryland courts and their 
procedures,  please  contact  a  clerk  in  any  state  or 
county courthouse. 

For more information about the Maryland Judiciary,

It is the mission of the  

Maryland Judiciary to provide equal and exact 
justice for all who are involved in  
litigation before the court.

CC-DC-CR-072BR (Rev. 09/2022)

Am I eligible? / Am I not eligible?
Refer to Criminal Procedure Article §§ 10-105, 10-107, and 10-110 for specific filing 
requirements for eligibility.
You are NOT eligible:

 ° unless ALL charges in your case can be expunged. (If two or more charges arise 

from the same incident, they are considered a unit. However, minor traffic charges 
are not part of the unit. Related minor traffic charges that arise out of the same 
incident do not affect your right to expungement of other charges in the unit.)

 ° if you are a defendant in an active criminal case, including jailable traffic violations. 
However, if the case you are trying to expunge was closed with a verdict of not 
guilty, nolle prosequi, acquittal, or dismissal, you may be eligible.

 ° if you received a Probation Before Judgment (PBJ) and within three years of 
receiving the PBJ you were convicted of a new offense. (The PBJ cannot be 
expunged if the new conviction is not eligible for expungement.)

 ° if you were convicted or received a PBJ for Driving While Intoxicated or Driving 

While Under the Influence.

 ° if your case includes minor traffic charges only. The court does not have the 

authority to expunge minor traffic offenses. Only the MVA can expunge minor traffic 
offenses. See Transportation Article § 16-117.1.

Civil cases, including child support, liens, judgments, peace orders and protective orders 
CANNOT be expunged. 
If there are outstanding fines/fees, court costs, or restitution, your petition for expungement 
may be denied by the court. 
When to File for Expungement:
Certain misdemeanor convictions may be expunged after 10 years.

Certain felony convictions and domestically related misdemeanor assault convictions may 
be expunged after 15 years.

For a list of expungable guilty offenses and the appropriate times to file, please see form 
CC-DC-CR-072G2.
Pardon – If you want to clear your record of a conviction that is not eligible for 
expungement, you must first get a pardon from the Governor. An expungement based on a 
pardon must be filed within 10 years from the date the Governor signed the pardon.  For 
more information on this process, you may contact the Maryland Parole Commission at 
1-877-241-5428 or visit: dpscs.state.md.us/agencies/mpc.shtml
Where do I File My Petition for Expungement?
In general, you will file your petition for expungement in the court where the case was 
concluded. 

If your case was appealed, remanded, or transferred, please consult with an attorney, or 
the Court Help Center at 410-260-1392 or visit: mdcourts.gov/helpcenter 

What does it Cost to File for Expungement? Can 
the Fees be Waived?
There is no charge to expunge a case with a disposition of acquittal, not guilty, dismissal, 
PBJ, nolle prosequi, stet, or NCR.

here is a $30 fee to file a petition for expungement of records with a guilty disposition 
(CC-DC-CR-072B). Filing fees are non-refundable. If you cannot afford the fee, you may 
request that the court waive the filing fee by filing a Request for Waiver of Prepaid Costs 
(CC-DC-089). 

  T

Do I need to File a Petition? If so, which Petition 
should I file?
After October 1, 2021, any case that resulted in acquittal, dismissal, not guilty, or 
nolle prosequi will be automatically expunged after three (3) years if you take no 
action. However, you do not have to wait for the automatic expungement, and you 
may want to file a petition. 
There are three (3) types of Petitions for Expungement of Records: 
Use form CC-DC-CR-072A - Acquittal, Dismissal, PBJ, Nolle Prosequi, Stet, or Not Criminally Responsible if:

 

 

 

 

 

 

your petition is based on an acquittal, not guilty, a nolle prosequi, or a dismissal. 
You may file three (3) years after disposition. You may file earlier than three (3) 
years if you sign and file a General Waiver and Release of all of your legal claims 
arising from the charge.
your petition is based on a PBJ. You may file after probation is completed or 
three (3) years after probation was granted, whichever date is later. However, if 
your probation was completed in less than three (3) years, you may file a motion 
for a good cause exception and the court will decide whether there is good cause 
to grant an early expungement.
the petition is based on a stet. You may file three (3) years after the case was 
marked stet on the docket. However, if it is less than three (3) years you may file a 
motion for a good cause exception and the court will decide whether there is good 
cause to grant an early expungement.
the petition is based on a finding of Not Criminally Responsible (NCR) for specified 
nuisance crimes such as, but not limited to, urinating in public or open container. 
You may file three (3) years after the NCR finding is made.

Use form CC-DC-CR-072B - Guilty Disposition if:

your petition is based on a guilty disposition.

Use form CC-DC-CR-072C - Acquittal, Dismissal, Not Guilty, or Nolle Prosequi (Less than 3 Years Has 
Passed Since Disposition) if: 

you would like to file to have your case expunged before the case is scheduled 
to be automatically expunged. A case will be automatically expunged in three (3) 
years if the case was closed with a final disposition of acquittal, not guilty, dismissal, 
or nolle prosequi.

I want to Expunge a Guilty Charge:
If you were found guilty, you may still be eligible for expungement. 
A person is eligible to file if they were convicted of: 
a criminal offense that is no longer a crime.
certain nuisance crimes.
cannabis possession under Criminal Law Article § 5-601.
specified crimes under Criminal Procedure Article § 10-110.

 
 
 
 

A person is also eligible to file if they received a citation for civil possession of cannabis under 
Criminal Law Article § 5-601.1.

What Can I Expect After Expungement?
The expungement process takes about 90 days from the date that you file your petition. 
  The State’s Attorney’s Office has 30 days from when they receive the petition to 

 

object to any petition for expungement.
If no objection is filed after 30 days, the court will issue an order to any agency 
involved in the case and they have 60 days to comply with the court’s order to 
expunge the records. 

You will receive a Certificate of Compliance in the mail to notify you that your expungement 
has been completed.

The Criminal Justice Information Service (CJIS) handles expungements for the entire State 
of Maryland. Expungements are processed in the order in which they are received, but 
CJIS compliance may take longer than 60 days.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
