(4) I am voluntarily and unequivocally consenting to the transfer of legal and physical

believe that the adoption of the minor is in the minor's best interest.

(5) I understand that I may revoke this consent by notifying the court in writing within 21 days
after this consent is executed that I wish to revoke this consent. (I understand that if I and the
prospective parents agree, we may jointly revoke this consent anytime before finalization of the
adoption. If the prospective adoptive parents do not agree to revoke after the 21 day period then 
the consent becomes irrevocable on the 22nd day after its execution.) I understand that if this
consent is obtained by fraud or duress, or if an adoption petition is not filed within 45 days after
the minor was placed for adoption without good cause, then I may petition the court to have this
consent revoked. The petition may be filed in the court in which the adoption is pending, if
known, or in the court in which this consent is signed.

  (c) I am signing this consent voluntarily; 
  (d) I have received a copy of this consent; 
  (e) Before signing this consent, I have been informed of the meaning and consequences of
adoption. I understand that, unless otherwise provided in this consent, my signing of this consent
and failure to revoke the consent terminates any right I may have to object to the minor's
adoption by the prospective adoptive parent(s). I also have been informed about the
consequences of misidentifying the other parent of this child and the procedure for releasing
information about health, characteristics, and identity of myself to the adoptee; 
  (f) If I am a minor, I certify that I was advised by an attorney who is not representing the
adoptive parent or the adoption agency to which the child is being relinquished; the name of the
attorney is __________________________ and he or she is present as this consent is being
executed; 
  (g) If I am an adult, I certify that I was informed of my right to have an attorney represent me in
this matter who is not representing the adoptive parent or representing the adoption agency to
which the child is being relinquished; 
  (h) I have provided to the adoptive parents, or their agent, nonidentifying information and
information about the child's and my family's health history and background as required by 15A
V.S.A. § 2-105, and I understand that before the adoption becomes final, if information becomes
available to me which was unavailable previously, then I have an obligation to provide this
information; 
  (i) I have been made aware that it is in the best interests of the adoptee that I keep the court or
the adoption agency informed of my current address and any family health problems of mine
which may develop which could affect the child so that the court or agency may respond to any
inquiry concerning the adoptee's medical or social history. I have also been made aware of the
procedure for releasing information about the health and other characteristics of the parent which
may affect the physical or psychological well-being of the adoptee and the procedure for release
of the parent's identity pursuant to Article 6 of the Vermont Adoption Act. 

  (j) I have not received or been promised any money, or anything of value, in exchange for my
executing this consent except for payments which are authorized under 15A V.S.A. § 7-103 and
which are itemized on an attachment to this consent; I (circle one) have/have not been a recipient
of public assistance during the last 12 months; 
  (k) The minor child (circle one) is/is not an Indian Child as defined in the Indian Child Welfare
Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1901 et seq. 
  (l ) That I (choose one) 
   [ ] waive notice of any proceeding for adoption of the adoptee; 
   [ ] waive notice of the adoption unless the adoption is contested, appealed or denied; 
   [ ]  do not waive notice of any proceeding for adoption and I would like to be notified at my
address as set forth above; 
  (m) I understand that the adoption will make any orders or agreements for visitation or
communication with the minor unenforceable; 
  (n) I understand that after this consent has been executed in compliance with § 2-405 and not
revoked in compliance with § 2-408 or § 2-409, then the consent becomes final and may not be
revoked or set aside for any reason, including the failure of the adoptive parent or agency to
permit me to visit or communicate with the minor adoptee. I further understand that this consent
will extinguish all parental rights and obligations, and the adoption will completely terminate 
every aspect of the legal relationship which I may have concerning the minor, except for
arrearages of child support. 
  (o) That before executing this consent I was informed of the availability of personal counseling
by a certified adoption counselor, or other counselor of my choice and legal counseling. 

(8) If this consent is being made conditional upon other conditions which are authorized under
15A V.S.A. § 2-406(e), that those conditions are set forth with particularity here. (If none, so
state.) 
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
    
(9) I (circle one) have/have not participated as a party, witness, or in any other capacity in any
litigation or action concerning the custody or support of the above-named minor in Vermont or
any other state. I (circle one) have/have no knowledge of any person or adoption agency or state
agency who has physical or legal custody of the child, or who claims to have custody or
visitation rights with this child. (Any affirmative answer in this paragraph requires a description
of the action or claim, including the court and docket number if available.) 

  I swear that the factual information set forth in this consent is true and correct to the best of my
knowledge and belief. 

  Dated this ____ day of ______, _____, at ________________, County of ________________, 
and State of __________________.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
