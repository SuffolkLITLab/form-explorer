Notice

You have just been issued a 
CITATION to appear in COURT.  
This appearance in COURT is called 
an ARRAIGNMENT.  This notice tells 
you what to expect at this first court 
hearing and what you can do 
between now and then to prepare.

BEFORE YOU GET TO THE 
COURTHOUSE:
(cid:120) You may want to speak to a lawyer 
so that you will understand what to 
expect.

(cid:120) If you cannot afford a private 
lawyer, you can apply for the 
services of the public defender on 
the day of your arraignment. The 
court will consider your income 
and the income of any adult 
family members living with you in 
deciding whether to appoint a 
public defender.

(cid:120) If you are assigned the public 

defender, a minimum payment of 
$50 will be required unless you 
are found unable to pay.  

(cid:120) You may be required to pay for a 

part of the cost of the public 
defender’s services.   You may
need to pay some money (a down 
payment) on the day of your 
arraignment and some additional 
money within the next two months.

(cid:120) Go to the courtroom where the 
judge will explain your rights to 
you. The judge will ask you if 
you want to plead GUILTY;  
NOT GUILTY; or NO 
CONTEST. 

WHEN YOU GET TO THE
COURTHOUSE
(plan to be there for several hours):

(cid:120) If you are under 18 years old, 
your parent or guardian must
come to court with you.

(cid:120) You will receive several important 

court papers including the 
INFORMATION which explains the 
criminal charge against you, AND 
an AFFIDAVIT describing the 
alleged facts upon which the 
charge is based.

(cid:120) A public defender will be in court 

and will speak with you before the 
arraignment if assigned.

(cid:120) If you have your own attorney, 

make sure that he or she comes 
with you. It is not enough to tell the 
judge “I have a lawyer.” The lawyer 
must either be in court with you, or 
the lawyer must send a letter to the 
court saying that he or she 
represents you.

(cid:120) If you plead not guilty, the 

judge will decide whether to let 
you go based on your word 
that you will come back for 
future hearings (called 
PERSONAL 
RECOGNIZANCE) or that you 
will abide by certain restrictions 
while the case is pending 
(called CONDITIONS OF 
RELEASE). 

(cid:120) In a few cases, the judge may 
order you to deposit cash or 
other valuable security with the 
court (called BAIL).  Bail will be 
returned when your case is 
closed if you have appeared in 
court as requested.

(cid:120) IF YOU FAIL TO APPEAR 

FOR YOUR ARRAIGNMENT, 
THE COURT WILL ISSUE A 
WARRANT FOR YOUR 
ARREST.

Pretrial Screening

Pretrial Screening, Continued

Pretrial Screening, Continued

Individuals cited or arrested for 
certain offenses may be given the 
opportunity to participate in a Risk 
Assessment which asks about your 
criminal history and a Needs 
Screening which asks about your 
mental health and substance use. A 
person called a Pretrial Monitor will 
ask you these questions. 

Participation is voluntary. 

You may speak with a private 
attorney or a public defender before 
deciding whether to participate. 
Anyone may call a public defender 
regardless of personal finances. If 
you are uncertain about whether to 
participate you may wish to speak 
with an attorney first.

The Pretrial Monitor will not ask 
you about your charges and you 
should not discuss those charges 
with the Monitor.

Following the Risk Assessment and
Needs Screening, the Pretrial 
Monitor:

(cid:120) Will share the results with the 

prosecutor. The results cannot be

used against you to prove guilt.  

(cid:120) Will provide you information 

about other resources to help 
you address your areas of need 
and concern.  

If the prosecutor files your case 
with the court, the judge may also 
use the results of the Risk 
Assessment and Needs 
Screening in determining bail and 
conditions of release which can 
include ordering you to get a 
Clinical Mental Health and 
Substance Use Disorder 
Assessment and follow the 
recommendations which may 
include treatment. The specific 
details of the clinical assessment
will not be shared with the court.  

The prosecutor might also review 
the results of the Risk 
Assessment and Needs 
Screening and offer you the 
opportunity to participate in a 
program that does not involve filing 
your case with the court. This is 
called a Precharge Program.

The decision whether to offer you a 
Precharge Program is entirely up to 
the prosecutor.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
