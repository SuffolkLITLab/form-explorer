This booklet is intended to provide a basic overview of what to expect from 
your  lawyer  and  the  court.  It  is  very  important  to  talk  with  your  lawyer 
about anything happening in your case that you do not understand. 
 

What is "CHINS"? 

  “CHINS” is a term that stands for a CHild In Need of Care or Supervision. 

The job of the court is to keep your child safe and to help you create a safe home for your 
child.  The judge must decide what is best for your child, based on information that you and 
others provide. 
 

Why Do I  
Have to Go to Court? 

omeone is concerned about your child. Someone might have called the Child Protection 
Hotline to report a concern. Someone may have called the police.  When that happens, a 
Family  Services  social  worker  or  police  officer  looks  into  the  matter.  The  police  may 
deem the situation an emergency and contact the State’s Attorney.  If the social worker 
has  concerns  about  your  child’s  safety  or  well-being,  the  social  worker  contacts  the 
State’s Attorney (prosecutor).  

  The  Department  for  Children  and  Families,  Family  Services  Division  (DCF–Family 
Services), or police may have talked with you and other people who know you and your 
family. 

  The State’s Attorney filed a petition (form) in the Family Division of the Superior Court 
with an affidavit (written statements made under oath) describing why your child may 
need  care  or  supervision.  The  statements  can  be  from  DCF,  a  police  officer,  or  the 
concerned person. 

  As the child’s parent or guardian, you have a right to be at court hearings and to know 

what is going on.  

Back to Top 

   

What Happens Once the Court is Involved  
With My Family? 

  You will receive a copy of the paperwork.  This includes the petition and affidavit. 

  A hearing will be held. You are entitled to a lawyer. 

  The judge can require that you and your family get services.

 

It refers to a child who may be: 

  Abandoned 
  Abused 
  Neglected (not adequately cared for) 
  Beyond the parent’s control

  The judge can order that your child be temporarily placed in the custody of a friend or 
relative,  or  in  the  custody  of  the  DCF-Family  Services.  If  your  child  is  placed  in  DCF 
custody:  

  DCF would be legally responsible for your child. 

  DCF can make decisions about where your child will live and what you need to do 

before your child can return home.  

  The judge will review steps taken by DCF-Family Services to keep your child safe.  

  The  court  will  keep  you  informed  of  its  decisions.  You  should  receive  copies  of  any 

Orders issued by the judge. 

 
How Do I Know  
if I Need a Lawyer? 

  You  will  receive  a  notice  telling  you  when  you  must  appear  in  court.  This  is  called  a 

“Notice of Hearing.” 

If the Notice says that you have the right to a lawyer, you can hire a lawyer or ask the 
court to appoint one for you. 

If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, you can apply for one at the courthouse.  You may 
need to pay a fee on a sliding-scale basis.

What  Does  My Lawyer Do?  
Working with My Lawyer 

ost often, you will meet your lawyer for the first time at the courthouse before the hearing. 
(If your lawyer cannot be present for the first hearing, you should meet with him or her after 
the hearing.) 

  Your lawyer will: 

  Talk with you about what happened with your child 

  Help you understand your rights 

  Answer your questions 

  Tell you about the hearings you will attend  

  Tell you what to expect at each hearing 

  Speak for you in court 

  Explain to you what happened after each hearing 

  Keep you informed of future hearing dates  

  Return your phone calls. 

•  Lawyers are often busy in court so it may take a day or two for your lawyer to 

get back to you.

If  you  have  not  heard  from  your  lawyer,  call  him or  her  as  soon  as  possible.  If  you  have 
questions or problems, call your lawyer.  

 

If  you  have  a  court-appointed  lawyer  who  does  not  do  these  things,  you  can  tell  the 
judge during any hearing. You can also tell the Defender General, because that office 
oversees your lawyer.  

t  is  your  responsibility  to  let  your  lawyer  and  the  court  know  if  your  phone 
number or address changes.

  Others Who Will Be Involved with the Case 

he State’s Attorney (Prosecutor) 

The  State’s  Attorney  has  to  prove  why  your  child  is  in  need  of  care  or 
supervision.  The  State’s  Attorney  works  closely  with  the  DCF-Family  Services 
social worker. 

The Social Worker 
The DCF-Family Services social worker works  with children and families on the 
issues that brought them to court. Your social worker is looking out for the best 
interests of your child and wants to support your family to address the problems 
that caused the situation to be in court.  The social worker coordinates  referrals 
to  services  you may  need for your family  and  must  include  you  in developing  a 
case plan. The social worker makes recommendations to the court on what kinds 
of  supports  and  services  are  needed.  The  social  worker  gathers  information  to 
help the judge make decisions about what should happen with your case.   

Your Child’s Lawyer 
The court will appoint a lawyer to represent your child in court.  

The Guardian Ad Litem 
The court will appoint a Guardian ad Litem (GAL) as an independent advocate to 
look out for the best interests of your child. GALs are volunteers. Their role is to 
learn  as  much  as  they  can  about  your  child  and  your  family  to  make  impartial 
recommendations  to  the  court  about  what  they  think  is  best  for  your  child.  The 
GAL works closely with your child’s lawyer and with DCF, but does not work for 
either of them. 

The Judge 
The  judge  will  make  decisions  that  impact  you  and  your  child  based  on  the  information 
presented by each side in court.  The judge is guided by what is in your child’s best interest.

When Will I Have to Go to Court? 

 
You will be asked to attend several court hearings and other meetings so that the 
judge and others can listen to all sides and decide how to help your family. It is 
very important that you attend the hearings and meetings. 

 

t  is  also  important  that  the  court  and  your  attorney  be  able  to  get  in  touch  with  you,  so 
make sure you let them know if your address or phone number changes. 

emember:  the  purpose  of  the  court  proceedings  is  to  provide  for  the  care,  protection, 
education, and healthy development of your child. The court is concerned with your child’s 
safety and need for a stable, permanent home. The judge’s decision is based on what is 
best for your child. 

  Basic Steps in a CHINS Case 

ach hearing has a different purpose. Most court cases follow these basic steps: 

  Emergency Care Hearing (in emergency situations) 

  Temporary Care Hearing (within 72 hours if a child is taken into emergency custody)  

  Preliminary Hearing (if no emergency exists). This takes place 15 days from the filing of a 

Petition 

  Pre-Trial Hearing (15 days later) 

  Merits Hearing (60 days from the start of the case) 

  Disposition Hearing (35 days after Merits Hearing) 

  Post-Disposition Review Hearing (2 months later) 

  Case Plan Review (not held in court; this takes place every 6 months if a child is in foster 

care)   

  Permanency Hearing (12 months after a child is placed in foster care)

[6] 

What Happens in Court 

1.   Emergency Care Hearing 
  You may not know about the Emergency Care Hearing because it may be done 
quickly, in response to an emergency. The judge may be contacted over the 
phone by a police  officer if the officer believes that your child needs to be taken 
into immediate emergency custody. Or, the hearing may take place in court 
before you are able to get to the courthouse.

If the judge believes that your child is in immediate danger, the judge may issue 
an Emergency Care Order to protect your child’s safety and well-being. If this 
happens, there will be a Temporary Care Hearing in court within 72 hours to 
decide if the child can safely return home and what will happen next. 

  During those 72 hours, the child can be temporarily placed in an approved 

foster care home or with a relative. The DCF-Family Services worker will gather 
information to present to the court at the next hearing. 

If  the  case  does  not  begin  as  an  emergency,  it  will  likely  start  with  a 
Preliminary  Hearing  after  the  State’s  Attorney  files  a  Petition  with  the 
court. The next hearing would then be a Pre-Trial Hearing (see page 6). 

Back to Top 
                                                                                 

2.   Temporary Care Hearing 

  This  hearing  will  be  held  within  72  hours  (3  days)  of  the  Emergency  Care 

Hearing (not counting state holidays).  

  At the Temporary Care Hearing, the judge decides who should have temporary 
custody of your child. The judge may decide that your child should be returned 
to  your  care,  or  may  temporarily  transfer  custody  to  DCF-Family  Services  or 
another  person,  such  as  a  relative  or  close  friend.  Let  your  lawyer  or  social 
worker know if there are any relatives or close friends who can provide a safe 
home for your child. A non-custodial parent who wants custody of their child has 
to tell the judge how he or she can meet the child’s needs.   

If  the  judge  gives  temporary  custody  of  your  child  to  DCF,  that  doesn’t  mean 
that  your  child  will  never  return  home.  Most  children  return  home  once  the 
family has worked out the issues that brought the child into care. 

If DCF gets temporary custody of your child, DCF will decide where your child 
will live for the time being. 

  You  and  your  lawyer  will  talk  to  the  social  worker  about  setting  up  a 

schedule for you to see and/or talk with your child. 

  The judge can order DCF-Family Services to provide visits for you and your

or to refer you to services.

3.   Pre-Trial Hearing 

Preliminary Hearing. 

  This  hearing  is  held  15  days  after  the  Temporary  Care  Hearing  or  the 

  The  purpose  of  the  Pre-Trial  Hearing  is  to  discuss  whether  you  will  admit  or 
deny the allegations (accusations) in the petition. This means that you will have 
to decide whether to admit (agree) or deny (disagee) that your child is in need of 
care or supervision. 

  Before  the  hearing,  you  and  your  lawyer  will  talk  so  that  you  can  make  a 
decision. This is an important decision, because it affects what will happen with 
the rest of the case.  Be sure that you understand your choices and what they 
mean. Be sure that your lawyer explains this to you. 

  Next Steps: 

 

 

If you admit to the allegations in the petition, it is called reaching the “merits” 
of the case. The next step would be the  Disposition Hearing. 

If you deny the allegations in the petition, the next step is the Merits Hearing.  

 Status Conference may be held at any stage of the case. It is a court hearing that 

allows the judge and other parties to find out what is going on with the case.  

f  your  child  is  in  foster  care,  DCF-Family  Services  has  60  days  to  file  a  written 
Case Plan. Family members should be part of the planning process. The Case Plan 
lists the services that the social worker thinks will be good for you and your child. 
That plan should be available to you and your lawyer around the time of the Merits 
Hearing.  (The Merits Hearing should occur within 60 days from the date a child is 
removed from home.)  The judge may give you or someone else (such as a relative 
or  family  friend)  custody  of  your  child  with  certain  conditions.    This  is  called  a 
Conditional Custody Order. 

 

Back to Top 

4.   Merits Hearing 

  The  Merits  Hearing  should occur  within  60 days  from the date  of  a  temporary 
care order.  This may not always be possible if the court or parties need more 
time. 

  Your  lawyer  will  meet  with  you  before  the  hearing  to  listen  to  your  side  of  the 

story and talk with you about what will be presented in court. 

  Your  lawyer  will  talk  to  witnesses  (people  who  know  you  and  your  child),  and 
may have them come to the hearing to tell the judge what they know about you 
and your child. This is called “testifying.”

If  you  will  be  testifying,  your  lawyer  will  go  over  the  questions  you  will  be 
asked, and the questions that the State’s Attorney may ask you. 

  Your  lawyer  will  research  the  legal  parts  of  the  case,  and  look  over  the  DCF-

Family Services file and any important paperwork. 

  At the hearing, the State’s Attorney ("the State") must prove that your child is a 

“Child in Need of Care or Supervision” (CHINS). 

 

If  witnesses  testify  for  the  State,  your  lawyer  will  ask  them  questions  to 
challenge what they say. 

  Your  lawyer  may  have  witnesses  to  testify  for  you,  and  the  State  will 

question those witnesses.  

  After listening to all of the witnesses, the judge decides whether your child is in 

need of care or supervision (CHINS). 

If the judge decides that your child is not in need of care or supervision, the 
case is dismissed and your child returns home. 

If  the  judge  decides  that  your  child  is  in  need  of  care  or  supervision,  a 
Disposition Hearing will be held within 35 days. 

Back to Top 

5.   Before the Disposition Hearing 

The word ‘disposition’ means making a final arrangement. 

Before  the  Disposition  Hearing,  the  Family  Services  social  worker  prepares  a 
Disposition Case Plan. This means the social worker has made final arrangements 
or a final plan for your case. 

  The  purpose  of  the  Case  Plan  is  to  help  you  and  your  family  work  out  your 

problems.  

It  describes  your  child’s  needs  and  a  plan  of  “services.”  Counseling  is  an 
example of a service that might be recommended. 

If your child is in DCF custody, the Case Plan may require that your child remain 
in DCF custody for the time being 

  The plan may be for your child to return home when it is safe to do so. 

 

If your child is over 16 years of age and has been placed in DCF custody, the 
Case Plan should include services from the Agency of Education and agencies 
in the community.  

  Family Services must file the Disposition Case Plan with the court and make it 
available  to  your  lawyer  7  business  days  before  the  scheduled  disposition 
haering.

  The  Case  Plan  also  recommends  a  long-term  goal  for  your  child,  such  as 

returning home or living with someone else. 

  Your lawyer should discuss the Disposition Case Plan with you. If your lawyer 
does  not  contact  you  to  discuss  the  Plan,  call  him  or  her  before  the  hearing 
date. 

If everyone agrees to the Plan, the judge will likely approve it. 

If the Plan is not agreed to, there will be a contested Disposition Hearing. 

Back to Top 

.   Disposition Hearing 

  The Disposition Hearing should be held within 35 days after the Merits Hearing.  

If everyone agrees to the Case Plan, the judge will likely approve it. 

If the Case Plan is not agreed to, a contested Hearing is held. 

  You  and  your  lawyer  must  discuss  the  social  worker’s  and  the  court's  concerns 

about the safety and well-being of your child. 

  Your  lawyer  may  present  a  different  plan  to  the  court.  Your  lawyer  might  have 

witnesses testify for you at the hearing. 

  The judge will decide who will have legal custody of your child and what you, and 

possibly your child, must do. 

 

If your child is placed outside of your home to live, the judge will decide how often 
you can see your child. 

  The judge can order visits between your child and other people who are important 

to your child. 

  The judge will issue an Order based on the Disposition Case Plan that will guide how 
this matter is handled for the coming months and what the goal for your child should be. 

  You  need  to  work  with  DCF-Family  Services  and  follow  the  court’s  order  about 

addressing the issues in your family. 

  You might need to participate in counseling or take a class on how to better meet 

your child’s needs. 

 

If you do not follow the Order, it could take longer for your child to be returned to 
you, and you could even lose your rights to your child forever. 

   On a monthly basis after the Disposition Hearing, let your lawyer know how the Plan is 

working out for you. If the Plan is not working, your lawyer needs to know. 

  Your lawyer will tell you about your right to appeal the judge’s decision. This means that 
you can ask the  Vermont  Supreme  Court to review  the judge’s  decision  if you  do  not 
agree with it.

7.   Post-Disposition Review Hearing 

  This hearing is held 60 days after the Disposition Order. 
  At this hearing, the court checks the progress that you and your child are making. 
 

It is important that you talk to your lawyer before this hearing. 

.  Case Plan Review 

If your child is placed in DCF custody, a Case Plan Review will be held at the DCF 
office every 6 months.  

  DCF-Family Services will send you a letter inviting you to this meeting. Your social 

worker and others involved with the case will be there. 

  The plan for your family will be discussed. 
  The person in charge of the meeting will talk about:  

the goal for your family,  

• 
•  whether you and DCF-Family Services are doing what you are each supposed 

to do, and 

•  how your child is doing. 

  Changes to the Case Plan may be made. 
  You may challenge certain parts of the Case Plan. 
  Your lawyer may be present for this meeting, particularly if you do not agree with 

the Case Plan, or if DCF-Family Services is not following the Case Plan. 
  Since this is not a court hearing, your lawyer might not plan to attend. You must let 

your lawyer know of the date if you want to be represented at this Case Plan Review 
meeting.  

hen  the  Case  Plan  Review  happens  before  a  Permanency  Hearing,  decisions  may  be 
made that  will  be  presented to the  court at the  Permanency  Hearing.   It  is  important that 
your  lawyer  know  about  these  decisions  before  the  Permanency  Hearing  happens.    It  is 
important that you talk with your lawyer before each hearing.

.   Permanency Hearing 

If your child is in DCF custody, there will be a Permanency Hearing in court at least 
once a year. (These hearings can take place sooner if the child is under age 6.) 

  The purpose of this hearing is for the court to make sure that your child has, or will soon 

have, a permanent home. 

  About a month before this hearing, DCF will file an updated Case Plan, called a 
Permanency Plan. Your lawyer should talk with you about what the plan says.  

  DCF will present this Plan at the hearing. You have the right to disagree with the Plan. If 
you disagree with the Permanency Plan, the court can schedule a contested hearing. 
At this hearing, your lawyer may ask witnesses to testify on your behalf.

  The court will accept or reject the Permanency Plan. The judge will issue a 

Permanency Order. Your child could be placed in your home, or the court could 
consider another permanent home for your child. Examples of this are adoption or 
Permanent Guardianship.  

 

In making a decision, the judge will look at many things, including:   

  Whether you have done what you are supposed to do according to the Case Plan; 

  Whether DCF has made efforts to reach the permanency goal for your child. 

  The judge’s decision is guided by what is in your child’s best interest.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
