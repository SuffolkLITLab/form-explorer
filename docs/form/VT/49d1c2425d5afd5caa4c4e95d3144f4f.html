      <pre>What Does the Law Say? 

 

A  judge  can  only  issue  a  “no  stalking”  order  if 
you  prove  that  the  Defendant  “stalked”  you  OR 
sexually assaulted you.  It will be up to the judge 
to  decide whether the  facts  you describe  meet 
the requirements of the law. 

To  prove  “stalking” you  have  to  prove  that  the 
Defendant did ALL FOUR of these things: 
1.  The  Defendant  either  followed  you,  or 

“threatened”  you,  or  hid 
planning to attack you; AND 

somewhere               

2.  The Defendant had no  legitimate  reason  to 

do this; AND 

3.  The  Defendant  has  done  this  more  than 

once over a period of time; AND 

4.  What the Defendant did was serious enough 
to either cause an average person to fear for 
his  or  her    safety  OR  cause  an  average  per-
son substantial emotional distress.  

that 

think 

“Threatened”  you  means something that would 
make  an  average  person 
Defendant  was  going  to  sexually  assault  you, 
physically hurt you, or kidnap you.  Mean words 
or  insults  or  harassment  are  NOT  enough  to 
prove  threatening  behavior.  For  example,  a 
judge usually cannot issue an order just because 
someone  is  calling  you  names  or  posting  nasty 
things about you on Facebook. 

To prove a “sexual assault,” you must prove that 
the  Defendant  did  something  defined  in  the          
criminal laws as an illegal  sexual act. Under this 
law,  some  things  you  might  think  of  as  sexual            
assaults  (like  touching  a  woman’s  chest  without 
her consent) are not covered.

If the Judge  
Does Not Issue a  
“No Stalking” Order 

You  may  be  disappointed  if  the  judge 
does  not  issue  an  order.  It  is  the 
judge’s  job  to  decide  whether  what 
happened  meets  the  requirements  for 
an  order.  Remember  that  the  stalking 
law  is  to  protect  people  from  being 
physically  hurt,  sexually  assaulted,  or 
kidnapped.  The  stalking  law  does  not 
stop  people  from  being  rude  to  you, 
swearing  at  you,  yelling  at  you,        
criticizing you, or harassing you. 

Other Useful Information 

•  You  are  responsible  for  giving  the 

information

•  Contact the court to find out where 
the  Family  and  Civil  Divisions  are 
located  in  your  county  or  go  to 
http://www.vermontjudiciary.org. 
•  Any  statement  of  facts  you  write 
will  need  to  be  notarized,  so  you 
should  bring  proof  of  identification 
with  you  when  you  go  to  court  to 
file. 

The  hearing  is  not  based  just  on 
what  you  wrote  in  your  affidavit. 
You  will  have  to  testify.  You  may 
also  bring  other  people  to  testify 
about  what  happened.  If  the  De-
fendant  comes  to  the  hearing,  he 
or she also gets to testify and may 
bring  witnesses.  These  hearings 
are public. Then the judge will de-
cide  whether  the  evidence  meets 
the requirements for an order.  

f  the  judge  decides  there  is  not 
enough evidence for an order, the 
temporary  order  will  end  and  the 
case will be dismissed. 

f the judge issues an order, it will 
be  for  a  limited  period  of  time. 
You  and  the  Defendant  will  both 
get a copy of the order right after 
the  hearing  if  the  Defendant  is 
present.  If  the  Defendant  is  not 
present,  the  police  will  have  to  
deliver  a  copy  to  the  Defendant 
before the order is in effect.

To ask for a “no stalking” order you have to fill out 
some forms. One is called a “complaint” and  an-
other  is  called  an  “affidavit.”  The  affidavit  is 
where you explain what has happened that makes 
you  feel  you  need  a  court  order.  You  have  to 
swear that you are telling the truth when you sign 
it.  After  you  fill  in  these  forms,  a  judge  will  read 
them.  The  judge  will  decide  whether  your  facts

If the judge does NOT issue an emergency order: 
1.  You can still ask to have a hearing so that you 
can testify in court to try to prove your case. 
If  you  ask  for  a  hearing,  the  court  will  send 
your  complaint,  affidavit,  and  hearing  notice 
to the police so they can deliver a copy to the 
Defendant.  This

2. 

If the judge DOES issue an emergency order: 
1. 

It is only a temporary order. A hearing will be 
scheduled for a later date so that you and the 
Defendant  can  both  testify  in  court  and  tell 
your sides of the story. 

2.  The  court  will  deliver  a  copy  of  your          
complaint,  your  affidavit,  and  the  temporary 
order  to  the  police.  The  police  will  then     
deliver  these  to  the  Defendant.  This  is  called 
“serving” the Defendant.  

3.  UNTIL  THE  POLICE  SERVE  THE  PAPERWORK, 

THE  TEMPORARY  ORDER  IS  NOT  YET  IN

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
