      <pre>VERMONT FAMILY COURT MEDIATION PROGRAM 

Parent Coordination updated protocols July 2007 

CASE MANAGEMENT FLOW FOR PARENT COORDINATION 
(the process for high conflict parents) 

1.  Whether this is a newly filed or post judgment case; 
2.  If it is post judgment, and issue is parent child contact, the judge must 
indicate whether the scheduling changes should be consistent with the 
underlying order of parent-child contact in terms of percentage of time 
with each parent; 

3.  If the judge is requesting a modification in the percentage of time with 
each parent, the judge must indicate that it has been determined that 
the moving party has made a prima facie case of the issue of changed 
circumstances which would support a modification in the allocation of 
time; 

4.  The court should also specify other issues related to parent-child 
contact that it wishes the parent coordinator to address, i.e. 
transportation, exchanges, etc. 

. Judge or staff identifies a case as appropriate for Parent Coordination (a process that 

addresses parent child contact issues and parenting issues). 

ote: attorneys may not request a specific parent coordinator, but if the court would 
like to request a specific PC, please call the program director and explain. Sometimes 
the program will request that a specific PC by assigned to a case for purposes of 
supervision, etc. 

. Parent Coordination begins with an Order of Referral for Parent Coordination by a 

Family Court Judge following the filing of a motion.  

(cid:137)  NOTE:   The Court must establish Parental Rights and Responsibilities before ordering 

Parent Coordination (may be temporary PR&R). 

  NOTE:  Under a new provision in the rules, the judge must describe the “scope” of the 
parent coordination, i.e. what issues the parent coordinator should address.  The judge 
should address 

  N

 

  If the referral is made during a hearing or status conference, the Judge should advise 
parties that there is a fee for parent coordination, based on the Vermont Family Court 
Mediation Program’s sliding fee scale.  

(cid:137)  The parents receive the Order for Referral, a parent packet which contains relative 

information and forms, including the fee information and application  

(cid:137)  In the Order, the parents are directed to meet with the PC to learn more about the 

process.  

The Parent Coordinator is named in the Order. The parties are directed to 
contact the PC within 7 days of receipt of the order. When contacting the PC, the initial 
meeting is set up. If a parent does not contact the PC within 7 days (not counting the

weekend and allowing for the mail delay for the parent to receive the order from the 
court) the PC shall then send the Notice of Appointment form to the parent. 

If the parent does not respond to the Notice of Appointment, then the PC shall 

fill out the Interview Outcome Form. 

Initial meetings between the Parent Coordinator and the parties (the parents) 
are usually held at the courthouse and are always held separately. At this initial 
meeting the PC Reviews the parent’s Intake Questionnaire and determines if 
the parties can agree to participate in the process. If they agree to enter into 
the process, the PC assigns a case track (10 – 25 hrs) and sets the fee the 
parent shall pay in advance ($5hr- $80hr), the Parent Coordinator asks the 
parents to sign the Agreement to Enter Into Parent Coordination, parents also 
sign a release for information so that the PC may talk with individuals involved 
with the family. 

(cid:137)  Parties are notified that if during this process, they cannot agree on a parenting plan 

with the help of the Parent Coordinator, the Parent Coordinator shall submit a report to 
the court, including a narrative summary of the Parent Coordinator’s meetings with the 
parties and others and detailed recommendations for a parenting / parent-child contact 
plan.   

  After the parties understand the process and paperwork is complete, discussion then 

moves to the central issues affecting the conflict  

  At this meeting, each party is also required to pay in advance for 5 - 12.5 hours of the 

Parent Coordinator’s time based upon the sliding fee scale.  

(cid:137)  If both parents agree, the PC notifies the Court sending Interview Outcome Form that 
the case shall go forth into PC. The Order for Parent Coordination is sent to the Judge 
for signature.  

(cid:137)  At the initial meeting if the parties cannot agree to participate in the process of Parent 
Coordination, the Parent Coordinator sends Interview Outcome Form to the court 
noting that the process will not go forward, indicating which party refused the service. 

. What happens after the Order for Parent Coordination? 

  A status conference is ordinarily set at the time of the Order of Referral for Parent 

Coordination for 10– 12 weeks following the Order. This is to give the parents and PC 
a deadline in which to operate. 

(cid:137)  The Parent Coordinator meets with and has phone conferences with both parents; 

meets with the children; meets with or has phone conferences with professionals and 
other people who know the children well.   

(cid:137)  A visitation and communication plan addressing when, where and how contact will 

take place is drafted based upon these conferences. 
 

(cid:137)  The plan often undergoes several reviews and amendments over the course of the 
ten-week period before the first scheduled status conference and may also undergo 
several revisions after the initial ten- week period.

(cid:137)  The goal of the process is to produce either a signed stipulation, or a written 

recommendation from the Parent Coordinator near the end of the ten – twelve weeks.  

(cid:137)  If parents have stipulated, the Judge may choose to order the stipulation as a 
temporary order or final order with or without a status conference or hearing 

(cid:137)  The status conference should produce either a final or temporary order (if parties have 

signed a stipulation) or a temporary order based on the Parent Coordinator’s 
recommendations (if there are objections to the recommendation). It is imperative to 
have some type of order in effect, even if it is a temporary order. 

(cid:137)  If parties cannot agree on a parent-child contact/parenting plan, the Parent 

Coordinator shall submit a report to the Family Court, including a narrative summary of 
meetings with the parties and others and detailed recommendations for a parent-child 
contact/ parenting plan.  The report shall be filed with the Family Court and mailed to 
the parties at least 14 days prior to the date set for the status conference. The Court 
may schedule a hearing on any objections filed within 10 days. 

(cid:137)  A party who objects to the parent child contact plan proposed by the Parent 

Coordinator shall file their objections in writing with the Family Court within ten (10) 
days of the filing and mailing (postmark) of the Parent Coordinator’s report/ 
recommendations.  

(cid:137)  The court may schedule a hearing on any objections filed within the 10 days. 

(cid:137)  The Judge may generate a temporary order, which may be based upon the Parent 

Coordinator’s recommendations, which remains in effect until the hearing on 
objections. 

(cid:137)  The Judge may choose to adopt and order all or some of the parent coordinator’s 
recommendations if no objection is filed within 10 days, with or without a hearing.
