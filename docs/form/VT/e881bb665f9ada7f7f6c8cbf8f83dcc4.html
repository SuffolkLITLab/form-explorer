      <pre>VERMONT SUPREME COURT 
OFFICE OF THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATOR 
BOARD OF BAR EXAMINERS 

Note:  This is an unofficial version of the Rules of Admission.  Updated to reflect amendments 
approved in December 2016. 

Promulgated  Feb.  16, 2016 

Effective  April 18, 2016 

Rules  of Admission  to the Bar of the Vermont  Supreme 
Court 

Introductory  Board's 
Note 

The 2016  amendments  to the Rules of Admission  are comprehensive.   Existing rules 
have been reorganized  and renumbered,  some  rules have been combined,  and provisions 
of other  rules have been moved  to new locations.   Much  of the language of the  existing 
rules has been restyled.  The adoption  of the Uniform  Bar Examination required 
substantive  changes  to a number of  rules. 

Because  of the comprehensive  nature of the proposed  revision,  it is not possible to 

present the amendments  in a redlined version  that  highlights  changes  to the existing 
rules. These  Board's Notes attempt  to  identify the  relevant  prior  rules and to point  out 
where 
the new rules reflect  a significant  substantive  change  from the  prior rules. 

PART  I. GENERAL  PROVISIONS 

RULE  1.  PURPOSES OF RULES;  ESTABLISHMENT OF BOARD  AND 
COMMITTEE 

The public  interest  is best served  and protected  and the  integrity of the Bar of the 

Vermont  Supreme  Court  is best maintained when  applicants  for admission  are fairly, 
impartially,  and thoroughly  examined  as to their  professional  competence  as attorneys, 
and investigated  as to their  moral  character  and fitness.   The rules serve these  purposes. 
To assist  in achieving  these  results, the Court  has established  a board, known  as the 
Board of Bar Examiners,  which  is responsible  for examining  applicants' competence, and 
a committee,  known as the  Character  and  Fitness  Committee,  which  is responsible  for 
investigating applicants' moral  character  and fitness.

Board’s Notes 

The following  definitions  are drawn  from  prior rules: 

(a) "Actively Engage  in the Practice  of  Law'':  This definition is 
drawn  from  prior rule § 7(f).  The phrase "subsequent to admission" 
has been added  as a clarification that  is consistent with the  Board's 
longstanding  interpretation  of that rule. 

(d) "Approved Law School":  This definition  is drawn from prior 

rule § 6(h)(2).  The reference  to the American  Association  of Law 
Schools  was eliminated  as unnecessary.

(g) "Minimal  Professional  Competence":   This definition  is 

drawn from  prior rule § S(b). 

(n) "Week":  This definition  is based substantially  on prior rule 

§ 6(k). 

Other definitions are new. Most are consistent with past practice and have 
been added for clarity and to foster consistency, but some reflect the 
adoption of the Uniform Bar Examination. 

RULE  3.   BOARD  OF BAR  EXAMINERS 

(a)  Appointment;  Composition of Board;  Restriction  on Appointments;  Terms; 

Vacancy;  Officers;  Quorum. 

(1) Appointment.  The Court appoints the members of the Board. 

(2) Composition of Board.  The Board is comprised of 16 members: 

(A) Nine "Examiners": seven attorneys admitted to the Bar for at least three years 

before appointment, and two non-attorneys; and 

(B) Seven "Associate Examiners": attorneys admitted to the Bar for at least three 

years before appointment. Associate Examiners assist the Examiners in grading examinations 
and are not voting members of the Board. 

(3) Restriction on Appointments.  No trustee or faculty member of a law school or trustee 

of a university with a law school may serve as an Examiner or Associate Examiner. 

(4) Terms.  Terms commence on October 1.  Each term of appointment is for four years, 

plus any additional time necessary for appointment of a successor. No Examiner 
or Associate Examiner may be appointed for more than two consecutive, full terms, but: (A) an 
Examiner may be reappointed  after a lapse of one year; and (B) an Associate Examiner  may be 
appointed as an Examiner and then will be subject to the terms of appointment of an Examiner. 

(5) Vacancy.  If an Examiner or Associate Examiner resigns, or an appointment is otherwise 

vacant, the Court will appoint a successor to complete the unexpired term. 

(6) Officers, Appointment   of Chairperson   and Vice-Chairperson.   Annually,  for  terms 

commencing on October 1, the Court designates two Examiners to serve respectively as the 
Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the Board.  The Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson will serve in 
those capacities until their successors are designated.   In its discretion, the Court may reappoint  the 
Chairperson for a third consecutive, four-year 
term. 

(7) Quorum. A quorum  consists of five Examiners, or all Examiners not 

disqualified, whichever is less. 

(b) Duty  to Determine  Minimal  Professional  Competence.   It is the Examiners' duty to

Professional Competence in accordance  with these  rules warranting  the Applicant's 
admission  to the Bar to engage  in the  practice of law. 

(c) Annual  Report.   Annually,  the Board submits  a written  report  to the Court  that 
addresses  the  bar examination;  applications  for admission  and  persons  admitted  to the 
Bar; and relevant  policy matters  and rule changes  considered  or proposed  by the Board. 

(d) Compensation and  Expenses.   I n  t he  performance  of their  Board duties,  each 
Examiner  and Associate  Examiner  is eligible  to receive  per diem compensation and be 
reimbursed  for  reasonable  and necessary  expenses  equivalent  to that  provided  by law for 
comparable boards and commissions.   A request  for compensation and reimbursement must 
be made on a Court-approved voucher  and  be submitted  to the Court  Administrator. 

Board’s Notes 

This  rule is drawn  from  the  prior rules§§ 1, 2, and  5. 

The role of Associate  Examiners  has been  revised  because 
adoption  of the Uniform  Bar Examination will  change  grading 
practices  in some  respects.  The  rule clarifies  that  Associate 
Examiners  are not voting  members  of the Board.  Prior  rule § 1(b) 
required  a lapse of a full  term (four  years)  before  a former Examiner 
could  be reappointed  to the Board.  The  new rule shortens  that 
period  to  one year. 

RULE  4.  CHARACTER AND  FITNESS  COMMITTEE 

(a) Appointment; Composition of Committee;  Restriction  on Appointments; Terms; 

Vacancy;  Officers;  Quorum. 

(1) Appointment.  The Court appoints the Members of the Committee. 

(2) Composition of Committee.  The Committee  consists  of five Members: (A) 

Either  one retired  Supreme  Court  justice or an active  or retired  judge; (B) 

Two attorneys  admitted  to the Bar for at least three years  before 

appointment;  and 

(C)  Two  non-attorneys. 

(3) Restriction on Appointments.  No current  Examiner  or Associate  Examiner  of the 

Board  may  serve as a Member  of  the Committee. 

(4) Terms.  Terms  commence  on October  1.  Each term  of appointment  is for four 

years,  plus any additional  time necessary  for appointment  of a successor.

(5) Vacancy.  If  a  Member  resigns,  or an appointment is otherwise  vacant,  the 

Court  will appoint  a successor  to complete  the unexpired  term. 

(6) Officers. 

(A)Appointment of Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson.  The  Judge  Member will 

serve as Chairperson  of the  Committee.   Annually  on October  1, the Court will designate 
a Member  to serve as the Vice-Chairperson of the Committee.   The Chairperson  and Vice- 
Chairperson  will  serve  in such  capacities  until their  successors are designated. 

(B) Responsibilities of Chairperson.  The Chairperson  ensures  all reporting 

requirements  of the Committee  are completed  in accordance  with these  rules. 

(7) Quorum. A quorum  consists  of three Members  or all Members  not 

disqualified,  whichever  is less. 

(b) Duty  to Determine  Good  Moral  Character  and  Fitness.   It is the  Committee's duty 

to determine,  through  fair, impartial,  and thorough  investigation,  whether  an Applicant 
possesses  good  moral  character  and fitness  warranting  the  Applicant's admission  to the Bar 
to engage  in the  practice  of law. 

(c) Annual  Report. Annually, by  October  1  ,  the  Committee must  report  in  writing  to  the 
if  any,  relating  to  policies  or  procedures  for 

Court  its  activities    and  recommendations, 
investigating  Applicants' moral  character  and  fitness. 

(d) Compensation  and  Expenses.   In the  performance  of  their Committee  duties, each 
Member  is eligible  to receive  per diem compensation  and be reimbursed  for reasonable  and 
necessary  expenses  equivalent  to that  provided  by law for  comparable boards  and 
commissions.   A request  for compensation  and reimbursement  of expenses must  be made 
on a Court-approved  voucher  and  be submitted  to the Court  Administrator. 

Board's  Notes 

This rule is drawn  from the  prior rules §§ 3 and 5. 

The  description  of  the Committee's reporting  obligation  has 
been changed  to reflect  current  practice.  The  Committee  does not 
separately  report (as  prior  rule § 3 suggested)  a list of the applicants 
found  to possess  good  moral  character  and fitness. Rather,  the 
Committee  identifies  those  applicants  who qualify  for admission  
and those  applicants  are included  on the motion  for admission 
described  in Ru1e 20(b).

Minimal  Professional  Competence  either  by satisfying  the requirements  for  admission  by

without  examination. 

(c) Character  and  Fitness.  An Applicant  has the  burden of establishing  that the 

Applicant  possesses  good  moral  character  and fitness  warranting  the  Applicant's

Board's  Notes 

This rule is drawn  from the  prior rules §§ 5, 6(t),  and 11. 

The new rule clarifies  the general  requirements  for all 

Applicants.  The specific  requirements  for  admission  are detailed 
in Part  II (Admission  by Examination or Transferred UBE  Score); Part III 
(Admission  without  Examination),  and  Part  IV  (Character and  Fitness 
Review).

Board's  Notes 

This rule is drawn  from the  prior rules § 6. 

The new rule reflects  the adoption  of the Uniform  Bar 
Examination  and the provision  allowing  law students  to take 
the bar  exam  after  completing  five  semesters  of law school. 

RULE  7.  THE  LAW  OFFICE  STUDY  PROGRAM 

(a) Definition.   "Law  Office  Study  Program"  (or "LOS  Program")  means apprenticing  for 

the  prescribed  term  under  the supervision  of a judge or an attorney  who practices  in 
Vermont  and  has been admitted  to practice  before this Court  not less than  3 years  prior to 
the  Registrant's commencement   of  the  apprenticeship. 

(b) Requirements  for Study.   The  purpose  of the LOS Program  is to prepare  a 
Registrant  to engage  in the  general  practice  of law.  To ensure  this  purpose  is met: 

(I) a Registrant  must  carefully  arrange  with  the supervising  judge  or attorney  a 

systematic  course  of study  to prepare the Registrant  for the general  practice  of law, 
including,  but not limited  to, the subjects  tested on the Uniform  Bar Examination  and 
related  Vermont  law; and 

(2)  a  supervising  judge  or  attorney  may,  and  is encouraged to,  enlist  the  assistance of 
other  judges  and  attorneys to  provide  the  greatest breadth  of  experience  and  instruction  to 
the  Registrant. 

(c) Minimum  Education  Requirements  for an  LOS Program  Registrant.   Prior to 
enrollment  in the LOS Program,  a Registrant  must  have  earned  a bachelor's degree  from 
a college  or  university  within  the United  States  that  is authorized  to grant  a bachelor's 
degree  by the law of the state in which  it is located. 

(d) Measurement  of Study.   Study  under the supervision  of a judge or an attorney  is 

measured  as  follows: 

(1) A week of study consists of(A) not less than 25 hours of study during a period of7 

consecutive days, or (B) not less than 30 hours of study during a period of 14 consecutive 
days;  and 

(2) A year of study  consists  of 12 calendar  months  during  which  not less than  44 

weeks  of study  were  pursued. 

(e) Term  of Study;  Credit Awarded  Towards  Term.   The LOS Program  requires four 
years  of approved  study.   Subject  to Court  approval,  the Board has discretion  to award  a 
Registrant  partial  credit for up to 2 years towards  the 4-year  term  based on a 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 8 of 35 

Registrant's prior  legal  study,  if the  Registrant  demonstrates  to the  Board's  satisfaction 
that  the prior  study: 

(I) satisfies the purpose of the LOS Program; 

(2) is recent and not stale;  and 

(3) was  acquired: 

(A) from an  Approved  or non-Approved  Law  School,  whether or not the 

Applicant  has  graduated; 

(B) from a program  in another  U.S.  jurisdiction,  which  the Registrant  can 

demonstrate  is substantially  equivalent  to the LOS Program;  or 

(C) through the study of law in a foreign, common-law  jurisdiction  if the 

Applicant has been admitted to the practice of law before a court of general 
jurisdiction. 

(f) Reporting  Requirements.   The Registrant  is responsible  for satisfying  all 
reporting  requirements.   The Registrant  must comply  with all deadlines  and submit  all 
required  notices,  certificates,  and reports/affidavits to the Board  on Board-approved 
forms. 

(I)  Commencement Notice. The  Registrant must file the  commencement notice within 
30  days  after beginning the  LOS  Program  or  changing  offices  where  he  or  she  is pursuing 
the LOS Program.   The commencement  notice must include: 

(A) the date that study  began; 

(B) the  judge's or  attorney's representation  that  he  or  she  has  personally 
investigated  the moral  character  and fitness of the Registrant,  and, that  to the best of 
his or her knowledge,  the Registrant,  at the time of commencement,  meets  the 
requirements  of good  moral character  and fitness;  and 

(C) the supervising judge's or attorney's certification. 

(2) Six-Month  Report. 

(A) General  Requirements.   Each report  must be:

(ii)  describe in  detail  the  areas  of  study  pursued,  the  tasks performed, 
and  any  other  relevant study  or  work completed  during  the  reporting 
period;  and 

(iii) outline  the  Registrant's plan of study  for the next  reporting  period. (3) 

Completion Notice. Within  30 days of completing  the LOS Program, and 
together  with the required  six-month  report, the Registrant  must file with the Board  a 
signed  completion  notice. 

(4) Failure to Timely Report. Inthe  Board's discretion,  a Registrant's failure  to  timely 

file any  notice,  certificate,  or report  required  may result  in the withholding  of credit for 
study,  disqualification  to take the  bar examination,  and/or disqualification  to be admitted. 

(5) Extensions. For good  cause, the Board  may extend  by up to 60 days the  period to 

file any notice,  certificate,  or report. 

(6) Review of Six-Month Reports. An Examiner  will review the Registrant's 

report and may  forward  the report to the Board  for further  review.   The Registrant  may  be 
required  to  provide additional  information  to support  a report.   The Board  will  notify the 
Registrant  within  60 days whether  the  report has  been approved  for credit  or disapproved. 

(7) Deemed Approval. Commencement  notices,  six-month  reports, and completion 

notices that are timely  filed  will  be deemed  approved  unless the  Board notifies the  
Registrant  in writing within  60 days of submission  that the notice or report  is disapproved  or 
that further  review  is pending. 

Board's  Notes 

The rule  is drawn  from  the  prior rules §§ 6(g), (k), (m) and 8.

The requirements  of the Law  Office Study  Program  are now 

set forth  in a single  rule. The  new rule consistently  uses the 
terms  Law  Office  Study  or "LOS" as an  appropriate description 
of  the  program,  and the  term  "Registrant"to 
describe  participants  in the  program.  The  term "clerkship" is no 
longer  used  for this  program. 

While  formerly  a Registrant  was required  to have completed 

three-fourths  of the work  required  for a bachelor's degree, 
Registrants  are now  required  to have  a bachelor's degree. 
Registrants  already  in the program  do  not have to meet this new 
requirement,  although  the new rule will apply  if a current 
Registrant  leaves  and then  reapplies to the program. 
The  new  rule  also  directs Registrants  to  study  the  subjects 
tested on  the  Uniform  Bar  Examination,  as  well  as  related 
Vermont  law. 

Prior  rules § 6(I)  provided  the  Board had discretion  to "allow 
an applicant  partial credit  for study which  does not meet with the 
minimum  requirements  prescribed  by this section  as 
the Board  shall  deem  just  and equitable." Because  § 6 
addressed  several  types  of  prescribed  study,  and§ 6(j)  provided 
certain limited options for credit for the Law Office Study Program, 
the scope of§ 6(1) was not entirely clear. The provisions of new 
Rule 7(e) (drawn from§ 6(j)) set forth the recognized bases for 
granting credit toward the four-year term for the Law Office Study 
Program. The requirement that the study be recent and not stale  
is new, but reflects consistent Board practice in considering 
requests for credit under § 6(j). The catch-all provision of§ 6(1) is 
not included in the new rule. 

RULE  8.  GRADUATE  OF A NON-APPROVED LAW  SCHOOL 

(a) Within  the United  States.   An Applicant  who has graduated  from a non•Approved 
Law  School  within  the United  States must satisfy the following  requirements no later  than 
the deadline  for applying  to take the Uniform  Bar Examination in Vermont: 

(I) demonstrate  that  the school  attended  was  in the  process  of seeking accreditation 

by the  American  Bar Association  during  the Applicant's attendance  and  has not since  been 
denied  accreditation;  and 

(2)  file an official  transcript  from the non-Approved  Law  School. 

(b) Outside  of the United  States.   An Applicant  who has graduated  from  a foreign, non- 

Approved  Law  School  ("Foreign  Law School")  must establish  he or she has: 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 11 of 35 

(1) completed a legal education equivalent to graduation from an Approved Law 

School, as determined by the equivalency determination  process; and 

(2) been admitted to the bar of a court of general jurisdiction in the country in which the 

Applicant attended the Foreign Law School and has maintained good standing in that bar or 
resigned from that bar while still in good standing.  The Board may waive this requirement for good 
cause. 

(c) Equivalency  Determination  Process. 

(1) Contents  of Equivalency  Determination  Application.   An application for 

equivalency  determination  must include: 

(A) the Applicant's official transcript from the Foreign Law School; 

(B) the Foreign Law School's course catalogue; and 

(C) any other information  required by the Board. 

(2) Deadlines. 

(A) To sit for the July Examination,  the application for equivalency 
determination must be submitted no later than the preceding December  1. 

(B) To sit for the February Examination, the application for equivalency 

determination must be submitted no later than the preceding August 1. 

(C) An application for equivalency  determination  may also be submitted together 

with an application for admission  by transferred  UBE score. 

(3) Written  Report.  To assist in determining the equivalency of an Applicant's course of 
study to the standards of an Approved Law School, the Board may retain an expert to prepare a 
written report ("Report''), which will assess: 

(A) whether the Foreign Law School's curriculum  provides training in a  system 

based on the common law of England; 

(B) whether the Foreign Law School is accredited or in the process of obtaining 

accreditation; 

(C) whether the Applicant has studied at least half of the subjects of 

examination tested on the UBE; 

(D) the Applicant's transcript and the Foreign Law School's grading system; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 12 of 35 

(E) whether  the  Foreign  Law  School's graduates  are regularly  admitted  to  the 

practice  of  law;  and 

(F) any other  factors  that may  be relevant  to determining  whether  the 

Applicant  has completed  a legal education  that  is equivalent  to that of an Approved 
Law  School. 

(4) Additional  Information.   Upon  completion: 

(A) the Report  will be provided  to the Board and the Applicant;  and 

(B) the  Applicant  may  provide  or the Board may  request further  information. (5) 

Costs.   The Applicant  is responsible  for all costs  associated  with an 

equivalency  determination.   The Applicant  must  make  a deposit  to the Board  before the 
Equivalency  Determination  commences. 

(6)  Result  of  Equivalency  Determination. The  Board  will  determine  whether  the 
Applicant  has established  that the  Foreign  Law  School  is equivalent  to an Approved  Law 
School. 

(7)  Waiver  of Report.   If the Board,  in its discretion,  determines  it already  has 

sufficient  information  to  recommend  approval  of a Foreign  Law  School,  it may waive the 
Report  requirement. 

(8) Extension.   If a final  determination  on an  Equivalency  Determination 
Application  has not been made  before the administration  of the Examination  for which 
the  application  was submitted,  it will  remain  pending  for the subsequent  Examination 
administration. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board's Notes 

This rule is drawn  from  the  prior rules § 6(h). 

The language  regarding  schools  in the  process of seeking 
accreditation  has been revised  slightly  for clarity.  A new  
provision  allows  the Board to waive, for good cause, the 
requirement  that an Applicant  who  is a graduate  of a foreign  law 
school  be admitted  to practice  in that jurisdiction.  This new 
provision  is consistent  with  the Board's practice,  in exceptional 
cases, of  recommending  that the Court  waive that requirement 
for some  Applicants.   New  language  has also  been added  to  
allow  an Applicant  seeking  admission  by transferred  UBE  score  
to request an equivalency  determination.  The provision  for 
waiver  of the usual equivalency  report  has been simplified  to 
afford the  Board discretion  where the Board  has sufficient 
information  to 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 13 of 35 

recommend  approval  of a Foreign  Law  School.  Finally, the new 
rule provides  for the Board  to make a final decision,  rather than a 
recommendation  to the  Supreme  Court.  The Board's decision  may 
be appealed  to the Supreme  Court  as permitted  by Rule  25. 

RULE  9.  ADMISSION BY  EXAMINATION 

(a) Administration of the UBE.   The Uniform  Bar Examination  is administered  twice each 

year, in February  and in July, on dates  designated  by the NCBE.   The Board  may administer 
the UBE  in Vermont  or, in its discretion,  may cooperate  with  a  neighboring state that  has 
adopted  the UBE to jointly  administer  the examination, so long  as the examination  is offered 
at a location  reasonably  convenient  to Vermont. 

(b) Examination  Requirements  and Passing  Score. 

(1) Within Five Years.  Except  where an Applicant  is already  licensed to practice law in 
another  U.S. jurisdiction,  an Applicant  must  sit for the UBE within  f i v e  years of graduating 
from law school  or completing  the LOS  Program.   An Applicant  seeking  to sit for the UBE 
beyond the  required  five-year  time period must obtain  Board  approval. 

(2) Sitting for Entire Examination.  An Applicant  must sit for all parts of the UBE 

at a single  administration  of the  Exam. 

(3) Passing Score.  To pass the UBE for admission  to the Vermont  Bar, an 

Applicant  must  attain  a score  of 270. 

(4) Limitation on Continued Sittings. An Applicant  who has failed the bar examination 

four times will not be permitted  to sit for the UBE in Vermont.  For purposes of this  rule, 
attempts  to achieve  a passing  score on the UBE count  toward  the limit of four regardless  of 
where the  Applicant  sat  for the UBE. 

(c) Application  Process.   To be eligible  to take  the Uniform  Bar Examination,  an 
Applicant  must  file an Application  with the  Board.   It is the Applicant's burden  of proof to 
establish  compliance  with the Application  process. 

(I) Application Contents. Each Application  must: 

(A) be on the  appropriate  Board-approved forms; 

(B) include the Applicant's NCBE number; and 

(C) include  a signed  authorization  and  release form. 

(2) Deadlines for Filing. An Application  must be received  on or before the 

applicable  deadline. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 14 of 35 

(A) July Examination:  Application  must  be received  by the preceding  May 1. 

(B) February  Examination:  Application  must  be received  by the  preceding 
December  1. 

(3) Late-Filed  Application.   A late-filed  Application  must be accompanied  by an 

official  law school  transcript  and a written  request to the Board  seeking  permission  for the 
late filing.   The Applicant  must demonstrate  extraordinary circumstances  to justify the  late 
filing.   The Board  has discretion  to accept  or deny a late-filed  petition. 

(4) Proving  Fulfillment  of Education  Requirements.   Before taking  the Uniform Bar 

Examination,  the Applicant  must  prove  fulfillment  of the education  requirements. The NCBE 
verification  will suffice to demonstrate  graduation  from  law school,  but the Board has the 
discretion  to request  an official  law school  transcript  to ensure  compliance. 

(5) Early  Examination.   An Applicant  studying  at an Approved  Law School  may apply 
to take the UBE before  graduation.  The Applicant  must successfully  complete  the equivalent 
of five semesters  of full-time  study  prior to taking  the UBE and  must submit an official  law 
school  transcript  documenting  that study  before sitting  for  the examination. To qualify for 
admission,  the Applicant  must  graduate  from an Approved Law  School  within  six  months 
after sitting  for the UBE.  The Applicant  must also satisfy all other requirements  for 
admission. 

(6) Continuing  Application.   An Application  is considered  a continuing application, 

meaning  the Applicant  has a duty to supplement  all information  provided  to the Board  up to 
and including  the date  of admission  to the Bar. 

(7) Refiling  Application.   An Application  must  be refiled  if an Applicant: (A) 

does not sit for the examination  as previously  permitted; 

(B) does  not  achieve  a score  of 270 or  higher  on the  UBE; 

(C) withdraws  the Application;  or 

(D) is denied  admission. 

(d) Notifying  Applicants.   The Board  will send an informational  letter  to each 

Applicant,  which  will include  at least  the following: 

(1) The dates, times,  and  locations  for the UBE; 

(2) An anonymous  identification  number  to be used on all examination 

(3) An admission  ticket to be used for admission  to the UBE; 

    

materials;

(4) The rules and procedures  for the administration  of the UBE; and 

(5) The procedure  for reporting  of scores. 

For the February  Examination,  the  informational  letter will  be sent  before  February  1. For the 
July Examination,  the  informational  letter will  be sent  before July  1. 

(e) Identifying  Applicants.   At the  examination  site, Applicants  are required  to present 

government-issued photo-identification.   Applicants  may  also  be required  to  have their 
fingerprints  taken  for  identification  purposes. 

(f) Deadline  to Request  Reasonable  Accommodations.   A request for  reasonable 
accommodations for the UBE  must  be filed  no later than the  Application  deadline,  except 
upon a showing  of extraordinary  circumstances. 

Board’s Notes – 2016 Amendment 

An  amendment  of  Rule  9(b)(1),  effective  December  5,  2016, 
extends  from  three  years  to  five  years  the  time  within  which  an 
applicant  must  sit  for  the  bar  exam  after  graduating  law  school  or 
completing the LOS  program. 

Board's  Notes 

Elements  of Rule  9 are drawn  from the prior rules §§ 8, 9, and 

10, but much of the rule is new, and reflects the adoption  of the 
Uniform  Bar  Examination. 

Consistent  with the adoption  of the UBE, the  rule provides  the 

Board discretion  to coordinate  administration  of the exam  with 
neighboring  jurisdictions,  so long as the exam  is administered  at a 
site that  is reasonably  convenient  to Vermont.  For example,  the 
Board  may explore  jointly  administering  the exam  with New 
Hampshire  at a central  location. 

The rule  includes  a new  provision  that an Applicant  must sit for 

the bar examination  within three years of graduating  from  law 
school  or completing  the law office study  program,  unless the 
applicant  is licensed  to  practice  law  in another  jurisdiction. 

Another  new  provision  allows  law students  to sit for the 
examination   after  completing  five  semesters  of  law school,  which 
for most  students  in full-time  programs  would  be in February  of the 
third year. To qualify  for admission  under this  provision,  an 
Applicant  must  graduate  within  six months  of sitting  for the exam. 

Consistent  with the  prior  rules§ 10(k),  Applicants  may  not  sit for 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 16 of 35 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the examination  more  than four times.  Rule  9 (and Rule  13) apply the 
same limit  to UBE attempts  in any jurisdiction.  The new rules 
eliminate  the option  of applying  to the Board  for  permission, on a 
showing  of good  cause, to sit for the exam  a fifth time.  The former 
provision  cannot be administered  uniformly  with  respect to 

other UBE  jurisdictions,  because the Board  cannot  control  who sits for 
the examination  in those  jurisdictions. 

Other  provisions  address  administrative  requirements,  either 
reflecting  current  practice,  such  as  requiring  identification  at  the 
exam, or reflecting  changes  associated  with the UBE. 

RULE  10.   GRADING OF  THE UNIFORM BAR  EXAMINATION; FINALITY OF  SCORES 

(a) Multistate  Essay    Examination  and  Multistate  Performance  Tests.      The  Board 

grades  and assigns  raw scores to the Multistate  Essay  Examination  and the Multistate 
Performance  Tests. In its sole discretion,  the Board  may use professional  assistants  to assist 
with  grading.  The NCBE  scales  the raw scores on the MEE and MPT  to the MBE to calculate  a 
written  scaled  score for  each Applicant.  The MEE  is weighted  30%, the MPT  is weighted  20%, 
and  the  MBE  is weighted  50%  in calculating  an Applicant's UBE score. 

(b) Multistate Bar  Examination.  The NCBE  scores the MBE. 

(c) Certified Uniform Bar  Examination Score.  The NCBE  certifies  each 

Applicant's score on the UBE. 

(d) Finality of Scores.  An Applicant's score on the UBE, as certified by the NCBE, is 

final. 

Board's Notes 

This rule is new and reflects  the  adoption  of the Uniform  Bar 
Examination.  Consistent  with the standards  for the UBE, the rule 
provides  that  certified  UBE  scores are final.  A UBE jurisdiction may 
not offer the  review  and appeal  process set forth  in the  prior 
rules§§  l0(f), (g), (h).  Those  provisions  have  accordingly  been 
eliminated. 

RULE   11.   MULTISTATE  PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY  EXAMINATION 

An Applicant  for admission  by examination  must  achieve  a scaled  score  of 80 on the 

MPRE within  a period  beginning  three  years  before  initially  sitting  for the Uniform  Bar 
Examination  and concluding  one  year  after  written  notification  to the  Applicant  of achieving 
a Uniform  Bar  Examination  score that  meets  Vermont's passing  score requirement.   The 
Applicant  is responsible  for ensuring  that the Board receives  an official report from the NCBE 
certifying  the  Applicant's score  and the  MPRE  administration  date at which  the  score  was 
achieved. 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 17 of 35 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Board's  Notes 

Rule  11 is derived from  prior rule § 6. 

The required  score of 80 remains the same.  The temporal 
window  in which  the MPRE  must  be taken  is now  based on the 
date the Applicant  achieved  a passing  score on the Uniform  
Bar  Examination. 

RULE  12.   ADDITIONAL CLE  AND  EXPERIENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICANTS 
QUALIFYING  FOR  ADMISSION  BY  EXAMINATION 

(a) Requirements.   An Applicant  who qualifies  for  admission  by examination  must 

satisfy the  following  requirements. 

(1) Continuing  Legal Education  (CLE).   The Applicant  must attend  at least  15 hours 

of CLE on Vermont  practice  and procedure  in courses  approved  by the Board  of 
Continuing  Legal Education  and certified  by the Board  of Bar Examiners  as satisfying the 
requirements  of this  rule. A minimum  of 6 of the 15 CLE hours  must be earned  by 
attendance  at live courses.  All CLE courses  that satisfy this  requirement  must  be 
completed  no  earlier  than  6  months  before  the  Applicant  sits  for  the  bar  exam and  no  later 
than  1 year after the Applicant  is admitted  to the Vermont  Bar. For good cause, the Board may 
extend  the time necessary  to satisfy this CLE  requirement. 

(2) Mentorship.   Once the Applicant  is admitted  to the Vermont  Bar, the 

Applicant  must complete  a mentorship  under  the supervision  of a judge or attorney 
practicing  in Vermont.  The supervising  judge or attorney  must be admitted  to the 
Vermont Bar for at least  3 years when the mentorship  begins. The mentorship  must last at least 
6 months  and all requirements  must be completed  within one year of the Applicant's admission 
to the Vermont  Bar. To complete  the mentorship,  the Applicant  must: 

(A) meet regularly  with the supervising  judge or attorney,  no less than 10 times, 

to  discuss  the Applicant's practice  and  issues  relevant  to  Vermont  practice  and 
procedure;  and 

(B) engage  in at least 40 hours of activities  on the  mentorship  program  list 

compiled  by the Board  of Continuing  Legal Education  and certified  by the Board  of Bar 
Examiners  as satisfying the requirements  of this  Rule. 

(b) Reporting.   The Applicant  and supervising  judge or attorney  must  certify completion 

of the  requirements  of Rule 12(a) within  one year  of the date of admission,  or the 
Applicant's license  will  be  suspended.

Board's  Notes 

Together  with the adoption  of the Uniform  Bar Exam,  new Rule 12 
eliminates  the  former  three-month  clerkship  requirement and 
replaces  it with a Continuing  Legal  Education  (CLE)  program and a 
post-admission  mentorship  program.  The CLE  requirement is similar 
to that  already  required  of lawyers waiving  into  Vermont from  other 
states. The  purpose  of the CLE  program  is to educate bar applicants 
and new lawyers  about  some  unique  features  of Vermont  law and to 
acclimate  new lawyers  to the  Vermont  legal community.  The 
required  CLE must  be completed  no later than one year  after 
admission  to the  Vermont  Bar. 

The mentorship  program  requires  a newly  licensed  lawyer  to  be 
mentored  in the first  year of  practice  by a judge  or experienced 
attorney  practicing  law in Vermont.  The program  will help new 
lawyers  become  acclimated  to the  practice  of law in Vermont  and the 
Vermont  legal community.  The mentors  will  provide  guidance to new 
lawyers  as they  begin their  practice.  The mentorship program requires 
personal  contact  between the mentor  and the new lawyer to foster  a 
personal  connection  that will  continue  beyond the formal  program 
requirements.  The mentorship  program  also requires the new lawyer 
to perform  certain  legal tasks or attend certain legal  functions  to gain 
exposure  to  proceedings, institutions, and  organizations,  as well  as to 
observe  experienced attorneys  performing  tasks that  may  be relevant 
to the  new attorney's practice.  The  Board  of Continuing  Legal 
Education  and Board of Bar Examiners  will approve, and periodically 
revise,  a recommended activities  list for the mentorship  program.  The 
list affords  substantial  flexibility  for new  lawyers  and their mentors  to 
develop  an individualized  program  that  assures  broad and relevant 
exposure  to Vermont  law, legal practice,  and the legal culture. 

The mentorship  program  must  be completed  within one year of 
admission  to the Vermont  Bar. The new program  continues  a valuable 
aspect  of the former  three-month  clerkship  by 
encouraging  new attorneys  to form  mentoring  relationships  with 
experienced   practitioners. 

 

 

 

 

 

RULE  13.   ADMISSION BY TRANSFERRED UNIFORM  BAR  EXAMINATION SCORE 

(a) General  Requirements.   To be admitted  by transferred  UBE score earned  in another 

U.S.  jurisdiction,  the  Applicant  must file an Application  on forms required  by the Board,  pay 
the  required  fee, and  arrange  for the  NCBE  to transfer  the  Applicant's UBE score  to Vermont. 
The following  additional  requirements  must  be met. 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 19 of 35 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Age  of Score.   The Applicant  must have earned  a UBE  score of 270 or higher 

either: 

(1) in an administration  of the  UBE which  occurred  within  3 years before the  date on 

which  the application  for admission  by transferred  UBE score  was filed; or 

(2) in an administration  of the  UBE which  occurred  more than 3 years but less than  5 
years  before the  date of filing  of the application  for admission  by transferred  UBE score, and 
been Actively  Engaged  in the Practice  of Law for at least 2 years  in another U.S.  jurisdiction  
in which  the applicant  was a member  in good  standing. 

(c) Attempts.  The  required  score  must  have been achieved  within  no more than4 
sittings  for the UBE.  For  purposes  of this  rule, attempts  to achieve  the required  score 
count  toward  the limit of 4 regardless  of where the Applicant  sat for the UBE. 

(d) Timing  of UBE.   The  required  score  must have  been  achieved  at an 

administration  of the UBE no later than  3 years after  the Applicant  completed  the 
educational  requirements  set forth in Ru1e 6. 

(e) MPRE.   The Applicant  must  have  achieved  a scaled  score  of 80 or  higher on the 
MPRE  taken within  3 years of the date on which  the application  for admission  by transferred 
UBE  score  was filed. 

(f) Educational  Requirement.   The Applicant  must meet  the educational 

requirements  set forth in Ru1e 6. 

(g) Additional  CLE and  Experiential  Requirements.   The Applicant  must  satisfy the 

requirements  set forth  in Ru1e 12. 

Board's  Notes 

This ru1e is new and establishes  the process for admission  by 
transferred  UBE  score.  An Applicant  may transfer  a UBE  score for 
three years, or up to  five years  if the Applicant  has been  practicing 
law in another  U.S. jurisdiction  for at least two years.  After  five years, 
the score  is too stale and an  Applicant  must qualify  for admission 
without  examination  under Ru1e 14 or retake the exam. 

Generally,  Applicants  for admission  by transferred  UBE  score 
must  meet the  requirements  for admission  by examination.  The 
rule  restates  or  cross-references those  requirements,  as  appropriate. 
The ru1e does not  restate the  requirements  of Ru1e  5, because  Ru1e 
5 expressly  applies  to all Applicants.

PART  M . ADMISSION  WITHOUT EXAMINATION 

RULE  14.  NECESSARY  SHOWING   FOR ADMISSION WITHOUT EXAMINATION; 
RESTRICTION ON  ELIGIBILITY 

An Attorney-Applicant may seek  admission  to the  Bar without  examination  by 

submitting an Application  on forms  required  by the Board  and paying the  required  fee.   An 
Application  may  be filed  at any  time.   An Attorney-Applicant is not eligible  to seek admission 
under this rule  if he or she has failed the  Vermont  Bar Examination  within  the preceding  5 
years  or failed  to earn a score of 270 or  higher  on the Uniform  Bar Examination  taken  in 
Vermont  or another UBE jurisdiction  within  the preceding 5 years. 

Board's  Notes 

Rule  14 is derived  from the  prior rules § 7(a),  (e)(4). 

Rule 14 introduces the process for applying for admission 
without examination. For purposes of these rules, admission 
without examination does not include admission by transferred 
UBE score. Admission without examination is available to certain 
attorneys who are admitted and have practiced the requisite 
period of time in another U.S. jurisdiction.  Applicants seeking 
admission under this rule are called "Attorney-Applicants." 
Consistent with the prior rules § 7(e)(4), admission without 
examination is not available to Applicants who have failed the 
Vermont bar examination in the past five years. The new rule 
extends the same prohibition to Applicants who have taken the 
UBE and failed to achieve Vermont's required score within the 
past five years. 

RULE  15.   REQUIREMENTS FOR  ATTORNEY-APPLICANTS 

An Attorney-Applicant must  meet  all the  following  requirements. 

(a) Practice  of Law.   The Attorney-Applicant must  have  been Actively  Engaged  in the 

Practice  of Law for  5 of the preceding  10 years  in one  or more  U.S. jurisdictions. 

(1) Waiver. Part of the 5-year  requirement  may be waived  if: 

(A) any jurisdiction  in which  the Attorney-Applicant is currently  licensed  and in 
which  he or she has been Actively  Engaged  in the Practice  of Law  for not less than six 
months  requires fewer  than 5 years'  admission  as a condition  of admission  on motion  and 
without  examination  for attorneys  licensed  in that jurisdiction;  and 

(B) the  Attorney-Applicant has  been  Actively  Engaged  in the Practice  of Law for 

not less than 3 of the  preceding  10 years.

(2) Waiver  for Maine  and New Hampshire.   The 5-year  requirement  may  be waived if 
the  Attorney-Applicant is currently  licensed  to  practice  law  in Maine  or New Hampshire  and 
has been Actively  Engaged  in the Practice  of Law  in Maine  or New Hampshire  for  not less than 
3 years  immediately  preceding  filing an Application  for admission  under this rule.   This 
provision  of the  rule shall  remain  in effect  only so long as the  equivalent  Maine  or New 
Hampshire  rule  remains  effective. 

(b) Current  Licensing  and Status.   The Attorney-Applicant must  be currently licensed  to 
practice  in at least one U.S.  jurisdiction;  not under suspension  or revocation  in any jurisdiction 
for disciplinary  reasons; and be a member  in good standing  in all jurisdictions  in which the 
Attorney-Applicant practices  law. 

(c) Continuing  Legal  Education  (CLE)  Requirement.   An Attorney-Applicant must attend 

at least  15 hours of CLE on  Vermont  practice  and procedure  in courses approved  by the 
Board of Continuing  Legal Education  and certified  by the Board  of Bar Examiners  as satisfying 
the requirements  of this rule.   A minimum  of 6 of the 15 CLE hours must  be earned  by 
attendance  at live courses.   The  Attorney-Applicant must satisfy this  requirement  within  one 
year  before or one year  after admission  to the Vermont  Bar. The  Applicant  must timely  
certify  satisfaction  of this requirement  or the Applicant's license  will  be suspended.   For  
good  cause, the Board  may extend  the time necessary  to satisfy this CLE  requirement. 

Board's  Notes 

Ru1e 15 is derived  from the  prior rules§  7. 

The  requirements   for  Attorney-Applicants are  substantively 
unchanged.  The new rule extends the time period  during which 
an Attorney-Applicant must  complete  the required  CLE.  The  new 
rule for  Attorney-Applicants, consistent  with the  new CLE 
requirement for newly  licensed  lawyers  under Ru1e 12, allows  for 
the  required CLE to be completed  up to one year  after admission 
to the  bar. The approved  live courses  are offered  at limited  times. 
The new rule allows  additional  flexibility  while  ensuring  that the 
CLE  program 
is timely  completed. 

PART  IV. CHARACTER  AND  FITNESS  REVIEW RULE 

16.   INVESTIGATION  GENERALLY 

(a) Duty  to Investigate.   The Committee  investigates  each  applicant  to determine 
whether  the applicant  possesses  good  moral character  and fitness.  An Applicant  who does 
not possess  good moral character  and fitness will  not  be recommended  for admission  to the 
Bar.

(b) Definitions and Purpose. 

(1) Good  Moral  Character.   Good  moral character  is a functional  assessment  of 
character  fitness of a prospective  attorney.  The purpose  of requiring  an applicant  to possess 
present  good moral  character  is to exclude  from the  practice  of law those  persons whose 
prior conduct  reasonably  demonstrates  a likelihood  to pose a risk to clients,  the legal system, 
or the administration  of justice.  This prior conduct  usually  involves  either dishonesty  or lack 
of trustworthiness in carrying  out  responsibilities.  There  may  be other conduct  that  is 
relevant  in the admission  process,  but it must  have a rational  connection with the applicant's 
present  fitness or capacity  to practice  law  and accordingly  must  relate to the state's 
legitimate  interests  in protecting  prospective  clients and the system  of 
justice. 

(2) Fitness.  Fitness  is the effect,  if any, of any health  condition  that  presently 
manifests  in conduct  by the Applicant  that is likely to pose a substantial  risk of harm to the 
public or the  legal system.  The purpose  of requiring  fitness  is to exclude  from the practice 
of law any  person  who  is not  presently  fit to practice  law.   Prior  conditions  are relevant 
only so far as they  reasonably  demonstrate  a present  lack of fitness. 

(c) Burden of Proof.  The Applicant  bears the  burden of proof  of establishing  good 

moral  character  and fitness. 

(d) Investigation-General. 

(1) Consent  and Waiver.   An Applicant  must consent  to an investigation  of his or 
her moral  character  and fitness  and  must  provide  all necessary  waivers  of confidentiality and 
liability  to facilitate  the  investigation. 

(2) References.   An Applicant  must provide as references  the  names and 

addresses  of three  persons  not related to the Applicant  by blood, marriage  or civil  union. In 
addition,  an Applicant  who, at the time of application  for admission,  has practiced  law in 
another U.S.  jurisdiction  for at least one  year must  provide as further  references  the names 
and addresses  of two attorneys  admitted  to practice  in that jurisdiction. 

(3) Appointment  of Member.   The Committee  will assign a single  Member  to 

conduct  the  investigation  of an Applicant's moral  character  and fitness. 

(e) Member's Report of lnvestigation.  After  concluding  an  investigation,  a Member must 

decide  whether  to certify the Applicant's good  moral  character  and fitness. The  Member 
must  report  the decision  in writing. 

(1) If the  Member  certifies  the  Applicant's good  moral  character  and  fitness,  the 
Committee need  not  conduct  further  review  and the  Committee  will  recommend  to the 
Court  the  Applicant's admission, provided  the  Applicant  has  satisfied  all  other  admission 
requirements.

Page 23 of 35 

(2) If the  Member  does  not  certify  the  Applicant's good  moral  character  and fitness, 
the Member  must  state the reasons  therefore  in his or  her report  to the  Committee and the 
Committee  will convene  a hearing  on the  Applicant's application  for  admission. 

Board's  Notes 

This rule is derived  from  portions  of the prior rules § 11. Minor 
changes  from  prior  rules § 11 reflect  the Committee's current 
practice. 

RULE  17.  HEARING  PROCESS 

A hearing  convened  pursuant  to Rule 16(e)(2)  will  be conducted  as follows: 

(a) Panel.   The hearing  will be before a 3-Member  panel of the Committee.  The Member 

who decided  not to certify  the Applicant's good  moral  character  must  not serve on the 
panel. At the commencement of the hearing,  one panel  Member  will  be designated as the 
presiding  Member. 

(b) Applicant's  Participation.    The Committee  must provide  the Applicant  with 
written  notice of the  hearing.  The Applicant  may appear  and present  information  to 
substantiate  good  moral  character  and fitness. 

(c) Counsel.  The Applicant  is entitled  to be represented  by counsel  at the  hearing. The 
panel  may  appoint  counsel  to  present  evidence  of  the  Applicant's  moral  character  and 
fitness. 

(d) Rules  of Evidence;  Subpoena  Power. 

(1) The rules of evidence  apply,  but evidence  not admissible  thereunder  may be 

admitted  if it is of a type commonly  relied  upon  by reasonably  prudent  persons  in the 
conduct  of their  affairs  and not precluded  by statute  or privilege. 

(2) The Committee  may  issue subpoenas  or compel  testimony.   All testimony 

must  be under oath administered  by the  presiding  Member  of the panel. 

(e) Hearing  Closed.   Unless the Applicant  requests  otherwise,  the  hearing  will  be closed 

except  to Members,  agents  of the Committee,  the Applicant,  and the  Applicant's counsel 
and  witnesses. 

(f) Recording  of  Hearing.  A  record  will  be  made  of  the  hearing. If  the  panel  does  not 
certify  an  Applicant's good  moral  character  and  fitness,  it must  produce  a transcript of  the 
applicable  hearing  at its expense.

(g)  Expansion  of  Record.  If, after  the  hearing,  the  panel  seeks  to  expand  the  record  to 
consider additional evidence, it may do so  after providing notice  and  an opportunity to be heard 
to all parties. 

Board's  Notes 

This rule is derived from portions of the prior rules § II. Minor 
changes from prior rules§ II  reflect the Committee's current 
practice. 

RULE 18.  PANEL'S  DECISION  AFTER HEARING 

(a) Decision.   After the conclusion  of the hearing,  or the time necessary  to expand  the 

record, the  panel will prepare  a written  decision  setting  forth  its findings,  conclusions,  
and  recommendations  on  whether  to certify  the Applicant's good  moral  character  and 
fitness. 

(b) Parties  Served.   The panel  must serve  its decision  on the Applicant  and Applicant's 
counsel,  and file a copy  with the Supreme  Court.   The decision  must inform the  Applicant  of 
the  right to appeal. 

(c) Right  to Appeal;  Supreme  Court's  Review.   The Applicant  has the right to appeal the 
decision  to the  Supreme  Court.  The Applicant's notice of appeal  must  be filed within  30 days 
of the date the decision  was mailed.   Within  30 days of the date the decision  is filed, the 
Court  may also order review  of the decision  on its own  motion.   If the Applicant  does not file 
a timely  notice of appeal and the Court  does not order  review on  its own  motion,  the  panel 
decision  will  be final. 

(d) Supreme  Court  Review.   The Court may take any action  consistent  with  its 

constitutional  authority.   The Vermont  Rules of Appellate  Procedure  apply  to an appeal. If 
the Court orders  review  on  its own  motion,  it will specify the  issue(s) to  be addressed by the 
parties.   The Court  may  remand  the decision  to the Committee,  with appropriate directions 
for an expanded  record or additional  findings,  while  retaining  jurisdiction  of the matter. 
The matter  will  be continued,  pending  the  Court's receipt  of the  requested expanded  record 
or additional  findings. 

(e) Appeal  Public  Record.   The notice of appeal and all subsequent  proceedings  are 

public. 

Board's  Notes 

This rule is derived from portions of the prior rules § II.  Minor changes 
from prior rules § 11 reflect the Committee's current practice. 

RULE  19.   RESTRICTION ON  FUTURE  APPLICATION FOR  ADMISSION 

An Applicant  who  is denied  a certification  of Good  Moral  Character  and  Fitness  is not 

eligible  to apply for admission  to the Bar for a period of 2 years after the denial.

Board's  Notes 

This rule is derived from the prior rules §  12. 

The rule is a reorganization of the prior rule governing admission and 
licensing after approval by the Board and the Court. A new provision has 
been added to set deadlines for completing the requirements for 
admission. 

PART VI.  LEGAL  INTERNS 

RULE  21.   ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 

A person who is not yet licensed to practice law in Vermont, but who meets the requirements for 
legal interns may, under attorney supervision, appear as legal counsel in a Vermont court.  An intern 
is bound by the Vermont  Ru1es of Professional Conduct.  An intern must satisfy one of the following 
four  criteria: 

(a) For Students  at Approved  Law Schools,  the intern must: 

(1) be pursuing the study of law  at an Approved Law School; 

(2) be in good standing at the Approved Law School; and 

(3) have completed at least 3 semesters (or the equivalent) at that Approved Law School. 

(b) For Graduates  of Approved  Law Schools,  the intern  must  either: 

(1) be registered for the next administration of the bar examination; 

(2) have taken the bar examination and be awaiting the resu1ts; or 

(3) have passed the bar examination and be awaiting the Committee's 

investigation report or admission to the Bar. 

(c) For LOS Registrants,  the intern  must: 

(1) have completed 3 years of the LOS Program (or the equivalent) under  Ru1e 7 and be in 

the process of completing the final year of the LOS Program; or 

(2) have completed the LOS Program and either: 

(A) be registered for the next administration of the bar examination; 

(B) have taken the bar examination and be awaiting the resu1ts; or 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 28 of 35 

(C) have  passed  the  bar examination  and  be awaiting  the Committee's 

investigation  report or admission  to the Bar. 

(d) For Attorney-Applicants, the  intern  must: 

(1) have his or her application  for admission  without  examination  be approved  by 

the  Board;  and 

(2) either  be  awaiting  the Committee's investigation  report  or admission  to the 

Board's  Notes 

This rule is derived  from  the  prior rules § 13. 

The rules governing  appearance  in court  by legal interns are 
reorganized  for  clarity  but largely  unchanged  in substance. 

ULE  22.   RESTRICTIONS ON  ELIGIBLITY  TO PRACTICE  AS  LEGAL INTERN 

(a) Failure  to Pass  Examination. 

(1) One  Failure.   An intern  who  has failed  to achieve  Vermont's passing  score on the 

bar examination  on his or her first attempt  in Vermont  or another  UBE jurisdiction may 
continue  to be a legal  intern in accordance  with these  rules provided  the  intern: 

(A) is registered  for the next administration  of the bar examination;  and 

(B) has notified  his or her supervising  attorney  of the  failure to achieve 

Vermont's passing  score  and the  supervising  attorney  has agreed  to continue  supervising 
the  Applicant. 

(2) More  than One  Failure.   An intern  who  has failed  to achieve  Vermont's passing 
score  within two  consecutive  administrations  in either  Vermont  or another  UBE jurisdiction 
is no longer  eligible  to be a legal  intern.   However,  the Board  has discretion to waive this 
restriction  for  good  cause. 

(b) Failure  to Establish  Good Moral  Character  and  Fitness.   An individual  denied 

admission  to the Bar for  failure  to establish  Good  Moral Character  and Fitness  is not eligible 
to be a legal intern.

The  rules governing  appearance  in court  by legal  interns  are 
reorganized  for  clarity  but largely  unchanged  in substance.  Rule 
22, governing  prospective  interns who  have failed the  bar 
examination,  reflects  a change  from  § 13(d).  The new rule includes 
certain  disclosure  requirements  for a legal  intern who has failed 
the exam  once. Consistent  with the  prior rule, Rule 22 does not 
allow  a person  who  has failed  the exam  twice  or more to serve as a 
legal intern, absent  approval  by the Board  for  good cause. A person 
who  has been denied  admission  for failure to establish  good moral 
character  and fitness  may  not serve  as a legal intern. 

RULE  23.   MANDATORY   PREREQUISITES FOR  APPEARANCE 

Before appearing  as legal counsel,  a legal intern  must  comply  with all of the 

following  prerequisites: 

(a) File with the subject  court: 

(1) The  client's written  consent  to the  legal  intern's appearance  as  legal  counsel. 

Legal  interns  employed  by state government  agencies  other  than the Office  of the Defender 
General  are excused  from compliance  with this  prerequisite. 

(2) The supervising  attorney's written  consent  to the  intern's  appearance  as  legal 

counsel. 

(3) The supervising  attorney's certification  of compliance  with  these  rules  and  of 

professional  liability  insurance  that  covers the actions  of the intern, which  certification has 
been filed with the subject  court.   Legal  interns employed  by state  government agencies  are 
excused  from  compliance  with  this prerequisite. 

(4) The  intern's certification  of  compliance  with these  rules  and  written 

agreement  to  be bound  by the Rules  of Professional  Conduct. 

(b) Receive  permission,  which  has not been revoked,  from  the subject  court  in the 

exercise  of  its discretion. 

Board's  Notes 

This rule is derived  from  the  prior rules § 13. 

The  rules governing  appearance  in court  by legal  interns  are 
reorganized  for  clarity  but largely  unchanged  in substance. 
Rule 23  includes  a new provision  that exempts  interns  in state 
government  agencies  from  providing  proof  of insurance.  It 
also  exempts  government  interns  (other  than  those  interning 
for the Office of the Defender  General)  from  providing  the 
client's written  consent.  These  new  provisions  remove 

 

900-00014 – Rules of Admission (12/2016) 

Page 30 of 35 

unnecessary barriers to practice  by interns  in government 
agencies. 

RULE  24.   ATTORNEY  SUPERVISION;  AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES 

(a) Supervision  Required.   Appearance  of a legal  intern as legal counsel  is 

conditioned  upon the legal  intern  being supervised  by an attorney. 

(b) Qualification.   To serve as a supervising  attorney  of a legal  intern, the attorney must 

be admitted  to the Vermont  Bar for  not less than 3 years  before the commencement of 
supervision.  For good  cause (for  example,  certain  educational  and/or  prior legal experience; 
admission  to the bar of another  jurisdiction), the Board  may modify  or waive the  requirement 
that the supervising  attorney  have  been admitted  to the  Vermont  Bar for at least  3 years. 

(c) Duties  of Supervision.  A qualified  supervising  attorney  must: 

(1) Assume  personal  professional  responsibility  for the  legal intern's  work; (2) 

Assist  the legal  intern as needed; 

(3) Introduce  the legal  intern to the subject  court  at the legal  intern's  first 

appearance  before that  court; 

(4) Appear with the legal  intern  at all court  appearances  involving  a contested 

(5) Appear with the legal  intern at all other court appearances  unless: 

(A) the  supervising  attorney's appearance  is expressly  waived  by the court; 

matter;  and 

an
d 

(B) the client's written  consent  includes  consent  to appearance  by the  legal 

intern  without  the presence  of the supervising  attorney. 

(d) Authorized  Activities.  A legal  intern  is authorized  to: 

(1) prepare  and sign, with the co-signature  of the supervising  attorney,  petitions, 

complaints,  answers, motions,  briefs, and other  documents  in connection  with the pending 
matter; 

(2) with supervision,  conduct  any nonevidentiary  trial, argument,  or hearing 

in the pending matter,  before the subject  court; and 

(3) with supervision, conduct any evidentiary trial or hearing in the pending 

matter before the court if the legal intern has satisfactorily completed either a course 
in evidence or, if a LOS registrant, a systematic study of evidence certified by the 
supervising  attorney.

(e) Legal Fees for Legal Intern's Services; Compensation to Legal Intern.  The supervising 

attorney,  the  attorney's law  firm, or other  employer  may  charge  the client  a legal  fee, 
which  reflects  the  legal  intern's services,  and may compensate  the  legal intern. This  rule 
does not authorize  a fee-splitting  agreement  between  the supervising  attorney and the legal 
intern or the  direct employment  of a legal  intern  by a client. 

Board’s Notes – 2016 Amendments 

An Amendment to Rule 24(d), effective December 5, 2016, 
requires that legal interns complete a course in evidence  before 
handling  an  evidentiary  proceeding. 

Board's Notes 

This rule is derived  from  the  prior rules § 13. 

The rules governing  appearance  in court  by legal interns  are 
reorganized  for  clarity  but largely  unchanged  in substance.  Rule 
24 includes  a new provision  that allows  the Board  to waive or 
modify, for good  cause, the requirement  that  a supervising 
attorney  be admitted  to the  practice  of law in Vermont  for  three 
years. The rule suggests  that  good cause  may include  certain 
educational  and/or prior legal experience  and admission  to the 
bar  of  another jurisdiction. 

PART VII.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

RULE 25.  APPEAL TO COURT; ORIGINAL JURISDICTION 

Except  as otherwise  provided  in these  rules, an individual  may appeal  from a decision of 

the Board or Committee  by filing  an action  with the Supreme  Court as a matter  of original 
jurisdiction  and  in accordance  with the Vermont  Rules of Appellate  Procedure. 

Board's Notes 

Rule  25  is derived  from the  prior rules § 14(b). 

The rule  is not substantively  changed. 

RULE 26.  FEES; REFUNDS 

All required  fees must  be timely  paid.   Required  fees  are set  by the  Court Administrator 

and published  on the Judiciary  website.   A request for a fee refund  for a withdrawn 
application  must  be made to the Board  in writing.   The Board  has discretion  to grant  a refund 
based on a showing  of extraordinary  circumstances.   Any  refund  excludes 
a nonrefundable  administrative  fee.

Board's Notes

Page 33 of 35 

The  provision  requiring  timely  payment  is consistent  with past 
practice  and added  for clarity.  The specific  fees have  been 
removed from  the  rule and  will  be  posted  on  the Judiciary's 
website:  https://www.vermontjudiciary.org, subject  to  change  by 
the Court  Administrator.  Periodic  fee increases  may  be necessary 
to subsidize  purchase  of the NCBE  testing  materials,  and  it should 
not be necessary  to amend  the rules of admission  each time a fee 
is  changed. 

RULE  27.  INQUIRIES 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All inquiries  regarding  these  rules and related  procedures  for admission  to the Bar 

may be addressed  to the Board at the address  provided  on the Judiciary  website. 

Board's  Notes 

Rule  27  is derived  from the  prior rules § 14(d). 

The  rule is not substantively  changed.  The  rule directs 
inquiries  to be made using the contact  information  available 
on  the  judiciary  website:  https:/www.vermontjudiciary.org. 

RULE  28.   REASONABLE   ACCOMMODATIONS FOR  QUALIFIED APPLICANTS 
WITH  DISABILITIES 

These  rules do  not prevent  the Board from  providing  reasonable  accommodations  to a 
qualified  Applicant  with  a disability  regarding the  application  process, administration  of the 
Uniform  Bar Examination,  and/or  admission  to the Bar.  An Applicant  seeking  a reasonable 
accommodation may  consult  the  Board's website  for  further  information  and instructions. 

Board's  Notes 

Rule  28  is derived  from the  prior rules § 14(e). 

The  prior rule has been edited  for clarity  and to align 
terms with common  usage, but not substantively 
changed. 

RULE  29.  USE  OF COMPUTER  NETWORKS  TO SHARE  INFORMATION 

To efficiently  and effectively  perform their  duties, the Board  and the Committee  may 

utilize various  computer-networking options  to share  information.   When  using those 
networks,  all reasonable  efforts  are made to maintain  the confidentiality of the shared 
information.

materials.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
