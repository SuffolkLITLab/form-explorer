Case No. _________________________ 

 
NOTICE TO PLAINTIFF OF JUDGMENT ORDER
IN SMALL CLAIMS CASES

 

 

he attached Judgment orders the defendant to pay you the amount shown.  If the defendant filed an answer 
or appeared at trial, the court has provided a copy of this Judgment to the defendant and has ordered that 
payment be made directly to you. If instead you obtained a default judgment you must have the default 
judgment served on defendant by a sheriff, deputy sheriff, constable, or person appointed by the Court.  If you 
file any motions to enforce the judgment, you will also need to file the sheriff or constable’s affidavit proving 
that the judgment was served on the defendant. 

he defendant has 30 days in which to appeal the decision. Within the next 30 days the defendant should 
either appeal the decision or pay you the amount due. If the defendant does neither, ask the defendant for 
the money. If the defendant still refuses to pay, you can come back to court in hopes that further court action 
will result in you getting the money that is owed to you. If you wish to take actions to collect on judgment in 
another state, you will need to take the judgment to a court in the other state and follow their procedures for 
enforcing a Vermont judgment 

NOTE: 

You may choose one or more of the four methods listed below to attempt to collect your 
money. The success of any method will depend on the defendant's financial situation and 
willingness to voluntarily pay. No method is guaranteed to succeed. You should consider the 
amount of time and money that you must put into collecting your money and the likelihood of 
success before you make your choice.  You should also consider the attached “List of 
Exemptions” as it may affect your ability to collect. 

ETHOD 1 – WAGE GARNISHMENT, ALSO CALLED TRUSTEE PROCESS 

If the defendant is a wage earner (gets a weekly paycheck) and you know where the defendant works, this 
method is the most likely one to succeed. It enables you to get a court order requiring the defendant's 
employer to deduct money from the defendant's paycheck and pay you directly. You must: 

find out where the defendant is working 

• 
•  download the motion and affidavit form from the website vermontjudiciary.org or request form from 

the court clerk 
fill in the requested information, including the name and address of the defendant's employer 

• 
•  have the form notarized 
• 
•  attend a hearing in court after notification of the hearing date (If the defendant no longer works for 

file the form with the court clerk, along with the required fee 

the named employer, the hearing will be cancelled.) 

f you want to pursue trustee process against property other than earnings, you may want to contact an 
attorney; it is complicated.

100-00276 – Notice to Plaintiff of Judgment Order in Small Claims Cases (06/2022) 

Page 1 of 2 

If you learn at the financial disclosure hearing that the defendant is not a wage earner, does not own any land 
or buildings and does not have any money in the bank, you probably will not be able to recover any money 
until the defendant's financial situation changes. 

If the defendant owns land or buildings in Vermont, this method is likely to provide long term success. It 
enables you to place a lien on the defendant's property in the town land records. Some defendants will 
choose to pay you in order to remove the lien. Those who don't will probably have to pay you at that time in 
the future when they want to sell or transfer their property. You must: 

find out where the defendant owns land or buildings in Vermont 

tell the clerk you would like to record a judgment lien with the town clerk 

tell the clerk the name of the defendant and docket number 

•  ask the clerk for a certified and attested copy of the Judgment Order and pay the clerk the required fee 

for the certified and attested copy 

file the certified and attested copy with the town clerk’s office in the town where the defendant 
owns land or buildings:  The town clerk may require you to pay a recording fee to the town. 
The lien is good for 8 years from date of judgment and can be renewed. 

ETHOD 3 - JUDGMENT LIEN 

  M

ETHOD 4 - WRIT OF EXECUTION 

If the defendant has money or property and will voluntarily pay the money or turn over the property to a 
sheriff who requests it, this method could work. It enables you to get a court order directing the sheriff to 
visit the defendant and demand payment. In most cases the defendant refuses or is unable to pay the 
sheriff and you will end up empty-handed. You must: 

find out where the defendant lives or works 
request a Writ from the court clerk and pay the required fee 
tell the clerk the name of the defendant and docket number, the date and amount of the judgment 
and the date and amount of any payments made to you after the date of the judgment 
take the Writ to the Sheriff in the county where the defendant lives or works and pay the sheriff the 
service and mileage fee 
after the Sheriff returns the writ to you, return the writ to the court clerk 

efore you get too discouraged, note that many defendants comply with court orders and pay the money 

owed. For those who don't, keep in mind that judgments are good for eight years and many people will 
accumulate money within that time. If you don't receive your money within eight years, you can file a new 
case requesting the court to renew your judgment for another eight years. 
Checks or Money Orders should be made payable to Vermont Superior Court with the appropriate post-
judgment fee.

METHOD 2 - FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
If you don't know where the defendant works or what property the defendant owns, this method may 
assist you in learning information that may help you to collect your judgment.  The court will determine 
whether the defendant has the ability to pay.  It enables you to require the defendant to tell the judge 
about ability to pay.  You must: 

• 
request a motion for financial disclosure form from the court 
• 
file the motion and the required fee with the court clerk 
•  attend a court hearing after notification of the hearing date

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
