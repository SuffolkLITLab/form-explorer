___  ACTIVE: An attorney on active status is authorized to practice law in the State of Vermont and must 

comply with the Rules for Mandatory Continuing Legal Education.

and is exempt from compliance with the Rules for Mandatory Continuing Legal Education, except 
to the extent that those rules apply to attorneys who transfer to active status. 

JUDICIAL: An attorney who is a Supreme Court Justice, Superior Judge, Magistrate, or Judicial 
Bureau Hearing Officer has judicial status and is exempt from compliance with the Rules for 
Mandatory Continuing Legal Education.

persons of limited means.  An attorney on pro bono emeritus status is subject to the Rules for

claiming.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
