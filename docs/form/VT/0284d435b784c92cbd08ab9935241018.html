1.  Voluntary Consent: 

After careful consideration, I believe that it is in the best interests of my child to be placed for adoption.  
I voluntarily and unequivocally consent to the transfer of legal and physical custody of this minor child 
to the above named adoption agency for the purposes of adoption and to take any and all measures 
that may be in the best interests of the child.   

.  Revocation of Consent: 

I understand that:  
a)  I may revoke this consent by notifying the court and the adoption agency in writing that I wish to 
revoke this consent.  I understand that my written notice to revoke must be delivered to the court 
within 21 days after this consent is signed or on or before this date:  _______________________ 
 

 
b)  If the adoption agency and I agree, we may jointly revoke this consent any time before finalization of 

21 days from date consent is signed 

 

 

the adoption.  However, if the adoption agency does not agree to revoke after the 21 day period, then 
this consent will become irrevocable on the 22nd day after it was signed; and 

c)  If this consent is obtained by fraud or duress, or if an adoption petition is not filed within 45 days after 

the minor is placed for adoption, without good cause, then I may petition the court to have this 
consent revoked.  The petition may be filed in either the court in which the adoption is pending or in 
the court where the consent is signed. 

.  I certify that the following statements are true:  (check each box if the statement is true.  If the statement is not true, leave 

the box empty.) 

  ☐  I have read this consent or I have had it read to me;  
  ☐  I am signing this consent voluntarily; 
  ☐  Before signing this consent, I was informed of the meaning and consequences of adoption.  I 

understand that, unless otherwise provided in this consent, my signing of this consent and failure to 
timely revoke the consent, terminates any right I may have to object to the minor’s adoption by the 
prospective adoptive parent(s).   

  ☐  I have been informed about the consequences of misidentifying the other parent of this child; 
  ☐  I have been informed about the procedure for releasing information about health, characteristics, and 

identity of myself to the adoptee; 

  ☐  I am a minor and I certify that I was advised by an attorney who is not representing the adoptive 

parent(s) or the adoption agency to which the child is being relinquished.  The name of the attorney 
who gave me advice is _________________________ and he or she is present as this consent is being 
executed; (do not check this box if you are an adult.) 

  ☐  I am an adult and I certify that I was informed of my right to have an attorney represent me in this 

matter, specifically an attorney who is not representing the adoptive parent or the adoption agency to 
which the child is being relinquished; (do not check this box if you are a minor.) 

  ☐  I have provided to the adoptive parent(s), or their agent, non-identifying information about the child’s 

and my family’s health history and background as required by law (15A V.S.A. §2-105).   I understand 
that before the adoption becomes final, if information becomes available to me which was previously 
unavailable, then I have an obligation to provide this information. 

  ☐  I have been informed that it is in the best interests of the minor child that I keep the court or the 

adoption agency informed of my current address and any family health problems of mine which may 
develop and which could affect the child.  This will allow the court or agency to respond to any 
inquiries concerning the minor’s medical or social history.   

  ☐  I have been informed of the procedure for releasing information about the health and other 

characteristics of the parent which may affect the physical or psychological well-being of the minor 
and the legal procedure for release of the parent’s identity.

adoptive parent(s) or agency to permit me to visit or communicate with the minor.  I further understand
