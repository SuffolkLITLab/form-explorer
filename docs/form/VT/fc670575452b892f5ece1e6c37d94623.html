Vermont Family Court Mediation Program 

Agreement to Enter Into Parent Coordination 

1.

Parent Coordination is an alternative dispute resolution service to help separated
parents develop safe, workable parenting plans on behalf of their children.

1.1 This service is offered to parents for whom mediation is inappropriate due to the high 

level of conflict between the parents and/or issues of abuse.  Parent Coordination helps 
parents who are unable or unwilling to meet face-to-face with a neutral third party. 

1.2 Parent child contact, changes in the schedule and holiday or vacation planning, and 
transitions between homes may be among the issues considered.  Communication 
between parents and relationships with extended family members may also be 
addressed. 

1.3 Financial matters, including child support, will not be addressed as part of Parent 

Coordination.  Changes in child support may only be made by order of the Magistrate. 

1.4 Changes in Legal and Physical Parental Rights and Responsibilities may only be 

ordered by the court. 

1.5 If the parties reach agreement regarding a parenting plan, a signed stipulation shall be 

submitted to the Judge for approval and to be ordered. 

1.6 If the parties cannot agree on a parent-child contact/ parenting plan, the Parent 

Coordinator shall submit a report to the court, including a narrative summary of the 
Parent Coordinator’s meetings with the parties and others and detailed 
recommendations for a parent-child contact/ parenting plan.  The Parent Coordinator's 
recommendations may also address the need to have certain issues heard by the court 
at a contested hearing and/or the need for a home study, psychological evaluation, or 
forensic evaluation. The report shall be filed with the court and mailed to the parties at 
least fourteen(14) days prior to the date set for the status conference. 

1.7 A party who objects to the parent-child contact plan proposed by the Parent Coordinator 
shall file written objections with the court within fourteen (14) days after the mailing
(postmark) of the Parent Coordinator’s report and recommendations. The court may 
schedule a hearing on any objections filed with the court within fourteen (14) days. 

1.8 The Judge may generate a temporary order based on the Parent Coordinator’s 

recommendations, which shall remain in effect until the hearing on objections. 

1.9 The Judge may choose to adopt and order all or some of the Parent Coordinator’s 
recommendations if no objection is filed by a party within fourteen (14) days, with 
or without a hearing. 

1.10 Motions for hearings with either the Judge or Magistrate must be filed by either the 

parties themselves or by their attorneys.

Vermont Family Court Mediation Program 

1.11 During the process, if parents are in disagreement, the Parent Coordinator is authorized 
to direct the parties only on minor issues of parent child contact schedule such as; pick 
up and drop off times, telephone times and procedure, exchange of children’s clothing, 
etc. if he/she believes that this is in the best interests of the children. 

1.12 Parties are expected to participate in Parent Coordination with a good faith commitment 
to a non-adversarial process.  While periodic status conferences with the Judge are a 
normal part of the planning process, threats of contested custody hearings or motions for 
contested custody hearings may result in termination of Parent Coordination. 

1.13 Participation in Parent Coordination may be requested by either parent, by the Family 

Court Judge or by the parties’ attorneys.  In most cases, participation is a voluntary effort 
by the parents to resolve child-related issues in a non-adversarial process. 

2.  The Parent Coordinator works with parents in a structured process. 

2.1 Conferences with the Parent Coordinator are ordinarily held during regular court hours 

(8:00am and 4:30 pm) and usually take place either at the Parent Coordinator’s office or 
at the courthouse. 

2.2 Initial meetings with each parent shall be held separately. If there are ongoing issues of 
safety, subsequent meetings shall be held separately.  If there are no issues of safety, 
subsequent meetings may be held separately or together at the Parent Coordinator’s 
discretion and the parties’ wishes. 

2.3 If the Parent Coordinator detects the use of alcohol or other drug-related impairments 

during a conference, that conference will be canceled. 

2.4 In addition to developing parenting plans, the Parent Coordinator may assist with 

referrals to services in the community that are needed in order to implement the plans. 

2.5 Fees for Parent Coordination services are arranged directly with the Parent Coordinator. 

Payment is expected in advance of service and is based upon the Subsidized Fee 
Scale. Fees cover time spent in consultation with parents, children, attorneys and other 
professionals. Time spent in documentation and at court is also billed to parents. 

3.  Parent Coordination is a non-confidential, child-centered process. 

3.1 The goal of Parent Coordination is to develop plans that reduce the risk of children’s 

exposure to parental conflict. 

3.2 Parents are required to sign a release of information so that therapists, attorneys, 

physicians or other professionals and individuals involved with the child and family may 
speak with the Parent Coordinator. This release will direct agencies or schools to 
authorize a release of information directly to the Parent Coordinator. 

3.3 The Parent Coordinator is an advocate for your child(ren) and may make 

recommendations about visitation schedules, safety issues, drop-off and pick-up 
arrangements, and other child-related concerns. 

3.4 Parent Coordination may include one or more meetings with the child(ren) either in their 
home or in a community setting.  These contacts are intended to provide children with an 
opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings directly to the Parent Coordinator.

3.5 Recommendations and referrals made to the parents by the Parent Coordinator will be 
made in writing, with copies to the parties, attorneys, the court and other relevant 
parties. 

3.6 Signed stipulations, parenting plans and interim parenting plans will be submitted 

to the Judge for approval and to be ordered. 

3.7 The Parent Coordinator may also write summary memos to both parents describing the 
level of participation in the process, agreements reached and child-related concerns. 
Copies of memos to both parents will be placed in the court file. 

3.8 If the Parent Coordinator discovers that a child is being inappropriately touched, 

otherwise abused, or neglected, a report will be made to the Department of DCF. 
Likewise, if threats of violence are directed at one parent by the other, or at any another 
party, those threats will be reported to either or both the police and/or the court. 

3.9 The Parent Coordinator reserves the right to terminate the dispute resolution process for 
reasons of safety and/or a party’s refusal to cooperate and/or a party’s refusal to pay for 
the parent coordinator’s services. 

“I have read and understand the terms of this agreement and agree to abide by them.”

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
