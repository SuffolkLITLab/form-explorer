      <pre>Filing a Petition to Expunge or Seal a Criminal Record 

A person may be able to have the record of a Vermont conviction or charge either expunged or sealed under certain 
limited circumstances. There are several different types of expungement and sealing and the conditions are somewhat 
different for each type. 

1.  Expungement or Sealing of Criminal Conviction Record 

A person may file a petition to expunge or seal the record of a criminal conviction if: 

- 

- 

- 

- 

The petitioner was convicted of a qualifying crime or qualifying crimes out of the same incident 
or occurrence (see definition of qualifying crimes below); or 
The petitioner was convicted of an offense for which the underlying conduct is no longer prohibited by 
law or designated as a criminal offense. 
The petitioner was convicted of a violation of 23 VSA §1201(a) related to operating under the influence of 
alcohol or other substance (see section E below). 
The petitioner was convicted under 13 VSA §1201(a) related to burglary when the person was 25 years of 
age or younger and did not carry a dangerous or deadly weapon during commission of the offense (see 
section F below) 

-  Please be advised: If you have a pending criminal case, the court cannot act on a petition to seal or 

expunge until after the pending charge is resolved 

A.  When the Petitioner has not been convicted of another crime since the conviction: 

The criminal history record will be expunged by the Court if: 
-  At least 5 years have elapsed since the petitioner successfully completed the terms of the sentence for the 
conviction, or if the petitioner successfully completed all terms of an indeterminate sentence which began 
at least 5 years before the petition is filed; 

-  Any restitution ordered by the Court has been paid in full; and 
- 

The Court finds that expungement of the criminal history record serves the interest of justice. 

The criminal history record will be sealed by the Court if: 
- 
- 
- 

The conditions described above are met; and 
The Court finds that sealing the criminal history record better serves the interest of justice; and 
The petitioner committed the qualifying crime after reaching 19 years of age. 

B.  When Petitioner has been convicted of another crime arising out of a new occurrence since the Petitioner was 

convicted of the qualifying crime: 
The criminal history will be expunged if: 
-  At least 10 years have elapsed since the date on which the petitioner successfully completed the terms 

- 

and conditions of the sentence for the conviction; 
The petitioner has not been convicted of a felony arising out of a new incident or occurrence since the 
petitioner was convicted of the qualifying crime; 
The petitioner has not been convicted of a misdemeanor during the past 5 years; 

- 
-  Any restitution ordered by the Court has been paid 
-  After considering the particular nature of any subsequent offense, the Court finds that expungement 

serves the interest of justice. 

The criminal history will be sealed if: 
-  All of the above conditions are met and the Court finds that: 
- 
- 

Sealing of the criminal history record better serves the interests of justice than expungement; and 
The person committed the qualifying crime after 19 years of age 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C. 

If the petition seeks expungement or sealing of a record when there was no conviction: 
A person who was cited or arrested may file a petition for expungement of the criminal history record at 
any time: The criminal history will be sealed or expunged if: 
- 

The Court finds that sealing or expunging the record serves the interests of justice, or if the parties stipulate 

200-00130A –  Filing a Petition to Expunge or Seal a Criminal Record (02/2020) 
 

  Page 1 of 5 

to sealing or expungement of the record. 
 

For those individuals cited or arrested after June 30, 2018, sealings and expungements typically occur without 
need of filing formal petitions.   

D.  If the petition is for expungement of a criminal offense for which the underlying conduct is no longer 

prohibited by law or designated a criminal offense, the Court will expunge the record if: 
-  Petitioner proves that the conviction was based on possessing an amount of regulated drug that is no 
longer prohibited by law or for which criminal sanctions have been removed if the conviction is for 
possession of a regulated drug under 18 V.S.A. chapter 84, subchapter 1 in an amount that is no longer 
prohibited by law or for which criminal sanctions have been removed; 

-  Petitioner has served or completed the sentence; 
-  All court-ordered restitution has been paid; 
-  Unless the Court finds that expungement of the criminal history record is not in the interest of justice. 

E. 

If the petition seeks to seal a conviction for violation of 23 V.S.A. §1201(a) related to operating under the 
influence of alcohol or other substance, the Court will seal the record if:  
-  At least 10 years have elapsed since the date on which the person successfully completed the terms and 
conditions of the sentence for the conviction, or if the person has successfully completed the terms and 
conditions of an indeterminate term of probation that commenced at least 10 years previously; 
-  At the time of filing the petition, the person has only one conviction of a violation of 23 V.S.A. §1201; 
-  At the time of filing the petition, the person has not been convicted of a crime arising out of a new incident 

or occurrence since the person was convicted of a violation of 23 VSA §1201(a); 

-  All court-ordered restitution has been paid; 
- 
- 
- 

The court finds sealing serves the interests of justice; 
The violation did not result in serious bodily injury or death to any person other than the operator; 
The violation did not involve operation of a school bus with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.02 or more or 
operation a commercial vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more 

-  Petitioner is not an individual licensed as a commercial driver pursuant to 23 V.S.A. chapter 39 

 

F. 

If the petition seeks expungement or sealing of a conviction for violation of 13 VSA 1201(c)(3)(A) related to 
burglary when the person was 25 years of age or younger and the person did not carry a dangerous or deadly 
weapon during commission of the offense, the Court will grant the petition if: 
-  At least 15 years have elapsed since the date on which the person successfully completed the terms and 
conditions of the sentence for the conviction, or the person has successfully completed the terms and 
conditions of an indeterminate term of probation that commenced at least 15 years previously; 
The person has not been convicted of a crime arising out of a new incident or occurrence since the person 
was convicted of a violation of 1201(c)(3)(A); 

- 

-  All court-ordered restitution has been paid; 
- 

The court finds that expungement or sealing of the criminal history record serves the interests of justice.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What does expungement mean? 
If your case has been expunged, this means that all the records related to your criminal charge are physically destroyed 
by court order. This includes all information documenting your contact with the criminal justice system including police 
reports, records in the prosecutor’s office and court records. 

What is the difference between expungement and sealing? 
Sealing and expungement are similar in many respects. In either case: 

•  You must be treated as though you had never been charged or convicted of the offense. 
•  You cannot be required to answer questions about your criminal history record in employment or license 

•  You cannot be required to answer questions about the offense or incident if called as a witness. 
• 

If the court or law enforcement agency receives a question about a record which has been expunged or sealed, 
the response mandated by law is: “No record exists.” 

•  You will receive a certificate from the court stating that all records of arrest, conviction and sentence have been 

applications. 

annulled. 

The major difference between expungement and sealing is what happens to the records themselves. If all charges in a 
criminal history record are expunged all records in the possession of the court, department of corrections, law 
enforcement and the prosecutor must be physically destroyed as described above. If your criminal history record is 
sealed, the records are placed in a confidential file, but are not physically destroyed. The entity in possession of a sealed 
record, such as law enforcement or a prosecutor, can use the records for future criminal investigations. 

What is the process for filing a Petition to Expunge or Seal? 

1.  Request to view your file from the Court: You may want to review your file. Some files may be stored at Public 
Records, in which case, the clerk will have to make a request to send the file to the court. There is a charge for 
retrieving a record that is stored in public records. The retrieval fee must be paid prior to ordering files stored at 
Public Records. The unpaid retrieval fees could delay the expungement or sealing process. If you send a written 
request to the court to view your file, you should also include a check or money order payable to the Vermont 
Superior Court.  Your request should also include a phone number so that the clerk can notify you when your file 
arrives.  The court will be able to tell you if the file is in public records. 

2.  Restitution and Fines: Any restitution ordered by the Court and any fines or fees assessed must be paid in full 

prior to the determination whether your criminal case qualifies for expungement or sealing. 

3.  Form -Petition to Expunge or Seal Criminal History: Complete and file a Petition to Expunge or Seal Criminal 
History form. The Petition is a court form that can be obtained from the Court or on the Vermont Judiciary 
website. There is a $90 fee to file a petition to seal a conviction of a violation of 23 V.S.A. §1201(a). If you are 
unable to pay the filing fee, you may complete and file the form Application to Waive Filing Fees. The Court 
will notify you if you qualify to have the filing fee waived. As of July 1, 2019, there is no fee required for filing 
all other petitions to seal or expunge. 

4.  Respondent: The respondent in an expungement case is the prosecutor who brought the criminal charge. The 

Clerk will provide the respondent with a copy of your petition. 

5.  Response from Prosecutor: The prosecutor is entitled to file a response to your petition. If the prosecutor agrees 

with your request for expungement, your petition may be granted without a hearing. If the prosecutor is 
opposed to your request, the court will schedule the matter for a hearing. You must attend any hearings 
scheduled in your case. Failure to attend could result in the dismissal of your petition.

  Page 4 of 5 

6.  Response from Victim: The law requires the Prosecutor to make a reasonable effort to notify any known victim(s) 

of the offense which you are seeking to expunge or seal. A victim of the offense has the right to provide a 
statement to the prosecutor and the court. 

 

 

7. 

If your Petition is Granted: If your petition is granted, the court will issue an order which you can use in the 
event you need to prove that the offense has been expunged or sealed. 

8. 

If your Petition is Denied: If your petition for expungement is denied by the court, no further petition shall be 
brought for at least two (2) years, unless a shorter duration is authorized by the Court.
