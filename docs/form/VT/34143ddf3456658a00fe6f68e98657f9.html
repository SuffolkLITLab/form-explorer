GENERAL OVERVIEW 

Are you named in a will as the executor of an estate? Is it possible that the Probate Court 
may consider appointing you as the administrator of an estate for someone who died 
without a will? If the answer is “yes,” then you will need to become familiar with the duties 
and responsibilities of a “
Court to be either the executor or administrator of an estate. 

.” A fiduciary includes any person appointed by the 

fiduciary

As a fiduciary, your primary responsibility is the prompt, efficient and impartial 
administration of the decedent’s estate. There are two main purposes for probating a 
decedent’s estate: 

payment of debts owed by the decedent; and 

distribution of the remaining assets in the estate to those legally entitled to 
receive them. 
YOU MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY ASSETS TO ANY BENEFICIARY WITHOUT 
PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE COURT. 

In order to achieve these purposes, the law requires you to: 

Identify and collect all assets of the estate; 

Pay the debts of decedent. If the amount of debts appears to be greater than the 
value of the assets (an insolvent estate), you should not pay any debts until you are 
ordered to do so by the court. 

Notify “Interested Persons” and parties of all matters which may affect their 
interests.

Forms for most documents that you are required to file with the court are available at the 
courthouse or on the court’s website, www.vermontjudiciary.org under Forms for Estates. 
You should always use a pre-approved court form if one is available rather than 
attempting to make up your own form. 

It is your responsibility to administer the estate competently and promptly in accordance 
with law. If you fail to do so, the court may impose sanctions. Sanctions may include your 
removal as the fiduciary.

SMALL ESTATES 

If the Decedent (the person who died) did not own any real estate other 
than a timeshare and the estate is worth less than $45,000.00, you can use 
the Small Estate procedure to probate the Estate. The procedure is 
governed by Probate Court Rule 80.3. To open the Estate, you will have to 
file the following with the Court: 

A Petition on the form provided on the  website; 

The entry or filing fee; 

A certified copy of the Death  Certificate; 

An Inventory; 

 

1.
 

2.
 

3.
 

4.
 

5.
 

A copy of a paid bill for funeral expenses with a receipt from the 
funeral home, or a bond in the sum of  $300; 

6.

And the original Will if there was  one. 

Once the Court approves the Will, you should pay any known debts of the 
deceased and funeral expenses and then distribute the balance in 
accordance with the terms of the Will, or in accordance with the intestate 
laws if there was no Will. You should then file a Report with the Court 
stating what debts you paid, and how the funds were distributed. You 
should also include receipts for anyone who received a distribution from 
the Estate.

Forms for the documents to file can be found on the Court’s website or at 
the courthouse.

ESTATE 

If the estate’s value is greater than $45,000.00, or there was real estate other 
than a Time Share in the Estate, you will need to follow a more formal 
DECEDENT’S ESTATE 
procedure. To begin, you will need to file a 

PETITION TO OPEN 

with the Court. You must file the Petition in the 

Probate Division in the county where the decedent resided at the time of 
approximate 
death. In the Petition, you will list the name and residence of the decedent, the 

value of any real estate and personal estate that the decedent 
owned at the time of death, and whether or not there was a Last Will and 
Testament. You will also need to pay a filing fee to the "Vermont Superior 
Court." The fee is based upon the value of the Estate. The Vermont Judiciary 
website (www.vermontjudiciary.org) has a list of the filing fees.

When  you  file  the  Petition  with  the  Court,  you  must  also  include  a 
certified copy of the Death Certificate, and the

Testament, if there is one.

This will include

all surviving children of the decedent, and the children of any child 
who has died before the decedent), plus all other persons or entities 
named in the Last Will and Testament. You must provide the Court 
with certified copies of the death certificates for any of 
the heirs who are deceased. In the List, you should state whether 
children [or grandchildren] of the decedent are also children [or 
grandchildren] of the surviving spouse or are children [or 
grandchildren] of the decedent through a previous spouse/partner. If 
there are no surviving spouse, children or grandchildren, or there is 
no Will, the issue is rather complicated and more than can be

In the Petition, you will ask the Court to open the Estate and name you as the 
Fiduciary to administer the estate. Court approval occurs in one of two ways. If all of 
the 
sign a Consent form agreeing to the Court's approval of the Last Will 
and Testament and the appointment of you as the Fiduciary, the Court does not need 
to hold a hearing to allow the Will. The heirs will agree by signing the Consent which 
is part of the Petition. 

If there are beneficiaries other than the heirs at law named in the Will, however, such 
as nieces and nephews, or Charities, the Court is required to hold a Hearing. You can 
avoid the need for a Hearing if those people and entities sign a Waiver saying that 
they agree that a Hearing is not needed. 

700-00302 – Probating a Vermont Estate (08/2019) 

If not all of the heirs will consent, or you are unable to obtain their consent, the 
Court will have to hold a hearing. The Court will send you a Notice of Hearing. 

You

will need to send a copy of the Notice of Hearing, Petition, and Last Will and 
Testament (if any) by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each of the 
heirs and beneficiaries named in the Will. Signed receipts dated at least 14 
days before the date of hearing must be filed with the Court. You will also 
need to file a Certificate of Service with the Court listing the individual to 
whom you sent the documents and their addresses. 

At the Hearing, you will have to "prove" the Last Will and Testament if there is a 
Will. If an heir is challenging the Will, all of the Witnesses in the Will should be 
made available to testify. This is a complicated matter and beyond the scope of this 
Summary. 

If there is no Last Will and Testament, you will ask in the Petition simply that you 
be appointed Fiduciary. This is called an "Intestate Estate." Vermont law will 
determine how the property in the Estate will be distributed. 
Administration Bond 
Before the Court will actually appoint you, you will need to file an 

Estate 

with the Court. This is your promise to administer the Estate 

properly. The court may or may not require a Surety. A Surety can be an individual 
who is willing to guarantee your performance, or an insurance company that will 
reimburse the Estate if a Fiduciary improperly administers the Estate. The 
insurance company will charge a fee, which will be an administration expense 
(discussed below) which should be paid from the Estate. 
FILING THE INVENTORY. 

Probate Rule 66a. 

Within 30 days after your appointment as the Fiduciary, you must file with the Court a list 
of all of the decedent’s assets. This list is called the “Inventory,” and can be found on the 
Vermont Judiciary website. This filing deadline may be extended up to a maximum of 90 
days from the date of appointment, but only for a good reason and only if the extension is 
Describe each asset as accurately as you can and 
approved by the court. 
record the fair market value as of the date of the decedent’s death. Each titled asset (such 
as real estate, motor vehicles, bank accounts, investment accounts, etc.) must be itemized 
separately. Untitled assets (such as household furniture and furnishings and personal 
effects) may be aggregated and listed in a group if doing so results in a fair representation, 
unless specific items are given to specific people in the Will. It is not necessary to list every 
piece of furniture and personal item separately; list only those of substantial value such as 
valuable antiques. 

not 

Do 

• 

list any of the following assets in the Inventory: 

Assets jointly owned with another person (for example, property owned as joint 
tenants with rights of survivorship). NOTE: this does not include assets which may 
have been owned as tenants in common. In that case, you should include the 
decedent's fractional share.

• 

• 

• 

Insurance policies with a designated beneficiary living at the time of decedent’s 
death. 

Bank accounts and other assets payable or transferable on death. 

Any other asset which passes directly to another person without probate action, 
such as Annuities, IRA's, 401(k) Accounts and Retirement Accounts in which a 
beneficiary is named. 

If an Annuity, IRA or Retirement Account does not have a named beneficiary, or if the 
named beneficiaries die before the decedent, the Account should be included in the 
Inventory. 

If you are unsure as to whether an asset should be included, include it, or contact an 
attorney. 

In preparing the Inventory, you may need to contact a financial institution to obtain the 
balance in an account at that Institution. To prove that you are the Fiduciary and have the 
authority to obtain the information, use a Certificate of Appointment. This document is 
commonly required by banks, investment companies, brokerage firms, insurance 
companies, decedent’s employers, and the Social Security Administration. When you are 
appointed, the Court will issue two Certificates of Appointment. Often, a photocopy will be 
sufficient to show your appointment, although you may have to show a certified copy first. If 
you need extra Certificates of Appointment, the Court will issue them for a nominal fee. 

How you determine date-of-death fair-market-values of the decedent’s assets is within 
your discretion and judgment; however, the values you determine may have significant tax 
implications for the estate or the person who receives the asset. If you are unable to 
estimate values with confidence or determine values from independent reliable sources, 
you may decide to hire one or more appraisers. Situations in which professional appraisals 
may be appropriate include real estate, specific items given to specific persons, items of 
perceived significant value, items which must be divided among persons, and items the 
value of which is or may become disputed. If you later find that you have omitted or 
incorrectly valued an asset, you may file an amended Inventory or make an appropriate 
entry on your next account. 
You must mail copies of your signed and notarized Inventory to all parties. Probate

SEPARATE BANK ACCOUNTS. 

You also need to file a Certificate of Service with the Court listing 

You must maintain separate accounts (such as checking and savings accounts) for estate 
funds. The account name should be " Estate of [name of Decedent], [your name], 
Fiduciary."

Before you open an account for the Estate you will need to obtain a Tax Identification 
Number (sometimes referred to as an EIN or TIN) for the Estate. You obtain the Number by 
going to the Internal Revenue Service website, IRS.gov, and applying for the number using

IRS FORM SS-4. You will need the Decedent's Social Security Number and your Social 
Number through the Internet, please be sure that you are on the Internal Revenue 
Security Number to get the Taxpayer Identification Number. 
Service Website. There is no charge for obtaining the Number from the IRS. There are 
websites with similar names, however, that will charge you a fee. 

Use the Estate's Tax Identification Number for the account, not your Social Security 
Number or the decedent's Social Security Number, when opening the account. 

Estate funds must be kept separate from your personal funds and must not be mixed with 
funds belonging to anyone else. You must keep exact records of all assets coming into the 
estate and all assets paid out or distributed from the estate. Ledger sheets having columns 
for “Date”, Description of Transaction”, and whether the asset came “In” or went “Out” 
should provide a complete and accurate record. You will need this information to prepare 
the Accounting for the Estate, which is discussed later. 
  5. 
 

SPOUSAL ELECTIONS AND RIGHTS. 

A surviving spouse has certain rights which take priority over the rights of other family 
members and non-family members named in the Will. Within 30 days of your appointment 
as the fiduciary the court must provide the surviving spouse with a notice of these rights. A 
surviving spouse must elect any desired spousal rights within 8 months of the date you are 
appointed as the fiduciary. Any election must be in writing and filed with the court. The 
possible elections and rights include: 

1. 

2. 

3.

The election to waive the provisions made for the surviving spouse in the 
Probate Rule 13 & 14 VSA Section

claims and expenses of administration.

DEALING WITH CREDITORS. 

.

6. 

14 VSA Section 316

 

Part of your duties as a Fiduciary is to make sure that the Decedent’s debts are paid. The 
purpose of the Notice to Creditors is to alert creditors that they must file claims with the 
700-00302 – Probating a Vermont Estate (08/2019) 
Court and with you within 4 months of the date of publication if they wish to be paid. If a 

Page 6 of 11 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

creditor fails to do this, the creditor’s claim may be barred. 

Notices to creditors are handled in one of two ways: 

 

1.

2. 

If you are certain that you know of all the decedent’s debts (including Medicaid 
reimbursement claims) or that the decedent had no debts, you may file a Motion to 
Waive the Notice to Creditors asking the court to waive the requirement to publish 
the Notice to Creditors. Being allowed not to publish the Notice to Creditors may 
save some money and enable you to close the estate sooner; however, carefully 
consider the advantages and disadvantages. If the decedent had creditors you do 
not know about, failing to publish the Notice extends the time within which 
creditors may file a claim to 3 years after the date of decedent’s death. If a claim is 
made after the Estate is closed, the creditor can pursue individuals who received 
distributions from the Estate up to the amount of the distribution. 

The alternative is to publish a Notice to Creditors in the local newspaper. Within 
thirty (30) days of your appointment as fiduciary, you must publish a Notice to 
Creditor (a form that can be found on the Vermont Judiciary website) once in a 
newspaper generally circulating in the community in which the decedent was a 
resident. You should ask the Court clerk which newspaper or newspapers can be 
used. You must provide the Court with satisfactory proof of publication by filing a 
copy of the Notice published in the Newspaper

. 

In addition, you should send a copy of the Notice to Creditors to all known creditors and to 
creditors reasonably ascertainable by you. 

14 VSA Section 1205. 

If you published the Notice to Creditors, you should not pay any claims until the 4-month 
period for filing claims has expired. You will then know if there are sufficient assets in the 
estate to pay all valid claims. If there is not enough money to pay all valid claims, the law 
sets a priority of which claims must be paid, in what amounts, and in what order. The list 
of priorities can be found in 
not entitled to be paid, you, personally, may have to repay the estate for the amount 
improperly paid. In estates where there is not enough money to pay all the debts in full, a 
hearing will be held and the Court will issue a formal Order of Dividend determining the 
priority of claims and the amounts to be paid. 
HANDLING CLAIMS OF CREDITORS. 
7. 

If you make a mistake and pay a claim 

If a creditor files a claim against the Estate, you must decide how to respond. To contest or 
deny a claim, you must send a Disallowance of Claim to the creditor within 60 days after 
receiving the claim. You should also file a copy of the disallowance with the Court. 

The Notice you send MUST include the following statement of warning to the creditor: 

Page 7 of 11 

Unless you file a petition with the Probate Division asking the court to allow your 
claim, or unless you file a proceeding against the personal representative of the 
Rev.1.4.18.csf 
Estate in the Civil Division, within 60 days after this Notice is disallowed, your claim 

-6 - 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

will be barred forever. 

There is a form on the court website (or at the courthouse) for denying a claim which 
contains this language, so we suggest that you use that form. 

If you contest or deny the claim within the proper time, the creditor must file a petition 
with the Court, or file a lawsuit in the Civil Division, within 60 days after the mailing of the 
notice. Failure to do so will result in the claim being denied. 

If the creditor files a petition, the court will hold a hearing on the petition and determine 
whether or not the claim should be allowed. 

When claims are paid, you must file with the court the creditor’s release of the claim 
signed by the creditor, or other evidence of payment of the claim satisfactory to the court. 
8. 

ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES. 

During your administration of the estate you are responsible for preserving the assets of 
the estate. Doing so may require you to arrange for the safe storage of tangible personal 
property, keeping real estate and tangible personal property insured, paying promissory 
notes secured by estate assets, paying gas, electric, fuel and similar bills. Bills for 
gathering, preserving and maintaining estate assets are called Administration Expenses. 
Administration Expenses have priority over creditors’ claims. 
You are not responsible for paying these administration expenses or the 
decedent's debts from your personal funds.

reimbursed from the Estate. 
9. 

LICENSES TO SELL. 

If you do so, and there is not enough 

If you determine that it is necessary or in the best interest of the estate and the persons 
interested in the estate to sell real or personal estate, or to convey, mortgage or lease real 
or personal estate, you must file a

special rules for selling real or personal estate at PUBLIC AUCTION. 

Motion for License to Sell

. (Personal property, 

When filing a Motion for License to Sell with respect to real estate, it is important that you 
accurately describe the real estate. This is usually done by listing the date, Volume and 
Page of the Deed through which the Decedent acquired the real estate. 
Because you will need an attorney when you sell the real estate, it is advisable that 
you obtain an attorney's advice and help in preparing the Motion for License to Sell 
for real estate. You should also file a proposed License to Sell with the Court. 

There 
is a fee for filing the Motion for License to Sell Real Estate. Before filing the Motion, check 
with the Court to see what the fee is.

As a matter of planning, you may wish to review your Inventory and request licenses to 
sell for any asset which might be sold during administration of the estate even though you 
may not have any immediate plans to dispose of an asset. Any asset for which a license to 
sell is requested must be carefully described and match the description in your Inventory. 

Unless all parties consent to a Motion for License to Sell, or unless the decedent’s Will 
specifically grants the requested power to the Fiduciary, the court will schedule a hearing 
and provide notice to all parties. 
the court will issue the license to sell. A certified copy of any license to sell for real estate 
must be delivered for recording to the Town Clerk when the real estate is sold.

. If your motion is granted 

The Court may increase the amount of your bond before issuing a license because you will 
control more liquid assets after the sale than previously. You must file a Report on the 
License within 30 days of the transaction. 
10. 

PURCHASING ASSETS FOR THE ESTATE. 

Because you are responsible for conserving assets of the estate, you should not 
purchase new assets without Court permission.

ACCOUNTINGS.

interested parties, the court will hold a hearing on the interim account. 

It may be helpful to think of it in these terms: the assets with which the Estate started the 
accounting period, as shown on the Inventory or most recent interim account as the case 
may be, plus what additional assets and income that have come into the Estate's 
possession or control, less what you have paid out and distributed, is the balance on hand 
for distribution to the heirs at law and other persons named in the will, if any. The 
Schedules that are part of the Accounting are simply separate pages on which you provide 
the details of the appropriate transactions; the total from each Schedule is then 
transferred to the account form. More than one Schedule may appear on a sheet but the 
Schedules must be kept in the order established by the account form. 

Some assets (stocks, bonds, investment accounts, and real estate, for example) 
frequently change market value over the course of estate administration due to

FINAL ACCOUNTING. 

It is important to be aware that all creditors’ claims must be resolved before there 
can be any distribution from the Estate. This includes paying the debts of the 
decedent and any successful claims made against the Estate. Occasionally, there is 
not enough money in the Estate to pay all of the debts and claims. In that case, none 
of the heirs or the beneficiaries named in the Last Will and Testament will receive 
anything. 

In addition, the Court will want to be sure that the Funeral Bill has been paid, so 
you will need to submit to the Court a copy of the paid funeral bill. 

Once you have collected all of the decedent's assets, sold any assets when appropriate, and 
paid all of the decedent's bills, you should file a Final Summary of Account with the Court. 
In this, you will list the assets you started with or assets from the last interim accounting, 
any additional assets found, and income earned, less remaining bills, Administrative 
Expenses, and Attorney and fiduciary fees that you have paid, and list the assets remaining 
in the Estate. With respect to Attorney and fiduciary fees, you should include a copy of 
attorney fee invoices and an itemized summary of the charges that you propose as 
fiduciary. Finally, you should also include a proposed Distribution of the remaining assets. 
If there is a Last Will and Testament, the proposed Distribution should be in accordance 
with the terms of the Will. If there is no Last Will and Testament, the Distribution will be in 
accordance with the intestate laws of Vermont. The intestate laws are provisions that 
provide how the Estate will be distributed when there is no Last Will and Testament. It can 
become rather complicated to determine how the Estate will be divided, so you should 
consult with an attorney to complete this process. 

You will need to send a copy of the Final Accounting to each of the individuals entitled to

. After you send the Notice and Final Accounting to 

each of the individuals, you will need to file a Certificate of Service with the Court showing 
that you mailed the Notice and Final Accounting to each of the individuals. Objections to the 
Final Accounting must be filed in writing with the Court at least 7 days before the hearing 
date. 

Sometimes, it is best to ask the Court to schedule a Hearing even if you expect everyone to 
Consent. This gives everyone a deadline by which they need to send you the Consent form.

13.  FIDUCIARY AND ATTORNEY FEES. 

Fiduciary and attorney fees must be shown in detail (date, activity, hourly rate, time spent, 
and total). They may not be paid until approved by the court. The Court will review all fees 
for reasonableness. Among the factors are the time and labor required and the experience 
of the fiduciary and attorney. 
14.  TAXES. 

Probate Rule 66(c) 

You are responsible for filing all tax returns and forms. These may include final federal and 
state income tax returns for the decedent (unless a surviving spouse elects to file a 
joint return for the decedent’s year of death), federal and state fiduciary income tax 
returns (income tax returns for the estate), federal and state gift and estate tax returns, 
and other forms if the decedent was an employer. The fiduciary should contact the 
decedent’s usual tax preparer for information and coordinate compliance either with that 
preparer or another of the fiduciary’s choosing. 

You will not be able to close the Estate until the Vermont Department of Taxes issues a 
Clearance Letter indicating all taxes, if any, have been paid. To obtain the Clearance Letter, 
you will need to send the Vermont Department of Taxes an Application for Tax Clearance 
form. (Form E2A is available at the Vermont Department of Taxes website.) 

The Court will not issue the final Decree of Distribution until it has received the Clearance 
Letter from the Tax Department. 
15. 

COMPLETING AND CLOSING THE ESTATE. 

Assuming that the Court approves the Final Accounting, the Court will issue a Decree of 
Distribution telling you how the remaining Estate Assets should be distributed. It is then 
your responsibility to distribute the assets in accordance with the terms of the Decree. You 
will need to obtain a Receipt from each of the parties receiving something from the Estate. 
Once you have received Receipts from all of the individuals, you will need to file a 
Fiduciary's Closing Report, together with the Receipts, with the Court. The Court will then 
issue an Order closing the Estate.
