Q U A L I F I C A T I O N S

To be a juror, you must be a U.S.
citizen, 18 years of age or older, and speak
and understand English.

You must live in the county in which you
have been called to serve, and you cannot
have served in the last 3 years.

Please review the
Reasons For Disqualification
on the back for more information.

W H A T I S A G R A N D J U R Y
The grand jury hears evidence presented by a prosecutor.
It does not determine guilt or innocence, but instead it
determines if there is enough evidence to indict or charge
a person or corporation with a crime. A grand jury consists
of 23 people as compared with the 6 or 12 people who
comprise a trial
jury. The length of grand juror service
varies and depends upon the number of pending criminal
matters that are brought before it. A grand jury usually sits
sporadically for 3 months, meeting as often as required.
Scheduling varies from county to county.

C O U R T L O C A T I O N
Because grand juries are convened at only one site within
each judicial district, grand jurors may not change their
court location.

D E F E R M E N T
If you have a hardship, you may request deferment of your
date of service to a different date within 12 months of your
originally scheduled date. To request a deferment, com-
plete Section 3A of the Grand Juror Confirmation Form or
the appropriate section of the Form online. Prospective
grand jurors may request deferment of their service to
either January, April, July, or October (most grand juries
are convened only during those months). You must pro-
vide a detailed explanation of your hardship.

M A P & D I R E C T I O N S
You will receive a map and directions to the courthouse
about ten days before you are to serve. Maps, directions,
and other information about your courthouse are also avail-
able online.

C O M P E N S A T I O N
By law, your Massachusetts employer must pay you for
work hours you miss during the first three days of jury
service. This applies to all employees: full-time, part-time,
temporary and casual. Failure to compensate employees
is a crime. Please consult with your employer regarding its
compensation policy and complete the enclosed CONFI-
DENTIAL FINANCIAL QUESTIONNAIRE on the other side
of this brochure so that the amount of compensation you
receive from the Commonwealth (maximum of $50 per day)
for each day after your 3rd day of service may be deter-
mined.

R E S I D E N T S / I N H A B I T A N T S / STUDENTS
Regardless of whether you are a registered voter, you are
qualified to serve if you are a resident of a county OR an
inhabitant of a county for more than 50% of the time.
Examples:
(1) Students who study in Massachusetts
(inhabitants) must serve, even if they are residents of
another state;
Students who live in one
Massachusetts county (residents) but study in another
(inhabitants) can be summoned to serve in either county;
(3) Massachusetts residents who study out of state must
serve in their home county when they return to
Massachusetts.

young children. Only a judge can excuse you from service

ship, you must report to the courthouse on your scheduled
date of service and speak with a judge. Remember: you
can postpone your service for up to a year to minimize
conflicts with your academic schedule, childcare respon-
sibilities, or other personal issues.

S E L F - E M P L O Y E D
There are no occupational exemptions from jury service.
Everyone is eligible, including the self-employed. Only a
judge can excuse you from service for hardship. If you are
seeking to be excused for hardship, you must report to
the courthouse on your scheduled date of service and
speak with a judge. You can request a deferment of your
service to minimize conflicts with your schedule.
