Q U A L I F I C A T I O N S

To be a juror, you must be a U.S.
citizen, 18 years of age or older, and speak
and understand English. 

You must live in the county in which you
have been called to serve, and you cannot
have served in the last 3 years.

Please review the
Reasons For Disqualification
on the back for more information.
CALL BEFORE REPOR TIN G FOR SERVICE
Your Reminder Notice will instruct you to call the Juror Line
at  your  court  on  the  day  before  your  service,  to  learn  if
you  must  report.    Unless  the  Juror  Line  states  that  your
group is cancelled, you must appear as scheduled, resched-
ule online, or call the Office of Jury Commissioner at 1-800-
THE-JURY  (843-5879).    If  you  appear  without  calling,  and
your service was cancelled, you will not get credit for serv-
ing.

P O S T P O N E M E N T
You may postpone your date of service to any available day
up to a year from your original date.  You can select your
own date online and be confirmed immediately. You can
also request a date at #4 on the Juror Confirmation Form: if
the date you select is unavailable, you will be scheduled for
the next available court date. You should choose a date no
more  than  11  months  from  your  original  date,  in  case  you
must postpone again.

H A R D S H I P T R A N S F E R
If necessary, you can request a hardship transfer to another
court within your county.  You must have a serious hardship
that  prevents  you  from  appearing  at  your  original  court.
Inconvenience  and  distance are  not  eligible  hardships.
Briefly  explain  your  hardship  online,  or  at  #3  on  the  Juror
Confirmation Form.

M A P & D I R E C T I O N S
You will receive a map and directions to the courthouse about
ten days before you are to serve.  Maps, directions, and other
information about your courthouse are also available online.

C O M P E N S A T I O N
By  law,  your  Massachusetts  employer  must  pay  you  for
work hours you miss during the first three days of jury serv-
ice.  This applies to all employees:  full-time, part-time, tem-
porary  and  casual.    Failure  to  compensate  employees  is  a
crime.  From the fourth day on, the Commonwealth pays all
jurors  $50  per  day.    Some  employers  will  continue  to  pay
wages to seated jurors even after the third day: check with
your employer.

N I G H T S H I F T W O R K E R S
Night shift workers cannot be required to work past midnight
of  the  night  before  their  first  day  of  jury  service.    You  also
cannot be required to work if you are impaneled on a trial.
You cannot be required to work on your last day of service if
you are released by the court after 4 pm.

R E S I D E N T S / I N H A B I T A N T S / STUDENTS
Regardless  of  whether  you  are  a  registered  voter,  you  are
qualified  to  serve  if  you  are  a  resident  of  a  county  OR  an
inhabitant  of  a  county  for  more  than  50%  of  the  time.
Examples:    (1)    Students  who  study  in  Massachusetts
(inhabitants) must serve, even if they are residents of anoth-
er state;  (2)  Students who live in one Massachusetts coun-
ty (residents) but study in another (inhabitants) can be sum-
moned  to  serve  in  either  county;    (3)    Massachusetts  resi-
dents who study out of state must serve in their home coun-
ty when they return to Massachusetts.

S T U D E N T S / P A R E N T S / C H I L D C A R E
There are no exemptions from jury service.  Everyone is eli-
gible,  including  students  and  parents  of  young  children.
Only a judge can excuse you from service for hardship.
If
you are seeking to be excused for hardship, you must report
to  the  courthouse  on  your  scheduled  date  of  service  and
speak  with  a  judge.    Remember:    you  can  postpone  your
service to minimize conflicts with your academic schedule,
childcare responsibilities, or other personal issues.

H E A L T H
If  you  are  ill  or  disabled,  you  may  postpone  your  service,
transfer to an accessible location, or request a disqualifica-
tion  by  providing  a  doctor's  certification.    See  REASONS
FOR  DISQUALIFICATION,  REASON  9  on  the  other  side  of
this brochure.

YOU CAN RESPOND TO THE JUROR CONFIRMATION FORM ONLINE at

www.MAjury.gov

A G E
If you are 70 or older, you may choose to serve or not.  If you
choose not to serve, please complete the Juror Confirmation
Form  online,  or  by  mail  as  follows:    #2A:  fill  in  Circle  2.
#2B: provide your date of birth. #7: sign your name, and
mail.  If you are under 18, follow the same procedure but fill
in Circle 3.

S E L F - E M P L O Y E D
There  are  no  occupational  exemptions  from  jury  service.
Everyone  is  eligible,  including  the  self-employed.    Only  a
judge can excuse you from service for hardship.  If you are
seeking to be excused for hardship, you must report to the
courthouse  on  your  scheduled  date  of  service  and  speak
with a judge.  You can postpone, but self-employment does
not qualify you for a hardship transfer.

F E L O N Y C O N V I C T I O N
If you have been convicted of a felony within the last 7 years,
or are currently charged with a felony, or are presently in the
custody  of  a  correctional  institution,  please  see  REASONS
FOR  DISQUALIFICATION,  REASON 7  on  the  other  side  of
this brochure. If you were convicted more than 7 years ago,
you are eligible to serve.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
