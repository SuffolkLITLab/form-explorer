      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE GUIDELINES WORKSHEET
FOR THE 2017 CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES

The “recipient” is the person who will receive child support.

The “payor” is the person who will pay child support.

Enter all income and expense amounts as weekly amounts.  

General Information

To change a yearly amount to a weekly amount, divide the yearly amount by 52.

To change a monthly amount to a weekly amount, multiply the monthly amount by 12 and then divide that number by 52.

To change a semi-monthly (twice per month) amount to a weekly amount, multiply the semi-monthly amount by 24 
and then divide that number by 52.

To change a bi-weekly (every other week) amount to a weekly amount, divide the bi-weekly amount by 2.

Round all amounts to the nearest dollar or whole percentage.

The only official electronic version of the Child Support Guidelines and the Guidelines Worksheet ("Worksheet") can be found at 
www.mass.gov/courts.  Any other version of the Worksheet is not endorsed by the Massachusetts Trial Court.  It is STRONGLY 
recommended to fill out the electronic version of the Worksheet on the mass.gov/court website rather than manually, as the 
electronic version automatically calculates most numbers in the Worksheet and is easier to complete.

The support amount for one child can be

Detailed Instructions

Calculation

For each column, divide Line 2(f) by Line 
2(g).  Then to get the percentage for each 
column, multiply that number by 100 and 
round to the nearest whole number.  Enter 
that final number in Line 2(h).  

Enter the amount from Line 2(g), unless the 
amount in Line 2(g) is more than $4,808.  If 
the amount in Line 2(g) is more than $4,808, 
enter $4,808 in Line 3(a).
To manually calculate the combined support 
amount for one child, use the amounts and 
percentages in Table A: CHILD SUPPORT 
OBLIGATION SCHEDULE.  Enter the resulting 
amount in Line 3(b).

In the left-hand column of Table B, find the 
row listing the number in Line 1(a).  Then 
follow across to the right, to the column 
listing the number in Line 1(b).  Enter the 
number from the corresponding row and 
column in Line 3(c). 
Multiply the amount in Line 3(b) by the 
number in Line 3(c) and enter that amount 
in Line 3(d).
Multiply the amount in Line 3(d) by the 
percentage in the first column of Line 2(h) 
and enter that amount in Line 3(e).
Subtract Line 3(e) from Line 3(d).  If the 
amount is $25 or more, enter that amount in 
Line 3(f).  If the amount is less than $25, 
enter $25 in Line 3(f).
For each column, add Lines 2(b), 2(c), and 
2(d) and enter that amount in Line 4(a).  
Enter the amount for the recipient in the 
first column and the amount for the payor in 
the second column.

Multiply the amount in the first column of 
Line 4(a) (the recipient's child care and 
health care costs paid) by the percentage in 
the second column of Line 2(h) (the payor's 
share of combined available income) and 
enter that amount in Line 4(b).

Detailed Instructions

Calculation

Multiply the amount in the second column 
of Line 4(a) (the payor's child care and health 
care costs paid) by  the percentage in the 
first column of Line 2(h) (the recipient's 
share of combined available income) and 
enter that amount in Line 4(c).  This amount 
could be a negative number.

Subtract Line 4(c) from Line 4(b) and enter 
that amount in Line 4(d).
If the amounts in Line 4(a) total more than 
$0, multiply Line 3(f) by 0.15 and enter that 
amount in Line 4(e).  Otherwise, enter $0.
If the amount in Line 4(d) is $0 or higher, 
enter the lesser of the amounts in Line 4(d) 
or Line 4(e).  If the amount in Line 4(d) is a 
negative number, enter zero.

If Line 4(d) is a positive number, enter zero 
in Line 4(g).  If Line 4(d) is a negative 
number, enter the value of Line 4(d) as a 
positive number or the value of Line 4(e), 
whichever is less. 
Add Lines 3(f) and 4(f) then subtract Line 
4(g) from that amount.  If that amount is $25 
or more, enter that amount in Line 4(h).  If 
that amount is less than $25, enter $25.

If the amount in the first column of Line 2(f) 
(the recipient's available income) equals $0, 
enter 100 in Line 5(a).  Otherwise, divide 
Line 4(h) by the amount in the first column 
of Line 2(f) (the recipient's available 
income).  Then to get the percentage, 
multiply that number by 100 and round to 
the nearest whole number.  Enter that final 
number in Line 5(a).

Line 5(a)

Line 5(b)

In most cases, the adjustment in Line 5(b) 
will not change the weekly support amount 
shown in Line 4(g).  The adjustment in Line 
5(b) changes the payor's weekly support 
amount only in cases with relatively high-
income recipients and low-income payors.  

Detailed Instructions

Calculation

If Line 5(a) is 10% or more, enter the amount 
from Line 4(h) or $25, whichever is higher.  If 
Line 5(a) is less than 10%, add 10% to the 
percentage in Line 5(a) and multiply that 
percentage by the payor's available income 
in the second column of Line 2(f).  If that 
amount is equal to or greater than $25 but 
less than the amount in Line 4(h), enter it in 
Line 5(b).  Otherwise, enter the amount 
from Line 4(h) or $25, whichever is less.

Fills in automatically.

Line 6(a)

This line is purely informational.  It shows 
the amount of combined available income 
beyond the $4,808 perweek maximum 
amount of income considered under the 
Child Support Guidelines.  See the Child 
Support Guidelines, Section C.

Line 6(b)

This line is purely informational.  It shows 
the shares of available income for the Payor 
and Recipient beyond the $4,808 per week 
maximum considered under the Guidelines.  
See the Child Support Guidelines, Section C.

If the amount of combined available income 
in Line 2(g) is less than $4,808, leave Lines 
6(a) and 6(b) blank.  If the amount of 
combined available income in Line 2(g) is 
greater than $4,808, subtract $4,808 from 
the amount in Line 2(g) and enter that 
amount in Line 6(a).
Multiply Line 6(a) by each column of Line 
2(h) and enter those amounts in each of the 
same columns of Line 6(b).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
