      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS OF AFFIDAVIT OF INDIGENCY  
AND ITS SUPPLEMENT  
 
 

 

A state statute provides that if you cannot pay for court fees or costs, you 
may be able to have the state pay for them.  These instructions describe who is 
 
eligible and how to use this law. 
 

 

Who Is Eligible?  - You are eligible for a waiver, substitution or state 

payment of fees and costs if any one of the following applies to you: 
 

Category (A) You receive public assistance under one of the following 
programs:  Massachusetts Transitional Aid to Families With Dependent Children; 
Massachusetts Emergency Aid to Elderly, Disabled & Children; Federal 
Supplemental Security Income; Massachusetts MassHealth (formerly Medicaid) or 
Massachusetts Veterans Benefits; or  
 

Category (B) Your income, after taxes, does not exceed 125% of the current 
Federal Poverty Line.  This Poverty Line is revised annually, and the current chart 
should be posted in your local courthouse.  If you do not find it there, please ask 
the Clerk=s office where it is or for a copy; or 
 

Category (C) You cannot pay the court fees or costs without depriving 

yourself or those who are dependent on you of the necessities of life, including 
food, shelter and clothing. 

If you are currently confined in prison or jail and do not seek your 

immediate release but are suing a Astate or county agency, official or employee@ 
about something Aarising out of or resulting from a condition of or occurrence 
during confinement,@ and you are seeking court payment of Anormal@ costs (see 
definition below), please get from the Clerk=s office separate forms for prisoners 
which you must complete in order to qualify for a waiver.  You can use the general 
forms for non-prisoners if you are asking the court to pay for Aextra@ fees. 
Regardless of which forms you use you might find the information below useful. 
 

What Fees And Costs are Covered? - All fees and costs (other than 
attorneys fees) involved in the prosecution or defense of  Aany civil, criminal or 
juvenile proceeding or appeal in any court@ are eligible for waiver, substitution or 
payment by the Commonwealth.  When you prepare your application, please 
identify those costs which you need waived or paid for the initial or next steps of 

your court case.  For example, if you are filing a case in court and you need a 
waiver of the court filing fee, prepare an application for waiver of that fee.  If, in 
addition, you need to have a sheriff or other officer serve court process, or you 
need publication of notice, include your estimates of these costs also.  If, at a later 
time, you need waiver or payment of other court costs (such as costs for subpoenas 
of witnesses to hearings, costs of taking depositions of witnesses, etc.) you should 
make a separate application at that time. 
 

The fees and costs which can be waived or paid by the state are divided into 

two categories: 

1)  Normal fees and costs are those that Aa party normally is required to pay in 

order to prosecute or defend the particular type of proceeding.@  They include, for 
example: 

Court filing fees and surcharges, and also appeal fees and surcharges 
Other court fees for issuing or certifying papers or for photocopies. 
Constable or sheriff fees for serving court process, witness subpoenas, or 
other court papers. 
Costs of publishing notices relating to a court action. 

f you are requesting only normal fees and costs, and your affidavit appears regular 
and complete on its face and indicates that you are indigent, the Clerk will allow 
your request immediately Awithout hearing and without the necessity of 
appearance of any party or counsel.@  The Clerk will waive the fees or costs 
completely, order them to be paid by the Commonwealth, or substitute Aan 
alternative means at lower or no cost [that] is substantially equivalent and . . . does 
not materially impair the rights of any party.@  If your affidavit is not regular and 
complete or you do not appear to be indigent, the clerk-magistrate will promptly 
present your request to a Judge for decision within 5 days. The Judge will either 
grant your request without a hearing or you will be notified of a hearing date. 

f you are a prisoner, a Judge will need to act on your application after first 
ordering the facility where you are confined to produce a copy of your canteen 
account for the last six months. You may ask the court to order payment of the cost 
of serving the summons and complaint in the meantime, however, so your case can 
begin. 

2) 

 

Extra fees and costs are those that are Ain addition to those a party is

normally required to pay in order to prosecute or defend [the] case, which result 
when a party employs or responds to a procedure not necessarily required in the 
particular type of proceeding.@  They include, for example: 

Costs of expert testing, examination or testimony 
Cassette copies for indigent parties not represented by a public defender 
Appeal bonds 
 

f you are requesting any extra fees and costs, the Clerk will promptly present your 
request to a Judge for decision within 5 days. The Judge may allow your request 
without a hearing, but will not deny your request without holding a hearing.  In 
reviewing a request for extra fees or costs, the Judge will decide whether the 
document, service or object is reasonably necessary to assure you as effective a 
prosecution, defense or appeal as you would have if you were financially able to 
pay. 
 

ANormal@ and Aextra@ fees and costs do not include attorneys= fees.

 How Do I Apply? - You should complete the Affidavit of Indigency form 

that applies to you.  If you claim eligibility under Category (C) above, you must 
also complete the Supplement to Affidavit of Indigency form.  File your papers 
with the Clerk of the court where your case has been filed (or where you are 
seeking to file it).  Court Clerks must accept your initial court papers when you 
present them, even if you have not then obtained a waiver of the filing fee.  If the 
fee is later waived, the date of filing your court papers will be the day you first 
presented them to the Clerk.   
 

 What is the Federal Poverty Line? - If you want to qualify under 
Category (B) above (income, after taxes, which is less than 125% of the Federal 
Poverty Line), you should consult a chart of these income limits which should be 
posted in your local courthouse.  If you cannot find this chart, go to the Clerk=s 
office and find out where it is or ask to be given or to read a copy.  This Poverty 
Line is increased every year in February or March, and so the court should have an 
up-to-date schedule. 
 

How Do I Estimate the Costs? - There are places on the form where you 

can give the cost (if you know it) or give your best estimate of the cost of the 

particular fee or service that you need.  If you do not know what the cost will be, 
give your best description of what you need.  The court should approve your 
application, if you are otherwise eligible, even though you have not filled in 
complete information about the costs.   
 

What Are the Situations in Which I Can Get a Substitution of a 
Service? - Under the law, a court can order that a different (or substitute) method 
of performing a certain act or service be allowed, rather than a less convenient or 
more expensive one.  For example, in some situations a court might order that 
notice of filing a court action be made by posting in certain locations rather than by 
publishing the notice in a newspaper.  In other situations you may be able to take 
depositions using tape recorders rather than using a more expensive stenographer.  
If you have a request for a substitute method, please ask for it in your application.  
The court may, itself, order a less expensive or easier substitution.  However, the 
judge may order you to pay a partial fee or cost rather than to waive it if you are 
otherwise eligible for waiver or state payment.  

f you are a prisoner bringing an action in Superior Court, you will receive a 
summons and be instructed to serve it with your complaint by certified mail. You 
can ask for permission to use regular mail if paying the cost of certified mail 
presents a hardship. If you are filing a case in another court, you can ask for 
permission to serve by certified or regular mail. 
  

 
Can I Appeal A Denial? - Yes.  If you disagree with any decision of the 
Clerk or Assistant Clerk, you can request a review by the judge.  If you disagree 
with a decision of a Judge, you can appeal to the next court level.  There are short 
deadlines for doing this, so you must act quickly.  Consult the Clerk=s office for 
information about how to do this. 
 

 

Are the Indigent Court Costs Papers That I File in Court Confidential? 

- Yes, these papers are not available to the general public or to any other party in 
the case, but are only available to authorized court personnel and to you and your 
attorney or your other authorized representative.  If you want an authorized 
representative other than your attorney to see or get copies of these documents, you 
should prepare a written consent so that a designated individual will have authority 
to do that.  Any other party to the case, or their authorized representative, does not 
have access to these records unless that party gets a court order giving permission.  
Also, when you file an application or an appeal under the indigent court costs law, 
you are not required to give copies of any of these documents to any other party in 

  I

the case.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
