(A) A claim may be brought against the commonwealth for an erroneous felony conviction resulting in incarceration as provided in this chapter. (B) The class of persons eligible to obtain relief under this chapter shall be limited to the following: - (i) those that have been granted a full pardon pursuant to section 152 of chapter 127, if the governor expressly states in writing his belief in the individual'sinnocence, or (ii) those who have been granted judicial relief by a state court of competent jurisdiction, on grounds which tend to establish the innocence of the individual as setforth in clause (vi) of subsection (C) , and if (a) the judicial relief vacates or reverses the judgment of a felony conviction, and the felony indictment or complaint usedto charge the individual with such felony has been dismissed, or if a new trial was ordered, the individual was not retried and the felony indictment or complaint wasdismissed or a nolle prosequi was entered, or if a new trial was ordered the individual was found not guilty at the new trial; and (b) at the time of the filing of an actionunder this chapter no criminal proceeding is pending or can be brought against the individual by a district attorney or the attorney general for any act associatedwith such felony conviction. (C) In order for an individual to prevail and recover damages against the commonwealth in a cause of action brought under this chapter, the individual mustestablish, by clear and convincing evidence, that: - (i) he is a member of the class of persons defined in subsection (B) ; (ii) he was convicted of an offense classified as a felony; (iii) he did not plead guilty to the offense charged, or to any lesser included offense, unless such guilty plea was withdrawn, vacated or nullified by operation of lawon a basis other than a claimed deficiency in the plea warnings required by section 29 D of chapter 278; (iv) he was sentenced to incarceration for not less than 1 year in state prison or a house of correction as a result of the conviction and has served all or any partof such sentence; (v) he was incarcerated solely on the basis of the conviction for the offense that is the subject of the claim; (vi) he did not commit the crimes or crime charged in the indictment or complaint or any other felony arising out of or reasonably connected to the facts supportingthe indictment or complaint, or any lesser included felony; and (vii) to the extent that he is guilty of conduct that would have justified a conviction of any lesser included misdemeanor arising out of or reasonably connected tofacts supporting the indictment or complaint, that he has served the maximum sentence he would have received for such lesser included misdemeanor and not lessthan one additional year in a prison. (D) The claimant shall attach to his claim certified copies of: the mittimus that shows the claimant's sentence to incarceration and; the warrants necessary to granta pardon pursuant to section 152 of chapter 127 or; criminal case docket entries or documents related thereto in the case of judicial relief.

(F) The commonwealth and any individual filing an action for compensation under this chapter shall have the right to a jury trial on any action so filed. In the interestof doing substantial justice, with regard to weight and admissibility of evidence submitted by the claimant or the commonwealth, the court presiding at a jury waivedtrial shall exercise its discretion by giving due consideration to any difficulties of proof caused by the passage of time, the death or unavailability or witnesses, orother factors not caused by the claimant, or those acting on the claimant's or the commonwealth's behalf. At a jury trial, the court shall consider these same factorsas part of the exercise of its discretion when determining the admissibility and weight of evidence, and the court shall instruct the jury that it may consider the samefactors when it weighs the evidence presented at trial. No evidence proffered by any party shall be excluded on grounds that it was seized or obtained in violationof the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments to the Constitution of the United States, or in violation of Articles 12 or 14 of Part the First of the Constitution of Massachusetts. Section 2. A claimant shall not be entitled to compensation from the commonwealth for any incarceration or portion thereof, which was or will be credited towarda sentence for, or during which the claimant was also serving a concurrent sentence for the conviction of another crime. In those cases in which only a pardon fromthe governor is used to support a pending action against the commonwealth brought under this chapter, the subsequent exercise of the governor's authority to revokesuch pardon pursuant to section 152 of chapter 127 shall immediately negate the validity of any such pending action and the superior court shall immediately issuea summary judgment in favor of the commonwealth on such grounds.

If such victim is unavailable to testify or decides not to testify, his prior recorded testimony, given under oath at a relevant proceeding, shall onlybe admissible after judicial review and determination that such testimony, or portion thereof, may be helpful to the factfinder. The attorney general shall consult withthe appropriate district attorney relative to the merits of such action and, following consultation, shall have discretion to determine whether to proffer as evidenceany documents, records, testimony or other information brought forward to the attorney general by such district attorney in defense of the commonwealth at a timedeemed appropriate by the attorney general.

Any such agency, department or commission so named in the claim shall be entitled to reasonablenotice of the court proceedings pertaining to the possible ordering of such services and shall be given an opportunity to be heard on whether such agency is theappropriate entity to provide such services if so ordered. The court may also include in its judgment an order that entitles any claimant who wishes to apply for andreceive educational services from any state or community college of the commonwealth including, but not limited to, the University of Massachusetts at Amherstand its satellite campuses, a 50 per cent reduction of the tuition and fees applicable to such services at said institutions.
