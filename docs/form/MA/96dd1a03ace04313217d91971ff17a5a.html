      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOLUNTARY ADMINISTRATION WITH OR WITHOUT A WILL  

These general instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice.  Please consult an 
attorney if you have specific questions.  Court staff cannot provide legal advice or assist you with legal decisions.   

GENERAL INFORMATION  

A voluntary administration is a simplified procedure and is available whether or not the decedent left a will.  To be 
eligible for voluntary administration, the following criteria must be met: 

)  The decedent must have been a resident of Massachusetts at the time of death;  

)  The decedent left a probate estate consisting entirely of personal property valued at $25,000 or less (excluding the 

value of a car) regardless of date of death;  

)  Thirty (30) days or more have passed from the date of the decedent’s death; 

  
4)  The petitioner must be an interested person as defined by Massachusetts law (G. L. c. 190B, § 1-201(24)) but does 
not need to be a resident of Massachusetts.  In the case of a person who at the person’s death, was receiving services 
from the Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) or the Division of 
Medical Assistance (DMA), the petitioner may be any person designated to act as a voluntary personal representative 
(“VPR”) of the estate of the person by DMH, DDS or DMA; and   

)  No other proceeding seeking to probate the decedent’s will or appoint a personal representative has been filed. 

lert:  For purposes of filing a voluntary administration, a creditor is NOT an interested person.  If an interested person 

is a minor, the minor’s parents may NOT file on behalf of the minor without prior court authority. 

Note:  A determination of heirs and an adjudication of testacy are made only in a formal probate proceeding.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
