Massachusetts General Laws chapter . 260 or a public or law library for . additional information. . 5. Will I be able to collect from the. defendant? . If you win, the defendant will be . ordered to pay the judgment if he or . . she is financially able to do so. If the . defendant is able to pay and does not . do so, he or she may be held in . . contempt of court and imprisoned or . . assessed additional costs. Note that . . some sources of income and a portion . of any wages will be exempt from any . payment order. . 6. What is the filing fee for a small. claim. ? The filing fee for small claims of $500 . and under is $40. The filing fee for . claims of $501 to $2000 is $50. The . filing fee for claims of $2001 to $5000 . . is $100. The filing fee for claims of . . $5001 to $7000 is $150. The filing fee . for claims of property damage of . more than $7000 arising f. rom an . automobile accident is $150. . 7. What information must I include. in my claim? . . form with the amount you are suing for . and briefly explain your claim. State . . your claim simply but clearly so that . . the defendant can understand why he . or she is being sued. You . must . state specifically any amounts . sought for damages, for multiple . . damages or statutory penalties, for . . the total amount being sought, . . exclusive of any prejudgment interest . . being sought from the court pursuant . . to statute. . It is essential that you have the . . address. If you are suing a business . that is not a corporation, you should . name as the defendant the owner (s) . . doing business (. . trade name. You may obtain their . names from the City or Town Clerk . where the business is located. If you . are suing a business that is a . corporation, you must have its exact . legal name. You can find this . information from the Corporate . . Records Division of the Secretary of . . Room 1712, Boston, MA 02108 (or at . http: //corp. sec. state. ma. us/corp/corpse. arch/corpsearchinput. asp) . . . you must indicate whether or not the . . defendant is on active military duty.

R. html) . If you are unable to determine. whether the defendant is on active. military duty and the defendant fails to. appear, the court may require you to. post a bond or may issue other ord. ers. to protect the rights of the defendant if. he or she is on active military duty. . 8. What are "costs"? . If the plaintiff prevails, or if both sides . settle the claim, the plaintiff may . recover from the defendant as "costs" . the court filing fee. By court order the . . plaintiff may sometimes recover certain . . other costs of bringing the claim. . 9. How is the defendant notified of. the claim? . The defendant is sent a copy of the . "Statement of Claim and Notice of . . Trial" by first class mail. If the . . defendant lives out of state he or she . will be notified by certified mail. Both . types of notices will be provided by the . . court, after the "Statement of Claim . . and Notice of Trial" form is filed. . 10. Will my case go forward if the. defendant has not received notice? . If the Post Office is unable to notify . ("serve") the defendant and the letter is . returned to the court, your case cannot . go forward. If the letter is not returned, . but later shown to have never been . delivered, or to have been sent to the . wrong address, any judgment you . . have received may be vacated. For . . this reason it is crucial that you make . sure that the mailing address entered . for the defendant on the "Statement of . Claim and Notice of Trial" form is . accurate. . 11. . Are attorneys needed in small. claims cou. rt? but there are exceptions. Consult 1. How . do I bring a . small . claims. action? . By filing . a cou. rt form . called . a "Statement . of Claim . and . Notice . of Trial" . and paying . a filing . fee. .

Notice . of Trial" form . can be . found on . the . back . of the . form itself. . For a listing of court . locations by county. , see . The person . or business filing . the claim is . . . business being sued is called . the 2. Where do . I file a small claim? You may bring a small claim in the District . or Boston Municipal Court where the . pe Tersoxtn lives, works, or has a place ofbusiness. You may also bring a small claim concerning the rental of an . . apartment in the District Court or the Boston Municipal Court where the . apartment is located. In the Housing Court, every small claim must be brought . in the Housing Cou rt serving the area . where the apartment or other residence subject to the small claim is located. 3 Which claims can be . brought assmall claims? . Unless your case is based upon property damage sustained in an automobile . accident, it cannot exceed . $7, 000. 00. The . claim may, however, be subject to statutory damages or . . (e. g. , consumer protection . cases or certain landlord/tenant cases) . In those cases, the . base amount may not . exceed $7, 000. 00 even though the . potential award may exceed that amount. 4. Is there a time limit on when I. must bring my small claim? . . . the claim and applies both to small claims . and to regular civil law suits. Generally, a claim . based on . a contract or a consumer protection law must be brought within . 6 years, and a claim resulting from negligence or intentional harm must be . brought within 3 years, ! "#$$%&$#'" (%') %*# ( (#+, - (. // (0%%1, #/%23-%4. . 5%/3%6) 37%. No, but you . may . hire . one . if . you . wish. . You . may . be able . to find . self-. help. resources . at your local . public . library . (libraries. state. ma. us. ) , the Trial . Court . Law Libraries ( or Mass Legal Help (www. Mass Legal Help. org) , 12. When and where do the plaintiff. and the defendant have . to go tocourt? Unless the plaintiff and defendant settle the case before the trial date, both sides must appear in court on . the date the case is scheduled for trial. 13. What if I cannot come to courton the trial date? You should call . or write the person on . the opposing side and ask him or her to agree to postpone ("continue") the case. Continuances should . only be for good reason, such as illness, an emergency, or the unavailability of a witness. If both sides . agree, or if the opposing side does not agree, or if you are unable to reach the person . on the opposing side, you must write the . clerk magistrate of the court to . ask that the court give . you a continuance. Do not wait until the last minute. If the . other side makes a reasonable request for a continuance, it may . save you some inconvenience if you agree . to the request. 14. What if I do not come to courton the trial date? If the plaintiff does . not appear for trial, and the defendant does appear, the court will enter . a judgment for the . defendant. If both the plaintiff and the defendant do . not appear for trial, the . claim will be dismissed. If the defendant does . not appear for . trial, and the plaintiff does appear, the . court will likely enter a default judgment and . order the defendant to pay the amount claimed. The magistrate may ask the . plaintiff to present some . evidence of the claim, even if the defendant is not . present. 15. How should I prepare for trial? It may be helpful to write down ahead of time the . facts of the case . in the order in which they occurred. This will help you organize your thoughts and make a clear presentation of your story. On the trial date, you must bring . with you any witnesses, checks, bills, . papers, photographs or letters that w. ill help you prove your case. If you are . submitting documents as exhibits at . trial, bring copies for the magistrate . and for the defendant. If you need a . . witness to come to court but the . witness will not come, ask the clerk- . magistrate's office for a witnes. s summons which you must then . arrange to have a constable or deputy . sheriff deliver to the witness. You may . need an expert witness to prove any . matter not within common experience. . . The laws governing small claims are . the same as those for major lawsuits, . except that simplified procedures are . used. The plaintiff must prove that the . claim is one which the law recognizes . and that the defendant is liable, or the . magistrate will enter a decision for the . defendant. . 16. What will happen on the day of. the trial? . Be sure to arrive on time. If your case . is not resolved by a mediator, a trial . will be held before a magistrate. The . plaintiff will be asked to tell his or her . side of the story, then the defendant . . will tell his or her side. Each will have . an opportunity to ask questions of the . other side and the other side's . witnesses. To prevail, the law requires . the plaintiff to prove the validity of his . or her claim. . 17. What if one of the parties wants. a continuance? . If both parties are present when the . case is called, the case will go forward . unless there is good cause for a . continuance. If you are ready to go . forward and the other party wants a . . continuance, make sure you inform the . magistrate if you object. . 18. What will the magistrate do? . The magistrate will make a decision. . Notice of the decision (called a . "judgment") will be given or sent to . each side. . . . Office of Court . Management.
