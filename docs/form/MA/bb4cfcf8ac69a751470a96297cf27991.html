      <pre>Small Claims in Massachusetts:  What You Need to Know 

1.  How do I bring a small claims 
action?

By filing a court form called a 
"Statement of Claim and Notice of 
Trial" and paying a filing fee. The form 
is available in the clerk's office of any 
of the district, Boston municipal, or 
housing courts. Instructions on 
completing a "Statement of Small 
Claim and Notice of Trial" form can be 
found on the back of the form itself. 
For a listing of court locations by county, 
see http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/
courthouses/courthouses-by-county-
gen.html . The person or business filing 
the claim is called the “plaintiff.”  The 
person or business being sued is called 
the 
“defendant."  

2.  Where do I file a small claim?
 
You may bring a small claim in the District 
or Boston Municipal Court where the 
peTersoxtn lives, works, or has a place of 
business.  You may also bring a small 
claim concerning the rental of an 
apartment in the District Court or the 
Boston Municipal Court where the 
apartment is located.  In the Housing 
Court, every small claim must be brought 
rt serving the area       
in the Housing Cou 
                                            
where the apartment or other residence 
subject to the small claim is located.   

3  Which claims can be brought as 
small claims? 

Unless your case is based upon property 
damage sustained in an automobile 
accident, it cannot exceed 
$7,000.00. The claim may, however, 
be subject to statutory damages or 
attorney’s fees in excess of $7,000.00 
(e.g., consumer protection cases or 
certain landlord/tenant cases).  
In those cases, the base amount may not 
exceed $7,000.00 even though the 
potential award may exceed that amount. 

Is there a time limit on when I must 

4. 
bring my small claim?

Yes. The time limit (called the “statute of 
limitations”) varies with the nature of the 
claim and applies both to small claims and 
to regular civil law suits. Generally, a claim 
based on a contract or a consumer 
protection law must be brought within 6 
years, and a claim resulting from 
negligence or intentional harm must be 
brought within 3 years, 

but there are exceptions. Consult
Massachusetts General Laws chapter 
260 or a public or law library for 
additional information.  

5. Will I be able to collect from the
defendant?

If you win, the defendant will be 
ordered to pay the judgment if he or 
she is financially able to do so. If the 
defendant is able to pay and does not 
do so, he or she may be held in 
contempt of court and imprisoned or 
assessed additional costs. Note that 
some sources of income and a portion 
of any wages will be exempt from any 
payment order. 

6. What is the filing fee for a small
claim?

The filing fee for small claims of $500 
and under is $40. The filing fee for 
claims of $501 to $2000 is $50. The 
filing fee for claims of $2001 to $5000 
is $100. The filing fee for claims of 
$5001 to $7000 is $150. The filing fee 
for claims of property damage of  
more than $7000 arising from an 
automobile accident is $150. 

7. What information must I include
in my claim?

Fill in the “Statement of Small Claim” 
form with the amount you are suing for 
and briefly explain your claim. State 
your claim simply but clearly so that 
the defendant can understand why he 
or she is being sued. You  
must  state specifically any amounts 
sought for damages, for multiple 
damages or statutory penalties, for 
attorney’s fees, or for costs, as well as 
the total amount being sought, 
exclusive of any prejudgment interest 
being sought from the court pursuant 
to statute. 

It is essential that you have the 
defendant’s correct name and mailing 
address. If you are suing a business 
that is not a corporation, you should 
name as the defendant the owner(s) 
doing business (“d/b/a”) under that 
trade name. You may obtain their 
names from the City or Town Clerk 
where the business is located. If you 
are suing a business that is a 
corporation, you must have its exact 
legal name. You can find this 
information from the Corporate 
Records Division of the Secretary of 
State’s Office, One Ashburton Place, 

Room 1712, Boston, MA 02108 (or at 
http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpse
arch/corpsearchinput.asp).  

In the “MILITARY AFFIDAVIT” portion, 
you must indicate whether or not the 
defendant is on active military duty. If 
you know the defendant’s social 
security number, you may determine 
whether he or she is on active military 
duty online at 
https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/scra/scr
aHome.do; otherwise, you must write 
to the appropriate military service 
headquarters (listed at 
www.defenselink.mil/faq/pis/PC09SLD
R.html). If you are unable to determine
whether the defendant is on active
military duty and the defendant fails to
appear, the court may require you to
post a bond or may issue other orders
to protect the rights of the defendant if
he or she is on active military duty.

8. What are "costs"?

If the plaintiff prevails, or if both sides 
settle the claim, the plaintiff may 
recover from the defendant as "costs" 
the court filing fee. By court order the 
plaintiff may sometimes recover certain 
other costs of bringing the claim.  

9. How is the defendant notified of
the claim?

The defendant is sent a copy of the 
"Statement of Claim and Notice of 
Trial" by first class mail. If the 
defendant lives out of state he or she 
will be notified by certified mail. Both 
types of notices will be provided by the 
court, after the "Statement of Claim 
and Notice of Trial" form is filed. 

10. Will my case go forward if the
defendant has not received notice?

If the Post Office is unable to notify 
("serve") the defendant and the letter is 
returned to the court, your case cannot 
go forward. If the letter is not returned, 
but later shown to have never been 
delivered, or to have been sent to the 
wrong address, any judgment you 
have received may be vacated. For 
this reason it is crucial that you make 
sure that the mailing address entered 
for the defendant on the "Statement of 
Claim and Notice of Trial" form is 
accurate.  

11. Are attorneys needed in small
claims court?

Institute.  

with you any witnesses, checks, bills, 
papers, photographs or letters that will 
help you prove your case. If you are 
submitting documents as exhibits at 
trial, bring copies for the magistrate 
and for the defendant. If you need a 
witness to come to court but the 
witness will not come, ask the clerk- 
magistrate's office for a witness 
summons which you must then 
arrange to have a constable or deputy 
sheriff deliver to the witness. You may 
need an expert witness to prove any 
matter not within common experience. 
The laws governing small claims are 
the same as those for major lawsuits, 
except that simplified procedures are 
used. The plaintiff must prove that the 
claim is one which the law recognizes 
and that the defendant is liable, or the 
magistrate will enter a decision for the 
defendant.  

16. What will happen on the day of
the trial?

Be sure to arrive on time. If your case 
is not resolved by a mediator, a trial 
will be held before a magistrate. The 
plaintiff will be asked to tell his or her 
side of the story, then the defendant 
will tell his or her side. Each will have 
an opportunity to ask questions of the 
other side and the other side's 
witnesses. To prevail, the law requires 
the plaintiff to prove the validity of his 
or her claim. 

17. What if one of the parties wants
a continuance?

If both parties are present when the 
case is called, the case will go forward 
unless there is good cause for a 
continuance. If you are ready to go 
forward and the other party wants a 
continuance, make sure you inform the 
magistrate if you object.  

18. What will the magistrate do?

The magistrate will make a decision. 
Notice of the decision (called a 
"judgment") will be given or sent to 
each side. 

No, but you may hire one if you wish. 
You may be able to find self-help 
resources at your local public library 
(libraries.state.ma.us),  the Trial Court 
Law Libraries 
(http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-
legal-res/law-lib/) or MassLegal Help 
(www.MassLegalHelp.org), 

12.  When and where do the plaintiff 
and the defendant have to go to 
court?

Unless the plaintiff and defendant 
settle the case before the trial date, 
both sides must appear in court on the 
date the case is scheduled for trial. 

13.  What if I cannot come to court 
on the trial date?

You should call or write the person on 
the opposing side and ask him or her to 
agree to postpone ("continue") the 
case. Continuances should only be for 
good reason, such as illness, an 
emergency, or the unavailability of a 
witness. If both sides agree, or if the 
opposing side does not agree, or if you 
are unable to reach the person on the 
opposing side, you must write the clerk 
magistrate of the court to ask that the 
court give you a continuance. Do not 
wait until the last minute. If the other 
side makes a reasonable request for a 
continuance, it may save you some 
inconvenience if you agree to the 
request. 

14.  What if I do not come to court 
on the trial date?

If the plaintiff does not appear for trial, 
and the defendant does appear, the 
court will enter a judgment for the 
defendant. If both the plaintiff and the 
defendant do not appear for trial, the 
claim will be dismissed. If the 
defendant does not appear for trial, and 
the plaintiff does appear, the court will 
likely enter a default judgment and 
order the defendant to pay the amount 
claimed. The magistrate may ask the 
plaintiff to present some evidence of 
the claim, even if the defendant is not 
present. 

15.  How should I prepare for trial?

It may be helpful to write down ahead 
of time the facts of the case in the 
order in which they occurred. This will 
help you organize your thoughts and 
make a clear presentation of your story. 
On the trial date, you must bring
