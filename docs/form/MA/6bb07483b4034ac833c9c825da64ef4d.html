Date: 

Subject: 

Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land 
Titles 

THIS MEMORANDUM SUPERSEDES PREVIOUS MEMO DATED OCTOBER 13, 2012 

Section I. General Information 

The Land Court Guidelines, first promulgated in May of 2000, and revised on February 
27, 2009, include Land Court Guideline 14. Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land 
Titles.  Guideline 14 has been supplemented with Memos from the Chief Title Examiner in order 
to reflect the changes resulting from the enactment of the Massachusetts Uniform Probate Code, 
G.L. c. 190B et seq., with an effective date of March 31, 2012 (“MUPC”), as amended.  Until
such time as Land Court Guideline 14 is revised by the Court, this Memorandum should be
consulted when dealing with the death of any registered land owner(s).

The purpose of this guideline is to assist lawyers in dealing with title to Registered Land 

upon the death of a registered owner.  The methods outlined herein are generally speaking, 
mutually exclusive: 

A)

B)

C)

D)

METHOD NO. 1 - DEATH OF ONE TENANT BY THE ENTIRETY OR DEATH OF
ANY NUMBER OF JOINT TENANTS BUT THE LAST

METHOD NO. 2 - COMPLAINT FOR CERTIFICATE AFTER DEATH (LAND
COURT ORDER)

METHOD NO. 3 - SALE UNDER DECREE (LICENSE) OF PROBATE COURT

METHOD NO. 4 - DEED UNDER POWER OF SALE IN WILL

Note: Reference to “LCP-2 Petition” has been replaced by “Complaint for Certificate After 
Death,” revised as of the date of this Memorandum (also referred to herein as “Complaint”). 

Note: The revised Complaint is to be utilized in all applicable cases as set forth herein.  The 
revised Complaint is available on our website (www.mass.gov/lists/land-court-forms). 

Memorandum Re: Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land Titles (revised 10-2019) 

Page 1 of 8 

Note: To include additional facts or in a case involving more than one death, please attach an 
Addendum explaining the situation, along with the relevant supporting documentation. 
(Reference to an Addendum is found on Page 1 of the Complaint.) 

Note: The Land Court will require, for registered land, FORMAL probate proceedings for a 
Complaint for Certificate After Death whether they are testate or intestate.  This will be further 
explained below under Method No. 2. 

Note: For DEED APPROVALS from probate estates, we will accept a Decree (license) or the 
use of the power of sale conferred in a will probated in either informal or formal probate 
proceedings.  The requirements under Method Nos. 3 and 4 will be discussed more fully herein.  

Section II. Methods 

A)

METHOD NO. 1 - DEATH OF ONE TENANT BY THE ENTIRETY OR DEATH OF
ANY NUMBER OF JOINT TENANTS BUT THE LAST

Because title to land passes in such situations by operation of law to the surviving co-
tenant(s) by right of survivorship, it is unnecessary for the surviving owner(s) to obtain a new 
Certificate of Title or Memorandum of Unit Ownership (reference throughout this Memorandum 
to Certificate of Title also includes Memorandum of Unit Ownership) in order to deal with the 
property.  It is necessary, however, that evidence of the death be noted on the encumbrance sheet 
of the outstanding Certificate of Title as follows:  

(1)

(2)

A certified copy of a death certificate of the deceased owner.

If the deceased owner was a tenant by the entirety, an Affidavit of No Divorce.

Once the above-referenced documents are registered, the surviving registered owner(s) 

may deal with the property freely, without Land Court approval. 

However, if the surviving registered owner(s) request(s) a Certificate of Title in their 

name(s), a Subsequent Complaint must be filed with the Land Court Department, along with the 
statutory filing fee, the material referred to under Subsections 1 and 2 above (as applicable), as 
well as an attested copy of the outstanding Certificate of Title.  If the Certificate of Title has not 
been prepared, provide an attested copy of the deed(s) into the current owner, and an attested 
copy of the most recent prior Certificate of Title.  There is no court-promulgated form which 
must be used.  The surviving registered owner(s) must simply recite, under oath, the 
circumstances, request the cancellation of the outstanding Certificate of Title, and request the 
issuance of a new Certificate of Title in their name(s). An Order of the Land Court will issue and 
must be presented at the Registry of Deeds for registration.

Page 2 of 8 

B)  METHOD NO. 2 - COMPLAINT FOR CERTIFICATE AFTER DEATH (LAND 

COURT ORDER)   

Method No. 2 is used to obtain a new Certificate of Title after the death of a person in 
whose name alone a Certificate of Title stands, after the death of both tenants by the entirety, 
after the death of one tenant in common, or after the death of the last joint tenant.  For this 
method, the Complaint for Certificate After Death must be filed, and the lawyer for Plaintiff(s) 
or a Land Court Examiner will file the following to initiate a case:  

(1) 

(2) 

File the completed Complaint along with the statutory filing fee.  Note that this 
Complaint has two signature sections.  The statement in the section entitled 
“Waiver of Notice by Personal Representative” is to be signed by the Personal 
Representative of the estate.  If no Personal Representative has been appointed, 
one heir (intestate estate) or devisee (testate estate) must sign the Complaint.   
 
As provided for in the Complaint, all Plaintiffs, or the lawyer for the Plaintiff(s), 
will also sign the Complaint in the applicable section entitled “Listing of All 
Plaintiffs.”  

Note: If the lawyer signs the Complaint, the lawyer should make clear that they represent 
the Plaintiff(s).  If the lawyer represents less than all of the Plaintiffs, those Plaintiffs 
must also sign the Complaint, or provide the Court with a separate written Assent to the 
Complaint. 

(3)   An attested copy of the outstanding Certificate of Title must be filed.  If the 

Certificate of Title has not been prepared, provide an attested copy of the deed(s) 
into the current owner, and an attested copy of the most recent, prior Certificate of 
Title. 

(4)  

Supporting documentation will vary depending upon how title to the property was 
held: 

 

(a) 

Tenancy by the Entirety/Joint Tenancy - all Co-Tenants Deceased 

(i) 

as to the first to die, a death certificate.  If there are more than two 
joint tenants, a death certificate must be filed for each deceased 
registered land owner (except the last to die).  In addition, if the 
property was held as tenants by the entirety, an Affidavit of No 
Divorce must be filed.  

Note: The Affidavit of No Divorce must address the fact that at the time of 
death of the first to die, there had been no divorce.   

Memorandum Re: Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land Titles (revised 10-2019) 

Page 3 of 8 

(ii) 

as to the surviving tenant by the entirety or the last joint tenant to 
die, file attested Probate and Family Court copies of the following 
(as applicable): 

TABLE 1 – Attested Probate and Family Court documents  
Docket Sheet 
Allowed Petition (pre-MUPC) or Petition for Formal (MPC 160) 
Citation (and a copy of the publication) 
Approved Bond(s) 
Will (if testate) and all Codicils (if any) 
Inventory (if filed) 
Surviving Spouse, Children, Heirs at Law Form (MPC 162) (if filed) 
Devisees Form (MPC 163) (if testate and filed) 
Decree and Order on Petition for Formal Adjudication (MPC 755)  
(unless the Probate and Family Court Decree is otherwise part of a Pre-MUPC filing) 

 

TABLE 2 – Attested Probate and Family Court documents needed only if filed 
Petition for Late and Limited Formal Testacy and/or Appointment (MPC 161) 
Decree and Order on Petition for Late and Limited Formal Testacy and/or 
Appointment (MPC 757) 

Petition for Order of Complete Settlement (MPC 855) 
First and Final Account (include all Accounts if more than one) 
Decree and Order for Complete Settlement (MPC 790) 

Note: If any of the Probate and Family Court documents in the Tables 
were amended, attested copies will also be required.   

Note: Lawyers may not attest these documents.   

Note: If the opening proceeding was an informal probate, and the time 
limits prescribed in G.L. c. 190B, § 3-108, have not expired, you may 
either institute a Formal Probate, or in the alternative, you may petition the 
Probate and Family Court for a Decree and Order for Complete 
Settlement.  The Petition for Order of Complete Settlement (MPC 855) 
must specifically seek a determination of testacy and heirs.  This Petition 
for Order of Complete Settlement is a formal probate proceeding, and will 
result in a Decree and Order for Complete Settlement (MPC 790).  Please 
follow up with the Probate and Family Court regarding this process. 

If the time limits prescribed in G.L. c. 190B, § 3-108, have expired, then 
an Addendum addressing this issue is to be included along with the 

 

Memorandum Re: Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land Titles (revised 10-2019) 

Page 4 of 8 

Complaint, with the relevant supporting documentation.  (Reference to the 
Addendum is found on Page 1 of the Complaint.) 

Note: A determination of heirs is not established as a result of the time 
limits under G.L. c. 190B, § 3-108.  This must be determined by the 
Probate and Family Court in either a testate or intestate estate, and 
submitted as part of the Complaint to the Land Court.  Please follow up 
with the Probate and Family Court regarding this process.   

(b) 

Tenancy in Common - for each tenant in common who is deceased, file all 
of the materials set forth in the preceding Tables (as applicable).  If there 
are surviving tenants in common, each should assent to the Complaint by 
signing it to indicate that they are aware that the old Certificate of Title is 
to be cancelled, and a new Certificate of Title is to be issued in their 
name(s) as well as the name(s) of the new tenant(s) in common.   

Note: If a surviving tenant in common does not sign the Complaint, a separate 
written Assent can be filed.  

(c) 

Certificate Standing in the Name of One Person - again, file attested 
Probate and Family Court Division copies of all probate documentation 
for the estate of the decedent as set forth in the preceding Tables (as 
applicable).   

The result of this method will be an attested Order of the Land Court which must be 

registered at the Land Registration Office at the proper Registry of Deeds. In due course, a new 
Certificate of Title will be drawn in accordance with the Order of the Land Court.   

Note: Deeds of Distribution: The Land Court will NOT accept, in lieu of the Complaint, a deed 
from the Personal Representative to the heirs or devisees under the will of the decedent, or to 
their nominee.  If acceptance of a deed from a Personal Representative is requested, it may be 
registered in connection with a Court Order, but only if the Complaint is based on a formal 
decree that allows the issuance of a Certificate of Title to the heirs or devisees.   

Note: 

DEBTS: 

As to decedents dying on or after January 1, 1990, claims of creditors are 
generally barred after one year from the date of decedent’s death.  

 

 

Different rules may apply to those decedents dying before January 1, 1990. 

TAXES: 

Estate and inheritance taxes are not required to be noted on Certificates of Title 
(G.L.c. 185, § 46; See also Land Court Guideline 35).  

Memorandum Re: Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land Titles (revised 10-2019) 

Page 5 of 8 

LEGACIES:  Unless the real property is specifically devised, if a will directs the payment of 

legacies, the Land Court requires evidence of their payment.  

 

Note: If less than one year has elapsed since the date of death, or if there are 
claims on the estate, any new Certificate of Title will issue subject to the 
settlement of the estate. 

Note: If a new Certificate of Title issues subject to the settlement of the estate, a 
further Subsequent Complaint to Amend the Certificate of Title, together with 
applicable supporting documentation, is required to remove the settlement of the 
estate language from the face of the new Certificate of Title.   

DEVISE TO A TRUST:  

A) Testamentary Trust: If property is devised to the Trustees of a testamentary trust, 

 
attested copies of the Decree appointing the Trustee or the Statement of Confirmation of 
Testamentary Trustee and the Trustee’s Bond(s) must be included, along with the 
aforementioned probate documentation under Method No. 2 (set forth in the preceding Tables, as 
applicable).  The Order of Court will issue to the testamentary Trustee(s) for the benefit of the 
named beneficiary(ies) of said testamentary trust, under the will of the decedent.  

B) Inter Vivos Trust: If property is devised to the Trustees of an inter vivos trust, which is 

 
not of record, the original trust instrument and any amendment(s) thereto, or a Certificate 
pursuant to G.L. c. 184, § 35, must be filed with the Land Court in connection with the 
Complaint, along with the aforementioned probate documentation under Method No. 2, (set forth 
in the preceding Tables, as applicable).  The Order of Court will issue to the trustee(s), and the 
original trust document(s) or the aforementioned Certificate will be registered, and noted on the 
new Certificate of Title issued.  Please note that we will not place title into an expired trust (See 
also Land Court Guideline 62. Trusts: Expired). 

C)  METHOD NO. 3 - SALE UNDER DECREE (LICENSE) OF PROBATE COURT 

Method No. 3 is an alternative to Method No. 2, and is used when an immediate sale is 

contemplated.  One of the advantages of obtaining a Probate and Family Court Decree (“Decree” 
or “license”) is that the property will be sold free of debts of the deceased, costs of 
administration, legacies, and Massachusetts estate taxes, a tax release being a prerequisite for 
obtaining the Decree/license.  

If utilizing Method No. 3, please present all of the following for a DEED APPROVAL: 

(1)  

The original or an attested copy of the Decree/license (no more than one year old) 
containing the property description;  

(2)   An attested copy of the Probate and Family Court Docket Sheet; 

Memorandum Re: Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land Titles (revised 10-2019) 

Page 6 of 8 

(3) 

An attested copy of the Decree and Order on Petition For Formal Adjudication 
(MPC 755) or  Order of Informal Probate of Will and/or Appointment of Personal 
Representative (MPC 750); 

(4)   An attested copy of the outstanding Certificate of Title must be presented.  If the 
Certificate of Title has not been prepared, provide an attested copy of the deed(s) 
into the current owner, and an attested copy of the most recent prior Certificate of 
Title; and 

(5) 

A fully executed deed must be presented.  The deed is to be signed and 
acknowledged by the Personal Representative in their representative capacity. 

Example Grantor Clause: 

“I, _____________as Personal Representative of the Estate of _____________holder of a 
Decree of the Probate and Family Court of ________dated,________ Docket No. 
###########, by power conferred by said Decree. . .” 

Note: The date of the Decree/license referenced in the deed must be the date that the 
Decree/license issued.  The deed must conform in all respects to the Decree/license, with the 
consideration equal to or more than the amount specified in the Decree/license.  The deed should 
be executed on or after the date of the Decree/license. 

Note: The property description in the deed must conform to the description in the Decree/license.   

Note: If the Personal Representative is the grantee in the deed, the Decree/license of the Probate 
and Family Court must provide that the Personal Representative is permitted to take title.  

If everything is in order, the deed pursuant to the Decree/license is endorsed “Approved 

for Registration” and signed by a Land Court Title Examiner. 

D)  METHOD NO. 4 - DEED UNDER POWER OF SALE IN WILL 

Method No. 4 is an alternative to Method No. 2, and is used when an immediate sale is 

contemplated.  The advantage of a sale pursuant to a power of sale in a will is that the property is 
sold free of debts of the deceased, costs of administration and legacies. The power of sale can be 
used to convey registered land when the will, probated formally or informally, empowered the 
personal representative to sell the real estate or an interest in that real estate.  It is not to be 
used to distribute the registered land to the devisees or heirs at law, nor is it to be used to 
effectuate an agreement amongst the devisees as to which of them will take title.  

If utilizing Method No. 4, please present all of the following for a DEED APPROVAL: 

(1) 

An attested copy of the probated will (and all codicils) must be presented at the 
Land Court.  To use this method, the power of sale in the will must be 
unequivocal.  The clause containing the power should be marked; 

Memorandum Re: Land Court Guideline 14.  Death: The Effect of Death upon Registered Land Titles (revised 10-2019) 

Page 7 of 8 

(2)

(3)

(4)

Attested Probate and Family Court copies of the Docket Sheet, Petition for 
Formal (MPC 160) or Petition for Informal Probate of Will and/or Appointment 
of Personal Representative (MPC 150), Approved Bond(s), Surviving Spouse, 
Children, Heirs at Law Form (MPC 162), Devisees Form (MPC 163), and Decree 
and Order on Petition For Formal Adjudication (MPC 755) or  Order of Informal 
Probate of Will and/or Appointment of Personal Representative (MPC 750). 
Along with the foregoing, provide current Letters of Authority of the Personal 
Representative, issued from the Probate Court (not more than 60 days old).

An attested copy of the outstanding Certificate of Title must be presented.  If the 
Certificate of Title has not been prepared, provide an attested copy of the deed(s) 
into the current owner, and an attested copy of the most recent prior Certificate of 
Title;

The fully executed deed of the Personal Representative must be presented. The 
grantor clause should clearly state that the Personal Representative is selling 
pursuant to the power conferred by the probated will of the deceased owner.  The 
consideration in the deed must be other than nominal, and must be in favor of 
an arm’s length third party (See G.L. c. 190B, § 3-715 23 ½); and

Example Grantor Clause: 

“I, __________________ as Personal Representative of the Estate of _________________, 
pursuant to the power of sale conferred under the probated will, Probate and Family Court, 
Docket No. ###########. . .” 

(5)

The deed is to be signed and acknowledged by the Personal Representative in
their representative capacity.

If everything is in order, the deed, pursuant to power of sale in the probated will is 

endorsed “Approved for Registration” and is signed by a Land Court Title Examiner. 

Note:  With Method Nos. 3 and 4, where title was held as tenants by the entirety, or as joint 
tenants, a death certificate and an Affidavit of No Divorce (tenants by the entirety) should be 
presented to the Land Court Title Examiner, along with the Deed.  

In Summary: If a Complaint for Certificate After Death is presented, an Order of the Land 
Court will issue.  If a deed under either a Decree/license or pursuant to the power of sale 
conferred in a probated will is presented, the deed is approved, and no Complaint is necessary.  
This Memorandum is not intended to be exhaustive, and addresses only the most common 
situations.
