The petitioner must give notice of the proceeding as provided in the citation’s Order of Notice.  Review the Order of 
Notice carefully!  The return date listed in the citation is NOT a hearing date.  It is the deadline date by which an 
interested party must file his or her written appearance if he or she wishes to contest the petition.   For more information 
on contesting the allowance of an account or a petition for order of complete settlement, see Chapter 10, section 10.9, et. 
seq., of the MUPC Estate Administration Procedural Guide 2nd Edition. 

n general, notice of the citation (MPC 570) must be provided to all persons interested (who have not assented and waived 
their statutory right to notice in writing) as follows: 

ervice of a citation within Massachusetts shall be given by delivering in hand or by mailing by certified, registered or 

ordinary first class mail at least fourteen (14) days before the return date. 

.  Service within Massachusetts 

.  Service outside of Massachusetts 

f it shall appear from the petition that there is anyone interested who is outside of Massachusetts in any part of the United 
States, its Commonwealths or territories, service of the citation shall be given by delivering in hand or by mailing by 
certified, registered or ordinary first class mail at least fourteen (14) days before the return day; if in other parts, one (1) 
month. 

.  Service when Whereabouts are Unknown

In addition to the service requirements above, publication SHALL be required if a person’s whereabouts, address or 
identity is unknown.  Publication SHALL also be required if a Petition for Order of Complete Settlement requests a 
formal determination of testacy or a formal determination of the decedent’s heirs at law (see Chapter 10, section 
10.6.3 and section 10.6.4 of the MUPC Estate Administration Procedural Guide 2nd Edition).  A copy of the citation 
shall be published once in a newspaper designated by the Register of Probate at least seven (7) days before the return day.   
 

  Return of Service

The petitioner must file with the court proof of notice by filing a copy of the citation with a completed Return of 
Service on or before the return day.  Proof of publication (if any) should be filed. 

  Military Affidavit (MPC 470) 

This form must be filed UNLESS the written assents and waivers of notice (MPC 455) of all interested persons 
are filed.  For more information, see the Military Affidavit section found in Chapter 3, section 3.10.2, of the 
MUPC Estate Administration Procedural Guide 2nd Edition.   
 

TEP 6:   ADDITIONAL FORMS THAT MAY BE NEEDED PRIOR TO ALLOWANCE 

  Affidavit of Witness to Will (MPC 480)

This form must be filed if requesting a formal determination of testacy and evidence concerning the execution of 
the will is necessary and this form is not already on file with the court.  For more information, see Chapter 1, 
section 1.14.3, of the MUPC Estate Administration Procedural Guide 2nd Edition.   
 

  Affidavit of Domicile (MPC 485)

This form must be filed if requesting a formal determination of testacy and the address of the decedent is 
incorrectly listed on the death certificate and this form is not already on file with the court.  For more information, 
see Chapter 3, section 3.11.4.2, of the MUPC Estate Administration Procedural Guide 2nd Edition.   

WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT  

  If the petition is uncontested, the court may enter appropriate orders after the return date on the strength of the 
pleadings if satisfied that all conditions are met or the court may conduct a hearing and require proof of the 
matters necessary to support the order sought.

  If the petition is contested, the petitioner must file a Request for a Case Management Conference or other 

applicable form.  The division’s judicial case manager may be consulted for further information regarding the 
scheduling of a hearing date.   

  Once approved or denied, a copy of the formal decree will be provided to the petitioner by mail or in-person. 

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
