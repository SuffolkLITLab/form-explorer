LAND COURT 

DEPARTMENT OF THE TRIAL COURT 

 

 

CHECKLISTS FOR VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF LAND FROM 
THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 
CHAPTER 185, SECTION 52, AS AMENDED 

The Checklists address voluntary withdrawal of both publicly and privately 

owned land from the provisions of G.L. c. 185, § 52.  Since the Land Court 
Guidelines were last updated (as of February 27, 2009), G.L. c. 185, § 52 has been 
amended.  Therefore, until such time as the Land Court Guidelines are further 
updated by the Court, the Checklists set forth herein should serve as guidance 
when filing for voluntary withdrawal pursuant to G.L. c. 185, § 52.    

With all voluntary withdrawals under the statute, a Subsequent Petition 
(commonly referred to as an “S-Petition”) must be filed with the Land Court.  The 
Checklists outlined below, (one addressing publicly owned land and one 
addressing privately owned land) set forth the materials to be submitted and the 
procedures to be followed to process the Subsequent Petition for Voluntary 
Withdrawal. 

 

A. Land owned by the Commonwealth, or an agency, department, board, 

commission or authority of the Commonwealth,  or any political  
subdivision thereof, or any authority of any such political subdivision 
may have their land withdrawn from registration pursuant to the 
following procedures: 
 

1.  The public entity which has acquired the registered land must file a 

Complaint.  This Complaint is to be drafted by the Plaintiff and is not the 
Complaint referred to in the following section dealing with privately owned 
land (and is therefore not the form of Complaint on the Land Court website). 
   

1 
Revised 5/2019 

(a) The Complaint should include a brief description of the public entity, 
including the source, whether statutory or otherwise, of the public 
entity’s designation/authority. 
 

(b) In those cases where the ownership of the land derives from an eminent 
domain taking, and a new Certificate of Title has not issued in the name 
of the public entity, the Complaint may combine the eminent domain 
aspect of the case with the voluntary withdrawal.  As with all eminent 
domain taking Subsequent Petitions, the Complaint must allege 
compliance with all the requirements of Massachusetts General Laws, 
Chapter 79, relative to said taking. 

2.  File (a) an attested copy of the Certificate of Title or (b) if the Certificate of 
Title has not been prepared, an attested copy of the deed(s) into the current 
owner, and a copy of the most recent prior Certificate of Title. 
 

3.  The filing fee for the Subsequent Petition is $50.00. 

 

 

4.  Title examination by a Land Court examiner is required.  The Court will 
appoint an examiner pursuant to SJC Rule 1:07. (Any request for a non- 
sequential appointment in accordance with the Rule must be made at the 
time of filing the Complaint.)  When the Court appoints an examiner, it will 
send the Title Examiner Appointment Letter to Plaintiff’s attorney, who is 
responsible for sending the Title Examiner Appointment Letter to the 
examiner, together with a copy of the Complaint.  
 

5.  The title examination should run from the date of the outstanding Certificate 
of Title and list all of the owners, mortgagees, and lessees, with an address 
for each. 
 

6.  Notice to all mortgagees and lessees of record is required.  If Plaintiff does 
not submit the assents of all mortgagees and lessees, a citation will be 
issued.  Upon receipt of assents from all those entitled to notice, or their 
default, the case will be treated as an uncontested matter, and presented to 
the Court for its consideration.  The Court will determine if further 
submissions or a hearing are required.  If any party notified files an 

2 
Revised 5/2019 

opposition to the Complaint, the case will be treated as a contested case, to 
be resolved according to the penultimate sentence of § 52. 
 

7.  A Court Order will issue for the withdrawal of the land from the provisions 

of Chapter 185.   
 

B. Registered Land owners, other than public entities, who qualify under 
the statute, may have their land withdrawn from registration pursuant 
to the following procedures: 
 

1.  Plaintiffs (all the owners of the property) must file a Complaint for 

Voluntary Withdrawal of Land from the Registration System, signed by 
either the registered owners or their attorney.  The basic form of Complaint 
is available on the Land Court website, but must be augmented with 
allegations and exhibits, as necessary (see below). 

2.  Plaintiffs must file a Notice of Voluntary Withdrawal of Land from the 
Registration System (“Notice of Voluntary Withdrawal”), signed and 
acknowledged by all owners.  The form is available on the Land Court 
website. 

3.  The filing fee for the Subsequent Petition is $50.00. 

4.  File (a) an attested copy of the Certificate of Title or (b) if the Certificate of 
Title has not been prepared, an attested copy of the deed(s) into the current 
owner, and a copy of the most recent prior Certificate of Title. 

 

 

 

 

5.  Plaintiffs may voluntarily withdraw their land under the statute, as 

amended, as follows:  

if at least one of the following is shown: (i) the registered land 
constitutes less than all of the total area of a single parcel or of 2 or 
more contiguous parcels in common ownership; (ii) the registered 
land consists of less than 10 per cent of the portion of the land area to 
which an original certificate of title pertains and the rest of the land 
area to which that certificate pertains was conveyed under this chapter 
since the original registration; (iii) the owners of the registered land 

3 
Revised 5/2019 

have submitted the land or satisfy the court that the owners shall 
submit the land to chapter 183A or 183B or shall create interests in 
the land to which said chapter 183B is applicable under section 3 of 
chapter 760 of the acts of 1987 or satisfy the court that the owners 
shall create those interests; (iv) the owners of the registered land 
establish that the registered land is improved with an occupied 
building not used or occupied as or in connection with, and not 
designed or intended for use or occupancy as or in connection with, a 
1-to-4 family residential dwelling; or (v) the court finds that the 
owners of the registered land have demonstrated other good cause for 
withdrawal under this section including, but not limited to, economic 
hardship by reason of the land being registered which may include the 
burdens and expenses of further dividing the registered land into lots 
for separate conveyance (G.L. c. 185, § 52)  

Sections (i) (contiguous and in common ownership) & (ii) (less 
than 10%) under the statute: 

 

 

 

 

(a)  In cases under sections (i) and (ii) of the statute, Plaintiffs must 

submit proof that their situation falls within the applicable section 
by attaching to the Complaint relevant plans and deeds, which 
support the allegations in the Complaint.  There will be a review 
by the Survey Department of all Complaints filed under sections (i) 
and (ii). (The Court may require a certificate from a registered 
engineer or land surveyor for verification.) 
 

(b)  There is no longer a requirement that registered land constitute less 
than 50% of the total area of a single parcel or of two or more 
contiguous parcels in common ownership.   

Section (iii) (G.L. c. 183A & G.L. c. 183B) under the statute: 

(a) In cases where Plaintiffs allege they have submitted the land to the 
provisions of Chapters 183A or 183B, Plaintiffs must submit proof 
of the facts alleged.  

4 
Revised 5/2019 

(b) In cases where the land is to be submitted to Chapters 183A or 
183B, there is no longer a requirement that the master deed, or 
other timeshare document, be approved by the Court and registered 
prior to withdrawal.  Plaintiffs must have “. . . submitted the land 
or satisfy the court that the owners shall submit the land to chapter 
183A or 183B or shall create interests in the land to which said 
chapter 183B is applicable under section 3 of chapter 760 of the 
acts of 1987 or satisfy the court that the owners shall create those 
interests.” (G.L. c. 185, § 52 (iii)) 

i.  Plaintiffs’ or Plaintiffs’ attorney will provide the Land 
Court with an affidavit of intention to record a master 
deed and associated condominium documents.  
  

ii.  The Notice of Voluntary Withdrawal will only be 

approved conditional upon the recording of a master 
deed on the unregistered side.   

iii.  Registry District personnel will ascertain that the 
master deed has been recorded or will oversee its 
recording contemporaneously with the registration of 
the Notice of Voluntary Withdrawal. 
 

iv.  The recording sheet that is provided to the Registry 

Districts, by the Land Court, on which they report the 
document number of the Notice of Voluntary 
Withdrawal, will now contain a section in which the 
recording information of the master deed will also be 
reported. 

 

 

 

 

Section (iv) (occupied, commercial building) under the statute: 

(a) Plaintiffs may “. . . establish that the registered land is 

improved with an occupied building not used or occupied as or 
in connection with, and not designed or intended for use or 
occupancy as or in connection with, a 1-to-4 family residential 
dwelling.”  (G.L. c. 185, § 52 (iv))   

5 
Revised 5/2019 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Once established to the satisfaction of the Court, withdrawal 

 

will be allowed.  

(c) Supporting documentation may include, but is not limited to, 
Assessor’s records, surveys, photographs, and/or affidavits.  

Section (v) (good cause) under the statute:  

(a) When voluntary withdrawal is sought for “other good cause,” 

the Complaint must set forth, with specificity, the grounds upon 
which the Court is asked to find “good cause.” 

(b) Under this section, the Court will determine, based upon the 

facts and circumstances, the existence of hardship prior to the 
appointment of an outside title examiner.  

6.  Title examination by a Land Court examiner is required.  The Court will 
appoint an examiner pursuant to SJC Rule 1:07.  (Any request for a non- 
sequential appointment in accordance with the Rule must be made at the 
time of filing the Complaint.)  When the Court appoints an examiner, it will 
send the Title Examiner Appointment Letter to Plaintiffs’ attorney, who is 
responsible for sending the Title Examiner Appointment Letter to the 
examiner, together with a copy of the Complaint.  

7.  The title examination should run from the date of the outstanding 

Certificate of Title and list all of the owners, mortgagees, and lessees, with 
an address for each. 

8.  Notice to all mortgagees and lessees of record is required.  If Plaintiffs do 
not submit the assents of all mortgagees and lessees, a citation will be 
issued.  Upon receipt of assents from all those entitled to notice, or their 
default, the case will be treated as an uncontested matter, and presented to 
the Court for its consideration.  The Court will determine if further 
submissions or a hearing are required.  If any party notified files an 
opposition to the Complaint, the case will be treated as a contested case, to 
be resolved according to the penultimate sentence of Section 52.  

6 
Revised 5/2019 

9.  Upon the filing with the Court’s Land Registration District of the Notice of 
Voluntary Withdrawal endorsed by a Justice of the Land Court, it will be 
noted on the Certificate of Title, which then will be canceled, the land 
described in the Notice of Voluntary Withdrawal shall be deemed 
withdrawn and shall become unregistered land, and the owners shall hold 
title thereto at the time of such filing “free of all liens and encumbrances 
existing as of the time of filing of the notice, including adverse possession 
and prescriptive rights, as though a judgment of confirmation without 
registration effective as of the time of filing of the notice had been recorded 
under section 56A; provided, however, that the owners shall not hold title 
free of the encumbrances set forth or referred to in section 46 and those 
noted on the certificate of title or filed for registration before the filing of 
the notice of voluntary withdrawal.” (G.L. c. 185, § 52) 

10. The Chief Title Examiner and Survey Department will receive, from the 

local Registry District, verification of the filing of the Notice of Voluntary 
Withdrawal, with the document number and date of filing, and the 
verification will be docketed in the Subsequent Petition case. 

11. Plaintiffs’ attorney should be aware that they may want to record the Notice 
of Voluntary Withdrawal of Land from the Registration System on the 
unregistered side of the Registry to provide a starting point for the title on 
the unregistered side.  A “Register This Copy,” a “Record This Copy,” and 
a “Copy” (the Copy is for the Attorney’s records) of the endorsed Notice of 
Voluntary Withdrawal are provided by the Land Court. 

Please note that any authority documents for the registered 
owner(s) will be necessary at the time of the registration of the 
endorsed Notice of Voluntary Withdrawal.
