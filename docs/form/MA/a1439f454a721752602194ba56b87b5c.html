You will need your Badge Number and PIN, located. above your name on the Summons, and your ZIPCode. You will be guided through the process. . WHOMUSTSERVE. GENERALINFORMATION. Hours: Although jurors sitting on a case usually. report at 9: 00 a. m. and leave by 4: 30 p. m. , on the. . first morning of your jury service you must report. . earlier for an orientation program. The exact time is. . printed on your Summons and Reminder Notice, . and can be found on our website at. . www. MAjury. gov. under ﬁCourthouse Information. ﬂYou will be dismissed from the courthouse as soon. . as possible after the court knows with certainty that. . jurors are no longer needed. . What to bring: You should bring your completed. Confidential Juror Questionnaire (found on the back. . of your Reminder Notice and on our website) and. your Summons or Reminder Notice. Because you. may have to wait before being sent to a courtroom, . . you may want to bring reading materials, work, or. . something else to occupy your time. You should. . also bring a bottle of water and money for snacks. and lunch, or you can carry these food items with. you. What not to bring: You will have to pass through a. security checkpoint to enter the courthouse, and. certain items are prohibited at some courthouses. . . Call the courthouse to find out if cell phones, . . laptops, cameras, knitting needles, or similar items. are permitted in the jury pool at that court. Weapons. . are not allowed. You cannot bring children or pets. . with you to jury service (although certified service. . animals are allowed) . . What to wear: Jurors consider serious matters of. great importance to the parties, and their clothing. . and attitude should reflect an appreciation of the. . serious nature of the cases. While business attire is. . not required on the first day, you should dress. . respectfully in clean, neat attire suitable for court. . Confidential Juror Questionnaire: . On the back ofyour Reminder Notice you will find the Confidential. Juror Questionnaire (CJQ) , which you must. . complete and bring to the courthouse. The CJQ. helps the court and the parties decide who is best. suited to sit on a particular jury, and takes the place. . of more detailed individual questioning of jurors. . . Willful misrepresentation on the CJQ is a crime, so. . you must be sure to complete the CJQ fully and. . truthfully. CJQs are collected by the court after. . impanelment and only the court personnel have. access to them. If you are not seated on a jury, your. . CJQ is destroyed. . Hardships: . Remember that you have the right toreschedule your jury service to a date that is. . convenient for you, up to a year from the date you. . were originally summoned. You can pick your own. . date online at www. MAjury. gov. or call our Call Center for assistance. You should try to resolve any. . hardships by picking a date that will minimize any. . inconvenience and allow you to meet your civic. . obligation. You will also have an opportunity to speak to a. judge before being impaneled on a case. If you. . have a hardship that prevents you from serving, you. . can explain it to the judge and ask to be excused. Only a judge can excuse you from jury duty: . Ifyou have a problem that must be resolved before. . you are to go to the courtroom (such as an urgent. . medical issue) , tell the jury pool officer when you. . arrive. If you are in the rare situation where coming. . to the courthouse is itself a severe hardship, explain. . your circumstances in writing and mail your request. . to us at Office of Jury Commissioner, 560 Harrison. . Avenue, Suite 600, Boston, MA 02118. . Impanelment: If you are sent to a courtroom for. impanelment, the judge will explain the case, . identify the parties and witnesses, and inform you. how long the trial is expected to last. Everyone will. . be asked a few general questions, such as whether. you know anyone involved in the case and whether. . you can be impartial. You may be asked questions. . of a personal and sensitive nature, such as whether. . you or a family member have been a victim or. accused of a crime, in an effort to determine your. . ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror in a. . particular case. You will be able to speak to the. . judge if necessary, and the judge and the attorneys. . will discuss whether you can be impaneled on the. jury or if you should be excused. Cancellations: Sometimes, the needs of the courtwill change after the jurors have already been. . summoned to appear. You may receive a. . cancellation notice in the mail a few days or even. weeks before your service, or your service may be. . cancelled when you call the Juror Line the day. . before you are scheduled to appear. If your service. . is cancelled, you should report to work if you are. . employed. Only those who are actually required to. . appear at the courthouse receive credit for serving, . . and are then disqualified for three years. We regret. . the inconvenience to jurors who make plans to. . serve and are then cancelled, but cancelling is. . preferable to bringing people to court when they are. . no longer needed to help resolve cases on that day. . Employment issues: Your Massachusetts. employer is required to pay your salary for the first. . three days of service, and cannot unreasonably. . interfere with your jury service. You cannot be fired. . or penalized for going to jury duty, and you cannot. . be required to work a night shift during jury. . service. If you have questions or problems related. . to your work, call the Office of Jury Commissioner. . at 1 800 THE JURY (843 5879) . and ask for the Legal Department. When to report, length of service: . Check your Summons or Reminder Notice to find out what time. you must report for service (usually 8: 00 or 8: 30. . a. m. ) . Most jurors, but not all, serve for one day. . . Most trials, but not all, are completed in three days. . or less, so the court will expect you to be available. . to return for at least three days if necessary. Before. . seating you on a jury, the judge will tell you the. . estimated length of the trial. Reminder Notice Šdirections, parking, etc. : . About 10 days before your date of service, you will. . receive a Reminder Notice with a map, directions, . . and information about parking, public. . transportation and accessibility. The Notice will also. . include your Group Number and the telephone. . number of your court™s Juror Line. You must call the. . Juror Line after 3 p. m. on the day before your. . service to receive final instructions, including. . whether or not you still need to report. . Accessibility: The Trial Court and the Office of Jury. Commissioner are committed to making juror. . service as accessible as possible to the broadest. . range of eligible jurors. For more information, . . please visit our website at www. MAjury. gov. andclick on ﬁAccessibility. ﬂ. You can also contact us at. Juror Help@jud. state. ma. us . or at 1 800 THE JURY (1 800 843 5879) . Exemptions: There are no exemptions from jury. service. Massachusetts law requires every qualified. . citizen between the ages of 18 and 70 to serve. . (Those over age 70 may request a disqualification, . . if desired. ) Even residents of other states (such as. . college students) must serve if they live in. Massachusetts for six months of the year or more. . Qualifications: All citizens age 18 and over who. are legal residents of Massachusetts, or who live in. . the state for six months of the year or more, are. . eligible for jury duty. You may be disqualified if you. . meet one of the 10 statutory disqualifications found. . in the ﬁJuror Instructions and Informationﬂ brochure. . you received with your Summons. . Civic responsibility: . Jury duty is a civic privilegeand obligation that every citizen must perform. . Doctors, clergy, homemakers, police officers Š. . even judges and lawyers Š must serve when. called. The judge may excuse some people based. on their individual circumstances, but in general. . jurors represent a cross section of the community. . Jurors must be fair and impartial, and must treat. everyone equally regardless of race, color, creed, or. . other differences. The function of the jury is to work. . together to reach a decision based on the evidence. . presented at trial and the jurors' own common. . sense and experience. No one juror's opinion, . . background, or experience makes him or her more. . qualified to serve than another. Remember, the. . jury's verdict is a group decision, not the decision of. . any one person. BBe. ef. fo. or. re. e . G. Go. oi. in. ng. g . t. to. o . C. Co. ou. ur. rt. t A. At. t . t. th. he. e .
