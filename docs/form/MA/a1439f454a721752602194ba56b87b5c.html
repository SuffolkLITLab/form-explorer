The judge will explain your responsibilities if you are
selected to sit on a jury.  As a juror, you will hear the
evidence and decide the facts.  The members of the
jury  evaluate  the  evidence  and  work  together  to
reach a decision and render a verdict.

is  presented 

The judge will guide the conduct of the trial, making
sure  that  the  evidence 
in  an
appropriate manner and that the parties follow the
rules.  At  the  end  of  the  trial  and  before  the  jury
deliberations,  the  judge  instructs  you  on  the
principles  of  law  applicable  to  the  case.  In
deliberations, you and your fellow jurors discuss the
evidence  in  private  and  apply  the  law  to  reach  a
decision, known as a verdict. The verdict is the final
decision of the jury, which resolves the case.

As a sitting juror, you must remain fair and impartial
at  all  times.    Do  not  communicate  with  anyone
about the case while it is going on, even with your
fellow jurors or your family.  Do not use online social
media to share or read information about the case
or your experience with jury service.  Do not look for
information about the case outside the courtroom,
or use the internet to do research about the case or
the  people  involved  in  it.    If  anyone  starts  to  talk
about the case, you should interrupt them and tell
them  that  you  are  a  juror  and  cannot  hear  any
discussion about the case outside the courtroom.  If
necessary, tell the court officer what happened.

Compensation:  Your  Massachusetts  employer  is
required  by  law  to  pay  your  regular  wages  for  the
first three days of jury service. After three days, the
state will pay you $50 per day, but some employers
will  compensate  an  employee  even  after  the  third
day. Know your company’s policy before reporting
for 
jurors  must
compensate  themselves  for  the  first  three  days  of
service  unless  they  can  demonstrate  extreme
financial hardship to the judge. Travel expenses for
employed jurors are not reimbursed.

jury  service.  Self-employed 

Generally, 

Reimbursement:
jurors  are  not
reimbursed for expenses. If you are a student or not
employed,  you  may  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable
out-of-pocket  expenses  (excluding  food)  incurred
during  the  first  three  days  of  jury  service,  up  to  a

maximum  of  $50  per  day.  After  the  third  day,  the
state will pay all jurors $50 per day.

You  must  request  a  reimbursement  form  from  the
court officer as soon as possible. You may have to
explain your expenses to the judge.

Proof of service: The Office of Jury Commissioner
provides  juror  service  certificates  to  those  who
have  performed  juror  service,  generally  within  one
to  two  weeks.  The  certificate  includes  a  copy  for
your employer. You should give your employer this
copy of the certificate as soon as you receive it.

Discussing  the  case  after  trial: You  are  not
required to speak with anyone once the trial is over.
However,  the  judge  may  invite  interested  jurors  to
meet with the lawyers and the judge together after
the verdict.
After  the  jury  is  dismissed,  you  are  no  longer
prohibited from talking about the trial. However, you
should  avoid  revealing  the  names  of  other  jurors,
how any juror voted, or anything discussed during
jury  deliberations.  If  anyone  tries  to  learn  this
confidential  information  from  you,  or  if  you  feel
harassed  or  embarrassed  in  any  way,  you  should
report  it  to  the  court  or  the  Office  of  Jury
Commissioner immediately. It is very important that
the integrity of our jury system is maintained.

Weather  emergencies: Court  is  rarely  cancelled
due  to  weather  or  other  public  emergency,  but
jurors’  safety  always  takes  priority.  Depending  on
the  circumstances,  court  cancellations  will  be
announced  on  the  Juror  Line  listed  on  your
Reminder  Notice, 
at
on 
www.MAjury.gov,  on  the  Trial  Court  website  at
www.mass.gov/courts,  and/or  on  local  radio  and
television stations.

If you cannot appear for your first day of service:
If  you  cannot  report  for  service  as  scheduled  you
can  postpone  your  service  on  our  website  at
www.MAjury.gov. You will need the Badge Number
and  PIN  from  your  Summons  or  Reminder  Notice,
and your ZIP Code. You can also call us at 1-800-
THE-JURY (843-5879) for assistance.

If you have been impaneled on a jury and cannot
return to court for a subsequent day: You must
make every effort to honor your commitment once
you  have  been  selected  as  a  juror  on  a  case.  The
parties,  witnesses,  your  fellow  jurors,  and  the
courthouse  personnel  are  all  depending  on  you,
and  the  court  may  impose  consequences  on  an
impaneled juror who does not complete his or her
service.  If  an  emergency  prevents  you  from
returning  to  court,  you  must  call  the  courthouse
directly  as  soon  as  possible.  The  court  officer  will
give  you  the  telephone  number  after  you  are
impaneled.

If you need to attend to an emergency while you
are  at  the  courthouse: A  judge  can  excuse  you
from jury service at any time. You can be contacted
at the courthouse during your service in the event of
emergency.  Inform  the  court  officer  if  you  need
assistance. If necessary, the court officer will notify
the judge.

Under  our  state  and  federal  Constitutions,  all
people are entitled to a jury trial if the government
accuses  them  of  a  crime  and  seeks  to  take  away
their freedom. You may also be entitled to a jury trial
to  settle  a  civil  dispute  concerning  money  or
property.  Your  jury  service  is  a  core  component  in
guaranteeing 
for
everyone. 

these  constitutional 

rights 

Citizens from all segments of our society participate
in  the  administration  of  justice  through  the  jury
system,  which  is  one  of  the  key  elements  of  our
participatory  democracy.  Other 
than  military
service,  jury  duty  is  the  one  time  that  your
government will call on you to serve to protect our
constitutional  freedoms.  When  called  for  service,
please serve with pride.

You have been summoned for service
as a trial juror in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. This Handbook is
intended to answer some of the most
common questions you may have.
Additional information is available
on our website at www.MAjury.gov.

Please read this Handbook
carefully so that you will be better
prepared to serve as a trial juror. If
you are selected to serve, the judge
will give you additional instructions.
In the event of a conflict, you should
always follow the judge’s instructions,
rather than the more general
directions in this Handbook.

(December 2015)

The court system is committed to treating all jurors fairly and
respectfully,  regardless  of  race,  color,  religious  creed,
national  origin,  sex,  age,  ancestry,  ability,  or  sexual
orientation.  If  you  feel  that  you  have  experienced  or
witnessed  discriminatory  treatment  during  your  term  of
service, please contact us at 1-800-THE-JURY (843-5879)

GENERAL INFORMATION

WHO MUST SERVE

Civic  responsibility: Jury  duty  is  a  civic  privilege
and  obligation  that  every  citizen  must  perform.
Doctors,  clergy,  homemakers,  police  officers  —
even  judges  and  lawyers  —  must  serve  when
called. The judge may excuse some people based
on  their  individual  circumstances,  but  in  general
jurors represent a cross-section of the community.

Jurors  must  be  fair  and  impartial,  and  must  treat
everyone equally regardless of race, color, creed, or
other differences.  The function of the jury is to work
together to reach a decision based on the evidence
presented  at  trial  and  the  jurors'  own  common
sense  and  experience.    No  one  juror's  opinion,
background, or experience makes him or her more
qualified  to  serve  than  another.    Remember,  the
jury's verdict is a group decision, not the decision of
any one person.

Qualifications: All  citizens  age  18  and  over  who
are legal residents of Massachusetts, or who live in
the  state  for  six  months  of  the  year  or  more,  are
eligible for jury duty. You may be disqualified if you
meet one of the 10 statutory disqualifications found
in the “Juror Instructions and Information” brochure
you received with your Summons.

Exemptions: There  are  no  exemptions  from  jury
service. Massachusetts law requires every qualified
citizen  between  the  ages  of  18  and  70  to  serve.
(Those over age 70 may request a disqualification,
if desired.) Even residents of other states (such as
college  students)  must  serve  if  they  live  in
Massachusetts for six months of the year or more.

Accessibility: The Trial Court and the Office of Jury
Commissioner  are  committed  to  making  juror
service  as  accessible  as  possible  to  the  broadest
range  of  eligible  jurors.    For  more  information,
please  visit  our  website  at  www.MAjury.gov and
click on “Accessibility.”

You can also contact us at
JurorHelp@jud.state.ma.us 
or at 1-800-THE-JURY (1-800-843-5879)

information 

Reminder  Notice  — directions,  parking,  etc.:
About 10 days before your date of service, you will
receive  a  Reminder  Notice  with  a  map,  directions,
and 
public
about 
transportation and accessibility. The Notice will also
include  your  Group  Number  and  the  telephone
number of your court’s Juror Line. You must call the
Juror  Line  after  3  p.m.  on  the  day  before  your
service  to  receive  final  instructions,  including
whether or not you still need to report.

parking, 

Confidential Juror Questionnaire: On the back of
your Reminder Notice you will find the Confidential
Juror  Questionnaire 
(CJQ),  which  you  must
complete  and  bring  to  the  courthouse.  The  CJQ
helps the court and the parties decide who is best
suited to sit on a particular jury, and takes the place
of  more  detailed  individual  questioning  of  jurors.
Willful misrepresentation on the CJQ is a crime, so
you  must  be  sure  to  complete  the  CJQ  fully  and
truthfully.  CJQs  are  collected  by  the  court  after
impanelment  and  only  the  court  personnel  have
access to them. If you are not seated on a jury, your
CJQ is destroyed.

When  to  report,  length  of  service: Check  your
Summons or Reminder Notice to find out what time
you  must  report  for  service  (usually  8:00  or  8:30
a.m.).  Most  jurors,  but  not  all,  serve  for  one  day.
Most trials, but not all, are completed in three days
or less, so the court will expect you to be available
to return for at least three days if necessary. Before
seating  you  on  a  jury,  the  judge  will  tell  you  the
estimated length of the trial.

Cancellations: Sometimes, the needs of the court
will  change  after  the  jurors  have  already  been
summoned 
receive  a
to  appear.  You  may 
cancellation  notice  in  the  mail  a  few  days  or  even
weeks before your service, or your service may be
cancelled  when  you  call  the  Juror  Line  the  day
before you are scheduled to appear. If your service
is  cancelled,  you  should  report  to  work  if  you  are
employed. Only those who are actually required to
appear at the courthouse receive credit for serving,
and are then disqualified for three years. We regret
the  inconvenience  to  jurors  who  make  plans  to
serve  and  are  then  cancelled,  but  cancelling  is
preferable to bringing people to court when they are
no longer needed to help resolve cases on that day.

issues:

Employment 
Your  Massachusetts
employer is required to pay your salary for the first
three  days  of  service,  and  cannot  unreasonably
interfere with your jury service. You cannot be fired
or penalized for going to jury duty, and you cannot
be  required  to  work  a  night  shift  during  jury
service. If you have questions or problems related
to your work, call the Office of Jury Commissioner
at  1-800-THE-JURY  (843-5879) and  ask  for  the
Legal Department.

Hours: Although  jurors  sitting  on  a  case  usually
report at 9:00 a.m. and leave by 4:30 p.m., on the
first  morning  of  your  jury  service  you  must  report
earlier for an orientation program. The exact time is
printed  on  your  Summons  and  Reminder  Notice,
and  can  be 
found  on  our  website  at
www.MAjury.gov under “Courthouse Information.”
You will be dismissed from the courthouse as soon
as possible after the court knows with certainty that
jurors are no longer needed.

What  to  bring: You  should  bring  your  completed
Confidential Juror Questionnaire (found on the back
of  your  Reminder  Notice  and  on  our  website)  and
your  Summons  or  Reminder  Notice.  Because  you
may have to wait before being sent to a courtroom,
you  may  want  to  bring  reading  materials,  work,  or
something  else  to  occupy  your  time.  You  should
also bring a bottle of water and money for snacks
and  lunch,  or  you  can  carry  these  food  items  with
you.

What not to bring: You will have to pass through a
security  checkpoint  to  enter  the  courthouse,  and
certain  items  are  prohibited  at  some  courthouses.
Call  the  courthouse  to  find  out  if  cell  phones,
laptops, cameras, knitting needles, or similar items
are permitted in the jury pool at that court. Weapons
are not allowed. You cannot bring children or pets
with  you  to  jury  service  (although  certified  service
animals are allowed).

What to wear: Jurors consider serious matters of
great  importance  to  the  parties,  and  their  clothing
and  attitude  should  reflect  an  appreciation  of  the
serious nature of the cases. While business attire is
not  required  on  the  first  day,  you  should  dress
respectfully in clean, neat attire suitable for court.

Hardships: Remember  that  you  have  the  right  to
reschedule  your  jury  service  to  a  date  that  is
convenient for you, up to a year from the date you
were originally summoned. You can pick your own
date  online  at  www.MAjury.gov or  call  our  Call
Center for assistance. You should try to resolve any
hardships  by  picking  a  date  that  will  minimize  any
inconvenience  and  allow  you  to  meet  your  civic
obligation.

You  will  also  have  an  opportunity  to  speak  to  a
judge  before  being  impaneled  on  a  case.  If  you
have a hardship that prevents you from serving, you
can explain it to the judge and ask to be excused.

Impanelment:
If  you  are  sent  to  a  courtroom  for
impanelment,  the  judge  will  explain  the  case,
identify  the  parties  and  witnesses,  and  inform  you
how long the trial is expected to last. Everyone will
be asked a few general questions, such as whether
you know anyone involved in the case and whether
you can be impartial. You may be asked questions
of a personal and sensitive nature, such as whether
you  or  a  family  member  have  been  a  victim  or
accused  of  a  crime,  in  an  effort  to  determine  your
ability  to  serve  as  a  fair  and  impartial  juror  in  a
particular  case.  You  will  be  able  to  speak  to  the
judge if necessary, and the judge and the attorneys
will discuss whether you can be impaneled on the
jury or if you should be excused.

Only  a  judge  can  excuse  you  from  jury  duty:
If
you  have  a  problem  that  must  be  resolved  before
you are to go to the courtroom (such as an urgent
medical  issue),  tell  the  jury  pool  officer  when  you
arrive. If you are in the rare situation where coming
to the courthouse is itself a severe hardship, explain
your circumstances in writing and mail your request
to us at Office of Jury Commissioner, 560 Harrison
Avenue, Suite 600, Boston, MA 02118.
