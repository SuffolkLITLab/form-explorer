      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Discussing the cases before and after your grand
jury  service: As  a  sitting  grand  juror,  you  must
remain fair and impartial at all times.  You should not
talk to anyone about the cases brought before you,
even  your  family.    The  proceedings  of  the  grand
jury  are  confidential  and  must  remain  that  way,
even  after  your  service  is  completed.
If  anyone
starts to talk about any of the cases you have con-
sidered, you should interrupt and tell them that you
are  a  grand  juror  and  cannot  hear  any  discussion
about the case outside the grand jury room.  If nec-
essary, tell the prosecutor what happened.

Compensation  for  the  first  three  days  of  your
grand juror service: Your Massachusetts employer
is required by law to pay your regular wages for the
first three days of jury service. Know your company’s
policy  before  reporting  for  jury  service.  Self-
employed  jurors  must  compensate  themselves  for
the  first  three  days  of  service  unless  they  can
demonstrate extreme financial hardship to the judge.
Travel  expenses  for  employed  jurors  are  not  reim-
bursed.

Reimbursement: Generally,  jurors  are  not  reim-
bursed  for  expenses.  If  you  are  a  student  or  not
employed,  you  may  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable
out-of-pocket  expenses  (excluding  food)  incurred
during  the  first  three  days  of  jury  service,  up  to  a
maximum of $50 per day. You must request a reim-
bursement  form  from  the  court  officer  as  soon  as
possible. You may have to explain your expenses to
the judge.

Compensation from the fourth day onward: If you
are on the grand jury for more than three days, the
state  will  pay  you  $50  per  day  after  the  third  day.
Many employers will compensate an employee even
after the third day so that the employee will not suf-
fer financial loss because of juror service.  It is very
important  that  you  complete  the  Confidential
Financial  Questionnaire  form  and  bring  it  with  you
when you appear.  More details about compensation
from the fourth day onward will be given to you if you
are impaneled on a grand jury.

Proof of service: The Office of Jury Commissioner
provides grand juror service certificates to those who
have performed grand juror service, generally within
one to two weeks. The certificate includes a copy for
your  employer.  You  should  give  your  employer  this
copy of the certificate as soon as you receive it. The
certificates are issued on a weekly basis.

When  your  term  as  a  grand  juror  is  completed:
Unless ordered or authorized by the court, no person
has the authority to question you about your work as
a grand juror. Unless otherwise ordered or authorized
by the court, you must not reveal the names of the
other grand jurors, how any juror voted at any point,
or any of the discussions or other sensitive matters
that  occurred  during  your  secret  deliberations.  If
anyone should seek information to harass or embar-
rass  you  or  another  grand  juror  or  to  seek  to  learn
what  occurred  in  the  privacy  of  your  deliberations,
you should report this to the court immediately. It is
very important that the integrity of our jury system be
maintained.

Weather  emergencies: Court  is  rarely  cancelled
due to weather or other public emergency, but jurors’
safety  always  takes  priority.  Depending  on  the  cir-
cumstances,  court  cancellations  will  be  announced
on  the  Juror  Line  phone  number  listed  on  your
Reminder  Notice, 
at
on 
www.MAjury.gov,  on  the  Trial  Court  website  at
www.mass.gov/courts,  and/or  on  local  radio  and
television stations.

If you cannot appear for your first day of service:
If you cannot report for service as scheduled you can
postpone  your  service  on  our  website  at
www.MAjury.gov. You will need the Badge Number
and  PIN  from  your  Summons  or  Reminder  Notice,
and  your  ZIP  Code.  You  can  also  call  us  at  1-800-
THE-JURY (843-5879) for assistance.

If you need to attend to an emergency while you
are  at  the  courthouse: A  judge  can  excuse  you
from jury service at any time. In an emergency, you
may be contacted via the District Attorney's Office.
The  person  in  charge  of  the  grand  jury  will  provide
this number to you on your first day of service. You
should also use this number if you cannot attend on
a scheduled meeting day.

AFFIDAVIT -  a  written  declaration  or  statement  of
facts,  made  voluntarily,  and  confirmed  by  oath  or
affirmation.

DEFENDANT - the person defending or denying; the
accused in a criminal case.

GRAND JURY -  a  body  of  citizens  whose  duties
consist  of  determining  whether  probable  cause
exists that a crime has been committed and whether
an  indictment  should  be  returned  against  one  for
such a crime. Its function does not include determi-
nation of guilt.

INDICTMENT -  an  accusation  in  writing  presented
by  a  grand  jury,  charging  that  a  person  has  done
some act, or been guilty of some omission, which by
law is a public offense. An indictment is referred to as
a "true bill," and a refusal to indict is called a "no bill."
An indictment is only an accusation. Its sole purpose
is to identify the defendant's alleged offense, and it is
not evidence that the offense charged was commit-
ted  or  that  the  person  charged  committed  that
offense.

PRESENTMENT - the formal delivery of indictments
and no bills to a judge in open court session in the
presence of all members of the grand jury.

PROBABLE CAUSE - reasonable cause; an appar-
ent state of facts found to exist upon presentation of
evidence  to  members  of  the  grand  jury  that  would
lead  a  reasonably  intelligent  and  prudent  person  to
believe that the accused person has committed the
crime charged.

PROSECUTOR - one who commences an investiga-
tion by making an affidavit charging a named person
with an offense on which a warrant is issued, or an
indictment  or  information  is  based.  The  prosecutor
may  be  the  Attorney  General,  Assistant  Attorney
General, the District Attorney, or an Assistant District
Attorney.

You have been summoned for service
as a grand juror in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This Handbook is intended to answer
some of the most common questions
you may have. Additional information
is available on our website at
www.MAjury.gov

Please read this Handbook
carefully so that you will be better
prepared to serve as a grand juror.
If you are selected to serve, the judge
will give you additional instructions.
In the event of a conflict, you should
always follow the judge’s instructions,
rather than the more general
directions in this Handbook.

(February 2014)

The court system is committed to treating all jurors fairly and
respectfully,  regardless  of  race,  color,  religious  creed,
national  origin,  sex,  age,  ancestry,  ability,  or  sexual
orientation.  If  you  feel  that  you  have  experienced  or
witnessed  discriminatory  treatment  during  your  term  of
service, please contact us at 1-800-THE-JURY (843-5879)
or at JurorHelp@jud.state.ma.us.

Civic responsibility: Grand jury duty is a civic privi-
lege and obligation that every citizen must perform.
Doctors, clergy, homemakers, police officers - even
judges and lawyers - must serve when called.  The
judge may excuse some people based on their indi-
vidual  circumstances,  but  in  general,  grand  jurors
represent a cross section of the community.

Grand  jurors  must  be  fair  and  impartial,  and  must
treat  everyone  equally  regardless  of  race,  color,  or
creed.  A grand jury is a group of 23 persons work-
ing as a unit to hear evidence that is presented by the
prosecutor. Its function is to consider this evidence,
then decide if enough evidence exists to indict (bring
a  criminal  charge  against)  a  person  or  corporation.
The grand jury does not decide the guilt or innocence
of the accused. Rather, it decides if there is probable
cause to bring the accused to trial. Thus, the grand
jury's work is a pre-trial function of the court.  No one
grand  juror's  opinion,  background,  or  experience
makes him or her more qualified to serve than anoth-
er.    Remember,  the  grand  jury's  verdict  is  a  group
decision, not the decision of any single person.

Qualifications: All citizens who are 18 and over and
who  are  legal  residents  of  Massachusetts,  or  who
live in the state for six months of the year or more,
are eligible for grand jury duty. You may be disquali-
fied if you meet one of the 10 statutory disqualifica-
tions  found  in  the  “Grand  Juror  Instructions  and
Information”  brochure  you  received  with  your
Summons.

Exemptions: There are no exemptions from grand
jury service. Massachusetts law requires every qual-
ified citizen between the ages of 18 and 70 to serve.
(Those over age 70 may request a disqualification, if
desired.) Even residents of other states (such as col-
lege  students)  must  serve 
in
Massachusetts for six months of the year or more.

Accessibility: The Trial Court and the Office of Jury
Commissioner are committed to making juror service
as  accessible  as  possible  to  the  broadest  range  of
eligible jurors.  For more information, please visit our
website  at  www.MAjury.gov
and  click  on
“Accessibility.”

Reminder Notice - Directions, Parking, etc.: About
10 days before your date of service, you will receive a
Reminder Notice with a map, directions, and informa-
tion about parking, public transportation and accessi-
bility.    Call  the  Juror  Line  the  night  before  your
service to confirm that grand jurors are reporting.

Confidential  Juror  Questionnaire: On  the  back  of
your  Reminder  Notice  you  will  find  the  Confidential
Juror Questionnaire (CJQ), which you must complete
and  bring  to  the  courthouse.  The  CJQ  helps  the
court and the parties decide who is best suited to sit
on  the  grand  jury,  and  takes  the  place  of  more
detailed  individual  questioning  of  jurors.  Willful
misrepresentation  on  the  CJQ  is  a  crime,  so  you
must be sure to complete the CJQ fully and truthfully.
CJQs  are  collected  by  the  court  after  impanelment
and only the court personnel have access to them. If
you  are  not  seated  on  a  grand  jury,  your  CJQ  is
destroyed.

Confidential  Financial  Questionnaire:
In  the
"Grand Juror Instructions and Information" brochure
you  received  with  your  summons  you  will  find  the
Confidential  Financial  Questionnaire  (CFQ),  which
you must complete and bring to the courthouse.  The
CFQ  helps  the  court  decide  on  your  compensation
for grand jury service from the fourth day of service
on.  Please see the section in this Handbook entitled
Compensation, and the CFQ itself.

When  to  report,  length  of  service: Check  your
summons or Reminder Notice to find out what time
you must report for service (usually 9:00 a.m.).  The
grand  jury  sits  for  a  term  of  three  (3)  months.
However, the number of days you must report each
week varies greatly from county to county, depend-
ing  on  the  needs  of  the  court.  The  prosecutor  will
instruct you more precisely on your first day of serv-
ice.  Grand  jurors  may  report  for  service  for  a  few
hours  each  day,  or  else  for  one  to  three  days  each
week,  during  the  3  month  session.  On  other  days,
grand jurors are not required to attend. The term of
your service may be extended beyond the 3 month
period if it is necessary to finish hearing a particular
matter.
Cancellations: Sometimes, the needs of the court
will change after the jurors have already been sum-
moned  to  appear.    You  may  receive  a  cancellation
notice in the mail a few days or even weeks before
your service.  If your service is cancelled, you should
report to work if you are employed.  Only those who
are  actually  required  to  appear  at  the  courthouse
receive  credit  for  serving,  and  are  then  disqualified
for three years.  We regret the inconvenience to jurors
who make plans to serve and are then cancelled.

Employment issues: Your Massachusetts employ-
er  is  required  to  pay  your  salary  for  the  first  three
days  of  service,  and  cannot  unreasonably  interfere
with your jury service. You cannot be fired or penal-
ized  for  going  to  jury  duty,  and  you  cannot  be
required  to  work  a  night  shift  during  jury  service.  If
you have questions or problems related to your work,
call the Office of Jury Commissioner at 1-800-THE-
JURY (843-5879) and ask for the Legal Department.

Hours:
If  you  are  impaneled  on  a  grand  jury,  the
court will determine the scheduled hours your partic-
ular grand jury will meet.  The exact time is printed on
your  summons  and  reminder  notice,  and  can  be
found  on  our  website  at  www.MAjury.gov under
"Juror  Courthouse  Information."    You  will  be  dis-
missed  from  the  courthouse  as  soon  as  possible
after the court knows with certainty that jurors are no
longer needed.

in  the  "Grand  Juror 

What  to  bring: You  should  bring  your  completed
Confidential Juror Questionnaire (found on the back
of your Reminder Notice, and on our website), your
completed  Confidential  Financial  Questionnaire
(found 
Instructions  and
Information"  brochure  you  received  with  your  sum-
mons,  and  on  our  website),  and  your  Summons  or
Reminder  Notice.    Because  you  may  have  to  wait
before being sent to a courtroom, you may want to
bring  reading  materials,  work,  or  something  else  to
occupy your time. You should also bring a bottle of
water and money for snacks and lunch, or you can
carry these food items with you.

What not to bring: You will have to pass through a
security  checkpoint  to  enter  the  courthouse,  and
certain  items  are  prohibited  at  some  courthouses.
Call  the  courthouse  to  find  out  if  cell  phones,
laptops,  cameras,  knitting  needles,  or  similar  items
are permitted in the jury pool at that court. Weapons
are  not  allowed.  You  cannot  bring  children  or  pets
with  you  to  jury  service  (although  certified  service
animals are allowed).

What  to  wear: Jurors  consider  serious  matters  of
great  importance  to  the  parties,  and  their  clothing
and  attitude  should  reflect  an  appreciation  of  the
serious nature of the cases. While business attire is
not  required  on  the  first  day,  you  should  dress
respectfully in clean, neat attire suitable for court.

please visit our informational webite at:

Hardships: Remember  that  you  have  the  right  to
request a deferment of your service to a date that is
convenient  for  you  up  to  a  year  from  the  date  you
were originally summoned.  Prospective grand jurors
may  request  deferment  of  their  service  to  either
January, April, July, or October, as most grand juries
are convened only during those months.  You should
try  to  resolve  any  hardships  by  picking  a  date  that
will  minimize  any  inconvenience  and  allow  you  to
meet  your  civic  obligation.    You  will  also  have  an
opportunity to speak to a judge before being impan-
eled on a grand jury.  If you have a hardship that pre-
vents  you  from  serving,  you  can  explain  it  to  the
judge and ask to be excused.

Only a judge can excuse you from jury duty: If you
have a problem that must be resolved before you are
considered for impanelment (such as an urgent med-
ical issue), tell the court officials when you arrive.  If
you  are  in  the  rare  situation  where  coming  to  the
courthouse  is  itself  a  severe  hardship,  explain  your
circumstances in writing and mail your request to us
at  Office  of  Jury  Commissioner,  560  Harrison
Avenue, Boston, MA 02118.

How  the  grand  jury  operates: On  the  first  day  of
service, a large group of prospective grand jurors will
appear  at  a  designated  courthouse  as  scheduled.
From this group, a total of 23 persons will be chosen
to form the grand jury. Alternates may be selected in
case a grand juror must be replaced due to illness or
emergency.  The grand jury elects its own foreperson
and clerk to assist in the proceedings. The grand jury
will hear evidence presented by the prosecutor. The
judge  and  the  prosecutor  will  explain  the  proceed-
ings in greater detail. The judge and prosecutor will
also explain your responsibilities if you are selected
to sit on a grand jury.  The members of the grand jury
evaluate  the  evidence  and  work  together  to  deter-
mine if there is enough to indict someone for a crime.
The  prosecutor  will  guide  the  conduct  of  the  pro-
ceedings,  calling  witnesses  and  presenting  evi-
dence.

Do  not  communicate  with  anyone  about  the  grand
jury proceedings, even with your fellow jurors or your
family.    Do  not  use  online  social  media  to  share  or
read information about the proceedings of the grand
jury.    Do  not  look  for  information  about  any  of  the
cases  outside  the  courtroom,  or  use  the  internet  to
do research about the cases or the people involved
in them.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
