they are also an heir or devisee. The appointment of a guardian ad litem may be waived by the court upon a

by the court that a conflict of interest does not exist between the conservator and person(s) represented.

  The form and documents should be filed in the county Probate and Family Court where the decedent was 

domiciled at the time of death; OR if the decedent was not domiciled in Massachusetts, in any county where

**Important Information – Please Read** 
Review all completed forms for accuracy prior to filing with the court.  If you do not understand any form, do not sign 
it!  Please consult an attorney for legal advice.  Court staff cannot provide legal advice or assist you with legal 
decisions. 

 

STEP 4:  Provide Citation Notice to Interested Persons and Notice by Publication 

□  Citation for Formal Adjudication (MPC 560) 

  After the filing of the petition, the court shall fix a return date and issue a citation.   Review the Order of Notice 
carefully.  Note:  The return date listed in a citation is NOT a hearing date.  It is the deadline date by which an 
interested party must file his or her written appearance if he or she wishes to contest a formal petition.    
  At least fourteen (14) days prior to the return day, the petitioner must provide a copy of MPC 560 either by in-
hand delivery or by registered, certified or ordinary first-class mail to the following interested persons (unless 
they have assented and waived their right to notice by completing form MPC 455): 

1)  surviving spouse; 
2)  children*; 
3)  other heirs of the decedent; 
4)  devisees and executors named in any will that is being, or has been probated, or offered for informal or formal 
probate in the county, or that is known by the petitioner to have been probated, or offered for informal or 
formal probate elsewhere; 
5)  any devisee that is a charity; 
6)  any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated; 
7)  any other person; 
8)  a conservator or guardian appointed to represent an heir or devisee who is a minor, incapacitated or protected 

person and the person represented regardless of age; 

9)  the Attorney General of Massachusetts, if there is no spouse or heir of the decedent or any devisee is a charity; 
10) any other person as the petitioner elects. 

MPC 964 (3/1/16)

  The petitioner must also give notice by publication by publishing a copy of the citation once in a newspaper 

designated by the register of probate having general circulation in the county where the proceeding is pending, 
at least 7 days prior to the return date.   

  The petitioner must file with the court the Return of Service stating the names of persons served, how served 
and the date of service.  The petitioner must also include details regarding the publication.  If a person entitled 
to notice has assented and waived their right to notice, the petitioner must include the written assent and 
waiver of notice (MPC 455).  

WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT  

 

 

 

If the petition is uncontested, the court may enter appropriate orders after the return date on the strength of 
the pleadings if satisfied that all conditions are met or the court may conduct a hearing and require proof of the 
matters necessary to support the order sought. 
If the petition is contested, the petitioner must file a Request for a Case Management Conference or other 
applicable form.  The division’s judicial case manager may be consulted for further information regarding the 
scheduling of a hearing date.    

  Once approved or denied, a copy of the Formal Decree and Order will be provided to the petitioner by mail or 

in-person.  
If a formal appointment has been approved, the registry shall be responsible for providing a copy of the Letters 
of Authority to the petitioner either in hand or by mail.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
