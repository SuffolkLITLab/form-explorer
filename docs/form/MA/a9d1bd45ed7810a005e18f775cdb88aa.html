Introduction

ince the 1983 decision of Rogers v. Commissioner of 
Department of Mental Health, 390 Mass 489 (1983), the 
Probate and Family Court has been charged with acting 
upon requests for permission to administer antipsychotic 
medication to individuals who are unable to consent to 
treatment themselves. A substituted judgment standard 
applies and, at a minimum, yearly reviews are required.  

This booklet provides information about Rogers 
guardianships, for adults, in Massachusetts. This is a type 
of guardianship where the Court determines the Guardian 
will be given authority to agree to extraordinary treatment 
for the Incapacitated Person (I.P.). This usually refers to 
treatment with antipsychotic medication but it may include 
other intrusive treatments and procedures. 

his booklet is intended to be a guide, and includes 

information regarding guardianship procedures, what forms 
to file, and duties of guardians.  

his booklet is not intended as a substitute for legal advice. 

You may want to consult with an attorney. For 
information about finding an attorney, please see this

What is 
What is 
A guardian for an adult is a person appointed by a judge in  
the Probate and Family Court who is given responsibility to 
make decisions for an individual after a judge has decided 
s/he is not competent to make their own informed decisions.    
Some guardians can make decisions about treatment of a 
person with mental illness that is considered “extraordinary” 
medical treatment.  These are called Rogers guardianships.   

t a Rogers guardianship hearing, the Court is asked to 

authorize extraordinary medical treatment for an 
Incapacitated Person. This usually refers to treatment with 
antipsychotic medication, but it may include other intrusive 
treatments and procedures such as sterilization or 
electroconvulsive therapy. 

f a person who has been determined to be incapacitated is 
prescribed antipsychotic medications, the Incapacitated 
Person will need a guardian who has been granted Rogers 
authority by the Court. 

efore Rogers authority is granted, the Court must find that 

the person: 
 

1.  Is incapacitated and not competent to give informed 

consent with respect to being treated with 
antipsychotic medications and, 

2.  If incompetent, determine what the person would 
choose to do if he or she were competent, with 
regard to taking antipsychotic medication(s). 

his is called a “substituted judgment” standard wherein the 

Court substitutes itself for the Incapacitated Person and 
attempts to determine what the person would decide for him

When the Court grants the guardian Rogers authority, the 
Court also appoints a person who is called a Rogers Monitor 
to oversee that the I.P. is being medicated in accordance 
with the Court approved treatment plan.  

The Rogers Monitor may be the person who was appointed 
as guardian or, it may be a different person. 

The Rogers Monitor should immediately review the details 
of the Appointment of Rogers Monitor (CJP 115) form 
which describes the duties of the Monitor. 

The Rogers Monitor and the guardian will review medical 
records, meet with staff and may attend case conferences if 
the I.P. is in a hospital or other facility. 

The Rogers Monitor must report to the Court in writing on a 
regular basis. A report must be filed prior to the yearly 
review. Failure to file reports may result in removal of the 
Monitor.
