Instructions for filing an Answer to a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage 

Do not file these instructions 

You must file your court documents electronically, unless you get permission from the court to submit 
your documents in paper to the clerk of court for filing.  Contact the clerk of court in your county if you 
are unable to file electronically. The electronic filing system is also known as EDMS. 

Electronic filing  

•  To file court documents, you must register with the court’s electronic filing system (EDMS).  See Iowa 
Court Rule 16.302. For help with registration, see the eFiler’s User Guide on the Iowa Judicial Branch 
website. 

•  Log in to EDMS on the Iowa Judicial Branch website and file your Answer.  

The login page can be accessed from two different paths: you may directly log in to EDMS; or from the 
judicial branch website menu, you may select "eFiling > eFile (EDMS) Login.” 

•  For help, see Filing in an existing case. 

•  You will receive a notice of electronic filing when the clerk of court has approved the eFiling of your Answer 

and other documents.  You can then open the Answer and print a copy for your records. 

• 

If there was a problem with your filing, EDMS will send you a Retraction Notice. You can then log in to My 
Filings, correct the error, and resubmit your Answer.  For help, see Resubmitting a returned filing. 

•  The notice of electronic filing will indicate if your spouse is excused from electronic filing requirements, in 

which case, you must mail or serve in paper a copy of the document on your spouse if he or she does not have an 
attorney. 

Exceptions to electronic filing requirement 

If you do not have attorney representation, the court or clerk of court may authorize a filer to submit a 
paper court document for filing to the clerk of court on a one-time basis.  Iowa Court Rule 16.302(2). An 
unrepresented Defendant who is not yet a registered filer may make an initial filing, such as an Answer, 
by submitting a paper document to the clerk of court for filing. Only for good cause may the court excuse 
an unrepresented party from electronic filing for the entire case. Lack of regular access to the internet may 
be good cause to be excused from electronic filing. See Iowa Court Rule 16.302(2)(c). 

Submitting a paper document for filing 

•  Make two photocopies of the original document. 

•  Take your original Answer form and the photocopies to the clerk of court’s office in the county where the 

Petition was filed.  The county is listed at the top of the Petition (form 101). 

•  The clerk will time-stamp your forms and copies. 

•  The clerk will take the original and give the copies back to you.  

•  Keep one of the copies for your records. 

•  Serve one of the copies of your Answer on your spouse (Petitioner). 

•  To serve the Answer you can hand one of the copies to your spouse, or mail a copy to your spouse at the 

address shown on the Petition.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
