      <pre>Instructions for Application to Expunge Misdemeanor Court Records Under Iowa 
Code Section 901C.3  
 

Under Iowa Code section 901C.3, some misdemeanor convictions may be expunged 
from your record; however, not all convictions can be expunged under this section, and 
you must be sure that your conviction qualifies for an expungement. Also, it is important 
to understand that under this section, you only get one of these expungements in your 
lifetime, unlike some other forms of expungement. Because of this, it is often a strategic 
decision whether or not to request an expungement of this kind. If you have questions 
about this, or if you do not understand any part of the application in general, you should 
seek the help of an attorney.  
 

• 

In General 
o  Be sure to fill out the application completely and check all the boxes that 
apply to you. Failure to fully complete the application may result in your 
expungement request being denied.  

o  “Defendant” means you, the person filling out the application.  
o  “County attorney” means the prosecutor in your case. The county attorney’s 

office is typically located in the county where you were prosecuted.  

o  You must complete all sections in this paragraph that apply to you.  

o  You must indicate that you have never received an expungement under 

section 901C.3 before. If you have, you cannot request another because you 
are permitted only one of these expungements in your lifetime. 
  Note: this does not include other forms of expungement that you may 

have previously received such as a deferred judgment or expungement of 
a dismissed case.   

•  Paragraph 1 

•  Paragraph 2 

•  Paragraph 3 

o 

Iowa Code section 901C.3 allows you to expunge all charges that are related 
or that arose out of the same facts and circumstances. This is true even if 
they have different case numbers, as long as they are factually related. To 
take advantage of this, you must apply to expunge all of the related charges 
at the same time. Be sure to list all of the charges with the associated case 
numbers that you wish to have expunged in the space provided.  
  Since you only get one of these expungements in your life, it is important 
that you request that all of the related charges be expunged at the same 
time and on the same application, otherwise, the once-in-a-lifetime bar will 
prohibit you from getting the related charges expunged at a later date.  
  Note: the application must also be filed in all of the cases that you are 

seeking to have expunged.

o  To check for multiple charges, review the sentencing order or your criminal 

history that you get from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) (see 
Paragraph 9 below) and look for offense dates that are the same or that are 
close in time.  

o  You can also ask your defense attorney on the criminal case (if you had one), 
the county attorney’s office in the county where you were convicted, or an 
Iowa Legal Aid attorney or private attorney who may help you with the 
expungement.  

•  Paragraph 4 

o  Not all misdemeanor charges are eligible for expungement under section 
901C.3. Refer to the list of Code section numbers in paragraph 4 of the 
application for charges that are ineligible and compare it to the section 
number you were convicted under.  

o  Keep in mind that Code sections change over the years and that you will have 

to compare the Code section in effect when you were convicted to the 
language of the Code sections listed in paragraph 4. For example, something 
that may be a felony now may have been a misdemeanor when you were 
convicted, or vice versa. The older your charge, the more of a chance that the 
Code has been changed, perhaps even more than once.  

o  The crime that you were initially charged with is often not the same one that 

you were convicted of. For example, if you pleaded guilty to a lower charge as 
part of a plea deal, or if the charge was later amended, the charge of your 
conviction may be different from the initial charge. The charge that you are 
convicted of is all that matters for the application, not the initial charge.  
o  To determine what charge you were actually convicted of, and not just initially 
charged with, review the conviction or sentencing order. The order will list the 
section number of conviction. Compare that number to the list of ineligible 
section numbers in paragraph 4, also keeping in mind the Code in effect in 
the year when you were convicted. You may also ask the county attorney’s 
office or the clerk of court’s office in the county where you were convicted and 
they may be able to provide you with that information. This analysis can be 
complicated. You may want to consult with an Iowa Legal Aid attorney or 
private attorney to make sure you understand your options. 

•  Paragraph 5 

o  You must have paid in full any court debt related to the case or cases you are 
seeking to have expunged. This does not apply to any outstanding money 
you may owe on any other unrelated cases, for example an unpaid speeding 
ticket.  

o  Contact the county attorney or clerk of court’s office in the county where you 
were convicted to verify whether you still owe any money on the case or 
cases you are trying to have expunged.

•  Paragraph 6 

•  Paragraph 7 

o  At least eight years must have passed since the court entered a conviction on 
the charge you are seeking to have expunged (not eight years since you were 
arrested or initially charged).  

o  You may not request an expungement if you have any pending criminal cases 
that have not been resolved. Typically, a case is still pending if you have court 
dates scheduled or if you were just recently arrested.  

o  This does not include pending minor traffic offenses such as a parking ticket 

or seat belt ticket.  

•  Paragraph 8 

o  You may not receive an expungement under section 901C.3 if you have 

previously received more than one deferred judgment. Receiving just one 
deferred judgment does not preclude you from an expungement under 
section 901C.3. 

o 

If you received a deferred judgment for multiple charges at the same time, it 
counts as only one.  

•  Paragraph 9 

o  You must attach a copy of your Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation 
(DCI) criminal history to your expungement application. The criminal 
history document cannot be more than 30 days old.  

 

It is best to have your expungement application completed and ready to 
file before requesting a copy of your criminal history. This will help avoid 
the criminal history becoming more than 30 days old and expiring.  
o  To request a copy of your criminal history, you must complete two forms—the 
Criminal History Request Form and the Criminal History Billing Form—and 
send the forms along with the proper payment to the DCI. Both forms can be 
found at https://dps.iowa.gov/divisions/criminal-investigation/criminal-history/ 
record-check-forms.   
  The first form (Criminal History Request Form) is the actual criminal 
history request. You must fill out all applicable parts and sign it (see 
example below).   

August 2021

criminal history sent (usually 
put your address here)

  The second form (Criminal History Billing Form) is used to submit the 

 

required payment for the criminal history document.  

  Completed forms may be delivered in person, by mail, or by fax. 

•  Mail or hand-delivery (with payment):  

Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation 
Support Operations Bureau 1st Floor, 215 E. 7th St. 
Des Moines, IA 50319 

•  Fax: 515-725-6080 

•  Read Before Signing section 

o  Read each paragraph and check the box on the left indicating that you 
understand the statement. If you do not understand the statement, you 
should consult with an Iowa Legal Aid attorney or private attorney. 

•  Certification of Service by Mailing or Delivery 

o 

o 

If you file the application electronically, then you do not need to fill out this 
section, as the court’s electronic document management system will 
automatically notify the county attorney. 

If you do not file the application electronically, then you must serve a copy of 
the application and all attachments on the county attorney by hand-delivering 
or mailing it to the county attorney’s office in the county of your conviction.

•  Oath and Signature 

o  This section must be filed out completely before filing. If you do not sign the 

application, then it will not be accepted.  
o  You may either sign the application by printing it out, signing it by hand, 
and scanning it into a PDF file or by electronically signing it (instructions 
on how to electronically sign a court form can be found at 
https://www.iowacourts.gov/for-the-public/court-forms/). 

o  When you sign the application, you are certifying under penalty of perjury that 

the information you have provided on it is true and correct.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
