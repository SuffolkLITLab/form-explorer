Instructions for Rule 17.300—Form 316: General Answer to Application to Modify Child Support 

Do not file these instructions 

Instructions for Filing an Answer to an Application to Modify Child Support 

The Iowa Judicial Branch is converting the court system to electronic filing county by county.  The 
electronic filing system is also known as EDMS.  To determine if this case is in a county using electronic 
filing, check the map available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website under eFiling, or call the clerk of 
court office in your county.  If your county accepts electronic filing, you must file electronically unless 
you get permission from the court to file in paper.  Contact the clerk of court in your county if you are 
unable to file electronically. 

  Filing your Answer electronically 

• 

If the Application was filed in a county that uses electronic filing, you must register to electronically 
file.  For help with registration, see the eFiler’s User Guide How to Register Pro Se (Self Represented) 
for eFiling on the Iowa Judicial Branch website. 

•  Scan the signed Answer form and save it as a .pdf. (Save it in a place that will be accessible to you 

when you electronically file.) 

•  Log in to EDMS on the Iowa Judicial Branch website and file your Answer.  

The login page can be accessed from two different paths: you may directly log in to EDMS; or from 
the judicial branch website menu, you may select "eFiling > eFile (EDMS) Login.” 

•  For help, see How to eFile to an Existing Case. 

•  You will receive a Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) when the clerk of court has approved the eFiling of 
your Answer and other documents.  You can then open the Answer and print a copy for your records. 

• 

If there was a problem with your filing, EDMS will send you a Retraction Notice. You can then log in to My 
Filings, correct the error, and resubmit your Answer.  For help, see How to Resubmit a Returned Filing. 

•  The NEF will indicate if your Applicant is exempt from electronic filing requirements, in which case, you 
must mail or serve in paper a copy of the document on Applicant if he or she does not have an attorney. 

  Filing your Answer in paper 

•  Make two photocopies of the original. 
• 

If the Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) is involved in your child support modification case, you 
must also provide each form you file to the CSRU office that serves the county where your child 
support case is filed. 

•  Take your original Answer form and the photocopies to the clerk of court’s office in the county where 

the Application was filed.  The county is listed at the top of the Application (form 301). 

•  The clerk will time-stamp your forms and copies. 
•  The clerk will take the original and give the copies back to you.  
•  Keep one of the copies for your records. 
•  Serve one of the copies of your Answer on Applicant. 
•  You can hand one of the copies of the Answer form to Applicant, or mail a copy to Applicant spouse 

at the address shown on the Application. 

• 

If Applicant has an attorney, you should serve the Answer by mailing a copy to the attorney at the 
attorney’s address.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
