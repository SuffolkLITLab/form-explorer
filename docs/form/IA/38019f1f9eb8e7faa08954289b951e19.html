Note: if you change your mind about any of these requests, you must tell the 
judge at the hearing. The hearing will occur 5 to 15 days after you file this Petition,

24. Protected or confidential information 

 

This file is a public record available to anyone, pursuant to Iowa Code section 236.10.  If you 
would like all or part of this file not to be available to the general public in order to protect the 
safety or privacy of any person, then you must ask the court to “seal” all or part of the file.

25. Plaintiff’s understanding of this Petition—read before signing  

When you file this Petition with the court, several legal matters are set into motion. Check 
each statement below after reading it. 

A.    I understand there will be a court hearing scheduled for 5 to 15 days after I file 
this  Petition.    At  this  hearing,  the  judge  will  decide  whether  to  give  me a  Final 
Protective  Order.    I  understand  that  if  I  cannot  be  there  on  that  date,  I  must 
immediately  ask  the  court  in writing  to change the  hearing  date  and I should 
contact the clerk of court.  

B.     I understand that I must attend the hearing.  If I change my mind and do not want 
a Final Protective Order, I should file with the clerk of court a "Request to Modify, 
Cancel, or Extend an Iowa Code Chapter 236 Final Protective Order" before the 
scheduled hearing. This form is available at the clerk of court's office and on the 
Iowa Judicial Branch website. 

C.    I  understand  that  a  law  enforcement  officer  will  give  Defendant  a copy  of  this 
Petition, if Defendant can be found, and that Defendant will receive other relevant 
court papers even if the file is “sealed.” 

D.    I understand that if I do not attend the hearing, or if I file a request to cancel the 
protective order, the court can dismiss the Temporary Protective Order so that it 
will no longer have any effect. 

E.     I understand that the hearing is my opportunity to tell the judge how I was abused 
or threatened, where it happened, and when it happened.  I can bring people with 
me to the hearing who saw Defendant abusing me or saw my injuries.  I can bring 
any  evidence I  have that  shows  I  have  been  abused, such  as medical  reports, 
police  reports,  texts,  voice  messages,  social  media  messages,  pictures,  other 
documents, or anything else that might help convince the judge that I need a Final

Protective Order. I may bring paper copies of any information I want the judge to 
see from my cell phone or other electronic device, such as screen shots of social 
media posts, pictures, texts, and emails. 

F.     I understand that the court will give primary consideration to the safety of me and 
my children.  I should tell the court how we will be in danger if Defendant is given 
custody or unrestricted visitation.  

G.      I  understand  that  the  hearing  is  my  opportunity  to  tell  the  court  what  financial 
support I need.  I should be ready to provide financial information at the hearing, 
such as income and living expenses and other expenses. 

H.     I understand that the Final Protective Order could be in place for up to one year.  
I also understand that if the Final Protective Order is granted, it may be extended 
beyond one year by filing for an extension before it expires. 

I.        I  understand  that  if  I  believe  Defendant  has  violated  the  Temporary  or  Final 
Protective Order, I can call law enforcement for assistance.  I also can bring this 
to  the  court's  attention  by  filing  with  the  clerk  of  court  an  "Affidavit  to  Start 
Contempt Proceedings." This form is available at the clerk of court's office and on 
the Iowa Judicial Branch website. 

J.     I  understand  that  if  a  Temporary  or  Final  Protective  Order  is  issued,  law 
enforcement  officers  can  use  every  reasonable  means  to  enforce  the  order, 
including arresting Defendant for violating the order.  I understand that, if a court 
finds that Defendant has violated the protective order, Defendant could be put in 
jail and have to pay a fine.  I also understand that I could be arrested, jailed, and 
fined if I initiate or voluntarily maintain any contact with Defendant in violation of 
the order, or if I otherwise violate the protective order. 

K.    I understand that requesting a protective order is a serious legal action.  If I want 
to change any part of the protective order, I should go back and tell the judge.  I 
should file with the clerk of court a "Request to Modify, Cancel, or Extend an Iowa 
Code chapter 236 Final Protective Order."  This form is available at the clerk of 
court's office and on the Iowa Judicial Branch website.
