Do not file these instructions 

Instructions for Filing an Application to Modify Child Support 

The Iowa Judicial Branch is converting the court system to electronic filing county by county.  The 
electronic filing system is also known as EDMS.  To determine if this case is in a county using electronic 
filing, check the map available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website under eFiling, or call the clerk of 
court office in your county.  If your county accepts electronic filing, you must file electronically, even if 
your original case was in paper, unless you get permission from the court to file in paper.  Contact the 
clerk of court in your county if you are unable to file electronically. 

  Filing your Application electronically 

• 

If you are filing your Application in a county that uses electronic filing, you must register to 
electronically file.  For help with registration, see the eFiler’s User Guide How to Register Pro Se (Self 
Represented) for eFiling. 

•  After you have registered, log in to the electronic filing system to electronically file your Application. 

•  For help electronically filing your Application, see How to eFile a New Case. 

•  With your Application, you must also file an Original Notice (304) and a Protected Information Disclosure 

(311). 

•  You will receive a Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) when the clerk of court has approved the eFiling 

of your Application and other documents. 

• 

If there was a problem with your filing, EDMS will send you a Retraction Notice. You can then log in to My 
Filings, correct the error, and resubmit your filing.  For help, see How to Resubmit a Returned Filing. 

•  Log in to your eFile account and download and print your Application and Original Notice so that you 

can serve it on (deliver it to) the other party. 

•  For help finding and downloading your Application and Original Notice, please see My Filings 

Reference Guide. 

  Filing your Application in paper 

• 

If the county where you will be filing your Application does not yet accept electronic filing, you must 
proceed in paper.  If the county does accept electronic filing, you must proceed electronically, unless 
you have received permission from the court to file in paper. 

•  With your Application (301), you must also file an Application Cover Sheet (302), an Original Notice 

(304a), and a Confidential Information Form (303). 

•  Forms 301 and 304a: Make two photocopies if you can deliver copies of these forms to the other party 
in-person or by mail. Make three photocopies if you are going to ask the county sheriff or a civil 
process server to deliver these forms to the other party. 

Note about making photocopies:  You should make your photocopies before you go to the courthouse to file 
your papers.  It is expensive to make photocopies at the clerk of court office. It is cheaper to make the copies 
at a business that makes photocopies or at a public library. 

• 

If the Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) is involved in your child support modification case, you 
must also provide each form you file to the CSRU office that serves the county where your child 
support case is filed. 

•  Forms 302 and 303: You do not have to make photocopies of these forms.

Instructions for Rule 17.300—Form 301: Application to Modify Child Support, continued 

•  Take the original forms you filled in and the photocopies to the clerk of court office in your county.  

Tell the clerk at the counter you are filing an Application to Modify Child Support. 

•  Give the clerk at the counter these forms: 

301  Application to Modify Child Support  

302  Coversheet for an Application to Modify Child Support 

303  Confidential Information Form (Do not make copies of this form.) 

304a  Original Notice 

•  Pay the filing fee.  If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, prepare and file form 309. 

•  The clerk at the counter can tell you the amount of the filing fee.  The Iowa legislature sets these fees 

and periodically raises them, so check with the clerk’s office to confirm the current filing fee. 

•  The clerk of court will sign the Original Notice (304a).  You will have to serve this form on 

(deliver it to) the other party. 

•  The clerk at the counter will time-stamp each of the copies (original and photocopies). 

Do not file these instructions
