14. Protected or confidential information 

 

This file is a public record available to anyone, pursuant to Iowa Code section 236A.11(3).  If 
you would like all or part of this file not to be available to the general public in order to protect 
the safety or privacy of any person, then you must ask the court to “seal” all or part of the file.   

  Defendant from whom you are seeking protection will have access to the file, even if the court 
seals it.  Some court records cannot be sealed, such as court orders and support payment 
records.  The court upon request may remove address and location information from those 
records. 

 

Check all that apply if you want this file to be sealed. 

  I request that this case file be sealed so that most parts of it are not available to the general 

public.  I understand that court orders and support records cannot be sealed. 

  I  request  that  the  court  remove  my  address,  county  of  residence,  and  other  location 

information from court documents.

Note: It is the responsibility of the person filing a document or exhibit with the court to ensure 
that protected or confidential information is omitted from or abbreviated on the document or 
exhibit.  See Iowa Court Rule 16.602.  Protected information, such as children’s full names or 
social  security  numbers,  should  be  abbreviated  on  this  form  and  provided  in  full  on  the 
Protected Information Disclosure form. 

15. Plaintiff’s understanding of this Petition—read before signing  

When you file this Petition with the court, several legal matters are set into motion. Check 
each statement below after reading it. 

A.    I understand there will be a court hearing scheduled for 5 to 15 days after I file 
this  Petition.    At  this  hearing,  the  judge  will  decide  whether  to  give  me a  Final 
Protective  Order.    I  understand  that  if  I  cannot  be  there  on  that  date,  I  must 
immediately  ask  the  court  in writing  to change the  hearing  date  and I should 
contact the clerk of court.  

B.     I understand that I must attend the hearing.  If I change my mind and do not want 
a Final Protective Order, I should file with the clerk of court a "Request to Modify, 
Cancel, or Extend an Iowa Code Chapter 236A Final Protective Order" before the 
scheduled hearing. This form is available at the clerk of court's office and on the 
Iowa Judicial Branch website.

C.    I understand that the hearing is my opportunity to tell the judge how I was abused 
or threatened, where it happened, and when it happened.  I can bring people with 
me to the hearing who saw Defendant abusing me or saw my injuries.  I can bring 
any  evidence I  have that  shows  I  have  been  abused, such  as medical  reports, 
police  reports,  texts,  voice  messages,  social  media  messages,  pictures,  other 
documents, or anything else that might help convince the judge that I need a Final 
Protective Order. I may bring paper copies of any information I want the judge to 
see from my cell phone or other electronic device, such as screen shots of social 
media posts, pictures, texts, and emails. 

D.    I understand that if I do not attend the hearing, or if I file a request to cancel the 
protective order, the court can dismiss the Temporary Protective Order so that it 
will no longer have any effect. 

E.     I  understand  that  a  law  enforcement  officer  will  give  Defendant  a copy  of  this 
Petition, if Defendant can be found, and that Defendant will receive other relevant 
court papers even if the file is “sealed.” 

F.     I understand that the court will give primary consideration to my safety and the 

safety of other persons I have asked to be protected.   

G.     I understand that the Final Protective Order could be in place for up to one year.  
I also understand that if the Final Protective Order is granted, it may be extended 
beyond one year by filing for an extension before it expires. 

H.        I  understand  that  if  I  believe  Defendant  has  violated  the  Temporary  or  Final 
Protective Order, I can call law enforcement for assistance.  I also can bring this 
to  the  court's  attention  by  filing  with  the  clerk  of  court  an  "Affidavit  to  Start 
Contempt Proceedings." This form is available at the clerk of court's office and on 
the Iowa Judicial Branch website. 

I.      I  understand  that  if  a  Temporary  or  Final  Protective  Order  is  issued,  law 
enforcement  officers  can  use  every  reasonable  means  to  enforce  the  order, 
including arresting Defendant for violating the order.  I understand that, if a court 
finds that Defendant has violated the protective order, Defendant could be put in 
jail and have to pay a fine.  I also understand that I could be arrested, jailed, and 
fined if I initiate or voluntarily maintain any contact with Defendant in violation of 
the order, or if I otherwise violate the protective order. 

J.    I understand that requesting a protective order is a serious legal action.  If I want 
to change any part of the protective order, I should go back and tell the judge.  I 
should file with the clerk of court a "Request to Modify, Cancel, or Extend an Iowa 
Code chapter 236A Final Protective Order."  This form is available at the clerk of 
court's office and on the Iowa Judicial Branch website.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
