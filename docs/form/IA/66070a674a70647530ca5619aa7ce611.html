I.  General information 

The Iowa Judicial Branch provides this guide.  For an overview of divorce and important rules, see Divorce | 
Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov). 

Important: Clerks of court and court staff cannot give you legal advice.   

A.  Terminology 

 

 
 

“Dependent adult children” includes persons age 18 or older who because of a physical or mental 
condition are unable to fully protect their interests or who require assistance in meeting their essential 
needs. 
“Dissolution of marriage” means the same thing as “divorce.” 
“Divorce Decree” or “Decree” means a “Decree of Dissolution of Marriage.” You are not divorced until 
a judge approves and files a Decree. 
“EDMS” is Iowa’s electronic document and case management system. 
“eFile System” is a part of EDMS; you will use it to file and review your documents. 

 
 
  The “Iowa Rules of Electronic Procedure,” in chapter 16 of the Iowa Court Rules, govern the 

electronic filing of documents in the Iowa court system. 
“Legal advice” means strategy that is specific to your case.  Only attorneys can provide legal advice.  
Court staff cannot provide legal advice.  Court staff can provide legal “information” on where to find 
forms, instructions, and other general topics about the courts. 
“Minor child” in Iowa means a person under the age of 18 years. 
“Party” or “parties” is another way to refer to Petitioner and Respondent in the case. 
“Petitioner” is the spouse who files the Petition to start a divorce case.  
“Respondent” is the other spouse who receives the Petition.  These titles do not change.  

 

 
 
 
 

B.  Who should use this guide 

This guide is for self-represented litigants in a divorce case who do not have minor or dependent adult 
children.  A self-represented (also called pro se) litigant is someone who has not hired an attorney for 
representation for all parts of the divorce process. 

However, self-represented litigants can have limited attorney help: 

 

Iowa Legal Aid provides free legal advice or representation for people who meet certain income and 
other qualifications. 

  Some attorneys provide help for free (pro bono) or less than their normal rate (low bono). 
  Some attorneys provide help with part, but not all, of a legal matter, which may be called “unbundled” 

or “limited scope” services or representation. 

C.  Who should not use this guide 

 

 
 

If you have minor or dependent children, use the Guide for Representing Yourself in an Iowa Divorce 
with Children. 
If you have or will have an attorney represent you for all of your case, do not use this guide. 
If you use the Iowa Interactive Court Forms guided interviews to create your divorce forms, use the 
instructions provided when you finish the free, easy-to-use interviews. 

Guide to Representing Yourself in an Iowa Divorce Case with no Minor or Dependent Adult Children 

Page 2 of 17 

Note: If you own a business, investments, or real estate, there are likely complex issues to your divorce.  You 
probably should consult an attorney. 

Read this guide carefully.  There are many steps in the divorce process and many complicated issues.  If you 
are uncertain what to do after reading this guide or during your divorce case, you should talk with an attorney. 

Because your divorce case will become public when a judge signs the final Decree of Dissolution of Marriage, 
you must ensure that you protect personally identifiable information during your case.  For more information, 
see Protect Personal Information | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov). 

 

D.  Before you start 

E.  Court forms 

If you represent yourself, you must use the approved court forms from Chapter 17 of the Iowa Court Rules.  
The forms for divorce without children are in rule 17.100. 

You can get these free, approved court forms from the Iowa Judicial Branch website in two formats: 
  PDF forms to fill in online or print out: Court Forms | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov).   
  Guided interviews that complete the forms for you based on answers you give to specific questions.  

Iowa Interactive Court Forms | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov).  If you use the online guided 
interviews, you do not need this guide. 

Carefully read the specific instructions on each form.  If you do not understand how to use a form or do not 
know if you should use a form, talk to an attorney. 

Note: It is illegal to sign another person’s signature on any court form or other legal paper. 
 

F.  Special requests 

You must make any special requests before the judge signs the Decree. 

1. 

2. 

If you think counseling (also called conciliation) may save the marriage, you may request it.  You can 
ask for it in the Petition, in the Answer, or during the case in a Motion. 
If you want spousal support (alimony), a share of your spouse’s pension, or other property, you must 
ask for it before the judge files your Decree. 

G.  Fees 

There is a fee for filing a Petition.  See Civil Court Fees | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov) or ask the 
clerk of court in your county for information. 

If you believe you cannot afford the filing fee, the court might allow you to postpone your fee payment.  To ask 
the court to postpone (defer) payment of the filing fee, fill in and file an Application and Affidavit to Defer 
Payment of Costs fee 09).

H.  Register for electronic filing 

All documents in the Iowa court system are filed electronically.  You must be registered on the eFile system to 
submit documents to the court unless the court excuses you from electronic filing requirements.  Select 
Registered Filer for your role.  Instructions are at eFile Instructions | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov) 

If you are unable to receive and read new electronic filings promptly 

If you do not have a computer or internet access at home, you may apply to the court to be excused from 
electronic filing requirements.  If excused, you will file your papers at the clerk of court office. 

To be excused from filing electronically: 

  You must apply to the court for an exception from electronic filing requirements. 
  You must have a good reason to be excused. 
  The court must grant you permission to be excused. 

I.  Service of court papers 

When you file documents, you must serve a copy of the documents on your spouse or your spouse’s 
attorney.  
 

If a party is registered for electronic filing, the eFile system provides electronic service.  It notifies the 
party of new filings by a notice of electronic filing posted on the Notifications page of the eFile 
accounts.  
If one party is excused from filing electronically (not registered), the other party must serve a paper 
copy of the document. 

 

Note: You must check the filings on your case in the eFile system regularly. 

J.  Reference materials  

The following materials will help you through the divorce process.  They can be found on the Iowa Judicial 
Branch or the Iowa Legislature websites.

to Defer Costs (form 109), you must use the county sheriff to deliver the forms to your spouse. 

  Option 3:  Service by someone else delivering the papers to your spouse. 

Option 1: Service by personal delivery 

You can hand the forms to your spouse in person or send the forms to your spouse by regular mail.  Use 
personal service only if your spouse is willing to sign an Acceptance of Service (form 105). 

1.  Complete the top part of the Acceptance of Service (form 105). 
2.  When you give your spouse the Petition, have your spouse complete and sign the bottom part of 

the Acceptance of Service and give it back to you. 

3.  File the signed Acceptance of Service. 

a.  See step 1(b) “For an existing lawsuit” under “File the Documents” at eFile Instructions | 

b. 

Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov). 
If you are excused from filing electronically, make a copy of the form for your records and 
take the acceptance of service that your spouse signed to the clerk of court for filing. 

Option 2:  Service by a sheriff or process server 

You can ask the county sheriff or a process server to serve the forms on your spouse.  Use this method if 
you do not want to deliver the documents yourself or if the court approved an Application to Defer Costs 
(form 109). 

Complete the Directions for Service of Original Notice (form 106).  Give the county sheriff or process 
server two copies of the following forms: 
  Original Notice (form 104) 
  Petition (form 101) 
  Directions for Service (form 106) 
  Protected Information Disclosure (form 111)  

The sheriff or process server will file “proof of service” after you pay the service fee.  “Proof of service” 
confirms for the court that your spouse has properly received the court papers. 

Option 3:  Service by someone else 

You can have another person who is not a sheriff or process server deliver the papers to your spouse. 

1.  The person performing service must fill out an Affidavit of Service (form 110). 
2.  Either you or that person must file the affidavit soon after the papers are delivered to your 

spouse. 

Service if you do not know where your spouse is 

If you do not know where your spouse is, you can ask the court for permission to give notice to your spouse 
by publication in a newspaper. 

A court will give you permission to give notice by publication in a newspaper if you have made reasonable 
efforts to find your spouse.  For example: 

1.  Contacting your spouse’s parents, brothers, sisters, friends, former employer, or people your spouse 

worked with. 

Guide to Representing Yourself in an Iowa Divorce Case with no Minor or Dependent Adult Children 

Page 7 of 17 

2.  Checking local or area phone books or phone books where you think your spouse might be living. 
3.  Searching for your spouse using the internet or social media.  (If you do not know how to do this, go 

to your local library and ask a librarian for help.) 

4.  Asking an attorney to help you. 

If you still cannot find your spouse: 

1.  Mail a copy of the Original Notice (form 104), the Petition (form 101), and the Protected Information 

Disclosure (form 111) to your spouse’s last known address. 

2.  File a Motion and Affidavit to Serve by Publication (form 107).  See Filing in an Existing Case for 

instructions. 

The court may schedule a hearing on your Motion and Affidavit.  If so, the court will notify you of the date and 
time for the hearing.  You must attend the hearing. 

Note: Asking for service by publication in a newspaper does not guarantee that a judge will let you serve by 
publication. 

If your Motion and Affidavit is approved, a notice of electronic filing is posted to your eFile notifications page 
indicating that your Motion and Affidavit has been approved: 

1.  Print and mail a copy of the Motion and Affidavit to your spouse’s last known address. 
2.  Fill out an Original Notice by Publication (form 108) and take it to a newspaper of general circulation 

published in the county where the Petition was filed. 

Important: You must closely follow the instructions for form 108. 
 

3.  After you take the Original Notice by publication to the newspaper, promptly mail a copy of the Notice, 

Petition, and Protected Information Disclosure to your spouse’s last known mailing address. 

4.  File an Affidavit of Mailing Notice (form 125). 

Your spouse must file an Answer.

the divorce papers  

III.  Respondent instructions—If your spouse has filed for divorce and you have received 

If you received a divorce petition (and there are no children involved in your divorce), you are the 
Respondent. 

There are certain things you must do as Respondent to protect your legal interests during the divorce 
process. 

Important:  You have to file an Answer to the Petition within 20 days of either: 

  The date the county sheriff or process server served you with an original notice and a copy of the 

Petition (form 101). 

  The date your spouse filed the Acceptance of Service (form 105) with the clerk of court. 
  The date an affidavit of service was filed with the clerk of court. 

If you fail to file an Answer within 20 days, the court may file a Decree without your input. 

Whether or not your spouse is represented by an attorney, you may still want to talk to or hire an attorney to 
help you with the divorce process.  An attorney can only help one party in a divorce case. 

A.  Carefully read all papers served on you. 

It is important to carefully read the Petition and Original Notice to understand what your spouse (Petitioner) is 
asking. 

You (Respondent) might also receive other papers (court orders or notices) filed in your case that tell you 
important steps or things you must do during the divorce process, such as: 

  The date for a court hearing. 
  Required information you must provide to your spouse and the court and deadlines to provide the 

information. 
  Attend mediation. 

B.  Fill in and sign your forms 

You can get the forms you need from the following sources: 

 

Iowa Interactive Court Forms | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov).  If you use the interactive court 
forms to create your forms for you, you do not need this guide. 

  The Iowa Judicial Branch website at Court Forms | Iowa Judicial Branch (iowacourts.gov). 
  Chapter 17 of the Iowa Court Rules.  The free forms for divorce without children are in rule 17.100. 

Carefully read the specific instructions on each form for how to fill the form.  If you still do not understand 
something after reading the instructions, you should contact an attorney. 

Note: If you want spousal support (alimony), a share of your spouse’s pension, or other property, you must 
ask for it.  You cannot get it after a judge files your Decree. 

If you are a Respondent without an attorney, you must file either form 115 or 116 to answer the Petition.

IV. What to do next 

There are many things that parties must do to finalize a dissolution.  These things should be done early in the 
divorce process so that the court can issue a Decree upon conclusion of the waiting period or before a 
hearing or trial date is set. 

  Check the filings on your case in the eFile system regularly. 
  Attend any programs or counseling the court requires, such as an educational program about divorce 
or a mediation session with your spouse.  These requirements vary by judicial district; you should 
carefully read all information you receive from the court or the clerk of court. 
  Keep track of any deadlines, court hearing dates, or trial dates set by the court. 

Under Iowa law, there is a 90-day waiting period before a judge can approve and file the Decree.  The 90 
days usually begin on the latest of the following dates: 

  When the Petition and Original Notice are served on Respondent by a sheriff or civil process server. 
  When Petitioner files the acceptance of service (form 105). 
 
  After court-ordered counseling is completed (if so ordered). 

If Petitioner serves notice by publication in a newspaper, when the final (third) publication is made. 

In a case of emergency or necessity, the court could shorten the 90-day waiting period.  Judges require a 
very good reason for shortening the waiting period.  To apply, file a Motion (form 122) explaining to the court 
why you think the waiting period should be shortened in your case.  For more information, see Iowa Code 
section 598.19.   

A.  Other steps before a divorce is finalized 

  There are many things that parties must do to finalize a dissolution.  These things should be done 
early in the divorce process so that the court can issue a Decree upon conclusion of the waiting 
period or before a hearing or trial date is setEach spouse must file a Financial Affidavit for a 
Dissolution of Marriage with no Minor or Dependent Adult Children (form 124).  This gives the court 
information about their property, debts, and income levels.  You will not get a Decree until both 
spouses complete the Financial Affidavit. 

Note: If you and your spouse do not have assets or debts to split, you both can apply to waive this 
requirement.  File a Motion (form 122) and check box 1(A)(7) “Other request.” Explain why this 
requirement should be waived.

B.  What one or both spouses should do during the waiting period 

 

 

 

 

If you and your spouse agree on how to divide your property, assets, and debts, complete and file a 
Settlement Agreement for a Dissolution of Marriage (form 128).  Work together to fill out the 
Settlement Agreement. 
If you are changing the title to any real estate as part of your divorce, you may want to contact an 
attorney to get advice. 
If you or your spouse need something that requires a temporary order from the court, you may file a 
Motion (form 122) to ask the court for what you want. 

o 

If you want counseling (also called conciliation), spousal support (alimony), a share of your 
spouse’s pension, or other property, you must ask for it.  You must ask for these things 
before a judge files your Decree. 

If your spouse files a Motion and you disagree with what your spouse is asking the court to do, file a 
Response to a Motion (form 123) to tell the court that you disagree with your spouse’s Motion. 
o  The court will likely file an order setting a hearing date, time, and location.  Check the 

Notifications page of your eFile account for the time and date.  If you are excused from filing 
electronically, the clerk’s office will mail you a notice of the hearing. 

o  You must go to the hearing.  If you do not show up for the hearing, the court will not give you 

the things you request in your Motion.

V.  How to get a Decree of Dissolution of Marriage 

You and your spouse are not divorced until the court approves and files a Decree of Dissolution of Marriage, 
also called a “Decree” or “Divorce Decree.” 

There are three ways to get a Decree: 

A.  Settlement Agreement: If you and your spouse agree on how to divide your property and debts and 

B.  Trial: If you and your spouse do not agree on how to settle your divorce, and the court decides your

issues for you at a hearing or during a trial.  

C.  Default Decree: If Respondent did not file an Answer by the deadline or either party stops 

participating in the divorce proceedings, the court may enter a Default Decree in favor of the other 
party.

Settlement Agreement 
(form 128) 

Required if you and your 
spouse agree on the 
terms of your divorce. 

If you and your spouse agree on how to divide your property and debts, you should work together to prepare 
and file a Settlement Agreement (form 128).  This is the most efficient way to finalize your divorce. 

If the court has questions about the Settlement Agreement, the court will set a hearing and file an 
order telling you when the hearing is.  Check the Notifications page of your eFile account for the time 
and date.  If you are excused from filing electronically, the clerk’s office will mail you a notice of the 
hearing. 
If the court does not have questions and the waiting period is passed, the court will approve and file a 
Decree based on the Settlement Agreement. 

If you have a hearing 

Bring copies of all your filings, including: 

  The Financial Affidavit (form 124). 
  The Settlement Agreement (form 128) signed by you and your spouse. 
If filed, the Motion (form 122) to shorten the 90-day waiting period.

If you and your spouse do not agree on the terms of your divorce or how to settle your divorce, you should file 
a Request for Relief (form 127). 

The court will set a trial date and file an order telling you when the trial is.  Check the Notifications page of 
your eFile account for the time and date of the trial.  If excused from electronic filing, the order will be mailed 
to you. 

When you appear before a judge at the trial

the trial. 

The judge will ask both of you questions about the issues on which you disagree.  The judge will make a final 
decision on these issues for you, including on how to divide your property and debts if you cannot agree on 
them yourselves. 

C.  Default Decree  

If either spouse misses a deadline or stops participating in the divorce proceeding, the other spouse can ask 
the court for a Decree by default.  The court will then likely set a hearing. 

Respondent’s deadline for filing an Answer is 20 days after either: 

  The date the county sheriff or process server served the Original Notice (form 104) and a copy of the 

Petition (form 101). 

  The date Petitioner filed the Acceptance of Service (form 105) with the clerk of court. 
  The date the Affidavit of Service of Original Notice and Petition for Dissolution of Marriage (form 110) 

was filed with the clerk of court.

VI. After the judge files the Decree 

A.  One party must complete a “Report of Dissolution of Marriage or Annulment” form 

After the judge has filed the Decree, one party to the divorce must complete a “Report of Dissolution of 
Marriage or Annulment Form” from the Iowa Department of Public Health.   

1.  Go to the clerk of court office in the county where the dissolution of marriage was finalized. 
2.  Ask the clerk for the form. 
3.  Fill in the form, but leave items 18 through 22 blank for the clerk of court to complete. 
4.  Give the form back to the clerk of court at the counter. 

B.  Things you may want to do 

 

 

 

If you have any credit cards or joint bank accounts in the names of both spouses, you may 
want to close them.  Creditors often try to collect debts from anyone whose name is on the account, 
even if the Decree orders one person to pay the debt. 
If the Decree gives a party a portion of the other party’s retirement account or pension, you 
must have a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) prepared.  A QDRO is complicated.  
Contact the financial institution holding the account or ask an attorney for help. 
If you have real estate, you may have to change the title according to the Decree.  You should 
talk to an attorney because this is a complicated and important step in the divorce process.  You want 
to be sure to do this correctly.
