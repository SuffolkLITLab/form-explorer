 If checked, the employer/income withholder must provide a copy of this form to the employee/obligor.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYERS/INCOME WITHHOLDERS 

State-specific contact and withholding information can be found on the Federal Employer Services website located at 
www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/state-income-withholding-contacts-and-program-requirements. 

Employers/income withholders may use OCSE's Child Support Portal (https://ocsp.acf.hhs.gov/csp/) to provide 
information about employees who are eligible to receive a lump sum payment, have terminated employment, and to 
provide contacts, addresses, and other information about their company. 

 

Priority:  Withholding for support has priority over any other legal process under State law against the same income 
(section 466(b)(7) of the Social Security Act). If a federal tax levy is in effect, please notify the sender. 

Combining Payments: When remitting payments to an SDU or tribal CSE agency, you may combine withheld amounts 
from more than one employee/obligor's income in a single payment.  You must, however, separately identify each 
employee/obligor's portion of the payment. 

Payments To SDU: You must send child support payments payable by income withholding to the appropriate SDU or to a 
tribal CSE agency. If this IWO instructs you to send a payment to an entity other than an SDU (e.g., payable to the 
custodial party, court, or attorney), you must check the box above and return this notice to the sender. Exception: If this 
IWO was sent by a court, attorney, or private individual/entity and the initial order was entered before January 1, 1994 or 
the order was issued by a tribal CSE agency, you must follow the “Remit payment to” instructions on this form.

Reporting the Pay Date: You must report the pay date when sending the payment. The pay date is the date on which the 
amount was withheld from the employee/obligor's wages. You must comply with the law of the state (or tribal law if 
applicable) of the employee/obligor's principal place of employment regarding time periods within which you must 
implement the withholding and forward the support payments. 

Multiple IWOs: If there is more than one IWO against this employee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IWOs 
due to federal, state, or tribal withholding limits, you must honor all IWOs to the greatest extent possible, giving priority to 
current support before payment of any past-due support. Follow the state or tribal law/procedure of the employee/obligor's 
principal place of employment to determine the appropriate allocation method. 

Lump Sum Payments: You may be required to notify a state or tribal CSE agency of upcoming lump sum payments to 
this employee/obligor such as bonuses, commissions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to determine if you are 
required to report and/or withhold lump sum payments. 

Liability: If you have any doubts about the validity of this IWO, contact the sender.  If you fail to withhold income from the 
employee/obligor's income as the IWO directs, you are liable for both the accumulated amount you should have withheld 
and any penalties set by state or tribal law/procedure. 

31 

Anti-discrimination: You are subject to a fine determined under state or tribal law for discharging an employee/obligor 
from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against an employee/obligor because of this IWO. 
32 

Withholding Limits:  You may not withhold more than the lesser of:  1) the amounts allowed by the Federal Consumer 
Credit Protection Act (CCPA) [15 USC §1673 (b)]; or 2) the amounts allowed by the law of the state of the employee/ 
obligor's principal place of employment, if the place of employment is in a state; or the tribal law of the employee/obligor's 
principal place of employment if the place of employment is under tribal jurisdiction.  Disposable income is the net 
income after mandatory deductions such as: state, federal, local taxes; Social Security taxes; statutory pension 
contributions; and Medicare taxes.  The federal limit is 50% of the disposable income if the obligor is supporting another 
family and 60% of the disposable income if the obligor is not supporting another family.  However, those limits increase 
5% --to 55% and 65% --if the arrears are greater than 12 weeks.  If permitted by the state or tribe, you may deduct a fee 
for administrative costs.  The combined support amount and fee may not exceed the limit indicated in this section. 

Depending upon applicable state or tribal law, you may need to consider amounts paid for health care premiums in 
determining disposable income and applying appropriate withholding limits. 

Arrears Greater Than 12 Weeks? If the Order Information section does not indicate that the arrears are greater than 
12 weeks, then the employer should calculate the CCPA limit using the lower percentage.

Encryption Requirements: 
When communicating this form through electronic transmission, precautions must be taken to ensure the security of the 
data.  Child support agencies are encouraged to use the electronic applications provided by the federal Office of Child 
Support Enforcement.  Other electronic means, such as encrypted attachments to emails, may be used if the encryption 
method is compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 (FIPS PUB 140-2). 

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
This information collection and associated responses are conducted in accordance with 45 CFR 303.100 of the Child Support 
Enforcement Program.  This form is designed to provide uniformity and standardization.  Public reporting for this collection of 
 
information is estimated to average two to five minutes per response.  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person 
is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
