In this Guide, three symbols are used to indicate whether information is specific to electronic filing, specific to 
paper filing, or applies to all cases whether electronic or in paper:

Introduction

 

 

 

 

 

 

Important:  Read all information marked with this arrow, whether you file electronically or in paper. 

If you represent yourself (without an attorney) in a child support modification case, you must use the court-
approved forms identified in this Guide and contained in Chapter 17 of the Iowa Court Rules.  These forms 
are available free of charge in fillable and savable format on the Iowa Judicial Branch website:  
www.iowacourts.gov. 

If you do not understand how to use these forms, or do not know if you should use these forms, talk 
to an attorney. 

  These forms must be used whether the filings in your case will be electronic or in paper.  If you are unsure 
whether your county, or the county where your case is filed, accepts electronic filing, check the map 
available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at:  http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Overview/ or call the 
clerk of court office in your county.  You can find a directory of clerk of court offices at:  
http://www.iowacourts.gov/Administration/Directories/ . 

If the county where this case is filed accepts electronic filing, you must file electronically unless you get 
permission from the court to file in paper.  Contact the clerk of court if you are unable to file electronically. 

  The forms identified in this Guide are for changing child support only.  You cannot these forms to 

change child custody, physical care, or visitation arrangements.  If you want to change one of these things, 
you should talk to an attorney. 

  Read this Guide carefully.  This Guide will help you through the steps for modifying child support, but 

many issues can be complicated, and you may need to talk to an attorney. 

  Submission of these forms does not guarantee your application to change child support will be granted 

without a hearing or further questions from the judge. 

  Even if you both agree on the terms for modifying child support, you must have a judge approve the 
change in child support and go through many steps in the court process to modify child support. 

If you are still uncertain what to do after reading this Guide, you should talk with an attorney.  An attorney 
can help you with all or just some of the steps in a child support modification. 

Important:  An Iowa court can only decide child support matters if it has jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is very 
complicated.  If the child support to be modified was not entered in Iowa, an Iowa judge may not be able to 
change child support.  If Iowa does not have jurisdiction to enter an order, the order may not be good.  If the 
child support order to be modified was not entered in Iowa, you should contact an attorney. 

  Child support is not changed until a judge signs a final “Decree.” 

In a child support modification, the parties keep their titles, “Petitioner” or “Respondent,” from their original 
divorce actions.  In child support modification cases, “Applicant” is the party who started the modification 
case by filing an Application to Modify Child Support (form 301).  Either Petitioner or Respondent can be 
“Applicant.”  The “other party” sometimes refers to the party (either Petitioner or Respondent) who receives 
service of the Application.  Part VI of this Guide defines many other legal terms you should know.

  These court forms (301-328) can only be used to increase, decrease, or stop child support payments. 

  A person can ask the court to change child support only if something changes so that the current amount of 

support is wrong. 

  You can use these forms to stop child support payments if you have been paying child support, but you now 

have custody of the children or the children are no longer eligible to receive child support.  (For example, a 
child turned 18 years of age and is no longer in school.) 

  You cannot modify child support by publishing Notice. 

  Child support may have been set in a divorce Decree; it also could be set in a custody case. 

  The Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) may also file a case to set child support.  If CSRU is involved in 
your child support modification case, you must also provide each form you file to the CSRU office that 
serves the county where your child support case is filed.  (See section VIII of this Guide for information on 
CSRU offices.)

using a different amount. 

  Using the Guidelines can be very complicated, and you may need to talk to an attorney. 

  CSRU provides a child support estimator on its website that you may use to obtain an estimate of the 

amount of support. 

  Child support laws are very complicated.  The laws are in chapters 252A to 252K of the Iowa Code.  You 

can find the Iowa Code in public libraries, or on the Iowa legislature’s website.  Other statutes and rules also 
deal with child support, including Chapter 9 of the Iowa Court Rules.  You should talk to an attorney if 
you are having difficulty understanding these laws and rules. 

 

 

It is illegal to sign another person’s signature on any court form or other legal paper. 

Important:  Clerks of court and court staff cannot give you legal advice.

  Electronic Filing (EDMS) 

 

If your case will be or is filed in a county that uses electronic filing, you are required to register and 
electronically file your documents using the Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). In 
exceptional circumstances, you may apply to the court for an exemption (to be excused), from electronic 
filing requirements. 

  Because documents in child support modification cases will become public case when filed with the 

court, it is critical that you understand and know your responsibility for these two things: 

  What information is protected (or may or should be kept private); and 
  How to redact (or remove) protected information from the papers (or forms) that you file in your 

case. 

  See Chapter 16 Rules Pertaining to the Use of the Electronic Document Management System at:  

http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Overview/.  Refer to Division VI of Chapter 16 for rules on protecting 
private information. 

  You must still personally serve the other party with a copy of your Application and Original Notice, even if 

you are filing electronically.  After the Application and Original Notice documents are personally served, 
whenever you electronically file an additional document in your case, EDMS will serve a copy of that 
document on the other registered party or the other party’s attorney if there is one. 

  The Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) will indicate if the other party is excused from electronic filing 

requirements, in which case, you must mail a copy or serve in paper a copy of the document on the other 
party if he or she does not have an attorney. 

  Even if you are filing electronically, most child support modification forms require you to certify the 

information you are providing by handwriting your signature on the form.  These forms must then be 
scanned in and electronically filed. 

  To view the modification forms, you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed.  Go to:  

http://get.adobe.com/reader/. 

  Paper Filing 

 

 

If the county in which the Application is filed uses electronic filing, you must receive permission from the 
court before you can file in paper. 

  Some instructions, and some forms, are different if you are filing in paper rather than electronically. 

  Whenever you file a paper at the clerk of court office, you must deliver a copy of that paper to the other 
party or the other party’s attorney. You should also keep a copy for yourself.  The only exception is the 
Confidential Information Form (303):  Do not give a copy of that form to the other party. 

If CSRU is involved in your child support modification case, you must also provide each form you file to 
the CSRU office that serves the county where your child support case is filed.  (See section VIII of this 
Guide for information on CSRU offices.) 

  Because documents in child support modification cases become public case when filed with the court,  it 

is critical that you understand and know your responsibility for these two things: 

  What information is protected (or may or should be kept private); and 
  How to redact (or remove) protected information from the papers (or forms) that you file in your 

case. 

  Be sure to print clearly when filling in paper forms.

II.  How to Begin a Child Support Modification 

A.  Applicant must fill in and sign the forms required to start the process to modify child 

support. 

  You can get the forms you need free of charge and in fillable and savable format from the Iowa Judicial 

Branch website at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/For_the_Public/Representing_Yourself_in_Court/DivorceFamily_Law/Forms/. 
The forms are also in Chapter 17 of the Iowa Court Rules. 

  Carefully read the specific instructions on each form.  Some forms are different if you are filing in paper 
rather than electronically.  If you do not understand something, you should contact an attorney. Do not 
contact court staff about how to fill out forms. 

  Type or print clearly on each form.  You should use a blue ink pen (if possible) to sign each form that 

requires a handwritten signature. 

Here is a list of the forms a self-represented Applicant must use to start the child support modification 
process: 

  301  

  302 

 

303 

  304 

Application to Modify Child Support 

Coversheet for an Application to Modify Child Support.  Use only if filing in paper; not 
for electronic filing. 

Confidential Information Form.  Use only if filing in paper; not for electronic filing.  
Each party filing in paper must provide the clerk of court personal identifying information on

 

 

If you are unable to proceed electronically, you must receive permission from the court to file in paper.  
Contact the clerk of court in the county where the Application will be filed for more information on being 
excused from electronic filing. 

  With your Application (form 301), you must also file an Original Notice (form 304) and a Protected 

Information Disclosure (form 311) with the full version of any protected information or other information 
you have redacted or omitted from the Application. 

If filing electronically, you will receive a Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) when the clerk of court has 
approved the filing of your Application. 

  Log in to your eFile account and download and print your Application, Original Notice, and Protected 

Information Disclosure so that you can serve (deliver them to) the other party. 

  For help finding and downloading your Application, Original Notice, and Protected Information 

Disclosure, please see the “My Filings Reference Guide” at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Training_Documents/. 
 

  Filing your case in paper. 

 

If the county where you file your Application does not yet accept electronic filing, you must proceed in 
paper.  If the county does accept electronic filing, you must proceed electronically, unless you have 
received permission from the court to file in paper. 

  With your Application, you must also file a Cover Sheet for an Application to Modify Child Support (form 

302), an Original Notice (form 304a), and a Confidential Information Form (form 303).  It is also 
recommended that you file a Protected Information Disclosure (form 311) with the complete version of 
any protected information or other information that you have redacted or omitted from the Application. 

  Forms 301 and 304a and, if applicable, 311: Make two copies if you can deliver copies of these forms to 
the other party in-person or by mail. Make three copies if you are going to ask the county sheriff or a civil 
process server to deliver these forms to the other party.  If CSRU is involved in your case, you must also 
serve CSRU a copy of the Application and Original Notice. 

  Forms 302 and 303: You do not have to make photocopies of these forms. 

  Note about making photocopies:  You should make your photocopies before you go to the courthouse to 
file your papers.  It is expensive to make photocopies at the clerk of court office. It is cheaper to make the 
copies at a business that makes photocopies or at a public library. 

  Take the original forms you filled in and the photocopies to the clerk of court office in your county.  Tell 

the clerk at the counter you are filing an Application to Modify Child Support. 

  Give the clerk at the counter the original forms and the photocopies of these forms: 

 
 
 
 
 

Application to Modify Child Support 

 301 
 302  Coversheet for an Application to Modify Child Support 
 303  Confidential Information Form (Do not make copies of this form.) 
 304a  Original Notice 
 311 

Protected Information Disclosure, if applicable 

  Pay the filing fee, or file form 309.  (See above.)  The clerk at the counter can tell you the amount of the 
filing fee. See the term “Fees” in part VI of this Guide for a list of the fees you might have to pay during 
the child support modification process. The Iowa legislature sets these fees and periodically raises them, 
so check with the clerk’s office to confirm the current filing fee. 

  The clerk of court will sign the Original Notice (form 304a).  You will have to serve this form on (deliver it 

to) the other party.  (See section C, below.) 

  The clerk at the counter will time-stamp each of the copies (original and photocopies).

C.  Serve (deliver) the Original Notice (form 304 if filing electronically; form 304a if filing in 

paper), a copy of the Application (form 301), and, if applicable, the Protected Information 
Disclosure (form 311) on the other party. (See the definition of “Serve (Service)” on page 22.) 

  Applicant must notify the other party that Applicant has filed an Application to Modify Child Support. 

  Some person other than a parent may get child support in your case, for example a grandparent or a 

sibling who is caring for the child. 

If someone else gets child support for your child, you have to give that person a copy of the Original 
Notice of the Application and copies of papers that you file. 

If the Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) is involved in your case, you must also serve CSRU a copy of 
the Original Notice and of the Application. 

  For both paper and electronic filers: 

Important:  Applicant has 90 days after filing the Application to serve the Application on the other party.  
If Applicant fails to meet this deadline the Application to Modify Child Support will be dismissed. 

  Options for completing step C: you have two options for completing service: 

  Service Option 1:  You can hand the forms to the other party yourself, or send the forms to the other 
party by regular mail.  You must also get the other party to sign an “Acceptance of Service” (form 
305; see below).  After the other party signs the Acceptance of Service form, you must meet the 
requirement for “proof of service” by:

  Service Option 2:  You can ask the county sheriff or other civil process server to serve the forms on 
the other party.  Note: If you filed an Application & Affidavit to Defer Costs (form 309) and the court 
approved it, you must have the county sheriff serve the forms.

  Original Notice (form 304 or 304a) 
  Application (form 301) 
  Directions for Service (form 306) 
  Protected Information Disclosure (form 311), if applicable. 

  Tell the sheriff or process server to deliver the Original Notice, Application, and Protected Information 

Disclosure to the other party. 

  The sheriff or other process server will file the “proof of service” with the clerk of court after you pay 
the service fee. If the court granted your Application to Defer Costs (form 309), the county sheriff 
must be the one who delivers the forms to the other party. 

 

If the Child Support Recovery Unit (CSRU) is involved in your case, you must serve CSRU a copy of 
the Original Notice (form 304 or 304a) and of the Application (form 301).  You should also include an 
Acceptance of Service form (form 305).  Mail copies of these three forms to the CSRU office that serves 
the county where you child support modification case is filed.  CSRU offices are very busy.  You should 
wait a reasonable number of days for CSRU to file the Acceptance of Service.  Then check with the clerk 
of court where the Application is filed to learn whether CSRU has filed an Acceptance of Service form.  If 
CSRU has not filed an Acceptance of Service form, you must have the Polk County Sheriff (in Des 
Moines) or a civil process server deliver the Original Notice and Application to the Iowa Attorney 
General’s office in Des Moines.  The addresses of all CSRU regional offices, the Attorney General’s 
office, and the Polk County Sheriff’s office are in section VIII of this Guide.

III.  What to do if You have Received an Application to Modify Child Support 

A.  Carefully read the papers served on you (an Application and Original Notice). 

 

It is important to read the papers carefully to understand what Applicant is asking for in the Application. 

  You (the other party) might also receive other papers (court “orders”) filed in your case that tell you things 

you must do as part of the child support modification process. Examples of these orders are: 

  Setting the date for the pretrial conference, 
  Requiring each party to give financial or other information to the court, or 
  Requiring attendance at mediation (in some counties). 

  Even if Applicant is not represented by an attorney, you may still talk to or hire an attorney to help you 

with the child support modification process. 

 

 

If the Application is filed in a county that uses electronic filing, you are required to register and 
electronically file your Answer and other documents using the Electronic Document Management System 
(EDMS). See “How to Register Pro Se (Self Represented) for eFiling” at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/wfData/files/EDMS/OnlineDocumentation/HowtoRegesterProSe_SelfReprese
ntedeFiler.pdf.  See Chapter 16 Rules Pertaining to the Use of the Electronic Document Management 
System at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/wfdata/files/EDMS/OnlineDocumentation/C214hapter16Rules102213.pdf. 

In exceptional circumstances, you may apply for and be granted an exemption or be excused from 
electronic filing requirements. Contact the clerk of court in the county where the Application was filed for 
information on exemptions from electronic filing. 

  Whenever you electronically file a document in your case, EDMS will serve a copy of that document on a 
registered party or the registered party’s attorney.  The Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) will indicate if 
the party is exempt from the electronic filing requirements, in which case, you must mail or serve in paper 
a copy of the document on the party if he or she does not have an attorney. 
 

B.  Filing your Answer to the Application. 

  Within 20 days after receiving a copy of the Application and Original Notice, you must file an Answer to 
the Application with the court.  If you fail to file an Answer within 20 days, the court may grant a Decree 
modifying child support without your input. 

  You can get the forms you need, free of charge, from the Iowa court system’s website at: 

http://www.iowacourts.gov/For_the_Public/Representing_Yourself_in_Court/DivorceFamily_Law/Divorce/
Forms__Instructions/index.asp . 

  You should carefully read the instructions on the forms for how to fill them in.  If you still do not 

understand something after reading the instructions, you should contact an attorney. 

  The party receiving an Application to Modify Child Support must use form 315 or form 316 to answer the 

Answer to Application to Modify Child Support.  Use this to file an Answer if you received 
Application to Modify Child Support form 301 from Applicant. 

General Answer.  Use this if you received an Application seeking to change child support, 
but it was not form 301. 

  Decide which form you need.  Then do the following: 

Application: 

  315 

  316 

  Fill out the form. 
  Sign the form.

  Here is a list of forms that either Applicant or the other party can use to complete the steps necessary to 

get a final Decree modifying child support.

form if the other party is “in default.” For example, the other party has not filed an Answer to 
the Application and Applicant wants to ask the court to sign a final Decree modifying child 
support.

  The Child Support Guidelines set the amount of child support.  To use the Guidelines, you have to 
know each parent’s “net monthly income” and how many children of the parties’ relationship the 
parent supports.  Net monthly income is gross income (income before taxes are deducted) with taxes 
and some expenses subtracted.  The Guidelines must be used in setting support unless there is a 
very good reason that the court approves for using a different amount. 

f Applicant and the other party agree how to modify child support payments, you should complete 
together and file a Settlement Agreement (form 328). 

  Work together to fill out the Settlement Agreement. 
  Sign and print the Agreement and proceed with the steps for filing electronically or in paper. 
  You might have to attend educational or mediation programs. The court may require the parties to 

attend an educational program or require a mediation session. These requirements vary by judicial 
district, and you should carefully read all information you receive from the court or the clerk of court.

deadline or has not participated in the modification proceedings. 

  Applicant served the Original Notice and a copy of the Application on the other party (by mail, in-person, 
or by sheriff or process server), and the other party did not file an Answer within 20 days of service or 
filing of an Acceptance of Service (form 305) or Affidavit of Service (form 310). The 20-day period starts 
on:

process server; or, 

  The date Applicant filed the Acceptance of Service (form 305) with the clerk of court; or 
  The date an Affidavit of Service (form 310) was filed with the clerk of court. 

 

If the other party did not file an Answer within the 20-day period, Applicant can ask the court for a Decree 
by default but first must give the other party a 10-day notice in writing. 

  Applicant must first give the other party a 10-day notice in writing that Applicant intends to ask the 

court for a modification Decree by default. 

  To give the other party a 10-day notice, Applicant must file a Notice of Intent to File a Written 

Application for a Default Decree (form 326) and serve a copy of this document on the other party. 
  After Applicant files a Notice of Intent to File a Written Application for a Default Decree (form 326) 

and it is served on the other party, Applicant must wait 10 days from the date of service plus 3 more 
days for mailing.  If the other party does not file an Answer within 13 days, Applicant can ask the 
court for a Decree modifying child support by default. 

  To request a Decree modifying child support by default: 

  Prepare a Motion (form 322) to set a hearing date. On the Motion, check item 1A(2) (“Set a hearing 

date for modification of child support”).

support.  After you complete and file the Agreement, you should: 

  File a Motion for a hearing date on your Agreement. 
  Ask the clerk of court when a judge can meet with you about your Settlement Agreement.  Because 
most courts have very busy schedules, it might be one week (or more) before you can meet with a

  VI.  Terms Used in the Child Support Modification Process 

Acceptance of Service of Original Notice (form 305):  On this form the other party can sign to acknowledge, 
or admit, receiving a copy of the divorce Application and Original Notice from Applicant.  Signing this paper does 
not mean the other party agrees to the modification or anything else that is in the Application.  (Note: the county 
sheriff or other civil process server does not need to serve the Application and Original Notice if the other party 
signs this Acceptance of Service.) 

Affidavit of Mailing Notice (form 325):  This form tells the court that the person mailed a notice to the other 
party.  Applicant or the other party must use this form if he or she asks the court for a final Decree by default. 

Affidavit of Service of Original Notice and Application to Modify Child Support (form 310): Use this form if 
another person who is not a sheriff or process server delivered the Application and Original Notice to the other 
party. 

Answer (form 315 or 316): The other party uses the Answer to respond to what Applicant asks for in the 
Application. 

Applicant:  The person who files the Application to Modify Child Support, asking the court to change a child 
support order. 

Application and Affidavit to Defer Payment of Costs (form 309): This form asks the court for an order to allow 
Applicant to file the Application without paying the filing fee or the costs of service at that time. You might be 
required to pay the fee or costs later. 

Application to Modify Child Support:  The Application (form 301) is a paper Applicant files with the court to 
start a new court case.  It gives the court information about the parties involved in the case, and it tells the court 
what Applicant wants the court to do.  In an Application to Modify Child Support, Applicant asks the court to 
change a child support order. 

Chapter 16 Rules Pertaining to the Use of the Electronic Document Management System (EDMS): These 
are the rules that govern electronic filing, available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website.  See Division VI of the 
Chapter 16 Rules about Protection of Personal Privacy.  Your child support modification case is public, so it is 
critical that you understand what information you must protect from public disclosure and how to redact it from 
documents you file in your case. 

Cover Sheet for an Application to Modify Child Support (form 302):  This form is used only in nonelectronic 
cases (paper filing) and it identifies the type of lawsuit being filed (modification—children involved). It must be 
completed and filed with the Application (form 301). 

Confidential Information Form (303):  This form is used only in non-electronic cases (paper filing).  Iowa law 
requires all parties filing in paper to provide the clerk of court with complete personal identifying information on a 
Confidential Information Form, including full birth dates, Social Security numbers, and full names of children.  The 
clerk of court will keep this form confidential and separate from the divorce case.  This form is not a public record. 

Decree Modifying Child Support:  A judge signs this document that changes child support and ends the child 
support modification case.  By getting together and completing a Settlement Agreement (form 328), the parties 
can tell the judge what they both want the final Decree to say.  The judge will review the Agreement and 
determine the final terms of the modification Decree.  If the parties do not agree, a party can tell the judge what 
the party wants the final Decree to say by filling out and filing a Request for Relief (form 327).  The judge will 
always make the final decision on what the Decree modifying child support will say. 

Default:  A Default or Default Judgment is a ruling from the court that one of the parties did not do something 
that was required during the modification process.  For example, the judge could enter a default judgment if the 
other party did not file an Answer after receiving an Original Notice.  Once the court enters a Default or Default 
Judgment, the court may then issue other orders, including a Decree modifying child support.  Forms 326 and 
327 can be used to get a “Decree by default.” 

Dependent Adult Child:  A child age 18 or older who still requires support from parents.  For example, a child 
March 2014 
 
 

Guide to Representing Yourself in a 
Child Support Modification Case in Iowa 

Page 18 of 28 

who is age 18 but is still in high school, or a child age 18 or older who is in college or is disabled and still needs 
support. 

Directions for Service of Original Notice (form 306):  This form gives information to the county sheriff or other 
civil process server on how and where to serve the Application on the other party.  See “Serve (Service)” below. 

Discovery:  This is the process for the parties to give each other information that explains the facts about child 
support.  You may have to do this by answering questions or providing papers. 

Electronic Document Management System (EDMS):  This is Iowa’s Internet-based court system that allows 
you to electronically file documents and receive filings on your case from other parties and the court.  Electronic 
filing is required in counties that use EDMS, and special court rules apply to cases that are electronically filed.  
You must register to use EDMS.  See the eFiling page on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at: 
https://www.iowacourts.state.ia.us/EFile/ to request an account.  See also “eFile Documents Links” on that page 
for rules, forms, and helpful guides to eFiling processes. 

Electronic Filing (eFiling):  Electronic filing, or “efiling,” is the submission of documents through Iowa’s Internet-
based court system (EDMS).  With electronic filing, you do not take a paper to the courthouse to file it, unless you 
have applied for and have received an exemption (see definition below) from electronic filing. 

Exemption:  All cases are presumed to be electronic unless they are in a county that has not yet implemented 
EDMS.  Under exceptional circumstances, a party may ask the court to be excused from registering to participate 
in EDMS and receive an exemption from proceeding electronically. 

Fees:  Money you must pay to the clerk of court when you file your Application and at other times. 
Note: The fees listed below are set by the state legislature, which sometimes changes the fees. 

1. Court fees are paid to the clerk of court in the county where the case is filed.

a. Filing fee—to start a child support modification case ($110).  (Iowa Code section 602.8105(1)(c))

b. Court reporting fee—for each hearing in court ($40). (Iowa Code section 625.8(2))

Note on payment of court fees: At the end of your case, the court can determine, or the parties can 
agree, who will pay the fees. This would include the filing fee, court fees, service fees, and costs of 
things such as a subpoena or a deposition.

2.

Service fees:  Money you must pay to a process server, such as the county sheriff, to serve the other 
party with an Original Notice. The amount varies by county. 

File:  This word has two meanings: 

1.

“To file” a document is the act of giving the document to the clerk of court.

  In electronic cases, this means filing a document through EDMS. The system will stamp the date and
time the document is submitted to the system and when the system generated a Notice of Electronic 
Filing (also known as NEF). 

 In paper, or nonelectronic cases, filing a document means handing the paper document to the clerk 

of court. The clerk will stamp on the document the date and time that the clerk received the 
document for filing. 

2.

“File” (or “court file”) also means the folder(s) in which the clerk of court places the documents for a court
case.

Filer:  Any person or party who files a document with the court. 

Financial Affidavit (form 324):  This form provides information to the court about the parties’ income and 
expenses.  Each party must complete a Financial Affidavit. 

Gross Monthly Income:  This is the total of your income before subtracting for anything else, such as taxes, 
retirement account contributions, health insurance, etc.

Guardian Ad Litem:  A person, usually an attorney, appointed to look out for the interests of someone in a 
lawsuit.  For example, a guardian ad litem might be appointed for a child or someone who is in prison. 

Iowa Child Support Guidelines:  The uniform Iowa Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines) are used for 
calculating and determining amounts of child support.  The purpose of the Guidelines is to provide for the best 
interests of the children while recognizing the duty of both parents to provide adequate support for their children 
in proportion to their respective incomes. 

Joint Custody or Joint Legal Custody:  This means both parents have equal legal rights and responsibilities 
toward the children.  This includes such things as medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and religious 
instruction. 

Joint Physical Care:  This means both parents have equal rights and responsibilities toward the children 
including shared parenting time with the children, maintaining homes for the children and, providing routine care 
for the children. 

Legal Custody or Custody:  This means a parent has rights and responsibilities toward the children.  These 
rights include making decisions about medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and religious instruction. 

Legal Parent:  A person who is recognized by law as a parent to the child. 

Local Rules:  Some Iowa judicial districts have local rules that must be considered while processing your case.  
You can find these local rules, if any, on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/District_Courts/. 

When you get to this page, click on the judicial district for the county where your case is filed. For example: 
Johnson County is in “District 6,” and so you would click on “District Six” on the left side of the page. Then click 
on the “Local Rules” link underneath (if there is one). 

Minor Child:  A child under the legal age of 18 years. 

Motion in a Child Support Modification (form 322):  A Motion is a filing in which one of the parties asks the 
court to order something to be done while a case is going on.  For example, a party might ask to schedule a 
hearing. 

Motion and Affidavit to Serve by Publication:  Form 307 is a paper that asks the court to let the party publish 
a notice in the newspaper that a case has been filed. The person tells the court what they did to try to find the 
other person to serve the papers. 

Net Monthly Income:  This is the amount of income that you have available to spend after the deductions from 
your gross monthly income.  Your net monthly income might be the net amount of your paycheck. 

Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF):  This is the notice generated by EDMS when you, the other party, or the 
court files a document in your case.  EDMS serves (see the definition for “Serve (Service)” below) most case 
filings by means of the NEF.  The NEF indicates who on the case was electronically served and who will need to 
be served by mail because of an exemption from electronic filing.  Keep a copy of the NEF for your records. The 
NEF alerts you to log in to EDMS and look at the filings on your case, either in the Notification or the My Cases 
page for documents filed by other case parties and the court, or through the My Filings page for documents you 
filed.  If you are Applicant, you find the Original Notice and Application that you must serve on the other party in 
your My Filings page of EDMS. 

Notice of Intent to File a Written Application for Default Decree:  Applicant uses form 326 if the other party is 
“in default,” which means he or she has not filed an Answer to the Application, and Applicant wants to ask the 
court to sign a final Decree modifying child support. 

Order:  A paper signed by the judge telling a party or both parties to do something. 

Original Notice for Personal Service (forms 304 and 304a):  An Original Notice is prepared and filed by 
Applicant and signed by the clerk of court. Applicant serves the Notice on the other party along with the

Application.  This tells the other party that Applicant has filed an Application to Modify Child Support. 

Other Party:  In a child support modification case, the “other party” is the person who receives the Application to 
Modify Child Support from Applicant.  The other party can be either Petitioner or Respondent from the initial 
family law proceeding. 

Paper Filers:  Persons who have applied to the court and been granted an exemption from filing electronically, 
or persons whose case is set in a county that does not yet have electronic filing. 

Party:  This refers to a person or business in a court case. In a case to modify child support, the two parents, and 
possibly CSRU, are “parties” in the lawsuit. 

Petitioner:  The person who files a Petition to start a family law or other civil law case in court.  In an Application 
to Modify Child Support, Petitioner can be Applicant and start the modification, or Petitioner can be the other 
party who receives the Application. 

Physical Care:  This means providing a home for the minor child.  This includes taking care of the child. 

Pro se (Pronounced “proh-say.”):  This is a Latin term, which means “for or on behalf of oneself.”  It is sometimes 
used to describe a person (a pro se party) who handles his or her own court case with little or no help from an 
attorney.  A pro se party is also called a self-represented party or self-represented litigant. 

 

If you do not have an attorney, when you register to electronically file, you will pick “Registered Filer” as 
your category and be a “Pro se” filer. 

Process Server:  This is a person, other than you, who personally delivers, or serves, a paper to the other party.  
Often this process server is the county sheriff, but it may be another person who delivers legal papers. (See 
“Service (Service)” below.) 

Protected Information:  Documents filed in a child support modification will be available to members of the 
public upon request.  Protected information is personal information that should not be available to the public 
unless it is required by law or is material to the case.  Documents filed in a modification of child support action 
may be available to members of the public upon request. 

The following information is considered protected information: 

  Social Security numbers 
  Financial account numbers 
  Full dates of birth 
  Names of minor children 
 
  Personal identification numbers 

Other unique identifying numbers 

Individual taxpayer identification numbers 

Protected Information Disclosure (form 311):  On this form filers will provide the complete version of protected 
information.  It is not a public record. 

Redact (or Redaction):  “Redacting” information means removing a portion of the information so that it cannot 
be traced to a particular individual.  When you include personal information in a document you are filing, include 
only a portion of the protected or confidential information.  For example: a child’s name will be redacted to include 
only initials; a birth date will be redacted to include only the year of birth; a financial account number will be 
redacted to include only the last four digits. 

  While it is not required, the following information may be treated as protected or confidential, and thus 

redacted, without a judge’s order: 

  Driver’s license number 
 
  Employment history 

Information concerning medical treatments or diagnosis

  Personal financial information 
  Proprietary or trade secret information 
 
 
  Sensitive security information 
  Home addresses 

Information concerning a person’s cooperation with the government 
Information concerning crime victims 

Registration:  If your case is electronic, you must register for an account to file electronically through EDMS.  
For help, visit the Iowa Judicial Branch website and see “How to Register Pro Se (Self Represented) for eFiling” 
at http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Training_Documents/. 

Request for Relief: In form 327 you ask the court to do something for you.  For example, in form 327 you tell the 
court how you want the child support terms changed. The court considers this in drafting its Decree. 

Respondent:  The person who receives a Petition starting a family law or other civil law case in court.  In an 
Application to Modify Child Support case, Respondent can be Applicant and start the modification, or 
Respondent can be the other party who receives the Application. 

Return of Service:  On this form, the county sheriff or civil process server tells the court that the other party has 
received a copy of the Application and the Original Notice, or some other paper. 

Self-represented party:  This refers to a person who handles his or her own court case with little or no help from 
an attorney.  A self-represented party is sometimes called a pro se (pronounced “proh-say”) party.  “Pro se” is a 
Latin term, which means “for or on behalf of oneself.” 

  As a self-represented party, when you register to file electronically, you will pick “Registered Filer” as 

your category and be a “Pro se” filer. 

Serve (Service):  To give the other party (and CSRU if involved in your case) a copy of a form or document, like 
the Application and Original Notice.  Some papers must be given in-person and some papers can be sent by mail 
or served electronically. 

  After the Application and Original Notice are personally served by the Applicant, EDMS serves most 

papers by means of the Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF). Exceptions to electronic service are made for 
people who apply for and are granted an exemption by the court. See Rule 16.317 for rules on service of 
documents subsequent to the original notice. 

  Electronic Service:  This is where an electronically filed document or form is served by EDMS on all 
registered case parties who have filed an Answer (if a self-represented party) or an Appearance (if an 
attorney). 

  Mailed Service:  This is where a paper (legal document) is delivered through the mail to a party in a 

court case to that party’s last known address. 

  Personal Service:  This is where a paper (legal document) is delivered to a party in a court case by a 
party, another person, a sheriff, or some other civil process server. See forms 305 (Acceptance of 
Service), 306 (Directions for Service), and 310 (Affidavit of Service). 

Settlement Agreement:  A paper (form 328) with the final agreement between the parties on how to change 
child support.  It is filed with the clerk of court and then given to the judge.  The Settlement Agreement (form 328) 
will include details for the Decree modifying of child support, if the judge agrees those terms are fair to both sides 
and in the best interests of the children. 

Subpoena (Pronounced “suh-pee-nuh.”):  A paper ordering a person to appear in court and give testimony.  The 
court may impose a penalty on a person who fails to obey a subpoena without a good reason.

  The clerk of court can tell you whether your county uses electronic filing (EDMS).  This information is 
also available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at:  http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Overview/ . 

 

If your county uses electronic filing, but you cannot proceed electronically, you must receive permission 
from the court to file in paper.  Contact the clerk of court in the county where the Application will be or 
has been filed for more information on being excused from electronic filing. 

  If the county where your case is does not yet accept electronic filing, you must proceed in paper.  For 
documents or forms you want to file with the court, take originals and copies to the clerk of court 
office in your county. 

B.  Filing fees 

  The clerk of court in your county can tell you what the filing fee will be in your case.  The Iowa legislature 

sets these fees and periodically raises them, so check with the clerk’s office to confirm the current filing 
fee. 

  Each county in Iowa has a clerk of court office for the district court of that county. 

  The Iowa Judicial Branch website provides a directory of clerk of court offices in Iowa:

VII. Clerk of Court Offices in Iowa 

   

C.  Scheduling questions 

  Contact the clerk of court for scheduling questions. 

  If Applicant and the other party do not agree on how to settle the modification, ask the clerk of court 

how to schedule the case for trial.  Follow the instructions of the clerk of court. 

  You must have a very good reason to reschedule any court hearing. 
  To reschedule a hearing at the last minute, there must be an emergency. 

You should immediately call the clerk of court office where your hearing is scheduled. 

  Calmly explain your problem, and ask to reschedule the hearing or trial.  Court staff will write 
down the request and contact the judge.  The judge will decide whether your reason for 
changing the hearing or trial date is serious enough to grant your request. 
  Give the clerk your phone number where you can be contacted that day. 

  If something very important comes up two or more days before the hearing, like a death in the family 
or an accident that puts you in the hospital, you must submit your request for a new hearing date or 
time in writing and file it with the clerk of court.  In a divorce case with dependent children, use the 
family law Motion (form 322) to ask the court for a new hearing date. 

  Do this as soon as you know you need to reschedule the hearing. 

D.  Important:  Clerks of court and court staff cannot give you legal advice.

IX.  Tips on Handling Your Own Case in Iowa’s Courts 

A.  Judges and court staff cannot give you legal advice. 

  They cannot tell you whether you should file a case, what you should put in your papers, or what you 

should say or ask in court.  Why? Because: 

  Judges and court staff must not take sides or appear to take sides in any case.  It would be unfair for 

judges or court staff to give one person an advantage over another person in a court case. 
If court staff gives you advice and it turns out to be wrong, you could lose your case. 

 

B.  Court staff cannot: 

  Tell you what you should do about anything involving your court case.  They cannot tell you: 

xception:  If a person has a physical disability or cannot read or write, and the person explains the 
disability to a clerk, then the clerk may fill in the form.  The clerk, however, must write down only the 
exact words provided by the person who requested help. 

  E

  Court staff cannot tell you the meaning of laws or court decisions. 

  Court staff cannot perform legal research for a person involved in a court case. 

  Court staff cannot predict the outcome of a case, a paper filed, or some other action in a case. 

C.  Court staff can: 

  Provide public information contained in:  dockets, calendars, case files, indexes, and reports. 

  Show or tell where to find laws or rules. 

 

Identify approved court forms that might meet the needs of a person who does not have an attorney. 

  Answer questions about where to write in particular types of information on court forms, but not what 

words to use when filling in the forms. 

  Define terms commonly used in court. 

  Provide phone numbers for lawyer referral services. 

 

D.  You cannot talk to the judge unless all parties and attorneys are present. 

  You cannot communicate with the judge about your case by email or regular mail, unless you also send 

copies of your email or regular mail to the other people involved in your case at the same time. 

  You cannot talk with the judge about your case by telephone or in-person unless all other parties are on 

the phone at the same time or in the same room with you. 

  This rule is important because it prevents a person or an attorney from giving information to a judge that 

the other side does not know about.  This would be unfair to the other side. 

 

If you want to give the judge information you think is important for your case, or you want the judge to 
take some action related to a case, 

March 2014

  Whether you should file a specific form. 
  What words or phrases you should use in a form. 
  What persons you should file a lawsuit against. 
  How much money to ask for from the other party. 
  What questions to ask witnesses or other parties. 
  Whether to appeal a judge’s decision. 
  How to fill in a form for a person involved in a case. 

 

 
  If your case is electronic, you must electronically file the document as a Motion or Application 

(whichever is correct), so that EDMS can notify all parties of your request. 

  If your case is in paper, you must put the request in writing. (See approved Iowa court forms for 

examples of how to do this.) 

  Make enough copies for you and all the other parties. 
  Take the papers to the clerk of court office. The clerk will stamp each copy and keep one. 
  Deliver a copy to each of the other parties or their attorneys. Keep a copy for yourself. 

E.  Be prepared 

 

 

 

 

  Keep copies of all the papers you file in court and the papers you get from the other party. 

  Know what evidence you need to prove your case. If possible, ask an attorney what you need to do 

before you go to court and what to do at the court hearing. 

  Bring papers and witnesses that will help you present your side of the case. 

  Bring at least three copies of each document you want to use as evidence—one for you, one for the 

other party, and one for the judge. 

If you are filing electronically, any document you plan to use as an exhibit at a hearing or trial can be 
submitted electronically using the Exhibit Submission event. 

  Remember to redact protected information from your exhibit submissions, because they are public 

documents. 

If a witness refuses to come to court to testify, you can ask the court to issue a subpoena (pronounced 
“suh-pee-nuh”). A subpoena is an order requiring a person to come to court.  Be sure to ask the clerk's 
office for a subpoena several days before your court hearing. 

  Bring physical evidence, if there is any.  This might include a canceled check, contract, or invoice.  If your 

case involves damaged property, bring the damaged item or a photograph of it. 

F.  Be on time 

If you are not in court when your case is called (scheduled), and the other party is present, the judge 
might enter a judgment against you. 

If neither party is on time, your case might be skipped. You might have to wait until the very end of the 
court session that day before your case is called again.  Or you might have to come back on another 
day—possibly a few weeks later. 

G.  Know and follow court rules 

  Judges cannot make exceptions for people without attorneys.  You could lose your case if you do not 

follow the correct procedures. 

  When you electronically file a paper through EDMS, the system will serve that paper to the other 

party or (parties) or the other party’s attorney. 

  The Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) will tell you who was served and whether you must send paper 

copies to anyone who is exempt from electronic filing. 

  When you file a document in paper at the clerk of court office, you must mail or deliver a copy of that 

paper to the other party (or parties) or the other party’s attorney. Always keep a copy for your 
records. 

H.  Be courteous and respectful 

  Make a good impression on the judge.  A judge can hold a person "in contempt of court" for bad 

behavior.  This could result in a fine or time in jail. 

March 2014

  Wait for your turn to speak.  Do not interrupt the judge or the other party. If you interrupt others in court, 

the judge will stop you and instruct you to wait your turn. 

  Turn off your cell phone and other electronic devices when in court. 

I.  Dress appropriately 

 

In court you should wear business attire such as a suit, sport coat, dress, or dress slacks, if you can. 
Otherwise, wear nice, clean casual clothes and shoes.  Remove your hat or cap while you are in the 
courtroom or in the judge’s office. 

J.  Speak loudly and clearly so everyone in the courtroom can hear you. 

  Judges and the other parties in court need to hear the facts correctly.  The judge needs to hear you 

clearly so that he or she can make a correct decision. 

K.  If you cannot attend a court hearing or cannot be on time, you must inform the court. 

  You must have a very good reason to reschedule any court hearing. 

  To reschedule a hearing at the last minute, there must be an emergency. 

You should immediately call the clerk of court office where your hearing is scheduled. 

  Calmly explain your problem, and ask to reschedule the hearing or trial.  Court staff will write down 
the request and contact the judge.  The judge will decide whether your reason for changing the 
hearing or trial date is serious enough to grant your request. 

  Give the clerk your phone number where you can be contacted that day. 

 

If something very important comes up two or more days before the hearing, like a death in the family or 
an accident that puts you in the hospital, you must submit your request for a new hearing date or time in 
writing and file it with the clerk of court.  In a divorce case with dependent children, use the family law 
Motion (form 322) to ask the court for a new hearing date. 

  Do this as soon as you know you need to reschedule the hearing. 

 

It's more likely a judge will agree to your request if you get the other party to sign a written agreement 
to change the hearing time or date, and include it with your Motion for a new hearing date.

  Because judges are busy, you probably will not get an answer right away.

the judge may enter a judgment in favor of the other party.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
