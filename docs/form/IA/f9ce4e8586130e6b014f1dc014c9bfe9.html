      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>In this Guide, three symbols are used to indicate whether information is specific to electronic filing, 
specific to paper filing, or applies to all cases whether electronic or in paper: 

 Important: Read all information marked with this arrow, whether you file 

electronically or in paper. 

 

 

 

If you represent yourself (without an attorney) in a divorce case, and you have minor or dependent 
adult children, you must use the court-approved forms identified in this Guide and contained in 
Chapter 17 of the Iowa Court Rules.  These forms are available free of charge in fillable and 
savable format on the Iowa Judicial Branch website:  www.iowacourts.gov.  
 
If you do not understand how to use these forms, or do not know if you should use these 
forms, talk to an attorney. 

  These forms must be used whether the filings in your case will be electronic or in paper.  If you are 
unsure whether your county, or the county where your case is filed, accepts electronic filing, check 
the map available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Overview/ or call the clerk of court office in your county.  You can 
find a directory at http://www.iowacourts.gov/Administration/Directories/ . 
 
If the county where this case is filed accepts electronic filing, you must file electronically unless you 
get permission from the court to file in paper.  Contact the clerk of court if you are unable to file 
electronically. 
 
If you do not have minor or dependent children, you should not use the forms identified in this 
Guide.  The forms also are not recommended for people who own a business, a lot of investments, 
or a lot of real estate. 

 

 

  Read this Guide carefully.  This Guide will help you through each step, but many issues in a 

divorce are complicated, and you may need to talk to an attorney. 
 

  Submission of these forms does not guarantee your dissolution will be granted without a trial or 

further questions from the judge.  
 

  Even if you both agree to get divorced, agree on terms of custody and visitation of your children, 
and agree how to divide your property, you must have a judge approve the terms of your 
divorce and go through many steps in the court process to get divorced. 

If you are still uncertain what to do after reading this Guide, you should talk with an attorney.  An 
attorney can help you with all or just some of the steps in a divorce case.  

  Before you file a divorce with children on your own, you may want to consult an attorney about 
custody, child support, and visitation in your current situation and how that might change in a 
divorce.

Important!  An Iowa court cannot decide custody if it does not have jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is very 
complicated. Generally, the court will have jurisdiction if the children have lived in Iowa for at least 
six months. But there are exceptions. If there is an order for custody or visitation of the children in 
another state, Iowa may not be able to enter a custody order. If the children have not lived in Iowa 
for six months, Iowa may not have jurisdiction. It is important to fill out the part of the Petition about 
where the children have lived and what custody orders are already in place. The court needs that 
information to decide jurisdiction. If Iowa does not have jurisdiction to enter an order, the order may 
not be good. 
 

  You are not divorced until a judge signs a final “Decree of Dissolution of Marriage.” 

  The term “dissolution of marriage” means the same thing as “divorce.”  “Petitioner” is the spouse 
who files the Petition to start a divorce case.  The other spouse is “Respondent.”  You keep these 
titles for the rest of your divorce case.   Petitioner and Respondent are also called the “parties” in 
the case.  Part IX of this Guide defines many other legal terms you should know. 

  On pages 5 and 6 of this Guide is a list of approved court forms available from the Iowa Judicial 

Branch website at: http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/eFiling_Forms/  or at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/For_the_Public/Representing_Yourself_in_Court/DivorceFamily_Law/Fo
rms/.  The forms are also in Chapter 17 of the Iowa Court Rules. 

  Carefully read the specific instructions on each form.  You should read part X of this Guide: Iowa 

Court Expectations of Parents in a Dissolution of Marriage Involving Children.  You should also 
read part XI of this Guide: Tips on Handling Your Own Case in Iowa’s Courts.  

  You must determine issues of child custody, child support, and visitation during the court case 

process.  These things can be very difficult to change after a judge signs your final divorce Decree.  
Also, if you want spousal support (alimony), a share of your spouse’s pension, or other property, 
you must ask for it during the court case process.  You cannot get it after a judge signs your final 
divorce Decree. 

It is illegal to sign another person’s signature on any court form or other legal paper. 

Important: Clerks of court and court staff cannot give you legal advice.   
 

  The divorce laws in Iowa are in chapter 598 of the Iowa Code.  You can find the Iowa Code in 

public libraries, or on the Iowa legislature’s website: 
www.legis.iowa.gov/IowaLaw/statutoryLaw.aspx. 

  Electronic Filing (EDMS) 

If your case will be or is filed in a county that uses electronic filing, you are required to register and 
electronically file your documents using the Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). In 
exceptional circumstances, you may apply to the court for an exemption (to be excused), from 
electronic filing requirements.  
 

  Because your divorce case will become a public case when the judge signs the final Decree of 

Dissolution of Marriage, it is critical that you understand and know your responsibility for these two 
things: 
 

  What information is protected (or may or should be kept private); and  

 

  How to redact (or remove) protected information from the papers (or legal documents) 

that you file in your case.

 

See Chapter 16 Rules Pertaining to the Use of the Electronic Document Management System at:    
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Overview/.  Refer to Division VI of Chapter 16 for rules on 
protecting private information. 
 

  You must still personally serve your spouse with a copy of your Petition and Original Notice, even 
if you are filing electronically.  After the Petition and Original Notice documents are personally 
served, whenever you electronically file an additional document in your case, EDMS will serve a 
copy of that document on your registered spouse or your spouse’s attorney if there is one.   

The Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) will indicate if your spouse is excused from electronic filing 
requirements, in which case, you must mail a copy or serve in paper a copy of the document on 
your spouse if he or she does not have an attorney. 
 

  Even if you are filing electronically, most dissolution forms require you to certify the information 

you are providing by handwriting your signature on the form.  These forms must then be scanned 
in and electronically filed. 
 
To view the dissolution forms, you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed.  Go to: 
http://get.adobe.com/reader/. 

 

 
  Paper Filing 

If the county in which your case is filed uses electronic filing, you must receive permission from 
the court before you can file in paper. 

Some instructions, and some forms, are different if you are filing in paper rather than 
electronically. 

  Whenever you file a paper at the clerk of court office, you must deliver a copy of that paper to 

your spouse or your spouse’s attorney. You should also keep a copy for yourself.  The only 
exception is the Confidential Information Form (203): Do not give a copy of that form to your 
spouse. 

Because your divorce case will become a public case when the judge signs the final Decree of 
Dissolution of Marriage, it is critical that you understand and know your responsibility for these 
two things: 

  What information is protected (or may or should be kept private); and  

  How to redact (or remove) protected information from the papers (or legal documents) 

that you file in your case.  

Be sure to print clearly when filling in paper forms.

B.  Filing your case.  
  Filing your case electronically. 

If you are filing your divorce case in a county that uses electronic filing, you must register to 
electronically file.  For help with registration, see the eFile User Guide “How to Register Pro Se 
(Self Represented) for eFiling.” 

  After you have registered, log in to the electronic filing system at 

https://www.iowacourts.state.ia.us/EFile/ to electronically file your dissolution case. 

For help electronically filing your divorce, see “How to File a New Case” at 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Training_Documents/. 

If you are unable to proceed electronically, you must receive permission from the court to file in 
paper.  Contact the clerk of court in the county where the petition will be filed for more information 
on being excused from electronic filing.

  With your Petition (201), you must also file an Original Notice (form 204) and a Protected 

Information Disclosure (form 211) with the full version of any protected information or other 
information you have redacted or omitted from the Petition. 

If filing electronically, you will receive a Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) when the clerk of court 
has approved the filing of your Petition. 

Log in to your eFile account and download and print your Petition, Original Notice, and Protected 
Information Disclosure so that you can serve (deliver them to) your spouse.   

For help finding and downloading your Petition, Original Notice, and Protected Information 
Disclosure, please see the “My Filings Reference Guide” at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Training_Documents/. 

 

  Filing your case in paper. 

If the county where you will be filing your Petition does not yet accept electronic filing, you must 
proceed in paper.  If the county does accept electronic filing, you must proceed electronically, 
unless you have received permission from the court to file in paper. 

  With your Petition, you must also file a Petition Cover Sheet (form 202), an Original Notice (form 

204a), and a Confidential Information Form (form 203).  It is also recommended that you file a 
Protected Information Disclosure (form 211) with the complete version of any protected 
information or other information that you have redacted or omitted from the Petition. 

Forms 201 and 204a and, if applicable, 211: Make two copies if you can deliver copies of these 
forms to your spouse in-person or by mail. Make three copies if you are going to ask the county 
sheriff or a civil process server to deliver these forms to your spouse.  

Forms 202 and 203: You do not have to make photocopies of these forms. 

Note about making photocopies:  You should make your photocopies before you go to the 
courthouse to file your papers.  It is expensive to make photocopies at the clerk of court office. It 
is cheaper to make the copies at a business that makes photocopies or at a public library. 

Take the original forms you filled in and the photocopies to the clerk of court office in your county.  
Tell the clerk at the counter you are filing a Petition for a divorce. 

 

Give the clerk at the counter the original forms and the photocopies of these forms: 

  201    Petition for Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce) with Children 
  202    Coversheet for a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage With Children 
  203    Confidential Information Form (Do not make copies of this form.) 
  204a  Original Notice  
  211   Protected Information Disclosure, if applicable 

Pay the filing fee, or file form 209.  (See above.)  The clerk at the counter can tell you the amount 
of the filing fee. See the term “Fees” in part IX of this Guide for a list of the fees you might have to 
pay during the divorce process. The Iowa legislature sets these fees and periodically raises them, 
so check with the clerk’s office to confirm the current filing fee.  

The clerk of court will sign the Original Notice (form 204a).  You will have to serve this form on 
(deliver it to) your spouse.  (See section C, below.) 

The clerk at the counter will time-stamp each of the copies (original and photocopies). 

C. Serve (deliver) the Original Notice (form 204 if filing electronically; form 204a if filing in paper), a 

copy of the Petition (form 201), and, if applicable, the Protected Information Disclosure (form 211) 
on your spouse. (See the definition of “Serve (Service)” on page 28.)

(Petitioner’s spouse).  If Petitioner fails to meet this deadline the dissolution of marriage case will 
be dismissed. 

If you know where your spouse is, you have three options for completing service: 

   Service Option 1:  You can hand the forms to your spouse yourself, or send the forms to 
your spouse by regular mail.  You must also get your spouse to sign an “Acceptance of 
Service” (form 205; see below).  After your spouse signs the Acceptance of Service form, you

personally delivers the Original Notice and a copy of the Petition to Respondent and 
Respondent is willing to sign the “Acceptance of Service” form. 

  Service Option 2:  You can ask the county sheriff or other civil process server to serve the 
forms on your spouse.  Note: If you filed an Application & Affidavit to Defer Costs (form 209) 
and the court approved it, you must have the county sheriff serve the forms. 

If you choose option 2, you must fill in two forms: 204 (if filing electronically) or 204a (if filing in 
paper), and 206 (see below). 

  206 

Directions for Service of Original Notice. Use this if you know where your spouse lives 
or works, but you want the county sheriff or other civil process server to deliver the divorce 
Petition (form 201) and Original Notice (form 204 or form 204a if filing in paper) to your 
spouse. 

  Give the county sheriff or other process server two copies of the: 

 

  Original Notice (form 204 or 204a) 
  Petition (form 201) 
  Directions for Service (form 206) 
  Protected Information Disclosure (form 211), if applicable.  

 

  Tell the sheriff or process server to deliver the Original Notice, Petition, and Protected 

Information Disclosure to your spouse. 

  The sheriff or other process server will file the “proof of service” with the clerk of court 
after you pay the service fee. If the court granted your Application to Defer Costs (form 
209), the county sheriff must be the one who delivers the forms to your spouse. 

  Service Option 3:  You can have another person who is not a sheriff or process server deliver 
the papers to your spouse.  If a person other than you, a sheriff, or a process server delivers a

If you do not know where your spouse is, you can ask the court for permission to give notice 
to your spouse by publication in a newspaper. 

  A court will give a Petitioner permission to give notice by publication in a newspaper only if 
Petitioner has tried several ways to find his or her spouse.  Some steps you can take to find 
your spouse include: 

  Contacting your spouse’s parents, brothers, sisters, friends, former employer, or 

people she or he used to work with. 

  Checking local or area phone books, or phone books where you think your spouse 

might be living. 

  Searching for your spouse using internet-based search engines or social media.  If 
you do not know how to do this, go to your local library and ask a librarian for help. 

  Contacting an attorney to help you. 
  If you cannot find your spouse, you should mail a copy of the Original Notice (form 

204), the Petition (form 201), and, if applicable, the Protected Information Disclosure 
(form 211) to your spouse’s last known address.  You must do this to get a divorce 
Decree by default. (See part VI.A and form 225 below.)   

  If you cannot find your spouse after taking these steps, you can ask the court for 

permission to serve notice by publication in a newspaper.  To do this, you must file form

for in the Petition.   

  You (Respondent) might also receive other papers (court “orders”) filed in your case that tell you 

things you must do as part of the divorce process. Examples of these orders are: 
 Setting the date for the pretrial conference,  
 Requiring each spouse to give financial or other information to the other spouse, or  
 Requiring attendance at mediation (in some counties). 

  Even if your spouse is not represented by an attorney, you may still talk to or hire an attorney to 

help you with the divorce process.

IV. Children in the Middle Course 

 

 

  Iowa law requires that parents with children must attend a course on the effects of divorce on 

children before the court will enter a final Decree. 

  Within forty-five days of the service of original notice, each parent must take the Children in the 

Middle class. 

  You can find information on this class and the location in your area under Representing Yourself in 

the Divorce/Family Law section of the judicial branch website:

  You can also ask the clerk of court about the class. 

V.   What You Should do During the 90-Day Waiting Period for Getting a Final    
Divorce Decree 

  Under Iowa law, there is a waiting period of 90 days before a judge can sign the final divorce 

Decree.  The 90 days usually begins on the latest of the following dates: 

 When the Petition and Original Notice are served on Respondent by a sheriff or civil process 

server; or  

 When you file the Acceptance of Service (form 205); or 
 If Petitioner serves notice by publication in a newspaper, the 90-day waiting period begins 20 

days after the final (third) date of publication in the newspaper. 

  In some situations, this 90-day waiting period may be shortened if you file a Motion (form 222) and 
explain to the court why you think the waiting period should be shortened in your case.  Judges will 
require a very good reason for shortening the waiting period. 

  Here is a list of forms that either Petitioner or Respondent can use during the 90-day waiting period 

to complete the steps necessary to get a final divorce Decree.

this.  Usually the Petitioner uses this if the Respondent has not filed an Answer to the 
Petition and the Petitioner wants to move forward and ask the court to sign a final divorce 
Decree. 

Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Children.  Use this if both 
parties agree how to divide property, assets, and debts. 

Agreed Parenting Plan.  Parents who can agree on what they want for child custody and 
visitation use this to tell the court where they want the children to live and where the children 
will spend holidays. The parties (Petitioner and Respondent) fill out one of these and both 
parents sign it. 

Proposed Parenting Plan.  Parents who do not have an Agreed Parenting Plan use this to 
tell the court where they want the children to live and where the children will spend holidays. 
Each party (Petitioner and Respondent) must fill out one of these. 

B.  Things one or both spouses can do during the 90-day waiting period to complete the steps 

necessary to get a final divorce Decree upon expiration of the 90-day waiting period.  Financial 
Affidavits and Parenting Plans are required to be completed before a divorce will be finalized. 

  You may file a Motion requesting the court to do something.  

You or your spouse might need something that requires a temporary order from the court.  For 
example, one of the spouses might request temporary financial support, temporary custody or 
visitation, or to pay attorney fees before the court enters a divorce Decree.  If so, file a Motion (form 
222) with the court to ask for what you want. 

  If your spouse files a Motion, and you disagree with what your spouse is asking the court to 
do, you should fill out and file a Response to the Motion (form 223). This form allows you to 
tell the court that you disagree with your spouse’s Motion. 

  If your case is electronic, EDMS will send you a notice telling you the date, time, and 

  If your case is in paper, the clerk’s office will mail you a notice telling you the date, time, 

location of the hearing.   

and location of the hearing. 

  You must go to the hearing. If you do not show up for the hearing, the court will not give 

you the things you request in your Motion. 

  Complete and file a Financial Affidavit (form 224). 

During the waiting period, each spouse can fill out, sign, and file a Financial Affidavit.  Each party 
must complete a Financial Affidavit during the divorce process. 

  Financial Affidavits give the court information about the parties’ property, amount of debts, 

and income levels.  

  The court will use this information to set or change child support. 
  You will not get a final divorce Decree until you complete the Financial Affidavit. 

  Complete and file a Settlement Agreement (form 228). 

If you and your spouse agree how to divide your property, assets, and debts, you should complete 
and file a Settlement Agreement (form 228). 

 Work together to fill out the Settlement Agreement. 
 Sign and print the Agreement and proceed with the steps for filing electronically or in paper.

  You must fill out a Parenting Plan during the divorce process.  This gives the court information 
about your wishes for custody and visitation. You will not get a final decree until you complete a 
Parenting Plan. 
  

 If both parents agree on custody and visitation, use form 229, Agreed Parenting Plan.   

  You must choose which parent has legal custody. This means making decisions about 

things such as medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and religious 
instruction.  

  You must choose which parent has physical care or whether the parents will share 

physical care. This means providing a home for and taking care of the child. 

  You and your spouse must agree on custody and visitation. 
  Work together to fill it out and sign the form. 

  

 If you and your spouse do not agree on custody and visitation, you must each fill out and sign 

separate Proposed Parenting Plans, form 230. 

  On form 230, the parent chooses who that parent wants to have legal custody. This 

means making decisions about things such as medical care, education, extracurricular 
activities, and religious instruction.  

  The parent chooses which parent has physical care or whether the parents should share 

physical care. This means providing a home for and taking care of the child. 

 

 

 

 

  You might have to attend educational or mediation programs. The court may require you to 
attend an educational program about divorce or require you to attend a mediation session with 
your spouse. These requirements vary by judicial district, and you should carefully read all 
information you receive from the court or the clerk of court. 

If you will be changing the title to any real estate as part of your divorce, you should contact an 
attorney to get advice on how to do this.

B.    Divorce Decree by Written Agreements  
 

  If you and your spouse agree on how to divide your property and debts, and agree on terms of 

custody, visitation, and child support, you can work together to prepare a Settlement Agreement 
(form 228) and an Agreed Parenting Plan (form 229).  Note: Even with a Settlement Agreement 
and Agreed Parenting Plan, the court will review the terms or your Agreements and must approve 
the terms of your divorce before granting a final divorce Decree.  After you complete and file the 
forms, you should:   

  File a Motion for a hearing date on your Agreements.  
  Ask the clerk of court when a judge can meet with you about your Settlement Agreement and 
Agreed Parenting Plan.  Because most courts have very busy schedules, it might be one 
week (or more) before you can meet with a judge. The clerk will tell you or mail you a notice 
with the date and time when you can meet with the judge. 

  Note about the 90-day waiting period:  You might complete the steps for getting a divorce 

Decree by written Settlement Agreement and Agreed Parenting Plan before the 90-day waiting 
period is up.  If you want to shorten the 90-day waiting period, you must ask the court to do so.

VII.  One Thing You Must do After a Judge Signs the Divorce Decree 

  After a judge has signed your final divorce Decree, one party to the divorce—usually the Petitioner 

does this—must complete a “Report of Dissolution of Marriage or Annulment Form.”   

  One party, whether the case is electronic or in paper, must visit the clerk of court office in the 

county in which the dissolution of marriage is finalized and ask the clerk at the counter for this form. 

  Fill in the form, but leave items 18 through 22 blank for the clerk of court to complete.   
  Give the form back to the clerk of court at the counter. 

 

 

VIII.  Things You Might have to do After a Judge Signs the Divorce Decree 

  Some important things might not automatically happen after the judge signs the final divorce 

Decree.  You must take steps to make some things happen.  For example: 

 You may want to close any credit cards and joint bank accounts that are in the names of both 
spouses.  Creditors often try to collect debts from anyone whose name was on the account, 
even if the divorce Decree orders one person to pay the debt.   

 If the divorce Decree gives you or your spouse part of the other person’s retirement account or 
pension, a separate order must be entered.  It is called a Qualified Domestic Relations Order 
(QDRO) and can be complicated.  Ask an attorney for help with a QDRO, so it is done correctly. 

 If you will be changing the title to real estate, you should talk to an attorney. This is a 
complicated and very important step in the divorce process. You want to be sure to do this 
correctly.

IX. Terms Used in the Divorce with Children Process 

cceptance of Service of Original Notice (form 205):  On this form Respondent can sign to acknowledge, 
or admit, receiving a copy of the divorce Petition and Original Notice from Petitioner.  Signing this paper does 
not mean Respondent agrees to the divorce or anything else that is in the Petition.  (Note: the county sheriff 
or other civil process server does not need to serve the divorce Petition and Original Notice if the Respondent 
signs this Acceptance of Service.)   

ffidavit of Mailing Notice (form 225):  This form tells the court that the person mailed a notice to the other 

party.  Petitioner must use this form if he or she served Notice by Publication in a newspaper.  Petitioner or 
Respondent must use this form if he or she asks the court for a final Decree by default. 

ffidavit of Service of Original Notice and Petition for Dissolution of Marriage (form 210): Use this form 

if another person who is not a sheriff or process server delivered the Petition and Original Notice to 
Respondent.  

ffidavit for Temporary Custody and Visitation (form 221):  On this form a parent or someone else can tell 

the court about custody and visitation before the case is finished. 

limony:  This is the same as “spousal support” defined below.   

nswer (form 215 or 216): Respondent uses the Answer to respond to what Petitioner—Respondent’s 

spouse—asks for in the Petition. 

pplication and Affidavit to Defer Payment of Costs (form 209): This form asks the court for an order to 
allow Petitioner to file the Petition without paying the filing fee or the costs of service at that time. You might be 
required to pay the fee or costs later. 

hapter 16 Rules Pertaining to the Use of the Electronic Document Management System (EDMS): 

These are the rules that govern electronic filing, available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website.  See Division 
VI of the Chapter 16 Rules about Protection of Personal Privacy.  Your divorce case will become public when 
the judge signs your final decree, so it is critical that you understand what information you must protect from 
public disclosure and how to redact it from documents you file in your case.  

over Sheet (form 202):  This form is used only in nonelectronic cases (paper filing) and it identifies the type 

of lawsuit being filed (dissolution of marriage). It must be completed and filed with the Petition (form 201). 

ommunity property: This is property that belongs to both the wife and the husband, not just to one of them. 

onfidential Information: Confidential information is personal information that should not be available to the 

public unless it is required by law or is material to the case.  Documents filed in a dissolution of marriage 
action will be available to members of the public upon request once the divorce is final when the court has 
approved a Decree.  

  The following information is considered confidential information in cases that are filed in paper:  

  Social Security numbers 
  Financial account numbers 
  Full dates of birth 
  Names of minor children 
 
  Personal identification numbers 
  Other unique identifying numbers 

Individual taxpayer identification numbers 

onfidential Information Form (203): This form is used only in nonelectronic cases (paper filing).  Iowa law 
requires all parties filing in paper to provide the clerk of court with complete personal identifying information on 
a Confidential Information Form.  The clerk of court will keep this form confidential and separate from the

ecree of Dissolution of Marriage:  The document a judge signs that ends your marriage. It will require you 
and your spouse to do certain things, including dividing your property and debts in a certain way and following 
child custody and visitation arrangements.  By getting together with your spouse and completing a Settlement 
Agreement (form 228) and Agreed Parenting Plan (form 229), you can tell the judge what you both want the 
final Decree to say.  The judge will review these agreements and determine the final terms of your divorce 
Decree.  If you and your spouse do not agree how to settle your divorce, you can tell the judge what you want 
the final Decree to say by filling out and filing a Request for Relief (form 227) and Proposed Parenting Plan 
(form 230). The judge will always make the final decision on what the divorce Decree will say.  

nce a judge enters your divorce Decree, papers filed during the dissolution action will be available to 

members of the public upon request.  

 

It is important that you understand what is meant by “protected information” (defined below) and how to 
“redact” (defined below) such information on the Protected Information Disclosure (form 211).   

efault:  A Default or Default Judgment is a ruling from the court that your spouse (or you) did not do 
something that was required during the divorce process. For example, the judge could enter a default 
judgment if Respondent did not file an Answer after receiving an Original Notice. Once the court enters a 
Default or Default Judgment, the court may then issue other orders, including an order of divorce or final 
Decree (dissolution of marriage). Forms 226 and 227 can be used to get a “Decree by default.”  

ependent Adult Child:  A child age 18 or older who still requires support from parents.  For example, a child 

who is age 18 but is still in high school, or a child age 18 or older who is in college or is disabled and still 
needs support. 

irections for Service of Original Notice (form 206):  This form gives information to the county sheriff or  

other civil process server on how and where to serve the Petition on Respondent.  See “Serve (Service)” 
below. 

iscovery:  This is the process for you and your spouse to give each other information that explains the facts 

of your marriage, including details of property, income, debts, and information about the children. You may 
have to do this by answering questions or providing papers. 

issolution of Marriage:  In Iowa, divorce is formally known as “dissolution of marriage.”  The term is legally 

synonymous with “divorce.” 

lectronic Document Management System (EDMS): This is Iowa’s Internet-based court system that allows 

you to electronically file documents and receive filings on your case from other parties and the court.  
Electronic filing is required in counties that use EDMS, and special court rules apply to cases that are 
electronically filed.  You must register to use EDMS.  See the eFiling page on the Iowa Judicial Branch 
website at https://www.iowacourts.state.ia.us/EFile/ to request an account.  See also “eFile Documents Links” 
at the bottom of that page for rules, forms, and helpful guides to eFiling processes. 

lectronic Filing (eFiling): Electronic filing is the submission of documents through Iowa’s Internet-based 
court system (EDMS).  With electronic filing, you do not take a paper to the courthouse to file it, unless you 
have applied for and have received an exemption (see definition below) from electronic filing.   

ncumbrance:  This is a general term for a charge against real estate and may include liens, mortgages, and 

other charges—such as special tax assessments—against real estate.   

quity:  This term means fairness and justice.  “Equity cases” usually include family law cases (divorce, child 

custody, and support) and real property issues, where a court must fairly divide property and responsibilities 
among the parties. 

xemption:  All cases are presumed to be electronic unless they are in a county that has not yet implemented

EDMS.  Under exceptional circumstances, a party may ask the court to be excused from registering to 
participate in EDMS and receive an exemption from proceeding electronically.   

Fair Market Value:  This is the price you are likely to get for something when you offer it for sale to the public 
in an open market. 

Fees:  Money you must pay to the clerk of court when you file your Petition and at other times.   
Note: The fees listed below are set by the state legislature, which sometimes changes the fees. 

1. Court fees are paid to the clerk of court in the county where the case is filed.

a. Filing and Final Decree fee—($265). (Iowa Code section 602.8105(1)(b))
b. Court reporting fee—for each hearing in court ($40). (Iowa Code section 625.8(2))
c. Certification of change of real estate title ($60). (Iowa Code section 602.8105(2)(c)) 

Note on payment of court fees: At the end of your divorce the court can determine, or the parties can 
agree, who will pay the fees. This would include the filing fee, court fees, service fees, and costs of 
things such as a subpoena or a deposition. 

2. Service fees:  Money you must pay to a process server, such as the county sheriff, to serve your

spouse with an Original Notice. The amount varies by county.

3. Recording fee:  If your divorce includes a change of real estate title, the County Recorder charges a

fee to enter your change of title to real estate.

File:  This word has two meanings: 

1. “To file” a document is the act of giving the document to the clerk of court.

 In electronic cases, this means filing a document through EDMS. The system will stamp the date
and time the document is submitted to the system and when the system generated a Notice of
Electronic Filing (also known as NEF).

 In paper, or nonelectronic cases, filing a document means handing the paper document to the clerk

of court. The clerk will stamp on the document the date and time that the clerk received the
document for filing.

2. “File” (or “court file”) also means the folder(s) in which the clerk of court places the documents for a
court case.

Filer:  Any person or party who files a document with the court. 

Financial Affidavit (form 224):  This form provides information to the court about you and your spouse’s 
property, debts, income, and expenses.  Each party must complete a Financial Affidavit. 

Gross Monthly Income:  This is the total of your income before subtracting for anything else, such as taxes, 
retirement account contributions, health insurance, etc. 

Guardian Ad Litem:  A person, usually an attorney, appointed to look out for the interests of someone in a 
lawsuit.  For example, a guardian ad litem might be appointed for a child or someone who is in prison.  

Joint custody or Joint legal custody:  This means both parents have equal legal rights and responsibilities 
toward the children.  This includes such things as medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and 
religious instruction. 

Joint ownership:  Property being owned by more than one person. 

Joint physical care This means both parents have equal rights and responsibilities toward the children 
including shared parenting time with the children, maintaining homes for the children and, providing routine 
care for the children.

Legal custody or custody This means a parent has rights and responsibilities toward the children.  These 
rights include making decisions about medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and religious 
instruction.  

ien:  This is a charge on specific property to cover a debt or obligation.  

ocal Rules:  Some Iowa judicial districts have local rules that must be considered while processing your 

case.  You can find these local rules, if any, on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/District_Courts/. 
When you get to this page, click on the judicial district for the county where your case is filed. For example: 
Johnson County is in “District 6,” and so you would click on “District Six” on the left side of the page. Then 
click on the “Local Rules” link underneath (if there is one). 

inor Child:  A child under the legal age of 18 years. 

ortgage:  This is a charge on real estate for a debt owed.  Both the mortgage and the debt are written 

papers and the mortgage has been filed with the County Recorder. 

otion (form 222):  A filing in which one of the parties asks the court to order something to be done while a 

case is going on.  For example, a party might ask for temporary spousal support (alimony) or to schedule a 
hearing.  

otion and Affidavit to Serve by Publication: Form 207 is a paper that asks the court to let the party 

publish a notice in the newspaper that a case has been filed. The person tells the court what they did to try to 
find the other person to serve the papers. 

et Monthly Income:  This is the amount of income that you have available to spend after the deductions 

from your gross monthly income.  Your net monthly income might be the net amount of your paycheck.   

et Value:  This is the amount of money something is worth after subtracting all liens, encumbrances, and 
mortgages from the fair market value.  For example, if your car is worth $5,000 and there is a lien of $4,000 
against it, then the net value is $1,000. 

o Fault Divorce:  Iowa recognizes “no fault divorce,” which allows a marriage to be dissolved when there is 

evidence of a breakdown of the relationship with no likelihood it can be preserved.  With no fault divorce, a 
spouse is not required to blame the other spouse for any particular misdeed or wrong. 
   
Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF): This is the notice generated by EDMS when you, the other party, or the 
court files a document in your case.  EDMS serves (see the definition for “Serve (Service)” below) most  case 
filings by means of the NEF.  The NEF indicates who on the case was electronically served and who will need 
to be served by mail because of an exemption from electronic filing. Keep a copy of the NEF for your records. 
The NEF alerts you to log in to EDMS and look at the filings on your case, either in the Notification or the My 
Cases page for documents filed by other case parties and the court, or through the My Filings page for 
documents you filed.  If you are Petitioner in your divorce, you find the Original Notice and Petition that you 
must serve on your spouse in your My Filings page of EDMS.  

otice of Intent to File a Written Application for Default Decree: Petitioner uses form 226 if Respondent is 

“in default,” which means he or she has not filed an Answer to the Petition, and Petitioner wants to ask the 
court to sign a final divorce Decree. 

rder:  A paper signed by the judge telling a party or both parties to do something. 

riginal Notice for Personal Service (forms 204 and 204a): An Original Notice is prepared and filed by 
Petitioner and signed by the clerk of court. Petitioner serves the Notice on his or her spouse (Respondent) 
along with the Petition.  This tells Respondent that his or her spouse has filed a lawsuit for dissolution of 
marriage (divorce).

as your category and be a “Pro se” filer.  

  
Process Server:  This is a person, other than you, who personally delivers, or serves, a paper to your 
spouse.  Often this process server is the county sheriff, but it may be another person who delivers legal

  Personal property:  Personal property is all property that is not real property.  Personal property 
includes clothes, cars, boats, money, household contents, pension rights, jewelry, bank accounts,

friends and to attend school, church, and social activities. Each parent will tell the other of 
any events involving the children.

each child in advance. 

9.  The religious activities of the children will be mutually discussed and mutually planned for 

10. Neither parent will post or allow to be posted any information about the children or 

pictures of the children on the internet without the other parent’s prior, specific consent. 
11. Each parent will allow the other parent to have the children with him or her for special  

family events such as weddings, funerals, reunions, or major anniversaries and birthdays  
(e.g. grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary or 50th birthday).  The other parent will 
provide as much advance notice of special events as possible.  

12. Each parent will keep the other advised of his or her current address and telephone 

numbers for residence and business, unless this is not required to protect a victim of 
domestic abuse.  

13. If a parent takes a child out of town for more than two days, that parent will tell the other 

parent about the tip and give contact information.  

14. Each parent will give the other advance notice of any out-of-country travel.  Neither parent 
will unreasonably withhold consent or passports. The parents will give each other contact 
information, including where they will be during the travel. 

15. Some of the children's activities may conflict with visitation schedules. When possible, 
schedules will be arranged to avoid conflict. The parents will change the children's 
scheduled care as needed due to the work schedule of either parent.    The visiting parent 
still has to follow the court-ordered visitation schedule.

XI.  Tips on Handling Your Own Case in Iowa’s Courts 

.  Judges and court staff cannot give you legal advice.   

  They cannot tell you whether you should file a case, what you should put in your papers, or what 

you should say or ask in court.  Why? Because: 
  Judges and court staff must not take sides or appear to take sides in any case.  It would be 

unfair for judges or court staff to give one person an advantage over another person in a court 
case.  

 

If court staff gives you advice and it turns out to be wrong, you could lose your case.  
 
B.  Court staff cannot: 

  Tell you what you should do about anything involving your court case.  They cannot tell you: 

 

 

  A

  Whether you should file a specific paper.  
  What words or phrases you should use in a paper. 
  What persons you should file a lawsuit against. 
  How much money to ask the other party for.  
  What questions to ask witnesses or other parties.  
  Whether to appeal a judge’s decision. 
  How to fill in a form for a person involved in a case.   

Exception: If a person has a physical disability or cannot read or write, and the person explains the 
disability to a clerk, then the clerk may fill in the form.  The clerk, however, must write down only the 
exact words provided by the person who requested help. 

  Tell you the meaning of laws or court decisions.   
  Perform legal research for a person involved in a court case.  
  Predict the outcome of a case, a paper filed, or some other action in a case. 

  Provide public information contained in: dockets, calendars, case files, indexes, and reports. 
  Show or tell where to find laws or rules. 
  Identify approved court forms that might meet the needs of a person who does not have an 

attorney. 

  Answer questions about where to write in particular types of information on court forms, but not 

what words to use when filling in the forms. 

  Define terms commonly used in court. 
  Provide phone numbers for lawyer referral services. 

 

  You cannot communicate with the judge about your case by email or regular mail, unless you also 
send copies of your email or regular mail to the other people involved in your case at the same 
time. 

  You cannot talk with the judge about your case by telephone or in-person unless all other parties 

are on the phone at the same time or in the same room together.  

.  You cannot talk to the judge unless all parties and attorneys are present. 

  D

.  Court staff can:

  This rule is important because it prevents a person or an attorney from giving information to a judge 

that the other side does not know about.  This would be unfair to the other side.   

  If you want to give the judge information you think is important for your case, or you want the judge 

to take some action related to a case,  

 

If your case is electronic, you must electronically file the document as a motion or 
application (whichever is correct), so that EDMS can notify all parties of your request. 
    If your case is in paper, you must put the request in writing. (See approved Iowa court 

forms for examples of how to do this.)  

  Make enough copies for you and all the other parties. 
  Take the papers to the clerk of court office. The clerk will stamp each copy and keep 

one.  

  Deliver a copy to each of the other parties or their attorneys. Keep a copy for yourself.  

.  Be prepared 

  E

  Keep copies of all the papers you file in court and the papers you get from the other party. 
  Know what evidence you need to prove your case. If possible, ask an attorney what you need to do 

before you go to court and what to do at the court hearing.  

  Bring papers and witnesses that will help you present your side of the case.   
  Bring at least three copies of each document you want to use as evidence—one for you, one for the 

other party, and one for the judge.   

  If you are filing electronically, any document you plan to use as an exhibit at a hearing or trial can 

be submitted electronically using the Exhibit Submission event.   

  Remember to redact protected or confidential information from your exhibit submissions, 

because they will become public documents when the judge signs your final Decree. 
  If a witness refuses to come to court to testify, you can ask the court to issue a subpoena 

(pronounced “suh-peena”). It’s an order requiring a person to come to court.  Be sure to ask the 
clerk's office for a subpoena several days before your court hearing.  

  Bring physical evidence, if there is any.  This might include a canceled check, contract, or invoice.  

If your case involves damaged property, bring the damaged item or a photograph of it.   

.  Be on time  

  F

  If you are not in court when your case is called, and the other party is present, the judge might 

enter a judgment against you.   

  If neither party is on time, your case might be skipped. You might have to wait until the very end of 
the court session that day before your case is called again.  Or you might even have to come back 
on another day—possibly a few weeks later.  

.  Know and follow court rules 

  G

  Judges cannot make exceptions for people without attorneys.  You could lose your case if you do 

not follow the correct procedures.   

  When you electronically file a paper through EDMS, the system will serve that paper to the 

other party or (parties) or the other party’s attorney. 

  The Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF) will tell you who was served and whether you must send 

paper copies to anyone who is exempt from electronic filing.

  When you file a document in paper at the clerk of court office, you must mail or deliver a copy 
of that paper to the other party (or parties) or the other party’s attorney. Always keep a copy 
for your records. 

.  Be courteous and respectful 

  Make a good impression on the judge.  A judge can hold a person "in contempt of court" for bad 

behavior.  This could result in a fine or time in jail.  

  Wait for your turn to speak.  Do not interrupt the judge or the other party. If you interrupt others in 

court, the judge will stop you and instruct you to wait your turn.  
  Turn off your cell phone and other electronic devices when in court.  

.  Dress appropriately 

  You should wear business attire such as a suit, sport coat, dress, or dress slacks, if you can. 

Otherwise, wear nice, clean casual clothes and shoes.  Remove your hat or cap while you are in 
the courtroom or in the judge’s office.  

.  Speak loudly and clearly so everyone in the courtroom can hear you. 

  Judges and the other parties in court need to hear the facts correctly.  The judge needs to hear you 

clearly so that he or she can make a correct decision.  

.  If you cannot attend a court hearing or cannot be on time, you must inform the court.  

  You must have a very good reason to reschedule any court hearing.   
  To reschedule a hearing at the last minute, there must be an emergency.  
    You should immediately call the clerk of court office where your hearing is scheduled.   

  Calmly explain your problem, and ask to reschedule the hearing or trial.  Court staff will write 
down the request and contact the judge.  The judge will decide whether your reason for 
changing the hearing or trial date is serious enough to grant your request. 
  Give the clerk your phone number where you can be contacted that day. 

  If something very important comes up two or more days before the hearing, like a death in the 

family or an accident that puts you in the hospital, you must submit your request for a new hearing 
date or time in writing and file it with the clerk of court.  In a divorce case with dependent children, 
use the family law Motion (form 222) to ask the court for a new hearing date. 
  Do this as soon as you know you need to reschedule the hearing. 
 
It's more likely a judge will agree to your request if you get the other party to sign a written 
agreement to change the hearing time or date, and include it with your Motion for a new hearing 
date.   
  If your case is electronic, file the motion using EDMS, and the system will serve your request to 

  Attach the written agreement to your Motion as an “Attachment” and electronically file the

consideration. 

  If your case is in paper, after you file the Motion at the clerk’s office, deliver a copy of your 

request to the other party. 

  The clerk of court will give your request to a judge for consideration.

  Because judges are busy, you probably will not get an answer right away.   
 

  Note: If you do not show up for the trial at the time it is scheduled, and the other party does show 

up, the judge may enter a judgment in favor of the other party.
