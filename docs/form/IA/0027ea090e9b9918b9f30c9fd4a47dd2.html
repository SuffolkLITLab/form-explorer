18.   Plaintiff’s understanding of this Petition—read before signing  

When you file this Petition with the court, several legal matters are set into motion. Check 
each statement below after reading it. 

A.     I understand there will be a court hearing scheduled for 5 to 15 days after I file 
this Petition.  At this hearing, the judge will decide whether to give my child a 
Final  Protective  Order.    I  understand  that,  if  I  cannot  be  there  on  that  date,  I 
must immediately ask the court in writing to change the hearing date and I 
should contact the clerk of court.  

B.     I understand that I must attend the hearing.  If I change my mind and do not 
want a Final Protective Order, I should file with the clerk of court a "Request to 
Modify, Cancel, or Extend an Iowa Code Chapter 236A Final Protective Order" 
before the scheduled hearing. This form is available at the clerk of court's office 
and on the Iowa Judicial Branch website. 

C.     I understand that a law enforcement officer will give Defendant a copy of this 
Petition,  if  Defendant  can  be  found,  and  that  Defendant  will  receive  other 
relevant court papers even if the file is “sealed.” 

D.    I understand that if I do not attend the hearing, or if I file a request to cancel the 
protective order, the judge can dismiss the Temporary Protective Order so that 
it will no longer have any effect. 

E.    I understand that the hearing is my opportunity to tell the judge how my child 
was abused or threatened, where it happened, and when it happened.  I can 
bring people  with me  to the  hearing  who  saw  Defendant  abusing  my  child  or 
saw my child’s injuries.  I can bring any evidence I have that shows my child has 
been abused, such as medical reports, police reports, texts, voice messages, 
social media messages, pictures, other documents, or anything else that might

help  convince  the  judge  that  my  child  needs  a  Final  Protective  Order.    Bring 
paper copies of any information you want the court to see from your cell phone or other 
electronic device, such as screen shots of social media posts, pictures, texts, and emails. 

F.     I understand that the court will give primary consideration to the safety of my 
child and my child’s children.  I should tell the judge how they will be in danger 
if Defendant is given custody or unrestricted visitation.  

G.     I understand that the hearing is my opportunity to tell the judge what financial 
support my child needs.  I should be ready to provide financial information at 
the hearing, such as income and living expenses and other expenses. 

H.     I  understand that the  Final  Protective Order  could  be  in  effect  for  up  to one 
year.  I also understand that, if the Final Protective Order is granted, it may be 
extended beyond one year by filing for an extension before it expires. 

I.    I  understand  that  if I believe  Defendant  has violated the  Temporary or  Final 
Protective Order, I can call law enforcement for assistance.  I also can bring this 
to  the  court's  attention  by  filing  with  the  clerk  of  court  an  "Affidavit  to  Start 
Contempt Proceedings." This form is available at the clerk of court's office and 
on the Iowa Judicial Branch website. 

J.    I  understand  that,  if  a  Temporary  or  Final  Protective  Order  is  issued,  law 
enforcement  officers  can  use  every  reasonable  means  to  enforce  the  Order, 
including arresting Defendant for violating the Order.  I understand that, if a court 
finds that Defendant has violated the Protective Order, Defendant could be put 
in jail and have to pay a fine.  I also understand that my child could be arrested 
and jailed and fined if my child initiates or voluntarily maintains any contact with 
Defendant that  is  not  allowed  by the  order  or  my  child  otherwise  violates  the 
Protective Order. 

K.    I understand that requesting a Protective Order is a serious legal action.  If I 
want to change any part of the Protective Order, I should go back and tell the 
judge.  I should file with the  clerk of court a "Request to Change or Cancel a 
Chapter  236A  Protective  Order."  This  form  is  available  at  the  clerk  of  court's 
office and on the Iowa Judicial Branch website.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
