Custody and Visitation Case (Parents not Married) 
© 2018 Iowa Judicial Branch

In this Guide, three symbols are used to indicate whether information is specific to electronic filing, 
specific to paper filing, or applies to all cases whether electronic or in paper: 

Introduction 

 Electronic filers
 Paper filers
 All filers

 Important: Read all information marked with this arrow, whether you file

electronically or in paper.

 If you do not understand how to use these forms, or do not know if you should use these

forms, talk to an attorney.

 These forms must be used whether the filings in your case will be electronic or in paper.

 You must file electronically unless you get permission from the court to file in paper.  Contact the

clerk of court if you are unable to file electronically.

 Read this Guide carefully.  This Guide will help you through each step, but many issues in a

child custody and visitation case are complicated, and you may need to talk to an attorney.

 Submission of these forms does not guarantee your child custody and visitation case will be

completed without a trial or further questions from the judge.

 Even if you both agree on terms of custody and visitation of your children, you must have a judge

approve the terms of your child custody and visitation Decree and go through many steps in
the court process to complete your custody case.

 If you are still uncertain what to do after reading this Guide, you should talk with an attorney.  A
family law attorney can help you with all or just some of the steps in a child custody case.

 Before you file a child custody and visitation case on your own, you may want to consult an

attorney about custody, child support, and visitation in your current situation and how that might
change in a custody case.

 Important!  An Iowa court cannot decide custody or visitation if it does not have jurisdiction.

Jurisdiction is very complicated. Generally, the court will have jurisdiction if the children have lived
in Iowa for at least six months. But there are exceptions. If there is an order for custody or visitation
of the children in another state, Iowa may not be able to enter a custody and visitation order. If the
children have not lived in Iowa for six months, Iowa may not have jurisdiction. It is important to fill
out the part of the Petition about where the children have lived and what custody and visitation
orders are already in place. The court needs that information to decide jurisdiction. If Iowa does not
have jurisdiction to enter an order, the order may not be good.

 “Petitioner” is the parent who files the Petition to start a child custody and visitation case.  The
other parent is “Respondent.”  You keep these titles for the rest of your custody and visitation
case.   Petitioner and Respondent are also called the “parties” in the case.  Part IX of this Guide
defines many other legal terms you should know.

  Carefully read the specific instructions on each child custody and visitation case form.  You should 
read part X of this Guide: Iowa Court Expectations of Parents in a Custody and Visitation Case 
(Parents not Married).  You should also read part XI of this Guide: Tips on Handling Your Own 
Case in Iowa’s Courts.  

  You must determine issues of child custody, child support, and visitation during the court case 
process.  These things can be very difficult to change after a judge signs your final custody and 
visitation Decree.   

It is illegal to sign another person’s signature on any court form or other legal paper. 

Important: Clerks of court and court staff cannot give you legal advice.   
 

  Child custody and visitation laws in Iowa are in chapters 598, 598B, and 598C of the Iowa Code.  

You can find the Iowa Code in public libraries, or on the Iowa legislature’s website: 
www.legis.iowa.gov/IowaLaw/statutoryLaw.aspx. 

 Electronic Filing (EDMS) 
 

  You are required to register and electronically file your documents using the Electronic Document 
Management System (EDMS). In exceptional circumstances, you may apply to the court for an 
exemption (to be excused), from electronic filing requirements.  
 

  Because your child custody and visitation case will become a public case when the judge signs the 
final custody and visitation Decree, it is critical that you understand and know your responsibility for 
these two things: 
 

  What information is protected (or may or should be kept private); and  

  How to redact (or remove) protected information from the papers (or legal documents) 

that you file in your case.  

See the Iowa Rules of Electronic Procedure in chapter 16 of the Iowa Court Rules at:    
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Overview/.  Refer to Division VI of Chapter 16 for rules on 
protecting private information. 
 
You must still personally serve the other parent with a copy of your Petition and Original Notice, 
even if you are filing electronically.  After the Petition and Original Notice documents are 
personally served, whenever you electronically file an additional document in your case, EDMS 
will serve a copy of that document on the other parent or the other parent’s attorney if there is 
one.   

The Notice of Electronic Filing will indicate if the other parent is excused from electronic filing 
requirements, in which case, you must mail a copy or serve in paper a copy of the document on 
other parent if he or she does not have an attorney. 
 
Even if you are filing electronically, most custody and visitation forms require you to certify the 
information you are providing by handwriting your signature on the form.  These forms must then 
be scanned in and electronically filed. 
 
To view the custody and visitation forms, you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed.  Go to: 
http://get.adobe.com/reader/.

  Paper Filing 

 

 

You must receive permission from the court before you can file in paper. 

Some instructions, and some forms, are different if you are filing in paper rather than 
electronically. 

Whenever you file a paper at the clerk of court office, you must deliver a copy of that paper to the 
other party or the other party’s attorney. You should also keep a copy for yourself.  The only 
exception is the Confidential Information Form (403): Do not give a copy of that form to the other 
party. 

Because your child custody and visitation case will become a public case when the judge signs 
the final Decree, it is critical that you understand and know your responsibility for these two 
things: 

  What information is protected (or may or should be kept private); and  

  How to redact (or remove) protected information from the papers (or legal documents) 

that you file in your case.  

 

Be sure to print clearly when filling in paper forms.

Parties with Children 

 

Before using any Iowa court forms listed below, read this Guide, including part IX: “Iowa Court Expectations 
of Parents in a Child Custody and Visitation Case” and part X “Tips on Handling Your Own Case in Iowa’s 
Courts.” 

Forms a Petitioner can use to start the child custody and visitation process:  
 

Petition for Custody and Visitation (Parents not Married). 

Coversheet for a Petition for Custody and Visitation (Parents not Married).  Use only 
if filing in paper; not for electronic filing. 

Confidential Information Form.  Use only if filing in paper; not for electronic filing.  
Each party filing in paper must provide the clerk of court personal identifying information on 
this form, which will be kept confidential. 

Original Notice for Personal Service. Use only if filing electronically; not for paper 
filing.  Note: For electronic filing, a clerk of court signature page will be added to the Original 
Notice form when the clerk approves the Original Notice. Page numbering on the form has 
been adjusted to account for the addition of this page in electronic filing. 

Original Notice for Personal Service. Use only if filing in paper; not for electronic 
filing. 

Acceptance of Service of Original Notice.  Petitioner completes the top part of this form; 
Respondent completes the bottom part and returns the form to Petitioner for filing.

Motion and Affidavit to Serve by Publication. Use this form if you cannot find the other 
parent to serve a copy of the Petition (401) and Original Notice (404) by mail or in-person.  

Original Notice by Publication. Use this form if you cannot find the other parent to serve a 
copy of the Petition (401) and Original Notice (404 or 404a if filing in paper) and a judge has 
signed an Order allowing you to publish the Notice in a newspaper. Note: For electronic filing, 
a clerk of court signature page will be added to the Original Notice form when the clerk 
approves the Original Notice. Page numbering on the form has been adjusted to account for 
the addition of this page in electronic filing. 

Proof of Service by Publication. Use this form only if you also used forms 407 and 408. 

Application and Affidavit to Defer Payment of Costs.  Optional: Use this form if you 
cannot afford to pay the court filing fees. Note: If using this form, it must be filed before the 
Petition and Original Notice can be filed. If the judge approves the Application and Affidavit to

(404 or 404a). 
Affidavit of Service of Original Notice and Petition for Custody and Visitation.  Use if 
someone other than Petitioner, a sheriff, or process server delivers a copy of the Petition

Affidavit of Mailing Notice.  Petitioner must file this if he or she served Notice by 
Publication in a newspaper and asks the court for a child custody and visitation Decree by

for a final Decree. 

Request for Relief in a Custody and Visitation Case.  If Petitioner is getting a final

paper rather than electronically.  If you do not understand something, you should contact an 
attorney. Do not contact court staff about how to fill out forms.

B.  Filing your case.  

  Filing your case electronically. 

  You must register to electronically file.  For help with registration, see the eFile User Guide “How 

to Register Pro Se (Self Represented) for eFiling.” 

  After you have registered, log in to the electronic filing system at 

https://www.iowacourts.state.ia.us/EFile/ to electronically file your child custody and visitation 
case. 

For help electronically filing your case, see “How to File a New Case” at 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Training_Documents/. 

If you are unable to proceed electronically, you must receive permission from the court to file in 
paper.  Contact the clerk of court in the county where the petition will be filed for more information 
on being excused from electronic filing. 

  With your Petition (401), you must also file an Original Notice (form 404) and a Protected 

Information Disclosure (form 411) with the full version of any protected information or other 
information you have redacted or omitted from the Petition. 

If filing electronically, you will receive a Notice of Electronic Filing when the clerk of court has 
approved the filing of your Petition.

  Filing your case in paper. 

You must proceed electronically unless you have received permission from the court to file in 
paper. 

  With your Petition, you must also file a Petition Cover Sheet (form 402), an Original Notice (form 

404a), and a Confidential Information Form (form 403).  It is also recommended that you file a 
Protected Information Disclosure (form 411) with the complete version of any protected 
information or other information that you have redacted or omitted from the Petition. 

Forms 401 and 404a and, if applicable, 411: Make two copies if you can deliver copies of these 
forms to the other parent in-person or by mail. Make three copies if you are going to ask the 
county sheriff or a civil process server to deliver these forms to the other parent.  

Forms 402 and 403: You do not have to make photocopies of these forms. 

Note about making photocopies:  You should make your photocopies before you go to the 
courthouse to file your papers.  It is expensive to make photocopies at the clerk of court office. It 
is cheaper to make the copies at a business that makes photocopies or at a public library. 

Take the original forms you filled in and the photocopies to the clerk of court office in your county.  
Tell the clerk at the counter you are filing a Petition for Custody and Visitation (Parents not 
Married). 

 

Give the clerk at the counter the original forms and the photocopies of these forms: 

  401    Petition for Custody and Visitation (Parents not Married) 
  402    Coversheet for a Petition for Custody and Visitation (Parents not Married) 
  403    Confidential Information Form (Do not make copies of this form.) 
  404a  Original Notice  
  411   Protected Information Disclosure, if applicable 

Pay the filing fee, or file form 409.  (See above.)  The clerk at the counter can tell you the amount 
of the filing fee. See the term “Fees” in part VII of this Guide for a list of the fees you might have 
to pay during the child custody and visitation process. The Iowa legislature sets these fees and 
periodically raises them, so check with the clerk’s office to confirm the current filing fee.  

The clerk of court will sign the Original Notice (form 404a).  You will have to serve this form on 
(deliver it to) the other parent.  (See section C, below.) 

The clerk at the counter will time-stamp each of the copies (original and photocopies). 

C. Serve (deliver) the Original Notice (form 404 if filing electronically; form 404a if filing in paper), a 

copy of the Petition (form 401), and, if applicable, the Protected Information Disclosure (form 411) 
and the Application and Affidavit to Defer Costs (form 409) and the Court’s Order approving that 
Application on the other parent. (See the definition of “Serve (Service)” on page 26.) 

  For both paper and electronic filers: 

Important:  Petitioner has 90 days after filing the Petition to serve the Petition on Respondent (the 
other parent).  If Petitioner fails to meet this deadline the case will be dismissed. 

If you know where the other parent is, you have three options for completing service:

   Service Option 1:  You can hand the forms to the other parent yourself, or send the forms to 
the other parent by regular mail.  You must also get the other parent to sign an “Acceptance 
of Service” (form 405; see below).  After the other parent signs the Acceptance of Service 
form, you must meet the requirement for “proof of service” by:    

  If filing electronically:  

  File the Acceptance of Service form through EDMS. 
  For help, See “How to eFile to an Existing Case” at 

http://www.iowacourts.gov/eFiling/Training_Documents/. 

   If filing in paper:  

  Make a photocopy of the Acceptance of Service form for your records; and 
  Take the original Acceptance of Service form (the one the other parent signed) to the 

clerk of court office for filing.   

 

 

  405 

Acceptance of Service of Original Notice. Petitioner uses this when Petitioner 
personally delivers the Original Notice and a copy of the Petition to Respondent and 
Respondent is willing to sign the “Acceptance of Service” form. 

 

 

 

 

  Service Option 2:  You can ask the county sheriff or other civil process server to serve the 
forms on the other parent.  Note: If you are using this service method and you filed an 
Application and Affidavit to Defer Costs (form 409), and the court approved it, you must have 
the county sheriff serve form 409 and the Order approving deferral and all other papers, as the 
county sheriff will defer the service costs, but a civil process server will not. 

If you choose option 2, you must fill in two forms: 404 (if filing electronically) or 404a (if filing in 
paper), and 406 (see below). 

  406 

Directions for Service of Original Notice. Use this if you know where the other parent 
lives or works, but you want the county sheriff or other civil process server to deliver the 
child custody and visitation Petition (form 401) and Original Notice (form 404 or form 404a if 
filing in paper) to the other parent. 
 

  Give the county sheriff or other process server two copies of the: 

  Original Notice (form 404 or 404a) 
  Petition (form 401) 
  Directions for Service (form 406) 
  Protected Information Disclosure (form 411), if applicable.

that Application, if applicable. 

 

  Tell the sheriff or process server to deliver the Original Notice, Petition, Protected 

Information Disclosure, and other forms (if applicable) to the other parent. 

  The sheriff or other process server will file the “proof of service” with the clerk of court 
after you pay the service fee. If the court granted your Application to Defer Costs (form 
209), the county sheriff must be the one who delivers the forms to the other parent, as 
the county sheriff will defer the service costs, but a civil process server will not. 

  Service Option 3:  You can have another person who is not a sheriff or process server deliver 

the papers to the other parent.  If a person other than you, a sheriff, or a process server

If you do not know where the other parent is, you can ask the court for permission to give 
notice to the other parent by publication in a newspaper. 

  A court will give a Petitioner permission to give notice by publication in a newspaper only if 
Petitioner has tried several ways to find the Respondent.  Some steps you can take to find 
the other parent include:

people she or he used to work with. 

  Checking local or area phone books, or phone books where you think the other parent 

might be living. 

  Searching for the other parent using internet-based search engines or social media.  If 
you do not know how to do this, go to your local library and ask a librarian for help. 

  Contacting an attorney to help you. 
  If you cannot find the other parent, you should mail a copy of the Original Notice (form 
404), the Petition (form 401), and, if applicable, the Protected Information Disclosure 
(form 411) to the other parent’s last known address.  You must do this to get a 
Decree by default. (See part VI.A and form 425 below.)   

  If you cannot find the other parent after taking these steps, you can ask the court for 

permission to serve notice by publication in a newspaper.  To do this, you must file form 
407.

VIII. Terms Used in the Child Custody and Visitation Process 

 

cceptance of Service of Original Notice (form 405):  On this form Respondent can sign to acknowledge, 

or admit, receiving a copy of the custody and visitation Petition and Original Notice from Petitioner.  Signing 
this paper does not mean Respondent agrees to anything that is in the Petition.  (Note: the county sheriff or 
other civil process server does not need to serve the Petition and Original Notice if the Respondent signs this 
Acceptance of Service.)   

ffidavit of Mailing Notice (form 425):  This form tells the court that the person mailed a notice to the other 

party.  Petitioner must use this form if he or she served Notice by Publication in a newspaper.  Petitioner or 
Respondent must use this form if he or she asks the court for a final Decree by default. 

ffidavit of Service of Original Notice and Petition for Custody and Visitation (form 410): Use this form if 
another person who is not a sheriff or process server delivered the Petition and Original Notice to Respondent.  

ffidavit for Temporary Custody and Visitation (form 421):  On this form a parent or someone else can tell 

the court about custody and visitation before the case is finished. 

nswer (form 415 or 416): Respondent uses the Answer to respond to what Petitioner—Respondent’s 

spouse—asks for in the Petition. 

pplication and Affidavit to Defer Payment of Costs (form 409): This form asks the court for an order to 
allow Petitioner to file the Petition without paying the filing fee or the costs of service at that time. You might be 
required to pay the fee or costs later. 

over Sheet (form 402):  This form is used only in nonelectronic cases (paper filing) and it identifies the type 
of lawsuit being filed (child custody and visitation). It must be completed and filed with the Petition (form 401). 

onfidential information: Confidential information is personal information that should not be available to the 

public unless it is required by law or is material to the case.  Documents filed in an action will be available to 
members of the public upon request once the case is final when the court has approved a Decree.  

  The following information is considered confidential information in cases that are filed in paper:  

  Social Security numbers 
  Financial account numbers 
  Full dates of birth 
  Names of minor children 
 
  Personal identification numbers 
  Other unique identifying numbers 

Individual taxpayer identification numbers 

onfidential Information Form (403): This form is used only in nonelectronic cases (paper filing).  Iowa law 
requires all parties filing in paper to provide the clerk of court with complete personal identifying information on 
a Confidential Information Form.  The clerk of court will keep this form confidential and separate from the 
case.  This form is not a public record.   

ecree:  The document a judge signs that ends your child custody and visitation case. It will require you and 
the other parent to do certain things, including following child custody and visitation arrangements.  By getting 
together with the other parent and completing a Settlement Agreement (form 428) and Agreed Parenting Plan 
(form 429), you can tell the judge what you both want the final Decree to say.  The judge will review these 
agreements and determine the final terms of your Decree.  If you and the other parent do not agree how to 
settle your issues, you can tell the judge what you want the final Decree to say by filling out and filing a 
Request for Relief (form 427) and Proposed Parenting Plan (form 430). The judge will always make the final 
decision on what the Decree will say.  

nce a judge enters your Decree, papers filed during the action will be available to members of the public

upon request. 

It is important that you understand what is meant by “protected information” (defined below) and how to 
“redact” (defined below) such information on the Protected Information Disclosure (form 411).   

Default:  A Default or Default Judgment is a ruling from the court that a party did not do something that was 
required during the case process. For example, the judge could enter a default judgment if Respondent did not 
file an Answer after receiving an Original Notice. Once the court enters a Default or Default Judgment, the 
court may then issue other orders, including a final Decree. Forms 426 and 427 can be used to get a “Decree 
by default.”  

Dependent adult child:  A child age 18 or older who still requires support from parents.  For example, a child 
who is age 18 but is still in high school, or a child age 18 or older who is in college or is disabled and still 
needs support. 

Directions for Service of Original Notice (form 406):  This form gives information to the county sheriff or 
other civil process server on how and where to serve the Petition on Respondent.  See “Serve (Service)” 
below. 

Discovery:  This is the process for parties to give each other information that explains the facts about your 
family, including details of income, debts, and information about the children. You may have to do this by 
answering questions or providing papers. 

Electronic Document Management System (EDMS): This is Iowa’s Internet-based court system that allows 
parties to electronically file documents and receive filings from other parties and the court.  Electronic filing is 
required, unless the court has granted one or both parties and exception from electronic filing, and special 
court rules apply to cases that are electronically filed.  You must register to use EDMS.  See the eFiling pages 
on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at http://www.iowacourts.gov/ to request an account.  The eFiling section 
of the judicial branch website contains Overview, Login, eFiling Forms, and Training Documents sections. 

Electronic filing (eFiling): Electronic filing is the submission of documents through Iowa’s Internet-based 
court system (EDMS).  With electronic filing, you do not take a paper to the courthouse to file it, unless you 
have applied for and have received an exemption (see definition below) from electronic filing.   

Encumbrance:  This is a general term for a charge against real estate and may include liens, mortgages, and 
other charges—such as special tax assessments—against real estate.   

Equity:  This term means fairness and justice.  “Equity cases” usually include family law cases (divorce, child 
custody, and support) and real property issues, where a court must fairly divide property and responsibilities 
among the parties. 

Exemption:  All cases in the Iowa court system are presumed to be electronic.  Under exceptional 
circumstances, a party may ask the court to be excused from registering to participate in EDMS and receive 
an exemption from proceeding electronically.   

Fees:  Money you must pay to the clerk of court when you file your Petition and at other times.   
Note: The fees listed below are set by the state legislature, which sometimes changes the fees. 

1. Court fees are paid to the clerk of court in the county where the case is filed.

a. Filing fee—to start a family law case ($110). (Iowa Code section 602.8105(1)(c))
b. Court reporting fee—for each hearing in court ($40). (Iowa Code section 625.8(2))
Note on payment of court fees: At the end of your case the court can determine, or the parties can 
agree, who will pay the fees. This would include the filing fee, court fees, service fees, and costs of 
things such as a subpoena or a deposition. 

Guide to Representing Yourself in an Iowa Custody and Visitation Case (Parents not Married) 

p. 22

2. Service fees:  Money you must pay to a process server, such as the county sheriff, to serve the

other party with an Original Notice. The amount varies by county.

3. Recording fee:  If your case includes a change of real estate title, the County Recorder charges a

fee to enter your change of title to real estate.

File:  This word has two meanings: 

1. “To file” a document is the act of giving the document to the clerk of court.

 In electronic cases, this means filing a document through EDMS. The system will stamp the date
and time the document is submitted to the system and when the system generated a Notice of
Electronic Filing.

 In paper, or nonelectronic cases, filing a document means handing the paper document to the clerk

of court. The clerk will stamp on the document the date and time that the clerk received the
document for filing.

2. “File” (or “court file”) also means the folder(s) in which the clerk of court places the documents for a
court case.

Filer:  Any person or party who files a document with the court. 

Financial Affidavit (form 424):  This form provides information to the court about the parties’ property, debts, 
income, and expenses.  Each party must complete a Financial Affidavit. 

Gross monthly income:  This is the total of your income before subtracting for anything else, such as taxes, 
retirement account contributions, health insurance, etc. 

Guardian ad litem:  A person, usually an attorney, appointed to look out for the interests of someone in a 
lawsuit.  For example, a guardian ad litem might be appointed for a child or someone who is in prison.  

Iowa Rules of Electronic Procedure: These are the rules in chapter 16 of the Iowa Court Rules that govern 
electronic filing, available on the Iowa Judicial Branch website.  See Division VI of the chapter 16 rules about 
Protection of Personal Privacy.  Your case will become public when the judge signs your final decree, so it is 
critical that you understand what information you must protect from public disclosure and how to redact it from 
documents you file in your case. 

Joint custody or joint legal custody:  This means both parents have equal legal rights and responsibilities 
toward the children.  This includes such things as medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and 
religious instruction. 

Joint ownership:  When property is owned by more than one person. 

Joint physical care: This means both parents have equal rights and responsibilities toward the children 
including shared parenting time with the children, maintaining homes for the children and, providing routine 
care for the children. 

Legal custody or custody: This means a parent has rights and responsibilities toward the children.  These 
rights include making decisions about medical care, education, extracurricular activities, and religious 
instruction.  

Lien:  This is a charge on specific property to cover a debt or obligation. 

Local rules:  Some Iowa judicial districts have local rules that must be considered while processing your 
case.  You can find these local rules, if any, on the Iowa Judicial Branch website at: 
http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/District_Courts/. 
When you get to this page, click on the judicial district for the county where your case is filed. For example: 
Johnson County is in “District 6,” and so you would click on “District Six” on the left side of the page. Then 
click on the “Local Rules” link underneath (if there is one).

p. 23

 
Minor child:  A child under the legal age of 18 years. 

 

 

 

ortgage:  This is a charge on real estate for a debt owed.  Both the mortgage and the debt are written 

papers and the mortgage has been filed with the County Recorder. 

otion (form 422):  A filing in which one of the parties asks the court to order something to be done in a 

case.  For example, a party might ask for temporary child support or to schedule a hearing.  

otion and Affidavit to Serve by Publication (form 407): This is a request for the court to let the party 
publish a notice in the newspaper that a case has been filed. This is used when a Respondent cannot be 
located. The person tells the court what they did to try to find the other person to serve the papers. 

et monthly income:  This is the amount of income that you have available to spend after the deductions 

from your gross monthly income.  Your net monthly income might be the net amount of your paycheck.   

et value:  This is the amount of money something is worth after subtracting all liens, encumbrances, and 
mortgages from the fair market value.  For example, if your car is worth $5,000 and there is a lien of $4,000 
against it, then the net value is $1,000. 

otice of electronic filing: This is the notice EDMS generates when you, the other party, or the court files a 

document in your case.  EDMS serves (see the definition for “Serve (Service)” below) most case filings by 
means of the notice of electronic filing.  The notice indicates who on the case was electronically served and 
who will need to be served by mail because of an exemption from electronic filing. Keep a copy of the notice of 
electronic filing for your records. The notice alerts you to log in to EDMS and look at the filings on your case, 
either in the Notification or the My Cases page for documents filed by other case parties and the court, or 
through the My Filings page for documents you filed.  If you are Petitioner in your case, you find the Original 
Notice and Petition that you must serve on Respondent in your My Filings page of EDMS.  

otice of Intent to File a Written Application for Default Decree (form 426): Petitioner uses form 426 if 

Respondent is “in default,” which means he or she has not filed an Answer to the Petition, and Petitioner 
wants to ask the court to sign a final Decree.

riginal Notice for Personal Service (forms 404 and 404a): An Original Notice is prepared and filed by

with the Petition.  This tells Respondent that Petitioner has filed a lawsuit on child custody and visitation 
matters.  
  
Original Notice by Publication (form 408):  An announcement in a newspaper telling Respondent that the 
other parent has filed a child custody and visitation petition. 

aper filers:  Persons who have applied to the court and been granted an exemption from filing electronically.

Pro se:    This is a Latin term (pronounced “pro-say”) that means “for or on behalf of oneself.”  It is sometimes 
used to describe a person (a pro se party) who handles his or her own court case with little or no help from an 
attorney.   A pro se party is also called a self-represented party or self-represented litigant.  

 If you do not have an attorney, when you register to electronically file, you will pick “Registered Filer”

as your category and be a “Pro se” filer.

Process server:  This is a person, other than you, who personally delivers, or serves, a paper to the other 
parent.  Often this process server is the county sheriff, but it may be another person who delivers legal papers. 
(See “Service (Service)” below.) 

Protected information:  Documents filed in a child custody and visitation case will be available to members 
of the public upon request once the case is final when the court has approved a Decree.  

 Protected information is personal information that should be omitted or redacted from court filings and
not be available to the public unless it is required by law or is material to the case.  The following

received a copy of the Petition and the Original Notice, or some other document.  

Self-represented party:  This refers to a person who handles his or her own court case with little or no help 
from an attorney.  A self-represented party is sometimes called a pro se (pronounced “pro say”) party.  “Pro

 As a self-represented party, when you register to electronically file, you will pick “Registered Filer” as

your category and be a “Pro se” filer.

Serve (Service):  To give the other parent a copy of a form or document, like the Petition and Original Notice.  
Some papers must be given in-person and some papers can be sent by mail.

papers by means of the Notice of Electronic Filing. Exceptions to electronic service are made for
people who apply for and are granted an exemption from electronic filing by the court. See Rule
16.315 for rules on service of documents subsequent to the original notice.

IX. Iowa Court Expectations of Parents in a Child Custody and  Visitation Case

The judge in your case will expect each parent to act in the best interests of their children.  This 
means that: 

1. Each parent will promote respect and affection for the other parent.
2. Each parent will permit and encourage communication between the other parent and the

children.

3. Neither parent will interfere between the children and the other parent.
4. Each parent will allow the other parent reasonable telephone, email, and social media

contact with the children.

5. Each parent will have access to information about the children including medical,

educational, and law enforcement records.

6. Each parent will tell the other parent if the children suffer an illness or accident requiring
medical care.  The parents will share with each other the results of any routine medical or
dental examinations.

7. Each parent will provide advance notice to the other parent about needed medical and

dental care, and each will inform the other of any medical emergencies. Each parent will
oversee the completion of homework assignments, studying for tests, music practice, and
other extra-curricular activities while the parent has care of the children. Each parent will
encourage the children to visit friends and to attend school, church, and social activities.
Each parent will tell the other of any events involving the children.

8. The extra-curricular activities of the children will be mutually discussed and planned for

each child in advance.

child in advance.

9. The religious activities of the children will be mutually discussed and planned for each

10. Neither parent will post or allow to be posted any information about the children or

pictures of the children on the internet without the other parent’s prior, specific consent.

11. Each parent will allow the other parent to have the children with him or her for special

family events such as weddings, funerals, reunions, or major anniversaries and birthdays
(e.g. grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary or 50th birthday).  The other parent will
provide as much advance notice of special events as possible.

12. Each parent will keep the other advised of his or her current address and telephone

numbers for residence and business, unless this is not required to protect a victim of
domestic abuse.

13. If a parent takes a child out of town for more than two days, that parent will tell the other

parent about the tip and give contact information.

14. Each parent will give the other advance notice of any out-of-country travel.  Neither parent
will unreasonably withhold consent or passports. The parents will give each other contact
information, including where they will be during the travel.

15. Some of the children's activities may conflict with visitation schedules. When possible,
schedules will be arranged to avoid conflict. The parents will change the children's
scheduled care as needed due to the work schedule of either parent.    The visiting parent
still has to follow the court-ordered visitation schedule.

X. Tips on Handling Your Own Case in Iowa’s Courts

A. Judges and court staff cannot give you legal advice.

 They cannot tell you whether you should file a case, what you should put in your papers, or what

you should say or ask in court.  Why? Because:





Judges and court staff must not take sides or appear to take sides in any case.  It would be
unfair for judges or court staff to give one person an advantage over another person in a court
case.

If court staff gives you advice and it turns out to be wrong, you could lose your case.

B. Court staff cannot:

 Tell you what you should do about anything involving your court case.  They cannot tell you:

 Whether you should file a specific paper.
 What words or phrases you should use in a paper.
 What persons you should file a lawsuit against.
 How much money to ask the other party for.
 What questions to ask witnesses or other parties.
 Whether to appeal a judge’s decision.
 How to fill in a form for a person involved in a case.

Exception: If a person has a physical disability or cannot read or write, and the person explains the 
disability to a clerk, then the clerk may fill in the form.  The clerk, however, must write down only the 
exact words provided by the person who requested help. 

 Tell you the meaning of laws or court decisions.

 Perform legal research for a person involved in a court case.

 Predict the outcome of a case, a paper filed, or some other action in a case.

C. Court staff can:

 Provide public information contained in: dockets, calendars, case files, indexes, and reports.

 Show or tell where to find laws or rules.

 Identify approved court forms that might meet the needs of a person who does not have an

attorney.

 Answer questions about where to write in particular types of information on court forms, but not

what words to use when filling in the forms.

 Define terms commonly used in court.

 Provide phone numbers for lawyer referral services.

D. You cannot talk to the judge unless all parties and attorneys are present.

 You cannot communicate with the judge about your case by email or regular mail, unless you also
send copies of your email or regular mail to the other people involved in your case at the same
time.

 You cannot talk with the judge about your case by telephone or in-person unless all other parties

are on the phone at the same time or in the same room together.

Guide to Representing Yourself in an Iowa Custody and Visitation Case (Parents not Married) 

p. 28

 This rule is important because it prevents a person or an attorney from giving information to a judge

that the other side does not know about.  This would be unfair to the other side.

 If you want to give the judge information you think is important for your case, or you want the judge

to take some action related to a case,

 If your case is electronic, you must electronically file the document as a motion or

application (whichever is correct), so that EDMS can notify all parties of your request.
 If your case is in paper, you must put the request in writing. (See approved Iowa court

forms for examples of how to do this.)

 Make enough copies for you and all the other parties.
 Take the papers to the clerk of court office. The clerk will stamp each copy and keep

one.

 Deliver a copy to each of the other parties or their attorneys. Keep a copy for yourself.

E. Be prepared

 Keep copies of all the papers you file in court and the papers you get from the other party.

 Know what evidence you need to prove your case. If possible, ask an attorney what you need to do

before you go to court and what to do at the court hearing.

 Bring papers and witnesses that will help you present your side of the case.

 Bring at least three copies of each document you want to use as evidence—one for you, one for the

other party, and one for the judge.

 If you are filing electronically, any document you plan to use as an exhibit at a hearing or trial can

be submitted electronically using the Exhibit Submission event.

 Remember to redact protected or confidential information from your exhibit submissions,

because they will become public documents when the judge signs your final Decree.

 If a witness refuses to come to court to testify, you can ask the court to issue a subpoena

(pronounced “suh-peena”). It’s an order requiring a person to come to court.  Be sure to ask the
clerk's office for a subpoena several days before your court hearing.

 Bring physical evidence, if there is any.  This might include a canceled check, contract, or invoice.

If your case involves damaged property, bring the damaged item or a photograph of it.

F. Be on time

 If you are not in court when your case is called, and the other party is present, the judge might

enter a judgment against you.

 If neither party is on time, your case might be skipped. You might have to wait until the very end of
the court session that day before your case is called again.  Or you might even have to come back
on another day—possibly a few weeks later.

G. Know and follow court rules

 Judges cannot make exceptions for people without attorneys.  You could lose your case if you do

not follow the correct procedures.

 When you electronically file a paper through EDMS, the system will serve that paper to the

other party or (parties) or the other party’s attorney.

 The Notice of Electronic Filing will tell you who was served and whether you must send paper

copies to anyone who is exempt from electronic filing.

Guide to Representing Yourself in an Iowa Custody and Visitation Case (Parents not Married) 

p. 29

 When you file a document in paper at the clerk of court office, you must mail or deliver a copy
of that paper to the other party (or parties) or the other party’s attorney. Always keep a copy
for your records.

H. Be courteous and respectful

 Make a good impression on the judge.  A judge can hold a person "in contempt of court" for bad

behavior.  This could result in a fine or time in jail.

 Wait for your turn to speak.  Do not interrupt the judge or the other party. If you interrupt others in

court, the judge will stop you and instruct you to wait your turn.

 Turn off your cell phone and other electronic devices when in court.

I. Dress appropriately

 You should wear business attire such as a suit, sport coat, dress, or dress slacks, if you can.

Otherwise, wear nice, clean casual clothes and shoes.  Remove your hat or cap while you are in
the courtroom or in the judge’s office.

J. Speak loudly and clearly so everyone in the courtroom can hear you.

 Judges and the other parties in court need to hear the facts correctly.  The judge needs to hear you

clearly so that he or she can make a correct decision.

K.

If you cannot attend a court hearing or cannot be on time, you must inform the court.

 You must have a very good reason to reschedule any court hearing.

 To reschedule a hearing at the last minute, there must be an emergency.

You should immediately call the clerk of court office where your hearing is scheduled.
 Calmly explain your problem, and ask to reschedule the hearing or trial.  Court staff will write
down the request and contact the judge.  The judge will decide whether your reason for
changing the hearing or trial date is serious enough to grant your request.
 Give the clerk your phone number where you can be contacted that day.

 If something very important comes up two or more days before the hearing, like a death in the

family or an accident that puts you in the hospital, you must submit your request for a new hearing
date or time in writing and file it with the clerk of court.  In a custody and visitation case, use the
family law Motion (form 422) to ask the court for a new hearing date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
