      <pre>Iowa Judicial Branch 
Administrative Directive of the State Court Administrator, 2019-15 (Amended)* 
Production of Transcripts from Electronic Recordings of Court Proceedings  
*Amended section B.3(a)-(b) and B.4(b) on 4.30.2021 

 

A.  Purpose of this Administrative Directive 

Iowa’s courts use electronic recording equipment to record all trials and contested proceedings 
within a magistrate’s jurisdiction (see Iowa Code 602.6405(1) and (4)).  The courts also have the 
option to electronically record proceedings in all juvenile court proceedings (see Iowa Code 
232.41, 232.94, and 232.115), involuntary hospitalization or commitment and treatment of the 
mentally ill (see Iowa Ct. R. 12.20 and 13.20), and preliminary hearings in criminal cases (see 
Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.2(4)(g)).  However, there is no guidance in the Iowa Code or 
Iowa Court Rules regarding the production of written transcripts from electronic recordings of 
court proceedings.  Therefore, as authorized by Iowa Code 602.6405(4), the state court 
administrator (SCA) hereby establishes the following standard policies and procedures for the 
production of transcripts derived from electronic recordings of court proceedings. 

B.  Policies for Producing Transcripts from Electronic Recordings of Court Proceedings  

1.  Official transcript of an electronically recorded court proceeding.   

A written transcript from an electronic recording of a court proceeding, when produced 
by a transcriptionist appointed by the court or district court administrator, is the official 
transcript of the court proceeding.   

2.  Application for a Transcript of an Electronically Recorded Court Proceeding and 

Appointment of a Transcriptionist. 
a.  A person who seeks an official written transcript from an electronic recording of a 
court proceeding must e-file an Application for a Transcript of an Electronically 
Recorded Court Proceeding and Appointment of a Transcriptionist* [Form A] 1 
(hereafter, Application).  

b.  If a person requests a transcript for pursuing an appeal, the person must e-file in the 
district court both the Application – and a Combined Certificate – within seven days 
after filing a Notice of Appeal; see Iowa R. App. P. 6.803(1).  (Note: The Combined 
Certificate must be filed in both the district court and the supreme court; see Iowa R. 
App. P. 6.804(1).) 

c.  If a person wishes to obtain a written transcript, but does not require an official 
court transcript, the person may request a copy of a digital recording of a court 
proceeding and make her or his own arrangements for a transcript.  The person 
must complete and submit to the Clerk of District Court a form titled:  Request for 
an Electronic Recording of a Court Proceeding* [Form E]. 

                                                
1 All forms marked with an asterisk (*) in the directive will be available on the Iowa courts’ internal 
Sharepoint site:  Clerks Manual / Libraries / Public Forms / Digital & Video Forms and Polices.  Clerk of 
district court staff may email the forms to persons who request them.  They may be revised as needed 
with approval of the state court administrator. 

[9.9.2019; amended 4.30.2021]

3.  Appointment of a person qualified to produce an official written transcript from an 

electronic recording of a court proceeding. 

a.  When clerk of district court staff receive an Application, clerk staff will promptly 

inform the district court administrator (DCA) or a designee about the request.  The 
DCA will select a qualified transcriptionist from among judicial branch employees 
within the district who have volunteered to produce transcripts from electronic 
recordings of court proceedings.  A qualified electronic recording transcriptionist 
includes a court reporter, or a judicial branch employee who has experience and/or 
training in the production of written transcripts from electronic recordings and who 
is approved by the SCA.  

b.  If the DCA is unable to find a qualified transcriptionist within the district to produce 
the transcript, the DCA will promptly contact the SCA office.  SCA staff will select a 
qualified transcriptionist from SCA’s statewide list of qualified electronic recording 
transcriptionists who have volunteered to accept assignments to produce transcripts 
from digital recordings of court proceedings.   

c.  If SCA staff cannot find a qualified transcriptionist on the SCA’s statewide list who is 
available to produce the transcript, SCA staff will seek a transcriptionist from a 
professional transcriptionist service approved by the SCA. 

d.  When SCA staff identifies an available transcriptionist, staff will promptly provide 

the name and contact information of the transcriptionist or transcriptionist service 
to the DCA.  The DCA or a designee will prepare an Order Approving a Transcript of 
an Electronically Recorded Court Proceeding and Appointing a Transcriptionist 
[Form B – a template in the judicial interface] and request a judge or judicial 
magistrate, as appropriate, to sign and e-file the order in EDMS.   

e.  Upon receipt of the signed court order (in 3(d)), the clerk of district court will 

transmit a copy of the order to the:  

1)  Person who submitted the Application,  
2)  Designated transcriptionist, and  
3)  Clerk of the Supreme Court. 

4.  Scheduling and paying for production of a transcript for an appeal. 

a.  The transcriptionist assigned to produce an official transcript from an electronic 

recording of a court proceeding will be responsible for contacting the person who 
submitted an Application to arrange for payment and timely delivery of the written 
transcript. 

b.  The cost of a transcript will be $3.50 per page for the original and one copy to the 

party ordering the original.   

c.  If the transcriptionist is a judicial branch employee, the transcriptionist will produce 
the transcript during personal time, not during regular judicial branch work hours. 

 

[9.9.2019; amended 4.30.2021]

5.  Transcriptionist access to the electronic recording of a court proceeding. 

a.  The judicial district’s digital recordings manager (DRM) or backup DRM will locate 

the requested recording on the appropriate network drive and deliver the recording 
to the designated transcriptionist by one of the following means:  

1)  Copying the recording to a USB drive or other digital media, then sending it to 
the transcriptionist or transcriptionist agency via United Parcel Service (UPS), 
not the U.S. Postal Service,  

2)  Transmitting a copy of the recording to the transcriptionist or transcription 
services company via electronic transfer (e.g., email or FTP upload to a 
translator’s or translation services agency’s website), or 

3)  Arranging for the transcriptionist to pick up the recording at the courthouse 

where the DRM is located.   

b.  If the electronic recording of the court proceeding is in a format that requires a 

specific type of digital recording software for listening to the recording, the DRM will 
assist the transcriptionist to obtain the necessary software for the transcriptionist. 

c.  When (or immediately after) delivering the electronic recording to the 

transcriptionist, the DRM will also deliver to the designated transcriptionist a copy of 
the editable Word document titled Certificate of Filing a Transcript from an 
Electronic Recording of Court Proceeding* [Form C], and instruct the 
transcriptionist to complete and e-file the certification document with the 
completed transcript. 

d.  After completing steps B.5(a) through B.5(c), above, the DRM will complete and 

electronically sign a form titled Certification of Delivering an Electronic Recording of 
a Court Proceeding to a Transcriptionist* [Form D], save it as a PDF, then email it to 
the clerk of court in the county where the case was filed. The clerk will upload it to a 
docketed event in EDMS and select to send notification.   

6.  Transcript format for an appeal.   

a.  The transcriptionist will produce the transcript in the same format (font type and 

size, line numbering, margins, etc.) as required by Iowa R. App. P. 6.803(2) for cases 
appealed to the supreme court.   

b.  All transcriptionists shall also comply with Iowa R. Elec. P. 16.601-.608 and 
administrative directives related to redaction of transcripts prior to filing. 

7.  Completion and filing of a transcript for an appeal. 

a.  Cases within a magistrate’s jurisdiction (see Iowa Code 602.6405(1)):  An appeal 

goes to a district or district associate judge.  When filing an appeal in these cases, a 
party may supplement the record by filing a written transcript of the proceeding. 

1)  Deadline for filing a transcript:  

a) Within 10 days after filing a notice of appeal in a simple misdemeanor 

case (see Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.73(2)), or  

[9.9.2019; amended 4.30.2021] 
 

 

Page 3 of 5 

b) Within 20 days after filing a notice of appeal in a small claims or forcible 

entry and detainer case (see Iowa Code 631.13). 

2)  The transcriptionist must e-file the transcript and a Certificate of Filing a 
Transcript from an Electronic Recording of Court Proceeding* [Form C]. 

b.  All other cases: An appeal goes to the supreme court.  

1)  Deadline for filing a transcript for an appeal to the supreme court (see Iowa 

R. App. P. 6.803(3)).  The transcriptionist must e-file the completed transcript 
with the clerk of the district court within the following number of days after 
the filing of a combined certificate in the supreme court: 

a) 20 days for guilty pleas and sentencing, 
b) 30 days for child in need of assistance and termination of parental rights 

under Iowa Code chapter 232, and 

c)  40 days for all other cases. 

2)  The transcriptionist must e-file the following documents in the district court: 

a)  The completed transcript, and  
b)  A completed Certificate of Filing a Transcript from an Electronic 

Recording of Court Proceeding* [Form C]. 

3)  The transcriptionist must also e-file the following document with the clerk of 
the supreme court: a completed Certificate of Filing a Transcript from an 
Electronic Recording of Court Proceeding* [Form C]. 

8.  Transcript of a confidential proceeding. 

a.  A transcript from an electronic recording of a confidential court proceeding (e.g., 

mental health commitment hearing) will be produced only when the application for 
a written transcript is filed by a party or attorney involved in the confidential 
proceeding.  

b.  When e-filing a transcript from a confidential proceeding, the transcriptionist will: 

1)  Name and e-file the PDF copy of the transcript as follows: “Transcript-[case 

number]-Confidential.pdf,” and  

2)  In the e-filing screen where an e-filer can enter “Special Instructions for the 
Clerk of Court” – the transcriptionist will type: “Transcript of a confidential 
court proceeding.”  

c.  The transcriptionist and any court personnel involved in the transmission or 

docketing of a confidential transcript shall not reveal the contents of the electronic 
recording or the transcript to any person in any manner. 

d.  Upon review of the e-filed transcript from a confidential proceeding, the clerk shall 

set the security level of the document at 2 - if there is a self-represented party in the 
case, or level 3 - if there is no self-represented party in the case.
