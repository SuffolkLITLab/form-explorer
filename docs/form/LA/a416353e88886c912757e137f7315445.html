SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT PETITION FOR   
CUSTODY, VISITATION, and/or CHILD SUPPORT 

WHO CAN USE THESE FORMS? 

You can only use these forms if ALL of these are true: 

  You are the legal parent of the child(ren) or are recognized by law as the father having a 

right to pursue custody, visitation, and/or support;  

  The child(ren) in this case have lived in Louisiana for at least 6 months (or their whole 

lives, if under 6 months old); or  

  There is no earlier court order about custody, child protection, or adoption order for 

the child(ren) in this case in Louisiana or any other state. 

BEFORE YOU START 

Please note that these forms are for establishing child custody, visitation, and/or support only, and they 
can only be used by the legal parents of the child(ren). A child’s legal parents include the mother (who gave 
birth to the child) and the father who was either (1) married to the mother at the time of birth or (2) has 
established his “paternity” in court using or (3) filed in Court an authentic “Acknowledgment of Paternity” 
after the child was born. Being listed on the child’s birth certificate is not enough. These forms do not cover 
establishing who is a legal parent.  

ou will be filing your custody case as a “self-represented litigant.” That means you are moving your case 
forward without a lawyer.  As the person suing for custody, visitation, and/or support, you will  be known 
as  the  Petitioner  and  the child(ren)’s  other  parent  will  be  known  as  the  Defendant. All the forms you 
need  to file are attached or referenced in these instructions. 

o learn more about the child custody process, visit LouisianaLegalNavigator.org or 

LouisianaLawHelp.org. To find help, visit bit.ly/legal-referrals or 
https://www.LSBA.org/goto/FindLegalHelp. 

HOW TO COMPLETE THESE FORMS: 
Read instructions all the way through before starting. 

1. 

Decide where you will file your case. If you file your case in the wrong court, the court might reject 
your case and you might lose your filing fees. You can only file this case in: 

  The  parish  in  which  you  are  “domiciled”  (which  means  where  you  live  and  is  your 

permanent/legal home); OR 

  The parish in which the child(ren)’s other parent is domiciled; OR 

  The parish in which you and the child(ren)’s other parent were last domiciled together as 

a married couple. 

The parish you choose will be written at the top of each document you fill out (more instructions 
later). 

Think about what you are asking the court to do. When you are asking the court for custody, 
you need to recommend: (1) what type of custody you want, and (2) who should have the final 
decision-making authority for major decisions concerning the child(ren). If you and the other party 
agree  about  the  proposed  custody  arrangement,  the  Court  can  approve  custody  as  a  “Consent 
Judgment.” Note that if you seek sole custody or seek to restrict visitation of the other parent, you 
will have a higher “burden of proof” and must have strong evidence to show why that custody 
arrangement 
at  www.bit.ly/la-custody. 
 

is  necessary.  Learn  more

2. 

Think about how you will deliver (or “serve”) your court case on the other party. If you and 
the child(ren)’s other parent agree about custody and are willing to speak about the process, you 
can ask the other parent to “waive” service of process. Your spouse will just need to sign a 
waiver form before a notary. If they will not waive service and they live in Louisiana, you must 
ask the court to have the Sheriff serve them at home or work. If they will not waive service and 
they live in another state, you will have to use the “Long Arm” process to serve your spouse 
(more instructions below). 
 
Figure out your case “filing fees.” Call the Clerk of Court of the parish where you plan to file 
your case and ask about the costs to file for custody, visitation, and/or support. If you can pay the 
court fees, get your payment ready – a money order or debit/credit card is best. If you cannot afford 
to  pay  the  court  fees,  you  can  fill  out  an  “IN  FORMA  PAUPERIS  AFFIDAVIT”  or  “IFP” 
(www.bit.ly/in-forma-pauperis).  The  IFP  asks  the  court  to  delay  (but  not  eliminate)  the  cost  of 
filing. You may still have to pay fees at the end of the case. The court could also order the other 
parent to pay them, or the two of you to split the costs. You must ask for the payment 
arrangement you want in your petition. If required, fill out the IFP but do not sign it. 
 
Get your petition ready to file. Fill in the top part (but leave the “Docket No.” blank) and all other 
blanks on the pages marked “(1a – PETITION)”, “(1b – VERIFICATION”), and “(1c – ORDER),” 
but do not sign yet. Find a notary (www.bit.ly/la-notaries), ask about their fees, and schedule an 
appointment. Bring your Photo ID and your original, unsigned documents to your appointment. If 
you are filing the “IFP,” bring an adult witness that can speak to your financial situation to 
your appointment as well. Sign the VERIFICATION (and IFP, if required) in front of the notary.  
Make at least one (1) copy of your completed PETITION. 
 
File your petition with the court. Take your filing fees or IFP, your copy of the PETITION, and 
all of the original pages you filled out to the Clerk of Court’s Office where you will file your case. 
Go to the Civil Department and  tell the staff that you do not have a lawyer, and that you want to 
file your suit. Ask the Clerk of Court to stamp a date AND write the docket number of your case on 
your copy of the PETITION. Keep your copy of the PETITION in a safe place. 

Have the other party served. You will provide information about how to serve them at the end of 
the PETITION. You need to give the clerk an address (home or work) where the sheriff can find 
the defendant to  deliver the papers. If the address is hard to find, give the clerk directions. If the 
address is a work  address, you MUST provide the days of the week and times at which the  
defendant can be found  at work. 
 
Mark your calendar for your court date(s). The Clerk of Court’s office will assign your case to 
a Judge and a  Hearing Officer (if there is one). The judge will then set hearing dates for your 
case and the Clerk of Court will  inform you of the hearing dates (usually by mail).   

Fill out any court-requested forms. Before your first hearing, the Court may send you forms. Fill 
them out and make at least two copies. Then, submit the original forms to the court and mail one copy 
to the other party or their attorney. Keep the last copy for yourself.  

Attend your court date(s) and receive your judgment. At your first hearing, the hearing officer 
or judge will review your paperwork and ask questions to figure out what arrangement is in “the 
best  interest  of  the  child.”  The  Court  will  then  make  a  recommendation  about  a  custody  and 
visitation plan.  

However,  if  you  do  not  agree  to  the  hearing  officer’s  recommendation,  then  you  must  file  an 
“objection” within 5 days (ask the Court for the form) and prepare to go to another court date in 
front of the judge. At that court date, you should be prepared to prove your case with things like: (1) 
witness testimony  (friends, relatives, co-workers, therapists, teachers, church pastors, or anyone 
who can testify as to  the fact that you are a responsible and loving parent or that the other parent 
is not responsible or  loving), (2) screen-shots of text messages or Facebook posts showing you to 
be a “good” parent or the  other  parent  to be a  “bad” parent, (3) pictures, (4) certified  medical 
records,  or  (5)  school  records  as  to  why  you  should  receive  whatever  custody/visitation 
arrangement you ask for.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
