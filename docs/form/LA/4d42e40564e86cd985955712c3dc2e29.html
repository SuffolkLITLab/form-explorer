      <pre>       The  information  provided  here  is  general  and  may  not  apply  to  your  specific  case. 
Service can be complicated and it is very important that it is done right. If you are not sure 
how you must serve your paperwork, ask a lawyer. The three primary areas where service 
is required: subpoenas, service of original suits, and of subsequent pleadings. The “service 
of process” of the original suit on persons is addressed below. 

SERVICE of PROCESS on PERSONS 

●What is service and citation? 

The law requires that the party(s) being sued is given “formal notice of the certified copy of the 
petition” that you filed (service); time delays in which to respond, date of issuance, person being 
cited, title and location of the court,  and/or notice of any  court dates set  in  the case  (citation). 
These provide “due process” to the other party(s). Until the other party(s) has been properly served, 
the Court cannot make any permanent orders or resolve the dispute.  

●Are service and citation required in all cases? 

They  are  required  in  all  civil  cases  except  summary  and  executory  proceedings,  C.C.  Art.  102 
divorces, and juvenile cases. Without them, “all proceedings are absolutely null.” 

●Are there time delays for requesting the service and citation  once the case has been filed? 

Service of the citation must be requested on all named defendants within ninety days of the 
commencement of the action.   

●Who can serve the citation? 

Except  as  otherwise provided by law, service shall be made by the sheriff of the parish where 
service is to be made or of the parish where the action is pending. Providing information such as 
“the best time to serve,” the color of the house, or even a photo of the defendant can be useful to 
the sheriff. 

●What if you do not know the defendant’s address? 

A conscientious search must be made to locate the whereabouts of the defendant before you can 
ask  for  the  court  to  “classify”  the  defendant  as  an  absentee.  See  (4)  below.  Here  are  some 
inexpensive tips to track someone down: 

Send a letter to the person’s last address. Under your return address, add and write 
“Return Service requested. Do not Forward.” If the  defendant filed an address change 
with the USPS, you will get the letter back with the new address. Get more 
information from the   USPS; 
Call “411” for the city or cities where you think the person may live or work; 
Search free online telephone directories or reverse telephone directories; 
Search online sites that search for people for a small fee; 
Search social networking sites; 
Contact friends or relatives of the defendant; 
Search property records at the courthouse; 
If you believe the person is in a Louisiana state prison, contact the Louisiana Department 
of Corrections; http://www.doc.la.gov/pages/contact-us/institutions/ ; 
If you believe the person is in a federal prison, contact the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/LocateInmate.jsp ; 
For parish jail, contact your local sheriff.

How service of process on persons can be accomplished (types): 

1. 

Personal: 

Personal service (in Louisiana) is made when a proper officer directly tenders the citation 
 
or  other  process  to  the  person(s)  to  be  served.  It  can  be  made  wherever  the  defendant  can  be 
reached.  Personal  service  is  a  requirement  when  service  is  made  at  the  defendant’s  place  of 
employment or when the defendant is temporary living at someone else’s residence.  

2. 

Domiciliary: 

Domiciliary service (in Louisiana)  on the other hand, is made when a proper officer leaves 
 
the citation or other process with another person who is of suitable age (usually over the age of 12) 
and discretion residing at the defendant’s principal place of residence. It is considered his principal 
place of dwelling (domicile)  if it is his residence and he has the intent (usually evidenced by such 
 
things as: utility bill, mail, has lived there for at least six months, voter registration, driver’s 
license, etc.) to remain in place there.  

Note: 

● 
 
 
 

Going forward in the legal proceeding, it is a good practice to establish the  
relationship between the defendant and the person who accepted service at the  
residence. Example: “Service was made domiciliary on 04 September 2013,  
on Jane Doe, who is the girl friend of the defendant.” 

3.  Waiver: 

 

 
The defendant can also expressly waive citation and service thereof by any written 
waiver (a sworn affidavit is required in divorces).  A certified copy of the petition that you filed 
with the Court must be given to the defendant before the waiver is  executed. It is the                                                                    
responsibility of the petitioner to get a certified copy from the Clerk of Court to send off to the 
defendant.  This process is usually accomplished by mailing a waiver (affidavit form 
acknowledging receipt of a certified copy of the petition; waiving formal citation; service of 
process; all legal delays; notice of trial; and appearance at trial) and the certified copy of the 
petition to the defendant (in Louisiana or even out of state). A default judgment can be obtained 
once the waiver is filed in the suit record. 

4. 

Absentee:

SRR/10-01-13.     

When a person’s whereabouts is not known or when the person cannot be found and 

 
served even after a conscientious effort, though he may be domiciled or actually present in the 
state or elsewhere.  In such cases, you must seek to have an attorney at law appointed 
(commonly referred to as a curator) by the court to represent the absentee   defendant. The                                          
petitioner is responsible for the costs associated with the services of a curator and this can run as 
much as $400 or higher. 

A person whose whereabouts is known within or out of state is not an absentee  
and a curator should not be appointed to represent that person. A judgment  
obtained with  this improper procedure is null. 
A diligent or conscientious effort on the part of the petitioner usually involves but 
is not limited to: last known address,  telephone book, friends and relatives,  
internet, See also (What if you do not know the defendant’s address?) tips above.

A sheriff in Louisiana is not authorized to make service of process in another state.  The 
Clerk of Court where the petition has been filed will therefore not facilitate service on out-of-state 
defendants. It is the responsibility of the petitioner to facilitate service. First, a certified copy of 
the petition and the citation is obtained from the Clerk of Court. Second, a person who resides in 
another state can be served (using what is referred to as the long-arm-service) in the following 
ways: 

Non-resident of Louisiana but in USA:

involves the use of the US postal service or a commercial courier (Fed Ex; UPS,  
etc.); 

(a).  Registered or certified mail at his place of domicile or postal address. This  
 
 
(b).  Authorized Officer who can make service where the defendant resides. This will  
usually require the process being mailed to a sheriff in another state with an  
 
accompanying affidavit …if the out-of-state sheriff does not have one. A fee  
 
is usually charged by the out-of-state sheriff;  
 
(c). 
Private process server authorized by the court.   
 
Notes:

Third, a default judgment cannot be rendered against a defendant and no hearing  
can be  held (except for domestic violence protective order cases) until thirty (30)  
days after the filing in the suit record of the long-arm-service affidavit of the  
individual who either: 

(i).  Mailed the process to the defendant, showing that it was enclosed in an envelope  
 
 
 

with proper postage and properly addressed; the contents (citation and certified  
copy of the petition) of the envelope; and the date it was deposited in the    
US mail. To this affidavit, the return receipt (green card) must be attached;  or 

(ii).  Utilized the services of a commercial courier to make delivery of the process to  
 
 
 

the defendant, showing the name of the commercial courier; the date; the address  
at which the process was delivered to the defendant.  To this affidavit, the   
commercial courtier’s confirmation of delivery must be attached;  or 

  
 

(iii).  Actually delivered the process to the defendant, showing the date, place, and  
 

manner of delivery. 

6. 

Non-resident of Louisiana and in another country: 

This 

type  of  service  can  be 

the  most  complicated  and  expensive.  See 
 
http://travel.state.gov/law/judicial/judicial_680.html 
that  allow  service  by 
international mail and the rules under The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial 
and Extra-Judicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters.

The Clerk of Court where the suit is filed will facilitate service. If in the same parish, the 
service is usually made personally on the inmate in jail. If the inmate is out of parish, the process 
is sent to the Sheriff where the inmate is located. In most instances  they will “deliver” the process 
to the warden at the prison facility and this is where additional safeguards of the process (delivery 
of the citation and certified copy of the petition) is provided by law.

Providing the inmate’s details such as the DOC number is helpful.    
See  http://www.doc.la.gov/quicklinks/offender-info/offender-locator/ 
When service is made on the warden or his designee at the prison, proof of that  
service may be filed in the suit record of the affidavit of the prison official who  
 
served the citation and certified copy of the petition on the incarcerated  
person.  You may have to provide a fill-in-the-blank affidavit for the prison  
official (usually done  by sending it to the Clerk of Court with the petition).   
If that affidavit is not forthcoming, the petitioner is able to rely on the notice of  
service from the clerk of court that the prison official/incarcerated person was  
served.   But, service will be deemed to have been accomplished, ten (10) days  
from when the prison official received the process.   

This type of service is somewhat complicated as there is an overlapping of service under 
 
the long-arm-service statute and service on   an  incarcerated  person.  It  also  depends  on  whether 
the inmate is in federal prison or state prison. Service in federal prisons usually requires that the 
local authorized person in that state (sheriff or constable) make the service.  The Clerk of Court 
where  the suit has been filed will not make service for out-of-state defendants. The petitioner has 
to facilitate it.

For federal prison requirements and more information, See:  
http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/LocateInmate.jsp 
It is advisable to call the prison facility to find out what is needed as well as  
applicable costs. An affidavit may need to be provided to the out-of-state warden  
or sheriff. 
Obviously, the petitioner will need to mail the process by certified or registered  
mail to the person authorized to make service in the other state (similar to the  
long-arm-service statute).  
The resulting proof of service that gets submitted to the court should include: the  
petitioner’s affidavit and green card receipt that that process was mailed out  
together with the affidavit of the prison officer or authorized person that they  
did make service on the defendant. 
Since you are likely to incur a fee for the out-of-state service, there is a greater  
likelihood that the prison officer or authorized person will execute and return an  
affidavit evidencing that service was made.   But, if no affidavit is forthcoming,  
the petitioner could rely on the long-arm-service receipt. Service (cautious in  
covering all bases) could be deemed to have been accomplished, ten (10) days  
from when the prison official signed the green card  plus the thirty (30) days from 
when your long-arm-service affidavit is filed into the suit record, for a total of  
forty (40) days.  

Private Process Server: 

. 

  9

When the sheriff has been unable to make service on the defendant (there could be multiple 
 
reasons such as: “dodging”   service of process, can’t be located, etc.), upon a Motion of a party, 
the  court  will  appoint  a  qualified  (a  licensed  Louisiana  private  investigator  shall  be  presumed 
qualified)  person  over  the  age  of  18,  not  a  party  to  the  case,  and  who  resides  in  Louisiana  to 
 
make service of process in the same manner as is required of Sheriffs. The party requesting 
the services of the server is responsible for any costs. The private process server is usually required 
to submit an affidavit of how (domiciliary or personal) and when (date and time) the service of 
process was made on the defendant.

Notes: 
● 
 
 

The party making the Motion is responsible for facilitating the service through the 
private process server. This involves  sending the private process server the  
citation and certified copy of the petition that needs to be served. 

● 
 

Most licensed process servers have their own affidavit of service. Upon receipt,  
the petitioner is required to file this affidavit into the suit record. 

10.  General: 

Subsequent to the original petition, unless a pleading(s) needs to be served by the Sheriff, 

 
all parties to the litigation must provide each other (by mail or fax), copies of pleadings that are 
being filed with the Clerk of Court. A certificate of service  must be filed in the suit record that 
this has been done and this is usually done within the pleading that is being filed.
