      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>INSTRUCTION SHEET FOR PARENT’S SEEKING  
MODIFICATION OF PRIOR “CONSENT CUSTODY JUDGMENT” 

hese  forms  are  applicable  only  if  the  court  has  previously  issued  a  custody  judgment 
regarding your children. If a court has not previously issued a judgment, you may want to 
use  the  “Parent’s  Petition  to  Establish  Custody  or  Visitation.”  To  proceed,  you  will  need 
the  docket  number  from  your  previous  case  (including  related  matters),  the  exact  name 
and  address  of  the  other  parent  involved  (or  their  attorney),  and  the  exact  name(s)  and 
birthday(s) of all children involved.  
  
As  the  person  filing  this  form,  you  will  be  known  as  the  “mover”  in  the  case.  The  other  party  will  be 
referred  to  as  the  “respondent.”  You  will  be  filing  your  divorce  as  a  “self-represented  litigant,”  which 
means you are responsible for your case and no attorney will be representing you.  

HOW TO COMPLETE THE FORMS: 

These  forms  are  titled  “RULE  FOR  MODIFICATION  OF  PRIOR  CONSENT 
CUSTODY  JUDGMENT”,  “VERIFICATION,”  and  “ORDER.”  Make  sure  that  all  of 
the important blanks are filled in, especially the defendant’s address at the bottom left-hand side 
of the “ORDER.” Do NOT write anything in the blank next to “Docket No.” You must sign the 
Verification Form in the presence of a Notary Public.  

Take all of the pages to the Clerk of Court’s Office located in the parish indicated on the forms. 
You should also bring one (1) xeroxed copy of the forms with you. Go to the Civil Department 
and tell the clerk that you do not have a lawyer, and that you want to file your suit.  

You will need to check with your local Clerk of Court to determine the case “filing fee.” If you 
cannot  afford  to  pay  the  fee  when  you  file  your  case,  you  can  include  an  “IN  FORMA 
PAUPERIS AFFIDAVIT,” which asks the court to delay (but not eliminate) the cost of filing. 
Fill out all sections of the IN FORMA PAUPERIS AFFIDAVIT. Reference your check stubs to 
fill out section (7) and be sure to sign this document in the presence of a notary. This document 
can be found on the list of available forms, and is labeled with the number “2” at the bottom. If 
you are able to pay the court fees, you can skip this step. 

Ask the clerk to file all of the forms. Also ask the clerk to date stamp the copy you brought of the 
forms for you to keep. 

 

 

You need to give the clerk an address (home or work) where the sheriff can find the defendant to 
deliver the papers. If the address is hard to find, give the clerk directions. If the address is a work 
address, you MUST provide the days of the week and times at which the defendant can be found 
at work.  

The  Clerk  of  Court’s  office  will  assign  your  case  to  a  Judge  and  a  Hearing  Officer  (if  there  is 
one), and send your petition to that Judge’s office so that they will set hearing dates.  Once the 
dates  have  been  set  by  the  court,  the  clerk  of  court  will inform  you  by  mail.   Be  sure  to mark 
those dates on your calendar. 
 
At  the  hearing  in  front  of  a  judge,  you  should  be  prepared  to  prove  your  case  with  witness 
testimony (friends, relatives, co-workers, therapists, teachers, church pastors, or anyone who can 
testify as to the fact that you are a responsible and loving parent or that the other parent is not as 
responsible or loving). You can bring screen-shots of text messages or facebook posts, certified 
medical records, school records, and other evidence, to show why you the court show award the 
custody arrangement you are requesting. Be sure to bring all your evidence and witnesses to 
the hearing.
