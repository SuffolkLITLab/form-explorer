      <pre>SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT PETITION FOR 102 DIVORCE 
(NO MINOR CHILDREN) WITH REQUEST FOR INCIDENTAL RELIEF 

You may use these forms ONLY if ALL of these are true: 

• You and your spouse do not have any children under age 18, regardless of who the biological

father is, that were born or adopted during your marriage;

• You or your spouse is not currently pregnant;
• You and your spouse are still living together, or are living separate and apart, but have not yet

lived apart for the one hundred eighty (180) days;
• You or your spouse currently live in Louisiana;
• Your spouse is not in prison;
• Your spouse is not a servicemember on active duty in the U.S. Military;
• You and your spouse are not in a “covenant marriage” (If you have a covenant marriage, then
you would have agreed to pre-marriage counseling and a longer time for living separate and
apart. You would have also completed a “Declaration of Intent” and filed it with your marriage
certificate.)

BEFORE YOU START 

If you can, try to find a lawyer to help you first. This is very important if domestic violence is an issue. 
Divorces in domestic violence situations have important deadlines and certain benefits that affect when 
and how you file a case in court. Some benefits that may be affected if you file this form rather than a 
divorce  for  domestic  violence  situations  may  include  limitations  on  spousal  support,  community 
property, and a lengthier time frame to obtain you divorce. Again, it is in your best interest to find a 
lawyer to help you. 

This Article 102 Divorce can be filed before you and your spouse have lived separate and apart for the 
required length of time, which is 180 days if you do not have minor children under age 18 born or 
adopted  during  the  marriage.  Filing  this  divorce  affects  community  property  by  “terminating”  the 
community at the time the case is filed. That means new property or debts either spouse acquires while 
waiting  for  divorce  will  not  be  considered  community  property.  It  is  possible  to  ask  the  court  for 
“exclusive use and occupancy” of the home or other property while waiting the required time if you 
and your spouse do not agree who should have the right to use the family’s property.  

You will be filing your divorce as a “self-represented litigant.” That means you are handling your own 
case without a lawyer. As the person suing for divorce, you are the “Petitioner.” Your spouse is the 
“Defendant.” All the forms you need to file for a divorce are part of this forms packet or they are 
mentioned in the instructions. These forms assume that your spouse will not challenge or respond to 
the divorce. The name for this is an “uncontested” divorce.  

To learn more about the divorce process, visit LouisianaLegalNavigator.org or 
LouisianaLawHelp.org. To find help, visit bit.ly/legal-referrals or 
http://www.LSBA.org/goto/FindLegalHelp. 

HOW TO COMPLETE THE FORMS 
Read instructions all the way through before starting. 

1.

Decide in which court you must file your case. If you file your case in the wrong court, then
you might lose the filing fees you paid. If the case accidentally goes forward in the wrong
parish, your divorce will not be valid, and you will not be legally divorced.
You can only file your divorce case in:

• The parish in which you are currently “domiciled” (which means where you live and

where your permanent/legal home is); OR

• The parish in which your spouse is domiciled; OR

• The parish where you and your spouse last lived together as a married couple.

2.

Consider how you will serve your divorce papers on your spouse. “Serve” means the way

you are required by law to get certain legal papers to your spouse on the other side of your case. 
If  you  and  your  spouse  agree  about  getting  a  divorce,  you  can  ask  your  spouse  to  “waive” 
service of process and other legal delays. Getting a waiver will make the process go faster. 
Your spouse must sign a waiver form before a notary. If your spouse will not waive service and 
he/she lives in Louisiana, you must ask the court to have the Sheriff serve him/her at home or 
work. If your spouse will not waive service and he/she lives in another state, you will have to 
use the “Long Arm” process to serve your spouse (more instructions below). 

Figure out your case “filing fees.” Call the Clerk at the Court for the court where you plan 
to file your case. Ask how much it costs to file for divorce. If you can pay the court fees, get 
your  payment  ready.  Find  out  what  kind  of  payment  the  Clerk  of  Court  will  accept.  For 
example, find out if you can use a money order, a credit card, etc. If you cannot afford to pay 
the court costs to file your case, you can fill out an “IN FORMA PAUPERIS AFFIDAVIT” 
or “IFP” (bit.ly/in-forma-pauperis). The IFP asks the court to delay (but not eliminate) paying 
the cost of filing and other court fees. You may still have to pay fees at the end of the case. 
The court could also order your spouse to pay them, or the two of you to split the costs, but 
you must ask for the payment arrangement you want in your petition. If required, fill out the 
IFP but do not sign it yet. 
NOTE: It is common that the clerks at the Clerk of Court’s office where you plan to file your 
divorce can serve as a notary for these documents. Call the Clerk’s office in advance of filing 
to see if this service is available. 

Get your petition ready to file. Fill in the top part (called the “caption”). Fill in all blanks on 
the pages marked “(1a - PETITION)” and “(1b – VERIFICATION),” but do not sign yet. Find 
a notary, ask about their fees, and schedule an appointment. (Learn more about notaries here: 
bit.ly/la-notaries.) Bring your Photo ID and your original, unsigned documents to your notary 
appointment.  If  you  are  filing  the  “IFP,”  bring  an  adult  witness  that  can  speak  to  your 
financial  situation  to  your  appointment  as  well.  Sign  the  VERIFICATION  (and  IFP,  if 
required) in front of the notary. Make at least one (1) copy of your completed PETITION.  

File your petition with the court. Bring these with you to the Clerk of Court’s Office where 
you will file your case: filing fees or IFP, your copy of the PETITION, all the original pages 
marked with “1a” and “1b” at the bottom, and the Rule to Show Cause Setting Hearing on 
Incidental Matters (marked at the bottom as “2-RULE TO SHOW CAUSE on INCIDENTAL 
MATTERS”). Go to the Civil Department and tell the staff that you do not have a lawyer, and 
that you want to file your divorce. Ask the Clerk of Court to “clock stamp” AND write the 
docket number of your case on your copy of the PETITION. The court will fill out the 2-RULE 
TO SHOW CAUSE on INCIDENTAL MATTERS setting a hearing date. You must serve a 
notice of this court hearing date on your spouse. 
NOTE:  You  will  need  your  docket  number  and  the  date  you  filed  your  petition  for  other 
documents you file in your case. Keep your copy of the Petition for Divorce in a safe place.  

If your spouse is willing to waive service of process, ask the Clerk of Court’s office for a 
“certified copy” of your Petition when you file. Hand or mail your spouse the certified copy 
of your divorce, along with the “Sworn Affidavit of Waiver of Service and Process,” which is 
marked “(3a – WAIVER).” He/She will need to find a notary and sign the WAIVER in the 
notary’s presence, then return the waiver back to you or file it directly with the Clerk of Court. 
If your spouse doesn’t file it for you, you must file the WAIVER with the Clerk of Court. After 
the  WAIVER  is  signed  and  notarized,  then  you  must  wait  one  hundred  eighty  (180)  days 
without a reconciliation before moving on to Step 7 below. 
NOTE: For a definition of reconciliation, go to https://louisianalawhelp.org/resource/divorce-
dictionary/BE7390C6-171C-4EB0-8A18-D9C5F50C14F5. 

If regular service is required on your spouse and your spouse lives in Louisiana, you must 
provide your spouse’s information at the end of the PETITION. Check back with the Clerk of 
Court’s office about 1-2 weeks after you have filed your case to see if the Sheriff served your 
spouse. Once the Clerk of Court’s office tells you that your spouse has been served, you must 
wait at least three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date your spouse was served and 
without a reconciliation before moving on to Step 7 below.  

If regular service is required on your spouse and your spouse lives in another state, ask 
the Clerk of Court for a “certified copy” of your Petition and a “Citation for Long Arm Service” 
when you file. Have the certified copy of the Petition delivered to your out-of-state spouse at 
his/her  physical  address  either  by  United  States  Postal  Service  certified  mail  or  a 
commercial delivery service (like FedEx or UPS). You must have a return receipt or proof

of delivery to submit to the court. Once you receive the return receipt or proof of delivery, fill 
out the AFFIDAVIT OF LONG ARM SERVICE, which is marked “(3b – LONG ARM)” and 
sign it in front of a notary. Then, file that document and your proof of delivery in your case 
with the Clerk of Court. You must then wait one hundred eighty (180) days from the date you 
filed the AFFIDAVIT OF LONG ARM SERVICE and without a reconciliation before moving 
on to Step 7 below. 

Wait the required time without reconciling and call the Clerk of Court to check the status 
of your case. You must live separate and apart for one hundred eighty (180) days without a 
reconciliation. Make sure your spouse has not filed an “Answer” or other pleading. If your 
spouse has filed an “Answer” to the lawsuit, check with the court to see if any hearings have 
been scheduled. When you call, ask the Clerk of Court staff whether you are required to file 
the form titled “APPENDIX 27.0A: LA. C.C.P. ART. 102 DIVORCE CHECKLIST.” Also, 
ask the Clerk of Court if the assigned judge requires in-court testimony and not Affidavits of 
Correctness. 

Prepare  your  divorce  paperwork.  The  next  step  is  to  complete  the  form  marked  “(4-
AFFIDAVIT)” and sign it in the presence of a notary! Fill out the caption only on the RULE 
TO SHOW CAUSE WHY ART. 102 DIVORCE SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED marked “(5-
RULE RE DIVORCE).” If the Clerk of Court told you that you do not have to fill out the 
“Appendix 27.0A Divorce Checklist” mentioned above, make sure you fill out the “Petitioner’s 
Certification”  on  the  page  marked “(7-  JUDGMENT).”  For the  “Petitioner’s  Certification,” 
you will need to know the date of service and whether it was domiciliary or personal service. 
(See LouisianaLawHelp.org/resource/understanding-service-of-process-article for definitions 
of domiciliary and personal service.) 

File your Rule to Show Cause. Bring a copy and the original of: (i) the AFFIDAVIT (marked 
“(4-AFFIDAVIT)”), (ii) the RULE TO SHOW CAUSE WHY ART. 102 DIVORCE SHOULD 
NOT  BE  GRANTED  marked  “(5-RULE  RE  DIVORCE)”),  (iii)  the  JUDGMENT  OF  102 
DIVORCE  WITHOUT  MINOR  CHILDREN  marked  “(7-JUDGMENT),”  and  (iv)  the 
completed Appendix 27.0A DIVORCE CHECKLIST (if necessary) to the Clerk of Court’s 
office.  Ask  the  Clerk  of  Court  to  file  them.  Later,  the  court  will  fill  out  the  5-RULE  RE 
DIVORCE setting a hearing date. You must have this document served on your spouse. 
NOTE: The rule to show cause why the 102 divorce should not be granted should be filed 
within two years of service of the Petition on the Defendant or of the Defendant’s execution of 
waiver of service of the original petition. If the rule is not filed within this time, you may have 
to re-file a petition for divorce and pay the filing costs again.  

If your spouse is willing to waive service of process, then ask the Clerk of Court’s office for 
a “certified copy” of the Rule when you file. Hand or mail your spouse the certified copy of 
your divorce, along with the “Waiver of Service of Rule for 102 Divorce,” which is marked 
“(6-WAIVER).” Your spouse must find a notary and sign the WAIVER in front of the notary’s 
presence, then return the waiver back to you or file it directly with the Clerk of Court. If your 
spouse doesn’t file it for you, then you must file the WAIVER with the Clerk of Court. 

Attend your court hearing and file for your Judgment of Divorce. Be prepared to attend 
the hearing on the date listed in the 5-RULE RE DIVORCE. You may want to bring a copy of 
the  JUDGMENT  OF  102  DIVORCE  WITHOUT  MINOR  CHILDREN  marked  “(7- 
JUDGMENT)”  with  you.  The  court  may  take  testimony  of  the  parties  before  ruling. 
Alternatively,  the  court  may  waive  the  appearance  of  the  parties  and  issue  its  ruling  and 
completing the JUDGMENT.  

ou are considered legally divorced as of the date your Judge has signed your JUDGMENT OF 102 
DIVORCE WITHOUT MINOR CHILDREN. If you were granted “In Forma Pauperis” status, then 
the court should send you a certified copy of your Default Judgment of Divorce. If not, you can request 
one for a fee. Keep this certified copy for your records.
