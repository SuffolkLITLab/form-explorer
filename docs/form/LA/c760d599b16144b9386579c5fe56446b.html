      <pre>SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT PETITION FOR 103(1) DIVORCE 
(WITH MINOR CHILDREN) FOR DIVORCE ISSUE ONLY and FOR 
REQUESTING USE OF ALLOWED LAST NAME 

WHO CAN USE THESE FORMS? 

ou can only use these forms if ALL of these are true: 

•  You and your spouse are currently pregnant or have children, regardless of paternity, 

currently under age 18 that were born or adopted during your marriage;  

•  You and your spouse have already been living separate and apart for at least 365 days; 
•  You or your spouse currently live in Louisiana; 
•  Your spouse is not in prison; 
•  Your spouse is not a servicemember on active duty in the U.S. Military; and 
•  You and your spouse are not in a “covenant marriage.” (You would have agreed to pre-
marriage counseling and a longer time for living separate and apart. You would have also 
completed a “Declaration of Intent” and filed it with your marriage certificate.) 

BEFORE YOU START 

Please note that these forms are for an uncontested divorce only. The forms do not address spousal 
support, child support, domestic abuse, or community property. You may need to address these 
issues using  separate forms or by  finding a lawyer  to  represent you.  You should consult a 
lawyer before using these forms if domestic violence or interim spousal support relief are essential 
to your case as the timing of a divorce may affect the relief obtained. 

ou will be filing your divorce as a “self-represented litigant.” That means you are moving your 
case forward without a lawyer. As the person suing for divorce, you are the “Petitioner” and your 
spouse is the “Defendant.” All the forms you need to file for a divorce are attached or referenced 
in  these  instructions.  The  forms  assume  that  your  spouse  will  not  challenge  or  respond  to  the 
divorce. 

o learn more about the divorce process, visit LouisianaLegalNavigator.org or 

LouisianaLawHelp.org. To find help, visit bit.ly/legal-referrals or 
http://www.LSBA.org/goto/FindLegalHelp. 
 

HOW TO COMPLETE THE FORMS 
Read instructions all the way through before starting. 

Decide in which court you must file your case. If you file your case in the wrong court, 
you might lose your filing fees. If the case accidentally goes forward in the wrong parish, 
your divorce will not be valid, and you will not be legally divorced. You can only file your 
divorce case in: 

•  The parish you are currently “domiciled” in (which means where you live and is 

your permanent/legal home); OR 

•  The parish your spouse is domiciled in; OR  
•  The parish where you and your spouse last lived together as a married couple.  

 

Most people file their divorce where they are currently domiciled. 

Consider how you will serve your divorce on your spouse. If you and your spouse agree 
about getting a divorce and are willing to speak about the process, you can ask your spouse 
to “waive” service of process and other legal delays. This will make the process go faster. 
Your spouse will just need to sign a waiver form before a notary. If your spouse will not 
waive service and they live in Louisiana, you must ask the court to have the Sheriff serve 
him/her at home or work. If your spouse will not waive service and they live in another 
state, you will have to use the “Long Arm” process to serve your spouse (more instructions 
below).

Form provided as a courtesy the Louisiana Access to Justice Commission. No enrollment of counsel is expressed or implied. Every factual 
situation is different, and all litigants are encouraged to explore options for representation at www.LSBA.org/goto/FindLegalHelp. 

Revised April 2022Figure out your case “filing fees.” To do that, call the Clerk at the Court you decided to 
file your case in and ask about the costs to file for divorce. If you can pay the court fees, 
get your payment ready – a money order or debit/credit card is best. If you cannot afford 
to  pay  the  court  fees,  you  can  fill  out  an  “IN  FORMA  PAUPERIS  AFFIDAVIT”  or 
“IFP” (bit.ly/in-forma-pauperis). The IFP asks the court to delay (but not eliminate) the 
cost of filing. You may still have to pay fees at the end of the case. The court could also 
order your spouse to pay them, or the two of you to split the costs, but you must ask for 
the payment arrangement you want in your petition. If required, fill out the IFP but do not 
sign it yet. 

Get your petition ready to file. Fill in the top part (called the “caption”) and all blanks 
on the pages marked “(1a - PETITION)” and “(1b – VERIFICATION),” but do not sign 
yet. Find a notary (bit.ly/la-notaries), ask about their fees, and schedule an appointment. 
Bring your Photo ID and your original, unsigned documents to your appointment. If you 
are filing the “IFP,” bring an adult witness that can speak to your financial situation to 
your appointment as well. Sign the VERIFICATION (and IFP, if required) in front of the 
notary. Make at least one (1) copy of your completed PETITION.  

File  your  petition  with  the  court.  Take  your  filing  fees  or  IFP,  your  copy  of  the 
PETITION, and all of the original pages marked with “1a” and “1b” at the bottom to the 
Clerk of Court’s Office where you will file your case. Go to the Civil Department and tell 
the staff that you do not have a lawyer, and that you want to file your divorce. Ask the 
Clerk of Court to stamp a date AND write the docket number of your case on your copy 
of the PETITION. You will need your docket number and the date you filed your petition 
for other documents you file in your case. Keep your copy of the Petition for Divorce in a 
safe place.  

If your spouse is willing to waive service of process, ask the Clerk of Court’s office for 
a “certified copy” of your Petition when you file.  Hand or mail your spouse the certified 
copy of your divorce, along with the “Sworn Affidavit of Waiver of Service and Process,” 
which is marked “(2a – WAIVER).”  They will need to find a notary and sign the WAIVER 
in the notary’s presence, then get the waiver back to you or file it directly with the Clerk 
of Court. If your spouse doesn’t file it for you, you must file the WAIVER in your case 
with the Clerk of Court. After the WAIVER is filed, you then must wait two days (not 
counting holidays or weekends) before moving on to Step 7 below. 

If  regular  service  is  required  on  your  spouse  and  they  live  in  Louisiana,  you  will 
provide  information  about  how  to  serve  them  at  the  end  of  the  PETITION.  About  1-2 
weeks after you have filed your case, call the Clerk of Court’s office to check to see if your 
spouse has been “served” by the Sheriff. Once the Clerk of Court’s office tells you that 
your spouse has been served, you must wait at least twenty-one (21) days from the date 
your spouse was served before moving on to Step 7 below.  

If regular service is required on your spouse and your spouse lives in another state, 
ask the Clerk of Court for a “certified copy” of your Petition and a “Citation for Long Arm 
Service” when you file. Have the certified copy of the Petition delivered to your out-of-
state  spouse  at  their  physical  address  either  by  USPS  certified  mail  or  a  commercial 
delivery service (like FedEx or UPS). You must have a return receipt or proof of delivery 
to submit to the court. Once you receive the return receipt or proof of delivery, fill out the 
AFFIDAVIT  OF  LONG ARM SERVICE,  which is marked “(2b – LONG ARM)” and 
sign it in front of a notary. Then, you may file that document and your proof of delivery in 
your case with the Clerk of Court. You must then wait thirty (30) days from the date you 
filed the AFFIDAVIT OF LONG ARM SERVICE before moving on to Step 7 below. 

Call the Clerk of Court to check the status of your case. Make sure your spouse has not 
filed an “Answer” or other pleading. If your spouse has filed an “Answer” to the lawsuit, 
check with the court to see if any hearings have been scheduled. When you call, ask the 
Clerk of Court whether you are required to file the form titled “APPENDIX 28.1B: LA. 
C.C.P. ART. 1702(F1) DIVORCE CHECKLIST.” Also ask the Clerk of Court if the 
assigned judge requires in-court testimony and not Affidavits of Correctness.

Revised April 2022Finalize your divorce paperwork. If nothing has been filed by your spouse, the next step 
is to complete the form marked “(3-AFFIDAVIT OF CORRECTNESS)” and sign it in the 
presence of a notary! If the Clerk of Court told you that you do not have to fill out the 
“Appendix  28.1B  Divorce  Checklist”  mentioned  above,  make  sure  you  fill  out  the 
“Petitioner’s Certification”  on the page marked  “(4-DEFAULT JUDGMENT).”  For the 
“Petitioner’s Certification” you will need to know the date of service and whether it was 
domiciliary or personal service. 

File for your Judgment of Divorce. Bring a copy and the original of: the AFFIDAVIT 
OF CORRECTNESS (marked “(3-AFFIDAVIT OF CORRECTNESS)”), the DEFAULT 
JUDGMENT  OF  103(1)  DIVORCE  with  MINOR  CHILDREN  (marked  “(3-
DEFAULT)”),  and  the  completed  Appendix  28.1B  DIVORCE  CHECKLIST  (if 
necessary) to the Clerk of Court’s office. Ask the Clerk of Court to have a Judge sign them. 

ou  are  considered  legally  divorced  as  of  the  date  your  Judge  has  signed  your  DEFAULT 
JUDGMENT OF 103(1) DIVORCE with MINOR CHILDREN. If you were granted “In Forma 
Pauperis” status, the court should send you a certified copy of your Default Judgment of Divorce. 
If not, you can request one for a fee. Keep this certified copy for your records.
