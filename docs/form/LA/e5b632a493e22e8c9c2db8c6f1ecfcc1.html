      <pre>SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT 
 
PETITION TO CHANGE NAME 

his  form  is  intended  for  individuals  seeking  to  legally  change 

their first and/or last name who: 
 Are 18 years or older 

HOW TO COMPLETE THESE FORMS: 
Read instructions all the way through before starting. 

.   Decide where you will file your case. If you file your Petition for Name Change in 
the wrong court, the court might reject your case and you might lose your filing fees. 
You can file this case in:  

  The parish you were born in; OR 

  The parish where you currently live; OR 

  At the Vital Records Registry in Orleans Parish. 

The parish you choose will be written at the top of each document you fill out 
(more instructions later). 

.  Complete  the  Form.  Fill  in  the  blanks  with  100%  accurate  information.  Any  false 
statement made under oath contained in the foregoing petition may constitute perjury. 
Provide  the  name  of  your  parish,  the  district  court  number,  and  the  name  of  the 
district attorney. There are two (2) parts to the document, one is the “Petition” form 
and  the  other  is  the  “Judgment”  form.  You  will  want  to  make  three  copies  of  each 
document. Read it completely and make sure it is correct. DO NOT SIGN yet. 
NOTE:  In  some  parishes,  residents  must  also  complete  this  form  and  have  it 
notarized). You may want to contact the Clerk of Court in the parish you are filing to 
see if they require it to be notarized. It is generally recommended to have your form 
notarized  in  name  change  instances.  If  obtaining  a  notary,  you  must  sign  the 
document in front of the notary.  

.  Figure out your case “filing fees.” Call the Clerk of Court of the parish where you 
plan  to  file  your  case  and  ask  about  the  costs  to  file  for  name  change  and  ask  how 
they accept payment – check, money order, credit card, etc. Get your payment ready. 
When you go to file, they clerk may ask for your social security number, so have that 
ready.  
 

4.  File your petition. The Clerk of Court will ask you to identify yourself with ID and 

pay the required fee before affixing their stamp to the three (3) copies of their Petition 
for Name Change. The clerk will keep one (1) copy, and the individual will take the 
other two (2). You will receive a file and case number.  

.  Submit a copy of the petition to the District Attorney. When you file your petition 
with  the  court,  you  will  also  deliver  a  copy  of  the  petition  to  the  District  Attorney 
(DA)  in  the  parish  where  you  filed.  You  can  choose  to  deliver  or  serve  the  DA  by 
going to the DA's office in person or you can choose to serve the DA through regular 
service  of  process.  The  DA’s  office  is  usually  in  the  same  building  as  the  Clerk  of 
Court in the courthouse. When you arrive, the DA will ask for a copy of your driver’s 
license or ID. Ask the DA how long it will take for them to prepare their answer to 
your petition. If they don’t know, make sure they have your contact information. The 
DA’s  office  will  let  you  know  when  they  prepare  and  file  their  answer  to  your 
petition with the Court. Sometimes they forget, so be sure to call them after about a 
week to get an update.

or implied. Every factual situation is different, and all litigants are encouraged to explore options for 
representation at www.LSBA.org/goto/FindLegalHelp. 
Revised November 2022 

6.  Wait for activity or communication about your petition. If necessary, periodically 
contact the District Attorney's Office and check in to see if there has been any activity 
on your case. There may be some time between when your District Attorney receives 
your  petition  and  when  the  District  Attorney  files  a  response.  In  rare  cases  where 
there is a hearing including court appearance(s), you should find an attorney for more 
legal advice. While an attorney is not needed to obtain an expungement, the help of a 
lawyer or someone who has experience guiding the process is recommended. Talk to 
a lawyer for individual legal advice. 
 

7.  Judge  makes  a  decision  regarding  the  petition.  When  the  DA  receives  a  copy  of 
your name change petition, they will run a background check. The DA will also then 
file  an  answer  to  your  petition.  There  may  be  some  time  between  when  the  DA 
receives your name change documents and the DA files an answer. If the DA objects, 
contact an attorney. After the DA files an answer to the court, the judge assigned to 
your  case  will  make  the  final  decision.  If  you  need  to  attend  a  hearing  before  the 
judge makes a final decision you will told in advance by the Clerk of Court. Once the 
judge reaches a decision you can have your "Judgment" form stamped by the Clerk of 
Court. You will next take the stamped "Judgment" form to the judge to sign. You can 
either wait to have the judge sign the form while you are at the court. You can have it 
sent  from  the  Clerk  of  Court's  office.  You  can  request  more  copies  of  your  official 
name change court papers from the Clerk of Court at any time.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
