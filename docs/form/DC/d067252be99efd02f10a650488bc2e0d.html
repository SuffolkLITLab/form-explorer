      <pre>   SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA   
 SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO CONSERVATORS   

  

     
Upon  appointment,  a  conservator,  limited  or  general,  shall  act  as  a  fiduciary  and
observe the standards of care applicable to trustees.  Specifically the conservator shall
do the following:   
  
(1)  Upon  appointment,  the  conservator  shall  qualify  by  filing  bond  (if  the  Court 
requires  bond)  and  by  filing  an  Acceptance  and  Consent  to  Jurisdiction  unless  the 
conservator  has  signed  the  acceptance  and  consent  at  the  end  of  the  Petition  for  a 
General Proceeding.  These filings must occur within fourteen (14) days of the date of 
appointment.  

 

   
 

 

   
 

(2)  The  conservator  shall  develop  an  individual  conservatorship  plan  in  consultation
with  the  guardian  (if  any)  and,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  the  ward  in
accordance with the provisions of D.C. Code, §21-2065(b).  The conservatorship plan 
must be filed within sixty days of the date of the appointment of the conservator.  

(3) Implicit in the duties of a conservator charged with the responsibility of expending
funds  for  the  care  and  maintenance  of  a  ward  is  the  need  to  become  or  remain
personally  acquainted  with  the  ward  and  to  maintain  sufficient  contact  to  know  the
ward’s capacities, limitations, and needs. This is especially true when no guardian has
been  appointed.   To  ensure awareness  at  all  times  of  the  incapacitated  ward’s needs
and condition, it is recommended that the conservator visit the ward.  The conservator
shall file a change of address promptly if either the ward or the conservator moves.  

  
(4) If there are sufficient funds, the conservator shall ensure that money is available
each month for the personal use or incidental needs of the ward. If the ward lives in a 
nursing home, the conservator may consider contacting the appropriate nursing home
officials  to  establish  and  fund  a  ‘patient’s  account’  with  the  home  to  be  used  for  the
monthly purchase of incidental needs of the ward.  If the ward is a Medicaid recipient, 
the conservator shall use such amounts as are allowed by Medicaid regulations for the
personal use or incidental needs of the ward.   
  
(5) The conservator shall ensure that funds for the care, support, and maintenance of
the ward are paid to the nursing home or other authorized caretaker promptly as due. 

6)  Whenever  it  appears  to  the  conservator  that  the  financial  resources  of  the  ward
are  being  depleted  and  that  the  protected  individual  will  soon  become  eligible  for
Medicaid  benefits,  the  conservator  shall  make  timely  application  for  said  benefits  to
ensure uninterrupted funding for the protected individual’s care and maintenance.   
  
(7)  If  the  conservator  has  reason  to  believe  that  the  ward  is  in  need  of  protective
services because of abuse or neglect by another, the conservator shall immediately
report this belief to Adult Protective Services either orally or in writing.  The report
shall include the name, age, physical description, and location of the adult alleged to
be  in  need  of  protective  services;  the  name  and  location  of  the  person  allegedly
responsible  for  the  abuse,  neglect,  or  exploitation;  the  nature  and  extent  of  the
abuse, neglect, or exploitation; the basis of the reporter’s knowledge; and any other
relevant information.  D.C. Code, sec. 7-1903.  Any person required to report who  

  (

wilfully fails to do so shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, subject
to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $300.00.    D.C.  Code,  sec.  7-1912.    For  additional 
at

The above instructions are for guidance only and do not include all the conservator’s 
duties and responsibilities.  Individuals serving as conservators shall be governed by
all  applicable  statutory  provisions,  rules  of  Court  and  Court  orders  issued  regarding
their wards.

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA   
  
CONSERVATORSHIP INFORMATION SHEET   
  

The  following  information  is  provided  to  those  individuals  appointed  as  limited  or
general conservator of an incapacitated individual (ward) but is not intended to be all-
inclusive.    Individuals  appointed  as  conservators  shall  be  governed  by  all  applicable
statutory provisions, rules of court, and Court orders regarding their wards.  

  
1.  PERMANENT GENERAL CONSERVATOR   
A  permanent  general  conservator  is  one  appointed  by  the  Court  and  on  whom  the
Court has conferred, without limitation, title to all property of the protected individual 
(ward) and those powers enumerated in D.C. Code,  sec. 21-2070 and  sec. 21-2071 
(2001 ed.).  
  
2.  PERMANENT LIMITED CONSERVATOR   
The  Court  establishes  a  limited  conservatorship  (1)  by  entry  of  an  order  specifying
that only a part of the property of the ward vests in the conservator or (2) by limiting
the powers conferred under D.C. Code,  sec. 21-2070 or  sec. 21-2071 either at the 
time of appointment or later.  
  
3.  SPECIAL CONSERVATOR OR TEMPORARY CONSERVATOR  
The Court may appoint a special conservator to discharge specific arrangements or 
transactions ordered by the Court (D.C. Code,  sec. 21-2056(c)) or a temporary 
conservator (D.C. Code,  sec. 21-2062).  
  
4.  TITLE BY APPOINTMENT   
The  appointment  of  a  conservator  vests  in  the  conservator  title  as  trustee  to  all
property  of  the  ward  presently  held  or  after  acquired  or  to  the  property  specified  in
the  court  order,  including  title  to  any  property  held  for  the  ward  by  custodians  or
attorneys in fact.   
  
5.  QUALIFICATION   
limited  or  general  conservator  qualifies  by  executing  an  Acceptance  of 
A 
Guardian/Conservator  form  (unless  the  conservator  signed  the  acceptance  at  the  end
of the Petition for a General Proceeding).  If bond is required by order of the Court, the 
conservator  must  also  execute  and  file  a  bond  in  the  amount  set  by  the  Court  to
qualify.  These filings must occur within fourteen (14) days of the date of appointment. 

  
6.  APPRAISAL   
A  limited  or  general  conservator  shall  promptly  engage  the  services  of  a  qualified 
appraiser  if  the  value  of  the  ward’s  personal  property  exceeds  $1,000.00.    This
appraisal is filed as part of the Inventory (see item 12).  If the value is estimated as
being  less  than  $1,000.00,  the  conservator  shall  file  an  affidavit  setting  forth  the 
description  and  the  value  of  the  tangible  personal  property  as  part  of  the  Inventory
(see  item  12).    The  Court  has  an  appraiser  on  staff  that  can  be  used  without  cost  if
available.  
  
  

July 2012 – 947.10.v3 
 

7.  RECORDING LETTERS OF CONSERVATORSHIP   
(a) Letters of conservatorship are evidence of the transfer of all assets (or the part of
assets  specified  in  the  Letters)  of  a  ward  to  the  conservator.  An  order  terminating  a

from  the  conservator  to  the  protected  individual  or  to  the  personal  representative  of
the individual.   
(b)  Letters  of  conservatorship  and  orders  terminating  conservatorships  shall  be  filed
or recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds so that notice of the transfer of title 
is on file.  The Recorder of Deeds is located at 1101 4th Street, S.W., Washington, DC, 
telephone number 202-727-5374.  
  
8.  GENERAL DUTY OF CONSERVATOR

conferred  are  subject  to  any  limitations  that  the  Court  may  impose  at  the  time  of
appointment or at a later date.   
  
10.  DISTRIBUTIVE DUTIES AND POWERS
