NOTICE TO ARRESTED PERSONS 
Please review the information below that explains your release and your duty to comply. The information below is subject to change without advance notice.  

 

CITATION RELEASE 

If you are eligible, you may be released immediately on your 
promise  to go to D.C. Superior Court, 500 Indiana Ave., NW, 
Washington, D.C. on the date and time on the Citation Release 
section on Page 1 of this document.  

 prosecutor will decide whether to file a criminal case against 
you. If you do not  appear in Court , a bench warrant may be is-
sued for your arrest. In addition, you could be charged with failing 
to appear even if the prosecutor decides to drop the case.  

s a condition of your release on citation, you may be directed to 

stay away from and have no contact with a particular person or 
persons and/or to stay away from a particular place until you 
appear in Court.  

If you violate the stay away, a police officer can immediately 
arrest you, and you will be brought to Court on the next day that 
the Court is open. If the prosecutor charges you with any crime, 
you will have a right to be represented by an attorney. If you can-
not afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
Even though you were arrested, the government may decide not 
to file charges against you  in Court. It is important that you bring 
the citation release form with you to Court on your arraignment 
date because it contains information that you may need to iden-
tify whether or not  the government has filed charges in Court.  

FOR CASE INFORMATION 

For information on the status of your case, you may call the D.C. 
Superior Court’s Criminal Division Customer Service line at  
(202) 879-1373. 

You have been arrested on a bench warrant. You may post a bond in the amount set by the judge who issued the warrant. If you pay the 
bond, you will be released to appear in Court on the date and time indicated on Page 1 of this document. If you do not appear on that date 
and time, a new bench warrant could be issued for your arrest. You could be charged with failure to appear even if the prosecutor 
decides to drop this case. Failure to appear for the Court date also could lead to the loss of the bond you have paid.   

BOND RELEASE  

POST AND FORFEIT MONEY 

If you have been charged with an eligible offense and you are eligible to post and forfeit, you may pay the amount of money set by the 
Court for the offense and the case will end. If you choose to pay the amount set, you will NOT get your money back because you are 
agreeing to forfeit the amount. No sanction, penalty, enhanced sentence, or civil disability will be imposed by any District of Columbia 
court or agency  in any subsequent criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding or action if you post and forfeit. You WILL have an arrest 
record. You may file a motion with the Superior Court to seal your arrest record. For more information regarding sealing your record, 
you can contact the Public Defender Service of the District of Columbia at 202-628-1200 or via email at www.pds.dc.org.  
 

 WHAT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AND DECIDE TO CONTEST THE CHARGES? If you decide you would rather appear in Court after you post 
the money, you can file a “Motion to Set Aside Forfeiture” within 90 days of today’s date.  

  WHAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO OPPOSE YOUR POST AND FORFEIT DECISION? The Office of the Attorney General for the District of 

Columbia, the prosecutor for this case,  may file a “Motion to Set Aside Forfeiture” within 90 days.  

  WHAT HAPPENS IF THE COURT GRANTS  THE MOTION? If your motion or the government’s motion is granted, the charges be reinstated  

and you will have to go to Court. If you cannot afford an attorney, you may be eligible for appointed counsel.   

If you choose not to post and forfeit and elect to continue the criminal case, you are eligible for release on citation. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ARRESTED PERSONS REGARDING TRAFFIC  OFFENSES

case early if you bring the following documents to your Court date:

of-state permit AND a 15-year driving record.

port obligations, and that you have paid any reinstatement fees. The document also must indicate that your license has been 
reinstated and that you are in good standing.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
