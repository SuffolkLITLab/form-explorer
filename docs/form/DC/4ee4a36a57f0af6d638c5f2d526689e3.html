MEDIATION AND NEUTRAL CASE EVALUATION PROCEDURES 
AND 
CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT STATEMENT 

Extensive experience throughout the country has shown that a high percentage of civil cases 
referred for mediation or neutral case evaluation are amicably settled without the need for an 
expensive and time-consuming trial. The likelihood of settlement is enhanced when all parties 
to the lawsuit meet face-to-face for discussions in the presence of a neutral party. This is true 
even where an insurance company is involved. The Court has therefore instituted the following 
procedures for all cases ordered to participate in mediation or neutral case evaluation. Parties and 
counsel are cautioned that sanctions may be imposed on those who do not comply. 

I 
SCHEDULING AND ATTENDANCE 

1. All parties and their attorneys must appear at the mediation or case evaluation conference set by
the Multi-Door Dispute Resolution Division in accordance with the Scheduling Order entered in the
case. See attached filing instructions on the procedure for filing Confidential Settlement Statements
and for rescheduling mediations. Parties not represented by counsel need not secure an attorney for
the mediation or neutral case evaluation conference. You may contact the Multi-Door Dispute
Resolution Division at 202-879-1549 with questions regarding the mediation, case evaluation
conference, or the Confidential Settlement Statement.

2. Any party or attorney who believes that he or she has been incorrectly notified to appear for
mediation or case evaluation must contact the Quality Review Branch at 202-879-1750 and provide
the appropriate documentation. Where no such action is taken, the party or counsel will be required
to participate fully in the mediation or case evaluation.

3. Corporations, partnerships and other business entities must bring an officer, partner or other
individual with settlement authority to the mediation or case evaluation conference, unless
previously excused by the Judge. WMATA, the District of Columbia and other government entities
are required to send a representative whose authority may be needed to settle the case unless
excused by the Court for good cause shown.

4. If authorized by Court order, an insurance representative with full settlement authority may attend
the conference in place of the insured party.

5. An insurance representative whose authority may be needed to settle the case is required to attend
the mediation unless excused by the Court for good cause shown. (See Super. Ct. Civ. R. 16j.)

6. A party or an insurance representative residing outside the local metropolitan area who has been
excused from attending by Court order must be available by long-distance collect telephone call
throughout the entire mediation session. Counsel must advise the Multi-Door Division prior to the
mediation or case evaluation conference of any such arrangement and provide the name of the
individual party who will be available by telephone. (See Super. Ct. Civ. R. 16j.)

II 
CONFERENCE PROCEDURES 

1. Prior to the conference, each party must complete the attached "Confidential Settlement
Statement" and file it or the digital version* with the Multi-Door Dispute Resolution Division, 410
E Street, N.W., Suite 2900, Washington, D.C. 20001; or by email to: CivilCSS@dcsc.gov, by the
"CSS Return" date indicated on the scheduling notice. Do not send copies of the Confidential
Settlement Statement to the clerk, assigned judge, or other counsel/parties.

2. A party who fails to file the Statement on time may be ordered to appear before the presiding
judge and show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. Counsel may file one settlement
statement for all the parties he or she represents, provided that all those parties are clearly and
expressly indicated on the statement.

3. If the case settles prior to the conference, the original and one copy of the praecipe or document
disposing of the case must be filed with the clerk's office. A copy must also be sent to the Multi-
Door Dispute Resolution Division in lieu of a Confidential Settlement Statement. Counsel must be
certain to inform the Multi-Door Division of settlements occurring prior to the mediation or case
evaluation conference. If no praecipe or document disposing of the case is filed, the mediation shall
go forward.

4. Both mediation and neutral case evaluation sessions are confidential. The participants will be
asked to sign an "Agreement to Mediate" at the beginning of the session confirming their
understanding of the session's confidential nature. All proceedings at the mediation or case
evaluation conference, including any statement made by any party, attorney or other participant, are
privileged. They may not be construed as an admission against interest and nothing said at such
sessions may be used in court in connection with the case or any other litigation. No party is bound
by anything said or done at the mediation or case evaluation conference unless a settlement is
reached and a settlement praecipe is filed with the Court.

5. Mediation. If the case is set for mediation, the mediator will meet initially with all the parties, the
insurance representative, or other government representative and counsel. He or she may then meet
with each side privately as necessary to clarify important issues and to allow parties to reveal in
confidence the factors viewed as critical to settlement. Through a series of meetings with the parties,
individually and together, the mediator will try to facilitate an agreement that will satisfy the interests
of all concerned.

6. Neutral Evaluation. If the case is set for neutral evaluation, counsel or pro se parties will be
expected to present a summary of the factual and legal arguments of their case. The evaluator will
help the parties identify the issues in dispute and provide a nonbinding opinion of the settlement
value of the case, including the likelihood of liability and the likely range of damages. The parties are
encouraged to continue settlement discussions with or without the evaluator's further assistance.

7. If the case is settled at the time of mediation or neutral case evaluation, a copy of the settlement
praecipe or other document memorializing the settlement must be filed promptly with the Multi-Door
Division case manager. If the parties need approval of the settlement by the Court, Multi-Door will
set a status hearing on the judges’ calendar. The parties are responsible for filing a motion for court
approval of the settlement. Please note that settlements involving minors require judicial approval.
See 21 D.C. Code § 120 (2001 ed.)

8. If the case does not settle, it will proceed to pretrial conference and trial as directed by the
governing scheduling order.

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
MULTI-DOOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION DIVISION 
Confidential Settlement Statement 
FILING INSTRUCTIONS 

The General Mediation and Case Evaluation Order requires each party to file a Confidential 

Settlement Statement (CSS) with the Multi-Door Dispute Resolution Division 14 days before the 

mediation for car accident cases placed on CA Track V1 Fast and CA Track V2 Fast and 30 days 

before the mediation date for all other cases. Parties and counsel are cautioned that Multi-Door will request 

that sanctions be imposed on those who do not file the statement timely. 

Delivery: Confidential Settlement Statements are accepted by e-mail at CivilCSS@dcsc.gov. You 

will receive a reply message as proof of filing. For recordkeeping purposes, CSS’s sent after 5:00 pm.

filing box for CSS forms. Do not deliver CSS forms to the Civil Division or any after-hours filing box.

Proper filing with the Multi-Door Division will ensure that the CSS remains confidential and is not

assigned to the case. For additional filing information please call our office at 202-879-1549.

information that may be helpful to the mediator.

Office, 500 Indiana Avenue N.W., Suite 5000, Washington, D.C.  20001 with a copy sent to the

Multi-Door Dispute Resolution Division, in lieu of the statement.

rescheduling mediation, before the CSS return date (30 days before mediation), may be granted by

contacting the Quality Review Office at 879-1751. All requests to continue thereafter must be

submitted to the assigned judge through a motion. Any request to continue a CAV case goes to the
