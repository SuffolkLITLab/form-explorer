      <pre>SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO GUARDIANS  
 
Unless the appointment is made to accomplish one specific purpose, both limited and general 
guardians shall become (or remain) personally acquainted with the ward and maintain contact 
with  the  ward  so  that  the  guardian  knows  the  ward’s  capacities,  limitations,  needs, 
opportunities,  and  physical  and  mental  health.    Developing  such  a  relationship  allows  the 
guardian to exercise the powers listed in D.C. Code, sec. 21-2047 for the benefit of the ward 
and to comply with the reporting requirements of that Code section.  Specifically, the guardian 
should do the following:  

1) Upon appointment, the guardian shall qualify by filing an Acceptance and Consent to 
Jurisdiction (unless the guardian has signed the acceptance and consent at the end of the 
Petition for General Proceeding) and a bond (if the Court requires a bond).  These filings must 
occur within fourteen (14) days of the date of appointment. 

2)  For INT cases only, the guardian shall develop a guardianship plan in consultation with the 
ward.  That plan must be filed within ninety days of the date of appointment. 

3) The guardian shall file a change of address promptly if either the ward or the guardian 
moves. 

4)  If the ward has money subject to the control of the guardian, the guardian shall ensure 
that money is available each month for the personal use or incidental needs of the ward.  If 
the ward lives in a nursing home, the guardian may consider contacting the appropriate 
nursing home officials to establish and fund a “patient’s account” with the home to be used for 
the monthly purchase of incidental needs of the ward. If the ward is a Medicaid recipient, the 
guardian shall use such amounts as are allowed by Medicaid regulations for the personal use 
or incidental needs of the ward.  

5) If no conservator has been appointed and the guardian is charged with the responsibility of 
expending funds for the care and maintenance of the ward, the guardian shall ensure that 
monies available for the care and maintenance of the ward are paid to the nursing home or 
other authorized caretaker promptly as due. 

6) The guardian shall become and remain informed of the ward’s medical needs and desires 
and shall maintain sufficient contact with the ward’s medical personnel and caretakers to 
ensure that the medical needs of the ward are satisfied fully and promptly.  The guardian 
shall personally visit the ward at least once every thirty (30) days.  The guardian shall 
seek appropriate order of the Court before consenting to any medical procedures prohibited by 
D.C. Code, sec. 21-2047(c) unless the authority to consent is granted in the order of 
appointment.  

7) If the guardian has reason to believe that the ward is in need of protective services 
because of abuse or neglect by another, the guardian shall immediately report this belief to 
Adult Protective Services either orally or in writing.  The report shall include the name, age, 
physical description, and location of the adult alleged to be in need of protective services; the 
name and location of the person allegedly responsible for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation; 
the nature and extent of the abuse, neglect, or exploitation; the basis of the reporter’s 
knowledge; and any other relevant information.  D.C. Code, sec. 7-1903.  Any person required 
to report who willfully fails to do so shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, 
subject to a fine not exceeding $300.00.  D.C. Code, sec. 7-1912.  For additional information, 
see the Adult Protective Service website at http://dhs.dc.gov/dhs/csp/view,a,3,q,492691.asp. 

he above instructions are for guidance only and do not include all the guardian’s duties and 
responsibilities.  Individuals  serving  as  guardians  must  comply  with  all  applicable  statutory 
provisions, rules of Court, and Court orders issued regarding their wards.

statutory provisions, rules of Court, and Court orders issued regarding their wards. 

.  PERMANENT GENERAL GUARDIAN  

A permanent general guardian is one appointed by the Court and on whom the Court 
has  conferred,  without  limitation,  those  general  powers  set  forth  in D.C. Code, sec. 
21-2047(a) & (b) (2001 ed.).  

.  PERMANENT LIMITED GUARDIAN  

D.C. Code, sec. 21-2044(c) reads as follows:  
“The  court,  at  the  time  of  appointment,  later  on  its  own  motion,  or  on  appropriate 
petition  or  motion  of  the  incapacitated  individual  or  other  interested  person,  may 
limit  the  powers  of  a  guardian  otherwise  conferred  by  this  chapter  and  create  a 
limited  guardianship.    Any  limitation  on  the  statutory  power  of  a  guardian  of  an 
incapacitated  individual  shall  be  endorsed  on  the  guardian’s  letters.  Following  the 
same  procedure,  a  limitation  may  be  removed  or  modified  and  appropriate  letters 
issued.” 
  
3.  QUALIFICATION  
A  guardian  qualifies  by  executing  and  filing  an  Acceptance  of  Guardian/Conservator

General Proceeding).  If bond is required by order of Court, the guardian must also 
execute and file a bond in the amount set by the Court to qualify.  These filings must 
occur within fourteen (14) days of the date of appointment.

that the guardian knows the ward’s capacities, limitations, needs, opportunities, and 
physical  and  mental  health.    The  guardian  shall  visit  the  ward  at  least  once 
every thirty (30) days.  The guardian shall exercise only those powers under D.C. 
Code, sec. 21-2047(a), (b), and (c) set forth in the Court’s order of appointment or 
authorized by subsequent order of the Court.  The powers may be found in Title 21 
of the D.C. Code, Chapter 20 at www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/dcofficialcode. 

.  PETITIONS  

Application  to  the  court  for  an  order  after  appointment  shall  be  by  the  filing  of  a 
verified  Petition  Post  Appointment  that  includes  a  Notice  of  Hearing  on  Subsequent 
Petition  in  accordance  with  SCR-PD  311,  a  Notice  of  Right  to  Respond  and/or 
Request an Oral Hearing pursuant to SCR-PD 322, an order appointing counsel, and

is  being  requested  and  why  the  request  is  being  made  and  shall  include  such

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
