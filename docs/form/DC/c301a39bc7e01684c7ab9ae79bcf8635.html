MESSAGE FROM THE D.C. COURTS CIO 

 It’s my pleasure to share with you the D.C. Courts (the 
Courts) IT Strategic Plan, 2018 - 2022. While the Courts have a 
varied and wide-ranging responsibilities, its core mission is to 
protect rights and liberties, uphold and interpret the law, and 
resolve disputes, fairly and effectively in the District of 
Columbia. As the Courts’ operation relies heavily on technology, 
the Information Technology Division has an important and 
powerful role to support the Courts’ mission.  

The Courts are the judicial branch of the District of 

Columbia government, and are comprised of the Court of 
Appeals (DCCA), the highest court of the District; the Superior 
Court of the District of Columbia (DCSC), a trial court with general jurisdiction over virtually all local 
legal matters; and, the Court System, which provides administrative support functions for both courts. 
The IT Strategic Plan 2018-2022 represents a collaborative effort across the Courts, ensuring that IT 
initiatives and operations are closely aligned with the business goals and objectives and that the Plan 
serves as an enterprise roadmap for the organization.  

This Plan outlines how we will achieve our goals of using an engaged IT workforce to provide 

best in class technology platform, enhanced information security, innovative business process and 
case management system, access to information, decision-making support, and customer satisfaction.  

This Plan is the result of the extraordinary commitment and dedication of the IT team, and our 
partnership with operational and supporting divisions, and business units. Increasing collaboration with 
the user community and agency partners, and investment in our workforce are critical to the success of 
the Information Technology Division as we continue to look at opportunities to enhance efficiencies, 
and at the same time, increase our capabilities to transform and modernize the business of the Courts to 
help make it more accessible, more transparent, and more convenient for all users.

he Information Technology Division’s leadership and staff along with representatives from key 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
users including the Court of Appeals, the Superior Court, and the Court System met over the course of 
several days to develop the updated IT strategic plan. Discussions were robust and candid, and they 
resulted in the best thinking of the group about how to address the information technology needs of the 
Courts over the next five years. 

This planning process was run in parallel with the development of the Courts’ overall strategic 

plan for 2018-2022. The court-wide plan and the IT Strategic Plan are fully aligned. 

This updated IT Strategic Plan was developed by the Courts’ Information Technology Division. 

The most recent IT Strategic Plan 2013-2017 was reviewed; interviews were conducted with key 
stakeholders; and a series of half-day workshops were conducted with IT managers and selected 
stakeholder representatives. Key stakeholder interviews were conducted with the following people: 
Hon. Anna Blackburne-Rigsby, Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Hon. Robert Morin, Chief Judge of 
the Superior Court, Anne Wicks, Executive Officer, Dr. Cheryl Bailey, Deputy Executive Officer, Julio 
Castillo, Clerk of the Court of Appeals, and James McGinley, Clerk of the Superior Court.  

The planning process began with an environmental scan which considered the social, political, 

technological and economic environment in which this strategic plan would be implemented. This 
paralleled the process used for the Courts strategic planning process. 

Key environmental factors included the following: potential move towards budget reductions; 

change in courts leadership; acceleration of technological change generally and the pressing need for the 
Courts to keep pace with newer technologies; cyber security risks accelerating and becoming more 
widespread; data mining risks increasing as the public records of the courts move online; increasing 
demand and competition for highly qualified IT professionals in a shrinking workforce post baby 
boomer retirement; and changes in the conceptualization of work by newer generations in the workforce 
especially as to permanence with one organization, personal growth focus, and demand for flexible 
workplace schedules. 

While many of these environmental factors are not new, the importance of a comprehensive 

response is ever more important to the Courts’ ability to deliver on their mission effectively. 

Using the classic SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis method, 

the IT management team rigorously and candidly assessed the current state of IT within the Courts, 
addressing each of the IT strategic goals from the most recent plan: 

1.  Provide Customer Focused Service 
2.  Deliver Enterprise Business Solutions 
3.  Enhance Technological Capabilities 
4.  Ensure Information Security 

  T

5.  Attract, Recruit & Retain a Skilled Workforce 

iscussions in this process focused heavily on the need for a renewed and innovative focus on 
Strategic Goal #5: Attract, Recruit & Retain a Skilled Workforce. Many issues and opportunities were 
identified: 

•  Competition for skilled IT staff resources 
•  Need for managerial and technical career ladders to support professional growth and 

retention 

•  Need for succession planning, implicit knowledge transfer and reduction of reliance on 

contractors for key subject matter expertise 

•  Enhanced staff resources to manage operations, deliver development projects, and maintain 

•  Stronger governance support through the IT Steering Committee to establish IT policies and 

active security management 

procedures and to enforce the latter 

fter the discussions, the Information Technology Division revised their mission statement to 

provide a more inspiring, transformational mission statement. 

Future state descriptions included redevelopment of the strategic goals and more detailed 

development of outcome focused goals and objectives. Strategic goals, actions, and key results were 
developed from this work.

GOAL 1 – ENGAGED IT WORKFORCE 
he key to delivering successful IT services or solutions is having the right people for the job.  
The Information Technology Division staff must be technically proficient in administering technology, 
and empowered and encouraged to undertake continuing professional development within their career 
fields.  Employees’ involvement in IT processes and the Courts’ Core Values forums and focus groups is 
essential to employee engagement and the adoption of these values in the Information Technology 
Division.  To ensure the strength of its workforce, the Information Technology Division will take 
actionable steps to address: 

  T

•  Employee development, training and certification 
•  Employee engagement 
•  Succession planning  
•  Employee onboarding  

ction 1.1: Create Employee Development Plans and the Information Technology Division 

Training Plan 

In order to adequately manage the IT services within its portfolio, the Information Technology 

Division will develop a functional needs matrix to support technology infrastructure and aligning 
vendors ‘certification standards for those products.  The current IT environment is highly reliant upon 
contractors for subject matter expertise to maintain critical IT systems.  Each vendor product in our 
production environment should have at least one full time employee trained and certified to administer 
and maintain the product utilizing the vendors’ best practices framework. The Information Technology 
Division will strive to develop its own highly qualified staff by making use of industry recognized 
training and certification programs.  A comprehensive division-level training and budget plan will be 
developed to align the Information Technology Division technology roadmap and professional 
development opportunities.

ction 1.2: Improve Employee Engagement            

As we strive to live the values of excellence, accountability, respect, fairness, integrity and 

transparency, a member of each Information Technology Division branch will participate on the 
Information Technology Division Values Committee.  The focus of this initiative is to give everyone a 
voice and create a safe space to have necessary conversations.  Regular attendance and participation in 
committee meetings to discuss strategies aimed at improving employee satisfaction will allow staff to be 
involved in some of the decision making processes that directly affect them.    

Key results: 

By 2020, at least one person per branch will participate on the Values Committee. 

By 2021, an internal shadow program will be developed and adopted.  

By 2022, there will be a 5% increase in the Employee Viewpoint Survey response rate as well 

as a 5% increase in employee satisfaction or engagement. 

ction 1.3: Develop a Succession Plan 

Over 40% of Information Technology Division staff will be eligible for retirement within the 
next five years.  Continuity of operations from a human resource perspective is essential to maintain 
streamlined, mature processes.  To facilitate proper knowledge transfer for identified key technical as 
well as management positions, the Information Technology Division will develop a succession plan with 
the Human Resources Division. Non-managerial employees will also be given Contracting Officer’s 
Technical Representative (COTR) opportunities, encouraged to participate in the Management Training 
Program and invited to participate in Change Advisory Board meetings. 

Key results: 

By 2020, develop an Information Technology Division succession plan that includes 100% of 

management and key technical positions. 

ction 1.4: Reduce Employee Recruiting and Onboarding Time    

Efficient recruiting processes will enable the Information Technology Division to identify and 

hire top talent.  The Information Technology Division will collaborate with the Human Resources 
Division to enhance the IT staff recruitment process to fill IT positions.  Position descriptions will be 
updated and well detailed to ensure that qualified candidates are targeted, as a method to attract IT 
professionals with innovative skills.  The Information Technology Division seeks to standardize the 
onboarding process for its new hires and develop a comprehensive onboarding package to better

GOAL 2 – BEST IN CLASS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 

To promote operational effectiveness for the Courts, the Information Technology Division will 
enhance the capability of its information technology infrastructure by adopting Information Technology 
Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices, seeking innovative technology solutions, keeping abreast of 
new technology developments, and embracing and adopting new technologies. Advanced technologies 
including cloud computing, desktop and server virtualization, business-centric enterprise architecture, 
and network infrastructure enhancement will be implemented.  

The Court’s have significant requirements for the availability, compatibility, reliability, 
performance, and redundancy of information technology resources, given the demands on the Courts for 
accurate, up-to-date information in real-time to serve the public. The Information Technology Division 
will continue to implement a best in class technology platform to meet current and future business 
requirements.  

ction 2.1: Implement High Availability Solutions for Mission-Critical Information Systems 

The Courts operations are dependent on the availability and performance of their case 
management systems, email, and other mission-critical systems (also known as: Priority 1 systems). The 
Information Technology Division will meet the 99.9% systems uptime requirements by building in 
redundancy for technology solutions for the case management systems and their underlying databases, 
servers, and network components, and enhancing systems monitoring procedures. 

Key Results: 

By 2019, both case management systems for DCCA and DCSC will be operational at their 

alternate data centers or in the Cloud. 

By 2019, 100% of messaging services will be moved to the cloud. .  

By 2019, 100% of Office productivity services will utilize MS Office 2016.  

By 2019, the Courts website will be moved to the cloud.  

By 2022, archived data set will be moved from tape units to the cloud. 

By 2022, Mission-critical systems that can be monitored by Applications Programming 

Interfaces (APIs) /Windows Management Interfaces (WMIs) will be identified and configured for 
system alerts. 

Action 2.2: Develop Enterprise Architecture Standards and Strengthen IT Governance 

 

  A

 

Page 10 

 The enterprise architecture governance process is to provide the leadership and direction that 

 
can create alignment within the IT community, close the gaps in standards development and compliance, 
and encourage cross-agency collaboration and integration. Enterprise architecture regards the enterprise 
as a large and complex system. To manage the scale and complexity of this system, an architectural
framework provides tools and approaches that help IT architects abstract from the level of detail at 
which builders’ work, to bring enterprise design tasks into focus and produce valuable IT systems and 
services. The Information Technology Division will develop enterprise architecture standards that will 
be used for all Courts’ information systems and platforms. The Information Technology Division will 
continue to improve its information systems management processes based on ITIL best practices.  

 

Key Results: 

By 2019, the current enterprise architecture will be fully and accurately documented to enable 

IT staff to bring enterprise design tasks into focus and produce valuable IT systems and services. 

By 2019, 5% infrastructure investment savings will be realized by consolidating duplicated 

technology platforms and solutions for DCCA and DCSC. 

By 2019, 100% of unsupported hardware and software will be identified, and life cycle 

migration plans with budgetary requirements will be developed. 

By 2019, 100% of asset management for network-connected devices will be automated and 

integrated with the service management tool. 

By 2019, 100% of all client computer platforms will be on MS Windows 10 and all users will 

be using MS Office 2016.  

By 2020, 100% of desktop peripherals will be standardized. 

By 2022, 80% of end-user desktops will be virtualized (including DCCA). 

By 2022, 100% of servers that are compatible with the virtualization technology will be

IT disaster recovery control measures can be classified into the following three types: 

•  Preventive measures – Controls aimed at preventing an event from occurring. 
•  Detective measures – Controls aimed at detecting or discovering unwanted events. 
•  Corrective measures – Controls aimed at correcting or restoring the system after a disaster 

or an event. 

The Information Technology Division will continue to review and update the IT Disaster 
Recovery Plan and ensure that the Plan documents the three types of controls and that those controls are 
regularly exercised using "DR tests". 

Page 11 

By 2019, the IT Disaster Recovery Plan will be updated including all new services. 

By 2019 and thereafter, the IT Disaster Recovery Plan will be functionally tested at least

GOAL 3 – ENHANCED INFORMATION SECURITY 

Protection of IT assets is critical to the reliability of the Courts’ information systems and the 

integrity of the data within those systems. The Information Technology Division must develop a 
comprehensive Information Systems Security Plan and employ a robust risk management approach. 
This will include improved asset management, robust threat and vulnerability analysis, and the 
development of response and recovery plans and procedures. The Courts will enhance its security 
posture and meet legislative and regulatory requirements, and internal standards. 

ction 3.1: Develop and Implement an Information Systems Security Plan 

To enhance and strengthen the Courts’ information security program, the Information 
Technology Division will develop a new Information Systems Security Plan (ISSP).  This Plan is to 
assign development and management responsibilities for information security; provide for the 
confidentiality, integrity, reliability, and availability of information; develop risk management strategies 
to identify and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities to information assets; establish and maintain an 
incident response plan; maintain ongoing security awareness and training programs; and comply with 
legislative and regulatory requirements, and the Courts’ internal standards. 

Key results: 

By 2019, a comprehensive Information Systems Security Plan will be developed and adopted. 

By 2019, an effective annual IT security awareness program will be developed and implemented 

to train all Courts’ information systems users. 

ction 3.2: Prioritize Cyber Security Investments through a Risk-based Approach 

As cyber security risks increase in number and sophistication, the Courts must respond to 

 
incidents more efficiently, effectively, and identify potential risks and address them before they occur. 
Developing a robust risk-based approach to IT security needs is crucial in protecting the Courts’ 
information assets. Identifying and categorizing the Courts’ information assets will assist in prioritizing 
cyber security investments. 

By 2020, the Information Technology Division will work with the Courts’ information assets 

owner and the Chief Internal Auditor’s Office to identify and categorize all the Courts’ information 
assets and develop a robust risk-based approach to prioritize cyber-security investments.

By 2021, more secure and cost-effective firewall technologies will be implemented. 

ction 3.3: Effectively Prevent, Monitor, and Rapidly Respond to Emerging Threats and 

Vulnerabilities 

The Information Technology Division must develop and implement policies that outline rules of 
behavior, detail training requirements for personnel, and identify consequences and corrective actions to 
address non-compliance. The Information Technology Division will implement additional monitoring 
and scanning tools to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, and to effectively manage security 
risks. The Information Technology Division must also continue implementing appropriate security 
incident response procedures and update those procedures when necessary. The Information Technology 
Division must continue taking steps to analyze and address privacy risks at the earliest stages of the 
planning process, and must continue to manage information responsibly throughout the information life 
cycle. 

Key results:

By 2021, an internal/external security plan audit will be undertaken annually.  

By 2021, the frequency of network scans and vulnerability patching will be conducted on a 

By 2021, staff will be better equipped to handle scans, patches, and other compliance items. 

ction 3.4: Secure eCommerce Transactions by Complying with PCI-DSS  

The D.C. Code §11–1748 granted the Courts the authority to accept payment of fines, fees, 
escrow payments, restitutions, bonds, and other payments to the Courts through card payments and 
electronic transfer of funds. This change allows the Courts to prioritize payments and incorporate a 
custom solution within the Courts’ case management systems. 

Along with this change also comes additional compliance activities and requirements; 

specifically, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which is an information 
security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes. 

Key results: 

By 2019, PCI boundary is identified and secured. 

By 2019, PCI Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are implemented.

GOAL 4 – INNOVATIVE BUSINESS PROCESS & CASE 
MANAGEMENT 

New technologies will continue to transform how the Courts conduct business in the future. The 

 

Information Technology Division will play a major role in supporting this transformation. In the next 
five years, the Information Technology Division will implement more advanced electronic case 
management and case filing systems; electronic case searching and online secure case payment; 
interview-based document assembly systems for pro se litigants; a juvenile probation case management 
system; juror self-check in; and mobile applications that serve both the public as well as court 
employees. 

Action 4.1: Implement State-of-the-Art Superior Court Case Management and Case Filing 
Systems 

The Courts’ case management systems contain the critical case information, and therefore must 

be secure and accurate, even as the public increasingly expects to access such information via the 
internet. The Courts will continue to expand access to information and court services online as means of 
eliminating barriers to meaningful participation in the judicial process. Utilizing the current case 
management system, the number and types of case documents that are accessible online will increase, 
with personally identifiable information redacted to protect individual privacy.  In addition, evidence 
collected in digital media formats will be housed in the case management system.  Electronic filing 
capabilities will be expanded to other case types. In accordance with Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standards (PCI-DSS), online credit card payment processing will allow individuals to handle 
monetary transactions without having to visit the Courts.  And, ultimately, a new web based case 
management system will be implemented for DCSC that features an interface with the DCCA’s case 
management system.

Action 4.2: Automate Data Exchange with Partner Agencies 

The Criminal Division’s Special Proceedings Branch in DCSC maintains bench warrants and 

custody orders that are entered into both the DCSC’s case management system as well as Metropolitan 
Police Department’s (MPD) warrant system. The Temporary Protection Orders and Civil Protection 
Orders are also entered into both systems by the Domestic Violence Unit.  

Following the filing of a petition to initiate a Title IV-D child support/custody case, the Family 

Court Operations Division’s Child Support Branch enters case management data such as party, legal 
orders, future court hearings and other important milestones associated with the life cycle of the case 
into both the DCSC’s case management system as well as the Office of the Attorney General (OAG)’s 
case management system. 

 The creation of interfaces between the DCSC’s case management system and the partner 

agency’s case management system will eliminate the process of dual entry, which causes delays and 
provides greater risk for human error.   

Key Results: 

By 2019, the interface between the DCSC case management system and MPD's warrant system 

will be completed for the Criminal Division and the Domestic Violence Unit, which will eliminate the 
need for dual-entry. 

By 2019, the interface between the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council’s (CJCC) JUSTIS 

and DCSC’s case management system for juvenile case initiation will be completed. 

By 2020, the interface between the Office of the Attorney General Child Support Division and 

the Family Court Operations Child Support Branch for Title IV-D child support case initiation as well as 
post-case initiation filing updates will be completed. 

ction 4.3: Implement State-of-the-Art Juror Management Systems 

The Courts continually strive to enhance the experience for individuals who fulfill their civic 

duty by reporting to Superior Court for jury service. Furthering the Courts’ goals of eliminating barriers, 
decreasing wait times, and providing more robust online services, an increased effort will be made to 

  A

Page 16 

effectively manage jury operations by communicating with potential jurors to alert them whether they 
 
should report to court for jury duty and by streamlining the check-in process once they arrive.   

By 2019, a new Juror Management System will be fully operational and supported by the 

Information Technology Division.  

By 2019, bar code juror check-in capabilities will be available. 

ction 4.4: Implement Juvenile Probation Case Management System 

In concert with the Courts’ goal to provide innovative services for youth under probation 

supervision, the Information Technology Division will continue to enhance its newly implemented 
Juvenile Probation Case Management System (JPCMS). JPCMS is a web based case management 
system designed to support the mission of the Family Court Social Services Division.  Interfacing with 
partner agency databases for GPS monitoring and drug testing data and the existing case management 
system, JPCMS serves as a centralized information system providing increased information to address 
the evolving needs of probation officers. 

By 2019, case initiation, case maintenance capabilities, and GPS and PRISM integration will be 

available through the Juvenile Probation Case Management System (JPCMS). 

Action 4.5: Automate Business Processes to Ensure Efficiency 

In an effort to advance the Courts’ goal of decreasing wait times this ongoing business 
improvement initiative seeks to streamline the court participant’s check-in process.  The Information 
Technology Division uses industry recognized, agile and rapid applications development tools to satisfy 
the Courts’ business needs.  

Effective courtroom and case intake management requires that court personnel be aware that 
parties are present.  Party check-in systems have been developed to enhance courtroom and division’s 
intake operations, with more slated for future implementation. Additional features will be added to 
improve existing ones.  

Key Results: 

officers and staff will be collected.  

By 2019, requirements for improving case management, drafting, and tracking tools for judicial 

By 2020, stand-alone sign-in systems will be consolidated into a single, enterprise system.

By 2021, technology solutions will be implemented using industry recognized, agile and rapid 

 
applications development tools to satisfy current and future business requirements. 

 

Action 4.6: Implement Interactive Interview Document Assembly Solution 

Providing individuals who choose to represent themselves with easy-to-understand resources 

and access to information is critical to the Courts’ overall goals and mission. A dynamic interactive 
interview document assembly solution will enable pro se/self-represented litigants to answer a series of 
online questions written in plain language that will generate the appropriate forms necessary to file case 
documents with the Courts.  

The Information Technology Division will work with its stakeholders, the Courts’ Standing 

Committee on Fairness and Access, and the operating divisions of the DCCA and DCSC, in 
implementing this solution. 

Key Results: 

By 2019, the Interactive Interview Document Assembly Solution will be implemented and used 

by DCCA, and DCSC’s Domestic Violence and Family Court Operations Divisions.  

By 2020, the Interactive Interview Document Assembly Solution will be implemented and used 

by DCSC’s Probate and Civil Divisions.

GOAL 5 – ACCESS TO INFORMATION 

“Access to Justice for All” has always been a priority goal in the Courts’ Strategic Plans. The 

Courts have a responsibility to eliminate barriers to meaningful participation in the judicial process and 
to enhance access to court services. Such barriers may include a lack of legal representation, limited 
literacy or English language skills, limited financial resources, and physical or mental disability. The 
Information Technology Division will implement technologies to assist the Courts in achieving this goal 
as well as providing tools for the Courts’ personnel to efficiently and effectively render court services. 

ction 5.1: Enhance Remote Access and Wireless Network 

Simplified and secure remote access will allow judicial officers and other court personnel to 

access information resources from anywhere and at any time. Building a dedicated and secure wireless 
network to authenticate court issued mobile devices automatically will allow judicial officers and senior 
managers to easily navigate information resources inside the Courts' network from any building in the 
Courts’ campus. 

Key Results: 

By 2019, advanced mobile devices will be made available to judicial officers, judicial interns, 

and senior managers to access their virtual desktops from anywhere and at any time. 

By 2022, a dedicated and secured wireless network for all court issued mobile devices will be 

configured and deployed. 

ction 5.2: Enhance Telecommunication and Videoconferencing Technologies  

The Information Technology Division expanded the Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
technology to all the Courts’ premises in 2018. In the next few years, the Information Technology 
Division will focus on the configuration of unified communication and collaboration capabilities and the 
implementation of new videoconferencing technologies. In addition, the Information Technology 
Division will implement a cloud-based fax technology to completely eliminate the legacy telephony 
infrastructure.

By 2022, videoconferencing with Court Services & Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) 

will be implemented. 

By 2022, advanced videoconferencing technology will be used by all divisions and business 

units and will require minimal IT support. 

By 2022, all conference rooms will be equipped with videoconferencing capabilities. 

Action 5.3: Implement New Technologies for Data Display and Signage to All Courts Premises 

While case online access, eFiling, ePayment, and videoconferencing capabilities will reduce the 

need for the public to visit the Courts in-person, implementing new technologies for data display and 
digital signage will assist persons in navigating within the courthouse.  

Key Results: 

By 2022, new technologies for digital signage and operational data will be implemented and 

placed strategically in key areas of the courts on all Courts’ premises. 

Action 5.4: Preserve and Provide Access to Historical Case Information 

The Courts have some historical case information stored on paper or legacy media, yet many of 

those cases have retention regulatory requirements of at least 70 years. Additionally, some audio-
recorded case information is stored on legacy media. The Information Technology Division will 
implement new technologies to preserve this historical case information and provide easy access to them 
when needed. 

Key Results: 

By 2020, historical case files that have long retention requirements for both DCCA and DCSC 

will be digitized, indexed, and made available from either their management systems or a separate 
indexing and searching system. 

By 2022, historical audio case files that have long retention requirements for both DCCA and 

DCSC will be moved to the enterprise storage space. 

ction 5.5: Enhance D.C. Courts Website and Implement a D.C. Courts Mobile App

Enhancing public access to the Courts’ information resources will reduce the need for in-person 

 
visits to the courthouses. In the next few years, the Information Technology Division will continue to 
enhance the D.C. Courts website to provide more capabilities. Furthermore, the Information Technology 
Division will develop a D.C. Courts mobile app that will seamlessly connect and interact with legal 
professionals, media representatives, constituents, and the rest of the public. This mobile app will allow 
for faster and easier, but nevertheless secure and sustainable access to court information.

Data is at the heart of every organization and data analytics is an integral part of the informed 

 
GOAL 6 – DECISION-MAKING SUPPORT 
decision-making process for executives and senior management. The Courts have heavily invested in an 
enterprise data warehouse and business intelligence to enable the organization as a whole to better 
understand data and to identify and solve business problems. To support data analysis and the extraction 
of meaningful information, the Information Technology Division in collaboration with the Strategic 
Management Division will continue to enhance the enterprise data warehouse and implement new 
technologies and tools that can help support effective decision-making. 

ction 6.1: Provide Data Analytics and Reporting for Case Management Activities 

The Courts’ case management systems are the most critical for business operations. Data from 

these systems are used to report on key performance measures and caseload statistics. Having case data, 
along with annual and fiscal trends displayed on dashboards, is vital for decision makers. The 
Information Technology Division and the Strategic Management Division will continue to develop more 
dashboards for operating divisions and judicial chambers. Additionally, the Information Technology 
Division will implement technology and tools that provide and present near-real-time data accurately 
and efficiently, without impacting the end-user experience.    

Data analytics is at its best when end users are alerted or notified of critical data trends and 

patterns in an efficient and timely manner along with actionable intelligence capabilities. The 
Information Technology Division will implement standard alert capabilities to business and system 
users to support effective decision making. 

Key results: 

By 2019, dashboards for all operating divisions will be implemented.  

By 2019, near-real-time data warehouse replication will be implemented.  

By 2021, critical business process standard alerts will be available to system users. 

ction 6.2: Complete the Enterprise Data Warehouse with All Courts’ Information Sources 

The Courts need a completed enterprise data warehouse that contains not only case information 

but also financial, human resources (HR), and other information. When all data is integrated, it will 
provide more meaningful insights into business operations and actionable intelligence. The Information 
Technology Division in collaboration with the Strategic Management Division will continue to enhance

By 2019, IBC Human Resource Information System data will be included in the data 

By 2019, IBC Financial Management System data will be included in the data warehouse. 

By 2019, dashboards for Chief Judges, the Executive Officer, Deputy Executive Officer, and 

Clerks of the Courts, will be implemented. 

ction 6.3: Establish Data Governance and Data Quality Control Processes 

The Courts’ Business Intelligence (BI) comprises the strategies and technologies used by the 

organization for the data analysis of business information. BI technologies utilize a comprehensive data 
warehouse to provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. Data governance is 
the exercise of authority, control, and shared decision making (e.g. planning, monitoring, and 
enforcement) over the management of data assets. Data Quality is the degree to which data is accurate, 
complete, timely, and consistent with all requirements and business rules. The Information Technology 
Division in collaboration with the Strategic Management Division will establish and implement Data 
Governance and Quality Control guidelines and procedures. 

Key results: 

By 2019, guidelines for Data Governance and Data Quality Control process will be established. 

By 2020, compliance procedures will be implemented.

GOAL 7 – CUSTOMER SATISFACTION 

 

As a service oriented division within the Court System, customer satisfaction is of great 
importance to Information Technology Division’s internal and external customers.  Request fulfillment 
(software/hardware), issue resolution and new system implementation are among the areas that will 
utilize metrics to gauge customer satisfaction.  The analysis of data gathered following carefully crafted 
customer surveys will allow us to measure our effectiveness.  

ction 7.1:  Increase IT Service Desk Responsiveness 

The IT Service Desk is the front line of communication between the Information Technology 

Division and our customers.  With the recent implementation of a new customer service portal, service 
requests can be created online without having to call the service desk staff via telephone.  As a result, 
the number of calls made to the service desk are expected to decrease.  Of the calls that are made, the 
number that are answered by a live representative will increase and those going to voice message will 
decrease.   

As a service provider, the Information Technology Division defines its commitment to its clients 

in Service Level Agreements (SLAs). While some SLAs are already in place to govern the amount of 
time required to fulfill requests, new SLAs will be developed and implemented for all IT services and 
issue resolution. 

Key results: 

Desk staff.  

By 2019, at least 95% of customer calls during business hours will be answered by IT Service 

By 2020, SLAs will be developed and implemented for all IT services. 

By 2020, the SLA fulfillment rate will meet or exceed 95%. 

By 2020, an annual IT service satisfaction survey will be developed and administered.  

By 2020, 90% of customers will report satisfaction with IT services.  

ction 7.2: Increase Satisfaction with New Systems/Applications/Services   

Prior to the implementation and deployment of any new application or service to the Courts’ 

production environment, several iterations of requirements-gathering and testing are completed.  While 
the Information Technology Division works closely with stakeholders to provide solutions that meet 

 

  A

business needs, it will hold itself accountable for increased customer satisfaction results through the use 
 
of post-implementation surveys.  

By 2020, the Information Technology Division will work with the Strategic Management 

Division (SMD) to create a standardized new service post-implementation survey. 

By 2020, IT new service customer satisfaction rates will meet or exceed 90%. 

ction 7.3: Develop Escalation and Resolution Communications Strategy    

Escalation and resolution communications will be standardized to provide realistic expectations 
to customers.  Staff will be able to properly route escalation to the appropriate point of contact.  Unified 
communication technology solutions (text messaging, VoIP) will be optimized for communication 
delivery to customers.
