INSTRUCTIONS FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS OF THE  
VERIFIED COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE HOUSING CODE REGULATIONS AND 
SUMMONS TO APPEAR IN COURT AND NOTICE OF HEARING 

MPORTANT  NOTICE:    These  instructions  are  not  a  substitute  for  the  advice  of  a  lawyer.  
Landlord  and  tenant  law  can  be  very  complicated,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  address  every 
situation  in  these  instructions.    You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  to  help  you 
protect your legal rights.  You may also visit the Landlord Tenant Resource Center, Room 115, 
(9:15 a.m. – 12 p.m., Monday – Friday) for free legal information. 

  I

In order for the Housing Conditions Court to consider your claim for repairs, you must first properly serve on the 
Defendant  the  Verified  Complaint  to  Enforce  Housing  Code  Regulations  and  Summons  to  Appear  in  Court  and 
Notice of Hearing.  If you do not properly complete service of the Complaint and Summons the Court will not be 
able to address your claims and may dismiss your case.   

Service of process may be very difficult and complicated.  You are strongly encouraged to seek legal information 
from an attorney or through one of the organizations listed below.  The Clerk’s Office can answer basic questions 
about how to fill out Complaint and Summons forms, provide you with an instruction sheet describing how to serve 
the  Complaint  and  Summons,  and  give  you  other  basic  information.    The  Clerk’s  Office  cannot  give  you  legal 
advice. 

Free Legal Information 

The D.C. Bar’s Landlord Tenant Resource Center is open every day the Court is in session from 9:15 a.m. to 12:00 
p.m., and staffed with lawyers trained in landlord and tenant law.  If you do not have your own lawyer, the Resource 
Center may be able to answer your questions about service of the Complaint and Summons and other legal issues, 
free of charge.  The Resource Center is located in Room 115, next to the metal detectors, near the entrance to D.C. 
Superior Court Building B, 510 4th Street, N.W.  The Resource Center will help both landlords and tenants who do 
not have their own lawyers. 

You may also seek assistance with service of a Complaint and Summons from the following organizations:   

   Neighborhood Legal Services          (202) 269-5100   
   D.C. Law Students in Court             (202) 638-4798   
   The Legal Aid Society of D.C.         (202) 628-1161   

Legal Counsel for the Elderly               (202) 434-2120 
Bread for the City 
            (202) 265-2400 
D.C. Bar Legal Information Help Line (202) 626-3499 

 

You should attempt to complete service of process as soon as practicable once the Complaint and Summons are filed 
with  the  Clerk’s  Office.    Due  to  the  expedited  nature  of  the  Housing  Conditions  Calendar  you  must  serve  the 
Defendant at least eight (8) calendar days prior to date of the initial hearing for your case.  However, the judge sitting 
on the Housing Conditions Calendar may extend the time for service of process at his or her discretion.   

Timing of Service 

Affidavit of Service 

Once service of process is completed you must file with the Civil Actions Branch Clerk’s Office either an affidavit 
of service of process or acknowledgment of service of process at least three (3) calendar days prior to the date of the 
initial hearing in your case.  However, the judge sitting on the Housing Conditions Calendar may extend the time for 
filing the affidavit of service of process at his or her discretion.   

The Civil Actions Branch Clerk’s Office can provide you with an affidavit of service for you or your process server 
to complete upon request.   

   

Acceptable Methods of Service 

Service of the Complaint and Summons must be completed according to the requirements of Rule 4 of the Superior 
the  Court’s  website  at

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
