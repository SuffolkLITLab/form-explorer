INTRODUCTION 

raditional  courts  find  it  difficult  to  address  the  underlying  problems  that  may  lead 
individuals to commit crimes, due, in many cases, to larger case loads and an emphasis 
on processing cases.  Furthermore, in traditional courts, the handling of cases involving 
offenses  such  as  prostitution  and  drugs  has  done  little  to  change  the  behavior  of 
offenders, make streets safer, or enhance the quality of life in communities.  This leads 
communities  to  conclude  that  the  courts  do  little  to  reduce  recidivism  and  that  the 
criminal justice system is little more than a revolving door for offenders.   
  
Community courts seek to build stronger and safer neighborhoods, reduce recidivism and 
improve defendants’ lives by addressing the underlying problems that may lead them to 
commit  crimes,  and  increase  the  public's  trust  and  confidence  in  the  criminal  justice 
system.  Community courts strive to achieve these goals by utilizing a problem solving 
approach with a strong emphasis  on  building partnerships among government agencies, 
social  service  providers,  and  community  groups.    In  addition,  community  courts 
recognize that quality of life crime impacts the whole community as well as individuals.   
If not addressed, quality of life crime can erode community order, lead to neighborhood 
decay and create an atmosphere where more serious crime can flourish.   
  
The Superior Court of the District of Columbia (Superior Court) established the East of 
the  River  Community  Court  (ERCC)  in  September  2002.    This  problem-solving 
court was  a  response  to  the  challenges  faced  by  many  of  the  East  of  the  River 
communities  of  Washington,  DC,  including  increasing  rates  of  poverty,  crime  and 
disorder  that  were  higher  than  many  other  communities  of  the  city.1    In  addition, the 
Superior Court sought to achieve time-efficient misdemeanor case processing and reduce 
police  overtime.    Initially,  the  ERCC  handled  only  U.S.  misdemeanor  cases2  that 
originated  in  the  District  of  Columbia's  Sixth  Police  District  (6D)  but  did  not  involve 
domestic  violence.    In  June  of  2003,  the  ERCC  expanded  to  include  the  same  kinds  of 
cases originating in the Seventh Police District (7D). 
  
Currently,  the  ERCC  serves  as  a  calendar  court  that  adjudicates  all  U.S.  misdemeanor 
cases  not  involving  domestic  violence3  (e.g.,  drug  possession,  sexual  solicitation, 
unlawful  entry,  simple  assault,  and  illegal  dumping)  that  occur  in  the  East  of  the  River 
community.    One  judge  presides  over  the  ERCC  and  hears  all  phases  of  a  case  from 

                                                 
1 The East of the River community refers to the neighborhood east of the Anacostia River in the District of 
Columbia.   It is comprised of Police Districts 6D and 7D and approximates Wards 7 and 8 of the city. 
2 U.S.  misdemeanor cases are those cases prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office in contrast to 
other  lesser  misdemeanor  cases  (traffic  and  municipal)  prosecuted  by  the  DC  Office  of  the  Attorney 
General. 
3 All misdemeanor domestic violence cases are consolidated in Superior Court’s Domestic Violence Unit.

arraignment until final disposition.  (However, if a defendant decides to go to trial on a 
case, the case is then certified to another court for trial and if the defendant is convicted, 
the  sentencing.)      Such  continuity  allows  for  more  informed  judicial  decision-making.  
The  ERCC  involves  the  partnership  and  collaboration  of  several  agencies  and 
organizations  and  works  to  identify  social  services  needs  of  the  defendant  that  may  be 
driving his/her criminal behavior.  After fully assessing an individual's profile, including 
strengths  and  challenges,  the  ERCC  explores  diversion  or  plea  alternatives  geared 
towards addressing the identified social services needs.  Another important aspect of the 
ERCC  is  the  use  of  community  service  as  an  essential  component  of  diversion  or 
sentencing.    The  ERCC  holds  firmly  to  the  notion  that  defendants  who  are  adversely 
affecting the quality of life of a community should engage in restorative justice measures 
by providing service to that community.   

ince  ERCC's  inception,  the  calendar’s  Presiding  Judge  and  DCSC  staff  (as  part  of 
ERCC’s  community  engagement  activities)  and  representative  stakeholders  have 
regularly  participated  in  and  addressed  community  meetings  and  events  held  in  East  of 
the  River  neighborhoods.    As  a  result,  the  ERCC  has  obtained  information  regarding 
communities’ priorities involving public safety, views on their neighborhoods’ strengths 
and  resources  and  attitudes  toward  government  generally,  the  court  system  and 
community  court  in  particular.    This  information  is  critical  to  ERCC's  efforts  to  help 
solve community problems and involve community members and institutions in problem-
solving justice.   
  
In  July  of  2003,  the  Superior  Court  engaged  the  Center  for  Court  Innovation  (CCI)  to 
assist in the development of a strategy to enhance the ERCC’s operations in a number of 
key areas.4  As part of the strategy development, the Superior Court conducted a needs 
assessment  of  the  East  of  the  River  community.    The  community  needs  assessment 
included  data  analysis,  stakeholder  interviews,  focus  groups,  public  forums  and 
participation in numerous community meetings.  The results of the needs assessment are 
summarized  in  a  report,  dated  June  2005,  entitled  "Superior  Court  of  the  District  of 
Columbia, East of the River Community Court, Needs Assessment." Another June 2005 
report,  entitled  "Superior  Court  of  the  District  of  Columbia,  Recommendations  for  the 
East  of  the  River  Community  Court,"  provides  CCI's  final  recommendations  regarding 
how to enhance ERCC's efficiency, efficacy, and overall operations.5  

                                                 
4 CCI, an independent think tank and leader in the field of problem solving justice, founded and operates 
the nation's first community court, the Midtown Community Court in Manhattan, New York, as well as the 
highly acclaimed Red Hook Community Justice Center in Brooklyn, New York.

II.  MISSION STATEMENT AND GOALS 

he Superior Court's ERCC seeks to reduce low-level and quality-of-life offenses in East 
of  the  River  neighborhoods  by  utilizing  a  collaborative,  problem-solving  approach  to 
crime.    Partnering  with  government  agencies,  East  of  the  River  residents,  community 
organizations,  faith-based  groups,  social  services  providers,  and  businesses,  the  ERCC 
endeavors  to  hold  defendants  accountable,  address  the  factors  that  often  underlie 
defendants’  criminal  behavior,  improve  the  quality  of  life  in  East  of  the  River 
neighborhoods, and increase the public's confidence in the court system. 

he goals of the ERCC are to:

PARTICIPATING AGENCY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  

he Superior Court’s East of the River Community Court 

he  DCSC  is  the  court  of  general  jurisdiction  over  virtually  all  local  legal  matters  in 
Washington,  DC.    The  court  consists  of  divisions  that  provide  for  all  local  litigation 
functions  including  criminal,  civil,  probate,  tax,  landlord  and  tenant,  and  traffic.    Since 
2002,  a  separate  Family  Court  has  also  been  instituted  to  handle  neglect,  juvenile  and 
domestic relations matters 
  
The  DCSC’s  Criminal  Division  hears  all  local  criminal  matters  including  felony, 
misdemeanor,  and  traffic  cases.    The  Criminal  Division  also  provides  administrative, 
clerical,  and  support  services  necessary  to  process  the  cases  of  defendants  who  are 
charged with criminal offenses in the District of Columbia. 

he DCSC Criminal Division directs the operations of the ERCC.  The Presiding Judge 
of  the  ERCC  handles  all  the  U.S.  misdemeanor  cases  not  involving  domestic  violence 
that occur in 6D and 7D. 

he  ERCC  Judge  sets  the  conditions  under  which  all  defendants  are  released  prior  to 
disposition  of  the  case,  supervises  and  monitors  the  defendants  who  are  in  diversion 
programs, and sentences those who plead guilty.

East of the River Community Court Defense Attorneys 

he defense attorneys who most regularly represent defendants in ERCC are specifically 
trained  so  they  are  familiar  with  the  options  available  in  ERCC.    Recognizing  the 
beneficial  opportunities  to  their  clients  that  Community  Court  might  provide,  when 
appropriate,  defense  attorneys  advise  on  resolutions  of  cases  short  of  trial,  such  as 
diversion,  community  service  and  employment  programs.    When  deciding  to  give  such 
advice,  the  goal  is  to  identify  a  resolution  that  addresses  the  defendant’s  challenges 
including  any  drug  problems,  mental  health  issues  and  unemployment.  However,  the 
defense  attorney's  constitutional  and  ethical  duty  is  to  represent  his/her  client.    Thus, it 
might be the case that, despite the defendant's challenges; the attorney will advise his/her 
client  to  exercise  his/her  constitutional  right  to  trial.    If  the  defendant  makes  such  an 
election, the defendant's case will be certified to a regular criminal division calendar. 

he United States Attorney’s Office 

he  United  States  Attorney’s  Office  (USAO)  is  responsible  for  the  prosecution  of 
Superior  Court  misdemeanors  and  felonies  that  occur  in  the  District  of  Columbia.    The 
USAO is also responsible for prosecuting violations of the United States Code in United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia.6  Whit respect to the ERCC, the USAO 
reviews  cases  and  identifies  those  that  involve  defendants  whose  criminal  histories  are 
not significant, and who are currently charged with offenses that are not of a serious or 
violent  nature.    In  those  cases,  the  USAO  seeks  to  address,  where  possible,  the  root 
causes of a defendant’s illegal behavior and in doing so, to limit that defendant’s future 
interactions with the criminal justice system.  The USAO works to achieve this goal by 
using the twin threats of conviction and incarceration to motivate strict compliance with a 
set  of  conditions  that  are  tailored  to  address  the  defendant’s  underlying  problem  (e.g., 
drug use, lack of legitimate employment, etc.). 

The D.C. Pretrial Services Agency 

he  District  of  Columbia  Pretrial  Services  Agency  (PSA)  performs  two  critically 
important tasks that contribute significantly to the effective administration of justice and 
enhancement of public safety. 

SA gathers information about newly arrested defendants pertaining to eligibility for and 
risk if released pretrial, as well as available release options.  The information is presented 
to  the  judicial  officers  to  use  in  deciding  what,  if  any,  conditions  are  to  be  set  for 
defendants  released  (not  detained  at  the  jail  or  in  a  halfway  house)  pending  trial.    A 
judicial officer – a judge or magistrate judge – makes the initial pretrial release decision 
after taking into account the representations of the prosecutor and the defense attorney, as 
well as PSA’s release recommendation.  PSA provides objective, verified data about each 

                                                 
6      In  addition to  its  main  office  located  near  D.C.    Superior  Court,  USAO has  satellite  offices  in  police 
stations in each of the city’s 7 police districts.   Those offices are staffed by Community Prosecutors and 
Community  Outreach  Specialists  who  work  closely  with  the  police  and  citizens  to  address  crime-related 
issues in the community.

defendant to assist in judicial decision-making.  PSA recommendations address the flight 
and public safety risks associated with releasing defendants. 

SA also supervises those defendants whom the court orders released during the pretrial 
period by monitoring their compliance with their conditions of release.  Depending on the 
level  of  risk  posed  by  the  defendant,  PSA  supervision  may  include  contact  with  a  case 
manager, drug testing, curfew, electronic monitoring and sanction-based drug treatment.  
All PSA supervision programs give defendants the opportunity to participate in pro-social 
interventions  that  decrease  likelihood  of  future  criminal  behavior.    Throughout  the 
pretrial release period, PSA notifies the court, prosecution, and defense of noncompliance 
with release conditions. 

hen  PSA  performs  these  tasks  well,  unnecessary  pretrial  detention  is  minimized,  jail 
crowding  is  reduced,  public  safety  is  increased  and  the  pretrial  release  process  is 
administered fairly. 

ourt Services and Offender Supervision Agency 

he  Court  Services  and  Offender  Supervision  Agency  for  the  District  of  Columbia 
(CSOSA)  supervises  individuals  on  probation,  parole,  or  supervised  release.    In  the 
ERCC, CSOSA supervises probation cases.  For individuals who enter a guilty plea and 
receive probation, the agency monitors compliance with the conditions of probation and 
provides  case  management  services  based  on  the  individual’s  assessed  needs.    These 
services  include  frequent  contact  with  a  Community  Supervision  Officer,  routine  drug 
testing  and  placement  in  the  agency’s  substance  abuse  treatment,  when  appropriate  or 
court-ordered,  mental  health  evaluation  and  referral  for  treatment,  education  and 
employment  services.    The  CSOSA  officer  appears  in  the  ERCC  for  court-ordered 
monitoring of the case or when there is a “show cause” hearing because of an allegation 
that the offender has failed to abide by one or more conditions of probation.7  

etropolitan Police Department 

he  Metropolitan  Police  Department  (MPD)  serves  as  the  primary  law  enforcement 
agency  for  the  District  of  Columbia that  patrols,  investigates  and  arrests  individuals 
suspected of committing criminal offenses in the District.   
  
MPD  operates  out  of  seven  police  districts  that  comprise  the  entire  city  of  Washington 
D.C.  The East of the River area of the District of Columbia is comprised of 6D and 7D. 
  

                                                 
7 In addition, CSOSA operates two field offices and two learning labs in the East of the River community.   
Field units, housing Community Supervision Officers, are located at 1418 Good Hope Road, SE, and 3850 
South  Capitol  Street.      CSOSA’s  unit  for  Vocational  Opportunities  for  Training,  Education,  and 
Employment (VOTEE) operates learning labs at St.  Luke’s Center, 4923 East Capitol Street SE, and the 
Bellevue  Housing  and  Community  Services  Cooperative,  4415  South  Capitol  Street,  SW.    Community 
Relations Specialists maintain citizen and stakeholder advisory networks in 6D and 7D as well.

In addition, MPD has Police Service Areas, which are defined geographic boundaries that 
are  the  basic  foundation  of  community  policing  in  the  District.    Every  District  resident 
lives in a police service area, and each one of these areas has a team of police officers and 
officials specifically assigned to it.  The purpose of the police service areas is to ensure 
better police services for District neighborhoods.8  
  
  
IV.         CASE PROCESSING COMPONENTS 

ases  on    the  ERCC  calendar  involve  individuals  charged  with  non-domestic  violence 
U.S. Misdemeanor offenses that originate in Police Districts 6D and 7D.  However, if a 
defendant  has  pre-existing  U.S.  Misdemeanor  charges  pending  before  anther  Superior 
Court judge, the new case is assigned to that same judge. 

ligibility Criteria 

itation Release 

he Citation release program is an agreement between the Court, MPD and the Pretrial 
Services  Agency  which  allows  defendants  arrested  on  specific  charges  to  be  released 
from  the  police  station  in  lieu  of  detention  and  to  appear  in  court  on  a  designated  date 
approximately  two  or  three  weeks  in  the  future  for  arraignment.    Citation  release  is 
available for DC Code violations, Traffic and U.S. Misdemeanors cases.  Defendants are 
brought  to  the  station  house  and  booked.    MPD  logs  arrest  information  in  the  CJIS 
computer system that PSA continuously monitors.  PSA staff conducts criminal  history 
profiles that include FBI and warrant record checks to determine if the person is eligible 
for release.  Citation release is not permitted if the defendant has an outstanding warrant, 
is on probation or parole supervision, or has an extensive record of failure to appear or 
escape.   
  

 If the PSA staff deems the defendant as eligible for citation release, they note the request 
for an interview into the computer system.  The District Police Station calls PSA and a 
telephone  interview  of  the  defendant  is  conducted.    PSA  gathers  demographic  and 
community  ties  information  and  attempts  to  verify  that  information  with  those  persons 
whom the defendant has named as references.  After the information has been verified, 
PSA advises the defendant of the tentative release and what is required to comply with 
reporting  to  court.    MPD  makes  the  final  decision  whether  to  release  the  defendant  on 
citation.  If the defendant is to be released, PSA provides the officer with the next  

                                                 
8  In  MPD's  effort  to  prevent  crime  through  problem  solving  partnerships  with  the  community, each 
police district  station  is  the  host  of  various  community  meetings.    For  instance,  the  Citizens  Advisory 
Council (CAC) meets monthly at the police station.  CAC is an advisory panel in each police district that 
provides  the  district  commander  with  information  and  recommendations  from  the  community  on  the 
public's safety problems and police service needs.

available court date and logs the agreed upon date into the CJIS system.  This compiled 
list of defendants and their assigned court dates is distributed to MPD, OAG, USAO, and 
the Court to show who is expected to appear in court.   

efendants  who  are  not  released  within  48  hours  on  citation  are  held  in  custody  until 
arraigned.  PSA conducts a pretrial interview for the purpose of assessing the likelihood 
that  the  defendant  may  flee  or  pose  a  danger  to  any  other  person  or  the  community, 
gathering identifying information and determining possible social services needs.   

pon meeting with law enforcement personnel (the arresting officers) and discussing the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  the  alleged  offense,  the  USAO  makes  a  decision  about 
whether  and  with  what  offense  to  charge  a  defendant.    If  the  charge  is  a  U.S. 
misdemeanor  and  the  offense  occurred  in  6D  or  7D,  USAO  annotates  the  charging 
document to alert the Criminal Division Clerk's Office to route the case to ERCC.   

ock-up Cases 

apering Cases 

rraignment 

t the arraignment, the court formally advises the defendant of the charges filed by the 
USAO,  and  the  defendant,  with  the  advise  of  counsel,  enters  a  plea;  at  this  stage,  the 
entered plea is almost always "not guilty".  After hearing arguments from the prosecution 
and  defense,  the  Court  sets  the  date  for  the  next  hearing  and  decides  whether  to 
preventively  detain  the  defendant  or  set  conditions  for  his/her  release.    If  the  court 
releases the defendant, he/she signs notice to reappear.  If the defendant fails to appear 
for  the  status  hearing  or  any  other  subsequent  court  proceeding  for  which  he/she  has 
received notice, the Court can issue a bench warrant for the defendant's arrest.9 

n light of ERCC’s problem-solving approach, significantly more consultation occurs at 
this  stage  of  proceedings  between  prosecution  and  defense  than  in  other  courtrooms.  
This  level  of  consultation,  supported  by  the  pretrial  services  report  for  each  defendant, 
enables the court to craft better release options for these defendants, including first-day 
offers of diversion programs or guilty pleas.  If the case cannot be resolved on the first 
day, it is continued for a status hearing.10 

                                                 
9The  vast  majority  of  citation  and  lock-up  cases  originating  in  the  ERCC’s  target  neighborhoods  are 
arraigned in the ERCC.  A small portion of cases are arraigned in the general U.S. courtroom (C-10) and 
set for a status hearing in the ERCC.  This occurs for cases papered late in the day Monday through Friday 
or on Saturday and holidays when the ERCC is not in session.  In addition, certain cases originating from 
the  ERCC’s  target  neighborhoods  initially  charged  as  felonies  and  later  reduced  to  U.S.  misdemeanors 
might also be arraigned in C-10 and then transferred to the ERCC. 

0  It  is  not  unusual  for  more  than  one  status  hearing  to  take  place  prior  to  entry  into  formal  diversion.   
Some cases are resolved after several status hearings, ending with a dismissal/ “nollle prosequi” (an on-the-
record declaration that the prosecutor will proceed no further with a case).

Release Non-Compliance 

SA notifies the Court, USAO, and defense counsel of infractions of release conditions 
and  diversion  requirements  and  recommends  sanctions  for  noncompliance.    Upon 
receiving  information  of  an  alleged  violation  of    a  condition  of  release,  the  USAO 
considers, among other things, the nature of and reason for the violation in determining 
whether  to  move  for  revocation  or  modification  of  the  defendant's  release  status.    For 
example,  if  the  allegation  is  that  the  defendant  is  testing  positive  for  illegal  drugs,  the 
government  may  move  the  Court  to  order  the  defendant  placed  into  a  drug  treatment 
program as a condition of release.  If, on the other hand, the defendant’s release violation 
stems from a re-arrest (new charge) or an alleged violation of a “stay away” and/or a “no 
contact”  order,  the  government  is  more  likely  to  request  that  the  court  revoke  pretrial 
release  and  order  preventive  detention.    Ultimately,  the  Court,  after  hearing  arguments 
from the prosecution and the defense, decides whether the defendant has violated his/her 
release  conditions  and,  if  so,  what,  if  any,  modifications  are  to  be  made  to  the  release 
order. 

uring the status phase of the case, the defendant may elect to proceed with his/her case 
in one of three ways: diversion (if deemed eligible by the USAO), guilty plea or trial.  If 
the defendant exercises his/her right to a trial, the case is transferred out of ERCC to a 
conventional misdemeanor calendar/courtroom.   

tatus Hearing 

isposition 

f  a  defendant  completes  his/her  diversion  program,  the  USAO  will    nolle  prosequi  the 
case.  In the court’s data system, these cases are entered as “nolle diversion” in order to 
track the outcome of those cases entered into diversion. 

efendants who plead guilty may be sentenced by the judge to a term of incarceration or 
to a term of probation that may include community service east of the River and social 
services through CSOSA’s community supervision program.   

. 

DIVERSION OPTIONS 

he  decision  whether  or  not  to  divert  a  criminal  case  is  within  the  discretion  of  the 
USAO.   Should  a defendant’s  case be diverted, the  diversion agreement is between the 
defendant and the USAO.  Defendants who are testing positive for drugs are ineligible for 
any diversion option that includes community service.

If the USAO determines that a defendant has breached the agreement by violating one or 
more  of  the  terms  of  diversion,  it  is  within  the  USAO's  discretion  to  terminate  the 
agreement.11 

ases in the ERCC may be diverted in a number of ways as described below. 

irst Time Offender Program 

he USAO staff can offer diversion to those first-time non-violent defendants who admit 
criminal  responsibility.    Defendants  must  agree  to  perform  community  service  and/or 
attend education programs and not to incur new charges within a specified period of time 
(usually  six  months).    If  the  defendant  completes  the  mandate,  the  compliance 
information is provided to the court by the USAO and the case receives a nolle prosequi 
in court on the end date of the agreement. 

eferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) 

his  is  an  agreement  signed  by  the  defendant  with  the  advice  of  counsel  suspending 
prosecution of the case.  Defendants are required to perform community service and may 
have  other  mandates  that  must  be  completed  within  a  specified  time  period,  such  as 
obtaining  verified  employment.    While  under  the  DPA,  defendants  must  not  be  re-
arrested on new arrests/charges.  These defendants are supervised by PSA. 

 

Deferred Sentencing Agreement (DSA) 

efendants must enter a plea of guilty and sign a DSA agreeing to perform the required 
community service and any other mandates included in the agreement, and not to incur a 
new  charge  while  the  agreement  is  in  effect.    Sentencing  is  continued  for  a  specified 
period of time.  If the defendant successfully completes the agreement, the government 
permits  the  defendant  to  withdraw  his  guilty  plea  and  enter  a  nolle  prosequi  on  the 
sentencing date.  If the USAO terminates the agreement because of the defendant's non-
compliance, the defendant's case proceeds to sentencing.   

ohn School 

his USAO-sponsored program is a one-day educational program that is made available 
to  male  "Johns"  who  are  arrested  for  soliciting  for  prostitution,  and  who  have  not  been 
convicted of any violent offense within the past ten years, have not served a sentence, or 
been on probation or parole for a violent offense within the past ten years, and who have 
not  previously  been  diverted  through  this,  or  any  other  similar  program  in  another 
jurisdiction.    Participants  pay  $300  to  attend  educational  sessions  on  the  health  risks 

                                                 
11 If the defendant's non-compliance with a diversion agreement suggests he/she is better suited for another 
diversion program, the USAO can elect to approve the defendant for a second program.  For instance, if a 
defendant’s positive drug tests violate a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the defendant may be eligible for 
Drug Court.

involved  (particularly  HIV/AIDS)  in  prostitution  and  criminal  liability.    Some  of  the 
funds raised by this program are used to support diversion program for prostitutes.  The 
USAO provides compliance information to the Court.   

uperior Court Drug Intervention Program (Drug Court) 

his  is  a  specialized  court  for  the  treatment  of  non-violent  defendants  with  verified 
substance abuse problems.  Cases sent to Drug Court are no longer in the ERCC but still 
are supervised by PSA.  However, if they fail in Drug Court, they return to the ERCC. 

efendants  charged  with  unlawful  entry,  who  have  not  previously  benefited  from  a 
stet/diversion  agreement  in  any  jurisdiction  and  who  are  not  currently  on  probation  or 
parole in any jurisdiction, may request that their cases be considered for placement on the 
Stet Docket.   The case is held open for a fixed period of time (usually nine months) and 
the  defendant  agrees  to  stay  away  from  the  specified  location.    At  the  end  of  the  time 
period,  the  USAO  enters  a  nolle  prosequi  if  the  defendant  has  not  been  rearrested  or 
otherwise  violated  the  stay  away  order,  and  has  complied  with  all  other  Court  orders, 
including conditions of release. 

tet Docket 

ediation 

his program, supervised by the USAO staff, is used to resolve cases (usually limited to 
simple assault or destruction of property charges) in which the defendant and the victim 
have an on-going relationship to each other (except intra-family relationships, which are 
handled  by  the  Court’s  Domestic  Violence  Unit).    The  relationships  that  might  make 
defendants eligible to participate in this program include landlord/tenant, neighbors, and 
workplace colleagues.  If both are in agreement, the defendant and complaining witness 
are referred to the Center for Dispute Resolution, which conducts the mediation session 
and provides information to the USAO regarding its success.  In the event of a successful 
mediation, the USAO will enter a nolle prosequi.  If the mediation was unsuccessful, the 
USAO will proceed with the prosecution of the case. 

ridges – Early Intervention Program for Female Prostitutes 

arly  Intervention  Program  for  Female  Prostitution:    Female  defendants  charged  with 
prostitution who have not previously been convicted of two or more prostitution charges, 
have not participated in a similar diversion program in any jurisdiction, who do not have 
a pending case involving a violent felony offense, and are not on probation or parole for a 
violent felony offense are eligible for this program.  Defendants must complete the Early 
Intervention  one-day  course  that  discusses  behavior  patterns,  addictions,  destructive 
lifestyle  choices,  and  abusive  relationships  that  may  entrap  them  into  a  life  of 
prostitution.    Upon  the  successful  completion  of  the  program,  the  defendant’s  case 
remains open for four months with an order to stay away from the area where the crime

occurred.  Assuming no re-arrests during the four-month period, the United States enters 
a nolle prosequi.   

n  all  the  diversion  programs,  the  USAO  and  the  defendant  enter  into  the  diversion 
agreement.    PSA  and  the  USAO  monitor  the  defendant’s  performance  under  the 
agreement and notify the ERCC judge and USAO of his/her progress.  Additionally, PSA 
provides the USAO with a recommendation to either maintain the agreement or terminate 
it if the defendant fails to comply with its requirements.  If the USAO determines that a 
defendant has breached the agreement by violating one or more of the terms of diversion, 
it  is  within  the  USAO’s  discretion  to  terminate  the  agreement.    If  the  defendant's  non-
compliance results in termination of the diversion agreement, the criminal prosecution of 
the defendant's case resumes.  In DPAs, this results in a trial date being set, or a guilty 
plea being entered.  If a DSA is terminated, the case proceeds directly to sentencing, as 
the defendant already entered a guilty plea as a condition of the DSA diversion option.

hen defendants are released after arraignment, they are instructed by the Court to report 
to the Pretrial Services Agency’s office in Room C-301 in the courthouse to review the 
conditions  of  release  and/or  diversion  requirements.    They  are  also  placed  in  the  drug-
testing  program,  if  ordered.    PSA’s  Drug  Testing  and  Compliance  Unit  operate  the  on-
site  drug-testing  program.12    In  Room  C-301  defendants  are  instructed  to  contact  their 
assigned Pretrial Services Officer (PSO) within 48 hours of their release; however, they 
are  encouraged  to  go  directly  from  the  court  to  meet  with  their  assigned  PSO.    The 
Pretrial Officers assigned to handle ERCC defendants are located in 601 Indiana Avenue. 
   
Defendants  who  are  under  diversion  and  required  to  complete  community  service  are 
instructed  to  contact  PSA  for  a  community  service  referral  within  48  hours  of  their 
release.    All  defendants  must  report  to  review  their  conditions  of  release  and  diversion 
requirements.  PSA provides the defendant with a community service referral form that 
specifies, among other things, the number of community service hours to be completed.  
Defendants  are  then  sent  to  PSA’s  Social  Services  and  Assessment  Center  (SSAC)  to 
receive  an appointment to a community  services host site in the 6D or 7D and/or other 
community  services  host  site  providers.    Upon  receiving  an  appointment  slip,  the 
defendant is required to perform the community hours at that host site.   
 

                                                 
12 In addition to other requirements, defendants subject to drug testing usually are tested each week for the 
first 12 weeks and may be considered for less frequent drug testing if they repeatedly test negative for drug 
use.

Community Service 

SA established a community service option in response to ERCC’s interest in utilizing 

community service as a component of diversion programs.   

he  Community  Justice  Resources  Branch  staff  is  responsible  for  outreach  to  identify 
community  service  opportunities.    Relationships  with  organizations  that  provide  these 
opportunities are formalized with Letters of Agreement (LOAs) between the PSA and the 
community organization. 

he  SSAC  staff  is  responsible  for  assigning  community  court  defendants  to  one  of 
several  community  service  host  sites  identified  by  the  Branch.    The  SSAC    assigns 
defendants

participation.    The  process  begins  with  the  defendant  reporting  to  his/her  case  manager 
for orientation and receipt of a referral packet.   

to  host  sites  and  receives 

information  concerning 

efendants are required to report to PSA within a specified time frame to provide proof 
of  community  service  completion.    Host  sites  also  maintain  a  daily  log  of  defendants 
completing community service at their site.  These logs are used to cross-check tracking 
sheets  that  individual  defendants  are  required  to  submit  in  order  to  verify  compliance.  
Defendants  who  fail  to  maintain  contact  with  PSA  or  are  otherwise  non-compliant    are 
reported to the ERCC by PSA.  This includes those defendants that fail to complete the 
community  service  mandate  within  the  specified  time  frame  outlined  in  the  diversion 
agreement.    In  severe  cases,  the  diversion  agreement  may  be  terminated.    Non-
compliance can also involve failing to adhere to other court mandates; these could

In  order  to  develop  performance  measures  and  track  progress,  the  participating 
agencies will  collaboratively establish a  coordinated  data  collection  and  reporting 
mechanisms  that  will  allow  systemic  analysis  of  the  data.    Additional  information 
regarding statistical reporting will be made available once these mechanisms have been 
put into place.
