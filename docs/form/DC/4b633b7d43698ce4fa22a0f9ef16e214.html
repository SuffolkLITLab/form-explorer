   RESPONDENT. 

PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF STANDBY GUARDIAN 
(By Standby Guardian Designate) 

I, _________________________, am the Petitioner/Standby Guardian in this case and state that: 

PRINT YOUR NAME 

1. This  Court  has  the  authority to decide  my petition  for appointment of a guardian for
minor children because: [CHECK ONE] 

  Home State. The District of Columbia is the child(ren)’s “home state” because the 
child(ren) currently live(s) in the District of Columbia AND has/have lived in the District 
of Columbia for at least six months immediately before filing this Petition. 

  Home State. The child(ren) do not currently live in the District of Columbia, BUT the 
District of Columbia was the “home state” AND the child(ren) has/have been away from 
the District of Columbia for less than six months before the filing of this Complaint AND 
a parent or a person acting as a parent continues to live in the District of Columbia. 

D.C. Bar Pro Bono Center (revised 03/2019)Petition for Appointment of Standby Guardian (by Standby Guardian Designate) - Page 1 of 10  Significant Connections.  There is no “home state” or the “home state” has declined 
to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that the District of Columbia is the more 
appropriate forum AND the child(ren) and at least one parent or person acting as a parent 
has a significant connection with the District of Columbia AND there is substantial 
evidence available in the District of Columbia concerning the child(ren)’s care, 
protection, training and personal relationships. 

  More Appropriate Court.  All courts with jurisdiction have declined to exercise 
their jurisdiction in favor of the District of Columbia because this is the more appropriate 
Court to determine standby guardianship of the child(ren). 

  No Other Court.  There is no other court with jurisdiction to determine standby 
guardianship of the child(ren). 

  Temporary Emergency Jurisdiction.  The District of Columbia is not the “home 
state” BUT the child(ren) is/are present in the District of Columbia AND the child(ren) 
has/have been abandoned OR it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child(ren) 
because the child(ren), or a sibling or parent of the child(ren), is/are subjected to or 
threatened with mistreatment or abuse.

Service of Your Complaint: Domestic Relations Rule 4 
 
You start a case by filing papers called a complaint at the Family Court Central Intake Center. When you file 
a complaint, the Family Court Central Intake Center will give you a summons.  A summons is a paper that you 
must give to the person you are filing against. The person you file against is called an opposing party or other 
party. You must make sure that the opposing party gets a copy of the summons and your complaint and any 
orders. This is called service of your complaint. You cannot give the papers to the opposing party yourself; 
someone else must give them to the opposing party.  The chart below gives instructions on how to serve the 
complaint and summons.   

fter you make sure that someone else gives the papers to the other party, you must prove to the Court that you 
did this. You can prove this to the Court by filing an Affidavit of Service form. You must serve the papers and 
file an Affidavit of Service form within 60 days after you file your complaint. If you have questions about 
serving  these  documents,  go  to  the  Family  Court  Self  Help  Center  at  DC  Superior  Court  or  visit 
www.LawHelp.org/DC. 

emember to always keep a copy of the papers for yourself. And, you may need to make more copies to serve 

the other party in a different way.  

elow are the ways you can serve your complaint and summons and prove to the Court that you did it. All 
of the forms discussed below can be found at the Family Court Self Help Center at DC Superior Court or at

D.C. Bar Pro Bono Center (revised 03/2019)Petition for Appointment of Standby Guardian (by Standby Guardian Designate) - Page 9 of 10Mail the papers to the other party 
by first class mail (postage prepaid) 
and include: 

•  An envelope addressed to you with a 
stamp on it (so that the other party 
can mail the Court’s Notice and 
Acknowledgement form back to 
you); and  

•  Two (2) copies of the 
Court’s Notice and 
Acknowledgment form 
(one for the other party to 
keep and one for you).   

•  The  signed  Notice  and  Acknowledgement 

form is the proof of service. 

•  The  other  party  has  21  days  from  the  date  the 
letter is mailed to sign and return the Notice and 
Acknowledgement form to you.   
If the other party returns the completed form, file 
the  completed  Notice  and  Acknowledgement 
form  at  the  Family  Court  Central  Intake 
Center. 

• 

•  Note: If the other party does not return the form, 
you will need to serve the papers in a different 
way.  If this happens, you can ask the Court to 
order the other party to pay you back any money 
you spend serving the papers in another way.  

 

f you are asking for child support or to establish parentage of a child, the Family Court Central Intake 
Center will issue you a Notice of Hearing and Order Directing Appearance (also called a NOHODA).  There are 
special instructions for serving a NOHODA, these can be found at the Family Court Self Help Center and online 
at www.ProBono.center/NOHODAInstructions 

f you need more than 60 days to serve the papers, you can ask the judge to give you more time.  You can ask 
for more time by filing a Motion for Additional Time to Serve.  You must ask for more time to serve and a new 
summons before the first summons expires.  If you do not do this, the Family Court Central Intake Center may 
dismiss your complaint. You can get a Motion for Additional Time to Serve at the Family Court Self Help 
Center at DC Superior Court or visit www.LawHelp.org/DC. 

f you tried but were not able to serve the other party or parties using any of the methods above, you can 
ask the judge to let you serve the parties in a different way by filing a Motion for Alternative Service.  You can 
get  a  Motion  for  Alternative  Service  at  the  Family  Court  Self  Help  Center  at  DC  Superior  Court  or  visit 
www.LawHelp.org/DC.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
