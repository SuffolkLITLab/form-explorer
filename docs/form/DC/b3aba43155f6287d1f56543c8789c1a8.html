FOREWORD 

his manual of the DC Misdemeanor and Traffic Community Court’s (DCMTCC) 

policies and procedures seeks to introduce the overall philosophy, direction and 
operations of the DCMTCC.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive, step-by-step, how-
to, instruction manuscript.  Rather, it generally describes, through its various sections, the 
alliances and collaboration between stakeholder agencies that are vital to realizing the 
mission of the DCMTCC.  It is our hope that this manual will serve as a tool to assist the 
reader in understanding the basic operations of the DCMTCC.  More detailed information 
regarding the operations and systems of the partnering agencies may be obtained by 
contacting the individual agencies enumerated in the narrative that follows.

raditional courts find it difficult to address the underlying problems that may lead 
individuals to commit crimes, due, in many cases, to larger case loads and an emphasis 
on processing cases.  Furthermore, in traditional courts, the handling of cases involving 
offenses such as panhandling or disorderly conduct has done little to change the behavior 
of offenders, make streets safer, or enhance the quality of life in communities.  This leads 
communities to conclude that the courts do little to reduce recidivism and that the 
criminal justice system is little more than a revolving door for offenders.   
  
Community courts seek to build stronger and safer neighborhoods, reduce recidivism and 
improve defendants’ lives by addressing the underlying problems that may lead them to 
commit crimes, and increase the public's trust and confidence in the criminal justice 
system.  Community courts strive to achieve these goals by utilizing a problem solving 
approach with a strong emphasis on building partnerships among government agencies, 
social service providers, and community groups.  In addition, community courts 
recognize that quality of life crime impacts the whole community as well as individuals. 
If not addressed, quality of life crimes can erode community order, lead to neighborhood 
decay and create an atmosphere where more serious crime can flourish.   
  
The Superior Court of the District of Columbia (Superior Court) established the DC 
Misdemeanor and Traffic Community Court (DCMTCC) in January 2002.1   This 
problem-solving court was a response to the challenges presented by many individuals 
who commit lower level criminal offenses (DC misdemeanor offenses such as possession 
of an open container of alcohol, panhandling, urinating in public and disorderly conduct) 
and/or criminal traffic violations (such as no permit, unregistered auto, operating after 
suspension, and driving while intoxicated) in Washington, DC. (A significant percent of 
the court’s business is handling criminal traffic violations.)  In addition, the Superior 
Court sought to achieve time-efficient and time-effective misdemeanor case processing 
and reduce police overtime.  The DCMTCC tries to be holistic and creative in its 
approach to “quality of life” and criminal traffic offenses while maintaining sanctions and 
punishment when appropriate.  
  
Currently, one judge presides over the DCMTCC, arraigns all cases and keeps the case as 
long as an outcome involving diversion is possible. Such continuity allows for more 
uniform judicial decision-making.  If a case is too serious for diversion to be a 
consideration, it is referred to the DC Misdemeanor and Traffic Trial Court Calendar.  
The case is also sent to this calendar when the defendant wishes to go to trial or if the 
defendant is not successful in diversion.

The DCMTCC involves the partnership and collaboration of a number of agencies and 
organizations. It works to hold defendants accountable but also give defendants the 
opportunity and time to correct problems that could result in prosecutors entering a nolle 
prosequi (dismissal). It also works to identify and address the social services needs of 
defendants that may underlie defendants’ criminal behaviors, through social service 
referrals. After assessing defendants, including their strengths and needs, the DCMTCC 
explores diversion or plea alternatives.  Another important aspect of the DCMTCC is the 
use of community service as an essential component of diversion.  The DCMTCC holds 
firmly to the notion that defendants who are adversely affecting the quality of life of a 
community should give back to the community by providing community service.   

I.  MISSION STATEMENT AND GOALS  

he DCMTCC seeks to reduce DC misdemeanor and criminal traffic offenses by 

utilizing a collaborative, problem-solving approach to crime.  Partnering with 
government agencies, non-profit organizations, and social services providers, the 
DCMTCC endeavors to hold defendants accountable, address the factors that often 
underlie defendants’ criminal behavior, improve the quality of life in Washington, DC, 
and increase the public's confidence in the court system. 

he goals of the DCMTCC are to:  

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

Improve public safety and improve the quality of life in Washington, DC, 
through recidivism reduction and the performance of community service by 
defendants;  
Improve defendants’ lives and accountability by linking defendants with 
social services to change antisocial and/or personally debilitating behavior 
and requiring community service;  
Increase public awareness of the DCMTCC and increase public trust and 
confidence in the court system.

PARTICIPATING AGENCY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  

he Superior Court of the District of Columbia  

he Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction over virtually all local legal 
matters in Washington, DC.  The Court consists of divisions that provide for all local 
litigation functions including criminal, civil, probate, tax, landlord and tenant, and traffic.  
Since 2002, a separate Family Court has also been instituted to handle neglect, juvenile 
and domestic relations matters. 
  
The Superior Court’s Criminal Division hears all local criminal matters including felony, 
misdemeanor, and criminal traffic cases.  The Criminal Division also provides

4

administrative, clerical, and support services necessary to process the cases of defendants 
who are charged with criminal offenses in the District of Columbia. 

he Superior Court's Criminal Division directs the operations of the DCMTCC.  The 

Presiding Judge of the DCMTCC arraigns all DC misdemeanor and criminal traffic cases, 
not involving domestic violence, in the District of Columbia. 

he DCMTCC Judge establishes the tone for this interactive problem-solving court and 

conveys the seriousness of the proceeding along with the parameters for ultimate 
resolution of the cases. The Judge sets the conditions under which all defendants are 
released prior to disposition of their case, reviews the progress of the defendants who are 
in diversion programs, and sentences those defendants that plead guilty.  

he Office of the Community Court Coordinator is located within the Superior Court’s 

Criminal Division.  The office staff includes the Community Court Coordinator, the 
DCMTCC Community Court Case Manager, the Community Court Assistant as well as a 
part-time Community Court Researcher and part-time graduate social work student 
interns during the academic year. 

he Community Court Coordinator is responsible for supervising the office staff and for 

coordinating the activities of the DCMTCC as well the East of the River Community 
Court (ERCC).  

The DCMTCC Case Manager and social work interns perform four important activities: 

(1) Conduct voluntary interviews/social services needs assessments utilizing a 

comprehensive interview/ assessment form of DC misdemeanor defendants who 
are awaiting arraignment detained in the Central Cell Block in the Superior Court 
Courthouse. 

(2) Identify possible social services and treatment programs for defendants. 
(3) Provide oral and written findings and recommendations to the Court. 
(4) Provide defendants with information about social services programs. 

CMTCC Community Court Defense Attorneys  

n any given day, the DCMTCC processes over 100 defendants.  In order to safeguard 

the integrity of the justice system, as well as improve its efficiency, a court appointed 
Duty Attorney Program was established.  Court appointed duty attorneys assist 
unrepresented defendants facing criminal charges and potential jail sentences in 
DCMTCC.  Because DCMTCC deals with criminal matters, the defendant’s 
Constitutional rights, including the right to trial, must be recognized and protected.  No 
defendant should appear before the Court without the assistance of counsel.  Duty 
attorneys fulfill this role of Constitutional guardian by acting as a buffer between the 
defendant and both the Court and the Prosecutor.  When represented defendants appear 
before the Court, duty attorneys will occasionally act as stand-in counsel if a defendant’s 
attorney cannot be present.

uty attorneys begin by conducting an initial screening of all unrepresented defendants.  

This screening process involves interviewing the defendant, reviewing the defendant’s 
charges and discovery packet, and discussing potential courses of actions with the 
defendant.  During the screening process, duty attorneys draw on their knowledge of the 
law, familiarity with the Court’s procedures, and understanding of the Prosecutor’s 
policies.  Defendants are fully advised of the Court’s procedures, their legal rights, and 
their potential options.  An individual’s unique circumstances are also explored.  By the 
end of the screening process, defendants have a firm understanding of their rights and the 
court process.  With this understanding, they begin developing reasonable expectations 
regarding their matters.  Informed defendants are more comfortable with the DCMTCC 
and more open to the curative approaches offered.   

uty attorneys then act as communication conduits between the defendant, the Court and 

the prosecution.  A defendant’s diversion options are explored, unique circumstances 
conveyed, and position voiced to both the Court and the prosecution.  If diversion options 
are available and acceptable to the defendant, duty attorneys inform the defendant of 
exactly what is expected of them.  The defendant leaves court fully informed, and 
knowing exactly what is required of them.  They are told exactly what documents and 
proof must be provided to the Court on their next appearance date so that the case can be 
dismissed.   

efendants who do not want to participate in one of the numerous diversion programs or 

do not qualify for a program may wish to dispose of their case by way of a guilty plea.  
Duty attorneys can handle these dispositions if the defendant, after being fully informed, 
still wishes to resolve the case that day.   

uty attorneys help defendants reschedule their case if they are not diversion eligible or 

prefer to hire their own attorney.  On behalf of indigent defendants, duty attorneys 
petition the Court to appoint counsel from the D.C. Panel Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 
Attorney list.2     

uty attorneys are appointed for a single day; the individuals they assist are not their 

clients.  The relationship with a defendant terminates at the end of the day.  If a defendant 
must return to court to demonstrate completion of a diversion program, the duty attorney 
assigned for that day will assist them on the new date. 

n providing services to unrepresented defendants, duty attorneys also speak with family 
and friends who appear in support of a defendant.  They contact individuals that may be 
willing to post a defendant’s bond, and they obtain or verify information that may assist 
the Court in making release decisions.  The Duty Attorney Program plays an important 
role in assuring that just and proper resolutions of cases are efficiently achieved. 

                                                
2 The CJA list consists of attorneys, pre-screened by a judicial panel that may be appointed to indigent 
clients.

The Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia  

he Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia (OAG) represents the 
District of Columbia and is responsible for the prosecution of DC misdemeanors and 
criminal traffic offenses that occur in the District of Columbia.   

olice officers, who have made an arrest for a DC misdemeanor or criminal traffic case, 
appear at OAG's office where the formal charging document, an Information, is prepared.  
Once the case is papered, the Information is taken to the intake office of the Criminal 
Division in the courthouse.  There, the court jacket is prepared and the case is assigned a 
number.  Cases are then presented in Court. 

ith respect to the DCMTCC, OAG reviews cases and identifies the ones that are 

eligible for diversion.  The cases generally involve defendants who do not have 
significant criminal histories and are currently charged with minor offenses.  In these 
cases, OAG seeks to address some of the root causes of a defendant’s illegal behavior.  
By addressing the root causes, OAG’s goal is to limit that defendant’s future interactions 
with the criminal justice system.  Cases that are not eligible for diversion are set for status 
or trial. 

AG has one Assistant Attorney General specifically assigned to DCMTCC.  That 

attorney is referred to as the Community Court Prosecutor (CCP). The CCP creates and 
facilitates diversion programs which serve as alternatives to traditional prosecution.  One 
of the duties of the CCP is to conduct arraignments in the DCMTCC.  At each 
arraignment, the CCP reviews the case and determines whether the case is diversion 
eligible.  Cases which are diversion eligible are set for future status hearings in the 
DCMTCC.  The CCP will also facilitate these status hearings.  In addition to the CCP’s 
courtroom responsibilities, the CCP also assists in the development of diversion 
programs. The CCP and defense counsel work closely to resolve any diversion-related 
issues that arise.   

he District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency  

he District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) provides case management and 

supervision during the pretrial release period and facilitates treatment services for up to 
five DC misdemeanor and criminal traffic cases (defendants) at one time. These cases 
(defendants) are referred by the Community Court Coordinator’s staff for supervision and 
specialized treatment of mental health issues and/or substance abuse.  These special cases 
are supervised in accordance with the policies and procedures for other cases under PSA 
supervision. If a defendant with a DC misdemeanor/criminal traffic violation is in bench 
warrant status for over 60 days, PSA will remove this defendant from the DC 
misdemeanor/criminal traffic violation Supervision List in order to free slots for other 
defendants. PSA does not accept probation cases or defendants who have other pending 
criminal matters. The PSA designee will contact the supervising case manager and 
inform them of the new DC misdemeanor/criminal traffic violation and assessment needs.  
PSA will send court reports to the judiciary at every court date to advise regarding 

  T

treatment status, recommendations for enhanced treatment, show cause requests, and 
continuation in services. Throughout the pretrial release period, PSA notifies the Court, 
prosecution, and defense of noncompliance with release conditions.  

he DCMTCC Case Process is as follows: 

(1) A representative of Community Court will contact the PSA designee to identify 

the availability of open slots. 

2) If space is available, the defendant is referred to the Social Services & 

Assessment Center (SSAC) for a substance abuse assessment and/or a mental 
health assessment. 

3) If substance abuse or mental health services are not deemed necessary, PSA’s 

responsibilities will discontinue and the Court will be so advised. 

4) If services are deemed necessary, the SSAC will notify the PSA designee for 

further instructions. 

  (

  (

  (

(5) If the defendant is eligible for drug treatment, a representative from the Sanction-

Based Treatment Unit (SBTU) will report to court to officially place the 
defendant in a PSA Unit, as well as refer to contracted treatment vendor. 

(6) If the defendant is in need of mental health or co-occurring disorder treatment, 

PSA will send a representative from the    Specialized Supervision Unit (SSU) to 
commence PSA supervision of the defendant and connect him or her to the 
Department of Mental Health for services. 

retrial Services Officers (PSO’s) supervising DC misdemeanor/criminal traffic violation 

cases are responsible for keeping the PSA designee abreast of updates, changes and 
dispositions in   these cases. 

n addition, when a DCMTCC defendant appears on the lock-up list, PSA forwards a 
Pretrial Services Report to DCMTCC on the day of his or her arraignment. The Pretrial 
Services reports do not include interviews, only a criminal history. If the person is 
released on citation, a report is not provided. Also, if the lock-up arrest is a DC 
misdemeanor or traffic bench warrant a Pretrial Services Report is generally not 
provided. PSA provides reports for all new cases that appear on the lock up list. 

ourt Services and Offender Supervision Agency  

he Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia 
(CSOSA) supervises individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release.  In the 
DCMTCC, CSOSA supervises probation cases.  For individuals placed on supervised 
probation, the agency monitors compliance with the conditions of probation and provides 
case management services based on the individual’s assessed needs.  These services 
include frequent contact with a Community Supervision Officer, routine drug testing and 

  T

placement in the agency’s substance abuse treatment (when appropriate or court-
ordered), mental health evaluation and referral for treatment, education and employment 
services.  The CSOSA officer appears in the DCMTCC when there is a “show cause” 
hearing because of an allegation that the offender has failed to abide by one or more 
conditions of probation.  

SOSA’s Traffic Alcohol Program (TAP) supervises Court-ordered supervised probation 

cases resulting from traffic alcohol related offenses. The primary goal of the Traffic 
Alcohol Program is to assess offender risk and needs, ensure treatment of offenders, 
provide close supervision and support referrals to treatment programs. Offenders who are 
currently serving community supervision terms on a US misdemeanor or felony 
conviction with CSOSA/Community Supervision Services remain with their assigned 
Community Supervision Officer if convicted of a traffic offense during a subsequently 
imposed supervision term.    

SOSA refers those offenders who have been convicted of driving while intoxicated and 

are court-ordered to attend a victim sensitivity group, the Remove Intoxicated Drivers 
Victim Impact Panel.  The group meets once a month. There is a nominal fee to 
participate. 

t least one victim presents to the group of offender's the impact of driving while 

intoxicated.  Additionally, the facilitator shares related videos, newspaper and magazine 
articles. It has been found that a cumulative effect of victimization has provided the best 
result in the Victim Impact Panel. 

etropolitan Police Department 

he Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) serves as the primary law enforcement 
agency for the District of Columbia that patrols, investigates and arrests individuals 
suspected of committing criminal offenses in the District. 3   
  
MPD operates out of seven police districts that comprise the entire city of Washington, 
DC. These seven police districts are augmented by numerous support and administrative 
positions and assignments, which also feed into the Community Court process.    
In addition, MPD has divided each district into Police Service Areas, which have defined 
geographic boundaries and are the basic building blocks of community policing in the 
District.  Every District resident lives in a police service area, and each one of these areas 
has a team of police officers and officials specifically assigned to it.  The purpose of the 
police service areas is to ensure better police services for District neighborhoods.4  

                                                 
3 In addition to defendants arrested by MPD, the DCMTCC also receives defendants who are arrested for 
DC misdemeanor and criminal traffic offenses by the other law enforcement agencies that operate within 
and serve the District of Columbia  
4  Consistent  with  MPD’s  effort  to  prevent  crime  through  problem  solving  partnerships  with  the 
community, each  police district  station  is  the  host  of  various  community  meetings.    For  instance,  each 
district’s Citizens Advisory Council (CAC) meets monthly at the police station.  The CAC is an advisory

n conjunction with the mission of the MPD to prevent crime and the fear of crime, 
including terrorism (foreign and domestic), MPD is committed to working with its 
partners to build safe, healthy and prepared neighborhoods throughout the District of 
Columbia. To this end, MPD believes in and works closely with the DCMTCC to achieve 
its mission.  

istrict of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles  

he Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is responsible for ensuring the safety of 

vehicular movement in the District of Columbia through the vetting, testing and 
credentialing of drivers and verification of ownership, operability, and insurance of 
vehicles. 

n carrying out these state-level functions, the DMV manages the licensing and driver 
records of over 350,000 drivers, and the titling and registration of over 240,000 vehicles.    
In addition, due to the unique governmental structure of the District of Columbia, the 
DMV manages the information systems, payment and de-criminalized adjudication of 
parking and minor moving violations, involving nearly three million tickets issued by 29 
agencies having enforcement authority within the Districts boundaries. 

iolations of DMV requirements constitute a large proportion of the infractions that 
result in appearances at the DCMTCC. As a result, the DMV has sought a more integral 
role with the Court and related agencies.   This has resulted in better coordination and 
exchange of driver record and ticket infraction information with the prosecuting agencies 
and the Court.   In addition, the DMV seeks to provide better coordination of compliance 
services, access to licensing and registration services, and remedial actions that will 
ensure compliance with driving regulations and the Court’s instructions. 

istrict of Columbia Department of Mental Health Services  

he primary mission of Department of Mental Health (DMH) is to address  

the mental health services and support needs of District residents.  DMH provides the 
funding, planning and monitors the mental health system for adults, children, youth and 
families.  Services are provided directly through a network of community mental health 
provider agencies and St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. 
   
In 2005, DMH began increased focus on services to individuals who interfaced with the 
criminal justice system.  The DMH Jail Diversion Program, known as DC Linkage Plus is 
responsible for facilitating Mental Health Rehabilitation Services (MHRS) to individuals 
involved in the criminal justice system.  The program provides screenings and referral 
services to community service agencies, as well as facilitates the continuity of care for 
individuals already linked to a community service agency.  Services are coordinated for 
individuals referred from the Courts, PSA, in-patient forensic services, the Department of 
                                                                                                                                                 
panel in each police district that provides the district commander with information and recommendations 
from the community on the public's safety problems and police service needs.

Corrections, individuals re-entering the community from the prison and those identified 
by the homeless outreach program who may have frequent contact with the Metropolitan 
Police Department.   

n February 2006, DMH began providing coverage to DCMTCC to screen individuals 
referred from the Court for mental health services and to provide linkage and monitoring 
of the connection to services.   

he DMH Court Liaison is available by direct line or by cell phone to DCMTCC staff on 

a daily basis.   Defendants who report a mental illness and/or are observed to exhibit 
behavior that may require intervention are screened and assessed for mental illness.   A 
determination of enrollment in the mental health system is carried out.  The Core Service 
Agency (CSA) Clinical Supervisor is contacted regarding any defendants known in the 
system.  Appointment date, time and person to be seen are scheduled and this information 
provided to the defendant and the Court.  The DMH Court Liaison monitors if the 
defendant kept the appointment and notifies the Court regarding the status.  Defendants 
not known to a DMH provider, but in need of services are referred and connected directly 
to one of the DC Linkage Plus CSAs for services.  The defendant is given an appointment 
date, time and person to see.  This information is also provided to the Court.  Monitoring 
for compliance with recommendations for treatment is provided to the Court.  The DMH 
Court Liaison works closely with the DCMTCC staff and attends regular monthly 
community court meetings. 

V.         CASE PROCESSING COMPONENTS 
   
Eligibility Criteria/Entry of Cases into the DCMTCC 

ases on the DCMTCC calendar involve individuals charged with DC misdemeanor 
offenses and criminal traffic cases that originate anywhere in the District of Columbia.5  

rrest and Citation Release Cases 

he Citation release program allows law enforcement officers to release defendants who 
were arrested on certain misdemeanor charges.  The defendants who are released are then 
required to appear in Court on a designated date approximately two or three weeks.  
Defendants are brought to the station house and booked.  MPD logs arrest information in 
the CJIS computer system that PSA continuously monitors.  PSA staff conducts criminal 
history profiles that include FBI and warrant record checks to determine if the person is 
eligible for release.  Citation release is not permitted if the defendant has an outstanding 
warrant, is on probation or parole supervision, has an extensive record of failure to appear 
or escape, inaccurately reports information, cannot conduct an interview or his/her name 
and/or place of residence cannot be reasonably identified.   

                                                 
5  Civil traffic infractions are handled by the Bureau of Traffic Adjudication, a part of the Department of 
Motor Vehicles.

If PSA staff deems the defendant eligible for citation release, they request an interview.  
The District Police Station calls PSA and a telephone interview of the defendant is 
conducted. PSA gathers demographic and community ties information and attempts to 
verify that information with the defendant’s references. After the information has been 
verified, PSA advises the defendant of the tentative release and the requirement of a court 
appearance.  MPD then makes the final decision whether to release the defendant on 
citation.  If the defendant is to be released, PSA provides the officer with the next 
available court date and logs the agreed upon date into the CJIS system.  This compiled 
list of defendants and their assigned court dates is distributed to MPD, OAG, and the 
Court to show who is expected to appear in Court.   

etween the time of the arrest and the date on the citation, the officer must go to OAG to 

paper the case. 

rrest and Bond Release Cases 

efendants arrested and determined by law enforcement officials ineligible for citation 
release may be released on bond pursuant to the Bond and Collateral List promulgated by 
the Superior Court pursuant to the DC Code. The defendants are required to appear in 
Court at a date determined by the arresting law enforcement agency. Defendants are 
brought to the district station house and processed. The defendants’ criminal history is 
searched, including FBI and warrant record checks, to determine if they are eligible for 
release on a bond. If a defendant has an outstanding warrant, is on probation or parole 
supervision, or has an extensive record of failure to appear or escape, he/she is not 
eligible for release on a bond. Based upon the information that is gathered, MPD makes 
the final decision on whether to release the defendant on bond. If the defendant is 
released upon posting bond (e.g. $75 in No Permit case/ $500 in DWI case), and the 
defendant appears in Court, the bond money will be returned to the defendant if the Court 
places the defendant on personal recognizance. In any event, the bond money will be 
returned to the defendant at the conclusion of the case. After the arrest but before the date 
that the defendant is to appear in Court, the officer will bring all of the paperwork in the 
case to OAG and a decision will be made whether to file formal charges in the case.   

rrest and Lock-up Cases 

efendants who are not eligible for citation or bond are held in custody until arraigned.  
Defendants held on OAG and U.S. Attorney’s Office charges generally are interviewed 
by PSA prior to their court appearance.  PSA will provide a report to the Court outlining 
the defendant’s background, criminal history, employment status, as well as other 
relevant information, including a recommendation for release or detention and the 
services to be ordered by the Court.  

apering Cases 

aw enforcement officers go to OAG to paper cases.  Upon arrival, the officer will make 
up the case jacket and present the paperwork to OAG for a charging determination.  After 

  B

  L

 

12

meeting with law enforcement officer and discussing the facts and circumstances of the 
alleged offense, OAG makes a decision whether to charge a defendant and, if so, with 
what offense.  If OAG determines that there is probable cause to charge the defendant, it 
creates an Information and files it with the DCMTCC clerk’s office to formally charge 
the defendant with a crime.     

rraignment 

t the arraignment, the Court formally advises the defendant of the charges filed by 
OAG, and the defendant, with the advice of counsel, enters a plea.  At the arraignment, 
most of the defendants enter a plea of "not guilty." After hearing arguments from the 
prosecution and defense, the Court decides whether to preventively detain the defendant 
or set conditions for his/her release.  If the Court determines that the defendant should be 
released, it may set conditions of release designed to protect the community such as “do 
not drive without a valid permit” or “stay away from an area.” 
  
After the Court makes the detention decision and OAG determines that the defendant is 
eligible for diversion, the Assistant Attorney General serves the defendant with diversion 
paperwork.  Diversion options are discussed in section V.  If the defendant is eligible for 
diversion, the case is continued for a status hearing.6  The defendant then signs a notice 
to appear.  If the defendant fails to appear for the subsequent hearing, the Court may issue 
a bench warrant for the defendant's arrest. 

elease Non-Compliance 

f the defendant violates a condition of release, OAG determines whether to move for 
revocation or modification of the defendant's release status.  If the violation stems from a 
re-arrest (new charge) or an alleged violation of a “stay away,” OAG may request that the 
Court revoke pretrial release and order preventive detention.  The Court, after hearing 
arguments from the prosecution and the defense, decides whether the defendant has 
violated his/her release conditions and, if so, whether detention or continuance of the 
release status with modified conditions is appropriate. 

tatus Hearing 

uring the status hearing, the defendant may elect to enter diversion (if deemed eligible 

by the OAG), plead guilty or request a trial.  If the defendant enters diversion, OAG 
provides the defendant with information outlining the requirements the defendant must 
fulfill to have his/her case dismissed.  If the defendant completes the requirements, OAG 
will dismiss the case.  If the defendant decides to plead guilty, the DCMTCC judge 
determines an appropriate sentence.  If the defendant requests a trial, counsel is appointed 
or the defendant is given the opportunity to retain counsel before the case is transferred 
from DCMTCC to the DC Misdemeanor and Traffic Trial Courtroom Calendar. 
 
                                                
6 More than one status hearing may take place prior to entry into formal diversion.  Some cases are resolved 
after several status hearings, ending with a nolle prosequi (dismissal).

Disposition 

f a defendant completes his/her diversion program, OAG will nolle the case.  The judge, 
in a case where the defendant pleads guilty, must impose a mandatory contribution to the 
Crime Victims Fund6 and may impose a fine, a term of incarceration or a period of 
probation. Probation may include community service and compliance with social service 
referrals tailored to the needs of the defendant.  

. 

DIVERSION OPTIONS 

AG has the sole discretion whether to divert a criminal case from further prosecution.  
Should a defendant’s case be diverted, the agreement is between the defendant and OAG.   
OAG offers a number of diversion options as described below.   If defendants 
successfully complete diversion, OAG will enter a nolle prosequi in their case. 

ubstance Abuse Driving Diversion 

ubstance Abuse Driving Diversion is designed for defendants who committed their first 
driving offense involving alcohol and/or drugs.  The eligible charges are: Driving While 
Intoxicated (DWI), Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Operating While Impaired 
(OWI), Possession of an Open Container of Alcohol in a Vehicle (POCA-Veh), and 
Drinking in Public in a Vehicle (DIP-Veh).  To qualify, generally the defendants must not 
have any prior alcohol related traffic arrests, not be involved in an accident involving 
injury to another person or property damage to another person’s property, not hold a 
commercial driver’s license, not have a minor present in the vehicle, not be charged with 
another offense that he/she cannot post and forfeit (described below), not have failed to 
appear in a case for which he/she is seeking diversion, and must have provided a low 
blood-alcohol sample upon arrest. 

efendants enter an alcohol counseling and treatment program and are required to attend 

classes where instruction is given on the effects of drinking and driving.  Classes can 
include group therapy or individual sessions.  Fees associated with this diversion program 
are paid by the defendant and must be paid prior to receiving the service. The fees may be 
waived or reduced depending on the defendant’s income.  

here generally are three levels in the alcohol counseling and treatment program.  The 
first level is designed for social drinkers and includes 12 weeks of alcohol education.   
 

                                                 
6 Proceeds from the Crime Victims Fund (also referred to as the Victims of Violent Crimes Fund) are 
administered by the Crime Victims Compensation Program and are awarded to innocent victims of violent 
crimes and their families for crime-related expenses (e.g. medical and mental health costs, funeral and burial 
costs, lost wages, and loss of support and services).  See http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/superior/cvcp.jsp.

The second level includes the high risk drinkers.  It requires 12 weeks of education plus 
another 8 weeks of group therapy.  The third level, designed for severe drinkers, involves 
12 weeks of education and another 18 weeks of group therapy.  

lcohol education is conducted by a certified addiction counselor using a widely 
accepted alcohol education curriculum.  The curriculum uncovers various myths and 
misconceptions regarding alcohol and highlights important issues about alcohol’s 
addictive and destructive properties.  One two-hour education class is held per week.  The 
group therapy session is conducted by a licensed addiction specialist or a social worker. 
For each class, the structure is generally the same, including an hour and a half of the 
overall session and a half hour of individual question time.  

he POCA-Veh and DIP-Veh defendants attend a shortened alcohol education program. 

The shortened program consists of three (3) 1 ½ - 2  hour classes similar to the classes 
described above. 

ommunity Service Diversion  

ommunity Service Diversion is designed for defendants who have committed “quality 

of life” and other minor criminal traffic offenses.  Some common offenses include 
Possession of an Open Container of Alcohol (POCA), Drinking in Public (DIP), 
Misrepresentation of Age to Enter an Alcohol Beverage Control Establishment, 
Panhandling, Counterfeit Tags, Unregistered Vehicle, Vending without a License, 
Indecent Sexual Proposal, Indecent Exposure, Urinating in Public (UIP), Speed Over 30, 
and Metro misconduct.  Upon completion of the community service, OAG will close the 
defendant’s case.     

efendants can perform community service through various organizations, including the 

Downtown Business Improvement District (BID) and the Department of Public Works 
(DPW).  Those defendants that are eligible for community service with the BID may 
perform their community service the day following their arraignment.  After they 
complete their community service, they may have their case immediately nolled.  Other 
governmental agencies or local private non-profit organizations can serve as places for 
defendants to complete their community service requirement as well.  In exchange for 
their successful completion of the community service, OAG will enter a nolle prosequi in 
the defendant’s case.   

ommunity Service Diversion is similar for most offenses, but some specific offenses 

may have additional requirements.  For diversion on Indecent Exposure cases, the 
Community Court Prosecutor interviews the defendant to determine if he/ she is eligible. 
If found eligible, the defendant must complete 40 hours of community service within 90 
days.  For speed over 30 miles per hour in excess of the speed limit, defendants complete 
two days of community service and are required to make a contribution to the Crime 
Victims Fund.

Remedying  

he defendant may “remedy” his/her case in regulatory related offenses by obtaining the 
required license and paying restitution in applicable cases.  The eligible charges include 
operating after suspension, operating after revocation, driving without a permit, operating 
a business without a license, vending without a license, and other regulatory licensing 
offenses.  The defendant is typically given 60 days to acquire the license or permit and/or 
to remedy the problems that caused the license to be suspended.  Upon proof to the Court 
that the defendant now possesses a valid license, OAG will dismiss the case.  When 
restitution is required, the defendant must also pay it prior to dismissal.   

ost and Forfeit  

he D.C. Superior Court Board of Judges, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police 
Department and the Office of the Attorney General, has developed a list of offenses for 
which the defendant may post and forfeit collateral and the prosecutor will not continue 
to prosecute the case.   Numerous low-level offenses are contained on the “Bond and 
Collateral List” which was designed to expedite low-level offense through the criminal 
justice system without a conviction for the defendant.  The defendant is permitted to pay 
a certain amount, ranging from $25 to $100 for criminal traffic charges and from $25 to 
$1,000 for misdemeanor charges, and the charge is dismissed without the defendant 
admitting guilt.  

ocial Service Referrals  

ocial service referrals are another diversion option offered by OAG.  Offenses that may 

be eligible for social service referrals include drinking in public (DIP), disorderly 
conduct, panhandling, and POCA.  Referrals are made by the DCMTCC Case Manager.  
The Case Manager may refer defendants to a wide variety of services including alcohol 
and substance abuse treatment, job training, mental health services, medical care, 
material assistance, housing assistance, and/or education.  If a defendant is found to be 
eligible for a social service referral, OAG will ask for a continuance of at least 45 days to 
permit the defendant to take advantage of the appropriate services.  The defendant must 
return to Court on the next status date with proof of his/her participation.  Upon 
presentation of this documentation, OAG may enter a nolle prosequi in the case.   

eferred Sentencing Agreement  

efendants that are not eligible for any other diversion program may be eligible for a 
Deferred Sentencing Agreement (DSA).  In a DSA, the defendant enters a plea of guilty 
to the offense and the Court sets sentencing out anywhere from 6 months to a year.  The 
defendant is given terms in the DSA that he or she must complete before the sentencing 
date.  The terms can include drug or alcohol treatment, restitution, payment to the Crime 
Victims Fund, community service, and completion of a traffic safety program.  If the 
defendant successfully fulfills the terms of the agreement, at sentencing he or she may 
withdraw his or her plea and the government will enter a nolle prosequi.  If the defendant 

  T

16

does not fulfill the terms of the agreement, the government will ask the Court to impose 
an appropriate sentence upon the defendant on the day of sentencing.   

iversion Non-Compliance 

f OAG determines that a defendant has failed to comply with the requirements of a 
diversion program, it is within their discretion to terminate the diversion agreement.  If 
the agreement is terminated, the defendant’s case will be placed on the traffic trial 
calendar for prosecution.   

STATISTICAL REPORTING 

In order to develop performance measures and track progress, the participating agencies 
will collaboratively establish coordinated data collection and reporting mechanisms that 
will allow systemic analysis of the data.  Additional information regarding statistical 
reporting will be made available once these mechanisms have been put into place.  

VII.  CONCLUSION 

The DCMTCC represents the collaborative efforts of the Superior Court, local and 
federal government agencies, service providers and non-profit organizations. The 
problem-solving approach of the DCMTCC fosters innovative and systemic responses to 
the longstanding social, human, and legal problems that have been resistant to traditional 
solutions.
