INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A VERIFIED COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE HOUSING 
CODE REGULATIONS AND SUMMONS TO APPEAR IN COURT 
IMPORTANT  NOTICE: These  instructions  are  not  a  substitute  for  the  advice  of  a  lawyer. 
Landlord  and  tenant  law  can  be  very  complicated,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  address  every 
situation  in  these  instructions. You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  to  help  you 
protect your legal rights. You may also visit the Landlord Tenant Resource Center, Room 208, 
(9:15 a.m. – 12:00 p.m., Monday – Friday) for free legal information. 

 

The Housing Conditions Court is a court of limited jurisdiction.   Every case filed in the Housing Conditions Court 
begins with the filing of   a  “Verified  Complaint  to  Enforce  Housing  Code  Regulations.” A  Verified  Complaint  to 
Enforce  Housing  Code  Regulations  is  a  request  from  the plaintiff/ tenant  that  the  court  enter  an  order  requiring 
the  defendant/landlord  to  repair  the  tenant’s  rental  unit.  If  you  seek  additional  relief  from  your  landlord,  such  as 
monetary relief for the condition of the property,  return  of  your  security  deposit,  or  personal  injury,  you  must  file 
those  claims  in  the  Civil  Actions  Branch  or  the  Small Claims and Conciliation Branch. 

Filing Without the Assistance of an Attorney 

An  individual  person  may  file  a  Verified  Complaint  in  the  Housing  Conditions  Court  on  his  or  her  own  behalf 
without  the  assistance  of  an  attorney.  A  person  who  is  not  an  attorney  may  not  file  a  case  on  behalf  of  another 
person or a business. Corporations and businesses that are plaintiffs must be represented by an  attorney at all times, 
including when the Complaint is filed. 

If  you  wish  to  proceed  without  an  attorney,  the  Clerk’s  Office  can  answer  basic  questions  about  how  to  fill  out 
Complaint and Summons forms, provide  you with an Instruction Sheet describing how to serve the Complaint and 
Summons, and give you other basic information. The Clerk’s Office cannot give you legal advice. You are strongly 
encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney. 

Free Legal Information 

The D.C. Bar’s Landlord Tenant Resource Center is open every day the Court is in session from 9:15 a.m. to 12:00 
p.m., and staffed with lawyers trained in landlord and tenant law. If you do not have your own lawyer, the Resource 
Center may be able to answer your questions about filing a Complaint and Summons and other legal issues, free of 
charge. The Resource Center is located in Room 208, on the second floor of  D.C. Superior  Court Building B, 510 
4th Street, N.W. The Resource Center will help both landlords and tenants who do not have  lawyers.

required to include the defendant’s telephone number and email address. 

4.  Leave the date of the initial hearing blank as the clerk will provide you with that information.  

5.  If you are represented by an attorney, he or she should complete this section, including his or her Bar No. and email 
address. If you are not represented by an attorney, you should complete this section with your information. If you are 
not  an  attorney,  leave  blank  the  areas  requesting  a  Bar  No.  and  email  address.  If  someone  other  than  the  plaintiff

Completing a Verified Complaint to Enforce Housing Code Regulations 

In addition to serving the defendant/landlord with a Summons, you are also required to use the Verified Complaint to

that  what you  write on the  Complaint can  be  read clearly  on  all  of  the  copies  in  black  ink.  If  you  are  not  certain

to Appear in Court for information on how to complete service of process of your verified complaint. 

nstructions for Completing the Verified Complaint to Enforce Housing Code Regulations 

The Housing Conditions Court is a court of limited jurisdiction. If you are seeking an order from the Court requiring 
your  landlord  to  repair  your  rental  unit  or  the  common  areas  of  the  rental  property,  you  must  use  the  Complaint 
discussed herein.  If you are seeking monetary relief for housing code violations, the return of the security deposit, 
property damage due to housing code violations, or personal injury, you must file a separate complaint in the Civil 
Actions Branch or Small Claims Branch. 

A  sample  Verified  Complaint  to  Enforce  Housing  Code  Regulations  follows  these  instructions. The  numbered 
boxes on the attached “Sample Complaint” correspond to the instruction numbers below. 

1.  Civil Action Case Number.  Leave this area blank because the Clerk will assign a case number to you. 

2.  Type or very clearly print the plaintiff’s name and complete address, including the ZIP code and telephone 

number. You may NOT list a post office box as the address.  Use black ink. 

3.  Type or very clearly print the name and complete address of the defendant, including the apartment number, 

suite,  or lot and square number, quadrant (NE, NW, SE, or SW), and ZIP code.  If you know it, you are required 
to  include the defendant’s telephone number. 

4.  Print your name, address, and phone number.  Place a check in one of the three boxes to explain whether you are 
(1) the Tenant, (2) an attorney authorized to verify the complaint, or (3) a person who is not the tenant of the 
property but has the right to demand that the defendant make repairs to the rental unit.  If you are not the tenant 
but are demanding repairs to the property you must explain why you are entitled to demand that the defendant 
make repairs to the property. 

5.  In this section, you are swearing that you believe the landlord/defendant is responsible for making repairs to 

the rental unit and  you must list the address where the court will order repairs (which is likely the same as the 
plaintiff’s address). 

6.  In this section, you are swearing that the rental unit at issue currently contains housing code violations which are 

listed in the Housing Code Violations Addendum which is the second page of the Complaint.  You must complete 
the Housing Code Violation Addendum in order for your complaint to proceed. 

7.  In this section, you must indicate if you believe the landlord is aware, or should be aware, of the violations listed 
in the Housing Code Violations Addendum.  You may check any of the boxes that you believe apply to your 
situation.  Be sure to provide the information requested depending on the box(es) you check (e.g. name of person 
you spoke to if you claim you told the landlord or his or her representatives about the housing code violations in 
your rental unit).  Be as specific and accurate as possible when providing the requested information. 

8.  This section is optional and you are not required to check either box.  However, allowing the landlord to access 
the property or indicating that the landlord may contact you via telephone to arrange a time and date for access 
to  the property may accelerate completion of repairs to your rental unit. 

9.  A notary public or clerk will complete this section after you sign the Complaint.  The Complaint can be 

notarized at the Landlord and Tenant Clerk’s Office for no charge. 

10.  The person whose name appears in blank # 4 must sign the Complaint in this space in the presence of a notary 

public or a clerk working in the Landlord and Tenant Clerk’s Office. 

11.  This important note may apply to you.  If you are not a lawyer in good standing in the District of Columbia you 
could be engaging in the unauthorized practice of law if you are representing or acting on behalf of another 

    I

individual in the Civil Actions Branch for any purpose other than to request a continuance. 

12.  If you are represented by an attorney, he or she should complete this section, including his or her Bar No. and 

email address.  If you are not represented by an attorney, you should complete this section with your 
information.  If you are not an attorney, leave blank the areas requesting a Bar No. and email address.  If 
someone  other than the plaintiff completed the verification of the Complaint, the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s 
attorney must  sign the complaint in this Section. 

13.  Civil Action Case Number.  Leave this area blank because the Clerk will assign a case number to you. 
14.  This is the Housing Code Violations Addendum.  You must complete this page in order for your complaint to 

proceed.  Check all that apply to your situation.  Be as specific as possible when identifying the location (room or 
common areas) and/or nature of the problems with the rental unit. 

15.  If you have additional housing code violations which are not listed in blank #14, list the violations and  their 

location in the space provided. 

16.  If any of the problems listed in the Housing Code Violation Addendum constitute an emergency and pose an 

immediate threat to the health and safety of the occupants of the rental unit, you must file a motion for temporary 
restraining order along with this Complaint in order for the Court to immediately address your emergency 
conditions.  The Clerk can assist you with the steps required to file a motion for temporary restraining order.
