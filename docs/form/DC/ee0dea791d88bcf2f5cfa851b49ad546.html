      <pre>SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
CIVIL DIVISION, LANDLORD AND TENANT BRANCH

Instructions for Serving the Landlord and Tenant Summons and Complaint 
 

Who May Serve:  The Landlord and Tenant Summons and 
Complaint and any attachments must be served by a competent 
person who is at least 18 years of age and not a party to the case.  

heck the second box on the Affidavit and list the name of the 

person served.  Give a description of the person served in the 
specific facts portion at the end of the Affidavit.   

ervice by Posting and Mailing:  Service by posting and mailing 
may be used only as a last resort, after diligent and conscientious 
efforts to serve the Defendant/Tenant personally have failed.  If 
there is a question about service by posting and mailing, the 
judge will decide if the process server has been diligent and 
conscientious, considering the facts of the case.  Generally, a 
judge will find that a process server has made diligent and 
conscientious efforts to serve the Defendant/Tenant personally 
only if the attempts were made on two different days and at two 
different times of day.  For example, if one attempt is made on a 
weekday during normal business hours, the other attempt should 
be before or after normal business hours or on the weekend.   

f you serve by posting and mailing, you must post the Summons 
and Complaint on the premises in a conspicuous place where it 
may be conveniently read, which is usually the front door of the 
unit.  Posting means physically attaching the Summons and 
Complaint to the premises.  You cannot slide the papers under the 
door, stick the papers between the door and doorframe, or place 
them in a mailbox.  After posting the Summons and Complaint, 
you must mail a copy of the Summons and Complaint to the 
Defendant/Tenant within 3 calendar days.  Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal holidays count toward the 3 days.  You must record the 
date and time of all attempts at personal service in the Affidavit, 
including when posting was made, and must record the date the 
Summons and Complaint were mailed.  In the specific facts 
portion at the end of the Affidavit, provide a description of where 
the Summons and Complaint were posted, including the location 
in the building, a physical description of the premises, and/or any 
other information that would help the court determine if service 
was proper.   

ervice on a Corporation or LLC:  Service on a corporation or 
limited liability company (LLC) may be made by giving a copy 
of the Summons and Complaint to an officer, managing or 
general agent, registered agent, or any other person authorized by 
law or appointment.  If there is no registered agent, you may 
serve the corporation or LLC by service on the Mayor.  Contact 
the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for 
instructions. Check the fourth box on the Affidavit if you have 
served a corporation or LLC.  Write the name of the person you 
served in the blank space for the name on the Affidavit, circle 
that person’s title, and give a physical description of that person 
or other relevant facts in the specific facts portion at the end of 
the Affidavit.  If you used an alternative method of service on a 
corporation, indicate the method of service in the Affidavit and 
provide any relevant facts.

ffidavits of Service:  Form Affidavits are available in the 

clerk’s office.  The person who serves the Summons and 
Complaint must sign the Affidavit.  The completed Affidavit 
must be sworn to before a notary public or other person 
authorized by law to administer an oath and must be filed with 
the Court at least 5 days before the initial hearing date, not 
counting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  A separate 
Affidavit must be filed for each defendant.   

iming and Methods of Service:  Service must be made not later 
than 7 days before the initial hearing date, not counting Sundays 
and legal holidays.  D.C. Code §16-1502. 

here are three methods to serve an L&T Summons and 

Complaint: 1) personal service; 2) substitute service; 3) service 
by posting and mailing.  They are described in detail in the 
paragraphs below.  In every case, the process server first must 
make good faith efforts to make personal service.  If the process 
server has made a diligent and conscientious effort at personal 
service and has been unable to serve a Defendant/Tenant either 
personally or by substitute service, then the process server may, 
as a last resort, serve that Defendant/Tenant by posting and 
mailing.   

oney Judgments:  If you are seeking a money judgment in 

addition to a judgment for possession, then you must have 
personal service on each Defendant/Tenant against whom you 
seek a money judgment.  If you do not serve a Defendant/Tenant 
personally, then you may be limited to a judgment for possession 
against that Defendant/Tenant.   

ersonal Service:  Personal Service on a Defendant/Tenant who 

is an individual is made by giving a copy of the Summons and 
Complaint directly to the Defendant/Tenant in person.  If you 
have personally served the Defendant/Tenant, check the first box 
on the Affidavit.  Write the name of the person you served in the 
blank space for the name on the Affidavit and give a physical 
description of the Defendant/Tenant in the specific facts portion 
at the end of the Affidavit.  

ubstitute Service:  If you cannot find the Defendant/Tenant or if 
the Defendant/Tenant has left the District of Columbia, you may 
accomplish service by leaving a copy of the Summons and 
Complaint at the premises with a person of “suitable discretion” 
who is at least 16 years old and resides in or is in possession of 
the premises.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
