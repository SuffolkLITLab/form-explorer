      <pre>SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
 
CIVIL DIVISION 

GENERAL MEDIATION ORDER 

Extensive experience throughout the country has shown that a high percentage of civil cases 

referred for mediation are amicably settled without the need for an expensive and time-consuming 
trial. The likelihood of settlement is increased when all parties to the lawsuit, their lawyers, and all 
people with settlement authority meet virtually or face-to-face for discussions with the mediator. 
The Court has therefore instituted the following procedures for all cases in which the parties are 
referred to mediation administered by the Multi-Door Dispute Resolution Division (“Multi-Door 
Division”).  Sanctions may be imposed on any party or attorney who does not comply with these 
procedures. 

The Court orders that: 

2. 

3. 

4. 

1. 

All parties and their attorneys must appear for mediation in accordance with the 

Scheduling Order entered in the case.  Any party or attorney who believes that he or she has been 
incorrectly notified to participate in mediation must contact the Civil Actions Branch at (202) 879-
1133. Any party or attorney who does not contact the Civil Actions Branch must participate fully in 
the mediation.  Parties not represented by an attorney are not required to get an attorney for 
mediation. 
 

Any party or attorney may contact the Multi-Door Dispute Resolution Division at 

(202) 879-1549 with questions regarding the mediation. 
 

If authorized by the judge, parties may attend private mediation in lieu of mediation 

through the Multi-Door Division. 
 

Each party shall submit to the Multi-Door Division a Confidential Settlement 

Statement in the form attached to this Order, and each party represented by counsel shall submit a 
Mediation Readiness Certificate in the form attached to this Order.  An attorney may file one 
statement and one certificate for all the parties he or she represents, provided that all those parties 
are clearly and expressly indicated on the statement. 
 

5. 

Both the Confidential Settlement Statement and the Mediation Readiness Certificate 

shall be either (a) sent by email to CivilMRC-CSS@dcsc.gov or (b) delivered to the Multi-Door 
Dispute Resolution Division, 410 E Street, N.W., Suite 2900, Washington, D.C. 20001.  A party 
shall not send a copy of either document to the clerk, the calendar judge, or other attorneys or 
parties. 
 

6. 

Both the Confidential Settlement Statement and the Mediation Readiness Certificate 
must be received by the Multi-Door Division at least 21 days before the scheduled mediation date. 
 

 

    

   

 

7. 

If a mediation is rescheduled after a party submits the Confidential Settlement 

Statement and Mediation Readiness Certificate, and if any information in the original Confidential 
Settlement Statement and/or Mediation Readiness Certificate changes, the party must submit an 
updated Confidential Settlement Statement and/or Mediation Readiness Certificate at least 21 days 
before the date of the rescheduled mediation. 
 

8. 

Except in cases involving automobile accidents, the Multi-Door Division will grant a 
request by one party to reschedule a mediation provided that (a) all other parties consent and (b) the 
request is made at least 21 days before the scheduled mediation case.  A party may request such a 
postponement by contacting the Civil Actions Branch at (202) 879-1133. All other requests to 
continue a mediation must be submitted to the assigned judge through a motion. Any request to 
continue an automobile accident case must be submitted to the assigned Judge. 
 

9. 

If the Multi-Door Division does not receive the completed Confidential Settlement 
Statement and Mediation Readiness Certificate from a party 21 days before the scheduled mediation 
date, and if the Multi-Door Division has an email address for the party or the party’s lawyer, the 
Multi-Door Division will send an email reminding the party of its obligation to submit these 
documents. 
 

10. 

If the Multi-Door Division does not receive the completed Confidential Settlement 

Statement and the Mediation Readiness Certificate from each party 14 days before the scheduled 
mediation date, the Multi-Door Division will cancel the mediation and notify the calendar judge and 
the Presiding Judge of the Civil Division, including identifying the party or parties, and any attorney, 
who did not provide the documents. 
 

11. 

If the Multi-Door Division notifies the calendar judge that it canceled a scheduled 
mediation because one or more parties did not provide the Confidential Settlement Statement and 
the Mediation Readiness Certificate as required by this Order, the calendar judge will schedule a 
hearing, reschedule the mediation, or both.   
 

12. 

If a lawyer does not submit the Confidential Settlement Statement and the Mediation 

Readiness Certificate as required by this order, the calendar judge will issue an order requiring the 
lawyer to show cause within 14 days why the lawyer should not pay $100 to each other party to 
compensate each other party (whether or not represented by counsel) for delay and time spent in 
connection with the canceled mediation.  If the lawyer does not show cause within 14 days, the 
lawyer shall pay each other party $100. 
 

13. 

If a lawyer is assessed a $100 payment pursuant to Paragraph 9 more than once in a 
12-month period, the Presiding Judge will issue an order requiring the lawyer to show cause why the 
lawyer should not make a payment into the court registry to compensate the court for time spent in 
canceling and rescheduling mediations and to reimburse the court for compensation paid to 
mediators who set aside time for the canceled mediation.  Unless the lawyer demonstrates good 
cause, the payment shall be $250 for the first assessment and will increase in $250 increments for 
each additional assessment. 

 

Rev. 4.6.2022 

     

14. 

Corporations, partnerships and other business entities must be represented in the 

mediation by an officer, partner, or other individual with full settlement authority, unless the judge 
previously ordered otherwise. WMATA, the District of Columbia, and other government entities 
must be represented in the mediation by a person with full settlement authority, unless the judge 
previously ordered otherwise. 
 

15. 

An insurance representative whose authority may be needed to settle the case and 

who has full settlement authority must participate in the mediation unless excused by the Judge. See 
Super. Ct. Civ. R. 16(j). 
 

16. 

If authorized by the judge, an insurance representative with full settlement authority 

may participate in the mediation in place of the insured party. 
 

17. 

A party or an insurance representative residing outside the local metropolitan area 

who has been excused by the judge from in-person participation must be available by video or 
telephone throughout the entire mediation session.  
 

18. 

The attorney for any party or insurance representative whom a judge has authorized 

to participate remotely must advise the Multi-Door Division of the arrangement before the 
mediation. See Super. Ct. Civ. R. 16(j). 
 

19. 

If the case settles before mediation, documentation must be filed with the clerk’s 

office, and a copy must also be sent to the Multi-Door Division. Attorneys must inform the Multi-
Door Division of settlements occurring before mediation. If an attorney does not inform the Multi-
Door Division of a settlement at least 48 hours before a scheduled mediation, the attorney may be 
held personally liable for the fee paid by the Division to the mediator. 
 

20.  Mediation sessions are confidential. The participants will be asked to sign an 
“Agreement to Mediate” before or at the beginning of the session confirming their understanding of 
the session's confidential nature. Any statement made by any party, attorney or other participant may 
not be used as an admission or otherwise used in court in connection with the case or any other 
litigation. No party is bound by anything said or done at mediation unless a settlement is reached 
and a settlement praecipe is filed with the court. 
 

21. 

During the mediation session, the mediator will meet initially with all the parties, the 

insurance representative, or other government representative and attorneys. He or she may then 
meet with each side privately as necessary to clarify important issues and to allow parties to reveal in 
confidence the factors viewed as critical to settlement. Through a series of meetings with the parties, 
individually and together, the mediator will try to facilitate an agreement that will satisfy the interests 
of all concerned. 
 

22. 

If the case is settled during mediation, a copy of the settlement or other document 

memorializing the settlement must be submitted promptly to the Multi-Door Division case manager. 

 

 

     

Rev. 4.6.2022 

If the parties need approval of the settlement by the court (for example, because the settlement 
involves a minor – see D.C. Code § 21-120), the Multi-Door Division will set a status hearing on the 
Judge’s calendar. The parties are responsible for filing a motion for court approval of the settlement. 
 

23. 

If the case does not settle at mediation, a pretrial conference or other hearing will be 

scheduled by the Multi-Door Division.
