Civil Division 

INSTRUCTIONS TO EMPLOYER-GARNISHEE 

1.  Formula. 

Withholding is generally required if an  employee earns more than 40 times the D.C. minimum hourly 

wage per week – in other words, if an employee works more than the equivalent of 40 full-time hours at 

minimum wage.  When garnishing, the employer generally must withhold 25% of the amount by which 

the employee’s disposable wages for a week exceed 40 times the minimum hourly wage in effect at the 

time.  If the pay period is not one week, the employer multiplies the minimum hourly wage by 40 and 

then multiplies the resulting number by the number of full and/or partial weeks which are included in the 

pay period.  The court may reduce the amount if the employee proves financial hardship. 

2.  Timing and Duration. 

The employer must withhold the specified amount from employee’s wages and pay this amount within 

15  days  after  the  close  of  the  last  pay  period  of  the  employee  ending  in  each  calendar  month,  until 

judgment has been satisfied, or until otherwise instructed by the Court. 

3.  Definitions.  

retirement program; 

“Wages”  means  compensation  paid  or  payable  for  personal  services,  whether  denominated  as  wages, 

salary,  commission,  bonus,  or  otherwise,  and  includes  periodic  payments  pursuant  to  a  pension  or 

“Disposable wages” means that part of any individual’s earnings remaining after the deduction of any 

amounts required by law to be withheld. (D.C. Code § 16-571) 

4.  Calculating the Withholdings Amount.  

To calculate the exact withholdings amount: 

(1) Determine the employee’s disposable wages for the pay period. 

(2) Multiply the D.C. minimum wage in effect on the date wages are payable by 40.   

•  In  the  case  of  wages  for  any  pay  period  other  than  a  week,  multiply  the  minimum  hourly 

wage  by  40  and  then  multiply  the  resultant  product  by  the  number  of  full  and/or  partial 

weeks which are included in the pay period being considered. 

(3) If the amount from (1) is less than or equal to the amount from (2), the employer-garnishee shall

amounts and multiply it by .25. 

ote:  The  District  of  Columbia  minimum  hourly  wage  is  $14.00  per  hour  as  of  July  1,  2019.  Any 

subsequent changes to the minimum hourly wage must be observed by the garnishee. Pursuant to D.C. 

Code § 32-1003 (f-1), any adjustments to the minimum hourly wage shall be published in the District of 

Columbia  Register  and  the  Department  of  Employment  Services  website  at  least  30  days  before  an 

increase is scheduled to go into effect.

termination in the space provided. 

6.  Priority of Multiple Attachments.   

In the event defendant leaves your employ for a period of 90 days or less, and then is reemployed, this 

attachment shall remain in full force and effect, and you are required to resume the withholdings.  In the 

event defendant leaves your employ for a period of 91 days or more, this attachment shall terminate and 

you  shall  return  your  copy  of  the  completed  interrogatories  to  the  Court,  setting  forth  the  date  of  the 

If other attachments against this employee have been served upon you and are still unsatisfied, you are 

required under the law to make withholdings to satisfy the attachments in the order in which they were 

received by  you, before  withholding  or paying anything  to satisfy  this  attachment.  If  you were served 

with  two  or  more  attachments  at  the  same  time,  the  one  bearing  the  earlier  time  stamp  of  the  United 

States Marshal is entitled to be satisfied first. 

7.  WARNING and Legal Authorities. 

Sec. 6 of the D.C. Consumer Credit Protection  Act of 1971 (P.L. 92-200) prohibits an employer from 

discharging  an  employee  for  the  reason  that  unpaid  earnings  have  been  subjected  or  attempted  to  be 

subjected  to  garnishment  for  the  purpose  of  paying  a  judgment.    The  Federal  Wage  Garnishment  law 

restricts  such  discharge  where  an  employee’s  earnings  have  been  subjected  to  garnishment  for  any 

indebtedness and provides that a willful violation of said restriction may subject an employer to a fine of 

not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both.

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
Civil Division 

Notice to Defendant (Judgment-Debtor) Regarding Wage Garnishment 

hy am I receiving this? 

The enclosed Writ of Attachment is a copy of a legal document that has been issued to your employer. 

You are receiving this notice because the plaintiff in this case obtained a money judgment against you. 

A money judgment is a court's decision that you owe money to someone else (the "judgment creditor"). 

The  plaintiff  (or  judgment–creditor)  is  now  seeking  garnishment  of  your  wages.  Garnishment  is  a 

process  in  which  a  portion  of  an  employee's  wages  are  taken  each  pay  period  in  order  to  pay  money 

owed. Withholding continues until the judgment is paid in full. 

ill my wages be garnished? If so, how much?   

D.C. law automatically protects certain amounts of wages from garnishment. For example, if you earn 

40 times the D.C. minimum hourly wage per week or less (in other words, if you work the equivalent of 

full-time  hours  at  minimum  wage,  or  less),  your  earnings  are  fully  protected  against  garnishment  and 

nothing will be taken from your paycheck. However, if you earn more than that, your employer may be 

required to withhold a portion of your wages to pay to the judgment-creditor (plaintiff). The amount of 

garnishment is calculated based on the formula stated on the Writ of Attachment. 

s there anything I can do?  

If you are already protected from garnishment, or if you can afford the amount that will be taken out of 

your  paycheck  to  pay  the  judgment  creditor,  you  do  not  need  to  do  anything.  However,  you  have  the 

right under D.C. Code§ 16-572a to request that the court adjust the amount of wages withheld based on 

financial  hardship.  To  make  such  a  request,  you  or  your  attorney  must  file  a  motion.  You  can  get  a 

motion  form  from  the  Clerk’s  Office  or  online  at  www.dcourts.gov.  In  addition,  there  may  be 

circumstances under which you may be able to ask the court to undo the judgment. If you file a motion 

to adjust the amount of wages subject to garnishment based on financial hardship, you should provide a 

copy of the motion to your employer immediately so that the garnishment can be put on hold until the 

court makes a decision.
