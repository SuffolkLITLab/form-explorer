INSTRUCTION SHEET FOR FORM CA 114, SERVICEMEMBERS AFFIDAVIT
  

The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (2003), 50 U.S.C. App. § 501 et seq. provides that in any 
civil action or proceeding in which a default has been entered by the Court the plaintiff is 
required to file an affidavit “stating whether or not the defendant is in the military service and 
[show] necessary facts to support the affidavit.”  In order to better comply with the requirements 
of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the District of Columbia Superior Court has created 
Form CA 114, Servicemembers Affidavit, and amended Civil Rules 55 and 55-II and Landlord 
and Tenant Rules 11, 14, and 14-I to require the use of Form CA 114 in all proceedings in the 
Civil Division in which a default has been entered.  (Form CA 114 is required in Small Claims 
cases pursuant to Small Claims Rule 2 which incorporates Civil Rules 55 and 55-II).  Please 
note, a separate affidavit must be filed for each defendant named in the complaint and against 
whom a default has been entered.   

his instruction sheet is intended to provide basic directions on how to complete Form CA 114.  
If you have any additional questions about how to fill out Form CA 114 or complete a search to 
determine the military status of a litigant, please consult an attorney or visit the Landlord-Tenant 
Resource Center, Small Claims Resource Center or Tax-Lien Resource Center.  Information for 
the Resource Centers is provided below.

ow to Complete Form CA 114:  

1.  Fill-in name of “Plaintiff/Landlord” and “Defendant” along with the case number on the 

top of the Form. 

.  Type or print clearly the name of the person signing the Form.  That person will be 

swearing to the veracity of the information contained in the form.  

3.  In Section 1, check the (cid:137) indicating whether the person signing the Form is the 

“plaintiff” or the “plaintiff’s agent.”  If that person is the plaintiff’s agent, then indicate 
the relationship to the plaintiff in the line provided.   

.  In Sections 2 and 3, the person signing the Form is swearing that the affidavit is 

completed pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and that he or she has 
“caused a careful investigation to be made to ascertain whether the above named 
defendant is in the military service.”   

5.  If after careful investigation the plaintiff or plaintiff’s agent determines the defendant is 

not in the military service, check the (cid:137) in Section 4, subsection A.  If Section 4, 
subsection A does not apply please skip to instruction #7.

6.  After checking the (cid:137) in Section 4, subsection A, the person completing the Form must 
check one or more (cid:123), indicating to the court the basis for knowing that the defendant is 
not in the military service.  The various options that plaintiffs may use to provide 
evidence of defendant’s non-military status are discussed below:  
a.  The quickest and easiest method to determine the military status of a defendant is by 
conducting an online search through the Department of Defense Manpower Data 
Center (DMDC) at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/owa/home.  For more information 
on how to use the DMDC search engine please see the attached “Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act (SCRA) Web Site” information sheet.  A plaintiff using the DMDC 
must attach a printed copy of the certificate generated by the search engine showing 
that the defendant is not in the military service.  

b.  The military status of a defendant may also be determined by contacting each branch 
of the military. Please see the attached information sheets containing the contact 
information for each branch (also available at http://www.defenselink.mil/faq/pis/ 
PC09SLDR.html.)  A plaintiff using this method to determine the defendant’s 
military status must attach a response from each branch to the Form.   

c.  If the defendant, or one of the defendants, is not an individual then no investigation is 
required and the plaintiff may check the third (cid:123) under subsection A. (Please note, 
however, that if a default has been entered against both a business entity and an 
individual defendant, then the plaintiff must conduct an investigation of the individual 
defendant’s military status and file an affidavit for that individual.)   

d.  The plaintiff, or his or her agent, may determine the defendant’s military status by 
personally asking the defendant and providing the date on which the conversation 
occurred. The conversation must be contemporaneous to the entry of the default.  
e.  The plaintiff, or his or her agent, may determine the defendant’s military status by 

personally asking another individual who has sufficient reason to know the military 
status of the defendant.  If using this option to determine the defendant’s military 
status, the person completing the Form must provide the date of the conversation, the 
name of the individual and that person’s relationship to the defendant, and the reason 
why the individual knows the defendant’s military status.  The conversation must be 
contemporaneous to the entry of the default. 

f.  The person filing out the Form is not limited to the specified options as discussed 

above and may have some other reason to know the defendant’s military status.  Any 
additional reason(s) must be explained and will be reviewed by the Judge sitting in 
the Landlord and Tenant Branch.  

7.  If, after a careful investigation, the plaintiff cannot ascertain the defendant’s military 

status, the person completing the Form must check the (cid:137) in Section 4, subsection B and 
give an explanation of the efforts that have been made to determine the defendant’s 
military status.  If the (cid:137) in subsection B is checked a status hearing will be set by the 
Clerk’s Office for the Court to determine the next course of action consistent with the 
provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   

.  If, after a careful investigation, the plaintiff has determined that the defendant is in the 

military service, the person completing the Form must check the (cid:137) in Section 4, 
subsection C and provide facts supporting the determination of the defendant’s military

status.  If the (cid:137) in subsection C is checked a status hearing will be set by the Clerk’s 
Office for the Court to determine the next course of action consistent with the provisions 
of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.  

9.  The plaintiff may check the (cid:137) in Section 4, subsection D and attach a written waiver 
signed by the defendant in which the defendant waives his or her rights under the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.  Pursuant to Section 107 of the Act, the waiver must be 
contained in a written document, in 12-point type, and signed by the defendant during or 
after his or her military service.  See 50 U.S.C. app. 517 (2003). 

0. In Section 5, the person signing the Form is certifying and declaring under penalty of 
perjury that the information contained in the Form is true.  The Servicemembers Civil 
Relief Act provides that any person who files an affidavit “knowing it to be false, shall be 
fined as provided in title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for not more than one 
year, or both.” 50 U.S.C. App. § 521(c).  The Form does not need to be notarized since 
the Act states that the affidavit requirement may be satisfied by a “statement, declaration, 
verification, or certificate in writing, subscribed and certified, or declared to be true under 
penalty of perjury.”  50 U.S.C. App. §521(b)(4).

Background Information 
Benefits and Features of the SCRA Web Site Detailed Help 
© Defense Manpower Data Center 
 
Below is general information about the nature and purpose of the SCRA web site as well as detailed instructions on 
features. Also carefully read the SCRA Privacy Act Statement and Privacy and Security Notice at 
https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/owa/info.advisory  

Background Information  

The Service members' Civil Relief Act (SCRA) web site is hosted by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), 
an organization of the Department of Defense (DoD) that maintains the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility 
Reporting System (DEERS) database. The DEERS database is the official source of data on eligibility for military 
medical care and other eligibility systems. The DoD strongly supports the enforcement of the Service members' 
Civil Relief Act [50 USCS Appx. §§ 501 et seq] (formerly the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940).  

Benefits and Features of the SCRA Web Site  

The SCRA web site provides an ability to verify whether an individual is currently serving on active duty in the US 
military. The Service members' Civil Relief Act provides important safeguards to members on active duty in the 
area of financial management including rental agreements, security deposits, eviction, installment contracts, credit 
card interest rates, mortgages, civil judicial proceedings, and income tax payments. This web site helps Service 
members verify they are serving on active duty and are therefore eligible for the protections of the SCRA. Historical 
information is not available through this web site.  

Users input required personal data about an individual and submit the query. The web site returns a "certificate" 
stating DMDC possesses or does not possess information indicating the individual is currently serving on active 
duty. There is no charge for the certificate.  

On the certificate, DMDC reports back the personal information entered into the query form by the user; no other 
personal data on the individual is provided on the certificate.  

See "Detailed Help on SCRA Features" below for how information is used in the verification process.  

Web Site Digital Certificate  

This web site encrypts all internet communications between your computer and the DMDC SCRA Web Site using 
SSL standards set by the Department of Defense. Under normal circumstances, SCRA web pages are automatically 
encrypted using a DoD certificate public key. If the certificate is not installed on your computer, you may 
exeperience security alerts from your Browser. The certificate is required to be used to send Privacy Act data in an 
encrypted form across the internet. The SCRA web site is using a standard DoD certificate, but most web browsers 
don't come with the DoD certificates already installed. The best and most secure solution is for the user to install all 
of the DoD's public certificates in their web browser. That can be done by following the Public Key instructions at 
http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html. These are the official instructions provided by the Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA), which handles such security matters for the DoD. For corporations, 
businesses or individuals with a local systems administrator, we recommend that installation of the DoD certificate 
be handled at the IT policy level through coordination with the local systems administrator. Once these certificates 
are installed, your browser should not display security warnings, as the certificate will be recognized by the user's 
browser.

User Access  

Access to the SCRA web site is not restricted. However, the intent of the SCRA web site is to handle individual 
queries by users to generate individual reports.  

Each provided Social Security Number (SSN), last name, and date of birth are recorded with the requesting client IP 
address, Report ID, and timestamp for audit purposes. The application is not set up to handle automated scripts; 
DMDC identifies automated scripts at a threshold of 1000 hits per hour and may reserve the right to turn off access 
to IP addresses generating high traffic levels if these levels would deny access to individual users.  

Alternative Method: Active Duty Verification by Email For historical information, or if you do not have 
sufficient personal information to use this web site, you may verify an individual's active duty status through the 
Military Services. Contact information for each Service Headquarters is listed on this "defenselink.mil" web site: 
http://www.defenselink.mil/faq/pis/PC09SLDR.html  

For general web site assistance, you may contact the DMDC by mail. NEVER send personally identifying 
information via unencrypted email, nor in an unprotected format.

Detailed Help on SCRA Features  

The user interface has two features: (A) a simple data entry / query screen; and (B) a report/certificate page.  
(A) Query Screen Search Criteria and Guidelines.  

1.  Required Input: Enter valid SSN and Last Name, OR valid Last Name and Date of Birth.  
2.  To avoid mismatches, all data must be entered twice.  
3.  Last name is: 
o 
o  matched on first 3 letters if provided with valid SSN  
o  matched on complete name if provided with date of birth but without an SSN (an exact match of 

not case-sensitive  

last name is required)  

o 

listed on the certificate exactly as entered in the query screen.  

4.  First name and middle name:  

o 
o 
o 
5.  Date of Birth:  

are optional  
assist to more specifically identify an individual  
are listed on the certificate exactly as entered in the query screen  

o  must be greater than December 1899  
o  must include four-digit year (YYYY) and month  
o 
o 

is used to help uniquely identify an individual  
is not listed on the certificate.  

6.  Click "Lookup"; the certificate is generated in a new browser window.  

Input must match a unique person in DEERS for DMDC to certify that the individual is on Active Duty. Although 
statistically improbable, it is possible that multiple active duty matches may exist based on the provided information. 
The DMDC cannot provide verification of active duty status in this case. To ensure that this does not happen, 
always provide a Date of Birth if you have this information.

A statement about whether DMDC possesses or does not possess information regarding whether 
the individual is currently on active duty. In the latter case, there are a variety of statements 
possible depending how much information is able to be matched with a DMDC record.  

1) Example 1: "Based on the information you have furnished, the DMDC does not possess 
any information indicating that the individual is currently on active duty." (No other 
information is provided.)  

2) Example 2: "Based on the social security number you have provided, the individual is 
currently on Active Duty. However, the last name, or partial Date of Birth, or both provided 
do not match the individual against whom the social security number is assigned."
