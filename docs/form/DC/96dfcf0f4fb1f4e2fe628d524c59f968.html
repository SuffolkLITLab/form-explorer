      <pre>Superior Court of the District of Columbia    Civil Division – Landlord and Tenant Branch     
Building B, 510 4th Street N.W., Rm. 110, Washington, DC 20001      (202) 879-4879      www.dccourts.gov 
 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A LANDLORD AND TENANT  
COMPLAINT AND SUMMONS TO APPEAR IN COURT 
IMPORTANT  NOTICE:    These  instructions  are  not  a  substitute  for  the  advice  of  a  lawyer.  
Landlord  and  tenant  law  can  be  very  complicated,  and  it  is  not  possible  to  address  every 
situation  in  these  instructions.    You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  to  help  you 
protect your legal rights.  You may also visit the Landlord Tenant Resource Center, Room 115, 
(9:15 a.m. – 12 p.m., Monday – Friday) for free legal information. 

The  Landlord  and  Tenant  Branch  is  a  court  of  limited  jurisdiction.    Every  case  filed  in  the  Landlord  and  Tenant 
Branch  is  a  “Verified  Complaint  for  Possession  of  Real  Property.”    A  Verified  Complaint  for  Possession  of  Real 
Property is a request that the court give the plaintiff a judgment for possession of real property against the defendant.  
A  judgment  for  possession  of  real  property  against  the  defendant  gives  the  plaintiff  the  right  to  file  a  Writ  of 
Restitution, which is a court document authorizing the eviction of the defendant under the supervision of the United 
States Marshals Service.  

If  a  Verified  Complaint  for  Possession  of  Real  Property  is  based  on  nonpayment  of  rent,  the  Complaint  also  may 
include a request for a money judgment in the amount of rent the tenant owes the landlord.  In order to receive a 
money  judgment,  your  process server  must  serve  the  defendant  in  person.   Please  ask  the  Clerk  for  a  copy  of  the 
“Instructions for Serving a Landlord and Tenant Complaint and Summons.”  If a plaintiff only wants to collect rent 
or other damages, but is not seeking an order evicting the defendant, the plaintiff must file a lawsuit in the Small 
Claims and Conciliation Branch or the Civil Actions Branch.  Tenants who wish to sue their landlords must file their 
claims in the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch or the Civil Actions Branch.  Defendants who have been sued 
for nonpayment of rent in the Landlord and Tenant Branch may file certain counterclaims against the plaintiff in the 
landlord and tenant case. 

Filing Without the Assistance of an Attorney 

An individual person may file a Complaint in the Landlord and Tenant Branch on his or her own behalf without the 
assistance of an attorney.  In general, a person who is not an attorney may not file a case on behalf of another person 
or  a  business.    Corporations  and  certain  other  businesses  that  are  plaintiffs  in  Landlord  and  Tenant  cases  must  be 
represented by an attorney at all times, including when the Complaint is filed. 

If  you  wish  to  proceed  without  an  attorney,  the  Clerk’s  Office  can  answer  basic  questions  about  how  to  fill  out 
Complaint and Summons forms, provide you with an instruction sheet describing how to serve the Complaint and 
Summons, and give you other basic information.  The Clerk’s Office cannot give you legal advice.  You are strongly 
encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney.  The Clerk’s Office is not allowed to answer questions about whether 
you need to serve a notice to quit, what to ask the court for, whether you can sue someone for a particular reason, 
how likely you are to succeed, what happens if a tenant pays or moves out before your case is in court, or any other 
issue that will affect your rights.  Those are the types of questions you should ask an attorney. 

Free Legal Information 

The D.C. Bar’s Landlord Tenant Resource Center is open every day the Court is in session from 9:15 a.m. to 12:00 
p.m., and staffed with lawyers trained in landlord and tenant law.  If you do not have your own lawyer, the Resource 
Center may be able to answer your questions about filing a Complaint and Summons and other legal issues, free of 
charge.  The Resource Center is located in Room 115, next to the metal detectors, near the entrance to D.C. Superior 
Court Building B, 510 4th Street, N.W.  The Resource Center will help both landlords and tenants who do not have 
their own lawyers. 

Filing Fees (Court Costs) 

The cost for filing a Verified Complaint for Possession of Real Property is $15.00.  

   

Completing a Verified Complaint for Possession of Real Property 

There  are  four  separate  and  distinct  Verified  Complaints  for  Possession  of  Real  Property.    The  Complaints  are 
numbered Form 1A, Form 1B, Form 1C, and Form 1D.  You must choose one of the Complaint forms depending on 
the type of case you wish to bring. 

a.  Form 1A:  Nonpayment of Rent – Residential Property 
b.  Form 1B:  Violation of Obligations of Tenancy or Other Grounds for Eviction – Residential Property 
c.  Form 1C:  Nonpayment of Rent and Other Grounds for Eviction – Residential Property 
d.  Form 1D:  Commercial Property 

ou are required to use one of these Complaint forms.  It is important that you choose the correct Form and fill it out 
completely and accurately.  Make sure that what you write on the Complaint can be read clearly on all of the copies 
in dark black ink.  The Landlord and Tenant Branch Clerk’s Office will give you whichever pre-printed Form you 
request.  The following pages include information on which Form to choose and step-by-step instructions for filling 
out the Complaint.  If you are not certain which Form to use, you should seek information from the Landlord Tenant 
Resource Center or legal advice from an attorney. 

Completing the Summons to Appear in Court and Notice of Hearing – Form 1S 

In  addition  to  serving  the  defendant/tenant  with  a  Complaint,  you  are  also  required  to  serve  the  defendant/tenant 
with a completed Summons to Appear in Court and Notice of Hearing.  If you do not serve a Summons along with 
your complaint the Court may dismiss your case.  The Landlord and Tenant Branch Clerk’s Office will give you the 
Summons.   

Fill out the case caption with the Plaintiff’s name, address (no P.O boxes), and phone number and the Defendant’s 
name, address, and phone number, if known.  Leave the spaces for the case number and date of the initial hearing 
blank as the Clerk will provide you with that information.   

For Bulk-Filers and Other Individuals Filing Multiple Cases at the Same Time 

In  order  to  expedite  delivery  and  processing  of  multiple  complaints  filed  at  the  same  time,  the  Clerk’s  Office 
requires the following:  

(cid:131)  The Summons must be presented on top of each corresponding Complaint. 
(cid:131)  Present the stack of forms to the Clerk in the following order:  Original, white Summons followed by the 
triplicate,  colored  copies  of  the  Summons,  followed  by  the  original,  white  Complaint,  followed  by  the 
triplicate,  colored  copies  of  the  Complaint.    Repeat  for  each  case.    Please  tear  the  copies  apart  before 
delivering the forms to the Clerk but do not separate the triplicate copies into separate piles.   

(cid:131)  The complaint must be completed with a dark black ink.  
(cid:131)  The individual Complaint pages and Summons must be unstapled. 
(cid:131)  All complaint types should be sorted by type of form before filing (i.e. all Forms 1A together, followed by 

Forms 1B, etc).  

(cid:131)  The Notary stamp must be visible.   

ourt-Ordered Receiverships 

If you own or manage a property that is subject to a court-ordered receivership (for failure to pay utility bills or to 
comply  with  the  housing  code),  the  receivership  order  most  likely  prohibits  you  from  collecting  or  attempting  to 
collect rent.  Therefore, if you file a Complaint based on a tenant’s failure to pay rent, you may be in violation of the 
receivership order.  Generally, a Complaint seeking the eviction of a tenant from a property that is subject to a court-
ordered  receivership  must  be  filed  by  the  receiver,  who  must  join  the  landlord  as  a  party.    If  you  violate  the 
receivership order by filing a Complaint based on nonpayment of rent, your Complaint may be dismissed and you 
may be held in contempt of court or otherwise sanctioned.  See Landlord and Tenant Rule 3-I.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
