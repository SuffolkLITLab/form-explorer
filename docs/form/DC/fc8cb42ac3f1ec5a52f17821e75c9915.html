IN THE MATTER OF 

NEGLECT CASE NO. N-XXX 

FOR ADOPTION OF 
MINOR CHILD(REN) 

 
LIMITED CONSOLIDATION WITH 
 

SAMPLE FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND ORDER 

This matter came before the court on _____________, for a Show Cause 

hearing pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. § 16-304(d) and (e) (2001).  The issues before 

the court are whether the consent to adoption of the mother and father of Johnny  Doe 

should be waived because:  1) the biological parents have abandoned the prospective 

adoptee and voluntarily failed to contribute to his support for a period of at least six 

months next preceding the date of the filing of the petitions on _______________; or 

2) the biological parents are withholding their consents to A.B.C.’s petition contrary to 

the best interests of the child.  

The following persons were present at the hearing:  (1) petitioner, A.B.C.; (2) 

1

   

   

 

   

 

 

 

 

counsel for the petitioner, Patty Black; (3) guardian ad litem, John Rose; (4) counsel 

for the biological mother, Mary Green; (5) counsel for the biological father, Jack Blue; 

(6) Child and Family Services Agency (“CFSA”) social worker, Joan Purple; and (7) 

investigator for the Diligent Search Unit of CFSA, Allan White. 

The court heard testimony from A.B.C., the petitioner, and Joan Purple, the 

social worker.  The following exhibits were admitted into evidence:  four pages from a 

Contact Report.   

After assessing the credibility of the witnesses, evaluating all of the evidence, 

and considering the arguments of counsel, the court makes the following findings of 

1. 

Johnny Doe was born January 1, 1996.  His biological mother is Susan 

Doe.  His biological father is John Smith.  A signed and notarized Biological Mother’s 

Affidavit of Paternity in which Ms. Doe identified John Smith as Johnny's biological 

father is filed in the court jacket.  

If there is reliable proof that you have received a copy of the Notice to 
Mother of Adoption Proceeding and Order to Show Cause and you fail 
to appear, this court may infer or conclude that you have abandoned 
your interest in this child and waived your consent to the adoption.  This 
action by the Court would have the effect of terminating your parental 
rights.  

Ms. Doe was personally served with the Notice to Mother of Adoption 

. 

  3

2. 

The Order directing Ms. Doe to Show Cause stated: 

Proceeding and Order to Show Cause on December 1, 2002.  An affidavit of service 

is filed in the court jacket.  She did not appear at the Show Cause hearing, and 

fact and conclusions of law. 

FINDINGS OF FACT 

 

2

counsel made no representations regarding her absence. 

4. 

John Smith was properly served with a Notice of Adoption Proceeding 

and Order to Show Cause by posted notice after diligent efforts to locate and 

personally serve him were unsuccessful.  Pursuant to the court’s order, notice was 

posted in the Domestic Relations Clerk’s Office for a period of at least 14 days, 

beginning February 24, 2003. Despite the above-referenced notice, no one purporting 

to be Mr. Smith responded to the notice or appeared at the hearings.   

5. 

The court takes judicial notice that the petition for adoption was filed on 

April 1, 2002. 

6. 

Johnny Doe was placed in the care of the petitioner in November 1997 

and has remained with her continuously and without interruption since then. 

7. 

The petitioner testified that Johnny is in good health.  He receives 

regular medical care.  The social worker has visited the petitioner’s home and has 

seen Johnny.  She testified that  he appears stable and healthy, that the home is 

appropriate, that petitioner can provide a loving and nurturing home, and that the 

petitioner is fit and proper to adopt Johnny.  The social worker supports the adoption. 

8. 

Ms. Doe has had very little contact with Johnny since he came into 

petitioner’s care in November 1997.  Ms. Doe has visited Johnny twice since 

November 1997.  She has not otherwise attempted to contact Johnny by letter, 

telephone, or through the social worker.  She has not provided financial assistance, 

other support, or gifts and she has not acknowledged birthdays or other special 

occasions.   

9. 

No one purporting to be the biological father of Johnny has ever visited 

 

3

him or provided financial or other support or gifts, or acknowledged Johnny's birthday 

or other special days.  No one claiming to be Johnny's biological father has ever 

contacted the petitioner or the social worker. 

10. 

John Smith has not visited Johnny; Mr. Smith has not provided financial 

assistance, other support, or gifts, and he has not acknowledged Johnny's birthday or 

other special days.  He has not contacted the petitioner or the social worker.   

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 

1. 

Although the consent of each biological parent is ordinarily required prior 

to an adoption, D.C. Code Ann. § 16-304(a) (2001), the consent of a biological 

parent is not required when the parent “has abandoned the prospective adoptee and 

voluntarily failed to contribute to his support for a period of at least six months next 

preceding the date of the filing of the petition.”  D.C. Code Ann. §16-304(d) (2001).   

2.  With respect to abandonment: 

It is well established that an adoption will be granted without parental 
consent on grounds of abandonment only when the parent's conduct 
manifests an intention to be rid of all parental obligations and to forego 
all parental rights.  Abandonment does not, however, require that a 
parent "leave her child on a doorstep."  Nor does it require that she 
cease to feel concern for the child.  In determining whether there has 
been an abandonment, a court must consider the totality of 
circumstances, including the degree of parental love, care and attention. 
 

In re C.E.H., 391 A.2d 1370, 1373 (D.C. 1978) (citations omitted).  “In order to show a 

termination of an abandonment, the conduct of the parent must demonstrate a 

genuine desire to care and provide for the child.  A mere expression of desire by a 

delinquent parent for return of the child . . . will not suffice.”  Id. at 1374 n.2 (citations 

omitted).

3. 

There is clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Doe abandoned Johnny 

Doe and voluntarily failed to contribute to his support since  over six months next 

preceding the date of the filing of the petition for his adoption on April 1, 2002.  

Furthermore, since November 1997, Ms. Doe visited Johnny only twice.  She has not 

otherwise attempted to contact Johnny by letter, telephone, or through the social 

worker.  After considering the totality of the circumstances, the court concludes Ms. 

Doe's conduct demonstrates that she has no interest in parenting Johnny and has not 

taken the necessary steps to develop or maintain a parental relationship with Johnny.  

Therefore, Ms. Doe’s consent to the adoption is not required and will be waived.  

4. 

There is additional independent evidence of Ms. Doe’s abandonment of 

Johnny:  She failed to appear at the Show Cause hearing despite having been served 

with formal notice that her failure to appear could result in the court inferring or 

concluding that she had abandoned her interests in the child and waived her consent 

to his adoption.   

5. 

There is clear and convincing evidence that John Smith abandoned his 

child, Johnny Doe, and voluntarily failed to contribute to his support since over six 

months next preceding the date of the filing of the petition for his adoption on April 1, 

2002.  Since Johnny has been in the care of petitioner, Smith has not visited or 

provided financial or other necessary support to Johnny.  Indeed, neither the 

petitioner nor the social worker have been contacted by Mr. Smith while Johnny has 

been in the petitioner’s care.  After considering the totality of the circumstances, the 

court concludes Mr. Smith's conduct clearly demonstrates that he is not interested in 

parenting the child and has not taken the necessary steps to develop or maintain a 

 

5

parental relationship with the child.  Therefore, the court concludes that his consent to 

the adoption is not required and will be waived. 

6. 

A court may also grant a petition for adoption without the consent of the 

biological parents when the court finds, after a hearing, that consent is withheld 

contrary to the best interest of the child.  D.C. Code Ann. § 16-304(e) (2001).  A 

determination as to whether Ms. Doe and Mr. Smith are withholding their consents 

contrary to the best interest of the children requires weighing the factors considered in 

termination of parental rights proceedings pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. §16-2353(b) 

(2001).  In re P.S., 797 A.2d 1219, 1223 (D.C. 2001); In re A.W.K., 778 A.2d 314, 325 

(D.C. 2001): 

(a) 

The children’s need for continuity of care and caretakers and for timely 

integration into a stable and permanent home, taking into account the differences in 

the development and the concept of time of children of different ages:  Johnny is eight 

years old.  He has lived with the petitioner since 1997, over six years, and has 

developed a loving and caring relationship with the petitioner.  Since 1997, Johnny 

has had contact with his mother on only two occasions and has had no contact with 

his father.   

(b) 

The physical, mental, and emotional health of all individuals involved to 

the degree that such affects the welfare of the child, the decisive consideration being 

the physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child:  the petitioner appears to be in 

good health.  The petitioner is attentive to the child’s medical needs and she ensures 

that he receives regular medical and dental care.  The child is stable and healthy in 

petitioner's home.   

 

6

(c) 

The quality of the interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or 

her parent, siblings, relative, and/or caretakers, including the foster parent:  The 

petitioner and the child have a loving and nurturing relationship.  The child has had no 

contact with his biological father and very little contact with his biological mother for 

years.  

(d) 

To the extent feasible, the child’s opinion of his or her own best interests 

in the matter.  The child is happy about being adopted by petitioner.  

(e) 

Evidence that drug-related activity continues to exist in a child’s home 

environment after intervention and services have been provided.  There is no 

evidence pertaining to drug-related activity. 

8. 

Having weighed the relevant factors and considered the best interest of 

the child, the court concludes there is clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Doe and 

Mr. Smith are withholding their consents to A.B.C.’s petition for adoption contrary to 

the best interest of the child.  The petitioner is a fit, able, and willing caretaker, and the 

child is continuing to thrive in her care.  Both the social worker and the guardian ad 

litem support her petition for adoption.  Adoption by the petitioner is in the best 

interest of Johnny Doe; accordingly, the consents of Susan Doe and John Smith are 

not required and will be waived.  

WHEREFORE, it is this ________ day of _______________________, 2004 

ORDERED, that this court’s oral findings of fact and conclusions of law made 

at the conclusion of the fact-finding hearing on January 1, 2004, are hereby 

incorporated by reference; and it is 

FURTHER ORDERED, that the requirement that the biological mother, Susan 

 

7

Doe, consent to the adoption of Johnny Doe is hereby WAIVED pursuant to § 16-

FURTHER ORDERED, that the requirement that the biological father, John 

Smith, consent to the adoption of Johnny Doe is hereby WAIVED pursuant to § 16-

304(d) and (e); 

304(d) and (e).
