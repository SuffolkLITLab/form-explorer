ABATEMENT -  INSTRUCTIONS 

LEASE CAREFULLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND THE FORMS CONTAINED 
IN THIS PACKET.  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CONSULT WITH AN 
ATTORNEY.    You  must  fill  out  all  forms  as  completely  as  possible.    If  you  have 
sections where you have left blanks, the judge may reject your form as not complete.   
 

USE ONLY FOR THOSE SUPPORT ORDERS IN EFFECT PRIOR TO 
JULY 1, 2018 THAT PERMIT ABATEMENT.  

 

   

Step 1.  Qualifying  for  an  Abatement.    Wyoming  law  (W.S.  §  20-2-305) 
allows for a temporary reduction in child support when a non-custodial parent has custody of the 
child(ren) for more than fifteen (15) consecutive days. Overnight and weekend visitation with the 
custodial parent during the period for which an abatement is claimed does not count to disrupt 
the 15 consecutive day requirement.  Unless otherwise ordered by the court, child support shall 
abate by one-half (1/2) of the daily support obligation for each day the non-custodial parent has 
physical custody of the child(ren) for at least 15 consecutive days.   

tep 2. 

Claim for Child Support Abatement.   To claim an abatement for 
child  support,  the  non-custodial  parent  must  fill  out  and  file  the  Claim  for  Child  Support 
Abatement with the Clerk of District Court within thirty (30) days after the child(ren) is/are 
returned  to  the  custodial  parent,  and  must  also  pay  the  $10.00  filing  fee  (cash,  certified 
check, or money order).  The Clerk will mail a copy of the Claim to the custodial parent.  The 
non-custodial parent should also submit to the Clerk an Order on Abatement form on which the 
caption has been filled in. The Judge will complete the Order after the time for filing objections 
and responses has expired. 
 

***Failure  to  file  the  Claim  for  Child  Support  Abatement  with  the  filing  fee 
within the 30-day time period will result in a rejection of the claim. 

tep 3.  The  Custodial  Parent  May  Approve  or  Object  to  the 
Claim Within 30 Days.      Once  a  claim  is  filed  with  the  Clerk  of  District  Court,  the 
Clerk will mail a copy of the Claim to the custodial parent at the address on file.  The custodial 
parent may either approve or object to the abatement claim.   
 

A. 

If  the  claim  is  correct,  the  custodial  parent  should  file  a  Notice  of  Immediate 
Approval with the Clerk of District Court.  There is  no filing fee for the Notice.  
The Clerk will mail a copy of the Notice to the non-custodial parent.  Move on to 
Step 5 below.

B. 

If  the  custodial  parent  objects  to  the  claim  (for  example,  if  the  dates  and/or 
amount  of  claim  are  incorrect),  the  custodial  parent  must  file  an  Objection  to 
Claim  for  Child  Support  Abatement  with  the  Clerk  of  Court  within  thirty  (30) 
days  of  the  date  the  Clerk  mailed  a  copy  of  the  Claim  and  Notice  for  Child 
  The  Objection  must  be 
Support  Abatement  to  the  custodial  parent. 
accompanied  by  a  $10.00  fee  (cash,  certified  check,  or  money  order).      The 
Clerk will mail a copy of the Objection to the non-custodial parent.  Move on to 
Step 4 below. 

***Failure to file an Objection to Claim for Child Support Abatement with the 
filing  fee  within  the  30-day  time  period  may  result  in  the  Court  approving 
the Claim for Child Support Abatement. 
 

tep 4.  Response to the Objection.   If an Objection is timely filed, the non-
custodial  parent  MAY  respond  to  the  issues  raised  in  the  Objection  by  filing  a  Response  to 
Objection to Claim for Child Support Abatement within fifteen (15) days of the date the Clerk 
mailed  a  copy  of  the  Objection  to  Claim  for Child  Support  Abatement  to  the  non-custodial 
parent.  There is no fee associated with a Response.  The Clerk will mail a copy of the Response 
to the custodial parent.  Move on to Step 5 below. 
 

***CLAIMS,  OBJECTIONS  AND  RESPONSES  THAT  ARE  NOT  TIMELY 
FILED,  INCOMPLETE  OR  NOT  ACCOMPANIED  BY  THE  FILING  FEE  ARE 
BARRED WITHOUT FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT. 

**Remember, complete all portions of the forms and include the address of 
both  parties,  dates of visitation and calculations for the claimed abatement.  
Forms  lacking  the  required  information  may  be  returned  to  the  party  who 
submitted them.  If the 30-day time period has not expired, you may submit a 
corrected form to the Clerk of District Court. 
 

tep 5. 

Judge will Approve or Reject the Claim.  The Clerk of District 
Court will notify the Judge of all Claims, Objections and Responses and the Judge will resolve 
the  differences  with  or  without  a  hearing.    The  Judge  will  complete  the  Order  on  Abatement 
form  that  the  non-custodial  parent  provided  when  he/she  filed  the  claim.    Once  complete,  the 
Order on Abatement will be mailed to the parties.  If an abatement is allowed, it will be applied 
first  to  current  child  support  due  and  then  to  any  arrearage  balance  owed  for  past-due  child 
support.  The non-custodial parent should note the following: 

Child Support Withheld from Paycheck:  If  child  support  is  withheld  from 
your  paycheck  and  you  are  current  on  your  child  support  obligation,  you  will

receive  a  refund  check  from  the  Clerk  of  the  District  Court  or  the  State 
Disbursement  Unit  for  the  abatement  credit  amount.    If  you  are  in  arrears,  your 
abatement credit will be applied to your arrearage balance by the Clerk of District 
Court or the State Disbursement Unit.  

Child Support Paid Directly by Non-Custodial Parent:  If  you  pay  child 
support on your own (i.e., it is not automatically withheld from  your paycheck), 
and  you  are  current  in  your  support  obligation,  you  MUST  subtract  the  abated 
amount from  your next scheduled payment if you want to receive the abatement 
credit.  If you do not subtract the abatement  credit and instead pay the full 
amount on your next scheduled payment, this may be considered a gift to the 
custodial parent and you may lose the right to the abatement credit.   If you 
are in arrears, your abatement credit will be applied to your arrearage balance by 
the Clerk of District Court or the State Disbursement Unit.

Summary of Instructions:   

on-custodial Parent:  If you have had custody of the child(ren) for 15 or more consecutive days, file the following 

with the Clerk of District Court within 30 days after the children are returned to the custodial parent: 

A.  Claim for Child Support Abatement; AND 
B.  Pay the $10.00 Filing Fee (cash, certified check, or money order); AND 
C.  Submit the proposed Order on Abatement. 

 

The custodial parent will have 30 days to file an Objection, if desired.  If the custodial parent files an Objection, you 
may file a Response within 15 days.   

ustodial Parent:  After you have been notified of the Claim for Child Support Abatement, you may file either: 

A.  A  Notice  of  Immediate  Approval.    Use  this  form  if  you  agree  with  the  information  contained  in  the 

Claim.  No filing fee is required; OR 

B.  An Objection to Claim for Child Support Abatement if you disagree with dates the non-custodial parent 
had  the  child(ren)  or  if  you  disagree  with  the  amount  of  the  abatement  claimed.   This  form  must  be 
filed within 30 days and you must pay a $10.00 filing fee (cash, certified check, or money order). 
 

Both Parties:  After the time period for objections and responses has expired, the Judge will make a decision on the 
Claim, with or without a hearing.  If a hearing is needed, you will be notified of the date and time to appear before 
the Court.  If an abatement is allowed, it will be applied first to past due child support owed, if any, and then to the 
next child support payment due.   

on-Custodial  Parent  please  note:    If  you  pay  child  support  on  your  own  (it  is  not  withheld  from  your 
paycheck)  and  you  are  current  on  your  child  support  obligation,  you MUST  subtract  the  abatement  credit 
amount from your next child support payment in order to receive the credit.  Otherwise, if you pay the full 
amount of your next child support payment, it may be considered a gift to the custodial parent and you may 
lose the right to the abatement credit.   If you are in arrears or if your child support payments are withheld from 
your paycheck, the Clerk of District Court or the State Disbursement Unit will either credit the abatement amount 
towards  any  arrearage  you  may  have  or  issue  a  refund  check  to  you  if  you  are  current  in  your  child  support 
obligation, whichever the case may be.

Date  the  Claim  was  mailed  by  the  Clerk  of  District  Court  to  the  custodial  parent:  
______________________________  

Reason(s) for Objection: 

   Court has ordered that the child support will NOT abate. 
   Non-custodial parent did not have child(ren) for fifteen (15) consecutive days excluding 
weekend  or  overnight  visitation  with  custodial  parent  during  the  period  for  which 
abatement is claimed (set out dates of visitation):  ________________________________ 
______________________________________________________________________ 
______________________________________________________________________ 

   Computation is incorrect.  The amount of the abatement should be as follows: 

A. 

My daily support obligation is: 
(Monthly child support obligation times 12, divided by 365)

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that: 
 

  The  Claim  for  Child  Support  Abatement  is  GRANTED.    The  non-custodial  parent  is 

entitled  to  an  abatement of  child  support pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. §20-2-305 in the amount of 

$__________________ for the period of _______________ through ______________, and the Clerk 

of  the  District  Court  of  the  district  named  above  shall  enter  the  abatement  credit  upon  the  child 

support records.  The abatement may be accomplished by: 

 

If child support is  withheld from your paycheck,  you will receive  a refund check 

from the Clerk of the District Court or the State Disbursement Unit if you are current on your 

child support obligation, or if you are in arrears, your abatement credit will be applied to your

arrearage balance; OR 

 

If you pay child support on your own (i.e., it is not withheld from your paycheck) 

and you are current in your child support obligation upon entry of this Order on Abatement, 

you may subtract the abated amount from your next scheduled child support payment (THIS 

IS YOUR RESPONSIBLIITY).  If you do not subtract the abatement credit and instead 

pay  the  full  amount  of  your  next  scheduled  child  support  payment,  this  may  be 

considered  a  gift  to  the  custodial  parent  and  you  may  lose  the  right  to  the  abatement 

credit.   If  you are in  arrears upon entry of this  Order on Abatement,  your abatement credit 

will be applied to your arrearage balance. 

 

The Claim for Child Support Abatement is DENIED.
