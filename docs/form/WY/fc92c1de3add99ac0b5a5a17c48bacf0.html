OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” litigants.  This packet is often referred to as 
the “pro se divorce packet.”  These packets work best when parties are able to agree and 
become  more  difficult  when  there  are  children,  disagreements  about  property,  financial 
interests,  violence,  harassment  or  coercion.  Many  areas  of  family  law  are  very  
complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming require certain things that others 
courts  do  not.    Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  include  all  legal  solutions  available  to 
people in a divorce action in a single packet.  Again, this packet will be most useful for 
people involved in an uncontested divorce (i.e., you both agree on all matters).  There 
are other types of actions available, including temporary orders on child custody, support, 
alimony and restraining orders that are not included in this packet and might be easier to 
obtain with an attorney.  These forms have been created to  benefit the majority of people 
who  represent  themselves  while  also  understanding  that  people  with  complex  or 
emergency  circumstances  may  continue  to  find  themselves  better  served  by  getting  an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, it is recommended that you find 
an  attorney  to  help  you.      There  may  be  assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.  
Contact the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Legal 
Aid of Wyoming ( 1-877-432-9955) or the Wyoming State Bar (1-307-632-9061) www.wyomingbar.org.  
If  you  have  concerns  about  confidential  information  such  as  addresses  and/or  social  security  numbers, 
please  consult  an  attorney  and  do  not  attempt  to  do  this  on  your  own.  You  should  also  know  that 
Protection  Orders  and  Stalking  Orders  are  available  free  of  charge  at  the  circuit  court  clerk’s  office.   
Please  call  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against  Domestic  Violence  &  Sexual  Assault  for  assistance  in 
obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a 
protection order involving your spouse, you should include this information in the Complaint for Divorce 
or Counterclaim under the “Other Proceedings” section.  
 

   

   

 

 

 

This  information  packet  is  intended  to  provide  general  information  to  obtain  a 
divorce.  
There  is  no  guarantee  these  forms  are  still  accurate  and/or  current.    The 
information in this packet is not intended to replace an attorney.   
If  you represent  yourself, YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You must 
decide which forms apply to your situation.   
DO NOT USE all forms, as some forms may not apply.   
Fill out the necessary forms completely and correctly.   

Print  or  type  all  of  the  documents.  DO  NOT  SIGN  YOUR  NAME  WHERE 

THE JUDGE OR CLERK SHOULD SIGN.

LAWS:    All  laws  and rules  that  apply  to  attorneys  apply  to  you.    It  is  your 
responsibility to properly prepare and file the necessary documents.  The Judge will not 
sign orders that are incorrect or incomplete, nor will the Judge give you legal advice 
or make corrections for you. 

ou  should  read  Title  20  of  the  Wyoming  Statutes  (the  divorce  laws),  and  you 
should also read the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.  Most of the District Courts in 
the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these laws and 
rules  can  be  read.    You  may  also  look  up  these  laws  and  rules  on  the  internet  at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library”.  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks May Not Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Unless your county has a court 
facilitator,  employees  in  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  and  in  the  Judge’s  office 
cannot help you or give you legal advice.   

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte communication is communication with the Judge with only one party present.     If 
you  have  something  you  need  to  tell  the  Judge,  you  must  ask  for  a  hearing  and  give 
notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and send a copy of 
the written statement to the other party. 

ituations  that  Need  an  Attorney.    Federal  law  may  impact  the  division  of 
retirement benefits, employer-provided health insurance, or other benefits which arise out 
of the employment of either party,  and your settlement terms may not be honored by the 
employer or the plan administrator of the employee benefits plan if your divorce decree is 
not properly completed or if a “qualified domestic relations order” (QDRO) is required.  
In addition, in the division of retirement benefits, there may be tax consequences which 
you  may  not  anticipate.    If  your  divorce  involves  issues  like  these,  see  an  attorney  to 
discuss tax consequences or the terms of a QDRO, or, if dealing with insurance issues, a 
“qualified medical child support order.” 

n addition to the above situations, you should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence  
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You or the other party are contemplating filing bankruptcy 
  You  or  the  other  party  expect  to  receive  money  because  of  a  personal 

injury 

  You or the other party own a business 
  You or the other party have significant assets or debts 
  You or the other party own real estate 

ruthfulness.    It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.

You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury). 

nauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those  persons  who  are  doing  their  own  divorce.    It  may  be  an  unauthorized  practice  of 
law  for  a  person  who  is  not  a  licensed  attorney  to  assist  others  in  obtaining  a  divorce.  
Such practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou are reminded that if you choose to continue without an attorney, you are 
expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has said: 
“A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any other 
litigant  and  he  must  expect  and  receive…the  same  treatment  as  if  represented  by  an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

FAMILY LAW INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ONFIDENTIALITY:   If  you have concerns about keeping information confidential, such as 
your address and/or social security number, please consult an attorney.  You should also know 
that Domestic Violence Protection Orders or Stalking Orders are available free of charge at the 
circuit  court  clerks’  offices.    You  may  request  assistance  in  obtaining  Domestic  Violence 
Protection  or  Stalking  Orders  from  your  local  domestic  violence  or  sexual  assault  program  or

you  have  ever  obtained  a  Protection  Order  against  the  other  party,  this  information  should  be 
indicated in the Complaint for Divorce or the Counterclaim.    

ead  through  the  following  information  and  instructions  before  completing  the  forms  to 
make sure you qualify to file a divorce in Wyoming. To file a complaint, either 1) you or 
your spouse must live in Wyoming for at least sixty (60) days immediately before you file, 
or 2) you must have been married in Wyoming and you or your spouse must have lived in 
Wyoming ever since.  You must fill out all forms as completely as possible.  If your forms 
are not complete, the Judge may reject your packet.   

tep 1.  Getting  Started.    The  following  forms  are  required  in  all  uncontested 
divorce  cases.    It  is  recommended  that  you  complete  all  of  these  forms  before  you  file  the 
Complaint for Divorce so that they will be ready to be filed at the appropriate time: 
 

1.  Civil Cover Sheet 
2.  Vital Statistics form 
3.  Complaint for Divorce 
4.  Summons 
5.  Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 
6.  Affidavit for Divorce Without Appearance of Parties

*Other forms may be required depending on the Court and on your situation.  If additional forms 
are needed, they will be discussed below where applicable. 

tep 2. 

File  your  divorce  case.    A  divorce  case  begins  with  the  filing  of  a 
Complaint for Divorce.  A Complaint for Divorce is a written request to the court for a divorce.  
The  person  who  originally  asks  for  this  legal  action  is  called  the  Plaintiff  and  remains  the 
Plaintiff throughout the case. 
 

The Complaint for Divorce is given to the Clerk of the District Court, whose office is 
usually  located  in  the  county  courthouse  or  a  branch  of  the  county  courthouse.    A  list  of  the 
Clerk  of  District  Court  for  each  Judicial  District  is  included  in  the  packet.    You  will  file  your 
case in the District Court in the county where either you or your spouse reside. A case number, 
also called a civil action number, is assigned and an official court file is opened.  Delivering the

Complaint for Divorce to the Clerk’s office is called filing a case.  A filing fee is required.  Ask 
the Clerk what the amount of the filing fee is and what forms of payment are accepted.  

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.”  The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and complaint stating the name of 
the Plaintiff, Defendant, the District Court the case is filed in and the case number. 

A.  When  you  file  the  Complaint  for  Divorce,  you  will  also  need  to  file  the  Civil 

Cover Sheet.  Follow the instructions that accompany this form. 

. 

You  will  also  need  to  file  the  Vital  Statistics  form.    Fill  out  all  portions  of  this 
form EXCEPT the “Decree” section, which will be completed by the Clerk when your divorce is 
final.   
 

You will also need to have the Clerk sign (a/k/a “issue”) the Summons. 

ake the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.  The Clerk 
will give copies of each document back to you after stamping them with the date they were filed.  
This  is  called  a  “file  stamp.”    You  should  keep  one  copy  of  each  document  for  your  records.  
The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Defendant. 

RECAP for Step 2:  To start your divorce case, you will need to file the following documents with the Clerk of 
the District Court’s office located in the county courthouse in the county where either you or your spouse resides: 

a.    Follow the instructions that accompany this form for help completing it correctly; 

a.  Fill out all portions, EXCEPT the “Decree” section, which will be completed by the Clerk

E.    Pay the filing fee; 

                      F.   Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.   

a.  The Clerk will give both copies back to you after file-stamping them.

tep 3. 

Serve the Defendant.  The person against whom the original legal action 
is being requested is called the Defendant and remains the Defendant throughout the case.  The 
Defendant is expected to file an answer to the Complaint for Divorce.  
 

Once your case has been filed with the Clerk, a file-stamped copy of the paperwork must 
be formally given to (a/k/a served on) the Defendant.  The Defendant needs to be served with the 
Complaint  for  Divorce  and  the  Summons  so  the  Court  has  proof  that  he  or  she  received  the 
papers.  A Sheriff must personally serve the Complaint for Divorce and the Summons on the 
Defendant, unless the Defendant completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service 
form.   Other  forms  of  service  exist,  but  these  are  the  two  easiest  methods  that  meet  the 
formal service requirement for a Complaint for Divorce.  If you cannot serve the Defendant

                S

 

by either of these  methods, ask the Clerk for additional forms for alternative  methods of 
service.  These forms are also available in Pro Se Packet 10.   
 

You MUST give the Defendant official notice that you have filed for divorce within 90 
days from the date you filed the Complaint for Divorce.  This is done by serving a file-stamped 
copy of the Summons and Complaint for Divorce upon the Defendant or by having the Defendant 
sign an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form stating a copy of those documents were 
received.  If you do not serve the Defendant within 90 days, your case can be dismissed by the 
Court. 

How to Serve the Defendant.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to 

Option 1– Service by Sheriff  
 

. 
serve the Defendant: 

  A

 

Summons.  It is recommended to have a Sheriff in the county where the Defendant can 
be  found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 
($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).   You can contact the  Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the Defendant lives to determine the fee charged by the Sheriff.  This is also true if your spouse 
is going to be served out of state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff with a file-stamped copy 
of the Summons and Complaint for Divorce to be served on the Defendant. 
 

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called 
the “Return” (or they may have their own form - an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the  original  with  the  Clerk’s  office  and  send  you  a  copy.    If  you  receive  what  looks  like  the 
original “Return” or “Affidavit of Service” from the Sheriff, call the Clerk’s office to ensure the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the Defendant was given proper notice. 
 

Note:   Once the  Defendant  has been served,  you MUST  file the original  Summons and 
Return  (or  Affidavit  of  Service)  with  the  Clerk’s  office  so  that  the  Judge  knows  that 
proper service was made. 

ption 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.  If the Defendant agrees, he or she 
may sign a form stating that a copy of the Summons and Complaint for Divorce were received.  
If the Defendant agrees, you will need to fill out an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 
form.  The Defendant must sign this document in front of a Notarial Officer. 

Notarizing  Signatures.    Some  forms  will  require  you  to  have  your  signature  notarized.    Notarial 
Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, or in many cases, Clerks of Court will be 
willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each Clerk’s office has their own policy so check with them 
first before seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.

Proof of Service.  Once the Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form is signed, 
 
take  the  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  signed  form  to  the  Clerk’s  office  for  filing.    You 
should keep one copy for your records and provide the other copy to the Defendant. 
 

Note:  You must file the signed Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the 
original Summons with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper service on 
the Defendant was made. 

RECAP for Step 3:  You MUST give the Defendant official notice that you have filed for divorce within 90 days 
from the date you filed the Complaint for Divorce.  Choose one of the following methods: 

Option 1 – Service by Sheriff 

A.  Provide a copy of the file-stamped Summons and Complaint for Divorce to the Sheriff where 

the Defendant lives; 
B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once the Defendant is served, be sure the original Summons and the Return or the Affidavit 

of Service are filed with the Clerk’s office; OR 
Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 

A.  Provide a file-stamped copy of the Summons and Complaint for Divorce to the Defendant; 
B.  Have the Defendant sign the Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form in front of a 

C.  File the original  Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service  form  with the Clerk’s office; 

Notarial Officer;  

and 

D.  File the original Summons with the Clerk’s office. 

tep 4.  Wait for  the  Defendant’s  time  to  Answer  to  expire.    Once 
the Defendant is served, he or she has 20 days (if served in the State of Wyoming or 30 days if 
served  out-of-state)  to  file  an  Answer  to  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    You  must  wait  for  the 
appropriate time period to expire before you can proceed with the divorce case.  You must wait 
the 20 days (or 30 days if served out-of-state) even if the Defendant tells you that he or she is not 
going to file an Answer.  

  Computation  of  Time  Limits.  -  In  computing  most  time  limits,  unless  otherwise 
stated, the day the document is served shall not be included. The last day of the time 
period is included, unless it lands on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, if 
the  Courthouse  is  closed  then  the  time  limit  will  be  on  the  very  next  day  that  the 
Courthouse is open.   If you have questions about time limits you should seek the 
advice of an attorney. 
 

•  While waiting, move on to Step 5.  You can also use this time to continue to work on 

the other required forms to be sure they are filled out completely and correctly. 

RECAP for Step 4:  You MUST wait for the Defendant’s time to file an Answer to expire before you can proceed 
with your divorce case.  In the meantime: 

A. 
B. 
C. 

Mark on the calendar when the Defendant’s time to Answer expires; 
Move on to Step 5 while waiting; and 
Use this time to ensure the required forms are filled out completely and correctly.

A.  WHEN TO  PROVIDE:    Initial Disclosures must  be provided to  the Defendant 
(or  his/her  attorney)  WITHIN  30  DAYS  AFTER  THE  DEFENDANT’S  ANSWER  IS 
REQUIRED TO BE SERVED ON YOU (use table below).  Be sure to keep a copy of 
your  Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the 
date  when  you  and  the  Defendant  are  required  to  provide  initial  disclosures  to  one 
another.     
 

1.  Begin  with  the  date  the  Defendant  was  served  with  the  Complaint:  

_____________________________ 
 

2.  Next, determine when the Defendant is required to file an Answer: 

.  If the Defendant was served in Wyoming, add 20 days to the date in #1:  

__________________________ 
OR 

b.  If the Defendant signed an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service, 

add 20 days to the date in #1:  ___________________________ 
OR 

c.  If  the  Defendant  was  served  out-of-state,  add  30  days  to  the  date  in  #1:  

__________________________ 
 

3.  Add 30 days to the date in #2(a), (b), or (c):  ___________________________ 

The  date  set  forth  in  #3  is  the  date  by  which  you  and  the  Defendant  must  provide  your 
completed Initial Disclosures forms to one another. 

  a

 

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

DO NOT FILE THE INITIAL DISCLOSURES WITH THE COURT.  This 

B. 
form is only given to the Defendant (or his/her attorney). 

Step  5.              Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Defendant’s Answer is required to be 
served on the Plaintiff (use the table in 5.A. below to determine date).  The information consists 
of  a  schedule  of  financial  assets;  schedule  of  non-financial  assets;  schedule  of  all  debts  owed 
individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information;  and 
information regarding other income and retirement accounts. 

 

RECAP  for  Step  5:    You  MUST  provide  your  Initial  Disclosures  to  the  Defendant  within  30  days  after  the 
Defendant’s  Answer  is  required  to  be  served  on  you  (use  table  in  5.A.  above  to  determine  date).    Mark  on  the

Step 6.  Once the time for the Defendant to file an Answer has expired and you’ve sent 
your  Initial  Disclosures  to  the  Defendant,  then  several  options  exist  to  move  your  case 
forward to get a Decree of Divorce.  Pick the option that best describes your situation: 
 

Option A. 

If  the  Defendant  filed  an  Answer  or  Answer  and  Counterclaim  and 

you both agree on all of the issues of your divorce, follow option A below. 

ption B. 

If 

the  Defendant  did  not  file  an  Answer  or  Answer  and 

Counterclaim, follow option B below. 

ption C. 

If  the  Defendant  filed  an  Answer  or  Answer  and  Counterclaim  and 

you do NOT agree on all the issues of your divorce, follow option C.   

Option A. The following instructions apply if  the  Defendant filed an 
Answer  or  Answer  and  Counterclaim,  and  you  both  agree  on  all  of 
the issues of your divorce.  If you and the Defendant agree on the issues involved in 
your divorce, then you will need to complete the following: 
 

Fill out an Affidavit for Divorce Without Appearance of Parties. 

. 

Fill  out  a  Decree  of  Divorce.    This  form  will  need  to  be  filled  out  completely, 
signed  by  both  you  and  the  Defendant  and  both  of  your  signatures  notarized.    In  addition  to 
signing  the  Decree,  you  should  also  initial  each  page  of  the  Decree  to  verify  that  each  page 
contains the terms you agreed upon.  
 

C. 

Other  Form(s):    Other  forms  may  be  required  depending  on  the  county  where 
your case is filed.  Ask the Clerk if additional forms are required before your Decree of Divorce 
will be entered. 

. 

Copies and Envelopes.  Take an original and two (2) copies of each of the above 
documents for filing with the Clerk and two (2) addressed, stamped envelopes (one addressed to 
you  and  one  to  the  Defendant  with  enough  postage  to  cover  the  cost  of  mailing  the  Decree  of 
Divorce  to  you  and  the  Defendant).      A  copy  of  any  documents  that  you  file  (other  than  the 
Decree  of  Divorce)  must  be  sent  to  the  Defendant  on  the  date  that  you  filled  out  on  the 
Certificate of Service on each document.   
 

➢  If  a  hearing  is  not  required  by  your  Court,  the  Clerk  will  mail  a  copy  of  your 

Decree of Divorce if accepted by the Court.  
 

➢   If a hearing is required by your Court, follow the next steps:

E. 

Hearing.    In  some  Courts,  a  hearing  is  required  before  the  Judge  will  sign  the 
Decree  of  Divorce.    If  this  is  the  case,  you  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  the 
Request for Setting.  If you have reached an agreement, check the box that states that the parties 
have entered into a settlement agreement.  Indicate how much time you will need for the hearing 
(usually 15 minutes if there is an agreement).  You will file the Order Setting Hearing with the 
Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the 
Defendant.  You will need to provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Defendant 
to the Clerk.  These documents are additional forms contained in your packet. 

. 

Evidence.    At  the  hearing,  you  will  need  to  tell  the  Judge  that  either  1)  you  or 
your  spouse  have  lived  in  Wyoming  for  at  least  60  days  immediately  before  you  filed  the 
Complaint for Divorce, or 2) you and your spouse were married in Wyoming and at least one of 
you has lived in Wyoming ever since.  You will also need to tell the Judge about irreconcilable 
differences in the marriage (why you want a divorce), and why the settlement you reached (who 
gets what) is fair.  

           Give the Decree of Divorce to the Judge.  The Judge may ask you questions.  The 
Judge will not guide you through the hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on the law.  
Following the hearing, the Judge will make any necessary changes to the Decree of Divorce and 
will sign it. 

.  When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge approves the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk.  This process may take time 
if the Judge requires changes to the proposed Decree.    You must verify with the Clerk that the 
Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is final.

Option B. If  the  Defendant  does  not  file  an  Answer  or  Answer  and 
Counterclaim, obtain a default divorce by following these steps: 
 

A. 

Default Divorce.  After the required waiting period has expired, you may obtain 
what is referred to as a divorce by default if the Defendant does NOT file an Answer or Answer 
and Counterclaim to the Complaint for Divorce. 

. 

Necessary  forms.    Fill  out  and  sign  the  Application  for  Entry  of  Default  and 
Affidavit in Support of Default.  Take an original and two (2) copies of these documents to the 
Clerk and the blank Entry of Default.  If your paperwork is correct, the Clerk will sign the Entry 
of Default.  These are additional forms located in your packet.

Additional  Documents.    After  the  Entry  of  Default  is  signed  by  the  Clerk, 
complete  Step  6,  Option  A,  items  A  through  D  above.    MAKE  SURE  TO  MARK 
“DEFAULT” ON THE DECREE.   

. 

Default Hearing.  Some Courts will not enter a Default Decree of Divorce unless 
there is a hearing.  Ask the Clerk if this is required for your Court.  If it is, fill out a Request for 
Setting and request 15 minutes for the hearing.  You will file the Order Setting Hearing with the 
Clerk’s  office  and  they  will  fill  in  the  hearing  date  and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the 
Defendant.  You will need to provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Defendant 
to the Clerk. 
 

E. 

Evidence.    At  the  hearing,  you  will  need  to  tell  the  Judge  that  either  1)  you  or 
your  spouse  have  lived  in  Wyoming  for  at  least  60  days  immediately  before  you  filed  the 
Complaint for Divorce, or 2) you and your spouse were married in Wyoming and at least one of 
you has lived in Wyoming ever since.  You will also need to tell the Judge about irreconcilable

Judge will not guide you through the hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on the law.  
Following the hearing, the Judge will make any necessary changes to the Decree of Divorce and 
will sign it. 

F.  When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk. This process may take time if the 
Judge requires changes to the proposed Decree.  You must verify with the Clerk that the Decree 
of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is final.  The time limit to 
appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed with the Clerk’s office.

D.  Attend the Hearing 

ption C.  If the Defendant Answers or Answers and Counterclaims, 
and  you  and  the  Defendant  do  NOT  agree  on  all  issues  of  your 
divorce, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

You  must  file  a  Reply  to  the  Counterclaim.    If  the  Defendant  has  filed  an 
Answer  and  Counterclaim  for  a  divorce,  you  will  have  a  time  limit  (usually  20  days)  to  file  a 
written response (Reply to Counterclaim) to the counterclaim.  The original, signed copy of your 
reply must be filed with the Clerk and a copy must be sent to the Defendant (or his/her attorney).   

  O

Your divorce is final when the Decree of Divorce has been signed by the Judge and filed by the Clerk. 

•  Caution:  If you do not file the original Reply to Counterclaim with the Clerk 
within the time allowed, the Defendant can seek a default divorce against you 
and may get what he/she asked for in his/her counterclaim. 

B.

Trial.  If there is no agreement, your case will have to be heard and decided by a 

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

C. 

Request  a  trial  date.    You  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  a 
Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  Indicate how much time 
you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your  evidence  and  write  that  in 
(usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether or not you want a Court 
reporter  to  record  the  proceeding.    SEE  BELOW  FOR  DETAILS  ON  GETTING  A  COURT 
REPORTER. It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not get a Court reporter 
to take down everything that is said at the trial.

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and

PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.   
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Defendant (or his/her attorney). 

. 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must  present  the  Court  with  the  agreement  (or  completed  and  signed  Decree  of  Divorce)  in 
writing before the Court will take the trial off of the schedule. There will be no continuances or 
canceling  of  the  trial  date  based  on  telephone  calls.    If  you  need  a  continuance,  you  should 
contact an attorney for assistance in seeking one.  

. 

Court Reporter.  If you wish to have a Court reporter you shall provide notice to 
the official Court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days before 
the  matter  is  set  for  hearing.    You  can  provide  notice  to  the  court  reporter  by  phone  or  by 
submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the mail, the request 
must be received by the court reporter no later than three working days prior to the hearing.  The 
Clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day  notice 
requirement  will  not  be  waived  by  the  Court.    The  notice  is  required  for  all  civil  matters 
including jury trials.   

. 

Evidence and Witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Divorce Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered 
(signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the  information 
requested in that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a 
list  of  your  proposed  witnesses  and  what  their  testimony  is  going  to  be  about  within  the  time 
frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you 
or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 

. 

Final Decision (Decree of Divorce).  Following the trial, the Judge will make a 
decision or may take the matter under advisement, meaning he or she will need to think further 
before making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type 
it into the Decree of Divorce incorporating the Judge’s decision.

A NOTE ABOUT MARITAL vs. NON-MARITAL ASSETS AND DEBTS 
 

In the following tables you will be asked to distinguish marital property/debt from non-marital 
(separate) property/debt.  Marital property/debt will be divided between you and your spouse as 
part of the divorce; non-marital property/debt usually will not be divided (depending on the 
situation). 

he general rule is that marital property and debt is any property or debt acquired during the 
marriage for the benefit of the marriage, regardless of who paid for it or whose name is on it. 
However, just because a party acquired property before marriage does not necessarily mean that 
it won’t be considered marital property. A spouse's premarital separate property can become 
marital when a married couple demonstrates an intent, through their words or actions during 
marriage, to treat one spouse's separate property as marital property. Gifts and inheritances are 
generally separate property, although gifts for the benefit of the marriage, such as a dishwasher, 
may be considered marital property. 

During the marriage" generally means from the time of marriage until the time of separation. 

eople often dispute what property/debt is marital or how long the marriage lasted. When this 
happens, you are urged to consult with an attorney to learn about the various legal arguments that 
may be available to you.
