abouT WaM

After operating in several organizational forms since 1928, the 
Wyoming Association of Municipalities (WAM) was incorporated in 
1967 as a non-profit, non-partisan organization representing and 
serving Wyoming’s cities and towns.  Every Wyoming citizen relies 
on quality services and facilities provided by cities and towns. This 
is especially true as 69 percent of Wyoming’s population lives in a 
municipality.

WAM’s mission is to advocate for cities’ and towns’ common interest 
and provide educational opportunities for WAM members.

WAM is governed by a Board of Directors composed of mayors, 
council members, and representatives from Great Open Spaces 
City Management Association (GOSCMA), Wyoming Association of 
Municipal Clerks and Treasurers (WAMCAT) and Leadership Training 
Services (LTS).

WAM OBJECTIVES:
• 

• 

• 

 ADVOCATE for Wyoming’s cities’ and towns’ municipal     
interests regarding both state and federal legislation. 

Provide TRAINING opportunities to municipal officials and 
staff through the Local Government Leadership Program, 
which assists Wyoming communities with fundamental 
training.

 COMMUNICATE all things related to municipal 
governance, training, outreach and advocacy. Contact 
WAM to discover all the ways it keeps its members and 
stakeholders informed.

811 is the phone number you call before digging to 
protect yourself and others from unintentionally hitting 
underground utility lines. There are millions of miles of 
buried utilities beneath the surface of the earth that are vital 
to everyday living like water, electricity and natural gas.

811 is the federally designated call before you dig 
number that helps homeowners and professionals avoid 
damaging these vital utilities. When you make the free call to 
811 a few days before you dig, you’ll help prevent unintended 
consequences such as injury to you or your family, damage 
to your property, utility service outages to the entire 
neighborhood and potential fines and repair costs.
