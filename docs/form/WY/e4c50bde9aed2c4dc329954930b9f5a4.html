      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MOTION TO TERMINATE GUARDIANSHIP OF A 
MINOR CHILD 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and are not meant to be legal 
advice about your specific case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you must follow the same 
procedures and rules as an attorney. 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

1.  You will file these documents in the existing guardianship file, under the same case 

number.  You can find a directory of the District Courts here: 
https://www.courts.state.wy.us/district-courts/district-court-locations/. 

2.  The Court appointed a Guardian for your child because it found that it was in the best 
interests of your child at that time, and that, unless you consented to the guardianship, 
that you were unwilling or unable to care for your child.  You must be prepared to testify 
and give enough evidence to convince the judge that you are now able to care for your 
child.    

3.  You can read Frequently Asked Questions on pages 8-11, or access Common 

Questions about Guardianship for a Minor at  
http://www.legalhelpwy.org/index.php/get-legal-help/self-help-2/family-
law/guardianships/guardianship-of-a-minor-child/common-questions/ .  These may help 
you to better understand the Guardianship process.  

4.  For additional information, please review Wyoming Statutes 3-1-101 through 3-2-303. 

 

COMMON TERMS 

1.  “Movant” is the person filing the Motion to Terminate Guardianship.   
2.  “Respondent” is the person responding to the Motion to Terminate Guardianship. 
3.  “Guardian” means a person who has been appointed by the court to exercise the powers 
granted by the court. The term includes a plenary (full), limited, emergency and standby 
guardian, but does not include a Guardian Ad Litem.  

4.  “Ward” means an individual for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed by 

the court. In this case, it will be the minor child or children. 

5.  “Minor” means a child under the age of 18 that has not been emancipated.   
6.  “Order” means the official decree signed by the judge.  If the Guardianship is terminated, 
the Judge will issue an Order Terminating Guardianship.  You will want to keep this 
document handy at all times, to prove that you now have legal authority over the 
child/children, and not the previous Guardian.

FEES 

FORMS 

There is no filing fee to file a Motion to Terminate Guardianship in Wyoming, however, there 
may be other costs or fees.  See the Frequently Asked Questions section below for more 
information on various fees.    

Read these instructions carefully to determine what forms you may need. You may not need all 
of the listed forms. Check with the District Court Clerk where you plan to file your case to 
determine if they have any special requirements. You can find a directory of the District Courts 
at: https://www.courts.state.wy.us/district-courts/district-court-locations/ . 

TEPS TO FILING YOUR CASE 

Step 1: Complete the Forms. 

  S

Before you file, make sure that you make copies of all the forms listed. NOTE: You can only use 
the forms for more than one child if the children have the SAME parents.  If they have different 
parents, you MUST file separate forms. 

•  Summons and Return 

  This completed form will need to be served upon the current guardian or 

guardians of the minor child/children.  

  You must provide a file-stamped copy of the Motion to Terminate Guardianship 

for each person that will be served. See below in the Frequently Asked 
Questions section for more information on “service.” 

•  Motion to Terminate Guardianship 

  Complete and sign the Motion.  Make as many copies of the Motion as there are 

Summons to be served.   

Step 2: You are Ready to File your Papers with the Court. 

Provide the Court with the documents completed as described in Step 1 above.  You will need to 
make copies of the documents for each of the following persons (Interested Persons) and give 
them notice of the filing (see below for how to serve): 

Instructions for Termination of Guardianship (Minor) 
Approved by Wyoming Supreme Court (2016) 
Page 2 of 11 

a.  The current guardian or guardians of the minor child/children, and other interested 

b.  The other parent of the minor child/children that is not joining you in this Motion 

to Terminate Guardianship.  

persons.   

 

Step 3:  Notice to current Guardian or Guardians of the minor child/children and Other 
Interested Persons, if any. 

If you know where the Guardian(s) or other interested persons (above) are located, you will 
need  to  have  them  served.   Service  is  required  for  the  Motion  to  Terminate  Guardianship 
and  Summons  so  the  Court  has  proof  that  the  other  party  received  the  papers.   Personal 
service of the Motion to Terminate Guardianship and Summons are required to be made on the 
Respondent by a Sheriff, unless the Respondent completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance 
of Service form.  Other forms of service exist, but these are the two easiest methods that meet the 
formal  service  requirement  for  termination  of  a  guardianship.   If  you  cannot  serve  the 
Respondent by either of these methods, you may request alternative methods of service, such as 
service by publication, in limited circumstances. 

You MUST give all parties in the case official notice that you have filed the Motion to Terminate 
Guardianship.  See below in the Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on 
service. In addition to copies of the above forms, you will also need to prepare this form: 

•  Return (second page of the Summons) 

  This document must be filled out by the sheriff or process server who serves the 

Motion upon the guardians and/or other interested persons. It must be notarized or 
signed by the District Court Clerk and filed with the District Court Clerk after 
service is completed. 

OR  

You can avoid paying for personal service if the guardian(s) and/or other interested persons 
agree to the service.  Each person who agrees must complete the following form:  

•  Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form 

  This form may be signed by the guardian(s) or other interested person who is 
required to receive notice of the filing of the Motion.  If the Guardian or other 
person agrees, you will not need to have the Summons and Motion formally 

Instructions for Termination of Guardianship (Minor) 
Approved by Wyoming Supreme Court (2016) 
Page 3 of 11 

served on him or her. See the Frequently Asked Questions section below for 
more information on “service.”   

  You must still provide file-stamped copies of the Summons and Motion to the 

guardian(s) or other interested person even if they accept service with this form. 

  If the guardian or other interested person signs this form, it must be signed in the 

presence of a Court Clerk or Notarial Officer (Notary Public); 

 

OR 

If you do not have a current address for the guardian or other interested persons, or if their 
identity is not known and cannot be found with reasonable efforts (diligence), you must publish 
the notice of the motion in the newspaper.  You will have to prove to the court that you tried to 
locate the person. You should look in the phone book, search the internet and Facebook, contact 
prior employers, family, friends, etc. to locate a current address.  You will need these forms:  

•  Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  If you do not know how to locate the guardian or other interested person, you will 

need to complete this form and the next two forms.   

  You must detail the efforts you made to obtain an address. 

•  Order for Service by Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  Fill out the top part of this form. The Judge will sign and date the order. 

•  Notice of Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  Complete this form and have it published for four (4) consecutive weeks in a 

newspaper of general circulation in the county where the hearing is to be held. 

  Do not sign where the District Court Clerk needs to sign. The Clerk must sign 

the Notice of Publication BEFORE you take it to the newspaper.   

•  Affidavit Following Service by Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  You will complete this form after you have published the notice in the newspaper 
for four (4) consecutive weeks, and obtained an Affidavit of Publisher from the 
newspaper.

Step 4: Wait for the Answer Period to Expire. 

Once the guardian(s) and/or other interested persons have been properly served, you must wait 
for the answer period to expire.  If the other party was personally served or acknowledged 
service, he or she has 20 days to respond, or 30 days if served out of state.  If the other party 
was served by publication, he or she has 30 days after the last day of publication to respond.  
Once the time to file an Answer has expired, you can move forward with your case.  

tep 5: Default.  

  S

If the guardian(s) or other interested persons were served, but did not sign a notarized Consent or 
did not respond to the Motion, then you will want to have the District Court Clerk enter a default 
into the case record before the hearing. You should prepare and file these forms with the District 
Court Clerk: 

•  Affidavit in Support of Default 

  This form must be signed by the Movant in the presence of a Court Clerk or 

Notarial Officer (Notary Public). 

•  Motion for Entry of Default 

  Make sure you give the correct date when the Guardian was served or signed the 

affidavit acknowledging service. 

  If you know the Guardian’s address, you must give it to the District Court Clerk, 

along with a pre-addressed, stamped envelope. 

•  Entry of Default 

 

Step 6: Ask for a Hearing Date 

It is almost certain that if the Guardian does not agree to terminate the guardianship, that the 
Court will require a hearing.  The District Court Clerk or Judge’s office will tell you if a hearing 
is required.  DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE HEARING WILL BE SCHEDULED 
AUTOMATICALLY.  Once the answer period has expired (see above), you will have to 
formally request a hearing date from the Court.  

Instructions for Termination of Guardianship (Minor) 
Approved by Wyoming Supreme Court (2016) 
Page 5 of 11 

Your Court may have forms to request a hearing date, or you can fill out these forms to request a 
hearing date: 

  The District Court Clerk or Judicial Assistant will fill in the date, time and 

courtroom/Judge for the hearing. 

  You must send a copy of the Order Setting Hearing to all interested parties who 
consent or respond, Guardian ad Litem, or anyone else required by the Judge.  

  You will probably need to send the Order Setting Hearing to:  

  Any legal guardians or interested persons who consented to the Motion 

(although they do not need to attend the hearing); 

  Any other interested persons who responded to the Motion and do not 

have an entry of default against them (see above);  

  Any Guardian ad Litem assigned to the case; and  

  Any other person required by the Judge or Court. 

NOTE: Individual courts have different policies on scheduling, so it is important to contact the 
court where your case is filed to determine when and how to schedule your appearance in front 
of the Judge. 

Pretrial Disclosures. If someone responded to the Motion and is objecting to the termination, 
you will need to prepare your evidence in advance.  See below for more information about the 
evidence you should present at the hearing.  Prior to the hearing, the Judge may order that you 
send a list of your witnesses and other evidence to the Court and other parties to the case a 
certain number of days before the hearing or by a specific date.  If you do not follow these 
instructions, the Judge may not allow you to use your witnesses or other evidence. You can use 
this form to prepare your evidence lists for the other parties:

  Fill in the information at the top of the first page. The names, case number and court 
information should match the information on the Motion to Terminate Guardianship. 

  Enter the names and contact information for any witnesses in the first table on page 4. 

  For each witness, check whether you expect to use them or if you will only use them 

if necessary. 

  In the second table, enter a name for each piece of evidence (“Document or Exhibit”) 
you might want to show the court.  Example: “Exhibit A: Ward’s Medical Records.” 

  Enter a short description (“Summary of Evidence”) for each piece of evidence.

  Sign the Pretrial Disclosures form. 

  Complete the Certificate of Service section on the same day you file the document. 

  Make at least two copies of the completed form (one for yourself and one for the 

Respondent).  Hand deliver, fax, or use first class mail to send a copy of the Pretrial 
Disclosures to the Respondent.  If the Respondent has a lawyer, you would send the 
Pretrial Disclosures to his or her lawyer instead.   

Regardless of whether anyone objects or not, you will need to complete this form to bring to the 
hearing: 

•  Order on Motion to Terminate Guardianship 

  The Judge will fill out and sign this form, or you may be asked to fill out the 

Order after the hearing.  Complete only the top portion (case name and number) 
of this form before the hearing.  

  Bring it to the court hearing and present it to the Judge or District Court Clerk 

when he or she requests it.   

You will also want to prepare your evidence.  See below for information about the evidence you 
should bring to your hearing.

tep 8: Prepare for the Hearing. 

  S

Step 9: The Hearing 

You must appear at the hearing and should be prepared to present evidence as to why the 
guardianship should be terminated, even if no one has objected. 

a.  Be prepared to take notes. 

b.  You must prove to the Court that you are now a fit parent to care for your child.  Be 

prepared to offer exhibits such as proof of employment, stable housing, medical records, 
social services records, and testimony of witnesses such as friends, family, or medical or 
mental health professionals.  Be prepared to show what has changed in your life since the 
Guardianship was put in place.   

Step 10: After the Hearing 

1.  A copy of the Order must be sent to all interested persons.  After the Order is entered, the 

District Court Clerk will send a copy to all parties including:  

a.  Any guardians or other interested persons who consented to the motion (even if they 

did not attend the hearing); 

b.  Any guardians or other interested persons who received notice of the motion and do 

not have an Entry of Default against them (see above);  

c.  Any Guardian ad Litem assigned to the case; and  

d.  Any other person required by the Judge or Court. 

 

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: 

1.  What is “Service” in a Guardianship? 

When you are involved in a court case, you are responsible for delivery (service) of copies of 
important papers you file with the court to other people involved in the case (like the Minor’s 
current legal guardian, or other interested persons, for example).  Depending on the 
circumstances, the papers must be served by personal delivery (called personal service), or if 
the person agrees, they can waive personal delivery with a notarized statement.  In limited 
circumstances, you may be allowed to serve by publishing a notice in a newspaper or by 
registered mail.  Service lets these people know that you are asking the court to terminate the 
guardianship, and the date and time when the Guardian must respond to your request.

Page 8 of 11 

2.  How to Serve the Guardian.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to serve each 

party: 

Option 1– Service by Sheriff  

Summons.    It  is  recommended  to  have  a  Sheriff  in  the  county  where  the  Guardian  can  be 
found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 
($50.00)  dollars  in  Wyoming).      You  can  contact  the  Sheriff’s  department  in  the  county 
where the Guardian lives to determine the fee charged by the Sheriff.  This is also true if the 
Guardian is going to be served in a different state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff with 
a file-stamped copy of the Summons and Motion to be served on the Guardian. 

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s Office will complete the last page of the Summons called the 
“Return” (or they may have their own form - an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the original with the District Court Clerk’s office and send you a copy.  If you receive what 
looks  like  the  original  “Return”  or  “Affidavit  of  Service”  from  the  Sheriff,  call  the  District 
Court  Clerk’s  office  to  make  sure  the  original  has  been  filed.    If  it  has  not,  then  file  the 
original with the District Court Clerk’s office and keep a copy for yourself.  This is the proof 
that the guardian(s) and/or other interested persons were given proper notice. 

Note:    Once  the  Guardian  has  been  served,  you  MUST  file  the  original  Summons  and  the 
original  Return  (or  Affidavit  of  Service)  with  the  District  Court  Clerk’s  office  so  that  the 
Judge knows that proper service was made. 

Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.   

If the  Guardian  agrees,  he or  she may sign  a  form  stating  that  a  copy of  the  Summons and 
Motion were received.  If the Guardian agrees, you will need to fill out an Acknowledgement 
and Acceptance of Service form.  The Guardian must sign this document in front of a Court 
Clerk or Notarial Officer (Notary Public).  

Proof  of  Service.    Once  the  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  is  signed, 
take the original and two (2) copies of the signed form to the District Court Clerk’s office for 
filing.    You  should  keep  one  copy  for  your  records  and  provide  the  other  copy  to  the 
Guardian. 

Note:    You  must  file  the  signed  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  and  the 
original Summons with the District Court Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper 
service was made on the Guardian.

Page 9 of 11 

Option 3 – Service by publication if you cannot find the Guardian.   

If  you  were  unable  to  serve  the  Guardian  either  by  the  Sheriff  or  by  obtaining  an 
Acknowledgement  or  Acceptance  of  Service,  then  you  may  make  a  request  to  serve  the 
Guardian(s) and/or other interested persons by publication.  (Forms available in Packet 18) 

There  are  additional  fees  for  service  by  publication  and  it  will  take  more  time.    If  you  are 
unsure  whether  or  not  you  are  allowed  to  serve  the  Guardian  by  publication,  you  need  to 
consult with a lawyer.  However, if can demonstrate that you have made every effort to find 
the  Guardian’s  address,  completely  fill  out  a  Motion  and  Affidavit  to  Allow  Service  by 
Publication and Notice of Publication.   

After  the  District  Court  Clerk  signs  and  files  the  Notice  of  Publication,  it  is  your 
responsibility to contact the appropriate newspaper and to arrange for the publication and pay 
the appropriate fees.  An appropriate newspaper is one that has been regularly issued at least 
once each week for a period of fifty-two (52) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the first 
publication  of  notice  or  advertisements.    It  must  have  a  paid  circulation  of  at  least  five 
hundred (500) and  each  page must not  be less than  ten  (10) inches by twelve  and one-half 
inches in size.  The newspaper must publish the notice once a week for four (4) consecutive 
weeks. 

Proof of Service.  The other party will have thirty (30) days after the last date of publication 
to  file  a  written  Answer  to  your  Motion.    After  the  thirty  (30)  day  waiting  period,  fill  out, 
sign  and  notarize  the  Affidavit  Following  Service  by  Publication.   You  must  also  attach  an 
Affidavit of Publisher, which is a  form the newspaper  will prepare  and send to  you  after it 
completes the publishing.   

Note:  You  must  file  the  Affidavit  Following  Service  by  Publication  and  the  Affidavit  of 
Publisher  with  the  Court  so  that  the  Judge  knows  that  proper  service  was  made  on  the 
Guardian(s) and/or other interested persons.   

3.  Who can serve? 

 

Ask a private process server, or a representative of the county sheriff’s civil division, to 
personally serve copies of the forms to the persons named above.  The forms cannot be sent 
by mail.  You will have to pay this person for his or her services. The District Court Clerk in 
the county where you need to make service may have a list of local process servers.

Page 10 of 11 

4.  What if I cannot locate one or both of the Guardians or he or she is avoiding service of 

process? 

You will have to publish notice of the hearing in the newspaper in the county where you have 
filed the Motion.  See information above for forms and instructions on service by publication. 

5.  What if one or both of the Guardians do not agree to terminate the guardianship? 

If the Guardians do not agree, then the Court will most likely schedule a court hearing where 
you will present your evidence as to why the guardianship is no longer necessary.  At the 
hearing, you will be given a chance to show the judge why a guardianship is not necessary, 
and to demonstrate your fitness as a parent.  If a hearing is scheduled, you should consult 
with an attorney.  

6.  What if the Guardian(s) give her/his consent to terminate the guardianship? 

If the Guardian gives consent to terminate the guardianship, then you may not need a 
hearing.  However, some Judges may still require a hearing.    

7.  What if I previously consented to the guardianship (temporary or permanent), and then 
my circumstances have changed and I now believe I can care for my child/children?  

You, as the parent, have the right to ask for your child back at any time, unless your parental 
rights have been terminated.  However, the Guardian has legal custody of the child until the 
guardianship end date (usually when the child turns 18 for a permanent guardianship) or until 
the Court says otherwise.  If the term for the guardianship has not ended, you will have to 
file a Motion to Terminate Guardianship to ask the court to set aside the guardianship.  The 
Court will most likely set a hearing on the matter.  Be sure that the Court always has your 
current address and phone numbers at all times, and read all mail you may get from the 
Court, and follow any instructions carefully and on time.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
