INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN – MINOR 
 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and are not meant to be legal 
advice about your specific case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you must follow the same 
procedures and rules as an attorney. 

ENERAL INFORMATION 

1.  Usually, you must file a guardianship case in the District Court in the county where the 

child lives.  BUT, if there is already a child custody case with orders affecting the child in 
another county, you MUST file the guardianship petition in that same county and court 
where the custody orders exist.  That way, there will not be two different courts issuing 
custody orders about the minor that could conflict with each other.  You can find a 
directory of the District Courts here: https://www.courts.state.wy.us/district-
courts/district-court-locations/ 

2.  Any person may file the case.  NOTE: If you are the biological or adoptive parent (legal 

parent) of the minor child, these forms are not for you.  If you are responding to a 
guardianship petition, there is a separate packet available.  If you want to terminate (end) 
a guardianship, you would need to file a Motion to Terminate Guardianship.  If you are 
the child’s biological parent and you are seeking custody and visitation from the other 
biological or adoptive parent, you would need to file a Petition to Establish Custody or 
Paternity.  

3.  If the Minor has a large amount of income or assets, such as real estate or stocks, you 
may also need to file for conservatorship in order to manage the money or assets.  

4.  The Court may appoint a Guardian for a child if the Court finds the appointment would 
be in the best interests of the child. If there is a living parent (or parents) and he or she 
still has parental rights but has not agreed (consented) to the guardianship, then you must 
also prove to the Court that the parent is unwilling or unable to care for his or her child. 
The person requesting the guardianship must be prepared to testify and give enough 
evidence to prove that the parents are unfit, not just that the person asking to be guardian 
would be a better caregiver, and that the guardianship is in the child’s best interest.  

5.   You can read Frequently Asked Questions on pages 11-14, or access Common 

Questions about Guardianship for a Minor at  
http://www.legalhelpwy.org/index.php/get-legal-help/self-help-2/family-
law/guardianships/guardianship-of-a-minor-child/common-questions/ .  These may help 
you to better understand the Guardianship process.  
 

6.  For additional information, please review Wyoming Statutes 3-1-101 through 3-2-303.

COMMON TERMS 

1.  The “Petitioner” is the person who filed the Petition for Appointment of Guardian of a 

Minor (if you are filing the Petition to be appointed Guardian, then you are the 
Petitioner). 

2.  The “Respondent” or “Interested Party” is the person answering the Petition.  This may 
be a parent, or current guardian, or another person such as a relative or caregiver who 
does not want you to be the guardian.  

3.  “Guardian” means a person who has been appointed by the court to exercise the powers 
granted by the court. The term includes a plenary (full), limited, emergency and standby 
guardian, but does not include a Guardian ad Litem. 

4.  “Ward” means an individual for whom a guardian or conservator has been appointed by 

the court. In this case, it will be the minor child or children. 

5.  “Minor” means a child under the age of 18 that has not been emancipated.   
6.  A “Legal Parent” is a person who has established a parent-child relationship with the 

child.  A legal parent-child relationship can be established through biological relationship 
or through an adoption or paternity order issued by a court.  A woman who gives birth to 
a child is the child’s legal mother, unless her parental rights have been terminated by 
court order, such as through an order of termination or adoption by another person.  A 
man who is married to a woman at the time of the child’s birth will usually be presumed 
to be the legal father of a child and will be included on the birth certificate.  A man who 
is the biological father of a child, but who is not married to the mother of the child at the 
time of birth, can sign an acknowledgement of paternity to establish a legal parent-child 
relationship or there may be a paternity order from a court establishing the parent-child 
relationship.  Any legal parents for the child must be served with the Petition for 
Appointment of Guardian of a Minor.  

7.  “Order” means the official decree signed by the judge.  If you are granted Guardianship 

of a minor child, you will want to keep this document handy at all times to prove that you 
are the legal guardian.     

8.  “Letters” means formal notice identifying your authority as Guardian. You will need this 
proof to enroll the child in school, apply for public benefits, add him or her to your 
insurance, get medical care, and other legal situations. 

A filing fee of $70.00-$100.00 is required. Call the local District Court Clerk in your county for 
the exact amount.  If you feel you are unable to pay, you must complete the Affidavit of 
Indigency and Request for Waiver of Filing Fees and all Fees Associated Therewith.  You can 
get a copy of this form and the Order from the District Court Clerk’s office.  This form can also 
be found on the Supreme Court’s website, https://www.courts.state.wy.us/legal-assistances-and-
forms/court-self-help-forms/, Family Law Forms, Packet 18 (Miscellaneous Forms for 
Guardianship Actions).

FORMS 

Read these instructions carefully to determine what forms you may need. You may not need all 
of the listed forms. Check with the District Court where you plan to file your case to determine 
if they have any special requirements. You can find a directory of the District Courts here: 
https://www.courts.state.wy.us/district-courts/district-court-locations/ . 

STEPS TO FILING YOUR CASE 

Step 1: Complete the Forms. 

Before you file, make sure that you make copies of all the forms listed. NOTE: You can only use 
the forms for more than one child if the children have the SAME legal parents. If they have 
different parents, you MUST file separate forms. 

•  Civil Cover Sheet 

  For part I, fill in the Petitioner’s name address and names of minor children just 
like the caption on the other forms.  You will receive the docket number when 
you file.   

  For part II, you should check the box for “Guardianship” listed under “Probate.”  

  For part III, list any related cases.   

  For part IV, you may leave the “Amount in Controversy” blank. 

•  Petition for Appointment of Guardian of a Minor 

  The Petitioner must complete all applicable sections on the form.   

  If the child’s father is not known (no name appears on the birth certificate), then a 
copy of the birth certificate of the child should be attached to the Petition.  If the 
parental rights have been terminated or the parents are deceased, copies of the 
termination papers or the death certificates should be attached to the Petition. 

•  Summons and Return 

  This completed form will need to be served upon any parent of the minor child 
who is living and whose rights have not been terminated. If the child or children 
are not residing with a parent, then you must also serve any current guardian or 
custodian of the child.  

  
 

 

 

  Some courts may require you to also serve the child with the guardianship 

documents.  You may ask the local District Court Clerk in your county if you 
need to serve the child. 

  You must provide a file-stamped copy of the Petition to each person served. See 
below in the Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on 
“service.” 

•  Parental Consent to Appointment of a Guardian 

  The Minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian can consent (agree) to the appointment by 

completing this form. 

  If the parent or legal guardian signs this form, it must be signed in the presence 

of a Court Clerk or Notarial Officer (Notary Public). 

•  Consent to Guardianship or Nomination of a Guardian by a Minor 

  A Minor over the age of 14 can consent to the appointment or nominate a 
guardian by using this form. The Minor’s wishes may be considered in the 
appointment of a guardian. 

  If the Minor signs this form, it must be signed in the presence of a Court Clerk 

or Notarial Officer (Notary Public). 

Step 2: You are Ready to File your Papers with the Court. 

Provide the Court with the documents completed as described in Step 1 above and pay the filing 
fee.  You will need to make copies of the documents for each of the following persons 
(Interested Persons) and give them notice of the filing (see below for how to serve): 

a.  Any person who has the primary care and custody of the Minor. 

b.  Each living parent of the Minor or, if there is none, the adult nearest in kinship 

that can be found. 

c.  Any appointee of a parent whose appointment has not been terminated. 

d.  Any Guardian or Conservator currently acting for the Minor in this state or 

elsewhere. 

Step 3:  Notice to Parents and Other Interested Persons, if any. 

If  you  know  where  the  parents  or  other  interested  persons  (above)  are  located,  you  will 
need to have them served.  Service is required for the Petition for Appointment of Guardian

of a Minor and Summons so the Court has proof that the other party received the papers.  
Personal service of the Petition for Appointment of Guardian of a Minor and the Summons are 
required  to  be  made  on  the  Respondent  by  a  Sheriff,  unless  the  Respondent  completes  an 
Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form.  Other forms of service exist, but these are the 
two easiest methods that meet the formal service requirement for a Guardianship.  If you cannot 
serve the Respondent by either of these methods, you may request alternative methods of service, 
such as service by publication, in limited circumstances. 

You MUST give the Respondent official notice that you have filed the Petition for Appointment 
of Guardian of a Minor  within  90 days from  the  date  you filed the  Petition.  This is done by 
serving  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons  and  Petition  for  Appointment  of  Guardian  of  a 
Minor upon the opposing parties or by having them sign an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of 
Service  form  stating  that  copies  of  those  documents  were  received.    If  you  do  not  serve  the 
Respondents within 90 days, your case can be dismissed by the Court. 

See below in the Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on service. In 
addition to copies of the above forms, you will also need to prepare this form: 

•  Return (second page of the Summons) 

  This document must be filled out by the sheriff or process server that serves the 
Petition upon the parents and/or other interested persons. It must be notarized or 
signed by the District Court Clerk and filed with the District Court Clerk after 
service is completed. 

OR  

You can avoid paying for personal service if the parent(s) and/or other interested persons agree 
to the service. Each person who agrees must complete the following form:  

•  Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service 

  This form may be signed by the minor child’s parent or other interested person 
who is required to receive notice of the filing of the Petition.  If the respondent 
parent or other person agrees, you will not need to have the Summons and 
Petition formally served on him or her. See the Frequently Asked Questions 
section below for more information on “service.” 

  You must still provide file-stamped copies of the Summons and Petition to the 

parent or other person even if they accept service with this form. 

  If the parent or other interested person signs this form, it must be signed in the 

presence of a Court Clerk or Notarial Officer (Notary Public).

OR 

If you do not have a current address for the parents or other interested persons, or if their 
identity is not known and cannot be found with reasonable efforts (diligence), you must publish 
the notice of the Petition in the newspaper.  You will have to prove to the court that you tried to 
locate the person. You should look in the phone book, search the internet and Facebook, contact 
prior employers, family, friends, etc. to locate a current address.  You will need these forms:  

•  Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  If you do not know how to locate the parents or other interested person, you will 
need to complete this form and the next two forms.  You will need to fully 
complete these forms, except for the Clerk’s signature. 

  You must detail the efforts you made to obtain an address. 

•  Order for Service by Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  Fill out the top part of this form. The Judge will sign and date the order. 

•  Notice of Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  Complete this form and have it published for four (4) consecutive weeks in a 

newspaper of general circulation in the county where the hearing is to be held. 

  Do not sign where the Clerk needs to sign.  The Clerk must sign the Notice of 

Publication BEFORE you take it to the newspaper.  

•  Affidavit Following Service by Publication (Form available in Packet 18) 

  You will complete this form after you have published the notice in the newspaper 
for four (4) consecutive weeks, and obtained the Affidavit of Publisher from the 
newspaper.  

Step 4: Wait for the Answer Period to Expire. 

Once the parent(s) and/or other interested persons have been properly served, you must wait for 
the answer period to expire.  If the other party was personally served or acknowledged service, 
he or she has 20 days to respond, or 30 days if served out of state.  If the other party was 
served by publication, he or she has 30 days after the last day of publication to respond.  Once 
the time to file an Answer has expired, you can move forward with your case.

Step 5: Default.  

If the parent(s) or other interested persons were served, but did not sign a notarized consent or 
did not respond to the Petition, then you will want to have the Clerk enter a default into the case 
record before the hearing.  An entry of default does not guarantee that the court will approve the 
guardianship.  You are not required to enter a default if the Respondent doesn’t file an answer 
and you may skip this step and request a hearing.  If you want to have a default entered against 
the Respondent, you should prepare and file these forms with the District Court Clerk: 

•  Affidavit in Support of Default 

  This form must be signed by the Petitioner in the presence of a Court Clerk or 

Notarial Officer (Notary Public). 

•  Motion for Entry of Default 

  Make sure you give the correct date when the person was served or signed the 

affidavit acknowledging service. 

•  Entry of Default 

Step 6: Ask for a Hearing Date 

  If you know the Respondent’s address, you must give it to the Clerk, along with a 

pre-addressed, stamped envelope. 

Most guardianship cases will require a hearing, even if both parents or other interested persons 
agree (consent) and no one files an answer or objection. File a Request to Set Hearing.  The 
Judge’s office will tell you if a hearing is required.  DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE HEARING 
WILL BE SCHEDULED AUTOMATICALLY.  Once the answer period has expired (see 
above), you will have to formally request a hearing date from the Court.  

Your court may have forms to request a hearing date, or you can fill out these forms to request a 
hearing date: 

•  Request for Setting 

•  Order Setting Hearing 

  The District Court Clerk or Judicial Assistant will fill in the date, time and 

courtroom/Judge for the hearing. 

  You must send a copy of the Order Setting Hearing to all interested parties who 
consent or respond, Guardian ad Litem, or anyone else required by the Judge.

  I

  You will probably need to send the Order Setting Hearing to:  

  Any parents or legal guardians who consented to the Petition (although 

they do not need to attend the hearing); 

  Any other interested persons who responded to the Petition and do not 

have an entry of default against them (See above);  

  Any Guardian ad Litem assigned to the case; and  

  Any other person required by the Judge or Court. 

NOTE: Individual courts have different policies on scheduling, so it is important to contact the 
court where your case is filed to determine when and how to schedule your appearance in front 
of the Judge. 

Step 7: Before the Hearing. 

Pretrial Disclosures. If someone responded to the Petition and is objecting to the guardianship, 
you will need to prepare your evidence in advance.  See below for more information about the 
evidence you should present at the hearing.  Prior to the hearing, the Judge may order that you 
send a list of your witnesses and other evidence to the Court and other parties to the case a 
certain number of days before the hearing or by a specific date.  If you do not follow these 
instructions, the judge may not allow you to use your witnesses or other evidence. You can use 
this form to prepare your evidence lists for the other parties: 

•  Pretrial Disclosures form 

  Fill in the information at the top of the first page. The names, case number and court 

information should match the information on the Petition for Appointment of 
Guardian of a Minor.  

  Enter the names and contact information for any witnesses in the first table on page 4. 

  For each witness, check whether you expect to use them or if you will only use them 

if necessary. 

  In the second table, enter a name for each piece of evidence (“Document or Exhibit”) 
you might want to show the court. Example: “Exhibit A: Ward’s Medical Records.” 

  Enter a short description (“Summary of Evidence”) for each piece of evidence. 
Example: “These medical records describe the child’s special care needs.” 

  
 

 

 

  For each piece of evidence, check whether you expect to use it or if you will only use 

it if necessary. 

  Sign the Pretrial Disclosures form. 

  Complete the Certificate of Service section on the same day you file the document. 

1.  Make at least two copies of the completed form (one for yourself and one for the 

Respondent).  Hand deliver, fax, or use first class mail to send a copy of the Pretrial 
Disclosures form to the Respondent.  If the Respondent has a lawyer, you would send the 
form to his or her lawyer instead. 

Step 8: Prepare for the Hearing. 

Regardless of whether anyone objects or not, you will need to complete these forms to bring to 
the hearing: 

•  Order Appointing Guardian for Minor(s) and Visitation Order 

  The Judge will fill out and sign these forms, or you may be asked to fill out the 

Orders after the hearing.  Complete only the top portion (case name and number) 
of these forms before the hearing.  

  Bring them to the court hearing and present them to the Judge or Clerk when he or 

she requests it.  

•  Oath of Guardian 

  Do not sign the Oath of Guardian until the day of the hearing.  Fill out the top 
portion only.  After the hearing, you will take it over to the District Court Clerk, 
and sign it in her/his presence.   

•  Letters of Guardianship 

  Fill out the top portion.  This form will be signed by the District Court Clerk, and 

indicates when the guardianship expires, and is proof that you are the legal 
guardian of the minor child. 

  If you are filing for more than one child, prepare one for each child. 

You will also want to prepare your evidence.  See below for information about the evidence you 
should bring to your hearing.

Step 9: The Hearing 

The Petitioner must appear at the hearing and should be prepared to present evidence as to why 
the Guardianship is in the child’s best interest, even if no one has objected to the guardianship. 

a.  Be prepared to take notes. 

b.  Be prepared to present evidence showing that the parents are aware of the proceedings 

and that they agree to the Guardianship.   

c.  If the Petitioner cannot prove that the parents agree to the Guardianship, then he/she must 
be prepared to present evidence showing that the parents are either unwilling or unable to 
take care of the child or that their parental rights have been terminated. 

d.  You must prove to the court that the parents are unfit. You cannot merely demonstrate 

that you are the better person to care for the child.   Be prepared to offer exhibits such as 
medical records, social services records, and testimony of witnesses such as friends, 
family, or medical professionals, educators and babysitters. 

e.  If the Court appoints a Guardian, the Court will issue Letters of Guardianship as a formal 
notice of the appointment and will provide you with a copy of the Order Appointing 
Guardian for Minor(s). The Judge may ask you to complete the Letters and Order forms 
and other documents.  Make sure that you listen carefully and write down exactly what 
the Judge says when the Judge makes his or her decision. 

Step 10: After the Hearing 

1.  The District Court Clerk is required to send a copy of the Order to all parties and interested 

persons in the case. This includes: 

a.  Any parents or guardians who consented to the Petition (even if they did not attend 

the hearing); 

b.  Any parents, guardians or other interested persons who received notice of the Petition 

and do not have an Entry of Default against them (See above);  

c.  Any Guardian ad Litem assigned to the case; and  

d.  Any other person required by the Judge or Court. 

You may have to provide or pay for copies of the final Order sent to these additional parties.  

  
 

 

 

2.  You may need certified copies of the Letters and Order.  The number needed will vary, 

depending on your circumstances.  The District Court Clerk can make certified copies for 
you as needed (there will be a fee for extra certified copies).    

Step 11: Reporting Requirements after the Court Appoints a Guardian. 

Forms: 

•  Guardian’s Report  

  You will be required to file the reports: 

•  Within six months of your appointment as guardian; 

•  Every six months following the initial report; 

•  Within thirty days of your removal or resignation from, or the termination 

of, the guardianship; and/or 

•  At other times as the court may order.  

  The Guardian’s Report must be provided to the persons listed in the Order of 
Appointment within ten (10) days of filing the Report with the Court.  

If the Court or Judge has a form they want you to use, then you should use that one.  

The purpose of the six-month report is to inform the Court and other interested persons such as 
the parents about the well-being of the Minor.  The Guardian’s Report must describe the physical 
condition, including level of disability or functional incapacity, principal residence, treatment, 
care and activities of the Minor, as well as providing a description of those actions the Guardian 
has taken on behalf of the Minor.  

If you do not file a report, the Judge will enter an order for you to show cause why you, the 
Guardian, should not be held in contempt.  The Judge could also terminate (cancel) your 
guardianship of the child/children. 

When you are involved in a court case, you are responsible for delivery (service) of copies of 
important papers you file with the court to other people involved in the case (like the Minor’s 
parents or current legal guardian, for example).  Depending on the circumstances, the papers 
must be served by personal delivery (called personal service), or if the person agrees, they 
can waive personal delivery with a notarized statement.  In limited circumstances, you may

be allowed to serve by publishing a notice in a newspaper or by registered mail.  Service lets 
these persons know that you are asking the court to appoint a guardian for the child named in 
the Petition, the person you want the court to appoint as guardian, and the date and time 
when they must respond to your request.  

2.  How to Serve the Respondent.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to serve each 

Respondent: 

Option 1 – Service by Sheriff  

Summons.  It is recommended to have a Sheriff in the county where the Respondent can be 
found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 
($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).  You can contact the Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the  Respondent  lives  to  determine  the  fee  charged  by  the  Sheriff.    This  is  also  true  if  the 
Respondent is going to  be served in a different state.  You will need to provide the Sheriff 
with a file-stamped copy of the Summons and Petition to be served on the Respondent. 

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called the 
“Return” (or they may have their own form - an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the original with the District Court Clerk’s office and send you a copy.  If you receive what 
looks  like  the  original  “Return”  or  “Affidavit  of  Service”  from  the  Sheriff,  call  the  Clerk’s 
office to make sure the  original has been filed.   If it has not, then file the original with the 
Clerk’s office and keep a copy for yourself.  This is the proof that the Respondent was given 
proper notice. 

Note:  Once the Respondent has been served, you MUST file the original Summons and the 
original  Return  (or  Affidavit  of  Service)  with  the  District  Court  Clerk’s  office  so  that  the 
Judge knows that proper service was made. 

Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.   

If the Respondent agrees, he or she may sign a form stating that a copy of the Summons and 
Petition  were  received.  If  the  Respondent  agrees,  you  will  need  to  fill  out  an 
Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form.    The  Respondent  must  sign  this 
document in front of a Court Clerk or Notarial Officer (Notary Public).  

Proof  of  Service.    Once  the  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  is  signed, 
take the original and two (2) copies of the signed form to the District Court Clerk’s office for 
filing.    You  should  keep  one  copy  for  your  records  and  provide  the  other  copy  to  the 
Respondent. 

  
 

 

 

Note:    You  must  file  the  signed  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  and  the 
original Summons with the District Court Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper 
service was made on the Respondent.   

Option 3 – Service by publication if you cannot find a Respondent.   

If  you  were  unable  to  serve  the  Respondent  either  by  the  Sheriff  or  by  obtaining  an 
Acknowledgement  or  Acceptance  of  Service,  then  you  may  make  a  request  to  serve  the 
Respondent by publication.  (Forms available in Packet 18) 

There  are  additional  fees  for  service  by  publication  and  it  will  take  more  time.    If  you  are 
unsure whether or not you are allowed to serve the Respondent by publication, you need to 
consult with a lawyer.  However, if you can demonstrate that you have made every effort to 
find the respondent’s address, completely fill out a Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by 
Publication and Notice of Publication.   

After  the  District  Court  Clerk  signs  and  files  the  Notice  of  Publication,  it  is  your 
responsibility to contact the appropriate newspaper and to arrange for the publication and pay 
the appropriate fees.  An appropriate newspaper is one that has been regularly issued at least 
once each week for a period of fifty-two (52) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the first 
publication  of  notice  or  advertisements.    It  must  have  a  paid  circulation  of  at  least  five 
hundred (500) and  each  page must not be  less  than  ten  (10) inches by twelve  and one-half 
inches in size.  The newspaper must publish the notice once a week for four (4) consecutive 
weeks. 

Proof of Service.  The other party will have thirty (30) days after the last date of publication 
to  file  a  written  answer  to  your  Petition.    After  the  thirty  (30)-day  waiting  period,  fill  out, 
sign and notarize the Affidavit Following Service by Publication.  You must also attach the 
Affidavit of Publisher, which is a form the  newspaper  will  prepare  and  send  to  you  after it 
completes the publishing.   

Note:  You  must  file  the  Affidavit  Following  Service  by  Publication  and  the  Affidavit  of 
Publisher  with  the  Court  so  that  the  Judge  knows  that  proper  service  was  made  on  the 
Respondent.   

3.  Who can serve? 

If you are a party in the case, you cannot personally serve the Petition.  Any person over the 
age of 18 who is NOT a party to the case may personally serve documents, but it is usually 
easiest to ask a private process server, or a representative of the county sheriff’s civil 
division, to personally serve copies of the forms to the persons named above.  The forms 
cannot be sent by mail.  You will have to pay this person for his or her services. The District

Court Clerk in the county where you need to make service may have a list of local process 
servers.  

4.  What if I cannot locate one or both of the minor child’s parents or he or she is avoiding 

service of process? 

You will have to publish notice of the hearing in the newspaper in the county where you have 
filed the Petition.  See information above for forms and instructions on service by 
publication.   

5.  What if one or both of the minor child’s parents do not agree with me being the 

guardian? 

If the parents do not agree, then the court will most likely schedule a court hearing, where 
you will present your evidence as to why you should be appointed the guardian of the minor 
child.  The person asking for the guardianship, the Petitioner, has the burden of proof and 
must prove that the parents are unfit and that the guardianship is in the child’s best interest.  
At the hearing, the child’s parent(s) will be given a chance to show the judge why a 
guardianship is not necessary.  If a hearing is scheduled, you should consult with an attorney.  

6.  What if both of the child’s parents give their consent to me to be the guardian? 

If the parents give consent, and they sign the Parental Consent in front of a Court Clerk or 
Notarial Officer (Notary Public), then you may not need a hearing.  However, some Judges 
may still require a hearing.    

7.  What if I am granted guardianship (temporary or permanent), and then the child’s 

parent or parents change their mind and want the child back? 

The parent or parents usually have the right to ask for the child back at any time, unless their 
parental rights have been terminated.  However, you have legal custody of the child until the 
guardianship end date (usually when the child turns 18 for a permanent guardianship) or until 
the Court says otherwise.  If the term for the guardianship has not ended, the parents will 
have to file paperwork to ask the court to set aside the guardianship.  When that happens, you 
will need to file an answer and the court will set a hearing on the matter.  Be sure that the 
court always has your current address and phone numbers at all times, and read all mail you 
may get from the court, and follow any instructions carefully and on time.
