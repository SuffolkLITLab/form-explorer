A NOTE ABOUT MARITAL vs. NON-MARITAL ASSETS AND DEBTS 
 

In the following tables you will be asked to distinguish marital property/debt from non-marital 
(separate) property/debt.  Marital property/debt will be divided between you and your spouse as 
part of the divorce; non-marital property/debt usually will not be divided (depending on the 
situation). 

he general rule is that marital property and debt is any property or debt acquired during the 
marriage for the benefit of the marriage, regardless of who paid for it or whose name is on it. 
However, just because a party acquired property before marriage does not necessarily mean that 
it won’t be considered marital property. A spouse's premarital separate property can become 
marital when a married couple demonstrates an intent, through their words or actions during 
marriage, to treat one spouse's separate property as marital property. Gifts and inheritances are 
generally separate property, although gifts for the benefit of the marriage, such as a dishwasher, 
may be considered marital property. 

During the marriage" generally means from the time of marriage until the time of separation. 

eople often dispute what property/debt is marital or how long the marriage lasted. When this 
happens, you are urged to consult with an attorney to learn about the various legal arguments that 
may be available to you.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
