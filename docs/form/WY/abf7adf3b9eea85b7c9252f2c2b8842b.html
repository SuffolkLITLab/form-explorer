forms supplement the packet(s) you have already purchased or downloaded from the Court. Most 
likely you will only need to use these additional forms for one of the following areas:  
 

1.  Additional ways to serve a Defendant/Respondent – use if you are unable to serve 
the Defendant/Respondent by the Sheriff or if the Defendant/Respondent will not sign 
an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service; 

2.  Waiver  of  Fees  –  use  if  you  are  unable  to  pay  the  Court’s  filing  fees  and/or  the 

Sheriff’s service fees;  

3.  Motion  Forms  –  use  if  you  need  to  make  a  request  of  the  Court  (or  respond  to  a 

request) before the final order is entered;  

4.  Dismissal Forms – use if you would like to dismiss the action before a final order is 

entered.

Service by publication requires the following forms:

To use service by publication, you must show that you have made every effort to find the 
Defendant/Respondent’s address. Completely fill out a Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by 
Publication and a Notice of Publication. (DO NOT sign where the Clerk needs to sign.)   

The Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication says that service of Summons

their address, check the first box and enter the address. 

If you do not know the Defendant/Respondent’s address, check the second box. Also, be 
sure to check off each method you used to try to find the Defendant/Respondent’s address. Note 
that you will need to attach any returned letters you wrote to the Defendant/Respondent.

the Defendant/Respondent by publication, you need to talk to a lawyer.   

If  you  DO  NOT  KNOW  the  Defendant/Respondent’s  address  and  cannot  find  it  after  making  every 
effort, the affidavit must detail the efforts you made to obtain an address.

Publisher. The newspaper will send you the Affidavit of Publisher after it completes publishing 
the Notice. File the Affidavit Following Service by Publication with the Court. If the other party 
fails to respond by that time limit, you may follow the procedures for default as discussed in your

The following form is needed for service by registered or certified mail:  

•  Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail 

 

If the Defendant/Respondent lives outside of Wyoming and you know their address, you 
may  serve  the  Defendant/Respondent  by  registered  or  certified  mail.  To  serve  a  person  by 
registered  or  certified  mail,  you  need  to  pay  a  fee  and  ask  the  Clerk  to  mail  the  Notice  to  the 
Defendant/Respondent. You need to have everything ready before going to the Clerk.  

  First, complete the Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail and make 

two copies.   

•  Second, fill out the Summons. The address in the Summons must match the address in 
the Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail. Remember that  you do not sign 
the Summons, the Clerk does.

sure  you  have  the  correct  addresses  and  proper  postage  on  the  envelope.  Then  complete  the 
registered  or  certified  mail  forms  and  mark  them  as  “Restricted  Delivery”  with  return  receipt 
requested. 

•  Fourth, gather the document that you want to serve and make two copies. This should 

be the Petition or Motion, depending on what you are trying to do. 

•  Fifth, make sure you have an extra copy of everything for your records. 

ring all of the above materials to the Clerk, including Summons and the Petition/Motion.

gets the signed mail receipt from the Defendant/Respondent, the Clerk will file the receipt and 
record that service is complete. See Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 4(l) and 4(r).

Recap for Serving by Registered or Certified Mail: 

1.  Fill out an Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail and file an original 

and two copies with the Clerk. 

2.  Take an envelope with proper postage, and the registered or certified mail postal forms 
marked  “restricted delivery,”  to the  Clerk  so that the  Clerk can  mail  the documents  to 
the Defendant/Respondent.

packet.

.  Waiver of Fees.  If you are unable to pay the fees, you may ask the Judge to waive the 
costs  of  the  filing  and  service  fees  with  an  Affidavit  of  Indigency  and  Request  for  Waiver  of 
Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith, together with the Order on Request for Waiver of 
Filing  Fees  and  All  Fees  Associated  Therewith.  (You  cannot  waive  the  cost  of  the  newspaper 
publication  fee.)    The  Judge  will  then  decide  whether  or  not  to  grant  your  request.  Procedures 
and policies vary from court to court so there is no guarantee that you will not have to pay fees. 

Recap for Requesting a Waiver of Fees: 

1.  Fill  out  an  Affidavit  of  Indigency  and  Request  for  Waiver  of  Filing  Fees and  All  Fees Associated 

Therewith; 

2.  Fill out an Order on Request for Waiver of Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith; 
3.  File both the Affidavit and the Order with the Court; 
4.  The Judge will determine whether or not you will need to pay the filing fees and service fees in your 

action and will mail a copy of the Order to you. 

3.  Motion Forms. 
It is recommended that you ask an attorney for help.  However, if 
you need to make a request of the Court (or respond to a request) before the Court enters its final 
order, this packet contains the following forms to help you:

Motion 
Response to Motion 
Order on Motion

Request for Setting and Order Setting Hearing forms that are in your original packet. You must 
file all three (3) forms with the Clerk’s office. The Request for Setting allows the court to hear 
about  your motion  and to  decide whether to  grant  your request.  It  also  tells  the court what  the 
hearing is for and the amount of time needed. The Judge will fill in the hearing date and time and 
return  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  to  you.  For  each  form  you  file,  you  must  give  the  Clerk  an

be given what they asked for in the motion. Generally, you must file your Response and deliver it 
to  the  other  party  by  the  earlier  of  two  dates:  1)  within  twenty  (20)  days  from  the  date  it  was 
mailed to you; or 2) if there is a hearing, at least three (3) days before the hearing date. If there

ORDER FOR SERVICE BY PUBLICATION 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  court  has  reviewed  the  Petitioner’s/Movant’s  Motion  and  Affidavit  for  Service  by 
Publication, and verified [  ] Petition for Appointment of Guardian or [  ] Motion to Terminate 
Guardianship.  It appears that: 

1. 

 The Respondent’s address is known but service to Respondent cannot be made within 

the state because Respondent is a nonresident; 

OR 

ascertained; and 

  The  Respondent’s  address  is  unknown  and  cannot  with  reasonable  diligence  be 

2.  Service  of  process  by  publication  is  proper  pursuant  to  Wyoming  Statutes  §3-2-102(d), 

and Rule 4(k) of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure. 

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  

1. 

2. 

  The  Petitioner/Movant  will  serve  process  on  the  Respondent  by  publishing  the 
Summons  in  this  case  in  a  newspaper  of  general  circulation,  in  the  County  of 
____________________ (county where Petition/Motion filed), State of Wyoming, at least once 
per week for four (4) consecutive weeks. The Summons to be published must contain a 
statement of the Petitioner’s/Movant’s claim against the Respondent and the consequence 
of default if the Respondent fails to appear. 

  Because  the  Respondent’s  address  is  known  but  Respondent  is  a  nonresident,  the 
Petitioner/Movant  will  immediately,  after  the  first  publication,  deliver  to  the  Clerk  of 
District  Court  a  copy  of  the  publication  notice  and  an  envelope  to  be  sent  by  certified 
mail/restricted  delivery  addressed  to  Respondent  with  proper  postage.    The  Clerk  shall

then  mail  the  notice  and  make  an  entry  on  the  appearance  docket.    (Rule  4(l)(2)(B), 
Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure) 

3.  When  publication  is  completed,  the  Petitioner/Movant  will  file  with  the  court  an 
Affidavit  of  Publication,  verifying  publication  of  the  Summons  in  accordance  with  this 
order.

shall make a request to the appropriate official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later 

than three (3) working days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the 

court reporter by phone or by submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice 

through the mail, the request must be received by the court reporter no later than three working 

days prior to the hearing.  The Clerk of District Court will be able to inform you which court 

reporter to contact.  The three-day notice requirement will not be waived by the Court.  The 

notice is required for all civil matters including jury trials. If a hearing is not recorded by an 

official court reporter, a transcript of the hearing will not be available.   It is very difficult to 

appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not have a transcript of everything that is said at the trial.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
