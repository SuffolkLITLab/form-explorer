WRIT OF CONTINUING GARNISHMENT

, EMPLOYER, 

READ THIS WRIT CAREFULLY. IF YOU FAIL TO DO WHAT IT REQUIRES, YOU MAY BE 
ORDERED TO APPEAR IN COURT TO SHOW CAUSE WHY YOU ARE NOT IN CONTEMPT 
OF COURT FOR FAILURE TO ANSWER THIS WRIT. 

ame of Employee:  __________________________________________________________________ 

1.  This WRIT OF CONTINUING  GARNISHMENT (hereinafter “Writ”) is issued in the name of the 
State of Wyoming and accordingly, YOU ARE ATTACHED AS GARNISHEE pursuant to Wyoming 
Statutes §1-15-501 through §1-15-511, until such time as the employment relationship is terminated, 
the underlying judgment is vacated, modified or satisfied in full, the writ is dismissed, or ninety (90) 
days have expired since the Writ became effective, whichever is sooner. This Writ is a continuing levy 
upon any earnings owed by you, the Garnishee, to the above-named Judgment Debtor, at the time of 
service of this Writ and all earnings accruing from the effective date of service up to and including the 
ninetieth  day  thereafter.  “Earnings”  means  compensation  paid  or  payable  for  personal  services, 
including, but not limited to wages, salary, commission, bonus, proceeds of any pension or retirement 
benefits or deferred compensation plan. “Earnings” does not include compensation paid as per diem.  
2.  You MUST file with the court a verified answer (see attached “Answer to Writ of Continuing 
Garnishment”)  no  later  than  ten  (10)  days  following  the  date  the  Judgment  Debtor  receives 
earnings for the first pay period affected by the Writ, or forty (40) days following the date the 
Writ was served on you, whichever is earlier. For each pay period affected by the Writ, you must pay 
any nonexempt earnings and deliver a calculation of the exempt earnings to the clerk of court no more 
than ten (10) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, following the day the Judgment 
Debtor receives earnings affected by the Writ. 

3.  You are required by law to give a copy of this Writ, together with the calculation of exempt earnings, 
to the Judgment Debtor, identified above, at the time the Judgment Debtor receives earnings for the first 
pay period affected by this Writ. For all subsequent pay periods affected by this Writ, you shall deliver 
a copy of the calculation of the amount of exempt earnings to the Judgment Debtor at the time he/she

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE 
____________ JUDICIAL DISTRICT 

receives earnings for that pay period. To calculate the amount of exempt earnings owed to the Judgment 
Debtor for a single pay period, and the amount of nonexempt earnings payable to the Judgment Creditor 
for  a  single  pay  period,  you  must  first  calculate  “net  disposable  earnings”  by  deducting  all  amounts 
required to be withheld from the “gross wages earned per pay period.” Then, use the following chart to determine 
the amounts to be paid to the Judgment Debtor and Judgment Creditor based on the Judgment Debtor’s “net 
disposable earnings”: 

WEEKLY 
a. $217.50 or less 

BIWEEKLY 
a. $435.00 or less 

SEMIMONTHLY 
a. $471.25 or less 

MONTHLY 
a. $942.50 or less 

NO Garnishment 

NO Garnishment 

NO Garnishment 

NO Garnishment 

b. More than $217.50 

b. More than $435.00 

b. More than $471.25 

but less than $290.00: 
GARNISH ALL earnings 
above $217.50 

c. More than $290.00 
GARNISH 25% of the  
earnings  

but less than $580.00: 
GARNISH ALL earnings 
above $435.00 

c. More than $580.00 
GARNISH 25% of the  
earnings  

but less than $628.33: 
GARNISH ALL earnings 
above $471.25 

c. More than $628.33 
GARNISH 25% of the  
earnings  

b. More than $942.50 
but less than $1,256.67: 
GARNISH ALL earnings 
above $942.50 

c. More than $1,256.67 

GARNISH 25% of the  
earnings  

.  If the Judgment Debtor disagrees with the Garnishee’s calculation of the amount of exempt earnings, 
the  Judgment  Debtor  has  five  (5)  days,  excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays  and  legal  holidays,  from  the 
receipt  of  the  calculation  of  exempt  earnings  in  which  to  resolve  the  issue,  by  agreement,  with  the 
Garnishee, during which time the Garnishee shall not pay any money to the clerk of the court. If the 
objection  is  not  resolved  in  five  (5)  days,  excluding  Saturdays,  Sundays  and  legal  holidays,  the 
Garnishee shall pay the withheld income to the clerk of court and the judgment debtor may file a written 
objection with the clerk setting forth in reasonable detail the reason for the objection. The objection 
shall be filed with the clerk of court and a copy mailed to the Judgment Creditor or his/her attorney of 
record within five (5) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, from the date the withheld 
earnings are received by the clerk of court. 

5.  Pursuant to Wyoming Statute §1-15-504, only one (1) Writ shall be satisfied at one (1) time. When 
more than one (1) Writ has been issued against earnings due the same Judgment Debtor, they shall be 
satisfied in the order of service on the Garnishee. When a Writ is served upon a Garnishee during the 
effective period of a prior Writ, service of the subsequent Writ shall be deemed effective from the time 
the  liens  of  all  prior  Writs  have  terminated.  NOTE:  An  income  withholding  order  for  child  support 
obtained  pursuant  to  Wyoming  Statute  §20-6-201  through  §20-6-222  has  priority  over  any  other 
continuing garnishment. 

6.  Pursuant to Wyoming Statute §1-15-509, no employer shall discharge an employee for the reason that 
a creditor of the employee has subjected or attempted to subject unpaid earnings of the employee to any 
continuing garnishment directed to the employer for the purpose of paying any judgment.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
