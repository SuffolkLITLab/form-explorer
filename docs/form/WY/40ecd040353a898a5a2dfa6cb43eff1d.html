      <pre>CUSTODY AND CHILD SUPPORT MODIFICATION 
 INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ONFIDENTIALITY:  If you have concerns about confidential information, such as addresses 
and/or social security numbers, please consult an attorney and do not attempt to do this on your 
own.  You should also  know that Domestic Violence Protection Orders or Stalking Orders  are 
available  free  of  charge  at  the  circuit  court  clerks’  offices.    You  may  request  assistance  in 
obtaining Domestic Violence Protection or Stalking Orders from your local domestic violence or 
sexual  assault  program  or  you may call the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence  & 
Sexual  Assault  (844)  264-8080  (toll  free)  or  (307)  755-0992.    There  are  also  private  attorneys 
that are willing to assist clients in these matters.   If you have ever obtained a Protection Order 
against the other party, this  information  should be indicated in  the  Petition to  Modify Custody 
and Support or the Counterclaim.    

ead  through  the  following  information  and  instructions  before  completing  the  forms  to 
ensure that you qualify to file for a modification of custody and child support in Wyoming. 
You must fill out all forms as completely as possible.  If  your forms are not complete, the 
Judge may reject your packet.   

his packet is to modify custody and child support.  If you wish to modify child support only, 

a separate packet is available.

Qualifying  for  a  modification  of  custody:    In  order  to  modify/adjust  a  current 
custody  arrangement,  the  Petitioner  must  show  the  Court  that  there  has  been  a 
material change in circumstances. 
  

a.  Material change in circumstances: A court may modify an order concerning the care, 
custody and visitation of the children if there is a showing by either parent of a material 
change in circumstances since the entry of the order in question and that the modification 
would  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  children  pursuant  to  Wyoming  law.  (Wyo.  Stat. 
§20-2-201(a)).  A  condition  which  existed  when  the  custody  order  was  entered  is  not  a 
material change of circumstances.  

b.  Burden  of  proof:    It  is  up  to  the  person  trying  to  modify  or  change  the  custody 
arrangement  of  the  earlier  order/decree  to  establish  that  a  material  change  in 
circumstances has occurred, following the entry of the previous order.  

c.  Judges have broad decision-making authority: Custody, visitation, child support, and 
alimony are all committed to the sound discretion of the district court. The welfare and 
needs of the children are to be given paramount consideration. The determination of the 
best interests of the child is a question for the Judge. A Judge’s decision is very hard to 
overturn.

Modifying  child  support:    Often  when  a  person  seeks  to  modify  child  custody,  child 
support  will  also  be  affected.    If  that  is  the  situation  in  your  case,  this  packet  includes 
information to modify child support too. 

If a party wishes to modify the current custody and child support order and they believe a 
material change in circumstances exists, then that party will file a Petition to Modify Custody and 
Support  (“Petition”).    The  person  filing  the  Petition  is  the  “Petitioner”  regardless  of  whether 
he/she  was  the  Plaintiff  or  the  Defendant  when  the  child  support  order  was  first  entered.    The 
other party is referred to as the “Respondent.”   
 

Once  a  Petition has been filed, a copy must be  formally  given to  (a/k/a  served on) the 
Respondent, who is then expected to respond the Petition.   Personal service of the Petition and 
Summons on the Respondent by a Sheriff is required for the Petition UNLESS the Respondent 
completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form.  Formal service is required for 
the  Petition,  so  the  Court  has  proof  that  the  Respondent  actually  received  the  papers.    Other 
forms of service exist, but these are the easiest methods that meet the formal service requirement 
for a Petition.   

TEP 1.   Response or Response and Counterclaim.  Two options exist – 
you may either file a Response to the Petition or file a Response and Counterclaim.  Both options 
are explained below: 
 

PTION A.  Response  to  Petition.      If  you  have  been  served  or  have  signed  an 
Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form,  you  should  file  a  Response  to  Petition  to 
Modify  Custody  and  Support  with  the Clerk  of  District  Court  where  the  Petition  was  filed.   A 
Response  to  Petition  to  Modify  Custody  and  Support  is  a  written  document  explaining  to  the 
court  exactly  which  provisions  you  agree  with  and  which  provisions  you  deny.  If  you  fail  to 
answer,  a  default  judgment  may  be  entered  against  you  and  the  Petitioner  may  be  entitled  the 
relief he or she asked for in the Petition.  

ou must fill in the caption.  DO NOT forget to include the case number.  This is located 

  O

  Y

in the caption of the Summons and/or Petition. 
  
 

Admit  or  Deny.    To  respond  to  the  Petition,  you  should  go  through  each  and 
i. 
every paragraph of the Petition and either “admit” or “deny” each paragraph.  If you do 
not have sufficient information to either admit or deny a particular allegation, you must 
state that in  your Response to Petition to Modify Custody and Support.  If you disagree 
with something and  you fail to “deny” it in  your Response, the Judge can find that you 
admitted it. 
 
Time  limit  to  respond.    You  have  only  a  limited  amount  of  time  to  file  a 
ii. 
response to the  Petition.   Generally, if  you were served within the State of Wyoming, 

nstructions:

you will have 20 days to file the Response to Petition to Modify Custody and Support.  If 
you were served outside the State of Wyoming, you generally will have 30 days to file a 
response.  If you do not file a response by your deadline, then your spouse may obtain an 
Order Modifying Custody and Support giving him/her everything he/she requested in the 
Petition. 

iii. 
Computation of Time Limits.  In  computing most  time limits,  unless otherwise 
stated, the day the pleading is served shall not be included. The last day of the period so 
computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, when 
the  act  to  be  done  is  the  filing  of  a  paper,  a  day  on  which  weather  or  other  conditions 
have made the office of the clerk of the court inaccessible, in which event the period runs 
until  the  end  of  the  next  day  which  is  not  one  of  the  aforementioned  days.  When  the 
period  of  time  prescribed  or  allowed  is  less  than  11  days,  intermediate  Saturdays, 
Sundays,  and  legal  holidays  shall  be  excluded  in  the  computation.  A  "legal  holiday" 
includes any day officially recognized as a legal holiday in this state by designation of the 
legislature or appointment as a holiday by the governor.  

OTE:  If you have any question or concerns as to when the deadline to file a response is, 

you should consult an attorney. 
 

iv. 
REQUIRED  INFORMATION  FOR  CHILD(REN):  Certain  information  is 
required  to  be  given  under  oath  for  each  child,  unless  you  have  a  court  order  or  are 
operating  under  another  law  allowing  you  to  maintain  confidentiality  of  addresses  or 
other identifying information.  If the information is not provided, the court, upon motion 
of a party or its own motion, may stop the case from going forward until the information 
is provided. The information necessary is included in the Response and the Response and 
Counterclaim. 

. 
Certificate  of  Service:    Copies  of  all  documents  sent  to  or  filed  with  the  court 
must be sent to the Petitioner before the Judge will consider them.  This is certificate is 
included at the end of each document that requires it.   

i. 
Copies.  Make two (2) copies of the document.  The original will be filed by the 
Clerk of District Court, one copy is for the Petitioner and the other copy is for you (the 
Respondent).    You  will  need  to  repeat  this  step  for  all  documents  you  file  with  the 
Clerk’s office.

OPTION B.  Response and Counterclaim.  If you want the Judge to grant relief to you, 
you should file a Response and Counterclaim.  This document responds to the Petition and gives 
you an opportunity to tell the court what  you want to happen with the  case.  First,  you will go 
through each and every paragraph of the Petition and either “admit” or “deny” each paragraph.  
Second, the Counterclaim  portion of the document  asks  the Judge to  give  you what  you want.  
You must fill out all of the information in the document completely.

Follow  Step  1(ii)  through  Step  1(vi)  above.    You  will  also  need  to  obtain  a 
i.   
certified  copy  of  the  prior  custody  order  and  attach  it  to  your  Response  and 
Counterclaim.  Certified copies can be obtained from the Clerk of Court who entered the 
order.  You will need to pay a copying charge for any copies obtained. 

OTE:  If you have any question or concerns as to when the deadline to file the Response 

and Counterclaim is, you should consult an attorney. 
 

ii. 

Petitioner’s  Reply  to  Your  Counterclaim.    The  Petitioner  must  reply  to  the 
Counterclaim.  If you file a Counterclaim, the Petitioner will have 20 days to “reply” by filing a 
Reply to Counterclaim.  The Petitioner will either admit or deny the separate allegations in your 
Counterclaim.    If  the  Petitioner  fails  to  reply  to  the  Counterclaim,  you  may  be  entitled  to  file 
Default paperwork seeking the relief you request in your Counterclaim.  
  
STEP  2.        Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Respondent’s Response is required to 
be  served  on  the  Petitioner  (use  the  table  in  2.A.  below  to  determine  date).  The  information 
consists of a schedule of financial assets; schedule of non-financial assets; schedule of all debts 
owed  individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information; 
information  regarding  other  income  and  retirement  accounts;  and  a  summary  of  the  facts 
believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child custody is at issue.  
Both  parties  are  required  to  provide  this  information  in  order  to  fully  disclose  finances  of  the 
parties relating to the calculation of child support.   

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

A.  WHEN  TO  PROVIDE:    You  must  provide  your  Initial  Disclosures  to  the 
Petitioner  (or  his/her  attorney)  WITHIN  30  DAYS  AFTER  YOUR  RESPONSE  IS 
REQUIRED  TO  BE  SERVED  ON  THE  PETITIONER  (use  table  below).    Be  sure  to 
keep a copy of your Initial Disclosures form for your records.  Use the following to 
determine the date when you and the Petitioner are required to provide initial disclosures 
to one another.     
 

1.  Begin with the date you were served with the Petition: ___________________ 

      

2.  Next, determine when you are required to file your Response: 

a.  If  you  were  served  in  Wyoming,  add  20  days  to  the  date  in  #1:  

__________________________ 
OR 

b.  If  you  signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service,  add  20 

days to the date in #1:  ___________________________ 

c. 

OR 
If you were served out-of-state, add 30 days to the date in #1:

with  documentation  of  both  current  and  past  earnings.  Proper  documentation  of 
current earnings includes, but is not limited to pay stubs, employer statements, or 
receipts and  expenses if  self-employed. Documentation  of current  earnings shall 
be supplemented with copies of the most recent tax return to provide verification 
of  earnings  over  a  longer  period.  Include  copies  of  income  tax  returns  for  the 
previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to show how much you have 
made so far this year.  

•  The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit  may  be  filed  with  the  Clerk’s  office  at  the 

same time you file your Response or Response and Counterclaim.

.  Military Personnel: Military regulations specify that military duty will not be used 
as a basis for avoiding family support obligations, but setting the level of support is a 
civilian  matter.    It  is  most  common  to  set  the  support  obligation  based  on  basic 
military  pay.    You  can  go  to  www.dfas.mil  for  updates  on  military  pay  and  many 
other issues. If military pay and benefits are an issue in your child support case, you 
may  want  to  contact  an  attorney  for  assistance.    The  following  is  also  a  helpful 
website:

.  Overtime compensation: Overtime compensation is not counted in the “net income” 
unless  the  court,  after  considering  all  overtime  earnings  derived  in  the  preceding 
twenty-four (24) month period, determines the overtime earnings can  reasonably  be 
expected to continue on a consistent basis. 

.  Entry of income withholding order.  An income withholding order (IWO) enables 
an employer to take child support out of the pay of the parent obligated to pay.  The 
court always enters an IWO which takes effect immediately, unless the parties agree 
otherwise, or unless one (1) of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there 
is good cause not to require immediate income withholding. When the parties agree to 
an alternative arrangement, the arrangement must be in writing, signed by the parties 
and  reviewed  and  entered  in  the  record  by  the  court.  The  court  shall  include  in  the 
record 
including  a  statement  explaining  why 
implementation of immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests 
of  the  child  and,  in  cases  involving  modification  of  child  support,  proof  of  timely 
payments.

OPTION A.  If you and the Petitioner agree on all of the terms in the Order Modifying Custody 
and Support, sign the Order in front of a Notarial Officer.  Here is some important information 
about the Order: 
 

The  Order  will  need  to  be  filled  out  completely,  signed  by  you  and  the  Petitioner  and 
both of your signatures need to be notarized.  In addition to signing the Order, you should also 
initial each page of the Order to verify that each page contains the terms you agreed upon.

  An  income  withholding  order  which  did  not  become  effective  immediately  upon 
entry,  becomes  effective  upon  the  earliest  of  the  following:  (i) the  date  the  parent 
paying  requests  withholding  commence;  or  (ii) child  support  becomes  delinquent  in 
payment of an amount equal to one (1) month's support obligation under the support 
order. 

.  Limits  on  amounts  withheld:  The  total  amount  that  can  be  withheld  from  any 
employee's paycheck is limited by the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). The 
limits  provided  in  the  CCPA  are  fifty  percent  (50%)  of  disposable  earnings  if  the 
parent who pays child support has a second family and sixty percent (60%) if there is 
no second family. These limits are each increased by five percent (5%) if payments 
are  in  arrears  for  a  period  equal  to  twelve  (12)  weeks  or  more.    See  definition  of 
disposable income in paragraph 4 below. 

.  Social  security  or  veteran’s  benefits.    If  your  children  receive  part  of  a  parent’s 
social  security  or  veteran  benefits,  you  might  want  to  contact  an  attorney  or  legal 
services  program  for  assistance  with  child  support  calculation.  If  a  proportion  of  a 
support  obligor's  (person  who  is  supposed  to  pay  child  support)  social  security  or 
veteran's benefit is paid directly to the custodian (parent or guardian with custody of 
the children) of the obligor's children who are the subject of the child support order, 
the total amount of the social security or veteran's benefit, including the amounts paid 
to  the obligor and custodian under the child support order, will  be counted as gross 
income to the obligor (count the amount the children receive as income to the parent 
who has to pay support). You will need to calculate the child support due and subtract 
the  amount  of  the  social  security  or  veteran's  benefit  sent  directly  to  the  custodial 
parent from the noncustodial (obligor's) parent’s share of presumptive support.  If the 
subtraction  of  the  social  security  or  veteran's  benefit  sent  directly  to  the  custodian 
results in a negative dollar amount, the support amount shall be set at zero.  The child 
support  obligation  shall  be  offset  by  the  amount  of  the  social  security  or  veteran's 
benefit  sent  directly  to  the  custodian,  beginning  from  the  time  the  custodian  began 
receiving the social security or veteran's benefit.  Wyo. Stat. §20-2-304(e).     

.  Date new amount of child support begins.  An order for child support is not subject 
to  retroactive  modification  except:  (i)  Upon  agreement  of  the  parties;  or  (ii)  The 
order  may  be  modified  with  respect  to  any  period  during  which  a  petition  for 
modification is pending, but only from the date notice of that petition was served on 
the Respondent.   Wyo. Stat. §20-2-311(d). 

.  When  the  child  support  obligation  ends.      An  on-going  child  support  obligation 

terminates when the: 
(i)  Parents marry or remarry each other (After the remarriage of the parents to each 
other, the court may eliminate all child support arrearage existing between the parents 
except those assigned to the state of Wyoming); 
(ii)   Child dies;  
(iii)  Child is legally emancipated; or

c. 
"Arrearage"  means  past  due  child  support,  past  due  medical  support,  past  due 
spousal support, attorneys fees, guardian ad litem fees, costs, interest and penalties, but, 
does not include property settlements. 

“Income"  means  any  form  of  payment  or  return  in  money  or  in  kind  to  an 
d. 
individual, regardless of source.  Income includes, but  is not  limited to  wages, earnings, 
salary,  commission,  compensation  as  an  independent  contractor,  temporary  total 
disability, permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, worker's compensation 
payments,  unemployment  compensation,  disability,  annuity  and  retirement  benefits  and 
any other payments made by any payor. 

e. 
The  following  is  not  “income”:    Means  tested  sources  of  income  such  as  Pell 
Grants,  aid  under  the  Personal  Opportunities  With  Employment  Responsibilities 
(POWER)  Program,  food  stamps  and  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI)  shall  not  be 
considered as income.  

f.  “Net”  or  “Disposable”  income  is  the  gross  income  minus  total  mandatory 
deductions.  Mandatory deductions: federal income tax withheld, social security tax 
(FICA)  withheld,  state  income  tax  withheld,  and  other  deductions  required  by  law, 
such  as  required  disability  contributions  and/or  required  retirement  contributions.  
The cost of dependant health care coverage for dependent children may be deducted 
too. 

g.  “Imputed  income”  can  be  used  when  either  parent  is  voluntarily  unemployed  or 
underemployed.  In  such  case  the  child  support  shall  be  computed  based  upon  the 
potential  earning  capacity  (imputed  income)  of  the  unemployed  or  underemployed 
parent. In making that determination the court shall consider:  

  

1)  Prior employment experience and history;  
2)  Educational  level  and  whether  additional  education  would  make  the  parent 

more self-sufficient or significantly increase the parent's income;  

3)  The presence of children of the marriage in the parent's home and its impact 

on the earnings of that parent;  

   4)  Availability of employment for which the parent is qualified;  
   5)  Prevailing wage rates in the local area;  
   6)  Special skills or training; and

   7)  Whether the parent is realistically able to earn imputed income.  
 

h.  "Age of majority" means a person eighteen (18) years of age, except for purposes of 
child  support  obligations,  a  parent's  legal  obligation  for  the  support  of  his  or  her 
children,  whether  natural  or  adopted,  continues  past  the  age  of  majority  in  cases 
where  the  children  are:  (i) mentally  or  physically  disabled  and  thereby  incapable  of 
self support; or (ii) between the age of majority and twenty (20) years and attending 
high school or an equivalent program as full-time participants.  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR CALCULATING CHILD SUPPORT: 
 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Petitioner completed (or by the  Affidavit of Imputed Income if the Petitioner did 
not  complete  his/her  own  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit).    You  may  use  the 
Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to  help  you  calculate  the  support 
due.  Another option is to go online to: 

  You  CANNOT  agree  that  no  support  will  be  paid.    The  statutes  allow  for  a 
reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical custody and each parent 
keeps  the  child(ren)  overnight  for  more  than  twenty-five  percent  (25%)  of  the  year 
and both parents contribute substantially to the expenses of the children in addition to 
the payment of child support. 

 

 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-support 
reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from the tables in 20-2-304(a), 
the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial 
parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-support  reserve.   “Self-support  reserve”  means  the 
current poverty line for one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated 
periodically  in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-2-304(f) 

➢  There are NO DEVIATIONS from the presumed support allowed UNLESS the Court 
CHOOSES  to  deviate  from  the  set  amount  because  the  amount  was  unjust  or 
inappropriate in  the particular  case. The Court must  include the specific reasons  for 
deviation in the Order.  
 

➢  NO AGREEMENTS FOR LESS THAN THE PRESUMED SUPPORT CAN BE 
APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE  BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  TITLE 
19,  KID  CARE,  FOOD  STAMPS,  POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED 
ON BEHALF OF ANY CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of

child support calculated by using the net income of you and the Petitioner even if you 
and the Petitioner agree to a lower amount of support. 

  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support,  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to  pay for 
expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for 
which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Plaintiff  and  50%  to 
Defendant).

•  When will your custody and child support order be modified?  Your order modifying 
custody and child support will not be effective until the Judge signs the Order and it is 
filed  with  the  Clerk.    This  process  may  take  time  if  the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the 
proposed  Order.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk  that  the  Order  has  been  file-stamped 
before you can be sure your child support order has been modified. 

PTION B.  If  you  and  the  Petitioner  DO  NOT  agree  on  all  the  terms  to  be  included  in  the 

Order Modifying Custody and Support, you will need to have a trial.   

A. 

Trial.  If you and the Petitioner cannot agree on all issues, your case will have to 

be heard and decided by a Judge at a trial.   

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

B. 

Request a trial date.  If the Petitioner has NOT done so, you will need to request 
a hearing by completing a Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  
Indicate  how  much  time  you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your 
evidence and write that in (usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether 
or not  you want  a Court reporter to record the proceeding.  SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS ON 
GETTING A COURT REPORTER. It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do 
not get a Court reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   
 

➢  You must file the Request for Setting and the Order Setting Modification Trial and 
Requesting Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the 
hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the other party.  You will need to 
provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Petitioner to the Clerk.   

nce a trial date has been set, do the following:

C. 

Pretrial  Disclosures. 

  Both  parties  must  provide  to  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.   
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Petitioner (or his/her attorney). 

 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before  the trial, you 
must present the Court with the completed and signed Order Modifying Custody and Support in 
writing before the Court will take the trial off of the schedule. There will be no continuances or 
canceling  of  the  trial  date  based  on  telephone  calls.    If  you  need  a  continuance,  you  should 
contact an attorney for assistance in seeking one.  

 

Court reporter.  If you wish to have a Court Reporter you are required to make a 
request by phone to the appropriate official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than 
three (3) working days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the court 
reporter  by  phone  or  by  submitting  a  written  request.      Please  note  that  if  providing  notice 
through the mail, the request must be received by the court reporter no later than three working 
days prior to the hearing.  The Clerk will be able to inform you which court reporter to contact.  
The three-day notice requirement will not be waived by the Court.  The notice is required for all 
civil matters including jury trials.  

• 

Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and  witnesses.    If  the  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and  Requesting  Pretrial  Statements  is 
entered  (signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the 
information  requested in that document, including  copies of exhibits  you want  to  introduce at 
the  trial  and  a  list  of  your  proposed  witnesses  and  what  their  testimony  is  going  to  be  about 
within the time frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge 
cannot help you or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 

 

Final  Decision  (Order).    Following  the  trial,  the  Judge  will  make  a  decision  or 
may  take  the  matter  under  advisement,  meaning  he  or  she  will  need  to  think  further  before 
making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type it into 
the  Order  Modifying  Custody  and  Support  incorporating  the  Judge’s  decision,  but  usually  the 
Petitioner or the Judge will prepare the Order.  

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Judge will not 
guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on 
the law.

D.  When will your custody and child support order be modified?  Your custody 
and child support order will not be modified until the Judge signs the Order and it is filed with 
the Clerk of Court.   This  process  may take time if the Judge  requires changes to  the proposed 
Order.  You must verify with the Clerk’s office that the Order has been file-stamped before you 
can  be  sure  your  child  support  order  has  been  modified.    The  time  limit  to  appeal  the  Order 
begins to run from the day the Order is filed with the Clerk’s office. 

 

RECAP for Respondent’s Documents:   

1.  File a Response or Response and Counterclaim within 20 days from the date you were served (or 
30  days  if  served  out  of  state).    If  you  file  a  Response  and  Counterclaim,  be  sure  to  attach  a 
certified copy of the prior custody order. 

•  Mail a copy to the Petitioner and keep a copy for your records 

2.  File a Confidential Financial Affidavit and the required attachments  

•  Mail a copy to the Petitioner and keep a copy for your records 

3.  Assist the Petitioner in filling out the Order Modifying Custody and Support if you both agree on 

all the terms.   

 

•  Sign the Order in front of a Notarial Officer. 

Your custody and child support order is modified when the Order has been signed by the Judge and filed by 
the Clerk. 

4. 

If  you  and  the  Petitioner  do  NOT  agree  on  all  of  the  terms,  and  a  trial  is  needed,  follow  these 
steps:   

a.  File  a  Request  for  Setting  and  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and  Requiring  Pretrial 

Statements ONLY if the Petitioner has NOT done so. 

b.  Take  an  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and 
Requiring  Pretrial  Statements  for  filing  with  the  Clerk  and  two  (2)  addressed,  stamped 
envelopes (one addressed to you and one to the  Petitioner with enough postage to cover 
the  cost  of  mailing  the  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and  Requiring  Pretrial 
Statements to you and the Petitioner).    

c.  File your Pretrial Disclosures 30 days before the trial date. 

•  Mail a copy to the Petitioner and keep a copy for your records (do not file with the 

Court) 

d.  No later than 3 working days before the trial, request a court reporter, if desired (and if 

the Petitioner has not already done so). 

e.  Attend the Trial 
f.  Complete and file any additional documents required by your Court. 

our custody and child support order is modified when the Order has been signed by the Judge and filed by 

the Clerk.
