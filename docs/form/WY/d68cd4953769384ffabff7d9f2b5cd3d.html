ONCE  FILED,  THE  PARTIES  MAY  ONLY  MAKE  SUBSTANTIAL,  PERMANENT 
MODIFICATIONS  TO  THIS  VISITATION  PLAN  BY  WRITTEN  AGREEMENT  SIGNED  BY 
BOTH PARTIES,  APPROVED BY THE JUDGE AND FILED WITH THE  COURT.   MINOR, 
TEMPORARY  CHANGES  MAY  BE  MADE  ANY  TIME  ONLY  IF  BOTH  PARTIES  AGREE 
TO THE CHANGES. 

The  child  support  amount  may  depend  on  the  custodial  arrangement  that  is  ordered by  the  court.    If 
each parent keeps the children overnight for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the year and both 
parents  contribute  substantially  to  the  expenses  of  the  children  in  addition  to  the  payment  of  child 
support,  a  “shared  responsibility  child  support”  obligation  shall  be  determined  by  use  of  the  tables.  
Also, when each parent has physical custody of at least one (1) of the children, a “shared responsibility 
child  support”  obligation  for  all  of  the  children  shall  be  determined  by  use  of  the  tables.    See  Wyo. 
Stat. §20-2-304(c) and (d).  For assistance in calculating child support, go to the following website:

enforcement agency.

  C.1.  Restriction on reducing amount of child support:  No agreement which is 
less than the presumed child support amount in the law shall be approved if public 
support/benefits  (such  as  aid  under  the  personal  opportunities  with  employment 
responsibilities 
food  stamps, 
(POWER)  program,  Title  19,  Kid  Care, 
supplemental  security  income  (SSI)  or  other  similar  benefits)  are  being  paid  on 
behalf of any of the child(ren).  CHECK ONE: 

 

   The child(ren) receive(s) public assistance; OR 
   The child(ren) DO NOT receive(s) any public assistance. 

 

  Defendant  shall  pay 
C.2.  Amount  of  Child  Support: 
$_________ per month for child support.  The amount of child support is based 
upon: 

  Plaintiff  OR 

    The  presumptive  amount  of  child  support  determined  by  Wyoming’s 

Child Support Guidelines; OR 

 upwards or 

   There is a deviation (an adjustment) 

 downwards from 
the presumptive amount. (In order to deviate, there must be a specific finding 
that  the  application  of  the  presumptive  child  support  would  be  unjust  or 
inappropriate).  The reasons that the presumptive amount is unjust is because

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
