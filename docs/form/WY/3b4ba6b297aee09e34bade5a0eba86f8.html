INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE PETITION FOR ORDER OF PROTECTION 

umbers to these instructions correspond to the same numbers on the Petition For Order 

Of Protection Form.  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.  

op of page for Petition for Order Of Protection 

If  you  are  filing  this  petition  requesting  the  protection  order,  you  are  the  Petitioner.  
Respondent is the person against whom an order is sought and the person alleged as 
the abuser.  

OU MUST BE AS THOROUGH, COMPLETE, AND DETAILED AS YOU POSSIBLY 
CAN,  BECAUSE  THE  COURT  MAY  DENY  YOUR  REQUEST  IF  THERE  IS 
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION. 

Petitioner’s information   

•  Petitioner’s Name:  LAST NAME, FIRST NAME, MIDDLE INITIAL.  Petitioner’s 

LAST name must be listed FIRST. 

•  Petitioner’s date of birth, race and sex must also be listed.  The date of birth will be 

blacked out and kept confidential by the clerk.  

•  Do NOT write your address here if you desire your whereabouts to remain 
undisclosed to the Respondent.  The court must be able to reach you by phone 
and  mail,  however,  your  safety  also  is  very  important.    If  you  do  not  want  the 
person  to  be  restrained  to  know  where  you  are,  you  can  write  in  a  friend’s  or 
relative’s address and phone number in the spaces provided for you, the Petitioner. 
Be sure to get this person’s permission first, and be sure the court can contact you 
with the provided information.  If a friend or relative is not appropriate to use in your 
situation,  and  you  still  desire  your  whereabouts  to  remain  confidential,  you  can 
write “confidential” in the provided spaces for your address and phone number.  If 
you do this, be sure to give the court your address and phone number in a separate 
envelope marked “confidential”.  All  boxed  areas  must  be  filled in. (The court 
shall, if requested by the Petitioner, order the address of the Petitioner and any 
children  of  the  Petitioner  and  Respondent  be  kept  confidential.  (Wyo.  Stat. 
35-21-105(e)). 

.  

Respondent’s information 

•  Please fill in this information to the best of your ability.  It is important to provide as 
much information as possible about the person against whom you are seeking this 
order.  The Respondent is also the alleged abuser. 

  Make sure you provide the Respondent’s full name (last, first and middle initial) 
and any other names used by the Respondent.  The date of birth will be blacked

please give an approximate age.  All boxed areas must be filled in. 
 

•  Be sure to list distinguishing marks, scars or tattoos and where they are located.   

•  Also,  if  you  know  the  Respondent’s  date  of  birth,  vehicle  identification  number, 
driver’s  license  number,  military  identification  number,  or  identification  card 
number, include them in your petition.  This will assist in registering the information 
in  the  statewide  registry  and  will  promote  enforcement  of  any  violations  of  the 
protection order. The date of birth, driver’s license number, military identification 
number or identification card number will be blacked out and kept confidential by 
the clerk.  
 

3.  •  Please list the docket number, judge’s name, and the court’s name of court cases 

that are related to this action, if any.

City, County and State  

•  Please indicate the City, County and State of your current residency on the first two 
lines  provided.    Also  designate  the  City,  County  and  State  in  which  the  acts  of 
domestic abuse set forth in paragraphs  eight (8) and nine (9) of the Petition for 
Order of Protection took place.  

.  

Your relationship with the Respondent 

It is important for the Court reviewing this petition to know the relationship between 
you and the Respondent.  Please circle all the boxes which describe your situation.  
You must meet at least one of the described relationships in order to qualify for 
protection under this law.  

.  

Children born of Petitioner and Respondent 

If you and the Respondent are parents of the same children, list the children’s full 
names,  (last,  first  and  middle),  date  of  birth,  race,  female/male,  with  whom  and 
where  they  are  living  at  the  present  time.    Do  NOT  list  the  address  of  the 
children  if  you  do  not  want  the  Respondent  to  know  their  whereabouts 
because  of  safety  concerns.  (The  court  shall,  if  requested  by  the  Petitioner, 
order  the  address  of  the  Petitioner  and  any  children  of  the  Petitioner  and 
Respondent to be kept confidential.  (Wyo. Stat. 35-21-105(e)).  Children’s names 
and dates of birth will be blacked out by the court and kept confidential so only their 
initials and year of birth will be listed.

•  Please describe in as much detail as possible the most recent incident in which 
you were threatened, hurt or restrained.  The more details you can provide such 
as  day,  place  and  time,  witnesses,  including  minor  children,  the  more 
helpful  it  is  for  the  Judge  to  make  a  determination.    Try  to  use  the 
Respondent’s  exact  words  when  you  were  threatened  with  physical  harm  and 
describe any physical abuse in detail.  For example, “On Sunday, March 15, 2002, 
at twelve midnight, Mark slapped my face with an open hand” rather than “On one 
Sunday  this  month  Mark  assaulted  me.”    If  weapons  were  involved,  explain  in 
detail.   

If  the  Respondent  has  a  criminal  history,  a  history  of  mental  illness,  substance 
and/or alcohol abuse, if prior protection orders have been issued and/or violated 
(include dates and case numbers if available), if threats have been made to take 
the  children,  if  Respondent  has  threatened  to  commit  suicide  or  to  kill  you,  the 
children, or others put that information in your Petition.   

 

  •

.  

History of Domestic Abuse in your relationship 

•  Please  describe  the  incidents  of  domestic  abuse  which  have  occurred  on  prior 
occasions  between  you  and  the  Respondent.    Include  any  incidents  that  have 
included others, such as your children or any incidents involving injury to animals 
or destruction of property by the Respondent.  Again, be as detailed as you can 
because  the  Judge  will  want  to  be  informed  about  the  history  of  abuse  in  your 
relationship with the Respondent.  This may help the judge determine the risk of 
further abuse to you. 

0. 

Firearms Possessed by the Respondent 

•  This information  is essential not  only  for your safety,  but for  the  safety  of  those 
involved  in  protecting  you,  including  law  enforcement.    Again,  be  as  specific as 
possible,  listing  any  specific  characteristics  of  the  firearms  and  where  they  are 
located or stored, including which room in a home, if known.  If any weapon was 
involved in the incident before the court, please describe. 

1.   Asking Court for an “Ex Parte Order” and for additional relief in an “Order of 

Protection” (valid for a period of time not to exceed three years) 

•  An  Ex  Parte  Order  (sometimes  referred  to  as  a  “temporary”  or  “emergency” 
protection order) is an order which may be immediately available upon the filing of 
your petition “if it appears from the specific facts shown by the affidavit or by the 
petition that there exists a danger of further domestic abuse.”  The order is issued 
without giving the other party a chance to tell his or her side of the story and is only 
valid for a short amount of time, usually until a hearing takes place.

Revised July 1, 2019 

•  Ex  Parte  Orders  of  Protection  may  not  contain  the  same  relief  that  you  are 
requesting from the Court in your Petition.  If you feel you need protection other 
than what is listed on the Ex Parte Order of Protection, you may ask for it by listing 
it in “other relief.”  For example, if you are concerned for your children’s safety 
or  welfare  pending  a  hearing,  ask  the  judge  to  consider  granting  you 
Temporary Custody in the Ex Parte Order pending a hearing on the Order of 
Protection.  (An Order of Protection, if granted, is valid for up to three years 
and  may,  under  certain  circumstances,  be  extended  with  the  Court’s 
approval.)    Children’s names and dates of birth will be blacked out by the court 
and kept confidential so only their initials and year of birth will be listed.  
 
If you obtain an Ex Parte Order of Protection, you MUST appear at the hearing for 
an Order of Protection on the date and time scheduled by the Court OR YOUR EX 
PARTE  ORDER  WILL  AUTOMATICALLY  EXPIRE.  There may be a domestic 
violence program in your area that can provide help.   

• 

•  The Ex Parte Order, if granted, will be valid for up to seventy-two (72) hours or until 
as soon thereafter as the petition may be heard by the court.  The judge will hold a 
hearing on the question of granting an Order of Protection (valid for up to  three 
years).   

If an Ex Parte or Temporary Order of Protection is denied for a reason other than 
sufficiency of the petition, the court shall serve notice to appear upon the parties 
and hold a hearing on the Petition for Order of Protection within 72 hours after the 
filing of the petition or as soon thereafter as the petition may be heard by the court. 
Again, you MUST appear at the hearing in order for the Judge to consider granting 
your requested Order.  

If an Order of Protection is not granted, you have the right to re-file and provide 
additional information. 

•  An  Order  of  Protection  may  be  granted  if  you  prove  your  allegations  at  the 
hearing.    This  Order  of  Protection  is  valid  for  a  specific  period  of  time,  but  not 
longer than three years (unless extended by the Courts). 

•  You MUST be prepared to prove your allegations at the hearing.  At the hearing, 
the judge will allow both sides and attorneys, if any, a chance to speak.  You may 
call  witnesses  and  present  evidence  if  you  wish.  If  you  have  copies  of  medical 
records  from  seeking  treatment  for  injuries  caused  by  the  alleged  abuser  or 
photographs of the injuries or damage to property, answering machine tapes or 
recordings of threats made by the alleged abuser against you or others close to 
you, bring them with you to the hearing.  Remember, the judge knows nothing 
about your case, except what you provide in court. 
 

•  You may want to request the court require the Respondent to pay costs and fees 
incurred in bringing an action pursuant to this act including reasonable attorney's 
fees whether the attorney is court appointed or retained by Petitioner.  

•

If after the hearing, the judge issues an Order of Protection, it shall be effective for 
a fixed period of time not to exceed three years.  Make sure any Order contains an 
expiration date.   

  The Protection Order replaces the Ex Parte Protection Order if one was issued, but 
cannot modify, change or amend child custody, child support or property issues 
from previously entered Orders in other courts (i.e. Divorce Decrees or Paternity 
cases).    If  you  have  copies  of  any  previous  or  current  Orders  from  any  Court 
involving  you,  the  Respondent  and/or  any  children  listed,  please  provide  those 
orders, the date issued and from which court they were issued. 
 

•  Protective Orders may provide for any and all the following demands, restraints 
and provisions stated in letters (A) through (Q).  Please check the box of any letter 
from (A) through (P) which you desire to obtain.  Add any additional request in (Q), 
if necessary.  For example, if you are concerned the Respondent may cancel your 
mail service or insurance coverage, shut off your utilities or enter your residence, 
ask the judge to order him or her not to do these things.   

•  The  order  may  be  extended  repetitively  for  good  cause  upon  motion  of  the 
Petitioner for additional periods of time not to exceed three years each. The forms 
necessary  to  extend  an  Order  of  Protection  are  also  available  at  the  Clerk  of 
Court’s office and are usually part of the packet you receive when you request an 
Application  for  a  Domestic  Violence  Protection  Order.    You  may  not  extend  an 
Order once it has expired, so, when possible, request an Extension at least 7 to 10 
days prior to the current Order expiring. 

•  Next, you will need to sign the Petition for an Order for Protection in the presence 
of the Clerk of Court or in front of a notarial officer prior to having them file stamped 
and served on the Respondent.  The Clerk or a notarial officer will also sign the 
petition to verify your signature. 

•  You are advised that perjury is a felony punishable by imprisonment or a fine or 

both.  Be both honest and detailed in your Petition.  

•  Ask  the  Clerk  of  Court  to  give  you  certified  copies  of  any  Order  of  Protection, 
including  an  Ex  Parte (Emergency  or Temporary)  Order of  Protection  if  granted 
and the Order of Protection (valid for up to three years) when granted (usually after 
the hearing).  

•  Make as many copies as necessary for home, work, schools, daycare providers, 
etc. (if you were ordered temporary care and custody of the minor children or if the 
Respondent  was  ordered  to  have  no  contact  or  limited  contact  with  the  minor 
children).  
 

•  Carry a copy of any Order of Protection with you at all times.  

•
