All  underlined  forms  are  required  in  a  divorce  with  children  action  where  the  parties 
agree on all of the issues.  The rest of the documents required to be filed with the Clerk to 
complete  the  divorce  action  are  contained  in  the  Plaintiff’s  Packet.    It  is  recommended 
that you work with the Plaintiff to ensure all necessary forms are filled out correctly and 
completely.  You will also need to sign the Decree of Divorce that is contained in the 
Plaintiff’s  Packet  before  your  divorce  can  be  completed  if  you  agree  on  all  of  the 
issues. 
**Other forms may be required by your Court.

OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” litigants.  This packet is often referred to as 
the “pro se divorce packet.”  These packets work best when parties are able to agree and 
become  more  difficult  when  there  are  children,  disagreements  about  property,  financial 
interests,  violence,  harassment  or  coercion.  Many  areas  of  family  law  are  very  
complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming require certain things that others 
courts  do  not.    Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  include  all  legal  solutions  available  to 
people in a divorce action in a single packet.  Again, this packet will be most useful for 
people involved in an uncontested divorce (i.e., you both agree on all matters).  There 
are other types of actions available, including temporary orders on child custody, support, 
alimony and restraining orders that are not included in this packet and might be easier to 
obtain with an attorney.  These forms have been created to  benefit the majority of people 
who  represent  themselves  while  also  understanding  that  people  with  complex  or 
emergency  circumstances  may  continue  to  find  themselves  better  served  by  getting  an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, it is recommended that you find 
an  attorney  to  help  you.      There  may  be  assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.  
Contact the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Legal 
Aid of Wyoming ( 1-877-432-9955) or the Wyoming State Bar (1-307-632-9061) www.wyomingbar.org.  
If  you  have  concerns  about  confidential  information  such  as  addresses  and/or  social  security  numbers, 
please  consult  an  attorney  and  do  not  attempt  to  do  this  on  your  own.  You  should  also  know  that 
Protection  Orders  and  Stalking  Orders  are  available  free  of  charge  at  the  circuit  court  clerk’s  office.   
Please  call  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against  Domestic  Violence  &  Sexual  Assault  for  assistance  in 
obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a 
protection order involving your spouse, you should include this information in the Complaint for Divorce 
or Counterclaim under the “Other Proceedings” section.  

   

   

 

 

 

This  information  packet  is  intended  to  provide  general  information  to  obtain  a 
divorce.  
There  is  no  guarantee  these  forms  are  still  accurate  and/or  current.    The 
information in this packet is not intended to replace an attorney.   
If  you represent  yourself, YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You must 
decide which forms apply to your situation.   
DO NOT USE all forms, as some forms may not apply.   
Fill out the necessary forms completely and correctly.   

Print  or  type  all  of  the  documents.  DO  NOT  SIGN  YOUR  NAME  WHERE 

THE JUDGE OR CLERK SHOULD SIGN.

LAWS:    All  laws  and rules  that  apply  to  attorneys  apply  to  you.    It  is  your 
responsibility to properly prepare and file the necessary documents.  The Judge will not 
sign orders that are incorrect or incomplete, nor will the Judge give you legal advice 
or make corrections for you. 

ou  should  read  Title  20  of  the  Wyoming  Statutes  (the  divorce  laws),  and  you 
should also read the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.  Most of the District Courts in 
the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these laws and 
rules  can  be  read.    You  may  also  look  up  these  laws  and  rules  on  the  internet  at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library.”  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks May Not Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Unless your county has a court 
facilitator,  employees  in  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  and  in  the  Judge’s  office 
cannot help you or give you legal advice.     

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte communication is communication with the Judge with only one party present.     If 
you  have  something  you  need  to  tell  the  Judge,  you  must  ask  for  a  hearing  and  give 
notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and send a copy of 
the written statement to the other party. 

ituations  that  Need  an  Attorney.    Federal  law  may  impact  the  division  of 
retirement benefits, employer-provided health insurance, or other benefits which arise out 
of the employment of either party, and your settlement terms may not be honored by the 
employer or the plan administrator of the employee benefits plan if your divorce decree is 
not properly completed or if a “qualified domestic relations order” (QDRO) is required.  
In addition, in the division of retirement benefits, there may be tax consequences which 
you  may  not  anticipate.    If  your  divorce  involves  issues  like  these,  see  an  attorney  to 
discuss tax consequences or the terms of a QDRO, or, if dealing with insurance issues, a 
“qualified medical child support order.”   

n addition to the above situations, you should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence  
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You or the other party are contemplating filing bankruptcy 
  You  or  the  other  party  expect  to  receive  money  because  of  a  personal 

injury 

  You or the other party own a business 
  You or the other party have significant assets or debts 
  You or the other party own real estate 

ruthfulness.    It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.

You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury). 

nauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those  persons  who  are  doing  their  own  divorce.    It  may  be  an  unauthorized  practice  of 
law  for  a  person  who  is  not  a  licensed  attorney  to  assist  others  in  obtaining  a  divorce.  
Such practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou are reminded that if you choose to continue without an attorney, you are 
expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has said: 
“A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any other 
litigant  and  he  must  expect  and  receive…the  same  treatment  as  if  represented  by  an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

FAMILY LAW INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

   

 CONFIDENTIALITY:  If you have concerns about keeping information confidential, such as 
your address and/or social security number, please consult an attorney.  You should also know 
that Domestic Violence Protection Orders or Stalking Orders are available free of charge at the 
circuit  court  clerks’  offices.    You  may  request  assistance  in  obtaining  Domestic  Violence 
Protection  or  Stalking  Orders  from  your  local  domestic  violence  or  sexual  assault  program  or 
you may call the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-
0992).  There are also private attorneys who may be willing to assist clients in these matters.   If 
you  have  ever  obtained  a  Protection  Order  against  the  other  party,  this  information  should  be 
indicated in the Complaint for Divorce or the Counterclaim.    

ead through the following information and instructions before completing the forms. You 
must fill out all forms as completely as possible.  If your forms are not complete, the Judge 
may reject your packet.   

  divorce  action  starts  with  the  filing  of  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    A  Complaint  for 
Divorce is a written request to the court for a divorce.  The person who originally asks for this 
legal  action is  called the  Plaintiff and remains  the Plaintiff throughout  the case.   The  Plaintiff 
will file the Complaint for Divorce with the Clerk of the District Court, whose office is usually 
located  in  the  county  courthouse  or  a  branch  of  the  county  courthouse.    A  case  number,  also 
called  a  civil  action  number,  is  assigned  and  an  official  court  file  is  opened.    Delivering  the 
Complaint for Divorce to the Clerk’s office is called filing a case.   

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.” The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and complaint stating the name of 
the Plaintiff, Defendant, the District Court the case is filed in and the case number. 

  A

 

     

nformation:   

Once  a  case  has  been  filed,  a  copy  must  be  formally  given  to  (a/k/a  served  on)  the 
Defendant.   The person  against whom the original  legal  action is  being requested is  called the 
Defendant,  and  he  or  she  is  expected  to  answer  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    The  Defendant 
remains the Defendant throughout the case.  Personal service of the Complaint for Divorce and 
Summons  on  the  Defendant  by  a  Sheriff  is  required  for  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  unless  the 
Defendant completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form.  Formal service is 
required for the  Complaint for  Divorce so  that the Court has  proof that the  Defendant actually 
received the papers.  Other forms of service exist, but these are the easiest methods that meet the 
formal service requirement for a Complaint for Divorce.

wo options exist – you may either answer the Complaint for Divorce or answer and file a 

counterclaim.  Both options are explained below: 
 

PTION A.  Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce.      If  you  have  been  served  or  have 
signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form,  you  should  file  an  Answer  to 
Complaint  for  Divorce  with  the  Clerk  of  District  Court  where  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  was 
filed.    An  Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce  is  a  written  document  explaining  to  the  court 
exactly which provisions you agree with and which provisions you deny. If you fail to answer, a 
default judgment may be entered against you and your spouse may be entitled the relief he or she 
asked for in the Complaint for Divorce.  

  O

 

You must fill in the caption.  DO NOT forget to include the case number.  This is located in the 
caption of the Summons and/or Complaint for Divorce. 
  
 

i. 
Admit  or  Deny.    To  answer  the  papers,  you  should  go  through  each  and  every 
paragraph of the Complaint for Divorce and either “admit” or “deny” each paragraph.  If 
you do not have sufficient information to either admit or deny a particular allegation, you 
must state that in your Answer to Complaint for Divorce.  If you disagree with something 
and you fail to “deny” it in your Answer to Complaint for Divorce, the Judge can find that 
you admitted it. 
 
ii. 
Time  limit  to  answer.    You  have  only  a  limited  amount  of  time  to  file  an 
Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce.    Generally,  if  you  were  served  within  the  State  of 
Wyoming,  you  will  have  20  days  to  file  the  Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce.    If  you 
were  served  outside  the  State  of  Wyoming,  you  generally  will  have  30  days  to  file  an 
Answer to Complaint for Divorce.  If you do not file an Answer to Complaint for Divorce 
by  your  deadline,  then  your  spouse  may  obtain  a  Decree  of  Divorce  giving  him/her 
everything he/she requested in the Complaint for Divorce. 

iii. 
Computation of Time Limits.  In computing most time limits, unless otherwise 
stated, the day the pleading is served shall not be included. The last day of the period so 
computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, when 
the  act  to  be  done  is  the  filing  of  a  paper,  a  day  on  which  weather  or  other  conditions 
have made the office of the clerk of the court inaccessible, in which event the period runs 
until  the  end  of  the  next  day  which  is  not  one  of  the  aforementioned  days.  When  the 
period  of  time  prescribed  or  allowed  is  less  than  11  days,  intermediate  Saturdays, 
Sundays,  and  legal  holidays  shall  be  excluded  in  the  computation.  A  "legal  holiday" 
includes any day officially recognized as a legal holiday in this state by designation of the 
legislature or appointment as a holiday by the governor.

NOTE:  If you have any question or concerns as to when the deadline to file the Answer to 
Complaint for Divorce is, you should consult an attorney. 
 

iv. 
REQUIRED  INFORMATION  FOR  CHILDREN:  Certain  information  is 
required  to  be  given  under  oath  for  each  child,  unless  you  have  a  court  order  or  are 
operating  under  another  law  allowing  you  to  maintain  confidentiality  of  addresses  or 
other identifying information.  If the information is not provided, the court, upon motion 
of a party or its own motion, may stop the case from going forward until the information 
is  provided.  The  information  necessary  is  included  in  the  Answer  and  the  Answer  and 
Counterclaim. 

Notarizing  Signatures:    You  will  need  to  sign  the  Answer  to  Complaint  for 
. 
Divorce  and  have  it  notarized.    Notarial  Officers  may  administer  the  oath  and  witness 
your  signature,  or  in  many  cases,  clerks  of  court  will  be  willing  to  administer  the 
necessary oath.  Each clerk’s office has their own policy so check with them first before 
seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.   

i. 
Certificate  of  Service:    Copies  of  all  documents  sent  to  or  filed  with  the  court 
must  be  sent  to  the  Plaintiff  before  the  judge  will  consider  them.    This  certificate  is 
included at the end of each document that requires it.   

ii.  Copies:  Make two (2) copies of the document.  The original will be filed by the 
Clerk  of  District  Court,  one  copy  is  for  the  Plaintiff  and  the  other  copy  is  for  you  (the 
Defendant).  You will need to repeat this step for all documents you file with the Clerk’s 
office.   

OPTION B.  Answer  and  Counterclaim  for  Divorce.    If  you  want  the  Judge  to  grant 
relief to you (for example, give you the divorce, award property to you, order your spouse to pay 
alimony, take your previous last name back, etc.) you should file an Answer and Counterclaim 
for Divorce.  An Answer and Counterclaim for Divorce responds to the Complaint for Divorce 
and gives you an opportunity to tell the court what you want to happen with the divorce.  First, 
you will go through each and every paragraph of the Complaint for Divorce and either “admit” 
or “deny” each paragraph.  Second, the Counterclaim for Divorce portion of the document asks 
the Judge to give you what you want.  You must fill out all of the information in the Answer and 
Counterclaim for Divorce completely. 
 

i 
Restoration of Wife’s previous name:  The wife should state whether or not she 
would  like  to  resume  her  prior  name  in  either  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  if  she  is  the 
Plaintiff, or in a Counterclaim if she is the Defendant.  This is the wife’s choice ONLY; 
the husband cannot demand that his wife’s name be changed.

NOTE:  If you have any question or concerns as to when the deadline to file the Answer and 
Counterclaim for Complaint for Divorce is, you should consult an attorney. 
 

iii. 

Plaintiff’s  Reply  to  Your  Counterclaim.    The  Plaintiff  must  reply  to  the 
Counterclaim.  If you file a Counterclaim, the Plaintiff will have 20 days to “reply” by filing a 
Reply to Counterclaim.  The Plaintiff will either admit or deny the  separate allegations in  your 
Counterclaim.    If  the  Plaintiff  fails  to  reply  to  the  Counterclaim,  you  may  be  entitled  to  file 
Default paperwork seeking the relief you request in your Counterclaim.  
  

TEP 2.  Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Defendant’s Answer is required to be 
served on the Plaintiff (use the table in 2.A. below to determine date).  The information consists 
of  a  schedule  of  financial  assets;  schedule  of  non-financial  assets;  schedule  of  all  debts  owed 
individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information; 
information  regarding  other  income  and  retirement  accounts;  and  a  summary  of  the  facts 
believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child custody is at issue.  
Both  parties  are  required  to  provide  this  information  in  order  to  fully  disclose  finances  of  the 
parties relating to the calculation of child support.   

.  If  you  were  served  in  Wyoming,  add  20  days  to  the  date  in  #1:

2.  Next, determine when you are required to file an Answer: 

A.  WHEN TO PROVIDE:  Initial Disclosures must be provided to the Plaintiff (or 
his/her attorney) WITHIN 30 DAYS  AFTER YOUR  ANSWER  IS  REQUIRED TO BE 
SERVED ON PLAINTIFF  (use table below).    Be sure  to keep a  copy of your Initial 
Disclosures form for your records.  Use the following to determine the date when you 
and the Plaintiff are required to provide initial disclosures to one another.     
 

1.  Begin  with 

the  date  you  were 

served  with 

the  Complaint: 

b.  If  you  signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service,  add  20 

days to the date in #1:  ___________________________ 

c.  If you were served out-of-state, add 30 days to the date in #1:  

OR 

 __________________________ 
 

3.  Add 30 days to the date in #2(a), (b), or (c):  ___________________________ 

he  date  set  forth  in  #3  is  the  date  by  which  you  and  the  Plaintiff  must  provide  your 

completed Initial Disclosures forms to one another. 

  T

__________________________ 
OR 

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably

form is only given to the Plaintiff (or his/her attorney). 
 

STEP 3.  Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit.  

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit with the court 

with all the necessary supporting documentation.   
 

•  Required Attachments.  The Confidential Financial Affidavit must be supported 
with  documentation  of  both  current  and  past  earnings.  Proper  documentation  of 
current earnings includes, but is not limited to pay stubs, employer statements, or 
receipts  and  expenses if self-employed. Documentation  of current  earnings shall 
be supplemented with copies of the most recent tax return to provide verification 
of  earnings  over  a  longer  period.  Include  copies  of  income  tax  returns  for  the 
previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to show how much you have 
made so far this year.  

•  The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit  may  be  filed  with  the  Clerk’s  office  at  the 

same time you file your Answer or Answer and Counterclaim.   

TEP 4. 

If you and the Plaintiff agree on all the terms in the Decree of Divorce, the Decree 
will  need  to  be  filled  out  completely,  signed  by  both  you  and  the  Plaintiff  and  both  of  your 
signatures must be notarized.  In addition to signing the Decree, you should initial each page 
of the Decree to verify that each page contains the terms you agreed upon.   Here is some 
important information about the Decree of Divorce: 

•  Custody and Visitation.  You and the Plaintiff need to determine which custody 
and visitation plan will apply in  your  circumstances.  It is unusual for the Court 
not to award any visitation or supervised visitation for the non-custodial parent.  
 

o 

 If  there  is  a  concern  that  your  child(ren)  may  be  harmed  by  the  other 
parent  physically  and/or  emotionally,  you  should  seek  advice  from 
someone  familiar  with  parenting  and  child  development  issues.    There 
may  be  an  organization  in  your  community  that  can  help  facilitate 
visitation between the children and you or the other parent.   You can also 
contact  the  facilitators  of  any  parenting  classes  in  your  community  for 
ideas or additional resources.   

•  Factors to be considered for awarding custody and visitation.  The Decree of 
Divorce contains several options for custody and visitation arrangements.  Ideally, 
both  parents  will  work  together  to  select  the  proper  custody  and  visitation  plan

depending upon the family circumstances.   In awarding custody and setting forth 
a  visitation  plan,  Wyoming  law  requires  that  the  Court  consider  the  following 
factors: 

 
The geographic location of each parent; 
Each  parent's  willingness  and  ability  to  perform  the  child  care 
duties  associated  with  the  child(ren),  relative  to  the  child(ren)'s 
stage of development such as feeding, changing, bathing, preparing 
the  child(ren)  for  school,  taking  responsibility  for  the  child(ren)'s 
homework, etc.; 
Each parent's ability to care for the child(ren)'s needs (consider not 
only historical involvement but a parent's willingness and ability to 
learn the necessary skills, as well); 
The lack of hostility between the parents; 
The  ability  of  both  parents'  work  schedules  and  the  child(ren)'s 
schedule to accommodate extended access; 
The child(ren)'s age(s) and strength of attachment to each parent; 
The child(ren)'s relationship with his/her friends. 
 

•  Child(ren)’s  interests  should  control.    The  use  of  a  calendar  for  scheduling 
purposes  is  highly  recommended.    The  parents'  work  schedules  and  the 
child(ren)'s  school  and  extracurricular  activities  need  to  be  considered  when 
developing a visitation plan.  This is especially true for those parents who do not 
enjoy  a  traditional  work  week.    While  visitation  should  be  an  enjoyable  and 
enriching experience, it is an obligation and responsibility for each parent as well 
as a right and a privilege.  Both parents must also have a good faith commitment 
to developing and carrying out a visitation plan.  You need to focus on what type 
of schedule would be in the child(ren)’s best interest.    

•  Parenting  classes.  At  any  time,  the  Court  may  require  parents  to  attend 
appropriate  parenting  classes,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  parenting  classes  to 
lessen the effects of divorce on children.  Both  parents are generally required to 
attend  classes  when  they  are  ordered.    If  the  class  is  ordered,  you  MUST  file  a 
Certificate of Completion with the Clerk’s office.  This certificate is provided by 
the class instructor. 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support due based upon the Confidential Financial Affidavits you and the Plaintiff 
completed.    You  may  use  the  Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to 
help you calculate the support due.  Another option is to go online to: 
https://childsupport.wyoming.gov/calculator/index.html 
to calculate child support. 
 

➢  You CANNOT agree that no support will be paid.  The statutes allow 
for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical custody

  F

and each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than forty percent 
(40%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the expenses 
of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   
 

➢  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include the specific reasons for deviation in the Decree of Divorce.  
 

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  MEDICAID  (TITLE  19),  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the net income of you and the Plaintiff even if you and 
the Plaintiff agree to a lower amount of support. 

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support,  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to  pay for 
expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for 
which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Plaintiff  and  50%  to 
Defendant). 

• 

When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk of Court.  This process may take 
time  if  the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk’s 
office that the Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before  you can be sure your divorce is 
final.  The time limit to appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed 
with the Clerk’s office.

STEP 5.  If you and the Plaintiff do NOT agree on all issues of your 
divorce, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

Trial.  If you and the Plaintiff cannot agree on all issues, your case will have to be 

heard and decided by a Judge at a trial.   

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

B. 

Request a trial date.  If the Plaintiff has NOT done so, you will need to request a 
hearing by completing a Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  
Indicate  how  much  time  you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your 
evidence and write that in (usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether 
or not  you want  a Court reporter to record the proceeding.  SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS ON 
GETTING A COURT REPORTER.  If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a 
transcript of the hearing will not be available.  It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if 
you do not get a Court reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   
 

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and 
Requesting Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the 
hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the other party.  You will need to 
provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Plaintiff to the Clerk.   

nce a trial date has been set, do the following: 

  O

 

C. 

Pretrial  Disclosures.  -    Both  parties  must  provide  to  the  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.   
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Plaintiff (or his/her attorney). 

 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that  your case settles before the trial, you 
must present the Court with the completed and signed Decree of Divorce in writing before the 
Court will take the trial off of the schedule. There will be no continuances or canceling of the 
trial date based on telephone calls.  If you need a continuance,  you should contact an attorney 
for assistance in seeking one.  

• 

Court reporter.  If you wish to have a Court reporter you are required to provide 
notice  to  the  official  Court  reporter  as  soon  as  possible,  but  at  least  three  (3)  working  days 
before the matter is set for hearing. You can provide notice to the court reporter by phone or by 

 

  •

amily Law Information and Instructions 

  F

Revised September 2019 
Page 8 of 10 
 

submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the mail, the request 
must be received by the court reporter at least three working days prior to the hearing.  The Clerk 
will be able to inform you which court reporter to contact.  The three-day notice requirement will 
not be waived by the Court.  The notice is required for all civil matters including jury trials.     
 

• 

Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Divorce Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered 
(signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the  information 
requested in that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a 
list  of  your proposed  witnesses and what  their testimony is  going to  be about  within the time 
frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you 
or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 

 

Final Decision (Decree of Divorce).  Following the trial, the Judge will make a 
decision or may take the matter under advisement, meaning he or she will need to think further 
before making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type 
it into the Decree of Divorce incorporating the Judge’s decision. 

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are  expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The judge  will  not 
guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on 
the law. 

• 

When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk of Court.  This process may take 
time  if  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree  are  required  by  the  Judge.    You  must  verify  with  the 
Clerk’s  office  that  the  Decree  of  Divorce  has  been  file-stamped  before  you  can  be  sure  your 
divorce  is  final.    The  time  limit  to  appeal  a  decree  begins  to  run  from  the  day  the  Decree  of 
Divorce is filed with the Clerk’s office.

A NOTE ABOUT MARITAL vs. NON-MARITAL ASSETS AND DEBTS 
 

In the following tables you will be asked to distinguish marital property/debt from non-marital 
(separate) property/debt.  Marital property/debt will be divided between you and your spouse as 
part of the divorce; non-marital property/debt usually will not be divided (depending on the 
situation). 

he general rule is that marital property and debt is any property or debt acquired during the 
marriage for the benefit of the marriage, regardless of who paid for it or whose name is on it. 
However, just because a party acquired property before marriage does not necessarily mean that 
it won’t be considered marital property. A spouse's premarital separate property can become 
marital when a married couple demonstrates an intent, through their words or actions during 
marriage, to treat one spouse's separate property as marital property. Gifts and inheritances are 
generally separate property, although gifts for the benefit of the marriage, such as a dishwasher, 
may be considered marital property. 

During the marriage" generally means from the time of marriage until the time of separation. 

eople often dispute what property/debt is marital or how long the marriage lasted. When this 
happens, you are urged to consult with an attorney to learn about the various legal arguments that 
may be available to you.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
