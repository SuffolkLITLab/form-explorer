      <pre>OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” or “pro per” litigants.  Although there has 
been  a  recent  surge  of  pro  se  litigation  in  our  courts,  there  are  additional  barriers  that 
people  without  an  attorney  will  inevitably  face,  especially  in  the  area  of  family 
law/domestic relations.  The difficulties increase when there are children, disagreements 
about  property,  financial  interests,  violence,  harassment  or  coercion.  Many  areas  of 
family law are very diverse and complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming 
require certain things that others courts do not.  That is why it is impractical to include all 
legal remedies available to people in family law cases in a single packet.  Therefore, this 
packet  will  be  most  beneficial  for  people involved  in  an  uncontested  case  (i.e.,  you 
both  agree  on  the  issues).  There  are  other  remedies  available,  including  temporary 
orders  on  child  custody,  support,  and  restraining  orders  that  are  not  included  in  this 
packet and may be best pursued with the assistance of an attorney.  The Citizen’s Access 
to Courts Committee is aware of the barriers that exist for low income people in our legal 
system and have created the forms in a manner that they believe will benefit the majority 
of people who represent themselves while also understanding that people with complex 
or emergency circumstances may continue to find themselves better served by getting an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, there are concerns above and 
beyond the normal concerns.  It is recommended that you obtain a lawyer to help you.    There may be 
assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.    Contact  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against 
Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Wyoming Legal Services (1-877-432-9955) or 
the  Wyoming  State  Bar  (1-307-632-9061)  www.wyomingbar.org.    If  you  have  concerns  about 
confidential information such as addresses and/or social security numbers, please consult an attorney and 
do not attempt to do this on your own. You should also know that Protection Orders and Stalking Orders 
are available free of charge at the circuit court clerk’s office.   Please call the Wyoming Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault for assistance in obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking 
orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a protection order involving the Respondent in this 
action,  this  information  should  be  included  in  the  Petition  to  Establish  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child 
Support or the Counterclaim under other actions.     
 

   

   

 

 

 

This  information  packet  is  intended  to  provide  general  information  to  help  you 
complete  the  forms  and  to  take  the  steps  the  law  requires  for  you  to  obtain  an 
Order Establishing Custody, Visitation and Child Support. There is no guarantee 
these forms are still accurate and/or current.  The information in this packet is not 
intended to replace an attorney.   
If  you represent  yourself, YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You must 
decide which forms apply to your situation.   
DO NOT USE each and every form, as some forms say opposite things.   
For  each  form  you  decide  to  use,  make  sure  you  fill  it  out  completely  and 
correctly.  If your forms are not complete, the Judge may reject your packet.

NO  ONE  in  the  Judge’s  office  or  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  can  help 
complete them.  Questions or problems may require the help of an attorney. 

 

 

Where  you  are  requested  to  provide  information,  use  the  blank  spaces  by  either 
typing or printing with blue or black ink.  You must print clearly.  If the judge cannot 
read what you write, the Judge will return the documents.  DO NOT SIGN YOUR 
NAME WHERE THE JUDGE OR CLERK SHOULD SIGN. 

AWS:  IF  YOU  DO  THIS  YOURSELF,  you  must  follow  the  law  as  if  you 
were  a  lawyer.    It  is  your  responsibility  to  properly  prepare  and  file  the  necessary 
documents.    The  Judge  will  not  sign  orders  or  decrees  that  are  incorrect  or 
incomplete, nor will the Judge give you legal advice or make corrections for you. 

ou should read Title 20 of the Wyoming Statutes (the domestic relations laws), 
and  you should  also  read the Wyoming Rules of Civil  Procedure.  Most of the District 
Courts in the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these 
laws and rules can be read.  You may also look up these laws and rules on the internet at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library.”  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this  packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks of Court Cannot Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Employees in the Clerk 
of District Court’s office and in the Judge’s office cannot help you or advise you; if you 
represent yourself, you are on your own.    

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte  communication  is  communication  with  the  Judge  with  only  one  party  present.  
Judges  are  not  allowed  to  engage  in  ex  parte  communication  except  in  very  limited 
circumstances,  so,  absent  specific  authorization  to  the  contrary,  you  should  not  try  to 
speak with or write to the Judge in your case unless the other party is present or has been 
properly notified.  If you have something you need to tell the Judge, you must ask for a 
hearing and give notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and 
send a copy of the written statement to the other party. 

ituations that Need an Attorney.  You should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence.  
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You  do  not  understand  the  Court  process  or  are  having  difficulty  in 

completing the forms. 

ruthfulness.    It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.  
You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury).

Unauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those persons who are doing their own custody case.  It may be an unauthorized practice 
of law for a person who is not a licensed attorney to assist others in a legal action.  Such 
practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou  are  reminded  that,  if  you  choose  to  continue  without  an  attorney,  you 
are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has 
said: “A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any 
other litigant and he must expect and receive…the same treatment as if represented by an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
