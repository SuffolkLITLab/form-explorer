include more than one incident.  

-5.  Set  forth  the  specific  relief  you  desire  from  the  Court  including  locations  with 
addresses  you  wish  to  have  the  court  order  the  Respondent  to  avoid,  and,  if 
appropriate, on the lines indicated, set forth the names of other members of your 
family you wish to have included in the Order of Protection.  

Respondent's Personal Information: 

This section of the document is for the Court’s information in order to identify the 
Respondent  and  to  have  the  Respondent  served  with  the  petition  by  law 
enforcement officials. 

Fill in the Respondent’s information with name, address, employment and 
address  of  employment,  together  with  other  descriptive  information 
requested. 

ou must date, sign and verify the Petition before a notarial officer or clerk of court 

where the petition is to be filed.  

ROCEDURE FOR STALKING ORDER OF PROTECTION 

The petition is filed with the Court and if the Court finds there is a clear and present 
danger of continued harassment an Ex parte Temporary Order of Protection will 
be issued and served on the Respondent.  An ex parte order is an order that is 
entered  after  the  court  considers  the  Petitioner's  information  only.    The 
Respondent will get notice of the allegations and will have an  opportunity  to  be 
heard by the court at the hearing. 

You  should  be  prepared  to  present  witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  prove  the 
stalking allegations at the hearing.  The stalking protection order hearings are held 
within 72 hours of filing the petition, or as soon thereafter as the court may hear the 
case.  The Respondent must receive notice of the hearing from the Sheriff at least 
twenty-four (24) hours before the hearing or it may be rescheduled to a later date. 
You may have to contact the clerk of the circuit court where you filed the petition to 
make  sure  that  the  Respondent  received  proper notice  of  the  hearing.    The  Ex 
parte Temporary Order of Protection will include terms the Court deems necessary 
and sufficient to protect the Petitioner and other persons and will contain a date 
and time within seventy-two (72) hours, or as soon thereafter as the matter may be 
heard, for a hearing on the petition. 

If the Court finds from the evidence at the hearing that stalking has occurred, an 
Order  of  Protection  will  be  issued  for  up  to  three  years,  containing  terms  and 
conditions prohibiting further stalking.

If the judge gives you a Stalking Protection Order, it will be in effect for up to three 
years and you may ask the court to extend the order upon a showing of good cause for 
additional periods of time not to exceed three years each.  The Respondent may object 
to  the  extension  and  another  hearing  may  be  set.    Judges  may  differ  on  what  they 
consider "good cause."  In the event you desire an extension of the Order of Protection, 
the request for extension must be filed prior to the expiration of the original order and 
must contain information for the Court to consider in determining whether to extend the 
original  order.    It  would  be  a  good  idea  not  to  wait  until  the  last  minute  to  ask  for  an 
extension.  You may want to contact an attorney for advice prior to filing for an extension. 

MERGENCY ASSISTANCE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT 

  E

 
A victim of stalking may request the assistance of law enforcement agencies which 
may take necessary steps to protect the victim including advisement of the remedies in 
Wyoming Statutes §7-3-506 through 7-3-512, advising the victim, when appropriate, of 
the procedure for initiating a stalking action or criminal proceedings and providing for or 
arranging for transportation of the victim to a medical facility or place of shelter.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
