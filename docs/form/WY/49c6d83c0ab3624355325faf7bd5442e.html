GENERAL INFORMATION 

•  The  Court  must  award  a  money  judgment  in  favor  of  the  Judgment  Creditor  before  a 

• 

garnishment may be requested. 
It is not the Court’s responsibility to collect a money judgment for the Judgment Creditor 
to satisfy a judgment. 

•  For additional information, please review the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.  

Continuing Garnishment: The exclusive procedure for withholding the earnings of a Judgment 
Debtor for successive pay periods for payment of a judgment obtained by the Judgment Creditor. 
In Wyoming, a Continuing Garnishment is effective for 90 days. 

Exempt Earnings:  The amount of earnings of the Judgment Debtor that cannot be garnished.   

Garnishee(s): The person, company or other entity the Writ is being served upon; typically, the 
Judgment Debtor’s employer or financial institution.  

Judgment Creditor(s): The person(s), company or other entity who should receive the money as 
ordered by the Court. 

Judgment Debtor(s): The person(s), company or other entity who owes the money as ordered by 
the Court. 

Non-Continuing  Garnishment:  The  exclusive  procedure  for  withholding  the  earnings  of  a 
Judgment Debtor.  In Wyoming, a Non-Continuing Garnishment is effective for up to 30 days. 

Satisfaction of Judgment: The document stating the Judgment Debtor has satisfied the judgment. 
Wyoming Statute requires this to be filed by the Judgment Creditor with the Circuit Court Clerk 
in order to remove the judgment from credit reports as being unpaid by the Judgment Debtor. The 
satisfaction can be “Full” or “Partial.”

courthouse. A list of the Circuit Court Clerk’s office for each Judicial District can be located at  
https://www.courts.state.wy.us/circuit-courts/circuit-court-locations/.  

TEP 3.  Serve the Garnishee   

Once the garnishment forms have been filed with the Circuit Court Clerk, a file-stamped copy of 
the Writ of Continuing or Non-Continuing Garnishment must be formally served on the Garnishee,  
along with a copy of the Request for Issuance of a Writ of Garnishment, the Answer to Writ of 
Continuing or Non-Continuing Garnishment form, and the Notice of Right to Hearing/Objection 
to Garnishment and Request for Hearing form.  

It is recommended that a Sheriff in the county where the Garnishee is located serve the documents. 
There will be a separate service fee (typically fifty dollars ($50.00) in Wyoming). The Judgment 
Creditor  can  contact  the  Sheriff’s  department  in  the  county  where  the  Garnishee  is  located  to 

Page 3 

  S

 

determine the fee. The Judgment Creditor will need to provide the Sheriff with a file-stamped copy 
of the Writ of Garnishment, along with copies of the other documents listed above, which must be 
served on the Garnishee. 

In addition to the Writ of Continuing or Non-Continuing Garnishment, Request for Issuance of a 
Writ of Garnishment, Answer to Writ of Continuing or Non-Continuing Garnishment, and Notice 
of Right to Hearing/Objection to Garnishment and Request for Hearing, the Sheriff must also be 
provided with  a  copy of the Return of Service to  be  completed upon service of process by the 
Sheriff. The Sheriff will then file the completed Return of Service with the Circuit Court Clerk 
and send the Judgment Creditor a copy.  

STEP 4.  Wait for the Garnishee to Answer or for the Garnishee’s Time to Answer to 
Expire 

In Wyoming, the Garnishee must file a verified Answer with the Circuit Court Clerk. The time in 
which the Garnishee has to answer varies. 

NFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR GARNISHEE:  

o  For a Continuing Garnishment: 

The Garnishee must file a Verified Answer with the Circuit Court Clerk no 
later  than  ten  (10)  days  following  the  date  the  Judgment  Debtor  receives 
earnings  for  the  first  pay  period  affected  by  the  Writ  of  Continuing 
Garnishment, or forty (40) days following the date the Writ was served upon 
you, whichever is earlier. (Before the Garnishee completes the blank answer form, 
the Garnishee should make a copy of the form to use for subsequent answers.) Do 
NOT  sign the Verified Answer until you  are  in front of a Notarial  Officer – the 
Verified Answer MUST BE SIGNED in the presence of a notarial officer. After the 
Verified Answer has been completed, signed and notarized, file your Answer with 
the Circuit Court Clerk, along with a check for the amount garnished, if any, made 
payable to the Circuit Court of the county where the garnishment was filed.  
Any earnings earned by the Judgment Debtor, but not yet paid, and any earnings 
earned within ninety (90) days from the date the Garnishee is served the Writ are 
subject  to  garnishment.  The  Garnishee  must  not  pay  the  Judgment  Debtor  the 
amount set forth in the Verified Answer; instead, the Garnishee must only pay the 
Exempt Earnings amount to the Judgment Debtor at the time he/she is normally 
paid. When the Garnishee files the Verified Answer with the Circuit Court Clerk, 
the Garnishee must also give a copy of the Verified Answer, including a calculation 
of exempt earnings, and the Notice of Right to Hearing/Objection to Garnishment 
and Request for Hearing to the Judgment Debtor.  Finally, the Garnishee must send 
a copy of the Verified Answer to the Judgment Creditor and Judgment Debtor if 
the Garnishee has been provided with a stamped self-addressed envelope. If you 
fail  to  file  a  Verified  Answer  with  the  Circuit  Court  Clerk,  you  may  be 
required to appear in court and pay court costs.

he  Garnishee  must  file  a  Verified  Answer  with  the  Circuit  Court  Clerk 
within ten (10) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, from 
the  date  of  service  of  the  Post  Judgment  Writ  of  Non-Continuing 
Garnishment.  Do  NOT  sign  the  Verified  Answer  until  you  are  in  front  of  a 
Notarial Officer – the Verified Answer MUST BE SIGNED in the presence of a 
notarial  officer.  After  the  Verified  Answer  has  been  completed,  signed  and 
notarized, file your Answer with the Circuit Court Clerk, along with a check for 
the  amount  garnished,  if  any,  made  payable  to  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  county 
where the garnishment was filed.  Any earnings earned by the Judgment Debtor, 
but not yet paid, and any earnings earned within thirty (30) days from the date the 
Garnishee was served the Writ, are subject to garnishment. The Garnishee must 
not pay the Judgment Debtor the amount set forth in the Verified Answer; instead, 
the Garnishee must only pay the Exempt Earnings amount to the Judgment Debtor 
at the time he/she is normally paid. When the Garnishee files the Verified Answer 
with the Circuit Court Clerk, the Garnishee must also give a copy of the Verified 
Answer,  a  calculation  of  exempt  earnings,  and  the  Notice  of  Right  to 
Hearing/Objection  to  Garnishment  and  Request  for  Hearing  to  the  Judgment 
Debtor.  Finally, the Garnishee must send a copy of the Verified Answer  to the 
Judgment Creditor and Judgment Debtor if the Garnishee has been provided with 
a stamped self-addressed envelope.  If you fail to file a Verified Answer with the 
Circuit Court Clerk, you may be required to appear in court and pay court 
costs.  

o  For a Non-Continuing Garnishment: 

  T

If more than one Writ of Continuing or Non-Continuing Garnishment is served on you for 
the same Judgment Debtor, the Writ first served shall take priority.  However, any income 
withholding orders for child support take priority over any other garnishment. 

If you are a Garnishee  and  have questions  regarding  how to  answer the questions 
contained in the Verified Answer, you should seek the advice of an attorney. 

NFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR JUDGMENT CREDITOR AND 
GARNISHEE:  

If the Garnishee fails to file a Verified Answer in the time required, the Judgment Creditor can 
file a Motion for Order to Show Cause asking the Judge to order the Garnishee to give a reason 
for not filing a Verified Answer in the time allotted.  The Judgment Creditor also has the ability 
to request a default against the Garnishee for a failure to file a Verified Answer.  

o  For a Continuing Garnishment 
If the Garnishee files a Verified Answer and does not agree with the calculation of 
Exempt Earnings provided to the Judgment Debtor by the Garnishee, the Judgment 
Debtor may file an objection with the Circuit Court Clerk setting forth the grounds for the 
objection.  A hearing may then be set by the Judge to resolve the objection.   

Page 5 

  I

 

o  For a Non-Continuing Garnishment 
If the Garnishee files a Verified Answer and there is information contained in the 
Verified Answer that the Judgment Creditor or Judgment Debtor does not agree with or 
feels the Garnishee may be liable for, he/she may file and serve upon the Garnishee and 
the other party to the action a reply to the Garnishee’s Answer within ten (10) days after 
the Answer is filed with the Court. The issues will be tried before the Judge and the Judge 
will then enter a judgment.    

TEP 5.  File a Satisfaction of Judgment 

If  the  judgment  is  paid  in  full  through  the  garnishment,  the  Judgment  Creditor  must  file  a 
Satisfaction of Judgment with the Circuit Court Clerk to be recorded in the public records.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
