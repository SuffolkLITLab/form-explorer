OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” or “pro per” litigants.  Although there has 
been  a  recent  surge  of  pro  se  litigation  in  our  courts,  there  are  additional  barriers  that 
people  without  an  attorney  will  inevitably  face,  especially  in  the  area  of  family 
law/domestic relations.  The difficulties increase when there are children, disagreements 
about  property,  financial  interests,  violence,  harassment  or  coercion.  Many  areas  of 
family law are very diverse and complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming 
require certain things that others courts do not.  That is why it is impractical to include all 
legal remedies available to people in family law cases in a single packet.  Therefore, this 
packet  will  be  most  beneficial  for  people involved  in  an  uncontested  case  (i.e.,  you 
both  agree  on  the  issues).  There  are  other  remedies  available,  including  temporary 
orders  on  child  custody,  support,  and  restraining  orders  that  are  not  included  in  this 
packet and may be best pursued with the assistance of an attorney.  The Citizen’s Access 
to Courts Committee is aware of the barriers that exist for low income people in our legal 
system and have created the forms in a manner that they believe will benefit the majority 
of people who represent themselves while also understanding that people with complex 
or emergency circumstances may continue to find themselves better served by getting an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, there are concerns above and 
beyond the normal concerns.  It is recommended that you obtain a lawyer to help you.    There may be 
assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.    Contact  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against 
Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Wyoming Legal Services (1-877-432-9955) or 
the  Wyoming  State  Bar  (1-307-632-9061)  www.wyomingbar.org.    If  you  have  concerns  about 
confidential information such as addresses and/or social security numbers, please consult an attorney and 
do not attempt to do this on your own. You should also know that Protection Orders and Stalking Orders 
are available free of charge at the circuit court clerk’s office.   Please call the Wyoming Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault for assistance in obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking 
orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a protection order involving the Respondent in this 
action,  this  information  should  be  included  in  the  Petition  to  Establish  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child 
Support or the Counterclaim under other actions.     
 

   

   

 

 

 

This  information  packet  is  intended  to  provide  general  information  to  help  you 
complete  the  forms  and  to  take  the  steps  the  law  requires  for  you  to  obtain  an 
Order Establishing Custody, Visitation and Child Support. There is no guarantee 
these forms are still accurate and/or current.  The information in this packet is not 
intended to replace an attorney.   
If  you represent  yourself, YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You must 
decide which forms apply to your situation.   
DO NOT USE each and every form, as some forms say opposite things.   
For  each  form  you  decide  to  use,  make  sure  you  fill  it  out  completely  and 
correctly.  If your forms are not complete, the Judge may reject your packet.

NO  ONE  in  the  Judge’s  office  or  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  can  help 
complete them.  Questions or problems may require the help of an attorney. 

 

 

Where  you  are  requested  to  provide  information,  use  the  blank  spaces  by  either 
typing or printing with blue or black ink.  You must print clearly.  If the judge cannot 
read what you write, the Judge will return the documents.  DO NOT SIGN YOUR 
NAME WHERE THE JUDGE OR CLERK SHOULD SIGN. 

AWS:  IF  YOU  DO  THIS  YOURSELF,  you  must  follow  the  law  as  if  you 
were  a  lawyer.    It  is  your  responsibility  to  properly  prepare  and  file  the  necessary 
documents.    The  Judge  will  not  sign  orders  or  decrees  that  are  incorrect  or 
incomplete, nor will the Judge give you legal advice or make corrections for you. 

ou should read Title 20 of the Wyoming Statutes (the domestic relations laws), 
and  you should  also  read the Wyoming Rules of Civil  Procedure.  Most of the District 
Courts in the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these 
laws and rules can be read.  You may also look up these laws and rules on the internet at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library.”  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this  packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks of Court Cannot Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Employees in the Clerk 
of District Court’s office and in the Judge’s office cannot help you or advise you; if you 
represent yourself, you are on your own.    

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte  communication  is  communication  with  the  Judge  with  only  one  party  present.  
Judges  are  not  allowed  to  engage  in  ex  parte  communication  except  in  very  limited 
circumstances,  so,  absent  specific  authorization  to  the  contrary,  you  should  not  try  to 
speak with or write to the Judge in your case unless the other party is present or has been 
properly notified.  If you have something you need to tell the Judge, you must ask for a 
hearing and give notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and 
send a copy of the written statement to the other party. 

ituations that Need an Attorney.  You should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence.  
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You  do  not  understand  the  Court  process  or  are  having  difficulty  in 

completing the forms. 

ruthfulness.    It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.  
You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury).

Unauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those persons who are doing their own custody case.  It may be an unauthorized practice 
of law for a person who is not a licensed attorney to assist others in a legal action.  Such 
practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou  are  reminded  that,  if  you  choose  to  continue  without  an  attorney,  you 
are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has 
said: “A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any 
other litigant and he must expect and receive…the same treatment as if represented by an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

custody, visitation, and child support, you must file the Petition to Establish Custody, Visitation, 
and Child Support (“Petition”).  If you are filing the Petition, you are the “Petitioner.”  The other 
party will be referred to as the “Respondent.”  

Notarizing  Signatures.    Some  forms  will  require  you  to  have  your  signature  notarized.    Notarial 
Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, or in many cases, Clerks of Court will be 
willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each Clerk’s office has their own policy so check with them 
first before seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.   

here to file. You will file your case in the District Court in the county where either you 
or the Respondent resides. The Petition is given to the Clerk of the District Court, whose office 
is usually located in the county courthouse or a branch of the county courthouse.  A list of the 
Clerks  of  District  Court  for  each  Judicial  District  is  included  in  the  packet.    A  filing  fee  is 
required.    Ask  the  Clerk  what  the  amount  of  the  filing  fee  is  and  what  forms  of  payment  are 
accepted.  

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.”  The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and petition stating the name of 
the Petitioner, the Respondent, the District Court the case is filed in, and the case number. 

Other forms to file with the Petition. 

 

A.  When  you  file  the  Petition,  you  will  also  need  to  file  the  Civil  Cover  Sheet.  

Follow the instructions that accompany that document. 

. 

You will also need to fill out and file a Confidential Statement of the Parties for 
Child Support Order.  This  form provides the Court with  personal  information  (such as social 
security numbers and birth dates) of the parties involved in your case as required by  Wyoming 
law.    This  information  will  be  in  a  confidential  file  so  that  the  general  public  does  not  have 
access to the information.   

You will also need to have the Clerk sign (a/k/a “issue”) the Summons. 

How many copies.   Take  the  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  each  document  to  the 
Clerk’s office.  The Clerk will give you copies of each document back after stamping them with 
the  date  they  were  filed.    This  is  called  a  “file  stamp.”    You  should  keep  one  copy  of  each 
document  for  your  records.    The  other  set  of  documents  will  need  to  be  served  upon  the 
Respondent.

Summary  of  Step  2:    To  start  your  case,  you  will  need  to  file  the  following  documents  with  the  Clerk  of  the 
District Court’s office located in the county courthouse in the county where either you or the Respondent resides: 

A.  Civil Cover Sheet 

a.  Follow the instructions that accompany this form for help completing it correctly. 

B.  Petition to Establish Custody, Visitation, and Child Support  
C.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order; and 
D.   Summons  
E.  Pay the filing fee 
F.  Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.   
a.  The Clerk will give you both copies back after file-stamping them  
b.  You should keep one copy for your records.  
c.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Respondent (Step 3). 

tep 3. 

Serve the Respondent.  Once the Petition and Confidential Statement of 
the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  are  filed,  a  file-stamped  copy  must  be  formally  given  to 
(a/k/a  served  on) the Respondent.   Personal  service of the Petition,  Confidential  Statement  of 
the  Parties  and  Summons  on  the  Respondent  by  a  Sheriff  is  required  unless  the  Respondent 
completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form.  Formal service is required for 
the Petition and the Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order, so the Court 
has proof that the other party actually received the paperwork.  Other forms of service exist, but 
these  are  the  easiest  methods  that  meet  the  formal  service  requirement  for  a  Petition.    If  you 
cannot serve the Respondent by either of these methods, ask the Clerk for additional forms for 
other ways to obtain service. 
 

You  MUST  give  the  Respondent  official  notice  that  you  have  filed  a  Petition  and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order within 90 days from the date you 
filed them.  This is done by serving a copy of the  Summons, the Petition, and the Confidential 
Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  upon  the  Respondent  or  by  having  the 
Respondent sign an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form stating that copies of those 
documents were received.  If you do not serve the Respondent within 90 days, your case can be 
dismissed by the Court. 

How to Serve the Respondent.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to 

serve the Respondent: 

Option 1– Service by Sheriff  
 

. 

  A

 

Summons.  It is recommended to have a sheriff in the county where the Respondent can 
be  found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 
($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).   You can contact the Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the  Respondent  lives  to  determine  the  fee  charged  by  the  Sheriff.    This  is  also  true  if  the 
Respondent is going to be served out of state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff with a file-
stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Petition  and  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child 
Support Order to be served on the Respondent.

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called 
the “Return” (or they may have their own form – an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the  original  with  the  Clerk’s  office  and  send  you  a  copy.    If  you  receive  what  looks  like  the 
original “Return” or “Affidavit of Service” from the Sheriff, call the Clerk’s office to ensure the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the Respondent was given proper notice; 
 

Note:  Once the Respondent has been served, you MUST file the original Summons and 
original Return (or Affidavit of Service) with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows 
that proper service was made. 

ption 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.  If the Respondent agrees, he or she 
may  sign  a  form  stating  that  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Petition  and  Confidential 
Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order were received.  If the Respondent agrees, you 
will need to fill out an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form.  The Respondent must 
sign this document in front of a Notarial Officer.  

Proof of Service.  Once the Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form is signed, 
take  the  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  signed  form  to  the  Clerk’s  office  for  filing.    You 
should keep one copy for your records and provide the other copy to the Respondent. 
 

Note:  You must file the signed Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the 
original Summons with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper service on 
the Respondent was made.  
 

RECAP for Step 3:  You MUST give the Respondent official notice that you have filed a Petition within 90 days 
from the date you filed the Petition.  Choose one of the following methods: 

Option 1 – Service by Sheriff 

A.  Provide copy of the Summons, Petition and Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child 

Support Order to Sheriff where the Respondent lives; 

B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once  the  Respondent  is  served,  be  sure  the  original  Summons  and  the  original  Return  or 

Affidavit of Service are filed with the Clerk’s office; OR 

Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 

A.  Provide a copy of the Summons, Petition and Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child 

Support Order to the Respondent; 

B.  Have the Respondent sign the Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form in front of a 

C.  File the original Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the original Summons 

Notarial Officer;  

with the Clerk’s office.

Step 4.  Wait for the Respondent’s time to respond to expire.  Once 
the Respondent is served, he or she has 20 days (if served in the State of Wyoming or 30 days if 
served out-of-state) to file a Response to the Petition.  You must wait for the appropriate time 
period to expire before you can proceed with the case.  You must wait the 20 days (or 30 days if 
served  out-of-state)  even  if  the  Respondent  tells  you  that  he  or  she  is  not  going  to  file  a 
Response.  

  Computation  of  Time  Limits.  In  computing  most  time  limits,  unless  otherwise 
stated, the day the document is served shall not be included. The last day of the time 
period is included, unless it lands on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, if 
the  Courthouse  is  closed  then  the  time  limit  will  be  on  the  very  next  day  that  the 
Courthouse is open.   If you have questions about time limits you should seek the 
advice of an attorney. 
 

•  While waiting, move on to Step 5.  You can also use this time to continue to work on 

the other required forms to be sure they are filled out completely and correctly. 
 

RECAP  for  Step  4:    You  MUST  wait  for  the  Respondent’s  time  to  file  a  Response  to  expire  before  you  can 
proceed with your case.  In the meantime:

Mark on the calendar when the time to file a Response expires; 
Move on to Step 5 while waiting; and 
Use this time to ensure the required forms are filled out completely and correctly. 

tep  5.              Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Respondent’s Response is required to 
be  served  on  the  Petitioner  (use  the  table  in  5.A.  below  to  determine  date),  which  includes  a 
summary of the facts believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child 
custody is at issue.    

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

A.  WHEN TO PROVIDE:  Initial Disclosures must be provided to the Respondent 
(or his/her attorney) WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE RESPONDENT’S RESPONSE IS 
REQUIRED TO BE SERVED ON YOU (use table below).  Be sure to keep a copy of 
your  Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the 
date  when  you  and  the  Respondent  are  required  to  provide  initial  disclosures  to  one 
another.

Option A. The following instructions apply if the Respondent filed a 
Response,  or Response  and Counterclaim, and you both agree on all 
of the issues of your case.  If you and the Respondent agree on the issues involved in 
your case, then you will need to complete the following: 
 

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit including the 
required  attachments  with  the  Court.    If  the  Respondent  does  NOT  file  a 
Confidential  Financial  Affidavit,  you  will  need  to  complete  an  Affidavit  of 
Imputed  Income  to  show  the  Court  how  much  money  the  Respondent  makes.  
This is an additional form contained in your packet. 
 

•  Required  Attachments.    The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  of  the  parties 
must be supported with documentation of both current and past earnings. Proper 
documentation  of  current  earnings  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  pay  stubs, 
employer  statements,  or  receipts  and  expenses  if  self-employed.  Documentation 
of  current  earnings  shall  be  supplemented  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  tax 
return to provide verification of earnings over a longer period. Include copies of 
income tax returns for the previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to 
show how much you have made so far this year.  
 
Fill  out  an  Affidavit  for  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation  and  Child 
Support Without Appearance of Parties.  This form provides the admissible evidence the Court 
needs to enter an Order without requiring the parties to attend a hearing.  

B. 

. 

Fill out an Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support (“Order”).  
This form will need to be filled out completely, signed by both you and the Respondent and both 
of  your  signatures  notarized.    In  addition  to  signing  the  Order,  you  should  also  initial  each 
page of the Order to verify that each page contains the terms you agreed upon. 

ere are some important laws and helpful hints in completing the Order:

•  Custody  and  Visitation.    You  and  the  Respondent  need  to  determine  which 
custody and visitation plan will apply in your circumstances.  It is unusual for the 
Court  not  to  award  any  visitation  or  supervised  visitation  to  the  non-custodial 
parent.  
 

o 

 If  there  is  a  concern  that  your  child(ren)  may  be  harmed  by  the  other 
parent  physically  and/or  emotionally,  you  should  seek  advice  from 
someone  familiar  with  parenting  and  child  development  issues.    There 
may  be  an  organization  in  your  community  that  can  help  facilitate 
visitation between the children and you or the other parent.   You can also

contact  the  facilitators  of  any  parenting  classes  in  your  community  for 
other ideas.   

•  Factors  to  be  considered  for  awarding  custody  and  visitation.    The  Order 
contains  several  options  for  custody  and  visitation  arrangements.    Ideally,  both 
parents  will  work  together  to  select  the  proper  custody  and  visitation  plan 
depending upon the family circumstances.   In awarding custody and setting forth 
a  visitation  plan,  Wyoming  law  requires  that  the  Court  consider  the  following 
factors: 

The geographic location of each parent; 
Each  parent's  willingness  and  ability  to  perform  the  child  care 
duties  associated  with  the  child(ren),  relative  to  the  child(ren)'s 
stage of development such as feeding, changing, bathing, preparing 
the  child(ren)  for  school,  taking  responsibility  for  the  child(ren)'s 
homework, etc.; 
Each parent's ability to care for the child(ren)'s needs (consider not 
only historical involvement but a parent's willingness and ability to 
learn the necessary skills, as well); 
The lack of hostility between the parents; 
The  ability  of  both  parents'  work  schedules  and  the  child(ren)'s 
schedule to accommodate extended access; 
The child(ren)'s age(s) and strength of attachment to each parent; 
The child(ren)'s relationship with his/her friends. 
 

•  Child(ren)’s  interests  should  control.    The  use  of  a  calendar  for  scheduling 
purposes  is  highly  recommended.    The  parents'  work  schedules  and  the 
child(ren)'s  school  and  extracurricular  activities  need  to  be  considered  when 
developing a visitation plan.  This is especially true for those parents who do not 
enjoy  a  traditional  work  week.    While  visitation  should  be  an  enjoyable  and 
enriching experience, it is an obligation and responsibility for each parent as well 
as a right and a privilege.  Both parents must also have a good faith commitment 
to developing and carrying out a visitation plan.  You need to focus on what type 
of schedule would be in the child(ren)’s best interest.    

•  Parenting  classes.  At  any  time  the  Court  may  require  parents  to  attend 
appropriate  parenting  classes,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  parenting  classes  to 
lessen  the  effects  of  custody  battles  on  children.    Both  parents  are  generally 
required  to  attend  classes  when  they  are  ordered.    If  the  class  is  ordered,  you 
MUST file a Certificate of Completion with the Clerk’s office.  This certificate is 
provided by the class instructor. 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Respondent completed (or by the Affidavit of Imputed Income if the Respondent 
did not complete his/her own Confidential Financial Affidavit).  You may use the

Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to  help  you  calculate  the  support 
due  or  contact  your  local  child  support  enforcement  agency  for  assistance.    
Another option is to go online to:

➢  You  CANNOT  agree  that  no  support  will  be  paid.    Wyoming  law 
allows for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical 
custody, each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the year, and both parents contribute substantially to 
the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   

  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include the specific reasons for deviation in the Order.  

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  TITLE  19,  KID  CARE,  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the net income of you and the Respondent even if you 
and the Respondent agree to a lower amount of support. 

  ➢

 

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support,  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to pay for 

 

 

  E

Page 9 of 15 
 

expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for 
which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Petitioner  and  50%  to 
Respondent). 

 

D. 

Fill  out  an  Order  for  Income  Withholding.   The  Court  is  required  by  statute  to 

enter an Order for Income Withholding in every case where child support has been ordered.   

E. 

 
Fill out an Income Withholding for Support.  This form is required if you need to 
have  the  child  support  paid  directly  from  a  non-custodial  parent’s  employer.    If  you  need 
assistance  in  filling  out  this  form,  or  if  you  need  assistance  in  collecting  child  support,  you 
should contact the child support enforcement agency in your district.  The Clerk can provide you 
with the agency’s contact information. 

Other Forms:  Other forms may be required depending on the county where your 

case is filed.  Ask the Clerk if additional forms are required. 

. 

Copies and Envelopes.  Take an original and two (2) copies of each of the above 
documents for filing with the Clerk and two (2) addressed, stamped envelopes (one addressed to 
you and one to  the  Respondent with  enough postage to  cover the cost  of  mailing the  Order to 
you and the Respondent).   A copy of any documents that you file (other than the Order) must be 
sent  to  the  Respondent  on  the  date  that  you  filled  out  on  the  Certificate  of  Service  on  each 
document.   
 

➢  If  a  hearing  is  not  required  by  your  Court,  the  Clerk  will  mail  a  copy  of  your 

Order if accepted by the Court.  
 

➢   If a hearing is required by your Court, follow the next steps: 

. 

Hearing.    In  some  Courts,  a  hearing  is  required  before  the  Judge  will  sign  the 
Order.    If  this  is  the  case,  you  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  the  Request  for 
Setting.    If  you  have  reached  an  agreement,  check  the  box  that  states  that  the  parties  have 
reached  an  agreement.    Indicate  how  much  time  you  will  need  for  the  hearing  (usually  15 
minutes  if  there  is  an  agreement).    You  will  file  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  with  the  Clerk’s 
office  and  the  Court  will  fill  in  the  hearing  date  and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the 
Respondent.  You  will  need  to  provide  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the 
Respondent  to  the  Clerk.    These  documents  are  additional  forms  that  are  contained  in  your 
packet. 

. 

Evidence.  At the hearing, you will need to inform the Judge about your situation 
and what you are asking him or her to do.  You will also need to give the proposed Order to the 
Judge.  The Judge may ask you questions.  The Judge will not guide you through the hearing, tell 
you how to proceed or advise you on the law.  Following the hearing, the Judge may advise you 
whether or not changes need to be made to the proposed Order by you or the other party or the 
Judge may make his or her own revisions to the Order.

Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  Indicate how much time 
you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your  evidence  and  write  that  in 
(usually  one (1) to three (3) hours).   You also need to decide whether or not  you want a court 
reporter  to  record  the  proceeding.  SEE  BELOW  FOR  DETAILS  ON  GETTING  A  COURT 
REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a transcript of the hearing 
will not be available.   It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not get a court 
reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Trial  and  Requesting 
Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date

and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the  other  party.    You  will  need  to  provide  an 
addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the  Respondent  to  the  Clerk.    Both  the 
Request for Setting and the Order Setting Trial and Requiring Pretrial Statements are 
additional forms contained in your packet. 

D. 

Pretrial  Disclosures.    Both  parties  must  provide  to  the  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.  
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Respondent (or his/her attorney). 

 

 

E. 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must  present  the  Court  with  the  completed  and  signed  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation, 
and  Child  Support  before  the  Court  will  take  the  trial  off  of  the  schedule.  There  will  be  no 
continuances or canceling of the trial date based on telephone calls.  If you need a continuance, 
you should contact an attorney for assistance in seeking one.  

.       Court Reporter.  If you wish to have a court reporter, you shall provide notice to 
the appropriate official court reporter  as  soon as  possible, but  no later than  three (3)  working 
days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the court reporter by phone 
or  by  submitting  a  written  request.    Please  note  that  if  providing  notice  through  the  mail,  the 
request  must  be  received  by  the  court  reporter  no  later  than  three  working  days  prior  to  the 
hearing.    The  clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day 
notice requirement will not be waived by the Court.  The notice is required for all civil matters 
including jury trials.  

. 

 Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered (signed 
by the Judge), you must follow the terms and provide the Court with the information requested in 
that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a list of your 
proposed witnesses and what their testimony is going to be about within the time frame ordered 
(usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you or assist you at 
trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 
 

H. 

Final  Decision  (Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child  Support).  
Following  the  trial,  the  Judge  will  make  a  decision  or  may  take  the  matter  under  advisement, 
meaning  he  or  she  will  need  to  think  further  before  making  a  determination.    If  the  Judge 
instructs  you,  you  must  take  that  decision  and  type  it  into  the  Order  Establishing  Custody, 
Visitation, and Child Support incorporating the Judge’s decision.

the law.

Child Support has been file-stamped before you can be sure your order is final.  The time limit to

of pleadings or other papers as required by law.  This form, approved by the Wyoming Supreme Court, is required 
for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet. Consequently, a civil cover sheet 
is  submitted  to  the  Clerk  of  Court  for  each  civil  case  filed.    The  attorney  or  pro  se  litigant  filing  a  case  should 
complete the form as follows:

an official within a governmental agency, identify first the agency and then the official, giving both name and title. 

I. 
Nature  of  Suit.    Place  an  “X”  in  the  appropriate  box.    ONE  AND  ONLY  ONE  BOX  SHOULD  BE 
CHECKED.  If the nature of suit cannot be determined, because the cause of action fits more than one nature of suit,

OTHER PARTY’S INCOME TO THIS DOCUMENT. 

If  you  have  information  about  the  other  parent’s  previous  or  current  employment  by  area  and 
occupation, you may be able to get information regarding wages by visiting the U.S. Department

 ______ weekly   
 ______ every two weeks  
 ______ twice per month (i.e. 1st and 15th of every month) 
 ______ monthly 
_______annually 

Convert annual, bi- weekly, bi-monthly, and weekly amounts to monthly amounts below. 
**  Gross  income  (includes  tips,  commission  and  bonuses).    Monthly  amounts  are  calculated  by 
multiplying weekly amount by 52 and dividing by 12; multiplying bi-weekly amounts by 26 and dividing 
by 12; and multiplying semi-monthly amounts by 24 and dividing by 12; annually by dividing by 12.  If 
only the “gross income” is known, multiply that number by .25 (or other number if instructed by Court) and 
then  subtract  that  amount  from  the  gross  to  arrive  at  the  net  monthly  income.  If  the  other  party  has  a 
history of only working for minimum wage or less, and is capable, to your knowledge of working 40 
hours/week, the court may impute his/her income at $1,141.25 net monthly for a noncustodial parent 
and $1,185.67 net monthly for a custodial parent.  You may call your local child support enforcement 
office  for  more  information  on  imputing  a  custodial  or  non-custodial  parent’s  wage.  Federal  minimum 
wage is $7.25/hour as of July 1, 2012.

Income" means any form of payment or return in money or in kind to an individual, regardless of source. 
Income  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  wages,  earnings,  salary,  commission,  compensation  as  an 
independent  contractor,  temporary  total  disability,  permanent  partial  disability  and  permanent  total 
disability  worker's  compensation  payments,  unemployment  compensation,  disability,  annuity  and 
retirement benefits, and any other payments made by any payor, but shall not include any earnings derived 
from  overtime  work  unless  the  court,  after  considering  all  overtime  earnings  derived  in  the  preceding 
twenty-four (24) month period, determines the overtime  earnings can reasonably be expected to continue 
on  a  consistent  basis.  In  determining  income,  all  reasonable  unreimbursed  legitimate  business  expenses 
shall be deducted. Means tested sources of income such as Pell grants, aid under the personal opportunities 
with employment responsibilities (POWER) program, food stamps and supplemental security income (SSI) 
shall  not  be  considered  as  income.  Gross  income  also  means  potential  income  of  parents  who  are 
voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. 
  
"Net  income"  means  income  as  defined  in  the  box  above,  less  personal  income  taxes,  social  security 
deductions, cost of dependent health care coverage for all dependent children, actual payments being made 
under  preexisting  support  orders  for  current  support  of  other  children,  other  court-ordered  support 
obligations  currently  being  paid  and  mandatory  pension  deductions.  Payments  towards  child  support 
arrearage shall not be deducted to arrive at net income.

other formulas apply.  If “split” (meaning each parent has physical custody of at least one (1) child), the 
amount  shall  be  allocated  to  each  parent  based  upon  the  number  of  those  children  in  the  physical 
custody of that parent (see Table C on page 3). If “shared” (meaning  each parent has actual overnight 
custody  of  the  children  for  a  certain  percentage  of  time),  the  amount  will  be  allocated  based  on  the 
percentage of time (Table B below).   
 

B.    SHARED  PHYSICAL  CUSTODY:    Wyo.  Stat.  §  20-2-304  (c)  provides  for  special  support 
computation of support when each parent keeps the children overnight for more than twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the expenses of the children 
in  addition  to  the  payment  of  child  support.  If this is the custodial arrangement, support may be

the _____ day of ___________________, 20_____ commencing at ___:_______ o’clock ___.m.   

(____) minutes/hour(s)/day(s) has been set aside for the trial of this matter.  

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each party shall file and serve on the opposing party or 

their attorney, if represented, no later than five (5) days prior to the trial, the party’s sworn statement 

setting forth the facts, to the best of the party’s knowledge and belief, called for by Section “A” of 

the attached list of information, and a statement by counsel (attorney), if any, of the client’s position 

and proof as called for by Section “B.”  These filings are required to narrow and simplify the issues, 

prevent surprise and to eliminate unnecessary proof.  The material may be presented in narrative 

form but must be complete for purposes called for by this order.  To avoid duplication, the parties or 

their attorneys, if any, may submit a joint statement of those items not in dispute. 

 

Any party requesting the reporting of a particular matter by the official court reporter 

shall provide notice to the official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) 

working days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the court reporter

by phone or by submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the 

mail, the request must be received by the court reporter no later than three working days prior 

to the hearing.  The clerk will be able to inform you which court reporter to contact.  The 

three-day notice requirement will not be waived by the Court.  The notice is required for all 

civil matters including jury trials.  If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a 

transcript of the hearing will not be available.  It is very difficult to appeal a decision if you do 

not have a transcript of everything that is said at the trial.  Rule 904 Uniform Rules of the 

District Courts of the State of Wyoming. 

In the event that this case settles, the parties are informed that there will be no change in the 

scheduling of this matter by the Court until such time as the settlement is reduced to writing and a 

written agreement is presented to the court.  There will be no continuances or canceling of the trial 

date based on telephone calls.

ONCE  FILED,  THE  PARTIES  MAY  MAKE  SUBSTANTIAL,  PERMANENT 
MODIFICATIONS  TO  THIS  VISITATION  PLAN  ONLY  BY  WRITTEN  AGREEMENT 
SIGNED  BY  BOTH  PARTIES,  APPROVED  BY  THE  JUDGE  AND  FILED  WITH  THE 
COURT.    MINOR,  NON-PERMANENT  CHANGES  MAY  BE  MADE  ANY  TIME  IF  BOTH 
PARTIES AGREE TO THE CHANGES. 

The child support amount may depend on the custodial arrangement that is ordered by the court.  If each parent 
keeps the children overnight for more than  twenty-five percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute 
substantially to the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support, a “shared responsibility 
child support” obligation shall be determined by use of the tables.  Also, when each parent has physical custody 
of at least one (1) of the children, a “shared responsibility child support” obligation for all of the children shall 
be determined by use of the tables.  See Wyo. Stat. §20-2-304(c) and (d).  For assistance in calculating child 
support, go to the following website:

pursuant  to  Wyo.  Stat.  §20-2-201  through  §20-2-204  and  §20-2-311(d).  
Wyoming  law  states  that  any  payment  of  child  support  not  paid  when  due  shall 
automatically  become  a  judgment  against  the  parent  who  is  supposed  to  pay  on 
the due date.  This judgment is subject to a 10% late payment penalty if it is not 
paid within thirty-two (32) days. Wyoming Statute §1-16-103(b) also states that if 
child  support  becomes  delinquent  in  an  amount  equal  to  or  greater  than  one 
month’s  obligation,  a  notice  may  issue  to  employers  and  others  who  may  owe 
money to the obligated parent; a percentage of the non-custodial parent’s income 
(35% minimum and up to 65% in some cases) of the obligated parent’s wages and 
other  income  could  be  withheld  and  submitted  to  the  Clerk  of  this  Court  to  be 
applied toward child support obligations.

coverage, including any change relating to the information required above. 
 

9.C.  Failure To Provide Insurance. The Court may hold an obligated parent in 
contempt  for  refusing  to  provide  the  ordered  insurance  or  for  failing  or 
refusing to provide the information required above.  In addition, if either 
parent fails to provide insurance or proof of insurance as required by this 
agreement, the other parent may provide such insurance and the obligated 
parent shall be liable to the other parent for the cost of such insurance plus 
the costs incurred in collection, including reasonable attorney’s fees. 

9.D.  Costs  Not  Paid  For  By  Insurance.  The  parents  are  jointly  liable  to 
providers  for  all  health  care  expenses  (including,  but  not  limited  to, 
medical,  dental,  orthodontic,  optical,  prescription  drugs,  counseling,  and 
all  other  health  care  expenses)  of  the  child(ren).    All  deductibles,  co-
payments and other expenses for health care that are not paid for by health 
insurance shall be paid by the parents as follows:

% by Petitioner and  
  

 

% by Respondent. 

 
If the insuring parent fails to pay the insurance premium, all health 
care expenses of the children not covered by insurance shall be the 
responsibility of that party.   
 
If  the  insuring  parent  fails  to  maintain  insurance  as  required,  that 
party may be found in contempt of Court and  may be required to 
pay  or  reimburse  the  expenses  and  costs  set  forth  in  Wyo.  Stat. 
§20-2-401(e).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYERS/INCOME WITHHOLDERS 
 
State-specific contact and withholding information can be found on the Federal Employer Services website located at: 
http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/newhire/employer/contacts/contact_map.htm  

riority:  Withholding for support has priority over any other legal process under State law against the same income 

(USC 42 §666(b)(7)).  If a Federal tax levy is in effect, please notify the sender.  

ombining Payments: When remitting payments to an SDU or Tribal CSE agency, you may combine withheld amounts 

from more than one employee/obligor’s income in a single payment.  You must, however, separately identify each 
employee/obligor’s portion of the payment. 

Payments To SDU: You must send child support payments payable by income withholding to the appropriate SDU or to a 
Tribal CSE agency. If this IWO instructs you to send a payment to an entity other than an SDU (e.g., payable to the 
custodial party, court, or attorney), you must check the box above and return this notice to the sender.  Exception: If this 
IWO was sent by a Court, Attorney, or Private Individual/Entity and the initial order was entered before January 1, 1994 or 
the order was issued by a Tribal CSE agency, you must follow the “Remit payment to” instructions on this form.  

eporting the Pay Date: You must report the pay date when sending the payment. The pay date is the date on which the 

amount was withheld from the employee/obligor’s wages.  You must comply with the law of the State (or Tribal law if 
applicable) of the employee/obligor’s principal place of employment regarding time periods within which you must 
implement the withholding and forward the support payments. 

Multiple IWOs: If there is more than one IWO against this employee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IWOs 
due to Federal, State, or Tribal withholding limits, you must honor all IWOs to the greatest extent possible, giving priority 
to current support before payment of any past-due support.  Follow the State or Tribal law/procedure of the 
employee/obligor’s principal place of employment to determine the appropriate allocation method. 

ump Sum Payments: You may be required to notify a State or Tribal CSE agency of upcoming lump sum payments to 

this employee/obligor such as bonuses, commissions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to determine if you are 
required to report and/or withhold lump sum payments. 

iability: If you have any doubts about the validity of this IWO, contact the sender.  If you fail to withhold income from the 
employee/obligor’s income as the IWO directs, you are liable for both the accumulated amount you should have withheld 
and any penalties set by State or Tribal law/procedure. _____________________________________________________  
 _________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 _________________________________________________________________________________________________  

nti-discrimination: You are subject to a fine determined under State or Tribal law for discharging an employee/obligor 

from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against an employee/obligor because of this IWO.

OMB Expiration Date – 05/31/2014.  The OMB Expiration Date has no bearing on the termination date of the IWO; it identifies the

Withholding Limits: You may not withhold more than the lesser of:  1) the amounts allowed by the Federal Consumer 
Credit Protection Act (CCPA) (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)); or 2) the amounts allowed by the State or Tribe of the 
employee/obligor’s principal place of employment (see REMITTANCE INFORMATION).  Disposable income is the net 
income left after making mandatory deductions such as: State, Federal, local taxes; Social Security taxes; statutory 
pension contributions; and Medicare taxes.  The Federal limit is 50% of the disposable income if the obligor is supporting 
another family and 60% of the disposable income if the obligor is not supporting another family. However, those limits 
increase 5% - to 55% and 65% - if the arrears are greater than 12 weeks.  If permitted by the State or Tribe, you may 
deduct a fee for administrative costs.  The combined support amount and fee may not exceed the limit indicated in this 
section. 

 

  

or Tribal orders, you may not withhold more than the amounts allowed under the law of the issuing Tribe.  For Tribal 

employers/income withholders who receive a State IWO, you may not withhold more than the lesser of the limit set by the 
law of the jurisdiction in which the employer/income withholder is located or the maximum amount permitted under section 
303(d) of the CCPA (15 U.S.C. 1673 (b)). 

epending upon applicable State or Tribal law, you may need to also consider the amounts paid for health care premiums 

in determining disposable income and applying appropriate withholding limits.     

rrears greater than 12 weeks? If the Order Information does not indicate that the arrears are greater than 12 weeks, 

then the Employer should calculate the CCPA limit using the lower percentage.
