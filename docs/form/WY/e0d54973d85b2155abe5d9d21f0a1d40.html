      <pre>FAMILY LAW INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ONFIDENTIALITY:   If  you have concerns about keeping information confidential, such as 
your address and/or social security number, please consult an attorney.  You should also know 
that Domestic Violence Protection Orders or Stalking Orders are available free of charge at the 
circuit  court  clerks’  offices.    You  may  request  assistance  in  obtaining  Domestic  Violence 
Protection  or  Stalking  Orders  from  your  local  domestic  violence  or  sexual  assault  program  or 
you may call the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault  (844) 264-
8080 (toll free) or (307) 755-0992.  There are also private attorneys who may be willing to assist 
clients in these matters.   If  you have ever obtained a Protection Order against the other party, 
this information should be indicated in the Complaint for Divorce or the Counterclaim.    

ead  through  the  following  information  and  instructions  before  completing  the  forms  to 
make sure you qualify to file a divorce in Wyoming. To file  a complaint, either 1) you or 
your spouse must live in Wyoming for at least sixty (60) days immediately before you file, 
or 2) you must have been married in Wyoming and you or your spouse must have lived in 
Wyoming ever since.  You must fill out all forms as completely as possible.  If your forms 
are not complete, the Judge may reject your packet.   

tep 1.  Getting  Started.    The  following  forms  are  required  in  all  uncontested 
divorce  cases.    It  is  recommended  that  you  complete  all  of  these  forms  before  you  file  the 
Complaint for Divorce so that they will be ready to be filed at the appropriate time: 
 

1.  Civil Cover Sheet 
2.  Vital Statistics form 
3.  Complaint for Divorce (with Children) 
4.  Summons  
5.  Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 
6.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order 
7.  Confidential Financial Affidavit 
8.  Affidavit for Divorce Without Appearance of Parties 
9.  Decree of Divorce (with Children) 
10. Order for Income Withholding  
11. Income  Withholding  for  Support  (or,  you  can  open  a  case  with  your  local  child 

support enforcement agency) 
 

*Other forms may be required depending on the Court and on your situation.  If additional forms 
are needed, they will be discussed below where applicable.   

tep 2. 

File  your  divorce  case.    A  divorce  case  begins  with  the  filing  of  a 
Complaint for Divorce.  A Complaint for Divorce is a written request to the court for a divorce.  
The  person  who  originally  asks  for  this  legal  action  is  called  the  Plaintiff  and  remains  the 
Plaintiff throughout the case.

Notarizing  Signatures.    You  will  need  to  sign  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  and  have  it  notarized.  
Notarial Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, or in many cases, Clerks of Court 
will be willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each Clerk’s office has their own policy so check with 
them first before seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.   

Where to file. You will file your case in the District Court in the county where either you 
or your spouse resides. The Complaint for Divorce is given to the Clerk of the District Court, 
whose office is usually located in the county courthouse or a branch of the county courthouse.  A 
list of the Clerks of District Court for each Judicial District is included in the packet.  A filing fee 
is required.  Ask the Clerk what the amount of the filing fee is and what forms of payment are 
accepted.  

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.”  The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and complaint stating the name of 
the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the District Court the case is filed in and the case number. 

Other forms to file with the Complaint. 

A.  When  you  file  the  Complaint  for  Divorce,  you  will  also  need  to  file  the  Civil 

Cover Sheet.  Follow the instructions that accompany this form. 

. 

You  will  also  need  to  file  the  Vital  Statistics  form.    Fill  out  all  portions  of  this 
form EXCEPT the “Decree” section, which will be completed by the Clerk when your divorce is 
final.   

. 

You will also need to fill out and file a Confidential Statement of the Parties for 
Child Support Order.  This  form  provides the Court with  personal  information  (such as social 
security numbers and birth dates) of the parties involved in your case as required by statute, but 
permits  the  information  to  be  located  in  a  confidential  file  so  that  the  general  public  does  not 
have access to the information.   

You will also need to have the Clerk sign (a/k/a “issue”) the Summons. 

How many copies. Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s 
office.  The Clerk will give copies of each document back to you after stamping them with the 
date they were filed.  This is called a “file stamp.”  You should keep one copy of each document 
for your records.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Defendant.

Summary of Step 2:  To start your divorce case, you will need to file the following documents with the  Clerk of 
the District Court’s office located in the county courthouse in the county where either you or your spouse resides: 

A.  Civil Cover Sheet 

B.  Vital Statistics Form   

a.    Follow the instructions that accompany this form for help completing it correctly;  

a.  Fill out all portions, EXCEPT the “Decree” section, which will be completed by the  Clerk 

when your divorce is final; 
C.  Complaint for Divorce (with Children);  
D.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order; and 
E.   Summons;  
F.  Pay the filing fee; 
G.  Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.   
a.  The Clerk will give both copies back to you after file-stamping them.  
b.  You should keep one copy for your records.  
c.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Defendant (Step 3). 

tep 3. 

Serve the Defendant.  The person against whom the original legal action 
is being requested is called the Defendant and remains the Defendant throughout the case.  The 
Defendant is expected to file an answer to the Complaint for Divorce.  
 

Once your case has been filed with the Clerk, a file-stamped copy of the paperwork must 
be formally given to (a/k/a served on) the Defendant.  The Defendant needs to be served with the 
Complaint for Divorce, the Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order, and 
the  Summons  so  the  Court  has  proof  that  he  or  she  received  the  papers.   A  Sheriff  must 
personally serve  the Complaint  for Divorce, Confidential  Statement  of the Parties for Child 
Support  Order,  and  the  Summons  on  the  Defendant,  unless  the  Defendant  completes  an 
Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form.   Other  forms  of  service  exist,  but  these 
are the two easiest methods that meet the formal service requirement for a  Complaint for 
Divorce.  If you cannot serve the Defendant by either of these methods, ask the Clerk for 
additional forms for alternative methods of service.  These forms are also available in Pro 
Se Packet 10.   
 

You MUST give the Defendant official notice that you have filed for divorce within 90 
days from the date you filed the Complaint for Divorce and Confidential Statement of the Parties 
for  Child  Support  Order.    This  is  done  by  serving  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  the 
Complaint  for  Divorce,  and  the  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order 
upon  the  Defendant  or  by  having  the  Defendant  sign  an  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of 
Service  form  stating  that  copies  of  those  documents  were  received.    If  you  do  not  serve  the 
Defendant within 90 days, your case can be dismissed by the Court. 

How to Serve the Defendant.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to

Summons.  It is recommended to have a Sheriff in the county where the Defendant can 
be  found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 

Family Law Information and Instructions (With Children) 
Revised September 2019

($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).   You can contact the Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the Defendant lives to determine the fee charged by the Sheriff.  This is also true if your spouse 
is going to be served out of state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff in the county where your 
spouse  resides  with  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Complaint  for  Divorce,  and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order to be served on the Defendant. 
 

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called 
the “Return” (or they may have their own form – an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the  original  with  the  Clerk’s  office  and  send  you  a  copy.    If  you  receive  what  looks  like  the 
original “Return” or “Affidavit of Service” from the Sheriff, call the Clerk’s office to ensure the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the Defendant was given proper notice. 
 

Note:   Once the  Defendant  has been served,  you MUST  file the original  Summons and 
the Return (or Affidavit of Service) with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that 
proper service was made. 
 

ption 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.  If the Defendant agrees, he or she 
may sign a form  stating  that a  file-stamped copy of the  Summons, Complaint for  Divorce, and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order were received.  If the Defendant 
agrees,  you  will  need  to  fill  out  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form.    The 
Defendant must sign this document in front of a notarial officer.  

Proof of Service.  Once the Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form is signed, 
the original and two (2) copies of the signed form must go to the Clerk’s office for filing.  You 
should keep one copy for your records and provide the other copy to the Defendant. 
 

Note:    You  must  file  the  signed  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  AND  the 
Summons with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper service was made 
on the Defendant.    

Summary of Step 3:  You MUST give the Defendant official notice that you have filed for divorce within 90 days 
from the date you filed the Complaint for Divorce.  Choose one of the following methods: 
Option 1 – Service by Sheriff 

A.  Provide a file-stamped copy of the  Summons, Complaint for Divorce,  and Confidential Statement of the 

Parties for Child Support Order to the Sheriff where the Defendant lives; 

B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once the Defendant is served, be sure the original Summons and the original Return or Affidavit of Service 

are filed with the Clerk’s office; OR 

Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 

A.  Provide a file-stamped copy of the  Summons, Complaint for Divorce,  and Confidential Statement of the 

Parties for Child Support Order to the Defendant; 

B.  Have  the  Defendant  sign  the  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  in  front  of  a  notarial 

officer;  

C.  File the original Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form with the Clerk’s office; and 
D.  File the original Summons with the Clerk’s office

  Computation  of  Time  Limits.  -  In  computing  most  time  limits,  unless  otherwise 
stated, the day the document is served shall not be included. The last day of the time 
period is included, unless it lands on a Saturday, a Sunday,  or a legal holiday, or, if 
the  Court  is  closed,  then  the  time  limit  will  be  on  the  very  next  day  that  the 
Courthouse is open.   If you have questions about time limits you should seek the 
advice of an attorney. 
 

•  While waiting, move on to Step 5.  You can also use this time to continue to work on 

the other required forms to be sure they are filled out completely and correctly. 

  •

Step 4.  Wait for  the  Defendant’s  time  to  Answer  to  expire.    Once 
the Defendant is served, he or she has 20 days (if served in the State of Wyoming) or 30 days (if 
served  out-of-state)  to  file  an  Answer  to  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    You  must  wait  for  the 
appropriate time period to expire before you can proceed with the divorce case.  You must wait 
the 20 days (or 30 days if served out-of-state) even if the Defendant tells you that he or she is not 
going to file an Answer.  

Summary  of  Step  4:    You  MUST  wait  for  the  Defendant’s  time  to  file  an  Answer  to  expire  before  you  can 
proceed with your divorce case.  In the meantime: 

A. 
B. 
C. 

Mark on the calendar when the Defendant’s time to Answer expires; 
Move on to Step 5 while waiting; and 
Use this time to ensure the required forms are filled out completely and correctly. 

tep  5.              Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Defendant’s Answer is required to be 
served on the Plaintiff (use the table in 5.A. below to determine date).  The information consists 
of  a  schedule  of  financial  assets;  schedule  of  non-financial  assets;  schedule  of  all  debts  owed 
individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information; 
information  regarding  other  income  and  retirement  accounts;  and  a  summary  of  the  facts 
believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child custody is at issue.  
Both  parties  are  required  to  provide  this  information  in  order  to  fully  disclose  finances  of  the 
parties relating to the calculation of child support.   

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

A.  WHEN TO  PROVIDE:    Initial Disclosures must  be provided to  the Defendant 
(or  his/her  attorney)  WITHIN  30  DAYS  AFTER  THE  DEFENDANT’S  ANSWER  IS 
REQUIRED TO BE SERVED ON YOU (use table below).  Be sure to keep a copy of 
your  Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the 
date  when  you  and  the  Defendant  are  required  to  provide  initial  disclosures  to  one 
another.

Option A. The following instructions apply if  the  Defendant  filed an 
Answer  or  Answer  and  Counterclaim,  and  you  both  agree  on  all  of 
the issues of your divorce.  If you and the Defendant agree on the issues involved in 
your divorce, then you will need to complete the following: 
 

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

A. 
 

B. 

C. 

 

 

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit including the 
required  attachments  with  the  Court.    If  the  Defendant  does  NOT  file  a 
Confidential  Financial  Affidavit,  you  will  need  to  complete  an  Affidavit  of 
Imputed Income to show the Court how much money the Defendant makes.  This 
is an additional form contained in your packet. 
 

•  Required  Attachments.    The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  of  the  parties 
must be supported with documentation of both current and past earnings. Proper 
documentation  of  current  earnings  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  pay  stubs, 
employer  statements,  or  receipts  and  expenses  if  self-employed.  Documentation 
of  current  earnings  shall  be  supplemented  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  tax 
return to provide verification of earnings over a longer period. Include copies of 
income tax returns for the previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to 
show how much you have made so far this year. Be sure to also include copies of 
your health insurance cards, if applicable.  

Fill  out  an  Affidavit  for  Divorce  Without  Appearance  of  Parties.    This  form 
provides  the  admissible  evidence  the  Court  needs  to  enter  a  Decree  without 
requiring the parties to attend a hearing. 
 
Fill out a Decree of Divorce (with Children).  This form will need to be filled out 
completely,  signed  by  both  you  and  the  Defendant  and  both  of  your  signatures 
must  be  notarized.  In  addition  to  signing  the  Decree,  you  should  also  initial 
each  page  of  the  Decree  to  verify  that  each  page  contains  the  terms  you 
agreed upon. Here are some important laws and helpful hints in completing the 
Decree of Divorce: 

•  Custody  and  Visitation.    You  and  the  Defendant  need  to  determine  which 
custody and visitation plan will apply in your circumstances.  It is unusual for the 
Court  not  to  award  any  visitation  or  supervised  visitation  to  the  non-custodial 
parent.  
 

o 

 If  there  is  a  concern  that  your  child(ren)  may  be  harmed  by  the  other 
parent  physically  and/or  emotionally,  you  should  seek  advice  from 
someone  familiar  with  parenting  and  child  development  issues.    There 
may  be  an  organization  in  your  community  that  can  help  facilitate 
visitation between the children and you or the other parent.   You can also 

Family Law Information and Instructions (With Children) 
Revised September 2019 
Page 7 of 15 
 

 

 

contact  the  facilitators  of  any  parenting  classes  in  your  community  for 
other ideas.   

•  Factors to be considered for awarding custody and visitation.  The Decree of 
Divorce contains several options for custody and visitation arrangements.  Ideally, 
both  parents  will  work  together  to  select  the  proper  custody  and  visitation  plan 
depending upon the family circumstances.   In awarding custody and setting forth 
a  visitation  plan,  Wyoming  law  requires  that  the  Court  consider  the  following 
factors: 

 
The geographic location of each parent; 
Each  parent's  willingness  and  ability  to  perform  the  child  care 
duties  associated  with  the  child(ren),  relative  to  the  child(ren)'s 
stage of development such as feeding, changing, bathing, preparing 
the  child(ren)  for  school,  taking  responsibility  for  the  child(ren)'s 
homework, etc.; 
Each parent's ability to care for the child(ren)'s needs (consider not 
only historical involvement but a parent's willingness and ability to 
learn the necessary skills, as well); 
The lack of hostility between the parents; 
The  ability  of  both  parents'  work  schedules  and  the  child(ren)'s 
schedule to accommodate extended access; 
The child(ren)'s age(s) and strength of attachment to each parent; 
The child(ren)'s relationship with his/her friends. 
 

•  Child(ren)’s  interests  should  control.    The  use  of  a  calendar  for  scheduling 
purposes  is  highly  recommended.    The  parents'  work  schedules  and  the 
child(ren)'s  school  and  extracurricular  activities  need  to  be  considered  when 
developing a visitation plan.  This is especially true for those parents who do not 
enjoy  a  traditional  work  week.    While  visitation  should  be  an  enjoyable  and 
enriching experience, it is an obligation and responsibility for each parent as well 
as a right and a privilege.  Both parents must also have a good faith commitment 
to developing and carrying out a visitation plan.  You need to focus on what type 
of schedule would be in the child(ren)’s best interest.    

•  Parenting  classes.  At  any  time,  the  Court  may  require  parents  to  attend 
appropriate  parenting  classes,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  parenting  classes  to 
lessen the effects of divorce on children.   Both  parents are generally required to 
attend  classes  when  they  are  ordered.    If  the  class  is  ordered,  you  MUST  file  a 
Certificate of Completion with the Clerk’s office.  This certificate is provided by 
the class instructor. 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Defendant completed (or by the Affidavit of Imputed Income if the Defendant did 
not  complete  his/her  own  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit).    You  may  use  the

Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to  help  you  calculate  the  support 
due  or  contact  your  local  child  support  enforcement  agency  for  assistance.    
Another option is to go online to: 
https://childsupport.wyoming.gov/calculator/index.html 
to calculate child support. 

➢  You  CANNOT  agree  that  no  support  will  be  paid.    Wyoming  law 
allows for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical 
custody, each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the year, and both parents contribute substantially to 
the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   
 

➢  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include the specific reasons for deviation in the Decree of Divorce.  

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  TITLE  19,  KID  CARE,  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the net income of you and the Defendant even if you 
and the Defendant agree to a lower amount of support. 

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable  cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to  pay for 
expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for

which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Plaintiff  and  50%  to 
Defendant). 

 

D. 

Fill  out  an  Order  for  Income  Withholding.   The  Court  is  required  by  statute  to 

enter an Order for Income Withholding in every case where child support has been ordered.   

E. 

 
Fill out an Income Withholding for Support.  This form is required if you need to 
have  the  child  support  paid  directly  from  a  non-custodial  parent’s  employer.    If  you  need 
assistance  in  filling  out  this  form,  or  if  you  need  assistance  in  collecting  child  support,  you 
should contact the child support enforcement agency in your district.  The Clerk can provide you 
with the agency’s contact information. 

.    Other Forms:  Other forms may be required depending on the county where your 
case is filed.  Ask the Clerk if additional forms are required before your Decree of Divorce will 
be entered.  

. 

Copies and Envelopes.  Take an original and two (2) copies of each of the above 
documents for filing with the Clerk and two (2) addressed, stamped envelopes (one addressed to 
you  and  one  to  the  Defendant  with  enough  postage  to  cover  the  cost  of  mailing  the  Decree  of 
Divorce  to  you  and  the  Defendant).      A  copy  of  any  documents  that  you  file  (other  than  the 
Decree  of  Divorce)  must  be  sent  to  the  Defendant  on  the  date  that  you  filled  out  on  the 
Certificate of Service on each document.   
 

➢  If  a  hearing  is  not  required  by  your  Court,  the  Clerk  will  mail  a  copy  of  your 

Decree of Divorce if accepted by the Court.  
 

➢   If a hearing is required by your Court, follow the next steps: 

. 

Hearing.    In  some  Courts,  a  hearing  is  required  before  the  Judge  will  sign  the 
Decree  of  Divorce.    If  this  is  the  case,  you  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  the 
Request for Setting.  If you have reached an agreement, check the box that states that the parties 
have reached an agreement.  Indicate how much time you will need for the hearing (usually 15 
minutes  if  there  is  an  agreement).    You  will  file  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  with  the  Clerk’s 
office,  and  the  Court  will  fill  in  the  hearing  date  and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the 
Defendant.  You will need to provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Defendant 
to the Clerk.  These documents are additional forms that are contained in your packet. 

. 

Evidence.    At  the  hearing,  you  will  need  to  tell  the  Judge  that  either  1)  you  or 
your  spouse  have  lived  in  Wyoming  for  at  least  60  days  immediately  before  you  filed  the 
Complaint for Divorce, or 2) you and your spouse were married in Wyoming and at least one of 
you has lived in Wyoming ever since.  You will also need to tell the Judge about irreconcilable 
differences in the marriage (why you want a divorce), and why the settlement you reached (who 
gets what) is fair.

Following the hearing, the Judge will make any necessary changes to the Decree of Divorce and 
will sign it. 

. 

When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk.  This process may take time if 
the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk  that  the 
Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is final. 

ummary  of  Option  A:    If  you  and  the  Defendant  agree  on  all  issues  in  the  divorce  and  the  Defendant  filed  an

enough  postage  to  cover  the  cost  of  mailing  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  to  you  and  the 
Defendant);   
▪  Attend the Hearing. 

Your divorce is final when the Decree of Divorce has been signed by the Judge and filed by the Clerk. 

ption B. If  the  Defendant  does  not  file  an  Answer  or  Answer  and 

Counterclaim, obtain a default divorce by following these steps: 
 

A. 

 Default Divorce.  After the required waiting period has expired, you may obtain 
what is referred to as a divorce by default if the Defendant does NOT file an Answer or Answer 
and Counterclaim to the Complaint for Divorce. 

. 

Necessary  forms.    Fill  out  and  sign  the  Application  for  Entry  of  Default  and 
Affidavit in Support of Default.  Take an original and two (2) copies of these documents to the

there is a hearing.  Ask the Clerk if this is required for your Court.  If it is, fill out a Request for 
Setting and request 15 minutes for the hearing.  You will file the Order Setting Hearing with 
the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date and time and mail a copy to  you 
and the Defendant.  You will need to provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the 
Defendant to the Clerk. 

E. 

Evidence.    At  the  hearing,  you  will  need  to  tell  the  Judge  that  either  1)  you  or

F.  When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk.  This may take time if the Judge 
requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk  that  the  Decree  of 
Divorce has  been file-stamped before  you can be sure  your divorce is  final.   The time limit  to 
appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed with the Clerk’s office.

9.  Complete and file any additional documents required by your Court. 
10.  If your Court requires a hearing before entering a Decree of Divorce, then you will also need to file 

and do the following: 

•  Request for Setting  
•  Order Setting Hearing  
•  Take an original and two (2) copies of the Order Setting Hearing for filing with the Clerk

Your divorce is final when the Decree of Divorce has been signed by the Judge and filed by the Clerk. 

ption C.  If the Defendant Answers or Answers and Counterclaims, 
and  you  and  the  Defendant  do  NOT  agree  on  all  issues  of  your 
divorce, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

You  must  file  a  Reply  to  the  Counterclaim.    If  the  Defendant  has  filed  an 
Answer  and  Counterclaim  for  a  divorce,  you  will  have  a  time  limit  (usually  20  days)  to  file  a 
written response (Reply to Counterclaim) to the counterclaim.  The original, signed copy of your 
reply must be filed with the Clerk and a copy must be sent to the Defendant (or his/her attorney).   

•  Caution:  If you do not file the original Reply to Counterclaim with the Clerk 
within the time allowed, the Defendant can seek a default divorce against you 
and may get what he/she asked for in his/her counterclaim. 

B. 
Judge at a trial.   

Trial.  If there is no agreement, your case will have to be heard and decided by a 

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

C. 

Request  a  trial  date.    You  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  a 
Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  Indicate how much time 
you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your  evidence  and  write  that  in 
(usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether or not you want a  Court 
reporter  to  record  the  proceeding.    SEE  BELOW  FOR  DETAILS  ON  GETTING  A  COURT 
REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a transcript of the hearing 
will not be available.   It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not get a Court 
reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   

 

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and 
Requesting Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the

    O

hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the other party.  You will need to 
provide  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the  Defendant  to  the  Clerk.  
Both  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and  Requiring 
Pretrial Statements are additional forms contained in your packet. 

D. 

Pretrial  Disclosures.    Both  parties  must  provide  to  the  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.  
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Defendant (or his/her attorney). 

E. 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must present the Court with the completed and signed Decree of Divorce before the Court will 
take  the  trial  off  of  the  schedule.  There  will  be  no  continuances  or  canceling  of  the  trial  date 
based  on  telephone  calls.    If  you  need  a  continuance,  you  should  contact  an  attorney  for 
assistance in seeking one.  

.       Court reporter.  If you wish to have a court reporter you shall provide notice to 
the official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days before 
the  matter  is  set  for  hearing.    You  can  provide  notice  to  the  court  reporter  by  phone  or  by 
submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the mail, the request 
must be received by the court reporter no later than three working days prior to the hearing.  The 
Clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day  notice 
requirement  will  not  be  waived  by  the  Court.    The  notice  is  required  for  all  civil  matters 
including jury trials.  
 

G. 

 Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Divorce Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered 
(signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the  information 
requested in that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a 
list  of  your  proposed  witnesses  and  what  their  testimony  is  going  to  be  about  within  the  time 
frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you 
or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 
 

H. 

Final Decision (Decree of Divorce).  Following the trial, the Judge will make a 
decision or may take the matter under advisement, meaning he or she will need to think further 
before making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type 
it into the Decree of Divorce incorporating the Judge’s decision. 

 

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Judge will not

guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed, or advise you on 
the law. 
 

➢  You MUST also file the documents outlined in Step 6, Option A, items A and 

C through G above. 

I.      When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk of Court.  This process may take 
time  if  the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk’s 
office that the Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is 
final.  The time limit to appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed 
with the Clerk’s office.  

Summary of Option C:  If the Defendant filed an Answer or Answer and Counterclaim and you do NOT agree on 
the issues, complete the following: 

emember:  Take an original and two copies of each document to file with the Clerk’s office.  You will need to send

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
