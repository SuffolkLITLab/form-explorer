OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” or “pro per” litigants.  Although there has 
been  a  recent  surge  of  pro  se  litigation  in  our  courts,  there  are  additional  barriers  that 
people  without  an  attorney  will  inevitably  face,  especially  in  the  area  of  family 
law/domestic relations.  The difficulties increase when there are children, disagreements 
about  property,  financial  interests,  violence,  harassment  or  coercion.  Many  areas  of 
family law are very diverse and complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming 
require certain things that others courts do not.  That is why it is impractical to include all 
legal remedies available to people in family law cases in a single packet.  Therefore, this 
packet  will  be  most  beneficial  for  people involved  in  an  uncontested  case  (i.e.,  you 
both  agree  on  the  issues).  There  are  other  remedies  available,  including  temporary 
orders  on  child  custody,  support,  and  restraining  orders  that  are  not  included  in  this 
packet and may be best pursued with the assistance of an attorney.  The Citizen’s Access 
to Courts Committee is aware of the barriers that exist for low income people in our legal 
system and have created the forms in a manner that they believe will benefit the majority 
of people who represent themselves while also understanding that people with complex 
or emergency circumstances may continue to find themselves better served by getting an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, there are concerns above and 
beyond the normal concerns.  It is recommended that you obtain a lawyer to help you.    There may be 
assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.    Contact  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against 
Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Wyoming Legal Services (1-877-432-9955) or 
the  Wyoming  State  Bar  (1-307-632-9061)  www.wyomingbar.org.    If  you  have  concerns  about 
confidential information such as addresses and/or social security numbers, please consult an attorney and 
do not attempt to do this on your own. You should also know that Protection Orders and Stalking Orders 
are available free of charge at the circuit court clerk’s office.   Please call the Wyoming Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault for assistance in obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking 
orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a protection order involving the Respondent in this 
action,  this  information  should  be  included  in  the  Petition  to  Establish  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child 
Support or the Counterclaim under other actions.     
 

   

   

 

 

 

This  information  packet  is  intended  to  provide  general  information  to  help  you 
complete  the  forms  and  to  take  the  steps  the  law  requires  for  you  to  obtain  an 
Order Establishing Custody, Visitation and Child Support. There is no guarantee 
these forms are still accurate and/or current.  The information in this packet is not 
intended to replace an attorney.   
If  you represent  yourself, YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You must 
decide which forms apply to your situation.   
DO NOT USE each and every form, as some forms say opposite things.   
For  each  form  you  decide  to  use,  make  sure  you  fill  it  out  completely  and 
correctly.  If your forms are not complete, the Judge may reject your packet.

NO  ONE  in  the  Judge’s  office  or  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  can  help 
complete them.  Questions or problems may require the help of an attorney. 

 

 

Where  you  are  requested  to  provide  information,  use  the  blank  spaces  by  either 
typing or printing with blue or black ink.  You must print clearly.  If the Judge cannot 
read what you write, the Judge will return the documents.  DO NOT SIGN YOUR 
NAME WHERE THE JUDGE OR CLERK SHOULD SIGN. 

AWS:    IF  YOU  DO  THIS  YOURSELF,  you  must  follow  the  law  as  if  you 
were  a  lawyer.    It  is  your  responsibility  to  properly  prepare  and  file  the  necessary 
documents.    The  Judge  will  not  sign  orders  or  decrees  that  are  incorrect  or 
incomplete, nor will the Judge give you legal advice or make corrections for you. 

ou should read Title 20 of the Wyoming Statutes (the domestic relations laws), 
and  you should  also  read the Wyoming Rules of Civil  Procedure.  Most of the District 
Courts in the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these 
laws and rules can be read.  You may also look up these laws and rules on the internet at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library”.  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks of Court Cannot Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Employees in the Clerk 
of District Court’s office and in the Judge’s office cannot help you or advise you; if you 
represent yourself, you are on your own.    

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte  communication  is  communication  with  the  Judge  with  only  one  party  present.  
Judges  are  not  allowed  to  engage  in  ex  parte  communication  except  in  very  limited 
circumstances,  so,  absent  specific  authorization  to  the  contrary,  you  should  not  try  to 
speak with or write to the Judge in your case unless the other party is present or has been 
properly notified.  If you have something you need to tell the Judge, you must ask for a 
hearing and give notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and 
send a copy of the written statement to the other party. 

ituations that Need an Attorney.  You should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence.  
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You  do  not  understand  the  Court  process  or  are  having  difficulty  in 

completing the forms. 

ruthfulness.    It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.  
You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury).

Unauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those persons who are doing their own custody case.  It may be an unauthorized practice 
of law for a person who is not a licensed attorney to assist others in a legal action.  Such 
practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou  are  reminded  that,  if  you  choose  to  continue  without  an  attorney,  you 
are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has 
said: “A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any 
other litigant and he must expect and receive…the same treatment as if represented by an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

that in your Response.  If you disagree with something and you fail to “deny” it in your 
Response, the Judge can find that you admitted it. 
 
ii. 
Time  limit  to  respond.    You  have  only  a  limited  amount  of  time  to  file  a 
Response  to  the Petition.   Generally, if  you were served within the State of Wyoming, 
you will have 20 days to file the Response to the Petition.  If you do not file a Response 
to the Petition by  your deadline, then the other party may obtain an Order Establishing 
Custody, Visitation, and Child Support giving him/her everything he/she requested in the 
Petition. 

iii. 
Computation of Time Limits.  In computing most time limits, unless otherwise 
stated, the day the pleading is served shall not be included. The last day of the period so 
computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, when 
the  act  to  be  done  is  the  filing  of  a  paper,  a  day  on  which  weather  or  other  conditions 
have made the office of the clerk of the court inaccessible, in which event the period runs 
until  the  end  of  the  next  day  which  is  not  one  of  the  aforementioned  days.  When  the 
period  of  time  prescribed  or  allowed  is  less  than  11  days,  intermediate  Saturdays, 
Sundays,  and  legal  holidays  shall  be  excluded  in  the  computation.  A  "legal  holiday" 
includes any day officially recognized as a legal holiday in this state by designation of the 
legislature or appointment as a holiday by the governor.  

iv. 
REQUIRED  INFORMATION  FOR  CHILDREN:  Certain  information  is 
required  to  be  given  under  oath  for  each  child,  unless  you  have  a  court  order  or  are 
operating  under  another  law  allowing  you  to  maintain  confidentiality  of  addresses  or 
other identifying information.  If the information is not provided, the court, upon motion 
of a party or its own motion, may stop the case from going forward until the information 
is provided. The information necessary is included in the Response and the Response and 
Counterclaim. 

. 
Notarizing Signatures.  You will need to sign the Response to the Petition and 
have it notarized.  Notarial Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, 
or in many cases, clerks of court will be willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each 
clerk’s office has their own policy so check with them first before seeking notarization of 
your signature on the forms.   

i. 
Certificate  of  Service:    Copies  of  all  documents  sent  to  or  filed  with  the  court 
must be sent to the Petitioner before the Judge will consider them.  This is certificate is 
included at the end of each document that requires it.   

ii.  Copies.  Make two (2) copies of the document.  The original will be filed by the 
Clerk of District Court, one copy is for the Petitioner and the other copy is for you (the

Respondent).    You  will  need  to  repeat  this  step  for  all  documents  you  file  with  the 
Clerk’s office;   
 

OPTION B.  Response and Counterclaim.  If you want the Judge to grant relief to you 
(for example, give you custody and order the other party to pay child support, etc.) you should 
file a Response and Counterclaim.  A Response and Counterclaim responds to the Petition and 
gives you an opportunity to tell the court what you want to happen with the case.  First, you will 
go  through  each  and  every  paragraph  of  the  Petition  and  either  “admit”  or  “deny”  each 
paragraph.  Second, the Counterclaim portion of the document asks the Judge to give you what 
you  want.    You  must  fill  out  all  of  the  information  in  the  Response  and  Counterclaim 
completely. 
 

i.   

Follow Step 1(ii) through Step 1(vii) above. 

OTE:  If you have any questions or concerns as to when the deadline to file the Response 

and Counterclaim is, you should consult an attorney. 
 

ii. 

Petitioner’s  Reply  to  Your  Counterclaim.    The  Petitioner  must  reply  to  the 
Counterclaim.  If you file a Counterclaim, the Petitioner will have 20 days to “reply” by filing a 
Reply to Counterclaim.  The Petitioner will either admit or deny the separate allegations in your 
Counterclaim.    If  the  Petitioner  fails  to  reply  to  the  Counterclaim,  you  may  be  entitled  to  file 
Default paperwork seeking the relief you request in your Counterclaim.  

STEP 2.  Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Respondent’s Response is required to 
be  served  on  the  Petitioner  (use  the  table  in  2.A.  below  to  determine  date),  which  information 
includes a summary of the facts believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody 
where child custody is at issue.  

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

A.  WHEN  TO  PROVIDE:    Initial  Disclosures  must  be  provided  to  the  Petitioner 
(or his/her attorney) WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER YOUR RESPONSE IS REQUIRED TO 
BE  SERVED  ON  THE  PETITIONER  (use  table  below).    Be  sure  to  keep  a  copy  of 
your  Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the 
date  when  you  and  the  Petitioner  are  required  to  provide  initial  disclosures  to  one 
another.     
 

1.  Begin with the date you were served with the Petition: ___________________

__________________________ 
OR 

b.  If  you  signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service,  add  20 

days to the date in #1:  ___________________________ 

OR 
If you were served out-of-state, add 30 days to the date in #1:  
 __________________________ 
 

3.  Add 30 days to the date in #2(a), (b), or (c):  ___________________________ 

The  date  set  forth  in  #3  is  the  date  by  which  you  and  the  Petitioner  must  provide  your 
completed Initial Disclosures forms to one another. 
 
DO NOT FILE THE INITIAL DISCLOSURES WITH THE COURT.  This

STEP 3.  Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit.  

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit with the court 

with all the necessary supporting documentation.   
 

•  Required Attachments.  The Confidential Financial Affidavit must be supported 
with  documentation  of  both  current  and  past  earnings.  Proper  documentation  of 
current earnings includes, but is not limited to pay stubs, employer statements, or 
receipts and  expenses if self-employed. Documentation  of current  earnings shall 
be supplemented with copies of the most recent tax return to provide verification 
of  earnings  over  a  longer  period.  Include  copies  of  income  tax  returns  for  the 
previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to show how much you have 
made so far this year.  

•  The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit  may  be  filed  with  the  Clerk’s  office  at  the 

same time you file your Response or Response and Counterclaim.   
 
STEP 4. 
If you and the Petitioner agree on all of the terms for custody, visitation and child 
support, then the Order  will need to be filled out completely, signed by  you and the  Petitioner 
and both of your signatures need to be notarized.  In addition to signing the Order, you should 
also initial each page of the  Order  to verify that each page contains the terms you agreed 
upon.

•  Custody  and  Visitation.    You  and  the  Petitioner  need  to  determine  which 
custody and visitation plan will apply in your circumstances.  It is unusual for the 
Court  not  to  award  any  visitation  or  supervised  visitation  for  the  non-custodial 
parent.  
 

o 

 If  there  is  a  concern  that  your  child(ren)  may  be  harmed  by  the  other 
parent  physically  and/or  emotionally,  you  should  seek  advice  from 
someone  familiar  with  parenting  and  child  development  issues.    There 
may  be  an  organization  in  your  community  that  can  help  facilitate 
visitation between the children and you or the other parent.   You can also 
contact  the  facilitators  of  any  parenting  classes  in  your  community  for 
ideas or additional resources.   

•  Factors  to  be  considered  for  awarding  custody  and  visitation.    The  Order 
contains  several  options  for  custody  and  visitation  arrangements.    Ideally,  both 
parents  will  work  together  to  select  the  proper  custody  and  visitation  plan 
depending upon the family circumstances.   In awarding custody and setting forth 
a  visitation  plan,  Wyoming  law  requires  that  the  Court  consider  the  following 
factors: 

 

 
The geographic location of each parent; 
Each  parent's  willingness  and  ability  to  perform  the  child  care 
duties  associated  with  the  child(ren),  relative  to  the  child(ren)'s 
stage of development such as feeding, changing, bathing, preparing 
the  child(ren)  for  school,  taking  responsibility  for  the  child(ren)'s 
homework, etc.; 
Each parent's ability to care for the child(ren)'s needs (consider not 
only historical involvement but a parent's willingness and ability to 
learn the necessary skills, as well); 
The lack of hostility between the parents; 
The  ability  of  both  parents'  work  schedules  and  the  child(ren)'s 
schedule to accommodate extended access; 
The child(ren)'s age(s) and strength of attachment to each parent; 
The child(ren)'s relationship with his/her friends. 
 

•  Child(ren)’s  interests  should  control.    The  use  of  a  calendar  for  scheduling 
purposes  is  highly  recommended.    The  parents'  work  schedules  and  the 
child(ren)'s  school  and  extracurricular  activities  need  to  be  considered  when 
developing a visitation plan.  This is especially true for those parents who do not 
enjoy  a  traditional  work  week.    While  visitation  should  be  an  enjoyable  and 
enriching experience, it is an obligation and responsibility for each parent as well 
as a right and a privilege.  Both parents must also have a good faith commitment 
to developing and carrying out a visitation plan.  You need to focus on what type 
of schedule would be in the child(ren)’s best interest.

•  Parenting  classes.  At  any  time,  the  Court  may  require  parents  to  attend 
appropriate  parenting  classes,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  parenting  classes  to 
lessen  the  effects  of  custody  battles  on  children.  Both  parents  are  generally 
required  to  attend  classes  when  they  are  ordered.    If  the  class  is  ordered,  you 
MUST file a Certificate of Completion with the Clerk’s office.  This certificate is 
provided by the class instructor. 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Petitioner completed.  You may use the Child Support Computation Form as a 
guide to help you calculate the support due.  Another option is to go online to: 

https://childsupport.wyoming.gov/calculator/index.html 

o calculate child support. 

  t

➢  You CANNOT agree that no support will be paid.  The statutes allow 
for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical custody 
and each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than  twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the 
expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   
 

➢  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include  the  specific  reasons  for  deviation  in  the  Order  Establishing 
Custody, Visitation, and Child Support.    

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  MEDICAID  (TITLE  19),  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the  net  income of  you and the Petitioner even if  you 
and the Petitioner agree to a lower amount of support.

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support,  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to  pay for 
expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for 
which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Petitioner  and  50%  to 
Respondent). 

• 

When will your order become final? Your order will not be final until the Judge 
signs the Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support and it is filed with the Clerk 
of Court.  This process may take time if the Judge requires changes to the proposed Order.  You 
must verify with the Clerk’s office that the Order has been file-stamped before you can be sure 
your Order is final.  The time limit to appeal an Order begins to run from the day the Order is 
filed with the Clerk’s office.   

TEP 5.  If  you  and  the  Petitioner  do  NOT  agree  on  all  issues  of 

your case, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

Trial.  If you and the Petitioner cannot agree on all issues, your case will have to 

be heard and decided by a Judge at a trial.   

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

B. 

Request a trial date.  If the Petitioner has NOT done so, you will need to request 
a hearing by completing a Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  
Indicate  how  much  time  you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your 
evidence and write that in (usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether 
or not  you want  a  court  reporter to  record the proceeding.    SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS  ON 
GETTING A COURT REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a 
transcript of the hearing will not be available.  It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if 
you do not get a court reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   
 

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Trial  and  Requesting 
Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date 
and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the  other  party.    You  will  need  to  provide  an 
addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Petitioner to the Clerk.

Once a trial date has been set, do the following: 
 

C. 

Pretrial  Disclosures.  -    Both  parties  must  provide  to  the  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.   
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Petitioner (or his/her attorney). 

 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must present the Court with the completed and signed Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, 
and Child Support in writing before the Court will take the trial off of the schedule. There will 
be  no  continuances  or  canceling  of  the  trial  date  based  on  telephone  calls.    If  you  need  a 
continuance, you should contact an attorney for assistance in seeking one.  

 

• 

Court Reporter.  If you wish to have a court reporter, you shall provide notice to 
the appropriate official court reporter  as  soon as  possible, but  no later than  three (3) working 
days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the court reporter by phone 
or  by  submitting  a  written  request.    Please  note  that  if  providing  notice  through  the  mail,  the 
request  must  be  received  by  the  court  reporter  no  later  than  three  working  days  prior  to  the 
hearing.    The  clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day 
notice requirement will not be waived by the Court.  The notice is required for all civil matters 
including jury trials.  

 

Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered (signed 
by the Judge), you must follow the terms and provide the Court with the information requested in 
that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a list of your 
proposed witnesses and what their testimony is going to be about within the time frame ordered 
(usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you or assist you at 
trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 

• 

Final  Decision  (Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Support).  
Following  the  trial,  the  Judge  will  make  a  decision  or  may  take  the  matter  under  advisement, 
meaning  he  or  she  will  need  to  think  further  before  making  a  determination.    If  the  Judge 
instructs  you,  you  must  take  that  decision  and  type  it  into  the  Order  Establishing  Custody, 
Visitation, and Child Support incorporating the Judge’s decision. 

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Judge will not 
guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on 
the law.
