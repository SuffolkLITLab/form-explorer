Instructions for Obtaining an Order to Show Cause  
 
Use this Packet if you are trying to enforce a prior Court order because the other party is 
not  following  the  order  (i.e.,  you  want  to  have  the  other  party  held  in  contempt).    Please 
read  through  the  following  information  and  instructions  before  completing  the  forms  to 
ensure that you qualify to seek an Order to Show Cause from the Court.  

tep 1.  Getting  Started.    If  the  other  party  has  willfully  failed  to  follow  a  prior 
Court order, then you may be able to have them held in contempt by the Court.  To do so, the 
following forms are required: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

Motion for Order to Show Cause (attach a copy of your prior court order) 
Affidavit in Support of Order to Show Cause  
Order to Show Cause  
 

Be sure to complete each form completely and accurately.  You will need to attach a copy of the 
prior  court  order  that  you  are  seeking  to  enforce.    A  copy  can  be  obtained  from  the  Clerk  of 
District Court for a small fee. 

tep 2. 

File  the  Documents.    You  will  file  your  documents  with  the  Clerk  of 
District  Court  where  the  order  you  are  trying  to  enforce  was  filed.    There  is  not  a  cost  to  file 
these papers, but there is a cost to have the other party served with the documents.  
 

Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.  The Clerk 
will give you copies of each document back after stamping them with the date they were filed.  
You should keep one copy of each document for your records.  The other set of documents will 
need to be served upon the other party.  A judge will need to sign the Order to Show Cause, and 
the Court will set a date for a hearing on your motion. 

 
RECAP for Step 2:  To have the other party held in contempt for failing to follow a prior order 
issued by the Court, you will need to file the following documents with the Clerk of the District 
Court’s office: 

A.  Motion for Order to Show Cause; and 
B.  Affidavit in Support of Order to Show Cause  
C.  Order to Show Cause  
D.  Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.   

a.  The Clerk will give you both copies back after file-stamping them  
b.  You should keep one copy for your records.  
c.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the other party. 
d.  The Judge will sign the Order to Show Cause and set a date for a hearing.

Serve the Other Party.  Wyoming law requires that  you give notice to 

Step 3. 
the other party about the filing of the motion. This is known as “service of process.”  
 

Service by Sheriff.  To  serve  the  documents  on  the  other  party,  you  must  take  the 
documents to the Sheriff’s Department in the county in which the other party lives. Service fees 
vary  in  Wyoming  counties,  but  typically  cost  around  $50.00.  Check  with  the  Sheriff’s 
Department to determine how much the service fee is in your county.  If the other party is to be 
served  outside  of  Wyoming,  you  must  contact  the  Sheriff’s  office  in  the  county  where  the 
respondent is to be served to determine the service fee and address for forwarding the documents 
you wish to have served on the Defendant or Respondent.  

roof of Service.  The Sheriff’s Department will complete the last page of the Order to 
Show  Cause  called  the  “Return  of  Service  by  Sheriff”  (or  they  may  have  their  own  form  -  an 
“Affidavit of  Service”) and will usually file the  original with  the  Clerk’s office and send  you a 
copy.  If you receive what looks like the original Order to Show Cause with the Return portion 
completed  or  an  “Affidavit  of  Service”  from  the  Sheriff,  call  the  Clerk’s  office  to  ensure  the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the other party was given proper notice. 

A.  Provide copy of the Motion for Order to Show Cause; Affidavit in Support of 
Order to Show Cause, and Order to Show Cause to Sheriff where the other 
party lives; 

B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once  the  other  party  is  served,  be  sure  the  original  Return  or  Affidavit  of 

Service is filed with the Clerk’s office. 

ote:    Once  the  other  party  has  been  served,  you  MUST  be  sure  the  original  Order  to 
Show Cause with the completed Return (or Affidavit of Service) is on file with the Clerk’s 
office so that the Judge knows that proper service was made.   
 

RECAP  for  Step  3:    You  MUST  give  the  other  party  official  notice  that  you  have  filed  a 
motion to hold them in contempt.  Notice is given by having the other party served by doing the 
following: 

   

Service by Sheriff 

 
tep 4.  Attend Hearing.  If the other party was served and proof of service is on 
file with the Clerk’s office, attend the scheduled hearing.  Be on time and dressed appropriately 
(as if you were going to a job interview).  Present your case to the Judge.  The Judge will decide 
if the other party has willfully failed to follow the prior court order and advise you of his or her 
decision. 
 

Note:  If you were unable to serve the other party in time for the hearing, follow Step 5 

below. 

 

RECAP for Step  4:    If  the other party  was served, attend the hearing.   If the other party was 
NOT served, move on to Step 5.

The Judge will make a decision and advise you of his or her ruling.

Step 5.  Dismissal.    If  you  decide  not  to  pursue  the  contempt  action  (because  you 
cannot find the other party to serve him or her, or if the other party has cured the reason for the 
contempt  action,  or  for  any  other  reason),  you  must  file  the  Order  of  Dismissal.    If  the  other 
party has not been served with the Order to Show Cause, only your signature is required on the 
Order of  Dismissal.   If,  however, the  other party has  been served with  a  copy  of the  Order to 
Show Cause, both parties need to sign the Order of Dismissal. 
 

RECAP for Step 5:  If you no longer need to pursue the contempt action or if the other party 
was NOT served in time for the hearing, complete the following: 

A.  Order of Dismissal 

signed by you. 

Dismissal.    

a.  If the other party was not served, the Order of Dismissal only needs to be 

b.  If the other party was served, then he or she must also sign the Order of 

B.  Take an original and two (2) copies of the Order of Dismissal for filing with the 
Clerk  and  two  (2)  addressed,  stamped  envelopes  (one  addressed  to  you  and  one  to  the 
other party  with enough postage to cover the cost of mailing the  Order of Dismissal to 
you and the other party).  The Clerk will mail the order to you once it has been signed by 
the Judge.
