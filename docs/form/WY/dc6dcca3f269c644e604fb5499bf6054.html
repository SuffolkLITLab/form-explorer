      <pre>OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” litigants.  This packet is often referred to as 
the “pro se divorce packet.”  These packets work best when parties are able to agree and 
become  more  difficult  when  there  are  children,  disagreements  about  property,  financial 
interests,  violence,  harassment  or  coercion.  Many  areas  of  family  law  are  very  
complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming require certain things that others 
courts  do  not.    Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  include  all  legal  solutions  available  to 
people in a divorce action in a single packet.  Again, this packet will be most useful for 
people involved in an uncontested divorce (i.e., you both agree on all matters).  There 
are other types of actions available, including temporary orders on child custody, support, 
alimony and restraining orders that are not included in this packet and might be easier to 
obtain with an attorney.  These forms have been created to  benefit the majority of people 
who  represent  themselves  while  also  understanding  that  people  with  complex  or 
emergency  circumstances  may  continue  to  find  themselves  better  served  by  getting  an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, it is recommended that you find 
an  attorney  to  help  you.      There  may  be  assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.  
Contact the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Legal 
Aid of Wyoming ( 1-877-432-9955) or the Wyoming State Bar (1-307-632-9061) www.wyomingbar.org.  
If  you  have  concerns  about  confidential  information  such  as  addresses  and/or  social  security  numbers, 
please  consult  an  attorney  and  do  not  attempt  to  do  this  on  your  own.  You  should  also  know  that 
Protection  Orders  and  Stalking  Orders  are  available  free  of  charge  at  the  circuit  court  clerk’s  office.   
Please  call  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against  Domestic  Violence  &  Sexual  Assault  for  assistance  in 
obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a 
protection order involving your spouse, you should include this information in the Complaint for Divorce 
or Counterclaim under the “Other Proceedings” section.

LAWS:    All  laws  and rules  that  apply  to  attorneys  apply  to  you.    It  is  your 
responsibility to properly prepare and file the necessary documents.  The Judge will not 
sign orders that are incorrect or incomplete, nor will the Judge give you legal advice 
or make corrections for you. 

ou  should  read  Title  20  of  the  Wyoming  Statutes  (the  divorce  laws),  and  you 
should also read the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.  Most of the District Courts in 
the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these laws and 
rules  can  be  read.    You  may  also  look  up  these  laws  and  rules  on  the  internet  at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library”.  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks May Not Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Unless your county has a court 
facilitator,  employees  in  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  and  in  the  Judge’s  office 
cannot help you or give you legal advice.   

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte communication is communication with the Judge with only one party present.     If 
you  have  something  you  need  to  tell  the  Judge,  you  must  ask  for  a  hearing  and  give 
notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and send a copy of 
the written statement to the other party. 

ituations  that  Need  an  Attorney.    Federal  law  may  impact  the  division  of 
retirement benefits, employer-provided health insurance, or other benefits which arise out 
of the employment of either party,  and your settlement terms may not be honored by the 
employer or the plan administrator of the employee benefits plan if your divorce decree is 
not properly completed or if a “qualified domestic relations order” (QDRO) is required.  
In addition, in the division of retirement benefits, there may be tax consequences which 
you  may  not  anticipate.    If  your  divorce  involves  issues  like  these,  see  an  attorney  to 
discuss tax consequences or the terms of a QDRO, or, if dealing with insurance issues, a 
“qualified medical child support order.” 

n addition to the above situations, you should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence  
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You or the other party are contemplating filing bankruptcy 
  You  or  the  other  party  expect  to  receive  money  because  of  a  personal 

injury 

  You or the other party own a business 
  You or the other party have significant assets or debts 
  You or the other party own real estate 

ruthfulness.    It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.

You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury). 

nauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those  persons  who  are  doing  their  own  divorce.    It  may  be  an  unauthorized  practice  of 
law  for  a  person  who  is  not  a  licensed  attorney  to  assist  others  in  obtaining  a  divorce.  
Such practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou are reminded that if you choose to continue without an attorney, you are 
expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has said: 
“A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any other 
litigant  and  he  must  expect  and  receive…the  same  treatment  as  if  represented  by  an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
