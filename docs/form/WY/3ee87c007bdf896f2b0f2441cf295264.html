OVERVIEW 
 
People  who  appear  for  themselves  without  an  attorney  are  considered  to  be  “self-
represented” and are also known as “pro se” litigants.  This packet is often referred to as 
the “pro se divorce packet.”   These packets  work best  when parties  are able to  agree, 
and  become  more  difficult  when  there  are  children,  disagreements  about  property, 
financial interests, violence, harassment or coercion. Many areas of family law are very 
complicated, and some courts in the State of Wyoming require certain things that others 
courts  do  not.    Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  include  all  legal  solutions  available  to 
people in a divorce action in a single packet.  Again, this packet will be most useful for 
people involved in an uncontested divorce (i.e., you both agree on all matters).  There 
are other types of actions available, including temporary orders on child custody, support, 
alimony and restraining orders that are not included in this packet and might be easier to 
obtain with an attorney.  These forms have been created to  benefit the majority of people 
who  represent  themselves  while  also  understanding  that  people  with  complex  or 
emergency  circumstances  may  continue  to  find  themselves  better  served  by  getting  an 
attorney.  We hope you find this packet and the resources that it contains helpful.    

DOMESTIC/FAMILY VIOLENCE:   
If you or your children have been a victim of family (domestic) violence, it is recommended that you find 
an  attorney  to  help  you.      There  may  be  assistance  available  even  if  you  cannot  afford  an  attorney.  
Contact the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-0992), Legal 
Aid of Wyoming (1-877-432-9955) or the Wyoming State Bar (1-307-632-9061) www.wyomingbar.org.  
If  you  have  concerns  about  confidential  information  such  as  addresses  and/or  social  security  numbers, 
please  consult  an  attorney  and  do  not  attempt  to  do  this  on  your  own.  You  should  also  know  that 
Protection  Orders  and  Stalking  Orders  are  available  free  of  charge  at  the  circuit  court  clerk’s  office.   
Please  call  the  Wyoming  Coalition  Against  Domestic  Violence  &  Sexual  Assault  for  assistance  in 
obtaining domestic violence protection or stalking orders (1-307-755-0992).   If you have ever obtained a 
protection order involving your spouse, you should include this information in the Complaint for Divorce 
or Counterclaim under the “Other Proceedings” section.  
 

   

   

 

 

 

This  information  packet  is  intended  to  provide  general  information  to  obtain  a 
divorce.  
There  is  no  guarantee  these  forms  are  still  accurate  and/or  current.    The 
information in this packet is not intended to replace an attorney.   
If  you represent  yourself, YOU PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You must 
decide which forms apply to your situation.   
DO NOT USE all forms, as some forms may not apply.   
Fill out the necessary forms completely and correctly.   

Print  or  type  all  of  the  documents.  DO  NOT  SIGN  YOUR  NAME  WHERE 

THE JUDGE OR CLERK SHOULD SIGN. 

AWS:    All  laws  and rules  that  apply  to  attorneys  apply  to  you.    It  is  your 
responsibility to properly prepare and file the necessary documents.  The Judge will not

or make corrections for you. 

ou  should  read  Title  20  of  the  Wyoming  Statutes  (the  divorce  laws),  and  you 
should also read the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure.  Most of the District Courts in 
the State of Wyoming have a courthouse library or county library where these laws and 
rules  can  be  read.    You  may  also  look  up  these  laws  and  rules  on  the  internet  at: 
www.courts.state.wy.us and clicking on “law library.”  Some courts have special forms 
they want  you to use in  addition to the forms contained in this packet.   Check with the 
clerk before you file your documents. 

lerks May Not Help You Fill Out the Forms.  Unless your county has a court 
facilitator,  employees  in  the  Clerk  of  District  Court’s  office  and  in  the  Judge’s  office 
cannot help you or give you legal advice.  

he Judge Cannot Talk to You, Answer Your Questions or Assist You.   Ex 
parte communication is communication with the Judge with only one party present.     If 
you  have  something  you  need  to  tell  the  Judge,  you  must  ask  for  a  hearing  and  give 
notice to the other party or file a written statement in the Court file and send a copy of 
the written statement to the other party. 

ituations  that  Need  an  Attorney.    Federal  law  may  impact  the  division  of 
retirement benefits, employer-provided health insurance, or other benefits which arise out 
of the employment of either party, and your settlement terms may not be honored by the 
employer or the plan administrator of the employee benefits plan if your divorce decree is 
not properly completed or if a “qualified domestic relations order” (QDRO) is required.  
In addition, in the division of retirement benefits, there may be tax consequences which 
you  may  not  anticipate.    If  your  divorce  involves  issues  like  these,  see  an  attorney  to 
discuss tax consequences or the terms of a QDRO, or, if dealing with insurance issues or 
a “qualified medical child support order.”   

n addition to the above situations, you should consult an attorney if: 

  You are a victim of domestic/family violence 
  The other party hires an attorney 
  You or the other party are contemplating filing bankruptcy 
  You  or  the  other  party  expect  to  receive  money  because  of  a  personal 

injury 

  You or the other party own a business 
  You or the other party have significant assets or debts 
  You or the other party own real estate 

ruthfulness.  It  is  absolutely  essential  that  you  be  completely  honest  and 
accurate in completing all forms.  There are penalties for attempting to mislead the Court.  
You  should  read  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11  (representations  to  the 
court) and Wyoming Statute § 6-5-301 (perjury).

Unauthorized  Practice  of  Law  Notice.    The  purpose  of  this  packet  is  to  assist 
those  persons  who  are  doing  their  own  divorce.    It  may  be  an  unauthorized  practice  of 
law  for  a  person  who  is  not  a  licensed  attorney  to  assist  others  in  obtaining  a  divorce.  
Such practice could subject a guilty party to punishment for contempt of court. 

ou are reminded that if you choose to continue without an attorney, you are 
expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Wyoming Supreme Court has said: 
“A pro se litigant (one without an attorney) will be granted no greater right than any other 
litigant  and  he  must  expect  and  receive…the  same  treatment  as  if  represented  by  an 
attorney…”  In other words, if you do not have an attorney you will be held to the 
same standards as a person with an attorney.

your spouse must live in Wyoming for at least sixty (60) days immediately before you file, 
or 2) you must have been married in Wyoming and you or your spouse must have lived in

are not complete, the Judge may reject your packet.   

tep 1.  Getting  Started.    The  following  forms  are  required  in  all  uncontested

1.  Civil Cover Sheet 
2.  Vital Statistics form 
3.  Complaint for Divorce (with Children) 
4.  Summons  
5.  Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service

are needed, they will be discussed below where applicable.   

tep 2. 

File  your  divorce  case.    A  divorce  case  begins  with  the  filing  of  a 
Complaint for Divorce.  A Complaint for Divorce is a written request to the court for a divorce.  
The  person  who  originally  asks  for  this  legal  action  is  called  the  Plaintiff  and  remains  the 
Plaintiff throughout the case.

Notarizing  Signatures.    You  will  need  to  sign  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  and  have  it  notarized.  
Notarial Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, or in many cases, Clerks of Court 
will be willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each Clerk’s office has their own policy so check with 
them first before seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.   

Where to file. You will file your case in the District Court in the county where either you 
or your spouse resides. The Complaint for Divorce is given to the Clerk of the District Court, 
whose office is usually located in the county courthouse or a branch of the county courthouse.  A 
list of the Clerks of District Court for each Judicial District is included in the packet.  A filing fee 
is required.  Ask the Clerk what the amount of the filing fee is and what forms of payment are 
accepted.  

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.”  The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and complaint stating the name of 
the Plaintiff, the Defendant, the District Court the case is filed in and the case number. 

Other forms to file with the Complaint. 

A.  When  you  file  the  Complaint  for  Divorce,  you  will  also  need  to  file  the  Civil 

Cover Sheet.  Follow the instructions that accompany this form. 

. 

You  will  also  need  to  file  the  Vital  Statistics  form.    Fill  out  all  portions  of  this 
form EXCEPT the “Decree” section, which will be completed by the Clerk when your divorce is 
final.   

. 

You will also need to fill out and file a Confidential Statement of the Parties for 
Child Support Order.  This  form  provides the Court with  personal  information  (such as social 
security numbers and birth dates) of the parties involved in your case as required by statute, but 
permits  the  information  to  be  located  in  a  confidential  file  so  that  the  general  public  does  not 
have access to the information.   

You will also need to have the Clerk sign (a/k/a “issue”) the Summons. 

How many copies. Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s 
office.  The Clerk will give copies of each document back to you after stamping them with the 
date they were filed.  This is called a “file stamp.”  You should keep one copy of each document 
for your records.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Defendant.

Summary of Step 2:  To start your divorce case, you will need to file the following documents with the  Clerk of 
the District Court’s office located in the county courthouse in the county where either you or your spouse resides: 

A.  Civil Cover Sheet 

B.  Vital Statistics Form   

a.    Follow the instructions that accompany this form for help completing it correctly;  

a.  Fill out all portions, EXCEPT the “Decree” section, which will be completed by the  Clerk 

when your divorce is final; 
C.  Complaint for Divorce (with Children);  
D.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order; and 
E.   Summons;  
F.  Pay the filing fee; 
G.  Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.   
a.  The Clerk will give both copies back to you after file-stamping them.  
b.  You should keep one copy for your records.  
c.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Defendant (Step 3). 

tep 3. 

Serve the Defendant.  The person against whom the original legal action 
is being requested is called the Defendant and remains the Defendant throughout the case.  The 
Defendant is expected to file an answer to the Complaint for Divorce.  
 

Once your case has been filed with the Clerk, a file-stamped copy of the paperwork must 
be formally given to (a/k/a served on) the Defendant.  The Defendant needs to be served with the 
Complaint for Divorce, the Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order, and 
the  Summons  so  the  Court  has  proof  that  he  or  she  received  the  papers.   A  Sheriff  must 
personally serve  the Complaint  for Divorce, Confidential  Statement  of the Parties for Child 
Support  Order,  and  the  Summons  on  the  Defendant,  unless  the  Defendant  completes  an 
Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form.   Other  forms  of  service  exist,  but  these 
are the two easiest methods that meet the formal service requirement for a  Complaint for 
Divorce.  If you cannot serve the Defendant by either of these methods, ask the Clerk for 
additional forms for alternative methods of service.  These forms are also available in Pro 
Se Packet 10.   
 

You MUST give the Defendant official notice that you have filed for divorce within 90 
days from the date you filed the Complaint for Divorce and Confidential Statement of the Parties 
for  Child  Support  Order.    This  is  done  by  serving  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  the 
Complaint  for  Divorce,  and  the  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order 
upon  the  Defendant  or  by  having  the  Defendant  sign  an  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of 
Service  form  stating  that  copies  of  those  documents  were  received.    If  you  do  not  serve  the 
Defendant within 90 days, your case can be dismissed by the Court. 

How to Serve the Defendant.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to

Summons.  It is recommended to have a Sheriff in the county where the Defendant can 
be  found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 

Family Law Information and Instructions (With Children) 
Revised September 2019 
Page 3 of 15 
 

($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).   You can contact the Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the Defendant lives to determine the fee charged by the Sheriff.  This is also true if your spouse 
is going to be served out of state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff in the county where your 
spouse  resides  with  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Complaint  for  Divorce,  and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order to be served on the Defendant. 
 

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called 
the “Return” (or they may have their own form – an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the  original  with  the  Clerk’s  office  and  send  you  a  copy.    If  you  receive  what  looks  like  the 
original “Return” or “Affidavit of Service” from the Sheriff, call the Clerk’s office to ensure the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the Defendant was given proper notice. 
 

Note:   Once the  Defendant  has been served,  you MUST  file the original  Summons and 
the Return (or Affidavit of Service) with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that 
proper service was made. 
 

ption 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.  If the Defendant agrees, he or she 
may sign a form  stating  that a  file-stamped copy of the  Summons, Complaint for  Divorce, and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order were received.  If the Defendant 
agrees,  you  will  need  to  fill  out  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form.    The 
Defendant must sign this document in front of a notarial officer.  

Proof of Service.  Once the Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form is signed, 
the original and two (2) copies of the signed form must go to the Clerk’s office for filing.  You 
should keep one copy for your records and provide the other copy to the Defendant. 
 

Note:    You  must  file  the  signed  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  AND  the 
Summons with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper service was made 
on the Defendant.    

Summary of Step 3:  You MUST give the Defendant official notice that you have filed for divorce within 90 days 
from the date you filed the Complaint for Divorce.  Choose one of the following methods: 
Option 1 – Service by Sheriff 

A.  Provide a file-stamped copy of the  Summons, Complaint for Divorce,  and Confidential Statement of the 

Parties for Child Support Order to the Sheriff where the Defendant lives; 

B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once the Defendant is served, be sure the original Summons and the original Return or Affidavit of Service 

are filed with the Clerk’s office; OR 

Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 

A.  Provide a file-stamped copy of the  Summons, Complaint for Divorce,  and Confidential Statement of the 

Parties for Child Support Order to the Defendant; 

B.  Have  the  Defendant  sign  the  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  in  front  of  a  notarial 

officer;  

C.  File the original Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form with the Clerk’s office; and 
D.  File the original Summons with the Clerk’s office

•  While waiting, move on to Step 5.  You can also use this time to continue to work on 

the other required forms to be sure they are filled out completely and correctly. 

  •

Step 4.  Wait for  the  Defendant’s  time  to  Answer  to  expire.    Once 
the Defendant is served, he or she has 20 days (if served in the State of Wyoming) or 30 days (if 
served  out-of-state)  to  file  an  Answer  to  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    You  must  wait  for  the 
appropriate time period to expire before you can proceed with the divorce case.  You must wait 
the 20 days (or 30 days if served out-of-state) even if the Defendant tells you that he or she is not 
going to file an Answer.  

Summary  of  Step  4:    You  MUST  wait  for  the  Defendant’s  time  to  file  an  Answer  to  expire  before  you  can 
proceed with your divorce case.  In the meantime: 

A. 
B. 
C. 

Mark on the calendar when the Defendant’s time to Answer expires; 
Move on to Step 5 while waiting; and 
Use this time to ensure the required forms are filled out completely and correctly. 

tep  5.              Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Defendant’s Answer is required to be 
served on the Plaintiff (use the table in 5.A. below to determine date).  The information consists 
of  a  schedule  of  financial  assets;  schedule  of  non-financial  assets;  schedule  of  all  debts  owed 
individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information; 
information  regarding  other  income  and  retirement  accounts;  and  a  summary  of  the  facts 
believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child custody is at issue.  
Both  parties  are  required  to  provide  this  information  in  order  to  fully  disclose  finances  of  the 
parties relating to the calculation of child support.   

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

A.  WHEN TO  PROVIDE:    Initial Disclosures must  be provided to  the Defendant 
(or  his/her  attorney)  WITHIN  30  DAYS  AFTER  THE  DEFENDANT’S  ANSWER  IS 
REQUIRED TO BE SERVED ON YOU (use table below).  Be sure to keep a copy of 
your  Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the 
date  when  you  and  the  Defendant  are  required  to  provide  initial  disclosures  to  one 
another.

Option A. The following instructions apply if  the  Defendant  filed an 
Answer  or  Answer  and  Counterclaim,  and  you  both  agree  on  all  of 
the issues of your divorce.  If you and the Defendant agree on the issues involved in 
your divorce, then you will need to complete the following: 
 

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

A. 
 

B. 

C. 

 

 

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit including the 
required  attachments  with  the  Court.    If  the  Defendant  does  NOT  file  a 
Confidential  Financial  Affidavit,  you  will  need  to  complete  an  Affidavit  of 
Imputed Income to show the Court how much money the Defendant makes.  This 
is an additional form contained in your packet. 
 

•  Required  Attachments.    The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  of  the  parties 
must be supported with documentation of both current and past earnings. Proper 
documentation  of  current  earnings  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  pay  stubs, 
employer  statements,  or  receipts  and  expenses  if  self-employed.  Documentation 
of  current  earnings  shall  be  supplemented  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  tax 
return to provide verification of earnings over a longer period. Include copies of 
income tax returns for the previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to 
show how much you have made so far this year. Be sure to also include copies of 
your health insurance cards, if applicable.  

Fill  out  an  Affidavit  for  Divorce  Without  Appearance  of  Parties.    This  form 
provides  the  admissible  evidence  the  Court  needs  to  enter  a  Decree  without 
requiring the parties to attend a hearing. 
 
Fill out a Decree of Divorce (with Children).  This form will need to be filled out 
completely,  signed  by  both  you  and  the  Defendant  and  both  of  your  signatures 
must  be  notarized.  In  addition  to  signing  the  Decree,  you  should  also  initial 
each  page  of  the  Decree  to  verify  that  each  page  contains  the  terms  you 
agreed upon. Here are some important laws and helpful hints in completing the 
Decree of Divorce: 

•  Custody  and  Visitation.    You  and  the  Defendant  need  to  determine  which 
custody and visitation plan will apply in your circumstances.  It is unusual for the 
Court  not  to  award  any  visitation  or  supervised  visitation  to  the  non-custodial 
parent.  
 

o 

 If  there  is  a  concern  that  your  child(ren)  may  be  harmed  by  the  other 
parent  physically  and/or  emotionally,  you  should  seek  advice  from 
someone  familiar  with  parenting  and  child  development  issues.    There 
may  be  an  organization  in  your  community  that  can  help  facilitate 
visitation between the children and you or the other parent.   You can also

contact  the  facilitators  of  any  parenting  classes  in  your  community  for 
other ideas.   

•  Factors to be considered for awarding custody and visitation.  The Decree of 
Divorce contains several options for custody and visitation arrangements.  Ideally, 
both  parents  will  work  together  to  select  the  proper  custody  and  visitation  plan 
depending upon the family circumstances.   In awarding custody and setting forth 
a  visitation  plan,  Wyoming  law  requires  that  the  Court  consider  the  following 
factors: 

 
The geographic location of each parent; 
Each  parent's  willingness  and  ability  to  perform  the  child  care 
duties  associated  with  the  child(ren),  relative  to  the  child(ren)'s 
stage of development such as feeding, changing, bathing, preparing 
the  child(ren)  for  school,  taking  responsibility  for  the  child(ren)'s 
homework, etc.; 
Each parent's ability to care for the child(ren)'s needs (consider not 
only historical involvement but a parent's willingness and ability to 
learn the necessary skills, as well); 
The lack of hostility between the parents; 
The  ability  of  both  parents'  work  schedules  and  the  child(ren)'s 
schedule to accommodate extended access; 
The child(ren)'s age(s) and strength of attachment to each parent; 
The child(ren)'s relationship with his/her friends. 
 

•  Child(ren)’s  interests  should  control.    The  use  of  a  calendar  for  scheduling 
purposes  is  highly  recommended.    The  parents'  work  schedules  and  the 
child(ren)'s  school  and  extracurricular  activities  need  to  be  considered  when 
developing a visitation plan.  This is especially true for those parents who do not 
enjoy  a  traditional  work  week.    While  visitation  should  be  an  enjoyable  and 
enriching experience, it is an obligation and responsibility for each parent as well 
as a right and a privilege.  Both parents must also have a good faith commitment 
to developing and carrying out a visitation plan.  You need to focus on what type 
of schedule would be in the child(ren)’s best interest.    

•  Parenting  classes.  At  any  time,  the  Court  may  require  parents  to  attend 
appropriate  parenting  classes,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  parenting  classes  to 
lessen the effects of divorce on children.   Both  parents are generally required to 
attend  classes  when  they  are  ordered.    If  the  class  is  ordered,  you  MUST  file  a 
Certificate of Completion with the Clerk’s office.  This certificate is provided by 
the class instructor. 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Defendant completed (or by the Affidavit of Imputed Income if the Defendant did 
not  complete  his/her  own  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit).    You  may  use  the

Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to  help  you  calculate  the  support 
due  or  contact  your  local  child  support  enforcement  agency  for  assistance.    
Another option is to go online to: 
https://childsupport.wyoming.gov/calculator/index.html 
to calculate child support. 

➢  You  CANNOT  agree  that  no  support  will  be  paid.    Wyoming  law 
allows for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical 
custody, each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the year, and both parents contribute substantially to 
the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   
 

➢  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include the specific reasons for deviation in the Decree of Divorce.  

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  TITLE  19,  KID  CARE,  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the net income of you and the Defendant even if you 
and the Defendant agree to a lower amount of support. 

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable  cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to  pay for 
expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for

which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Plaintiff  and  50%  to 
Defendant). 

 

D. 

Fill  out  an  Order  for  Income  Withholding.   The  Court  is  required  by  statute  to 

enter an Order for Income Withholding in every case where child support has been ordered.   

E. 

 
Fill out an Income Withholding for Support.  This form is required if you need to 
have  the  child  support  paid  directly  from  a  non-custodial  parent’s  employer.    If  you  need 
assistance  in  filling  out  this  form,  or  if  you  need  assistance  in  collecting  child  support,  you 
should contact the child support enforcement agency in your district.  The Clerk can provide you 
with the agency’s contact information. 

.    Other Forms:  Other forms may be required depending on the county where your 
case is filed.  Ask the Clerk if additional forms are required before your Decree of Divorce will 
be entered.  

. 

Copies and Envelopes.  Take an original and two (2) copies of each of the above 
documents for filing with the Clerk and two (2) addressed, stamped envelopes (one addressed to 
you  and  one  to  the  Defendant  with  enough  postage  to  cover  the  cost  of  mailing  the  Decree  of 
Divorce  to  you  and  the  Defendant).      A  copy  of  any  documents  that  you  file  (other  than  the 
Decree  of  Divorce)  must  be  sent  to  the  Defendant  on  the  date  that  you  filled  out  on  the 
Certificate of Service on each document.   
 

➢  If  a  hearing  is  not  required  by  your  Court,  the  Clerk  will  mail  a  copy  of  your 

Decree of Divorce if accepted by the Court.  
 

➢   If a hearing is required by your Court, follow the next steps: 

. 

Hearing.    In  some  Courts,  a  hearing  is  required  before  the  Judge  will  sign  the 
Decree  of  Divorce.    If  this  is  the  case,  you  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  the 
Request for Setting.  If you have reached an agreement, check the box that states that the parties 
have reached an agreement.  Indicate how much time you will need for the hearing (usually 15 
minutes  if  there  is  an  agreement).    You  will  file  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  with  the  Clerk’s 
office,  and  the  Court  will  fill  in  the  hearing  date  and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the 
Defendant.  You will need to provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Defendant 
to the Clerk.  These documents are additional forms that are contained in your packet. 

. 

Evidence.    At  the  hearing,  you  will  need  to  tell  the  Judge  that  either  1)  you  or 
your  spouse  have  lived  in  Wyoming  for  at  least  60  days  immediately  before  you  filed  the 
Complaint for Divorce, or 2) you and your spouse were married in Wyoming and at least one of 
you has lived in Wyoming ever since.  You will also need to tell the Judge about irreconcilable 
differences in the marriage (why you want a divorce), and why the settlement you reached (who 
gets what) is fair.

the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk  that  the 
Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is final.

Request  a  trial  date.    You  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  a 
Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  Indicate how much time 
you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your  evidence  and  write  that  in 
(usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether or not you want a  Court 
reporter  to  record  the  proceeding.    SEE  BELOW  FOR  DETAILS  ON  GETTING  A  COURT 
REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a transcript of the hearing 
will not be available.   It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not get a Court 
reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   

 

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and 
Requesting Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the

hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the other party.  You will need to 
provide  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the  Defendant  to  the  Clerk.  
Both  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and  Requiring 
Pretrial Statements are additional forms contained in your packet. 

D. 

Pretrial  Disclosures.    Both  parties  must  provide  to  the  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.  
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Defendant (or his/her attorney). 

E. 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must present the Court with the completed and signed Decree of Divorce before the Court will 
take  the  trial  off  of  the  schedule.  There  will  be  no  continuances  or  canceling  of  the  trial  date 
based  on  telephone  calls.    If  you  need  a  continuance,  you  should  contact  an  attorney  for 
assistance in seeking one.  

.       Court reporter.  If you wish to have a court reporter you shall provide notice to 
the official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days before 
the  matter  is  set  for  hearing.    You  can  provide  notice  to  the  court  reporter  by  phone  or  by 
submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the mail, the request 
must be received by the court reporter no later than three working days prior to the hearing.  The 
Clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day  notice 
requirement  will  not  be  waived  by  the  Court.    The  notice  is  required  for  all  civil  matters 
including jury trials.  
 

G. 

 Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Divorce Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered 
(signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the  information 
requested in that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a 
list  of  your  proposed  witnesses  and  what  their  testimony  is  going  to  be  about  within  the  time 
frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you 
or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 
 

H. 

Final Decision (Decree of Divorce).  Following the trial, the Judge will make a 
decision or may take the matter under advisement, meaning he or she will need to think further 
before making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type 
it into the Decree of Divorce incorporating the Judge’s decision. 

 

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Judge will not

the law. 
 

➢  You MUST also file the documents outlined in Step 6, Option A, items A and 

C through G above. 

I.      When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk of Court.  This process may take 
time  if  the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk’s 
office that the Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is 
final.  The time limit to appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed

of pleadings or other papers as required by law.  This form, approved by the Wyoming Supreme Court, is required 
for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet. Consequently, a civil cover sheet

I. 
Nature  of  Suit.    Place  an  “X”  in  the  appropriate  box.    ONE  AND  ONLY  ONE  BOX  SHOULD  BE

A NOTE ABOUT MARITAL vs. NON-MARITAL ASSETS AND DEBTS 
 

In the following tables you will be asked to distinguish marital property/debt from non-marital 
(separate) property/debt.  Marital property/debt will be divided between you and your spouse as 
part of the divorce; non-marital property/debt usually will not be divided (depending on the 
situation). 

he general rule is that marital property and debt is any property or debt acquired during the 
marriage for the benefit of the marriage, regardless of who paid for it or whose name is on it. 
However, just because a party acquired property before marriage does not necessarily mean that 
it won’t be considered marital property. A spouse's premarital separate property can become 
marital when a married couple demonstrates an intent, through their words or actions during 
marriage, to treat one spouse's separate property as marital property. Gifts and inheritances are 
generally separate property, although gifts for the benefit of the marriage, such as a dishwasher, 
may be considered marital property. 

During the marriage" generally means from the time of marriage until the time of separation. 

eople often dispute what property/debt is marital or how long the marriage lasted. When this 
happens, you are urged to consult with an attorney to learn about the various legal arguments that 
may be available to you.

 ______ weekly   
 ______ every two weeks  
 ______ twice per month (i.e. 1st and 15th of every month) 
 ______ monthly 
_______annually 

Convert annual, bi- weekly, bi-monthly, and weekly amounts to monthly amounts below. 
**  Gross  income  (includes  tips,  commission  and  bonuses).    Monthly  amounts  are  calculated  by 
multiplying weekly amount by 52 and dividing by 12; multiplying bi-weekly amounts by 26 and dividing 
by 12; and multiplying semi-monthly amounts by 24 and dividing by 12; annually by dividing by 12.  If 
only the “gross income” is known, multiply that number by .25 (or other number if instructed by Court) and 
then  subtract  that  amount  from  the  gross  to  arrive  at  the  net  monthly  income.  If  the  other  party  has  a 
history of only working for minimum wage or less, and is capable, to your knowledge of working 40 
hours/week, the court may impute his/her income at $1,141.25 net monthly for a noncustodial parent 
and $1,185.67 net monthly for a custodial parent.  You may call your local child support enforcement 
office  for  more  information  on  imputing  a  custodial  or  non-custodial  parent’s  wage.  Federal  minimum 
wage is $7.25/hour as of July 1, 2012.

$_____________ per month, to the best of my information and belief. 

 Plaintiff’s OR  

 Defendant’s estimated gross income (before deductions) is: 

Income" means any form of payment or return in money or in kind to an individual, regardless of source. 
Income  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  wages,  earnings,  salary,  commission,  compensation  as  an 
independent  contractor,  temporary  total  disability,  permanent  partial  disability  and  permanent  total 
disability  worker's  compensation  payments,  unemployment  compensation,  disability,  annuity  and 
retirement benefits, and any other payments made by any payor, but shall not include any earnings derived 
from  overtime  work  unless  the  court,  after  considering  all  overtime  earnings  derived  in  the  preceding 
twenty-four (24) month period, determines the overtime  earnings can reasonably be expected to continue 
on  a  consistent  basis.  In  determining  income,  all  reasonable  unreimbursed  legitimate  business  expenses 
shall be deducted. Means tested sources of income such as Pell grants, aid under the personal opportunities 
with employment responsibilities (POWER) program, food stamps and supplemental security income (SSI) 
shall  not  be  considered  as  income.  Gross  income  also  means  potential  income  of  parents  who  are 
voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. 
  
"Net  income"  means  income  as  defined  in  the  box  above,  less  personal  income  taxes,  social  security 
deductions, cost of dependent health care coverage for all dependent children, actual payments being made 
under  preexisting  support  orders  for  current  support  of  other  children,  other  court-ordered  support 
obligations  currently  being  paid  and  mandatory  pension  deductions.  Payments  towards  child  support 
arrearage shall not be deducted to arrive at net income.

n accordance with W.S. § 20-2-304(f), if the difference between the noncustodial parent’s net income 
and the self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from the tables above, the 
support obligation shall be set using the difference between the noncustodial parent’s net income and 
the  self-support  reserve.  “Self-support  reserve”  means  the  current  poverty  line  for  one  (1)  person as 
specified by the poverty  guidelines updated periodically  in the  Federal Register by the United States 
department of health and human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See Table D on

OTE:  If the custody of the children is shared or split as defined under Wyo. Stat. § 20-2-304 (c) and (d) 
other formulas apply.  If “split” (meaning each parent has physical custody of at least one (1) child), the 
amount  shall  be  allocated  to  each  parent  based  upon  the  number  of  those  children  in  the  physical 
custody of that parent (see Table C on page 3). If “shared” (meaning each parent has actual overnight 
custody  of  the  children  for  a  certain  percentage  of  time),  the  amount  will  be  allocated  based  on  the 
percentage of time (Table B below).   
 

B.    SHARED  PHYSICAL  CUSTODY:    Wyo.  Stat.  §  20-2-304  (c)  provides  for  special  support 
computation of support when each parent keeps the children overnight for more than  twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the expenses of the children 
in  addition  to  the  payment  of  child  support.  If this is the custodial arrangement, support may be 
computed as follows assuming all other statutory provisions apply.

D.    SELF-SUPPORT  RESERVE  COMPUTATION:    Wyo.  Stat.  §  20-2-304  (f)  provides  for 
special computation  of  support  when the  difference between  the  obligor’s net income  and the  self-
support  reserve  is  less  than  the  support  obligation  as  calculated  using  the  support  tables  for 
presumptive support on page 1.  In such cases, the support should be computed as follows:

aware the court may punish  as perjury  any materially false statements knowingly made

THIS MATTER having come before the Court upon a Request for Setting, and the Court 

being generally advised in the premises;  

IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  a  trial  of  the  above  matter  is  hereby  scheduled  for

(____) minutes/hour(s)/day(s) has been set aside for the trial of this matter.  

            IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each party shall file and serve on the opposing party or 

their attorney, if represented, no later than five (5) days prior to the trial, the party’s sworn statement 

setting forth the facts, to the best of the party’s knowledge and belief, called for by Section “A” of 

the attached list of information, and a statement by counsel (attorney), if any, of the client’s position 

and proof as called for by Section “B.”  These filings are required to narrow and simplify the issues, 

prevent surprise and to eliminate unnecessary proof.  The material may be presented in narrative 

form but must be complete for purposes called for by this order.  To avoid duplication, the parties or 

their attorneys, if any, may submit a joint statement of those items not in dispute. 

 

Any party requesting the reporting of a particular matter by the official court reporter 

shall make a request to the appropriate official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later 

than three (3) working days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the 

court reporter by phone or by submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing

Uniform Rules of the District Courts of the State of Wyoming. 

In the event that this case settles, the parties are informed that there will be no change in the 

scheduling of this matter by the Court until such time as the settlement is reduced to writing and a 

written agreement is presented to the court.  There will be no continuances or canceling of the trial 

date based on telephone calls.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYERS/INCOME WITHHOLDERS 
 
State-specific contact and withholding information can be found on the Federal Employer Services website located at: 
http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/newhire/employer/contacts/contact_map.htm  

riority:  Withholding for support has priority over any other legal process under State law against the same income 

(USC 42 §666(b)(7)).  If a Federal tax levy is in effect, please notify the sender.  

ombining Payments: When remitting payments to an SDU or Tribal CSE agency, you may combine withheld amounts 

from more than one employee/obligor’s income in a single payment.  You must, however, separately identify each 
employee/obligor’s portion of the payment. 

Payments To SDU: You must send child support payments payable by income withholding to the appropriate SDU or to a 
Tribal CSE agency. If this IWO instructs you to send a payment to an entity other than an SDU (e.g., payable to the 
custodial party, court, or attorney), you must check the box above and return this notice to the sender.  Exception: If this 
IWO was sent by a Court, Attorney, or Private Individual/Entity and the initial order was entered before January 1, 1994 or 
the order was issued by a Tribal CSE agency, you must follow the “Remit payment to” instructions on this form.  

eporting the Pay Date: You must report the pay date when sending the payment. The pay date is the date on which the 

amount was withheld from the employee/obligor’s wages.  You must comply with the law of the State (or Tribal law if 
applicable) of the employee/obligor’s principal place of employment regarding time periods within which you must 
implement the withholding and forward the support payments. 

Multiple IWOs: If there is more than one IWO against this employee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IWOs 
due to Federal, State, or Tribal withholding limits, you must honor all IWOs to the greatest extent possible, giving priority 
to current support before payment of any past-due support.  Follow the State or Tribal law/procedure of the 
employee/obligor’s principal place of employment to determine the appropriate allocation method. 

ump Sum Payments: You may be required to notify a State or Tribal CSE agency of upcoming lump sum payments to 

this employee/obligor such as bonuses, commissions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to determine if you are 
required to report and/or withhold lump sum payments. 

iability: If you have any doubts about the validity of this IWO, contact the sender.  If you fail to withhold income from the 
employee/obligor’s income as the IWO directs, you are liable for both the accumulated amount you should have withheld 
and any penalties set by State or Tribal law/procedure. _____________________________________________________  
 _________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 _________________________________________________________________________________________________  

nti-discrimination: You are subject to a fine determined under State or Tribal law for discharging an employee/obligor 

from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against an employee/obligor because of this IWO.

OMB Expiration Date – 05/31/2014.  The OMB Expiration Date has no bearing on the termination date of the IWO; it identifies the

Withholding Limits: You may not withhold more than the lesser of:  1) the amounts allowed by the Federal Consumer 
Credit Protection Act (CCPA) (15 U.S.C. 1673(b)); or 2) the amounts allowed by the State or Tribe of the 
employee/obligor’s principal place of employment (see REMITTANCE INFORMATION).  Disposable income is the net 
income left after making mandatory deductions such as: State, Federal, local taxes; Social Security taxes; statutory 
pension contributions; and Medicare taxes.  The Federal limit is 50% of the disposable income if the obligor is supporting 
another family and 60% of the disposable income if the obligor is not supporting another family. However, those limits 
increase 5% - to 55% and 65% - if the arrears are greater than 12 weeks.  If permitted by the State or Tribe, you may 
deduct a fee for administrative costs.  The combined support amount and fee may not exceed the limit indicated in this 
section. 

 

  

or Tribal orders, you may not withhold more than the amounts allowed under the law of the issuing Tribe.  For Tribal 

employers/income withholders who receive a State IWO, you may not withhold more than the lesser of the limit set by the 
law of the jurisdiction in which the employer/income withholder is located or the maximum amount permitted under section 
303(d) of the CCPA (15 U.S.C. 1673 (b)). 

epending upon applicable State or Tribal law, you may need to also consider the amounts paid for health care premiums 

in determining disposable income and applying appropriate withholding limits.     

rrears greater than 12 weeks? If the Order Information does not indicate that the arrears are greater than 12 weeks, 

then the Employer should calculate the CCPA limit using the lower percentage.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
