      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLYING 
FOR A 
SEXUAL ASSAULT PROTECTION ORDER 
IN WYOMING 
 
A sexual assault protection order is a civil order issued by the court on behalf of a sexual 
assault victim.  The order can require the alleged perpetrator to stay away from the victim 
or place(s) where the victim lives or works and to have no further contact with the victim. 

ny person 18 or older who is a victim of sexual assault – including a single incident – 
may petition the court to obtain the order.  Victims under 18 need a parent or guardian to 
petition on their behalf.  A third party may also file on behalf of a vulnerable adult or any 
other adult who cannot file due to age, disability, health or inaccessibility. 

he  sexual  assault  protection  order  is  designed  for  victims  who  do  not  meet  the 
“household member” requirement with the person who sexually assaulted them to qualify 
for a domestic violence protection order.  If you are considering petitioning for a sexual 
assault protection order, you should meet with a sexual assault advocate or a lawyer to 
discuss the different available remedies and challenges with the various orders.   

 Sexual Assault Protection Order may also be obtained as part of a criminal case.  If a 
victim  reports  the  sexual  assault  to  law  enforcement  and  the  assailant  is  being 
prosecuted, a judge may order the perpetrator to keep the assailant away from the victim 
when they are released from custody. 

 
Petitioning the court for a Sexual Assault Protection Order does not guarantee 
your safety or that the alleged perpetrator or Respondent will comply with the 
terms of such an order.  

For help in developing a safety plan or about protection orders and how to get one, contact 
your local domestic violence program (see Crisis Intervention in the Yellow Pages) or call the 
Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault at (844) 264-8080 (toll free) 
or (307) 755-0992 or Wyoming Division of Victim’s Services at (888) 996-8816 or the National 
Domestic  Violence  Hotline  at  (800)  799-SAFE  (7233)  or  (512)  453-8117  (multi-lingual 
advocates are available); TTY: (800) 787-3224.  

  
ead  all  the  instructions  before  completing  forms  to  ensure  that  you  qualify  to 
seek  a  sexual  assault  protection order  in  Wyoming.    YOU  DON’T NEED  TO  FILL 
OUT  EVERY  FORM.    ONLY  FILL  OUT  THE  INFORMATION  SHEET  AND  THE 
PETITION.  Keep the other forms, as you may need them at a later date.

of  the  allegations  and  will  have  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  by  the  court  at  the 
hearing. 

You  should  be  prepared  to  present  witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  prove  the 
sexual assault allegations at the hearing whenever possible.  If the Respondent 
does not receive notice of  the  hearing  from  the  Sheriff  at  least  twenty-four (24) 
hours before the hearing the hearing may be rescheduled to a later date.  You may 
have to contact the clerk of the circuit court where you filed the petition to make 
sure  that  the  Respondent  received  proper  notice  of  the  hearing.    The  Ex  parte 
Temporary Order of Protection will include terms the Court deems necessary and 
sufficient to protect the Petitioner and other persons and will contain a date and 
time within seventy-two (72) hours,  or as  soon  thereafter as  the  matter may  be 
heard, for a hearing on the petition. 

3. 

If  the  Court    finds    from  the  evidence  at  the  hearing  that  sexual  assault  has 
occurred, an Order of Protection will be issued for up to three (3) years, containing 
terms and conditions prohibiting further contact and/or sexual assault.  

DURATION OF ORDERS 

If the judge gives you a Sexual Assault Protection Order, it will be in effect for up 
to three (3) years and you may ask the court to extend the order upon a showing of good 
cause  that  a  clear  and  present  danger  to  the  victim  continues  to  exist,  for  additional 
periods  of  time  not  to  exceed  three  years  each.    The  Respondent  may  object  to  the 
extension  and  another hearing  may  be  set.    Judges  may  differ  on  what  they  consider 
"good  cause."    In  the  event  you  desire  an  extension  of  the  Order  of  Protection,  the 
request for extension must be filed prior to the expiration of the existing order and must 
contain information for the Court to consider in determining whether to extend the existing 
order.  It is recommended that you not wait until the last minute to ask for an extension.  
You may want to contact an attorney for advice prior to filing for an extension. 

MERGENCY ASSISTANCE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT: 

A  victim  of  sexual  assault  may  request  the  assistance  of  law  enforcement 
agencies which may take necessary steps to protect the victim including advisement of 
the remedies in Wyoming Statutes §7-3-506 through 7-3-512, advising the victim, when 
appropriate, of the procedure for initiating a sexual assault action or criminal proceedings 
and providing for or arranging for transportation of the victim to a medical facility or place 
of shelter.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
