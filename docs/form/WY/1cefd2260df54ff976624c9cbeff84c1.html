Instructions for Miscellaneous Forms 
 
This Packet contains forms that are not needed in most cases where the parties are representing 
themselves.  These forms supplement the packet(s) you have already purchased or downloaded 
from  the  Court.    Most  likely  you  will  only  need  to  use  these  additional  forms  for  one  of  the 
following areas:  
 

1.  Additional ways to serve a Defendant/Respondent – use if you are unable to have 
the  Defendant/Respondent  served  by  the  Sheriff  or  if  they  will  not  sign  an 
Acknowledgement or Acceptance of Service; 

2.  Waiver  of  Fees  –  use  if  you  are  financially  unable  to  pay  the  Court’s  filing  fees 

and/or the Sheriff’s service fees;  

3.  Motion  Forms  –  use  if  you  need  to  make  a  request  of  the  Court  (or  respond  to  a 
request) before the final order is entered (for example, request for temporary custody 
and/or support or requiring completion of financial affidavits); 

4.  Dismissal Forms – use if you would like to dismiss the action before a final order is 

entered; and 

5.  Notice of Change of Employment or Insurance  – this  form  is  for employers who 
need  to  report  a  change  for  their  employee’s  status  in  cases  where  a  child  support 
order has been issued. 

lease read through the instructions carefully concerning the form(s) that you need to use 

in your case. 

.  Additional  Ways  to  Serve  Defendant/Respondent.    If  you  were  unable  to 
serve  the  Defendant/Respondent  either  by  the  Sheriff  or  by  obtaining  an  Acknowledgement  or 
Acceptance  of  Service,  then  you  may  make  a  request  to  serve  the  Defendant/Respondent  by 
Publication or by Registered Mail.   

The following forms are required for service by Publication: 

a.  Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication 
b.  Notice of Publication 
c.  Affidavit Following Service by Publication

There are additional fees for service by publication.  Rule 4(e) of the Wyoming Rules of 
Civil Procedure states that service by publication is applicable “in suits for divorce, alimony, to 
affirm  or  declare  a  marriage  void,  or  the  modification  of  any  decree  therefore  entered  in  such 
suit,  when  the  defendant  is  a  nonresident  of  the  state,  or  the  defendant’s  residence  cannot  be 
ascertained, or the defendant keeps concealed in order to avoid service of process.”  If you are 
unsure whether or not  you are allowed to  serve  the Defendant/Respondent  by publication,  you 
need to consult with a lawyer.  However, if can demonstrate that you have made every effort to 
find the defendant’s address, completely fill out an Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication and 
Notice of Publication.  (DO NOT sign where the Clerk needs to sign).

Before service of publication can be made, an Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication 
must  be  filed  stating  that  service  of  Summons  cannot  be  made  within  this  state,  on  the 
Defendant/Respondent  to  be  served  by  publication,  and  listing  the  Defendant/Respondent’s 
address, if you know it, or that the Defendant/Respondent’s address is unknown.   

If the Defendant/Respondent’s address is UNKNOWN and cannot be found after making every effort to 
find  the  Defendant/Respondent’s  address,  the  affidavit  must  detail  the  efforts  you  made  to  obtain  an 
address. 

 If  the  other  party’s  address  is  KNOWN,  Wyoming  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  4(f)  states:  In  any 
case in which service by publication is made when the address of the  Defendant/Respondent  is known, 
the address must be stated in the publication.  Immediately after the first publication, the party making the 
service  shall  deliver  to  the  Clerk  copies  of  the  publication,  and  the  Clerk  shall  mail  a  copy  to  each 
Defendant/Respondent  whose  name  and  address  is  known  by  registered  or  certified  mail  and  marked 
“Restricted  Delivery”  with  return  receipt  requested,  directed  to  the  Defendant/Respondent’s  address 
listed, and make an entry thereof on the appearance docket.” [NOTE:  you must supply the Clerk with 
the  envelope  and  proper  postage  –  the  envelope  must  be  ready  to  mail  with  the  necessary  postal 
forms completed.]  

ontact the newspaper.  After the Clerk signs and files the Notice of Publication, it is 
your responsibility to  contact the appropriate newspaper and to  arrange for the publication and 
pay the appropriate fees.  An appropriate newspaper is one that has been regularly issued at least 
once  each  week  for  a  period  of  fifty-two  (52)  consecutive  weeks  prior  to  the  date  of  the  first 
publication of notice or advertisements.  It must have a paid circulation of at least five hundred 
(500) and each page must not be less than ten (10) inches by twelve and one-half inches in size.  
The newspaper must publish the notice once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks. 
  

Waiting  period.    The  other  party  will  have  thirty  (30)  days  from  the  date  of  the  last 
publication to file a written response to your complaint or modification petition.  After the thirty 
(30)-day  waiting  period,  fill  out,  sign  and  notarize  the  Affidavit  Following  Service  by 
Publication.  You must attach the Affidavit of Publisher.  The Affidavit of Publisher is a form the 
newspaper  will  prepare  and  send  to  you  after  it  completes  the  publishing.    File  the  Affidavit 
Following Service by Publication with the Court.  If the other party fails to respond by that time 
limit, you may follow the procedures for default as discussed in your other packet.

In all cases where service by publication can be made or where a statute permits service 
outside  this  state,  the  plaintiff/petitioner  may  obtain  service  by  registered  or  certified  mail.  
Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4(l) provides that “(u)pon the request of any party the 
Clerk shall send by registered or certified mail a copy of the complaint and summons addressed 
to the party to be served at the address given in the affidavit required under  Rule 4(f)”.  The mail 
shall be sent marked “Restricted Delivery”, requesting a return receipt signed by the addressee 
or the addressee’s agent who has been specifically authorized in writing by a form acceptable to, 
and  deposited  with,  the  postal  authorities.    When  such  return  receipt  is  received  signed  by  the 
addressee  or  the  addressee’s  agent  the  Clerk  shall  file  the  same  and  enter  a  certificate  in  the 
cause showing the making of such service.  Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4(l).   

f  you  qualify  to  serve  the  Defendant/Respondent  by  Registered  Mail,  fill  out  the 
Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered Mail and take the original and two copies to the Clerk 
for  filing.    You  will  also  need  to  take  an  envelope  with  proper  postage  and  necessary  postal 
forms  for restricted delivery in  order to  mail  the complaint or modification petition, summons, 
and the Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered Mail to the Defendant/Respondent.   

 
Recap for Serving by Registered Mail: 

1.  Fill  out  an  Affidavit  to  Allow  Service  by  Registered  Mail  and  file  an  original  and  two 

copies with the Clerk 

2.  Take an envelope  with proper postage and proper postal forms to the Clerk so that the 
Clerk  can  mail  the  required  documents  to  the  Defendant/Respondent  by  registered  or 
certified mail marked “restricted delivery.” 

3.  Service has now been completed and you may proceed with the next step in your prior 

packet. 

.  Waiver of Fees.  If you financially qualify, you may ask the Judge to waive the costs 
of the filing fee and having the sheriff serve your spouse with the paperwork for your divorce or 
modification action by completing and filing an Affidavit of Indigency and Request for Waiver of 
Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith together with the Order on Request for Waiver of 
Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith.  The Judge will then make a determination about 
whether or not to grant your request.  Procedures and policies vary from court to court so there is 
no guarantee that the Judge will grant your request. 

Recap for Requesting a Waiver of Fees: 

1.  Fill  out  an  Affidavit  of  Indigency  and  Request  for  Waiver  of  Filing  Fees and  All  Fees Associated 

Therewith; 

2.  Fill out an Order on Request for Waiver of Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith; 
3.  File both the Affidavit and the Order with the Court; 
4.  The Judge will determine whether or not you will need to pay the filing fees and service fees in your 

divorce or modification action and will mail a copy of the Order to you.

3.  Motion Forms. 
There  are  several  remedies  that  are  available  in  divorce  and 
modification actions that are not included in the packets.  For example, requests for temporary 
relief  (such  as  temporary  custody)  are  unique  to  each  case  and  can  be  complex.    It  is 
recommended that you seek the assistance of an attorney to help you.  However, if you need to 
make  a  request  of  the  Court  (or  respond  to  a  request)  before  the  final  order  is  entered,  the 
following forms are contained in this Packet: 
 

 
 
 
 

 

Motion 
Response to Motion 
Order on Motion 
Order Requiring Financial Affidavits 

For  each  motion  you  wish  to  file,  you  must  complete  the  Motion  form  as  well  as  the 
Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  forms  that  are  contained  in  your  original 
packet.  All three (3) forms must be filed with the Clerk’s office.  The Request for Setting allows 
the court to hear about your motion and to make a ruling regarding your request.  It also tells the 
court what the hearing is for and the amount of time needed.  The Judge will fill in the hearing 
date and time and return the Order Setting Hearing to you.  If your file a motion asking the court 
to  order  the  other  party  to  file  a  Confidential  Financial  Affidavit,  you  do  not  need  to  file  a 
Request  for  Setting  or  the  Order  Setting  Hearing.    For  each  form  you  file,  you  must  give  the 
Clerk an addressed, stamped envelope for both you and the other party.

and the other party and submit the Order on Motion with your Motion.  The Judge will either fill 
out the rest, or make a ruling at the hearing, which you will need to put in the Order.  If you need 
the court to order the other party to fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit, complete and file 
the Order Requiring Completion of Financial Affidavits. 

esponding  to  a  Motion:    If  the  other  party  files  a  motion,  you  should  fill  out  a 
Response to Motion form and state your objections, if any, to the requested relief.  If you fail to 
respond  in  writing,  you  may  be  prevented  from  responding  at  the  hearing,  and  the  other  party 
may be given what he/she asked for in the motion.  Generally, your response must be filed and 
delivered to the other party within twenty (20) days from the date it was mailed or, if there is a 
hearing, three (3) days before the hearing date, whichever is sooner.  You should attach to your 
response, any documents or other evidence you wish the judge to consider.
