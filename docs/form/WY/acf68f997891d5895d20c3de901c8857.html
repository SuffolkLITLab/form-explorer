forms supplement the packet(s) you have already purchased or downloaded from the Court. Most 
likely you will only need to use these additional forms for one of the following areas:  
 

1.  Additional ways to serve a Defendant/Respondent – use if you are unable to serve 
the Defendant/Respondent by the Sheriff or if the Defendant/Respondent will not sign 
an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service; 

2.  Waiver  of  Fees  –  use  if  you  are  unable  to  pay  the  Court’s  filing  fees  and/or  the 

Sheriff’s service fees;  

3.  Motion  Forms  –  use  if  you  need  to  make  a  request  of  the  Court  (or  respond  to  a 

request) before the final order is entered;  

4.  Dismissal Forms – use if you would like to dismiss the action before a final order is

To use service by publication, you must show that you have made every effort to find the 
Defendant/Respondent’s address. Completely fill out a Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by 
Publication and a Notice of Publication. (DO NOT sign where the Clerk needs to sign.)   

The Motion and Affidavit to Allow Service by Publication says that service of Summons 
cannot be made in Wyoming. If the Defendant/Respondent lives in another state and you know 
their address, check the first box and enter the address. 

If you do not know the Defendant/Respondent’s address, check the second box. Also, be 
sure to check off each method you used to try to find the Defendant/Respondent’s address. Note 
that you will need to attach any returned letters you wrote to the Defendant/Respondent.

the Defendant/Respondent by publication, you need to talk to a lawyer.   

If  you  DO  NOT  KNOW  the  Defendant/Respondent’s  address  and  cannot  find  it  after  making  every 
effort, the affidavit must detail the efforts you made to obtain an address. 

If  you  DO  KNOW  the  Defendant/Respondent’s  address,  the  publication  must  include  the  address. 
Immediately after the first publication appears in the newspaper, bring a copy to the Clerk. The Clerk will 
mail a copy to  the Defendant/Respondent by registered or certified mail. [NOTE:   You must  give the 
Clerk an envelope for each Defendant/Respondent along with  proper postage. Before going to the 
Clerk, complete the registered or certified mail forms and mark them as “Restricted Delivery” with 
return receipt requested.]

2. Have at least five hundred (500) paying subscribers; and  
3. Have pages that are all at least ten (10) inches by twelve and one-half (12.5) inches.

Publisher. The newspaper will send you the Affidavit of Publisher after it completes publishing

The following form is needed for service by registered or certified mail:  

•  Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail 

 

If the Defendant/Respondent lives outside of Wyoming and you know their address, you 
may  serve  the  Defendant/Respondent  by  registered  or  certified  mail.  To  serve  a  person  by 
registered  or  certified  mail,  you  need  to  pay  a  fee  and  ask  the  Clerk  to  mail  the  Notice  to  the 
Defendant/Respondent. You need to have everything ready before going to the Clerk.  

  First, complete the Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail and make 

two copies.   

•  Second, fill out the Summons. The address in the Summons must match the address in 
the Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail. Remember that  you do not sign 
the Summons, the Clerk does. 

•  Third, prepare an envelope for the Clerk to send to each Defendant/Respondent. Make 
sure  you  have  the  correct  addresses  and  proper  postage  on  the  envelope.  Then  complete  the 
registered  or  certified  mail  forms  and  mark  them  as  “Restricted  Delivery”  with  return  receipt 
requested. 

•  Fourth, gather the document that you want to serve and make two copies. This should 

be the Petition or Motion, depending on what you are trying to do. 

•  Fifth, make sure you have an extra copy of everything for your records. 

ring all of the above materials to the Clerk, including Summons and the Petition/Motion. 
Pay the fee and the Clerk will mail the documents to the Defendant/Respondent. When the Clerk 
gets the signed mail receipt from the Defendant/Respondent, the Clerk will file the receipt and 
record that service is complete. See Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 4(l) and 4(r).

Recap for Serving by Registered or Certified Mail: 

1.  Fill out an Affidavit to Allow Service by Registered or Certified Mail and file an original 

and two copies with the Clerk. 

2.  Take an envelope with proper postage, and the registered or certified mail postal forms 
marked  “restricted delivery,”  to the  Clerk  so that the  Clerk can  mail  the documents  to 
the Defendant/Respondent. 

3.  Once  service  has  been  completed,  you  may  proceed  with  the  next  step  in  your  prior 

packet. 

Look at Rule 4(l) and (r) of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure for more details. 

.  Waiver of Fees.  If you are unable to pay the fees, you may ask the Judge to waive the 
costs  of  the  filing  and  service  fees  with  an  Affidavit  of  Indigency  and  Request  for  Waiver  of 
Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith, together with the Order on Request for Waiver of 
Filing  Fees  and  All  Fees  Associated  Therewith.  (You  cannot  waive  the  cost  of  the  newspaper 
publication  fee.)    The  Judge  will  then  decide  whether  or  not  to  grant  your  request.  Procedures 
and policies vary from court to court so there is no guarantee that you will not have to pay fees. 

Recap for Requesting a Waiver of Fees: 

1.  Fill  out  an  Affidavit  of  Indigency  and  Request  for  Waiver  of  Filing  Fees and  All  Fees Associated 

Therewith; 

2.  Fill out an Order on Request for Waiver of Filing Fees and All Fees Associated Therewith; 
3.  File both the Affidavit and the Order with the Court; 
4.  The Judge will determine whether or not you will need to pay the filing fees and service fees in your 

action and will mail a copy of the Order to you. 

3.  Motion Forms. 
It is recommended that you ask an attorney for help.  However, if 
you need to make a request of the Court (or respond to a request) before the Court enters its final 
order, this packet contains the following forms to help you: 
 

• 
• 
• 

 

Motion 
Response to Motion 
Order on Motion 

For  each  motion  you  wish  to  file,  you  must  complete  the  Motion  form  as  well  as  the 
Request for Setting and Order Setting Hearing forms that are in your original packet. You must 
file all three (3) forms with the Clerk’s office. The Request for Setting allows the court to hear 
about  your motion  and to  decide whether to  grant  your request.  It  also  tells  the court what  the 
hearing is for and the amount of time needed. The Judge will fill in the hearing date and time and 
return  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  to  you.  For  each  form  you  file,  you  must  give  the  Clerk  an 
addressed, stamped envelope for both you and the other party.

and the other party. Then submit the Order on Motion with your Motion. The Judge will either

Order for the Judge to sign. 

esponding  to  a  Motion:    If  the  other  party  files  a  motion,  you  should  fill  out  a 
Response to Motion form and state your objections, if any, to the other party’s request. If you fail 
to respond in writing, you may not be allowed to respond at the hearing and the other party may 
be given what they asked for in the motion. Generally, you must file your Response and deliver it 
to  the  other  party  by  the  earlier  of  two  dates:  1)  within  twenty  (20)  days  from  the  date  it  was 
mailed to you; or 2) if there is a hearing, at least three (3) days before the hearing date. If there 
are any documents or other evidence you wish the judge to consider, attach it to your Response. 

   
Attend  Hearing:    Attend  the  hearing  scheduled  by  the  Court.  It  is  important  that  you 

show up on time and that you dress appropriately.

4.  Attend the hearing set by the Court. 

.  Dismissal  Forms.  If  you  would  like  to  dismiss  the  pending  action  for  any  reason 
(such  as  you  were  unable  to  serve  the  other  party,  or  for  any  other  reason  you  decide  you  no 
longer wish to proceed with the Petition or Motion), you will need the following forms: 
 

i. 
ii. 

Motion to Dismiss Action 
Order of Dismissal 

Complete  the  Motion  to  Dismiss  Action.  If  the  Defendant/Respondent  has  not  filed  an 
Answer  or  Response  to  your  Petition  or  Motion,  only  the  Petitioner/Movant  needs  to  sign  the 
Motion to Dismiss Action. If the Defendant/Respondent filed an Answer or Response, however, 
both parties will need to sign the Motion to Dismiss Action. Be sure to mark the correct box to 
request that the Court dismisses the action that applies to your case.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
