of at least one (1) of the children, a “shared responsibility child support” obligation for all of the children shall 
be determined by use of the tables.  See Wyo. Stat. §20-2-304(c) and (d).  For assistance in calculating child

pursuant  to  Wyo.  Stat.  §20-2-201  through  §20-2-204  and  §20-2-311(d).  
Wyoming  law  states  that  any  payment  of  child  support  not  paid  when  due  shall 
automatically  become  a  judgment  against  the  parent  who  is  supposed  to  pay  on 
the due date.  This judgment is subject to a 10% late payment penalty if it is not 
paid within thirty-two (32) days. Wyoming Statute §1-16-103(b) also states that if 
child  support  becomes  delinquent  in  an  amount  equal  to  or  greater  than  one 
month’s  obligation,  a  notice  may  issue  to  employers  and  others  who  may  owe 
money to the obligated parent; a percentage of the non-custodial parent’s income 
(35% minimum and up to 65% in some cases) of the obligated parent’s wages and 
other  income  could  be  withheld  and  submitted  to  the  Clerk  of  this  Court  to  be 
applied toward child support obligations. 

MEDICAL INSURANCE:   

The 

  Petitioner  OR 

  Respondent  OR

9.A.  Proof.   The insuring parent shall provide to the Court and the other parent 
written proof that the insurance has been obtained within sixty (60) days 
after it became available.  Proof of insurance coverage shall contain, at a

denied,  revoked,  or  altered  in  any  way  that  would  affect  the  child's 
coverage, including any change relating to the information required above. 
 

9.C.  Failure To Provide Insurance. The Court may hold an obligated parent in 
contempt  for  refusing  to  provide  the  ordered  insurance  or  for  failing  or 
refusing to provide the information required above.  In addition, if either 
parent fails to provide insurance or proof of insurance as required by this 
agreement, the other parent may provide such insurance and the obligated 
parent shall be liable to the other parent for the cost of such insurance plus 
the costs incurred in collection, including reasonable attorney’s fees. 

9.D.  Costs  Not  Paid  For  By  Insurance.  The  parents  are  jointly  liable  to 
providers  for  all  health  care  expenses  (including,  but  not  limited  to, 
medical,  dental,  orthodontic,  optical,  prescription  drugs,  counseling,  and 
all  other  health  care  expenses)  of  the  child(ren).    All  deductibles,  co-
payments and other expenses for health care that are not paid for by health 
insurance shall be paid by the parents as follows: 
 

i) 

ii) 

 50% each by Petitioner and Respondent; OR 
% by Petitioner and  
  

 

% by Respondent. 

 
If the insuring parent fails to pay the insurance premium, all health 
care expenses of the children not covered by insurance shall be the 
responsibility of that party.   
 
If  the  insuring  parent  fails  to  maintain  insurance  as  required,  that 
party may be found in contempt of Court and  may be required to 
pay  or  reimburse  the  expenses  and  costs  set  forth  in  Wyo.  Stat. 
§20-2-401(e). 

CHANGES IN ADDRESS AND EMPLOYMENT:   

Each parent shall inform the other parent and the clerk of court in writing of any 

change of address, phone number, and employment: 

10.A.  CHANGE  OF  EMPLOYMENT  STATUS:    So  long  as  there  is  a  child 
support obligation, each parent shall notify the other parent and the Clerk of this 
Court, in writing, on forms available from the Court, within fifteen (15) days of 
any change in employment, including second jobs, changed employers, starting or 
ending  unemployment  compensation,  and  starting  or  ending  of  worker’s 
compensation, or any other change in income.

Either party or, when appropriate, the department of family services has the right 

to  petition  to  enforce  an  order  pursuant  to  Wyo.  Stat.  §20-2-201  through  20-2-204, 

20-2-310 and 20-2-311(d). 

Contempt  -    Pursuant  to  Wyo.  Stat.  §20-2-204  and  20-2-310,  a  court 
having jurisdiction to enforce or revise the decree or order may, upon 
appropriate  motion  of  either  parent,  require  a  parent  to  appear 
before  the  court  and  show  just  cause  why  the  parent  should  not  be 
held  in  contempt,  upon  a  showing  that  the  parent  has  willfully 
violated  the  decree  or  order  as  to  the  care,  custody,  visitation  and 
maintenance  of  the  children.    The  court  may,  in  addition  to  any 
assessment  it  may  impose  upon  a  finding  that  the  parent  is  in 
contempt  of  court,  award  attorney's  fees,  costs,  and  such  other  and 
further  relief  as  the  court  may  deem  necessary  under  the 
circumstances,  to the parent aggrieved by the violation of the decree 
or order, in order to enforce and require future compliance with the 
decree or order.
