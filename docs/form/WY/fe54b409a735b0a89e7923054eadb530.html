File the Petition.   In  order  to  advise  the  Court  that  you  wish  to  establish

custody, visitation, and child support, you must file the Petition to Establish Custody, Visitation, 
and Child Support (“Petition”).  If you are filing the Petition, you are the “Petitioner.”  The other 
party will be referred to as the “Respondent.”  

Notarizing  Signatures.    Some  forms  will  require  you  to  have  your  signature  notarized.    Notarial 
Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, or in many cases, Clerks of Court will be 
willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each Clerk’s office has their own policy so check with them 
first before seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.   

here to file. You will file your case in the District Court in the county where either you 
or the Respondent resides. The Petition is given to the Clerk of the District Court, whose office 
is usually located in the county courthouse or a branch of the county courthouse.  A list of the 
Clerks  of  District  Court  for  each  Judicial  District  is  included  in  the  packet.    A  filing  fee  is 
required.    Ask  the  Clerk  what  the  amount  of  the  filing  fee  is  and  what  forms  of  payment  are 
accepted.  

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.”  The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and petition stating the name of 
the Petitioner, the Respondent, the District Court the case is filed in, and the case number. 

Other forms to file with the Petition. 

 

A.  When  you  file  the  Petition,  you  will  also  need  to  file  the  Civil  Cover  Sheet.  

Follow the instructions that accompany that document. 

. 

You will also need to fill out and file a Confidential Statement of the Parties for 
Child Support Order.  This  form provides the Court with  personal  information  (such as social 
security numbers and birth dates) of the parties involved in your case as required by  Wyoming 
law.    This  information  will  be  in  a  confidential  file  so  that  the  general  public  does  not  have 
access to the information.   

You will also need to have the Clerk sign (a/k/a “issue”) the Summons. 

How many copies.   Take  the  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  each  document  to  the 
Clerk’s office.  The Clerk will give you copies of each document back after stamping them with 
the  date  they  were  filed.    This  is  called  a  “file  stamp.”    You  should  keep  one  copy  of  each 
document  for  your  records.    The  other  set  of  documents  will  need  to  be  served  upon  the 
Respondent.

Summary  of  Step  2:    To  start  your  case,  you  will  need  to  file  the  following  documents  with  the  Clerk  of  the 
District Court’s office located in the county courthouse in the county where either you or the Respondent resides: 

A.  Civil Cover Sheet 

a.  Follow the instructions that accompany this form for help completing it correctly. 

B.  Petition to Establish Custody, Visitation, and Child Support  
C.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order; and 
D.   Summons  
E.  Pay the filing fee 
F.  Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.   
a.  The Clerk will give you both copies back after file-stamping them  
b.  You should keep one copy for your records.  
c.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Respondent (Step 3). 

tep 3. 

Serve the Respondent.  Once the Petition and Confidential Statement of 
the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  are  filed,  a  file-stamped  copy  must  be  formally  given  to 
(a/k/a  served  on) the Respondent.   Personal  service of the Petition,  Confidential  Statement  of 
the  Parties  and  Summons  on  the  Respondent  by  a  Sheriff  is  required  unless  the  Respondent 
completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form.  Formal service is required for 
the Petition and the Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order, so the Court 
has proof that the other party actually received the paperwork.  Other forms of service exist, but 
these  are  the  easiest  methods  that  meet  the  formal  service  requirement  for  a  Petition.    If  you 
cannot serve the Respondent by either of these methods, ask the Clerk for additional forms for 
other ways to obtain service. 
 

You  MUST  give  the  Respondent  official  notice  that  you  have  filed  a  Petition  and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order within 90 days from the date you 
filed them.  This is done by serving a copy of the  Summons, the Petition, and the Confidential 
Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  upon  the  Respondent  or  by  having  the 
Respondent sign an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form stating that copies of those 
documents were received.  If you do not serve the Respondent within 90 days, your case can be 
dismissed by the Court. 

How to Serve the Respondent.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to 

serve the Respondent: 

Option 1– Service by Sheriff  
 

. 

  A

 

Summons.  It is recommended to have a sheriff in the county where the Respondent can 
be  found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 
($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).   You can contact the Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the  Respondent  lives  to  determine  the  fee  charged  by  the  Sheriff.    This  is  also  true  if  the 
Respondent is going to be served out of state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff with a file-
stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Petition  and  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child 
Support Order to be served on the Respondent.

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called 
the “Return” (or they may have their own form – an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the  original  with  the  Clerk’s  office  and  send  you  a  copy.    If  you  receive  what  looks  like  the 
original “Return” or “Affidavit of Service” from the Sheriff, call the Clerk’s office to ensure the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the Respondent was given proper notice; 
 

Note:  Once the Respondent has been served, you MUST file the original Summons and 
original Return (or Affidavit of Service) with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows 
that proper service was made. 

ption 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.  If the Respondent agrees, he or she 
may  sign  a  form  stating  that  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Petition  and  Confidential 
Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order were received.  If the Respondent agrees, you 
will need to fill out an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form.  The Respondent must 
sign this document in front of a Notarial Officer.  

Proof of Service.  Once the Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form is signed, 
take  the  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  signed  form  to  the  Clerk’s  office  for  filing.    You 
should keep one copy for your records and provide the other copy to the Respondent. 
 

Note:  You must file the signed Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the 
original Summons with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper service on 
the Respondent was made.  
 

RECAP for Step 3:  You MUST give the Respondent official notice that you have filed a Petition within 90 days 
from the date you filed the Petition.  Choose one of the following methods: 

Option 1 – Service by Sheriff 

A.  Provide copy of the Summons, Petition and Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child 

Support Order to Sheriff where the Respondent lives; 

B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once  the  Respondent  is  served,  be  sure  the  original  Summons  and  the  original  Return  or 

Affidavit of Service are filed with the Clerk’s office; OR 

Option 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 

A.  Provide a copy of the Summons, Petition and Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child 

Support Order to the Respondent; 

B.  Have the Respondent sign the Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form in front of a 

C.  File the original Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the original Summons

Step 4.  Wait for the Respondent’s time to respond to expire.  Once 
the Respondent is served, he or she has 20 days (if served in the State of Wyoming or 30 days if 
served out-of-state) to file a Response to the Petition.  You must wait for the appropriate time 
period to expire before you can proceed with the case.  You must wait the 20 days (or 30 days if 
served  out-of-state)  even  if  the  Respondent  tells  you  that  he  or  she  is  not  going  to  file  a 
Response.  

  Computation  of  Time  Limits.  In  computing  most  time  limits,  unless  otherwise 
stated, the day the document is served shall not be included. The last day of the time 
period is included, unless it lands on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, if 
the  Courthouse  is  closed  then  the  time  limit  will  be  on  the  very  next  day  that  the 
Courthouse is open.   If you have questions about time limits you should seek the 
advice of an attorney. 
 

•  While waiting, move on to Step 5.  You can also use this time to continue to work on 

the other required forms to be sure they are filled out completely and correctly. 
 

RECAP  for  Step  4:    You  MUST  wait  for  the  Respondent’s  time  to  file  a  Response  to  expire  before  you  can 
proceed with your case.  In the meantime: 

A. 
B. 
C. 

Mark on the calendar when the time to file a Response expires; 
Move on to Step 5 while waiting; and 
Use this time to ensure the required forms are filled out completely and correctly. 

tep  5.              Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Respondent’s Response is required to 
be  served  on  the  Petitioner  (use  the  table  in  5.A.  below  to  determine  date),  which  includes  a 
summary of the facts believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child 
custody is at issue.    

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

A.  WHEN TO PROVIDE:  Initial Disclosures must be provided to the Respondent 
(or his/her attorney) WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER THE RESPONDENT’S RESPONSE IS 
REQUIRED TO BE SERVED ON YOU (use table below).  Be sure to keep a copy of 
your  Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the 
date  when  you  and  the  Respondent  are  required  to  provide  initial  disclosures  to  one 
another.

Option A. The following instructions apply if the Respondent filed a 
Response,  or Response  and Counterclaim, and you both agree on all 
of the issues of your case.  If you and the Respondent agree on the issues involved in 
your case, then you will need to complete the following: 
 

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit including the 
required  attachments  with  the  Court.    If  the  Respondent  does  NOT  file  a 
Confidential  Financial  Affidavit,  you  will  need  to  complete  an  Affidavit  of 
Imputed  Income  to  show  the  Court  how  much  money  the  Respondent  makes.  
This is an additional form contained in your packet. 
 

•  Required  Attachments.    The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  of  the  parties 
must be supported with documentation of both current and past earnings. Proper 
documentation  of  current  earnings  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  pay  stubs, 
employer  statements,  or  receipts  and  expenses  if  self-employed.  Documentation 
of  current  earnings  shall  be  supplemented  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  tax 
return to provide verification of earnings over a longer period. Include copies of 
income tax returns for the previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to 
show how much you have made so far this year.  
 
Fill  out  an  Affidavit  for  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation  and  Child 
Support Without Appearance of Parties.  This form provides the admissible evidence the Court 
needs to enter an Order without requiring the parties to attend a hearing.  

B. 

. 

Fill out an Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support (“Order”).  
This form will need to be filled out completely, signed by both you and the Respondent and both 
of  your  signatures  notarized.    In  addition  to  signing  the  Order,  you  should  also  initial  each 
page of the Order to verify that each page contains the terms you agreed upon. 

ere are some important laws and helpful hints in completing the Order:

•  Custody  and  Visitation.    You  and  the  Respondent  need  to  determine  which 
custody and visitation plan will apply in your circumstances.  It is unusual for the 
Court  not  to  award  any  visitation  or  supervised  visitation  to  the  non-custodial 
parent.  
 

o 

 If  there  is  a  concern  that  your  child(ren)  may  be  harmed  by  the  other 
parent  physically  and/or  emotionally,  you  should  seek  advice  from 
someone  familiar  with  parenting  and  child  development  issues.    There 
may  be  an  organization  in  your  community  that  can  help  facilitate 
visitation between the children and you or the other parent.   You can also

contact  the  facilitators  of  any  parenting  classes  in  your  community  for 
other ideas.   

•  Factors  to  be  considered  for  awarding  custody  and  visitation.    The  Order 
contains  several  options  for  custody  and  visitation  arrangements.    Ideally,  both 
parents  will  work  together  to  select  the  proper  custody  and  visitation  plan 
depending upon the family circumstances.   In awarding custody and setting forth 
a  visitation  plan,  Wyoming  law  requires  that  the  Court  consider  the  following 
factors: 

The geographic location of each parent; 
Each  parent's  willingness  and  ability  to  perform  the  child  care 
duties  associated  with  the  child(ren),  relative  to  the  child(ren)'s 
stage of development such as feeding, changing, bathing, preparing 
the  child(ren)  for  school,  taking  responsibility  for  the  child(ren)'s 
homework, etc.; 
Each parent's ability to care for the child(ren)'s needs (consider not 
only historical involvement but a parent's willingness and ability to 
learn the necessary skills, as well); 
The lack of hostility between the parents; 
The  ability  of  both  parents'  work  schedules  and  the  child(ren)'s 
schedule to accommodate extended access; 
The child(ren)'s age(s) and strength of attachment to each parent; 
The child(ren)'s relationship with his/her friends. 
 

•  Child(ren)’s  interests  should  control.    The  use  of  a  calendar  for  scheduling 
purposes  is  highly  recommended.    The  parents'  work  schedules  and  the 
child(ren)'s  school  and  extracurricular  activities  need  to  be  considered  when 
developing a visitation plan.  This is especially true for those parents who do not 
enjoy  a  traditional  work  week.    While  visitation  should  be  an  enjoyable  and 
enriching experience, it is an obligation and responsibility for each parent as well 
as a right and a privilege.  Both parents must also have a good faith commitment 
to developing and carrying out a visitation plan.  You need to focus on what type 
of schedule would be in the child(ren)’s best interest.    

•  Parenting  classes.  At  any  time  the  Court  may  require  parents  to  attend 
appropriate  parenting  classes,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  parenting  classes  to 
lessen  the  effects  of  custody  battles  on  children.    Both  parents  are  generally 
required  to  attend  classes  when  they  are  ordered.    If  the  class  is  ordered,  you 
MUST file a Certificate of Completion with the Clerk’s office.  This certificate is 
provided by the class instructor. 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Respondent completed (or by the Affidavit of Imputed Income if the Respondent 
did not complete his/her own Confidential Financial Affidavit).  You may use the

Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to  help  you  calculate  the  support 
due  or  contact  your  local  child  support  enforcement  agency  for  assistance.    
Another option is to go online to:

➢  You  CANNOT  agree  that  no  support  will  be  paid.    Wyoming  law 
allows for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical 
custody, each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of the year, and both parents contribute substantially to 
the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   

  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include the specific reasons for deviation in the Order.  

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  TITLE  19,  KID  CARE,  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the net income of you and the Respondent even if you 
and the Respondent agree to a lower amount of support. 

  ➢

 

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support,  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 
child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to pay for 

 

 

  E

stablishment of Custody, Visitation, and Child Support - Information and Instructions 

Revised September 2019 
Page 9 of 15 
 

expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for 
which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Petitioner  and  50%  to 
Respondent). 

 

D. 

Fill  out  an  Order  for  Income  Withholding.   The  Court  is  required  by  statute  to 

enter an Order for Income Withholding in every case where child support has been ordered.   

E. 

 
Fill out an Income Withholding for Support.  This form is required if you need to 
have  the  child  support  paid  directly  from  a  non-custodial  parent’s  employer.    If  you  need 
assistance  in  filling  out  this  form,  or  if  you  need  assistance  in  collecting  child  support,  you 
should contact the child support enforcement agency in your district.  The Clerk can provide you 
with the agency’s contact information. 

Other Forms:  Other forms may be required depending on the county where your 

case is filed.  Ask the Clerk if additional forms are required. 

. 

Copies and Envelopes.  Take an original and two (2) copies of each of the above 
documents for filing with the Clerk and two (2) addressed, stamped envelopes (one addressed to 
you and one to  the  Respondent with  enough postage to  cover the cost  of  mailing the  Order to 
you and the Respondent).   A copy of any documents that you file (other than the Order) must be 
sent  to  the  Respondent  on  the  date  that  you  filled  out  on  the  Certificate  of  Service  on  each 
document.   
 

➢  If  a  hearing  is  not  required  by  your  Court,  the  Clerk  will  mail  a  copy  of  your 

Order if accepted by the Court.  
 

➢   If a hearing is required by your Court, follow the next steps: 

. 

Hearing.    In  some  Courts,  a  hearing  is  required  before  the  Judge  will  sign  the 
Order.    If  this  is  the  case,  you  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  the  Request  for 
Setting.    If  you  have  reached  an  agreement,  check  the  box  that  states  that  the  parties  have 
reached  an  agreement.    Indicate  how  much  time  you  will  need  for  the  hearing  (usually  15 
minutes  if  there  is  an  agreement).    You  will  file  the  Order  Setting  Hearing  with  the  Clerk’s 
office  and  the  Court  will  fill  in  the  hearing  date  and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the 
Respondent.  You  will  need  to  provide  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the 
Respondent  to  the  Clerk.    These  documents  are  additional  forms  that  are  contained  in  your 
packet. 

. 

Evidence.  At the hearing, you will need to inform the Judge about your situation 
and what you are asking him or her to do.  You will also need to give the proposed Order to the 
Judge.  The Judge may ask you questions.  The Judge will not guide you through the hearing, tell 
you how to proceed or advise you on the law.  Following the hearing, the Judge may advise you 
whether or not changes need to be made to the proposed Order by you or the other party or the 
Judge may make his or her own revisions to the Order.

When  will  your  order  become  final?    Your  Order  will  not  be  final  until  the 
Judge  approves  it  and  it  is  filed  with  the  Clerk.    This  process  may  take  time  if  changes  to  the

Respondent).    
▪  Attend the Hearing 

 

Your order is final when the Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support has been signed by the 
Judge and filed by the Clerk. 

ption B. If  the  Respondent  does  not  file  a  Response  or  Response

A. 

 Default  Order.  After the required waiting period has expired,  you may obtain 
what  is  referred  to  as  an  order  by  default  if  the  Respondent  does  NOT  file  a  Response  or 
Response and Counterclaim to the Petition to Establish Custody, Visitation, and Child Support.

D. 

Default  Hearing.    Some  Courts  will  not  enter  a  Default  Order  Establishing 
Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child  Support  unless  there  is  a  hearing.    Ask  the  Clerk  if  this  is 
required for  your Court.  If it is, fill out a Request for Setting and request 15 minutes for the 
hearing.  You will file the Order Setting Hearing with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill

provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Respondent to the Clerk. 

E. 

Evidence.  At the hearing, you will need to inform the Judge about your situation 
and what you are asking him or her to do.  You will also need to give the proposed Order to the 
Judge.  The Judge may ask you questions.  The Judge will not guide you through the hearing, tell 
you how to proceed or advise you on the law.  Following the hearing, the Judge will make any 
necessary changes to the Order and will sign it. 

F.  When  will  your  Order  become  final?    Your  order  will  not  be  final  until  the 
Judge signs the Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support and it is filed with the 
Clerk.   This  process  may take time if the Judge requires  changes to  the  proposed  Order.   You 
must  verify  with  the  Clerk  that  the  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child  Support 
has  been  file-stamped  before  you  can  be  sure  your  order  is  final.    The  time  limit  to  appeal  an

9.  Complete and file any additional documents required by your Court. 
10.  If  your  Court  requires  a  hearing  before  entering  an  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation,  and 

Child Support, then, you will also need to file and do the following: 

•  Request for Setting  
•  Order Setting Hearing  
•  Take an original and two (2) copies of the Order Setting Hearing for filing with the Clerk 
and  two  (2)  addressed,  stamped  envelopes  (one  addressed  to  you  and  one  to  the

•  Attend the Hearing 

 

Your order is final when the Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support has been signed by 
the Judge and filed by the Clerk. 

ption C. If  the  Respondent  Files  a  Response  or  Response  and 
Counterclaim,  and  you  and  the  Respondent  do  NOT  agree  on  all 
issues of your case, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

You  must  file  a  Reply  to  the  Counterclaim.    If  the  Respondent  has  filed  a 
Response  and  Counterclaim  for  custody,  you  will  have  a  time  limit  (usually  20  days)  to  file  a 
written response (Reply to Counterclaim) to the counterclaim.  The original signed copy of your 
reply  must  be  filed  with  the  Clerk  and  a  copy  must  be  sent  to  the  Respondent  (or  his/her 
attorney).   

  O

•  Caution:  If you do not file the original Reply to Counterclaim with the Clerk 
within the time allowed, the Respondent can seek a default order against you 
and may get what he/she asked for in his/her counterclaim. 

B. 
Judge at a trial.   

Trial.  If there is no agreement, your case will have to be heard and decided by a 

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

C. 

Request  a  trial  date.    You  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  a 
Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  Indicate how much time 
you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your  evidence  and  write  that  in 
(usually  one (1) to three (3) hours).   You also need to decide whether or not  you want a court 
reporter  to  record  the  proceeding.  SEE  BELOW  FOR  DETAILS  ON  GETTING  A  COURT 
REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a transcript of the hearing 
will not be available.   It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not get a court 
reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Trial  and  Requesting 
Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date

and  time  and  mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the  other  party.    You  will  need  to  provide  an 
addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the  Respondent  to  the  Clerk.    Both  the 
Request for Setting and the Order Setting Trial and Requiring Pretrial Statements are 
additional forms contained in your packet. 

D. 

Pretrial  Disclosures.    Both  parties  must  provide  to  the  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.  
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Respondent (or his/her attorney). 

 

 

E. 

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must  present  the  Court  with  the  completed  and  signed  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation, 
and  Child  Support  before  the  Court  will  take  the  trial  off  of  the  schedule.  There  will  be  no 
continuances or canceling of the trial date based on telephone calls.  If you need a continuance, 
you should contact an attorney for assistance in seeking one.  

.       Court Reporter.  If you wish to have a court reporter, you shall provide notice to 
the appropriate official court reporter  as  soon as  possible, but  no later than  three (3)  working 
days before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the court reporter by phone 
or  by  submitting  a  written  request.    Please  note  that  if  providing  notice  through  the  mail,  the 
request  must  be  received  by  the  court  reporter  no  later  than  three  working  days  prior  to  the 
hearing.    The  clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day 
notice requirement will not be waived by the Court.  The notice is required for all civil matters 
including jury trials.  

. 

 Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered (signed 
by the Judge), you must follow the terms and provide the Court with the information requested in 
that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a list of your 
proposed witnesses and what their testimony is going to be about within the time frame ordered 
(usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you or assist you at 
trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 
 

H. 

Final  Decision  (Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation,  and  Child  Support).  
Following  the  trial,  the  Judge  will  make  a  decision  or  may  take  the  matter  under  advisement, 
meaning  he  or  she  will  need  to  think  further  before  making  a  determination.    If  the  Judge 
instructs  you,  you  must  take  that  decision  and  type  it  into  the  Order  Establishing  Custody, 
Visitation, and Child Support incorporating the Judge’s decision.

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.   The Judge will not 
guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on 
the law. 

➢  You MUST also file the documents outlined in Step 6, Option A, items A and 

C through G above. 

I. 

When  will  your  order  become  final?    Your  order  will  not  be  final  until  the 
Judge signs the Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child Support and it is filed with the 
Clerk of Court.  This process may take time if the Judge requires changes to the proposed Order.     
You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk’s  office  that  the  Order  Establishing  Custody,  Visitation,  and 
Child Support has been file-stamped before you can be sure your order is final.  The time limit to 
appeal an order begins to run from the day the Order Establishing Custody, Visitation, and Child 
Support is filed with the Clerk’s office.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
