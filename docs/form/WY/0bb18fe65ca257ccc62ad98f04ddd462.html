      <pre>FAMILY LAW INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 
 
CONFIDENTIALITY:   If  you have concerns about keeping information confidential, such as 
your address and/or social security number, please consult an attorney.  You should also know 
that Domestic Violence Protection Orders or Stalking Orders are available free of charge at the 
circuit  court  clerks’  offices.    You  may  request  assistance  in  obtaining  Domestic  Violence 
Protection  or  Stalking  Orders  from  your  local  domestic  violence  or  sexual  assault  program  or 
you may call the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault (1-307-755-
0992).  There are also private attorneys who may be willing to assist clients in these matters.   If 
you  have  ever  obtained  a  Protection  Order  against  the  other  party,  this  information  should  be 
indicated in the Complaint for Divorce or the Counterclaim.    

ead  through  the  following  information  and  instructions  before  completing  the  forms.  
You must fill out all forms as completely as possible.  If  your forms are not complete, the 
Judge may reject your packet.   

  divorce  action  starts  with  the  filing  of  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    A  Complaint  for 
Divorce is a written request to the court for a divorce.  The person who originally asks for this 
legal  action is  called the  Plaintiff and remains  the  Plaintiff throughout  the case.   The  Plaintiff 
will file the Complaint for Divorce with the Clerk of the District Court, whose office is usually 
located  in  the  county  courthouse  or  a  branch  of  the  county  courthouse.    A  case  number,  also 
called  a  civil  action  number,  is  assigned  and  an  official  court  file  is  opened.    Delivering  the 
Complaint for Divorce to the Clerk’s office is called filing a case.   

Case Number:  When you start a lawsuit by filing the paperwork with the Clerk of the District Court, a 
case number will be assigned by the Clerk.  You must include that case number on all further paperwork 
in the “caption.”  The caption is the top section of a pleading, motion, and complaint stating the name of 
the Plaintiff, Defendant, the District Court the case is filed in and the case number. 

  A

 

     

nformation:   

Once  a  case  has  been  filed,  a  copy  must  be  formally  given  to  (a/k/a  served  on)  the 
Defendant.   The person  against whom the original  legal  action is  being requested is  called the 
Defendant,  and  he  or  she  is  expected  to  answer  the  Complaint  for  Divorce.    The  Defendant 
remains the Defendant throughout the case.  Personal service of the Complaint for Divorce and 
Summons  on  the  Defendant  by  a  Sheriff  is  required  for  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  unless  the 
defendant completes an  Acknowledgment  and Acceptance of Service form.   Formal  service is 
required  for  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  so  the  Court  has  proof  that  the  Defendant  actually 
received the papers.  Other forms of service exist, but these are the easiest methods that meet the 
formal service requirement for a Complaint for Divorce.

wo options exist – you may either Answer the Complaint for Divorce or file an Answer and 

Counterclaim.  Both options are explained below: 
 

PTION A.  Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce.      If  you  have  been  served  or  have 
signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form,  you  should  file  an  Answer  to 
Complaint  for  Divorce  with  the  Clerk  of  District  Court  where  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  was 
filed.    An  Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce  is  a  written  document  explaining  to  the  court 
exactly which provisions you agree with and which provisions you deny. If you fail to answer, a 
default judgment may be entered against you and your spouse may be entitled the relief he or she 
asked for in the Complaint for Divorce.  

  O

 

You must fill in the caption.  DO NOT forget to include the case number.  This is located in the 
caption of the Summons and/or Complaint for Divorce. 
  
 

i. 
Admit  or  Deny.    To  answer  the  papers,  you  should  go  through  each  and  every 
paragraph of the Complaint for Divorce and either “admit” or “deny” each paragraph.  If 
you do not have sufficient information to either admit or deny a particular allegation, you 
must state that in your Answer to Complaint for Divorce.  If you disagree with something 
and you fail to “deny” it in your Answer to Complaint for Divorce, the Judge can find that 
you admitted it. 
 
ii. 
Time  limit  to  answer.    You  have  only  a  limited  amount  of  time  to  file  an 
Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce.    Generally,  if  you  were  served  within  the  State  of 
Wyoming,  you  will  have  20  days  to  file  the  Answer  to  Complaint  for  Divorce.    If  you 
were  served  outside  the  State  of  Wyoming,  you  generally  will  have  30  days  to  file  an 
Answer to Complaint for Divorce.  If you do not file an Answer to Complaint for Divorce 
by  your  deadline,  then  your  spouse  may  obtain  a  Decree  of  Divorce  giving  him/her 
everything he/she requested in the Complaint for Divorce. 

iii. 
Computation of Time Limits.  In computing most time limits, unless otherwise 
stated, the day the pleading is served shall not be included. The last day of the period so 
computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, when 
the  act  to  be  done  is  the  filing  of  a  paper,  a  day  on  which  weather  or  other  conditions 
have made the office of the Clerk of the court inaccessible, in which event the period runs 
until  the  end  of  the  next  day  which  is  not  one  of  the  aforementioned  days.  When  the 
period  of  time  prescribed  or  allowed  is  less  than  11  days,  intermediate  Saturdays, 
Sundays,  and  legal  holidays  shall  be  excluded  in  the  computation.  A  "legal  holiday" 
includes any day officially recognized as a legal holiday in this state by designation of the 
legislature or appointment as a holiday by the governor.

NOTE:  If you have any question or concerns as to when the deadline to file the Answer to 
Complaint for Divorce is, you should consult an attorney. 
 

iv. 
Certificate  of  Service:    Copies  of  all  documents  sent  to  or  filed  with  the  court 
must  be  sent  to  the  Plaintiff  before  the  Judge  will  consider  them.    This  certificate  is 
included at the end of each document that requires it.   

Copies.  Make two (2) copies of the document.  The original will be filed by the 
. 
Clerk  of  District  Court,  one  copy  is  for  the  Plaintiff  and  the  other  copy  is  for  you  (the 
Defendant).  You will need to repeat this step for all documents you file with the Clerk’s 
office.   

OPTION B.  Answer  and  Counterclaim  for  Divorce.    If  you  want  the  Judge  to  grant 
relief to you (for example, give you the divorce, award property to you, order your spouse to pay 
alimony, take your previous last name back, etc.) you should file an Answer and Counterclaim 
for Divorce.  An Answer and Counterclaim for Divorce responds to the Complaint for Divorce 
and gives you an opportunity to tell the court what you want to happen with the divorce.  First, 
you will go through each and every paragraph of the Complaint for Divorce and either “admit” 
or “deny” each paragraph.  Second, the Counterclaim for Divorce portion of the document asks 
the Judge to give you what you want.  You must fill out all the information in the Answer and 
Counterclaim for Divorce completely. 
 

i 
Restoration of Wife’s previous name:  The Wife should state whether or not she 
would  like  to  resume  her  prior  name  in  either  the  Complaint  for  Divorce  if  she  is  the 
Plaintiff, or a Counterclaim if she is the Defendant.  This is the Wife’s choice ONLY; the 
Husband cannot demand that his Wife’s name be changed. 

i.   

Follow Step A(ii) through Step A(v) above. 

OTE:  If you have any question or concerns as to when the deadline to file the Answer and 

Counterclaim for Complaint for Divorce is, you should consult an attorney. 
 

iii. 

Plaintiff’s  Reply  to  Your  Counterclaim.    The  Plaintiff  must  reply  to  the 
Counterclaim.  If you file a Counterclaim, the Plaintiff will have 20 days to “reply” by filing a 
Reply to Counterclaim.  The Plaintiff will either admit or deny the separate allegations in  your 
Counterclaim.    If  the  Plaintiff  fails  to  reply  to  the  Counterclaim,  you  may  be  entitled  to  file 
Default paperwork seeking the relief you request in your Counterclaim. The Default paperwork 
is contained in a separate packet available on the self-help website or from the Clerk of District 
Court’s office.

  a

_____________________________ 
      

2.  Next, determine when you are required to file an Answer: 

A.  WHEN TO PROVIDE:  Initial Disclosures must be provided to the Plaintiff (or 
his/her attorney) WITHIN 30 DAYS  AFTER YOUR  ANSWER  IS  REQUIRED TO BE 
SERVED  ON  THE  PLAINTIFF  (use  table  below).    Be  sure  to  keep  a  copy  of  your 
Initial  Disclosures  form  for  your  records.    Use  the  following  to  determine  the  date 
when you and the Plaintiff are required to provide initial disclosures to one another.     
 

1.  Begin  with 

the  date  you  were 

served  with 

the  Complaint: 

b.  If  you  signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service,  add  20 

days to the date in #1:  ___________________________ 

c.  If you were served out-of-state, add 30 days to the date in #1:  

OR 

 __________________________ 
 

3.  Add 30 days to the date in #2(a), (b), or (c):  ___________________________ 

he  date  set  forth  in  #3  is  the  date  by  which  you  and  the  Plaintiff  must  provide  your 

completed Initial Disclosures forms to one another. 
 
DO NOT FILE THE INITIAL DISCLOSURES WITH THE COURT.  This 

B. 
form is only given to the Plaintiff (or his/her attorney). 

  T

__________________________ 
OR 

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

STEP 2.  Initial  Disclosures.    The  law  requires  certain  information  be  made 
available to the other party within thirty (30) days after the Defendant’s Answer is required to be 
served on the Plaintiff (use the table in 2.A. below to determine date).  The information consists 
of  a  schedule  of  financial  assets;  schedule  of  non-financial  assets;  schedule  of  all  debts  owed 
individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information;  and 
information regarding other income and retirement accounts.   

TEP 3. 

If you and the Plaintiff agree on all of the terms in the Decree of Divorce, you will 
both need to sign the document in front of a Notarial Officer.  The Decree of Divorce will need 
to be filled out completely, signed by you and the Plaintiff and both of your signatures need to be 
notarized. In addition to signing the Decree, you should also initial each page of the Decree 
to verify that each page contains the terms you agreed upon.   

• 

When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge approves the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk of Court.  This process may

    S

take time if the Judge requires changes to the proposed Decree. You must verify with the Clerk’s 
office that the Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is 
final.  The time limit to appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed 
with the Clerk’s office.   

TEP 4.  If you and the Plaintiff do NOT agree on all issues of your 

divorce, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

Trial.  If you and the Plaintiff cannot agree on all issues, your case will have to be 

heard and decided by a Judge at a trial.   

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

B. 

Request a trial date.  If the Plaintiff has NOT done so, you will need to request a 
hearing by completing a Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  
Indicate  how  much  time  you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your 
evidence and write that in (usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether 
or not  you want  a Court reporter to record the proceeding.  SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS ON 
GETTING A COURT REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a 
transcript of the hearing will not be available.  It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if 
you do not get a Court reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   
 

➢  You  must  file  the  Request  for  Setting  and  the  Order  Setting  Divorce  Trial  and 
Requesting Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the 
hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the other party.  You will need to 
provide an addressed, stamped envelope for you and the Plaintiff to the Clerk.   

nce a trial date has been set, do the following: 

  O

 

C. 

Pretrial  Disclosures. 

  Both  parties  must  provide  to  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

 

  S

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.   
 

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Plaintiff (or his/her attorney). 

 

Settlement before trial.  In the event your case settles before the trial, you must 
present the Court with the completed and signed Decree of Divorce in writing before the Court 

 

  •

will take the trial off of the schedule. There will be no continuances or canceling of the trial date 
based  on  telephone  calls.    If  you  need  a  continuance,  you  should  contact  an  attorney  for 
assistance in seeking one.  

 

Court reporter.  If you wish to have a Court reporter you are required to provide 
notice to the official Court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days 
before the matter is set for hearing.  You can provide notice to the court reporter by phone or by 
submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the mail, the request 
must be received by the court reporter no later than three working days prior to the hearing.  The 
Clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day  notice 
requirement  will  not  be  waived  by  the  Court.    The  notice  is  required  for  all  civil  matters 
including jury trials.   
 

• 

Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and witnesses.  If the Order Setting Divorce Trial and Requesting Pretrial Statements is entered 
(signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the  information 
requested in that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the trial and a 
list  of  your proposed  witnesses and what  their testimony is  going to  be about  within the time 
frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot help you 
or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 

 

Final Decision (Decree of Divorce).  Following the trial, the Judge will make a 
decision or may take the matter under advisement, meaning he or she will need to think further 
before making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type 
it into the Decree of Divorce incorporating the Judge’s decision. 

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Judge will not 
guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on 
the law. 

• 

When will your divorce become final?  Your divorce will not be final until the 
Judge signs the Decree of Divorce and it is filed with the Clerk of Court.  This process may take 
time  if  the  Judge  requires  changes  to  the  proposed  Decree.    You  must  verify  with  the  Clerk’s 
office that the Decree of Divorce has been file-stamped before you can be sure your divorce is 
final.  The time limit to appeal a decree begins to run from the day the Decree of Divorce is filed 
with the Clerk’s office.

(one addressed to you and one to the  Plaintiff with enough postage to  cover the cost of 
mailing the Order Setting Divorce Trial and Requiring Pretrial Statements to you and the 
Plaintiff).    

c.  File your Pretrial Disclosures 30 days before the trial date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
