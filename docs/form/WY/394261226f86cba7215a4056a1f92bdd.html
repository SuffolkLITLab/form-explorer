      <pre>CUSTODY AND CHILD SUPPORT MODIFICATION 
 INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ONFIDENTIALITY:  If you have concerns about keeping information confidential,  such as 
your address and/or social security number, please consult an attorney.  You should also know 
that Domestic Violence Protection Orders or Stalking Orders are available free of charge at the 
circuit  court  clerks’  offices.    You  may  request  assistance  in  obtaining  Domestic  Violence 
Protection  or  Stalking  Orders  from  your  local  domestic  violence  or  sexual  assault  program  or 
you may call the Wyoming Coalition Against Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault  (844) 264-
8080 (toll free) or (307) 755-0992.  There are also private attorneys who may be willing to assist 
clients in these matters.   If  you have ever obtained a Protection Order against the other party, 
this  information  should  be  indicated  in  the  Petition  to  Modify  Custody  and  Support  or  the 
Counterclaim.   

ead  through  the  following  information  and  instructions  before  completing  the  forms  to 
ensure that you qualify to file for a modification of custody and child support in Wyoming. 
You must fill out all forms as completely as possible.  If  your forms are not complete, the 
Judge may reject your packet.   

his packet is to modify custody and child support.  If you wish to modify child support only, 

a separate packet is available.   
  
1. 

Qualifying for a modification of custody:  In order to modify/adjust your current 
custody  arrangement,  you  must  show  the  Court  that  there  has  been  a  material 
change in circumstances. 
  

a.  Material change in circumstances: A court may modify an order concerning the care, 
custody and visitation of the children if there is a showing by either parent of a material 
change in circumstances since the entry of the order in question and that the modification 
would  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  children  pursuant  to  Wyoming  law.  (Wyo.  Stat. 
§20-2-201(a)).  A  condition  which  existed  when  the  custody  order  was  entered  is  not  a 
material change of circumstances.  

b.  Burden  of  proof:    It  is  up  to  the  person  trying  to  modify  or  change  the  custody 
arrangement  of  the  earlier  order/decree  to  establish  that  a  material  change  in 
circumstances has occurred, following the entry of the previous order.  

c.  Judges have broad decision-making authority: Custody, visitation, child support, and 
alimony are all committed to the sound discretion of the district court. The welfare and 
needs of the children are to be given paramount consideration. The determination of the 
best interests of the child is a question for the Judge.  A Judge’s decision is very hard to 
overturn. 

Modifying  child  support:    Often  when  a  person  seeks  to  modify  child  custody,  child 
support  will  also  be  affected.    If  that  is  the  situation  in  your  case,  this  packet  includes 
information to modify child support too.

•  If  you  believe  there  has  been  a  material  change  in  circumstances  warranting  a 

change in custody, you may move forward with this packet.   

tep 1.  Getting Started.    If  you  qualify  to  file  for  a  modification  of  your  current 
custody  order,  the  following  forms  are  necessary  in  all  uncontested  modification  cases.    It  is 
recommended that you complete all of these forms before you file the Petition to Modify Custody 
and Support so that they will be ready to file at the appropriate time: 
 

1.  Petition  to  Modify  Custody  and  Support  (Attach  a  certified  copy  of  the  prior 

custody order) 

2.  Summons 
3.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order 
4.  Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service 
5.  Confidential Financial Affidavit (both parties must file a financial affidavit) 
6.  Order Modifying Custody and Support  
7.  Order for Income Withholding  
8.  Income Withholding for Support (or, you can also open up a case with your local 

child support enforcement agency and they will prepare this form for you) 
 

**Other  forms  may  be  required  depending  on  the  Court  and  on  your  situation.    If  additional 
forms are needed, they will be discussed below where applicable. 
***You will need to obtain a certified copy of  your prior order granting custody.  This can be 
obtained from the Clerk of District Court where the prior custody order was filed. 

emember,  your  packet  contains many  forms  that  will  not  be  required  in  all  situations.    Be 
sure to follow these instructions carefully to ensure you have completed the correct forms for 
your situation. 

tep 2. 

File the Petition.  In order to advise the Court that you wish to modify your 
current  custody  and  child  support  order,  you  must  file  the  Petition  to  Modify  Custody  and 
Support (“Petition”).  If you are filing the Petition, you are the “Petitioner” regardless of whether 
you  were  the  Plaintiff  or  the  Defendant  when  the  custody  and  child  support  order  was  first 
entered.  The other party will be referred to as the “Respondent.”   

Notarizing  Signatures.    Some  forms  will  require  you  to  have  your  signature  notarized.    Notarial 
Officers may administer the oath and witness your signature, or in many cases, Clerks of Court will be 
willing to administer the necessary oath.  Each Clerk’s office has their own policy so check with them 
first before seeking notarization of your signature on the forms.   

You will file the Petition with the Clerk of District Court where the original custody and 
child support order was issued. Ask the Clerk for your case number.  Delivering the Petition to 
the Clerk’s office is called filing a case.  A filing fee is required.  Ask the Clerk what the amount 
of  the  filing  fee  is  and  what  forms  of  payment  are  accepted.  You  will  also  need  to  attach  a

certified  copy  of  your  prior  custody  order  to  the  Petition.    The  Clerk  can  assist  you  with 
obtaining a certified copy.  There will be a charge for providing copies of your prior order.  You 
will  also  need  to  file  the  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  and 
have the Clerk issue the Summons. 

Case Number:  You will need to use the same case number assigned to the original custody and child 
support  order.    You  must  include  that  case  number  on  all  further  paperwork  in  the  “caption.”    The 
caption  is  the  top  section  of  a  pleading,  motion,  or  petition  stating  the  name  of  the  Petitioner, 
Respondent, Court and the case number. 

Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office.  The Clerk 
will give you copies of each document back after stamping them with the date they were filed.  
This is called a “file stamp.”  You should keep one copy of each document for your records.  The 
other set of documents will need to be served upon the Respondent. 

RECAP for Step 2:  Start the modification action by filing the following documents with the Clerk of the District 
Court’s office located in the county courthouse where your original child support order was established: 

A.   Petition to Modify Custody and Support (attach certified copy of prior custody order);  
B.    Summons; and  
C.  Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order 
D.  Pay the filing fee 
E.  Take the original and two (2) copies of each document to the Clerk’s office   
a.  The Clerk will give you both copies back after file-stamping them  
b.  You should keep one copy for your records.  
c.  The other set of documents will need to be served upon the Respondent. 

   

     

             

tep 3. 

Serve the Respondent.  Once the Petition and Confidential Statement of 
the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  are  filed,  a  file-stamped  copy  of  each  must  be  formally 
given  to  (a/k/a  served  on)  the  Respondent.    Personal  service  of  the  Petition,  Confidential 
Statement  of  the  Parties  and  Summons  on  the  Respondent  by  a  Sheriff  is  required  unless  the 
Respondent completes an Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form.  Formal service is 
required for the Petition and the Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order 
so  the  Court  has  proof  that  the  other  party  actually  received  the  paperwork.    Other  forms  of 
service  exist,  but  these  are  the  easiest  methods  that  meet  the  formal  service  requirement  for  a 
Petition.    If  you  cannot  serve  the  Respondent  by  either  of  these  methods,  ask  the  Clerk  for 
additional forms for alternative methods of service. 
 

You  MUST  give  the  Respondent  official  notice  that  you  have  filed  a  Petition  and 
Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order within 90 days from the date that 
you filed them.  This is done by serving a file-stamped copy of the Summons, the Petition, and 
the  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child  Support  Order  upon  the  Respondent  or  by 
having  the  Respondent  sign  an  Acknowledgment  and  Acceptance  of  Service  form  stating  that

copies of those documents were received.  If  you do not serve the  Respondent within 90 days, 
your case can be dismissed by the Court. 

How to Serve the Respondent.  Choose ONLY ONE of the following options to 

serve the Respondent: 

Option 1– Service by Sheriff  
 

. 

  A

 

Summons.  It is recommended to have a Sheriff in the county where the Respondent can 
be  found  serve  him  or  her  with  the  papers.  There  will  be  a  separate  service  fee  (usually  fifty 
($50.00) dollars in Wyoming).   You can contact the Sheriff’s department in the county where 
the  Respondent  lives  to  determine  the  fee  charged  by  the  Sheriff.    This  is  also  true  if  the 
Respondent is going to be served out of state.   You will need to provide the Sheriff with a file-
stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Petition  and  Confidential  Statement  of  the  Parties  for  Child 
Support Order to be served on the Respondent. 
 

Proof of Service.  The Sheriff’s office will complete the last page of the Summons called 
the “Return” (or they may have their own form - an “Affidavit of Service”) and will usually file 
the  original  with  the  Clerk’s  office  and  send  you  a  copy.    If  you  receive  what  looks  like  the 
original “Return” or “Affidavit of Service” from the Sheriff, call the Clerk’s office to ensure the 
original has been filed.  If it has not, then file the original with the Clerk’s office and keep a copy 
for yourself.  This is the proof that the Respondent was given proper notice. 
 

Note:  Once the Respondent has been served, you MUST file the original Summons and 
the  original  Return  (or  Affidavit  of  Service)  with  the  Clerk’s  office  so  that  the  Judge 
knows that proper service was made. 

ption 2 – Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service.  If the Respondent agrees, he or she 
may  sign  a  form  stating  that  a  file-stamped  copy  of  the  Summons,  Petition  and  Confidential 
Statement of the Parties for Child Support Order were received.  If the Respondent agrees, you 
will need to fill out an Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form.  The Respondent must 
sign this document in front of a Notarial Officer.  

Proof of Service.  Once the Acknowledgement and Acceptance of Service form is signed, 
take  the  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  signed  form  to  the  Clerk’s  office  for  filing.    You 
should keep one copy for your records and provide the other copy to the Respondent. 
 

Note:  You must file the signed Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the 
original Summons with the Clerk’s office so that the Judge knows that proper service on 
the Respondent was made.

RECAP for Step 3:  You MUST give the Respondent official notice that you have filed a Petition within 90 days 
from the date you filed the Petition.  Choose one of the following methods: 

Option 1 – Service by Sheriff 

A.  Provide a copy of the Summons, Petition and Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child 

Support Order to the Sheriff where the Respondent lives; 

B.  Pay the service fee; and 
C.  Once  the  Respondent  is  served,  be  sure  the  original  Summons  and  the  original  Return  or 

Affidavit of Service are filed with the Clerk’s office; OR

A.  Provide a copy of the Summons, Petition and Confidential Statement of the Parties for Child 

Support Order to the Respondent; 

B.  Have the Respondent sign the Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form in front of a 

C.  File the original Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Service form and the original Summons 

Notarial Officer; and 

with the Clerk’s office. 

tep 4.  Wait for the Respondent’s time to respond to expire.  Once 
the Respondent is served, he or she has 20 days (if served in the State of Wyoming) or 30 days 
(if served out-of-state) to file a Response to the Petition.  You must wait for the appropriate time 
period to expire before you can proceed with the case.  You must wait the 20 days (or 30 days if 
served  out-of-state)  even  if  the  Respondent  tells  you  that  he  or  she  is  not  going  to  file  a 
Response.  

  Computation  of  Time  Limits.  In  computing  most  time  limits,  unless  otherwise 
stated, the day the document is served shall not be included. The last day of the time 
period is included, unless it lands on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, or, if 
the  Courthouse  is  closed  then  the  time  limit  will  be  on  the  very  next  day  that  the 
Courthouse is open.   If you have questions about time limits, you should seek the 
advice of an attorney. 
 

•  While waiting, move on to Step 5.  You can also use this time to continue to work on 

the other required forms to be sure they are filled out completely and correctly.

owed  individually  or  jointly;  location(s)  of  safety  deposit  box(es);  employment  information; 
information  regarding  other  income  and  retirement  accounts;  and  a  summary  of  the  facts 
believed to support the claim of superior entitlement to custody where child custody is at issue.  
Both  parties  are  required  to  provide  this  information  in  order  to  fully  disclose  finances  of  the 
parties relating to the calculation of child support.   

A.  WHEN  TO  PROVIDE:    You  must  provide  your  Initial  Disclosures  to  the 
Respondent  (or  his/her  attorney)  WITHIN  30  DAYS  AFTER  THE  RESPONDENT’S 
RESPONSE  IS  REQUIRED  TO  BE  SERVED  ON  YOU  (use  table  below).  Be  sure  to 
keep a copy of your Initial Disclosures form for your records.  Use the following to 
determine  the  date  when  you  and  the  Respondent  are  required  to  provide  initial 
disclosures to one another.     
 

1.  Begin  with  the  date  the  Respondent  was  served  with  the  Petition:  

______________________ 
 

2.  Next, determine when the Respondent is required to file a Response: 

.  If the Respondent was served in Wyoming, add 20 days to the date in #1:  

__________________________ 
OR 

b.  If  Respondent  signed  an  Acknowledgement  and  Acceptance  of  Service, 

add 20 days to the date in #1:  ___________________________ 
OR 

If the Respondent was served out-of-state, add 30 days to the date in #1:  
__________________________ 
 

3.  Add 30 days to the date in #2(a), (b), or (c):  ___________________________ 

The  date  set  forth  in  #3  is  the  date  by  which  you  and  the  Respondent  must  provide  your 
completed Initial Disclosures forms to one another. 

  a

c. 

 

DO NOT FILE THE INITIAL DISCLOSURES WITH THE COURT.  This 

B. 
form is only given to the Respondent (or his/her attorney). 

Please note that “A party must make its disclosures based on the information then reasonably 
available  to  it  and  is  not  excused  from  making  its  disclosures  because  it  has  not  fully 
completed  its  investigation  of  the  case  or  because  it  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  another 
party's disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.” 
 

RECAP  for  Step  5:    You  MUST  provide  your  Initial  Disclosures  to  the  Respondent  within  30  days  after  the 
Respondent’s Response is required to be served on you (use table in 5.A. above to determine date).  Mark on the 
calendar the deadline to provide your Initial Disclosures; and 

 

A. 
B. 

Provide your Initial Disclosures to the Respondent by the deadline. 
DO NOT file the Initial Disclosures with the Clerk’s office.

Step 6.  Once the time for the Respondent to file a Response has expired and you sent 
your Initial Disclosures to the Respondent, then several options exist to move your case 
forward to get a  modification of  your custody  and child support order.  Pick the option 
that best describes your situation: 
 

Option A. 

If  the  Respondent  filed  a  Response  or  Response  and  Counterclaim 

and you both agree on all of the issues of your case, follow Option A below. 

ption B. 

If  the  Respondent  did  not  file  a  Response  or  Response  and 

Counterclaim, follow Option B below. 

ption C. 

If  the  Respondent  filed  a  Response  or  Response  and  Counterclaim 

and you do NOT agree on all of the issues of your case, follow Option C.   

Option A. The following instructions apply if the Respondent filed a 
Response, or Response and Counterclaim, and you both agree on all 
the issues of your case.  If you and the Respondent agree on the issues involved in your 
case, then you will need to complete the following: 
 

Fill out a Confidential Financial Affidavit and attach all required documents.   

  O

  O

   

A. 
 

•  Both parties are required to file a Confidential Financial Affidavit including the 
required  attachments  with  the  Court.    If  the  Respondent  does  NOT  file  a 
Confidential  Financial  Affidavit,  you  will  need  to  complete  an  Affidavit  of 
Imputed  Income  to  show  the  Court  how  much  money  the  Respondent  makes.  
This is an additional form contained in your packet. 
 

•  Required  Attachments.    The  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  of  the  parties 
must be supported with documentation of both current and past earnings. Proper 
documentation  of  current  earnings  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  pay  stubs, 
employer  statements,  or  receipts  and  expenses  if  self-employed.  Documentation 
of  current  earnings  shall  be  supplemented  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  tax 
return to provide verification of earnings over a longer period. Include copies of 
income tax returns for the previous two years and your most recent pay stub(s) to 
show how much you have made so far this year.  

B. 

Fill  out  an  Order  Modifying  Custody  and  Support  (“Order”).    This  form  will 
need  to  be  filled  out  completely,  signed  by  both  you  and  the  Respondent  and  both  of  your 
signatures  notarized.   In addition to signing the  Order,  you should  also initial each page of 
the  Order  to  verify  that  each  page  contains  the  terms  you  agreed  upon.    Here  are  some 
relevant laws and helpful hints in completing the Order:

.  Military Personnel: Military regulations specify that military duty will not be  used 
as a basis for avoiding family support obligations, but setting the level of support is a 
civilian  matter.    It  is  most  common  to  set  the  support  obligation  based  on  basic 
military  pay.    You  can  go  to  www.dfas.mil  for  updates  on  military  pay  and  many 
other issues. If military pay and benefits are an issue in your child support case, you 
may  want  to  contact  an  attorney  for  assistance.    The  following  is  also  a  helpful 
website:   
https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/a-handbook-for-military-families 

.  Overtime compensation: Overtime compensation is not counted in the “net income” 
unless  the  court,  after  considering  all  overtime  earnings  derived  in  the  preceding 
twenty-four  (24) month period, determines  the overtime earnings can  reasonably  be 
expected to continue on a consistent basis. 

.  Entry of income withholding order.  An income withholding order (IWO) enables 
an employer to take child support out of the pay of the parent obligated to pay.  The 
court always enters an IWO which takes effect immediately, unless the parties agree 
otherwise, or unless one (1) of the parties demonstrates, and the court finds, that there 
is good cause not to require immediate income withholding. When the parties agree to 
an alternative arrangement, the arrangement must be in writing, signed by the parties 
and  reviewed  and  entered  in  the  record  by  the  court.  The  court  shall  include  in  the 
record 
including  a  statement  explaining  why 
implementation of immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests 
of  the  child  and,  in  cases  involving  modification  of  child  support,  proof  of  timely 
payments. 

its  findings  of  good  cause, 

An  income  withholding  order,  which  did  not  become  effective  immediately  upon 
entry,  becomes  effective  upon  the  earliest  of  the  following:  (i) the  date  the  parent 
paying  requests  withholding  commence;  or  (ii) child  support  becomes  delinquent  in 
payment of an amount equal to one (1) month's support obligation under the support 
order. 

.  Limits  on  amounts  withheld:  The  total  amount  that  can  be  withheld  from  any 
employee's paycheck is limited by the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). The 
limits  provided  in  the  CCPA  are  fifty  percent  (50%)  of  disposable  earnings  if  the

parent who pays child support has a second family and sixty percent (60%) if there is 
no second family. These limits are each increased by five percent (5%) if payments 
are  in  arrears  for  a  period  equal  to  twelve  (12)  weeks  or  more.    See  definition  of 
disposable income in paragraph 4 below. 

.  Social  security  or  veteran’s  benefits.    If  your  children  receive  part  of  a  parent’s 
social  security  or  veteran  benefits,  you  might  want  to  contact  an  attorney  or  legal 
services  program  for  assistance  with  child  support  calculation.  If  a  proportion  of  a 
support  obligor's  (person  who  is  supposed  to  pay  child  support)  social  security  or 
veteran's benefit is paid directly to the custodian (parent or guardian with custody of 
the children) of the obligor's children who are the subject of the child support order, 
the total amount of the social security or veteran's benefit, including the amounts paid 
to  the obligor and custodian under the child support order,  will be counted as gross 
income to the obligor (count the amount the children receive as income to the parent 
who has to pay support). You will need to calculate the child support due and subtract 
the  amount  of  the  social  security  or  veteran's  benefit  sent  directly  to  the  custodial 
parent from the noncustodial (obligor's) parent’s share of presumptive support.  If the 
subtraction  of  the  social  security  or  veteran's  benefit  sent  directly  to  the  custodian 
results in a negative dollar amount, the support amount shall be set at zero.  The child 
support  obligation  shall  be  offset  by  the  amount  of  the  social  security  or  veteran's 
benefit  sent  directly  to  the  custodian,  beginning  from  the  time  the  custodian  began 
receiving the social security or veteran's benefit.  Wyo. Stat. §20-2-304(e).     

.  Date new amount of child support begins.  An order for child support is not subject 
to  retroactive  modification  except:  (i)  Upon  agreement  of  the  parties;  or  (ii)  The 
order  may  be  modified  with  respect  to  any  period  during  which  a  petition  for 
modification is pending, but only from the date notice of that petition was served on 
the Respondent.   Wyo. Stat. §20-2-311(d). 

.  When  the  child  support  obligation  ends.      An  on-going  child  support  obligation 

terminates when the: 
(i)  Parents marry or remarry each other (After the remarriage of the parents to each 
other, the court may eliminate all child support arrearage existing between the parents 
except those assigned to the state of Wyoming); 
(ii)   Child dies;  
(iii)  Child is legally emancipated; or  
(iv)  Child attains the age of majority. (See “age of majority” definition below.)

individual, regardless of  source.  Income includes, but  is not limited to  wages, earnings, 
salary,  commission,  compensation  as  an  independent  contractor,  temporary  total 
disability, permanent partial disability, permanent total disability, worker's compensation 
payments,  unemployment  compensation,  disability,  annuity  and  retirement  benefits  and

potential  earning  capacity  (imputed  income)  of  the  unemployed  or  underemployed 
parent. In making that determination the court shall consider:  
1)  Prior employment experience and history;  
2)  Educational  level  and  whether  additional  education  would  make  the  parent 

  

more self-sufficient or significantly increase the parent's income;  

3)  The presence of children of the marriage in  the parent's home and its impact 

on the earnings of that parent;  

   4)  Availability of employment for which the parent is qualified;

➢  You CANNOT agree that no support will be paid.  The statutes allow 
for a reduced amount of support when you agree on joint physical custody 
and each parent keeps the child(ren) overnight for more than  twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the 
expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support. 
 

➢  If  the  difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the 
self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from 
the  tables  in  20-2-304(a),  the  support  obligation  shall  be  set  using  the 
difference  between  the  noncustodial  parent’s  net  income  and  the  self-
support reserve.  “Self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for 
one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically 
in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  United  States  department  of  health  and 
human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).  See W.S. § 20-
2-304(f).   
 

➢  There  are  NO  DEVIATIONS  from  the  presumed  support  allowed 
UNLESS the Court CHOOSES to deviate from the set amount because the 
amount was unjust or inappropriate in the particular case. The Court must 
include the specific reasons for deviation in the Order.  

➢  NO  AGREEMENTS  FOR  LESS  THAN  THE  PRESUMED 
SUPPORT  CAN  BE  APPROVED  IF  GOVERNMENT  OR  STATE 
BENEFITS  (SUCH  AS  TITLE  19,  KID  CARE,  FOOD  STAMPS, 
POWER,  ETC.)  ARE  BEING  PROVIDED  ON  BEHALF  OF  ANY 
CHILD.  This means the Court cannot lower the amount of child support 
calculated by using the net income of you and the Respondent even if you 
and the Respondent agree to a lower amount of support. 

•  Medical  Support.    The  law  requires  that  medical  support  for  the  child(ren)  be 
included as part of any child support order.  The Court shall order either or both 
of  the  parents  to  provide  medical  support,  if  insurance  can  be  obtained  at  a 
reasonable cost  and the  benefits  under the insurance  policy  are  accessible to  the 
children.    This  may  include  dental,  optical  or  other  health  care  needs  for  the 

•  Child  Support  Payments.    You  will  need  to  determine  the  amount  of  child 
support  due  based  upon  the  Confidential  Financial  Affidavits  you  and  the 
Respondent completed (or by the Affidavit of Imputed Income if the Respondent 
did not complete his/her own Confidential Financial Affidavit).  You may use the 
Child  Support  Computation  Form  as  a  guide  to  help  you  calculate  the  support 
due.  Another option is to go online to:

child(ren).    In  addition,  the  Court  will  order  that  any  medical  expenses  not 
covered  by  insurance  and  any  deductible  amount  on  the  required  insurance 
coverage  be paid  by one or both  parents.   If both  parents  are ordered to  pay for 
expenses  not  covered  by  insurance,  the  Court  will  specify  the  proportion  for 
which  each  parent  is  responsible  (for  example,  50%  to  Plaintiff  and  50%  to 
Defendant). 

 

Fill  out  an  Order  for  Income  Withholding.   The  Court  is  required  by  statute  to 

enter an Order for Income Withholding in every case where child support has been ordered.  

Fill out an Income Withholding for Support.  This form is required if you need to 
have  the  child  support  paid  directly  from  a  non-custodial  parent’s  employer.    If  you  need 
assistance  in  filling  out  this  form,  or  if  you  need  assistance  in  collecting  child  support,  you 
should contact the child support enforcement agency in your district.  The Clerk can provide you 
with the agency’s contact information. 

Other Forms:  The Court may also require other forms depending on the county 

where your case is filed.  Ask the Clerk if additional forms are required. 

. 

Copies and Envelopes.  Take an original and two (2) copies of each of the above 
documents for filing with the Clerk and two (2) addressed, stamped envelopes (one addressed to 
you and one to  the  Respondent with  enough postage to  cover the cost  of  mailing the Order to 
you and the Respondent).   A copy of any documents that you file (other than the Order) must be 
sent  to  the  Respondent  on  the  date  that  you  filled  out  on  the  Certificate  of  Service  on  each 
document.  

➢  If  a  hearing  is  not  required  by  your  Court,  the  Clerk  will  mail  a  copy  of  your 

Order if accepted by the Court.  
 

➢   If a hearing is required by your Court, follow the next steps: 

. 

Hearing.    In  some  Courts,  a  hearing  is  required  before  the  Judge  will  sign  the 
Order.    If  this  is  the  case,  you  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  the  Request  for 
Setting.  If you have reached an agreement, check the first box in paragraph 2 that states that the 
parties  have  both  signed  the  Order.    Indicate  how  much  time  you  will  need  for  the  hearing 
(usually 15 minutes if there is an agreement).  You will file the Order Setting Hearing with the 
Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the 
Respondent.    You  will  need  to  provide  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the 
Respondent to the Clerk.  These documents are additional forms contained in your packet. 

. 

Evidence.  At the hearing,  you will need to  inform the Judge that  you  meet  the 
requirements  for a modification of  a  custody and  child support order, that  you  have calculated 
child  support  based  on  the  net  income  of  the  parties,  and  whether  or  not  the  children  are 
receiving public benefits.  You will also give the Order signed by both you and the Respondent 
to  the  Judge.    The  Judge  may  ask  you  additional  questions.    The  Judge  will  not  guide  you

. 

When  will  your  custody  and  child  support  order  be  modified?    Your  order 
modifying custody and child support will not be effective until the Judge signs the Order and it 
is filed with the Clerk.  This process may take time if the Judge requires changes to the proposed 
Order.  You must verify with the Clerk that the Order has been file-stamped before you can be 
sure your custody and child support order has been modified. 

RECAP  for  Option  A:    If  you  and  the  Respondent  agree  on  all  issues  in  the  case  and  the  Respondent  filed  a

Default Hearing.  Some Courts will not enter a Default Order Modifying Custody 
and Support unless there is a hearing.  Ask the Clerk if this is required for your Court.  If it is, 
fill out a Request for Setting and request 15 minutes for the hearing.  You will file the Order 
Setting Hearing with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the hearing date and time and 
mail  a  copy  to  you  and  the  Respondent.    You  will  need  to  provide  an  addressed,  stamped 
envelope for you and the Respondent to the Clerk. 

E. 

Evidence.   At the hearing,  you will need to inform the Judge that  you  meet  the

ption C. If  the  Respondent  filed  a  Response,  or  a  Response  and 
Counterclaim,  and  you  and  the  Respondent  do  NOT  agree  on  all 
issues of your case, you will need to have a trial: 

A. 

You  must  file  a  Reply  to  the  Counterclaim.    If  the  Respondent  has  filed  a 
Response  and  Counterclaim,  you  will  have  a  time  limit  (usually  20  days)  to  file  a  written 
response (Reply to Counterclaim) to the counterclaim.  The original, signed copy of your reply 
must be filed with the Clerk and a copy must be sent to the Respondent (or his/her attorney).

•  Caution:  If you do not file the original Reply to Counterclaim with the Clerk 
within the time allowed, the Respondent can seek a default order against you 
and may get what he/she asked for in his/her counterclaim. 

B.

Trial.  If there is no agreement, your case will have to be heard and decided by a 

•  Caution:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  hire  or  find  an  attorney  to 
represent  you  at  trial,  though  you  may  represent  yourself.    You  proceed  at 
your own risk and will be expected to know the laws. 

C. 

Request  a  trial  date.    You  will  need  to  request  a  hearing  by  completing  a 
Request for Setting.  Write in “trial” where it asks the type of hearing.  Indicate how much time 
you  think  it  will  take  for  you  and  the  other  party  to  present  your  evidence  and  write  that  in 
(usually one (1) to three (3) hours).  You also need to decide whether or not you want a Court 
reporter  to  record  the  proceeding.    SEE  BELOW  FOR  DETAILS  ON  GETTING  A  COURT 
REPORTER. If a hearing is not recorded by an official court reporter, a transcript of the hearing 
will not be available.   It is very difficult to appeal the Judge’s decision if you do not get a court 
reporter to take down everything that is said at the trial.   

 

➢  You must file the Request for Setting and the Order Setting Modification Trial and 
Requesting Pretrial Statements with the Clerk’s office, and the Court will fill in the 
hearing date and time and mail a copy to you and the other party.  You will need to 
provide  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  for  you  and  the  Respondent  to  the  Clerk.  
Both the Request for Setting and the Order Setting Modification Trial and Requiring 
Pretrial Statements are additional forms contained in your packet.

Pretrial  Disclosures. 

  Both  parties  must  provide  to  other  party  AND 
PROMPTLY FILE WITH THE COURT the Pretrial Disclosures regarding the evidence that it 
may present at trial. If you have questions, you should contact an attorney. 

➢  When  are  the  Pretrial  Disclosures  due?  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the 

Court, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial.  

➢  Take the original and two (2) copies to the Clerk for filing.  Keep one copy for 
your records and send the other copy to the Respondent (or his/her attorney). 

E.  

Settlement before trial.  In the event that your case settles before the trial, you 
must  present  the  Court  with  the  completed  and  signed  Order  Modifying  Custody  and  Child 
Support  in  writing  before  the  Court  will  take  the  trial  off  of  the  schedule.  There  will  be  no 
continuances or canceling of the trial date based on telephone calls.  If you need a continuance, 
you should contact an attorney for assistance in seeking one.  

.       Court reporter.  If you wish to have a court reporter, you shall provide notice to 
the official court reporter as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days before 
the  matter  is  set  for  hearing.    You  can  provide  notice  to  the  court  reporter  by  phone  or  by 
submitting a written request.  Please note that if providing notice through the mail, the request 
must be received by the court reporter no later than three working days prior to the hearing.  The 
Clerk  will  be  able  to  inform  you  which  court  reporter  to  contact.    The  three-day  notice 
requirement  will  not  be  waived  by  the  Court.    The  notice  is  required  for  all  civil  matters 
including jury trials.  
 

G. 

 Evidence and witnesses.  At the hearing, you will need to present your evidence 
and  witnesses.    If  the  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and  Requesting  Pretrial  Statements  is 
entered  (signed  by  the  Judge),  you  must  follow  the  terms  and  provide  the  Court  with  the 
information requested in that document, including copies of exhibits you want to introduce at the 
trial and a list of your proposed witnesses and what their testimony is going to be about within 
the time frame ordered (usually 3 to 5 days prior to the trial).  Under the law, the Judge cannot 
help you or assist you at trial.  You are on your own without an attorney. 
 

H. 

Final  Decision  (Order).    Following  the  trial,  the  Judge  will  make  a  decision  or 
may  take  the  matter  under  advisement,  meaning  he  or  she  will  need  to  think  further  before 
making a determination.  If the Judge instructs you, you must take that decision and type it into 
the Order Modifying Custody and Child Support incorporating the Judge’s decision.

➢  You are again reminded that, if you choose to continue without an attorney, 
you are expected to know what to do and how to do it.  The Judge will not 
guide you through the trial/hearing, tell you how to proceed or advise you on 
the law. 

➢  You  MUST  also  file  the  documents  outlined  in  Step  6,  Option  A,  items  C 

through F above.

I.  When will your custody and child support order be modified?  Your custody 
and child support order will not be modified until the Judge signs the Order and it is filed with 
the Clerk of Court.   This  process  may take time if  the Judge  requires  changes to  the proposed 
Order.  You must verify with the Clerk’s office that the Order has been file-stamped before you 
can be sure your custody and child support order has been modified.  The time limit to appeal the 
Order begins to run from the day the Order is filed with the Clerk’s office.   

RECAP for Option C:  If the Respondent filed a Response or Response and Counterclaim and you do NOT agree 
on the issues, complete the following: 
Remember:  Take an original and two copies of each document to file with the Clerk’s office.  You will need to send 
a copy of any filed document to the Respondent unless otherwise stated below. 

1.

days after you receive the Response and Counterclaim.   

2.  Request a trial date  

a.  Request for Setting  
b.  Order Setting Modification Trial and Requiring Pretrial Statements  
c.  Take  an  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and 
Requiring  Pretrial  Statements  for  filing  with  the  Clerk  and  two  (2)  addressed,  stamped 
envelopes (one addressed to you and one to the Respondent with enough postage to cover 
the  cost  of  mailing  the  Order  Setting  Modification  Trial  and  Requiring  Pretrial 
Statements to you and the Respondent).    

3.  File your Pretrial Disclosures and Pretrial Memorandum 
4.  No later than 3 working days before the trial, request a court reporter, if desired. 
5.  Attend the Trial 
6.  Order Modifying Custody and Support  

a.  Take  an  original  and  two  (2)  copies  of  the  Order  for  filing  with  the  Clerk  and  two  (2) 
addressed,  stamped  envelopes  (one  addressed  to  you  and  one  to  the  Respondent  with 
enough postage to cover the cost of mailing the Order to you and the Respondent).    

7.  Order for Income Withholding 
8. 

Income  Withholding  for  Support  (or,  you  can  open  up  a  case  with  your  local  child  support 
enforcement agency) 

9.  Complete and file any additional documents required by your Court. 

 

Your custody and child support order is modified when the Order has been signed by the Judge and filed by 
the Clerk.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
