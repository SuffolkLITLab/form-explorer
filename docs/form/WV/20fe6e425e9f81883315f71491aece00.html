Will Executions and Alternatives During Coronavirus Pandemic 

Recommended Safety Protocols on How Attested Wills Should Be Executed 

 

The West Virginia Statute of Wills, Code § 41-1-3, provides that:  

under Attorney Supervision 
 

. 

  A

No will shall be valid unless it be in writing and signed by the 
testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his 
direction, in such manner as to make it manifest that the name is 
intended as a signature; and moreover, unless it be wholly in the 
handwriting of the testator, the signature shall be made or the will 
acknowledged by him in the presence of at least two competent 
witnesses, present at the same time; and such witnesses shall 
subscribe the will in the presence of the testator, and of each other, 
but no form of attestation shall be necessary. 

In light of the statutory requirement of the simultaneous “presence” of the testator with 

 
the witnesses and existing case law interpretation of this statute, the following guidelines are 
recommended as minimum safety protocols to reduce health risks if the attorney wishes to 
conduct in-person signing ceremonies for the execution of estate planning documents of clients: 

1.  All parties must self-screen prior to participating by ensuring his or her internal body 

temperature is below 100.4 degrees. 

2.  The meeting space must be disinfected before and after each signing. 
3.  All parties must wash hands before and after the meeting. 
4.  All parties must wear gloves and refrain from touching their faces. All parties must use 

appropriate technique in putting on, taking off, and disposing of gloves. 

5.  All parties must wear face masks. 
6.  All parties must bring and use their own pens. 
7.  Separation must be maintained with all parties being at least 6 feet apart.  
8.  Testator’s signature page is separate from the signature pages of the attesting witnesses in 

order to reduce interactive handling of pages. 

9.  Attesting witnesses’ page or pages may also be separate from the signature page of the 

testator. 

10. All pages must be integrated into the single document by logical page controls.  

a.  Pages in the document should be numbered.  
b.  Separations of signing sections in the document may be noted by statement that 
“SIGNATURES OF WITNESSES APPEAR ON FOLLLOWING PAGES.” 

 

Page 1 of 4 

11. If the original, executed document is to be given to the testator and copies are to be made, 

delivery of the original and copying of the document may be made using one of the 
following recommended alternatives: 

a.  Alternative 1 (Temporary Attorney Control of Original): Executed pages of the 

original will are collected and collated by the attorney, sealed in an envelope, and 
held by the attorney for 72 hours. This is a temporary holding only for safety 
reasons to reduce possible contamination. The attorney may then copy the 
document and deliver the original and a copy to the testator (or other custodian 
who will retain the original document).  

b.  Alternative 2 (Immediate Delivery of Original with Conformed Copy): Once 

signed, the executed pages of the original will are given by the witnesses to the 
testator who collates them and seals the original will in an envelope. Two 
conformed copies of the will are made by the witnesses during the execution of 
the original. Duplicate photocopies of the testator’s signature page are prepared in 
advance showing the typed (machine produced) date and signature style of the 
testator (“s/ John Q. Public”). Witnesses sign and date the photocopy duplicates of 
their pages. These are collated with the machine-produced pages showing the 
testator’s signing and become the two “conformed copies.” One conformed copy 
is given to the testator and one is retained by the attorney. The conformed copy 
contains original signatures of only the witnesses and does not have an original 
signature of the testator. The testator’s signature is “conformed” by having it 
typed (machine produced) so that the copy is not a fully executed, valid will unto 
itself. 

c.  Alternative 3 (No Touch iPhone Scan Copy): The pages of the original, executed 
will may be scanned in the Notes App on an iPhone using the camera without 
touching pages. The Note is saved as a PDF file and can be immediately emailed 
to both the testator and the attorney as an electronic copy. The testator is given the 
original will. 

12. Curbside document executions may be used to maintain safe separation of participants 

and avoids the need to clean the meeting space. 

a.  Testator remains in the vehicle, papers are passed through the window, and the 

window is rolled up during all signings.  

b.  Witnesses and attorney must be in safe proximity to observe actions and signing 
of the testator. The testator must be able to do the same for the actions of the 
witnesses.  

c.  Executed pages of the original will should be collected, collated, copied, and 

delivered by use of one of the Alternatives discussed above. 

13. IMPORTANT NOTE: Notarization is NOT required for a valid will in West Virginia. A 
“Self-Proof Affidavit,” which is signed by the attesting witnesses, assists with probate 
and is usually used. The affidavit is notarized, which means that the notary as another 
person must be present and handling pages.

the client and be easier and safer to accomplish, either in a remote manner or with reduced in-
person interaction. Alternatives to consider are: 
 

1.  Holographic will which is entirely in testator’s handwriting is valid in West Virginia. 

a.  Document should state that “This is my Will” or “This is my Will and I revoke all 

b.  At a minimum, document should (i) name an executor and (ii) dispose of assets, 

c.  Will may “waive bond and security of my executor” in order to save probate 

prior wills or codicils.” 

preferably “all of my assets.”  

costs. 

d.  Testator should date the document. 
e.  Testator must sign the document, preferably at the end of the document. 
f.  Typed or machine-printed forms, sentences, sections, or paragraphs should not be 
used in the holograph. Document must be “wholly in the handwriting of the 
testator.”  

2.  Inter vivos or living Trust Agreement can be used. A Trust can receive assets from a 

“pour over will,” or a Trust can hold assets for disposition after death as long as the assets 
have been transferred into the Trust during life. 

a.  Trust Agreement should be signed by the grantor and the trustee. 
b.  The grantor and trustee may be the same person. Successor trustees should be 

named. 

c.  Trust Agreement does not need to be notarized. 
d.  Trust Agreement does not need to be witnessed. 
e.  Trust Agreement is not required to hold assets during the grantor's lifetime but 
can be funded solely at the grantor's death from the grantor's “pour over will.” 

f.  Unless expressly stated otherwise, a Trust Agreement in West Virginia is 

revocable by the grantor. 

g.  Trust Agreement may dispose of assets held in the Trust upon and after the death 

of the grantor (make “testamentary dispositions”). 

h.  Trust Agreement may be used in combination with a holographic will. Testator 
can sign a short holograph which appoints an executor and gives all assets to the 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement which testator has just signed. Trust 
Agreement, which is prepared by the attorney and remotely delivered to client, 
can contain the dispositive or testamentary provisions that might otherwise be 
included in the testator’s will. This way, the attorney can prepare an effective 
Trust Agreement for remote delivery to and execution by the grantor who is also 
the trustee. If being executed at the same time as a will, Trust Agreement should 
be signed prior to the execution of the will.

i. 

IMPORTANT: Unless there is a “pour over will” which passes assets from the 
grantor’s probate estate into the Trust upon the grantor’s death, the Trust must be 
funded by the grantor during the grantor’s life by transferring or titling assets into 
the Trust. A Trust under a Trust Agreement which has no assets and receives no 
assets from a will or other transfer is not effective. 

3.  Client may be able to retitle assets in nonprobate forms, thereby passing assets directly to 
intended beneficiaries upon death. Many nonprobate assets can be created or transferred 
by remote means. Important types of nonprobate assets are: 

a.  Joint tenancy with right of survivorship. 
b.  Transfer on Death (TOD) registration for securities. 
c.  Transfer on Death (TOD) Deed for real estate. 
d.  Pay on Death registration for bank accounts. 
e.  Life insurance, annuities, and tax-qualified retirement accounts (IRA or 401(k)) 

requiring death beneficiary forms which may be changed. 

MPORTANT NOTE: Health guidelines can change rapidly, and attorneys should stay 
informed of any new developments or recommendations. In assisting a client, the attorney 
should evaluate the risks of taking action and doing a document as opposed to taking no 
action. The attorney should document what is being done and why it is being done for the 
protection of the client and the attorney. Estate planning and the execution of documents 
can be complex, and the attorney should in all events understand the law and act with legal 
knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary to achieve the 
client’s goals. Your Probate Committee is a resource in this area of law and willing to help 
practitioners in West Virginia.
