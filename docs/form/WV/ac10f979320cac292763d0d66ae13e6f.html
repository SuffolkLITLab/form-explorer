      <pre>This information has been prepared for persons who wish to make or have 
made a complaint to The Lawyer Disciplinary Board about a lawyer. Please read it 
carefully.    It  explains  the  disciplinary  procedures  and  is  designed  to  help 
persons with complaints. 

PUBLISHED AS A PUBLIC SERVICE   
BY THE OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL 

AWYER DISCIPLINARY BOARD 

The  Lawyer  Disciplinary  Board,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Office  of  Disciplinary 
Counsel,  has  jurisdiction  to  investigate  complaints  regarding  violations  of  the  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct; to hold hearings; and to make recommendations with respect to 
disciplinary  action  to  be  taken  against  lawyers.    The  Board  consists  of  two-thirds 
practicing  lawyers  and  one-third  non-lawyers,  all  appointed  by  the  President  of  the 
Board  of  Governors  of  The  West  Virginia  State  Bar.    The  Board  is  divided  into  an 
Investigative  Panel,  which  reviews  complaints,  and  a  Hearing  Panel,  which  presides 
over hearings and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West 
Virginia.     
 

The  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  consists  of  five  lawyers  [a  Chief  Lawyer 
Disciplinary Counsel and four Lawyer Disciplinary Counsel] and five support staff.    The 
Lawyer  Disciplinary  Board  and  the  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  are  funded  by  The 
West Virginia State Bar from dues paid by West Virginia lawyers. 

OMPLAINTS AGAINST JUDGES, MAGISTRATES, AND FAMILY COURT JUDGES 

The  Lawyer  Disciplinary  Board  does  not  handle  complaints  against  Judges, 
Magistrates, or Family Court Judges.    However, the Judicial Investigation Commission 
does handle those complaints and may be reached by calling (304) 558-0169.         

AWYERS' RULES ARE STRICT 

Most  lawyers  are  reputable  and  sincere.    West  Virginia  lawyers  have  adopted 
high standards of ethics and professional competence and they strive to maintain those 
standards.    One  of  the  ways  they  do  this  is  by  following  the  procedures  adopted  for 
their discipline.    No trade or profession has rules of conduct that are more exacting or 
more vigorously enforced. 

ENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

When  they  enter  practice  in  West  Virginia,  all  lawyers  obligate  themselves  to 
uphold  the  law and  to  abide  by  the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  which  regulate  the 
professional conduct of lawyers.    Those who violate these professional obligations are 
subject to discipline. 
 

However,  lawyers  are  human.    Some  are  more  competent  than  others.   
Sometimes  they  make  mistakes.    A  lawyer  may  lose  the  trust  and  confidence  of  a 
client  for  various  reasons.    In  many  cases  where  a  client  becomes  dissatisfied, 
grounds  for  discipline  do  not  exist.    Lawyers  may  be  disciplined  only  if  they  have 
  Mere  dissatisfaction  with,  or 
violated 

the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct.

disappointment  in,  the  results  of  litigation  or  other  legal  business  is  not  grounds  for 
disciplinary action against a lawyer. 

A  formal  complaint  of  unprofessional  conduct  against  a  lawyer  is  a  serious 
matter.    It puts into action the disciplinary process of The Office of Disciplinary Counsel 
and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia    The lawyer inevitably suffers from 
the accusation regardless of whether he or she is ultimately found to be at fault. 
 

If you believe your complaint is well-founded, by all means make it. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  you  feel  that  your  grievance  may  be  the  result  of 
inadequate communications--lack of sufficient agreement or some misunderstanding--it 
may be that the problem can be solved by a frank talk with the lawyer.    Tell him or her 
of  your  dissatisfaction,  and  ask  for  a  full  explanation  of  the  matter  involved.    Such  a 
discussion  will  often  eliminate,  or  lead  to  a  solution  of,  the  problem.    A  lawyer  who 
receives  an  ethics  complaint  from  his  or  her  client  may  attempt  to  withdraw  from 
representation,  if  you  are  the  lawyer's  client.    It  is  the  Board's  strong  preference, 
therefore, that you attempt to discuss your dissatisfaction with the lawyer, face to face, 
before you file a complaint. 

IME LIMIT ON FILING COMPLAINTS 

The Board cannot investigate complaints about conduct occurring more than two 

years ago, unless you only discovered the conduct more recently. 

NFORMAL COMPLAINTS 

If you have a problem concerning a lawyer which might be resolved quickly, such 
as  the  refusal  of  a  lawyer  to  return  your file  or a  lawyer's  failure  to  communicate,  you 
may  call  the  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  for  assistance  at  (304)  558-7999  without 
filing a complaint form. 

EE DISPUTES 

Fee  matters  ordinarily  are  not  a  basis  for  discipline  of  a  lawyer  because  they 

usually do not involve questions of ethics. 
 

The  West  Virginia  State  Bar  maintains  a  voluntary  fee  mediation  program.    If 
you and your attorney are willing to participate, a lawyer will attempt to resolve your fee 
dispute  informally.    Please  write  the  details  of  your  fee  dispute  to  Anita  R.  Casey, 
Executive  Director,  The  West  Virginia  State  Bar,  2000  Deitrick  Boulevard,  Charleston, 
West Virginia 25311.    Attach copies of any receipts, bills or other pertinent documents.   
 

There are some cases in which fee matters do involve questions of ethics, and in 
those cases discipline may follow.    Such cases include charging a fee in violation of a 
fee  statute,  failing  to  provide  an  accounting  or  settlement  statement,  or  failing  to 
distribute  proceeds  promptly.    If  you  file  a  complaint  which  contains  a  fee  dispute 
matter  not  involving  a  question  of  ethics,  the  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  may  refer 
the fee dispute to the State Bar for voluntary mediation. 
 

When the parties are not able to resolve their dispute through other means, the 
fee matter, like any other dispute over the value of goods or services, may be resolved 
by court action.

HE PURPOSE OF DISCIPLINE 

The purpose of a disciplinary proceeding is to administer discipline to the lawyer 
when  it  is  deserved.    The  Lawyer  Disciplinary  Board  does  not  and  cannot  give 
individual legal service or advice to any person making a complaint, nor can it provide a 
lawyer to any person. If you need assistance in finding a lawyer, you may access 
the  West 
at 
www.WVLawyerReferral.org.

Bar's 

Further, any loss the client may have sustained as a result of the matter involved 
cannot usually be recovered through disciplinary proceedings.    Even though the lawyer 
may  be  punished,  the  complaining  party  who  believes  he  or  she  has  been  damaged 
must enforce his or right by the  usual legal  methods.    The  statute  of  limitations  for 
bringing a legal action against a lawyer is not stayed during the time your ethics 
complaint is pending. 
 

The West Virginia State Bar does maintain a Client Protection Fund from which 
restitution  can  be  made  in  certain  cases  involving  a  lawyer's  misuse  of  client  funds.   
Information about this fund may be obtained from The West Virginia State Bar at (304) 
553-7225. 

ISCIPLINE OF LAWYERS 

Discipline of lawyers in West Virginia may take on several forms, depending on 
the  particular  circumstances  and  the  severity  of  the  offense:  probation,  restitution, 
limitation  on  nature  or  extent  of  practice,  admonishment,  supervised  practice, 
community  service,  public  reprimand,  suspension  from  practice  for  a  specified  time, 
disability suspension or disbarment. 
 

The procedures that are followed  in filing and processing a  complaint  against a 

lawyer are outlined here so that you may understand what is involved. 

OW TO FILE A COMPLAINT 

Anyone who feels his or her lawyer has engaged in professional misconduct may 
file a complaint with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel by submitting an affidavit setting 
forth  the  facts  on  which  the  complaint  is  based.    No  special  form  or  language  is 
necessary.    A  typed  letter  of  complaint  the  truth  of  which  is  sworn  to  before  a  notary 
public will be sufficient.    The Office of Disciplinary Counsel will provide you with a form 
upon request. 
 

In the complaint, you should write out or type out  in detail the  circumstances of 
your complaint.    Provide pertinent names, dates and facts known to you or to others to 
show the improper action.    You should state whether the attorney represents you and, 
if so, give all details concerning the agreement of representation, including details about 
the  fee  and  about  any  prepaid  retainers.    If  the  attorney  does  not  represent  you, 
explain  your  connection  to  the  attorney.    Attach  copies  of  any  documents,  letters,  or 
other materials that pertain to your complaint.

You must swear to the truth of matters in your complaint by signing the complaint 
before a notary public, who will also sign the complaint and place the notary's seal.    If 
you  have  questions  about  preparing  your  complaint,  call  the  Office  of  Disciplinary 
Counsel.    WE MUST HAVE A VERIFIED COMPLAINT WITH AN ORIGINAL SIGNATURE OR IT WILL NOT BE 
DOCKETED FOR REVIEW. 

EVIEW OF COMPLAINTS 

Once a complaint is received, it is reviewed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel 
to  determine if it alleges a  violation of any of the  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct.    If  a 
complaint  is  meritless  on  its  face,  or  fails  to  allege  a  violation  of  the  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct, the lawyer will not be asked to respond, and you will be notified 
that  the  complaint  will  not  be  investigated.    The  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  may 
determine  that  your  complaint  would  be  better  handled  by  another  program  or 
committee  of  The  West  Virginia  State  Bar,  such  as  the  voluntary  fee  mediation 
program, and your complaint may be referred to the other program or committee.    An 
employee  of  the  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  may  also  attempt  to  resolve  your 
complaint informally, as described in the section "Informal Complaints," above. 

NVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS   

If  the  complaint  alleges  a  violation  on  its  face,  then  the  Office  of  Disciplinary 
Counsel will investigate the complaint.    Investigations are primarily done by mail.    The 
lawyer  is  asked  to  provide  a  response  to  the  complaint,  and  you  will  usually  have  an 
opportunity  to  reply.    The  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  will  then  determine  if  other 
witnesses need to be contacted or documents reviewed. 
 

You  should  expect  the  investigation  will  take  time.    Filing  a  complaint  is  not  a 

"quick fix." 
 

Once  the  investigation  is  complete,  the  Chief  Lawyer  Disciplinary  Counsel  may 
dismiss the complaint if the investigation did not disclose evidence of a violation of the 
ethics  rules.    If  the  Chief  Lawyer  Disciplinary  Counsel  dismisses  the  complaint,  you 
may  request  a  review  by  the  Investigative  Panel.    When  there  is  evidence  of  a 
violation, or if there is a question as to whether a violation occurred, then the complaint 
will be reviewed by the Investigative Panel. 

NVESTIGATIVE PANEL ACTION 

When  the  Investigative  Panel  reviews  the  matter  it  may:    (1)  dismiss  the 
complaint if the there is no or insufficient evidence of a violation; (2) find a violation of 
the  ethics  rules,  but  determine  further  action  is  not  warranted;  (3)  issue  a  written 
admonishment to the attorney; (4) require additional investigation; 5) refer to mediation; 
or (6) issue formal charges against the lawyer and direct that a formal hearing be held. 

UBLIC HEARING 

When  the  Investigative  Panel  issues  formal  charges  against  the  lawyer,  a 
Hearing  Panel  Subcommittee  will  preside  over  a  public  hearing.    The  Hearing  Panel

  R

 

  I

  P

 

   

Subcommittee usually consists of three members of the Lawyer Disciplinary Board, one 
of whom must be a non-lawyer. 
 

The procedure in disciplinary hearings is similar to that in non-jury court trials.    A 
record  is  kept  by  a  reporter.    Testimony  is  given  under  oath.    The  rules  of  evidence 
are observed.    Attendance of witnesses may be compelled by subpoena.    The hearing 
is  open  to  the  public  and  proceedings  before  the  Hearing  Panel  Subcommittee 
thereafter are public. 
 

Based  upon  the  facts  developed  at  the  hearing  before  it,  the  Hearing  Panel 
Subcommittee  may  recommend  that  the  accused  attorney  should  be  disciplined  or  it 
may  recommend  that  discipline  is  not  warranted  and  recommend  dismissal  of  the 
complaint. 
 

The decision of the Hearing Panel Subcommittee is made in the form of written 
findings and recommendations, which are served upon the accused attorney and must 
be filed with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. 

CTION BY THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS OF WEST VIRGINIA 

Once  the  Hearing  Panel  Subcommittee  files  its  decision  on  the  formal  charges 
with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, the accused attorney is given the 
opportunity  to  be  heard  by  the  Court  in  the  form  of  written  briefs  and  oral  argument.   
Based  upon  the  facts  brought  out  in  the  hearing  before  the  Hearing  Panel 
Subcommittee, the Court then determines what, if any, discipline to impose.    Only the 
Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia may discipline an attorney. 

NVESTIGATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL 

Disciplinary  investigations  are  confidential.    The  reason  for  this  is  that  the 
complaint  against the lawyer usually  arises out of his or her transactions with  a  client, 
which are confidential.    This confidence would be violated and the private affairs of the 
client  exposed  if  disciplinary  investigations  were  made  public.    Also,  an  attorney's   
reputation and standing could be injured as the result of charges that have no basis in 
fact or have not been established by evidence.    We request that all correspondence or 
that all material you receive from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or the lawyer you've 
complained about be kept confidential.    If the complaint is closed, a written explanation 
will be made public.    Any formal charges filed and any proceedings thereafter will also 
be public. 

HAT YOU MAY EXPECT 

You may expect that the Lawyer Disciplinary Board will be genuinely concerned 
with  your  complaint.    It  will  receive  full  attention.    No  complaint  is  ever  "swept  under 
the  rug."    The  Lawyer  Disciplinary  Board  includes  non-lawyer  members  and  does  not 
exist to "whitewash" lawyer misconduct. 
 

You may be asked for additional information or be interviewed by a lawyer or an 

investigator, if necessary.
