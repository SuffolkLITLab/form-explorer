      <pre>RULES OF THE WEST VIRGINIA LAWYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
 

The Supreme Court recognizes that a wide range of influences can detrimentally 

affect the performance of a lawyer.    Prominent among such influences are the effects of 
chemical  dependence  or  mental  conditions  that  result  from  disease,  disorder,  trauma  or 
other  infirmity  that  impair  the  ability  of  a  lawyer  to  practice.    Lawyer  impairment  is 
detrimental to the interests of clients, litigants, our  legal  system,  the  general  public,  and 
the  health  and  quality  of  life  of  the  impaired  lawyer.    The  vast  majority  of  States  have 
responded  to  the  issue  of  lawyer  impairment  by  creating  funded  lawyer  assistance 
programs as contemplated by these rules, acknowledging the principle that every member 
of  the  bar  has  an  obligation  to  the  public  to  participate  in  an  appropriate  response  to 
lawyer impairment.    The Supreme Court finds that the West Virginia Lawyer Assistance 
Program is an appropriate method for addressing the issue of lawyer impairment and that 
the program will promote the integrity of the legal profession, thereby directly benefitting 
the people of West Virginia. 

ule 1.    Establishment of the West Virginia Lawyer Assistance Program (WVLAP). 

(a)  Establishment.  —  There  is  hereby  established  a  statewide  lawyer  assistance 
program to be known as the West Virginia Lawyer Assistance Program (WVLAP), which 
shall provide immediate and continuing help to lawyers who suffer from any physical or 
mental health conditions that affect their ability to practice. 

(b) Purpose.    — WVLAP has four primary  purposes:  (1)  To  protect  the  interests 
of  clients  and  the  general  public  from  harm  caused  by  impaired  members  of  the  legal 
profession; (2) To assist impaired members of the legal profession to begin and continue 
recovery; (3) To educate the bench, the bar, and the public to causes of and remedies for 
impairments affecting members of the legal profession; and (4) To develop programs that 
emphasize  prevention  of  conditions  that  might  negatively  affect  members  of  the  legal 
profession. 

(c)  Funding  and  Administration.  —  (1)  The  salary  of  the  executive  director,  and 
staff,  if  any,  their  expenses,  administrative  costs,  and  the  expenses  of  the  members  of 
WVLAP  shall  be  paid  from  funds  provided  by  The  West  Virginia  State  Bar.    The  total 
annual  salaries,  costs,  and  expenses  of  the  program  for  each  year  shall  not  exceed 
$60,000.    Each year WVLAP shall submit a proposed annual budget for the next year to 
the  Board  of  Governors  detailing  the  projected  revenues  and  expenses,  subject  to  the 
$60,000  limitation.    (2)  WVLAP  shall  seek  to  establish  additional  private  and  public 
sources  of  funding  that  may  include  gifts  or  bequests  from  any  source  and  earnings  on

volunteers  acting  on  behalf  of  WVLAP  under  Rule  4,  shall  be  absolutely  immune  from

(b)  Any  diversion  or  other  program  which  requires  involvement  of  WVLAP  in 
rehabilitative  efforts  on  the  part  of  the  lawyer  that  is  a  result  of  an  agreement  with  the 
Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  or  otherwise  imposed  by  order  of  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Appeals,  shall  govern  the  extent  and  scope  of  confidentiality  which  may  be  asserted  by 
the lawyer.    To the extent such agreement and/or order may require WVLAP to violate a 
confidentiality protection granted under these rules, the order or agreement shall  control 
and any disclosure made pursuant thereto shall not be deemed a breach of confidentiality 
otherwise imposed by these rules. 

(c)  At  any  time  it  deems  reasonable  and  feasible,  and  without  the  necessity  of 
amending these Rules, the WVLAP and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel may, through 
written  agreement  between  them,  establish  a  program  of  diversion  from  discipline  and, 
subsequent  entry  into  rehabilitation  for  those  lawyers  deemed  candidates  for  such  a 
diversion program. 

(d)  It  is  hereby  acknowledged  than  an  impaired  lawyer’s  completion  of 
rehabilitation in conjunction with WVLAP may be considered as a mitigating factor with 
respect  to  any  disciplinary  action  arising  out  of  the  impairment  for  which  rehabilitation 
was completed.
