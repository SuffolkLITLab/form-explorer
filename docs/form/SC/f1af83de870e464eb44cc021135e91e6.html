COVERSHEET FOR DMH AND DDSN EVALUATION ORDERS 
 

The Competency to Stand Trial Evaluation orders (SCCA 221 and SCCA 487) and the 
Criminal Responsibility (McNaughten) Evaluation order (SCCA 222) should not be 
altered.  It is important for purposes of compliance with the statutes as well as timeliness, 
efficiency and quality control in conducting evaluations that the applicable form order be 
used exactly as published, without alterations or additions to the terms of the form 
order.   

Additional records must be attached to the order for a complete evaluation.  It is the duty 
of counsel requesting the evaluation to obtain these records in advance and have them 
ready at the time the judge signs the order so that the evaluation will not be delayed.  
Within five (5) days of its issuance, counsel must file the order with the Clerk and serve 
the order on the examining agency.  A list of the necessary records is available on the last 
page of the order, and may include: 

  Completed DMH/DDSN Outpatient Information Appointment Sheet 
  Copy of the indictments(s)  
  Copy of the arresting agency’s incident report 
  Copy of the warrant(s) 
  Law enforcement investigative reports 
  The defendant or juvenile’s statements to law enforcement, written or 

electronically recorded 

  Witness statements to law enforcement 
  Autopsy reports  
  Defendant’s school psychological records  
  Defendant’s Rule 5(f) notice of insanity records  
  Copy of the Juvenile Petition  
  Special education records, including psychological evaluations and IEPs  
  School records, including disciplinary and attendance records  
  Mental health records, including inpatient and outpatient evaluation and/or 

treatment  

3.   

Only one Competency to Stand Trial evaluation can be ordered.  For Defendants with 
mental illness, the order is addressed to the Department of Mental Health.  For 
Defendants with an intellectual disability, the order is addressed to the Department of 
Disabilities and Special Needs.  The order may not be addressed to both agencies.  In the 
event there is a dual diagnosis or uncertainty as to the correct diagnosis, the order is first 
addressed to the Department of Mental Health, and the examiners will determine whether 
further referral is necessary.  All orders for criminal responsibility evaluation, regardless 
of the diagnosis, are forwarded to the Department of Mental Health.

This matter is before me for an order requiring the juvenile _______________________, 

charged with_____________________________________, to submit to an evaluation for 

competency to stand trial pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-410 (1976). 

BASIS FOR ORDER.   I have considered the showing made in support of the motion 

requesting this  evaluation  and have  reason  to  believe the juvenile may  lack the  competency to 

understand the criminal proceedings or to assist with the defense as a result of a lack of mental 

competence.    

This order is issued for the following reasons:  _________________________________ 

______________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________. 

THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:   The juvenile shall be examined and observed at an 

appropriate facility by two examiners of the Department of Mental Health if suspected of having 

a mental illness or by two examiners designated by the Department of Disabilities and Special 

Needs if suspected of having an intellectual disability or a related disability, to render an opinion 

whether the juvenile is competent to stand trial. 

SCCA 487 (7/2019) 

2 of 8  

COMPLIANCE DEADLINE/TRANSPORT FOR EVALUATION.  The examining 

facility shall schedule the ordered examination no later than thirty (30) days from the examining 

agency’s receipt of this order.  If the juvenile is currently released pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. 

§63-19-810 (A) counsel for the juvenile will be notified of the date, place and time of the 

evaluation. Counsel for the juvenile shall notify the person responsible for producing the juvenile 

(parent/guardians/custodian) of the evaluation.  The person responsible for producing the 

juvenile (parent/guardians/custodian) is responsible for making transportation arrangements to 

attend the examination.   In the event the juvenile does not appear at the scheduled examination, 

upon written notice of such failure by the examining agency to the Court and to the South 

Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice, a summons or a warrant may be issued for the 

apprehension of the juvenile and of the responsible person. If the juvenile is in detention at the 

time of the scheduled examination, the Sheriff is hereby authorized and required to transport the 

juvenile to and from the examination, arriving at the examining facility at the time established by 

confirmed appointment with the staff of the examining facility.  In the event the juvenile is in the 

custody of a law enforcement agency other than a Sheriff’s department, nothing herein prevents 

such agency from carrying out the provisions of this order. 

 

TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE AGENCY.    If the initial examination is performed by 

the Department of Mental Health, and examiners find indications of an intellectual disability or a 

related disability but not mental illness, the Department of Mental Health shall not render an 

opinion on mental competency, but shall inform the Court, prosecutor, and defense counsel that 

the juvenile is “not mentally ill” and shall provide a copy of such notification and a copy of this 

order to the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs.  Likewise, if the initial examination is 

performed by the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, and examiners find indications 

of mental illness but not an intellectual disability or a related disability, the Department of 

Disabilities and Special Needs shall not render an opinion on mental competency, but shall 

inform the Court, prosecutor,  and defense counsel that the juvenile does “not have an 

intellectual disability or a related disability” and shall provide a copy of such notification and 

this order to the Department of Mental Health.    

In either case, the examining agency shall make copies of any records gathered or created 

in connection with its examination available to examiners designated by the alternate agency, and 

the alternate agency shall thereafter designate examiners to evaluate defendant as to competency 

to stand trial within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification from the initial examining agency. 

SCCA 487 (7/2019) 

3 of 8  

FINDING OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS.   If examiners of either the Department of Mental 

Health or the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs find an indication of a dual diagnosis 

of mental illness and an intellectual disability or a related disability, no opinion on the juvenile’s 

mental  competency  shall  be  rendered,  and  the  dual  diagnosis  must  be  reported  to  the  Court, 

prosecutor,  and  defense  counsel.    The  examining  agency  shall  also  provide  notification  of  the 

finding and a copy of this order to the other agency.  Thereafter, the Department of Mental Health 

and the Department  of Disabilities and Special Needs shall arrange for  an examiner from  each 

agency to further evaluate the juvenile to render a final report on the juvenile’s mental competency. 

Both  agencies  are  authorized  and  required  to  make  copies  of  all  relevant  records  within  their 

possession or control available to examiners for purposes of completing the dual evaluation. 

AUTHORIZATION FOR INPATIENT EVALUATION.  In the event examiners from 

either agency determine the juvenile requires an inpatient examination, upon written notice to this 

Court from the director of the examining agency or his designee, the juvenile shall be committed 

to  an  appropriate  facility  of  the  requesting  agency  for  no  more  than  fifteen  (15)  days  for 

examination  and  observation  related  to  the  juvenile’s  mental  competency  to  stand  trial.    If  the 

examination  and  observation  of  defendant  has  not  concluded  at  the  end  of  the  initial  inpatient 

fifteen (15) days, the juvenile may be kept in the continued custody of the agency for an additional 

period  not  to  exceed  fifteen  (15)  days,  provided  the  director  of  the  examining  facility  or  his 

designee notifies this Court in writing.  The issuance of an additional Court order allowing for the 

inpatient commitment(s) as discussed in this paragraph is not necessary.   

DETENTION BEYOND EVALUATION PERIOD.   If, in the judgment of the 

designated examiners, the juvenile is in need of immediate hospitalization or inpatient treatment, 

upon written request to this Court from the director of the examining facility or his designee, the 

juvenile may be detained by the requesting agency in a suitable facility for so long as deemed 

clinically necessary or until a hearing required and provided by S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-430 

(1976) may be conducted by this Court.  An additional Court order shall be necessary for 

ongoing pre-trial inpatient detention of the juvenile as discussed in this paragraph. 

ISSUANCE AND ADMISSIBILITY OF WRITTEN REPORT.   Within ten (10) days 

of all examinations or the conclusion of the observation period, a written report shall be made to 

the Court pursuant  to  S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-420 (1976).   A copy of the  report shall also  be 

forwarded to the prosecutor and defense counsel.  This evaluation report shall be admissible as 

evidence in subsequent  hearings pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-420 (C) (2006); thus, the 

SCCA 487 (7/2019) 

4 of 8  

report is a statutory exception to the rule against hearsay and shall be admissible without need for 

foundational testimony.  However, the report shall be inadmissible in any other proceedings except 

as expressly permitted by South Carolina law. 

OWNERSHIP AND DISCOVERABILITY OF EXAMINING AGENCY FILES.  The 

examining agency is an independent entity, conducting this evaluation pursuant to Court order, 

and is not aligned with any party before the Court.  To promote full disclosure and to assure the 

cooperation of the juvenile during the evaluation process, ownership of the examining agency’s 

files  shall  be  vested  with  the  examining  agency,  including  clinician’s  notes,  staff  reports, 

evaluation documents, memoranda, test results, etc.  Neither these files nor any of their contents 

shall be provided to  any party except upon presentation of a Court order authorizing such or a 

release authorization in proper form.  In the event the examining agency’s evaluation opinion is 

contested, an examiner may be appropriately and fully questioned as to the basis for the examiner’s 

opinion at any hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-430 (1976).  However, examiners and 

agency staff may not be compelled to testify regarding statements made during the competency 

examination for any purpose other than to establish competency.  Also, statements made during 

the examination may not be used to impeach the juvenile at trial. Hudgins v. Moore, 337 S.C. 333, 

524 S.E.2d 105 (1999).   

MEDICAL PROVIDERS/SCHOOLS MUST RELEASE NECESSARY RECORDS.  

State  agency  examiners  conducting  the  evaluation  may  need  clinical  and  school  records 

concerning the juvenile to assist in forming an opinion.  It is therefore ordered, upon presentation 

by the examining agency of this order with a written request for specific records attached thereto, 

that any physician or clinician, licensed health care facility, licensed health care provider, or any 

school district is hereby authorized and required to furnish copies of all records concerning the 

juvenile to the Department of Mental Health or the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, 

or both.   

 

COUNSEL  REQUIRED  TO  FURNISH  NECESSARY  RECORDS.    Upon  written 

request from the examining agency, counsel for the prosecution and defense shall furnish to the 

agency such records and information in counsel’s possession as the agency requests, including but 

not limited to copies of law enforcement reports, investigations, witness statements, statements by 

the juvenile (both written and electronic), the juvenile’s medical records, and prior psychiatric or 

psychological evaluations of the juvenile.  Nothing herein shall be construed to require counsel to 

divulge any information, documents, notes, or memoranda that are protected by attorney-client 

SCCA 487 (7/2019) 

5 of 8  

privilege or work-product doctrine. 

DUTIES OF DEFENSE COUNSEL.  Unless the prosecution is the party moving for 

this evaluation, defense counsel has the responsibility to file, serve, and transmit this order as 

outlined in the final paragraph below.  Defense counsel does not have the right to attend any 

clinical interview scheduled pursuant to this Order, nor does the juvenile have a constitutional 

right to compel counsel’s attendance. State v. Hardy, 283 S.C. 590, 325 S.E.2d 320 (1985).  The 

Court recognizes, however, that circumstances may arise through which the examining agency 

may request counsel’s attendance to facilitate the examination.  In the event that such a 

determination is made, the examining agency may request counsel’s attendance in writing, and 

counsel’s level of participation shall be prescribed by the examining agency’s written evaluation 

protocol.  In this event, because of the substantial number of individuals awaiting examination, 

such interviews cannot be rescheduled, postponed, or canceled to accommodate counsel except 

upon presentation to the examining agency of a written statement from a circuit court or family 

court judge that counsel’s attendance is required in Court at the time the examination is 

scheduled.  Whether or not defense counsel is requested to attend the clinical interview, defense 

counsel must meet with the juvenile prior to the interview to discuss this Court order, the 

evaluation process, the clinical interview, the juvenile’s rights with regard to the clinical 

interview, and penalties associated with non-appearance and non-cooperation.  Failure to comply 

with these requirements may result in sanctions for defense counsel.  The juvenile’s refusal to 

participate at the interview because of the absence of counsel will be deemed non-cooperation.  

Failure of the juvenile to cooperate or participate in the interview may result in cancellation of 

the interview, examiners being unable to offer an opinion on competency to stand trial, and the 

case being called for trial without completion of the evaluation. 

FILING, SERVICE,  AND TRANSMITTAL OF ORDER.   It  is the responsibility of 

counsel for the party requesting the evaluation to file and serve this order as outlined herein.  In 

the event the evaluation has been requested by consent, or the moving party cannot be determined, 

defense counsel shall be responsible.  After being signed by the Court, the original order without 

attachments shall be immediately filed with the Clerk of Court and a certified copy served upon 

the opposing party.  Further, within five (5) business days, a certified copy of this order, together 

with the attachments listed at the end of this order, must be served upon the examining agency at 

the address listed below.  To expedite commencement of the evaluation process and scheduling of 

the clinical interview, counsel is instructed to immediately contact the examining agency to advise
