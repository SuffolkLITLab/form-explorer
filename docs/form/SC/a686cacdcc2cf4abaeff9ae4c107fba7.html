REQUESTING COURT APPROVAL FOR ABORTIONS 

DO I HAVE TO GO TO COURT? 

You do not need a court order to get an abortion if you are 17 or older; if you have ever been married; if you have a court order 
of emancipation; or if you have the consent of one parent, a legal guardian, one grandparent, or someone who has been acting 
as your parent for at least 60 days. 

WHERE CAN I GO FOR ASSISTANCE IN PREPARING AND FILING MY REQUEST? 

The county Clerk of Court will provide you with very simple forms which were designed so that you can fill them out yourself, 
and start the court procedure as fast as possible.  Take a look at the forms, and see if you need help in filling them out.  If you 
do, the Department of Social Services (Adoption and Birth Parent Services) can help you.  Their office address and telephone 
number are found on the reverse side of these instructions.  Also, the Clerk of Court can appoint a lawyer for you to help you 
fill out these forms, if you ask for a lawyer and are unable to pay one.  Remember that a lawyer (if you ask for one) will help 
you at the hearing.  If you made mistakes filling out the form, your lawyer can correct things at the hearing. 

WHAT COURT WILL HANDLE MY REQUEST? 

You may file your request in either circuit or family court in any county in the State.  If neither court is in session in the county 
where you file your request, the clerk will arrange for you to have a hearing in a nearby county.  If you are unable to obtain 
transportation, please notify the Clerk of Court. 

DO I HAVE TO PAY ANY MONEY TO FILE THIS REQUEST? 

If you declare that you don't have enough money to file you request, the court will not charge you. 

HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED OF WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT? 

The court will send court documents to your Guardian ad Litem and to your attorney, if you have one.  You can choose whether 
or how you personally want to receive these papers: 
(1)  You can choose to have them sent to you at any address you want; 
(2)  You can have them sent to someone else, whom you choose; 
(3)  You can have them sent to you and this other person you choose; 
(4)  You can have them sent to your Guardian ad Litem, your attorney (if you have one) and no one else. 

WHO WILL KNOW ABOUT MY REQUEST? 

If you wish, you may use the name "Jane Doe" and never tell your name to anyone.  The only place your name would appear 
would be on one piece of paper that would be kept in a sealed envelope with the court.  No one but you, your  Guardian ad 
Litem,  your  attorney  (if  you  have  one),  any  person  you  ask  the  court  to  notify,  and  court  personnel  will  know  about  this 
proceeding,  and  they  are  all  sworn  to  secrecy.    The  hearing  will  be  closed  to  the  general  public  (you  may  have  any  person 
present at the hearing you want, however) and all of your records will be sealed. 

WILL A GUARDIAN AD LITEM BE APPOINTED TO ASSIST ME? 

When you file your request, the Clerk of Court will appoint a Guardian ad Litem for you.  You may ask the Clerk of Court to 
appoint a specific person as your Guardian ad Litem.  If you receive a court-appointed Guardian ad Litem, the clerk will tell 
you the name, address and telephone number of your Guardian ad Litem, and can assist you in setting up an appointment to see 
your  Guardian  ad  Litem.    The  Clerk  of  Court  will  notify  your  Guardian  ad  Litem  by  telephone  and  in  writing  of  the 
appointment and hearing date. 

WILL AN ATTORNEY BE APPOINTED TO REPRESENT ME? 

You have a right to a lawyer, and the Clerk of Court will appoint a lawyer to represent you, if you ask.  You may choose to 
represent yourself in court.  If you want an attorney, the Clerk of Court will provide the name, address and telephone number of 
your lawyer.  The Clerk of Court can assist you in setting up an appointment to see your lawyer.  The Clerk of Court will notify 
an appointed attorney by telephone and in writing of the appointment and the date of hearing. 

WILL I HAVE TO PAY MY GUARDIAN AD LITEM OR MY ATTORNEY? 

No, not if the court finds that you don't have enough money to pay your Guardian ad Litem or your attorney. 

WHAT CAN I DO IF I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THE COURT'S DECISION? 

A Notice of Intent to Appeal (Form SCCA 465) to the South Carolina Supreme Court must be filed with the county Clerk of 
Court within 72 hours of the date you receive the court order.  It is strongly recommended that you have an attorney handle an 
appeal since important documents must be filed and deadlines must be met.  Ask the Clerk of Court to appoint you an attorney 
if you don't already have one.  When the Notice of Intent to Appeal is filed, the Clerk of Court will notify South Carolina Court 
Administration so that the transcript can be prepared on time.  If you or your attorney desire to prepare a memorandum to law 
or brief, if should be filed with the Supreme Court within 10 days of the filing of the Notice of Intent to Appeal.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
