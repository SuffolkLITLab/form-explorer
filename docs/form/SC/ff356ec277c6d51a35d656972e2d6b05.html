INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE  
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT SIMPLE DIVORCE 
PACKET  
 
DEFENDANT 

ARNING: You are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before filing 
any legal matter. This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing themselves in court. If you proceed without an attorney, it may negatively affect 
your legal rights. If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your legal rights, consult an attorney. Please note that clerks of court, court staff and judges 
cannot give you legal advice. 

ISCLAIMER:  The information in this packet is not legal advice and cannot replace the 
advice of competent legal counsel licensed in your state. Divorce laws vary from state to state 
and the information contained in this packet is specific to South Carolina. Please note that the 
information contained in this packet is subject to change and make sure that you have the most 
current version of this packet before filing. 

ART 1:  YOUR ROLE AS A DEFENDANT 

he following instructions will help you file an Answer for a simple divorce in South Carolina 

pro se, or without an attorney.  Pro se is a Latin term meaning “in person” or “on one’s own 

behalf.”  As the courts see more people representing themselves in court, you may also hear the 

term self-represented litigant instead of pro se.  While the self represented litigant may not incur 

the attorney expense, the self-represented litigant does not have the expert guidance that a lawyer 

can provide.   

etting a divorce is not an easy process, and divorce should not be taken lightly.  The self-

represented simple divorce packet is designed for people who meet all of the following: 

  Are filing on the ground of One (1) Year Continuous Separation without co-

  Have no marital property OR have reached an agreement on how to divide the marital 

habitation  

property  

  Have no marital debt OR have reached an agreement on how to divide the debt

  Have no children AND none are expected AND 

  Have minor children and have reached an agreement as to custody, visitation, and 

child support that meets the minimum requirements as set by the South Carolina 

Child Support Guidelines. 

f you and your spouse have been living in separate dwellings for less than one (1) year or 

cannot agree on the issues regarding minor children, property, and debt, then obtaining a 

divorce on your own is not recommended.  You need to hire an attorney.   

f you do not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South Carolina Bar’s 

Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a Family Law attorney in your county.

than 3 years, are in good standing, have provided proof of malpractice insurance, and have 

agreed to provide a 30 minute consultation for no more than $50.  If you believe you qualify for 

South Carolina Legal Services (SCLS), you may contact their Legal Aid Telephone Intake 

Service (LATIS) at 1-888-346-5592.  Please note that to qualify for SCLS, your income must not 

be more than 125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. 

f you and your spouse have been living in separate dwellings for more than one (1) year without 

co-habitation and can agree on all of the issues involving minor children, property, and debt, the 

next step is to study all of the forms listed below.  The name of each form can be found in the 

upper right hand corner and the form number in the bottom left hand corner.  

he following three (3) forms are included in this packet:  

  Defendant’s Answer (SCCA 400.05 SRL-DIV) 

  Financial Declaration Form (SCCA 430) 

  Affidavit of Service by Mailing (Answer) (SCCA 400.06 SRL-DIV)

witnesses have testified, you will be given an opportunity to testify and present witnesses for 

your case.  The judge may interrupt you from time to time to ask you a question.  Listen 

carefully, and answer the questions the judge asks you.  If the judge grants the divorce, the judge 

will sign the Final Order for Divorce and you will receive a copy.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
