      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE  
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT SIMPLE DIVORCE 
PACKET 
 
PLAINTIFF  

WARNING:  You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  seek  the  advice  of  an  attorney  before  filing 
any legal matter. This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing  themselves  in  court.  If  you  proceed  without  an  attorney,  it  may  negatively  affect 
your legal rights. If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your  legal  rights,  consult  an  attorney.  Please  note  that  clerks  of  court,  court  staff  and  judges 
cannot give you legal advice. 

ISCLAIMER:    The  information  in  this  packet  is  not  legal  advice  and  cannot  replace  the 
advice of competent  legal  counsel  licensed in  your state. Divorce laws vary  from  state to  state 
and the information  contained in  this packet is  specific to South  Carolina. Please note that  the 
information contained in this packet is subject to change and make sure that you have the most 
current version of this packet before filing. 

*Information  on  page  4  of  this  packet  has  been  amended  as  of  February  2016  to  include 
reference to the revised Certificate of Exemption**  

PART 1: COMPLETING YOUR PAPERWORK 

he following instructions will help  you file  for a simple divorce in  South  Carolina  pro  se, or 

without an attorney.  Pro se is a Latin term meaning “in person” or “on one’s own behalf.”  As 

the  courts  see  more  people  representing  themselves  in  court,  you  may  also  hear  the  term  self-

represented  litigant  instead  of  pro  se.    While  the  self-represented  litigant  may  not  incur  the 

attorney expense, the self-represented litigant does not have the expert guidance that an attorney 

can provide.

etting a divorce is not an easy process, and divorce should not be taken lightly.  If you are not 

sure  whether  you  want  to  divorce,  do  not  file  these  forms.    You  may  want  to  consider  an 

alternative  such  as  mediation.    When  you  are  sure  you  want  to  file  for  a  divorce,  a  filing  fee 

($150) will be collected by the Clerk of Court at the time of filing.  Additionally, Clerk of Court 

offices may charge their standard copy fee for the forms in this packet if you request the forms 

from their offices.

Declaration  Form  (SCCA  430).    On  all  five  (5)  forms  print  your  name  in  the  space  labeled 

“Plaintiff.”  Next, print your spouse’s name where it is labeled “Defendant.”  This section of all 

legal forms is called the caption.  This caption should be completed on all forms filed with the 

court. 

n the Family Court Cover Sheet (SCCA 467), print your contact information in the appropriate 

spaces below the caption, which includes your name, address, and a reliable telephone number.  

Please check the box next to “divorce” to indicate the action you are filing.  Sign and date the

option, "All contested issues have been previously subjected to an ADR conference meeting the 

requirements of the ARD Rule (Proof of ADR must be attached)" will apply.  If you are not sure, 

proceeding  on  your  own  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  you,  and  you  may  want  to  hire  an

spouse have lived in South Carolina.  You cannot file for divorce in South Carolina unless either 

you or  your spouse have resided in South Carolina for a certain period of time, either: (1)  you 

have lived in South Carolina for at least one year prior to the start of this action; (2) you are a 

resident of another state, but your spouse has lived in South Carolina for at least one year prior to

The Financial Declaration Form asks questions about the finances of both you and your spouse.  

Fill  out  the  sections  of  the  form  that  apply  to  you.    If  applicable,  attach  a  copy  of  your  most 

recent  pay  stub.    You  must  take  the  Financial  Declaration  Form  to  a  notary  public  before  you 

sign it.   Do not sign this form until you are in front of a notary.  The notary must witness 

your signature on the Financial Declaration Form.    

The  next  step,  which  officially  begins  the  divorce  process,  is  to  file  the  papers  with  the 

appropriate Clerk of Court, Family Court Division, and to pay the filing fee ($150).  If you, the 

Plaintiff, are a resident of South Carolina, you can choose one of the three following courthouses 

in which to file your case: 

a)  in the county where you and your spouse last shared a residence, OR 

b)  in the county where your spouse lives at the time of filing, OR 

c)  in the county where you live, if your spouse is a non-resident of the State of South 

Carolina. 

f you, the Plaintiff, are not a resident of South Carolina, the action must be filed in the county 

where the Defendant lives.  Physical locations of all South Carolina Family Courts can be found 

in the telephone book or online at http://www.sccourts.org.  Only bring cash, a cashier’s check, 

or money order for the filing fee ($150); do not bring a personal check. 

f  you  feel  you  are  unable  to  pay  the  filing  fee  because  you  do  not  meet  the  federal  poverty 

guidelines, you may submit the form titled “Motion and Affidavit to Proceed In Forma Pauperis” 

with a copy of your signed and notarized Financial Declaration attached to the Motion to 

the  Clerk  of  Court.   By  filling  out  and  signing  this form  and  having  it  notarized,  you  are 

swearing under oath that you do not have the funds available to pay the filing fee ($150).  The 

judge will review your motion.  If the motion is denied, you must pay the filing fee ($150) and 

other fees by the date set by the court.  If the fee is not paid on or before that date, your case will 

be dismissed, and you will have to begin the process again by re-filing your information.

After you determine which Family Court is the correct county in which to file,  make two copies 

of the entire packet and take your originals and copies to the Clerk of Court in that county. The 

Clerk of Court will:  (1) assign your case a docket number; (2) record the docket number on the 

upper right hand corner of all of the forms; (3) keep the originals; and (4) return two copies of 

the forms to you.  It is important that you print the docket number that has been issued for your 

case on all future forms you file with the court.   

PART 2: SERVICE OF PROCESS 

fter you receive copies of the documents from the Clerk of Court, you will need to serve one 

copy  of  the  Family  Court  Cover  Sheet,  Certificate  of  Exemption,  Summons  for  Divorce, 

Complaint for Divorce, and the Financial Declaration Form on your spouse or spouse’s attorney. 

This is called Service of Process and can be done in one of four ways: 

1) U.S. MAIL  

You  must  send  these  documents  Certified  Mail,  Restricted  Delivery,  Return  Receipt 

Requested.   When  you  get  the return  receipt  card  (green card) back from the U.S.  Post 

Office, check it to make sure your spouse signed the card.  If someone other than your 

spouse signed the return receipt card (green card), re-send all the documents again 

by certified mail.  

If  you  receive  the  return  receipt  card  (green  card)  and  it  was  signed  by  your  spouse, 

record the docket number you received from the Clerk of Court and the words “Summons 

and Complaint” across the top of the return receipt (green card) and then make a copy of 

the card  for  your file.   Next,  complete and sign the Affidavit  of Mailing  form  before  a 

notary.   Do not sign this form until you are in front of a notary.   The notary must 

witness  your  signature  on  the  Affidavit  of  Mailing.    Attach  the  return  receipt  card 

(green  card)  to  the  notarized  Affidavit  of  Mailing  and  take  it  to  the  Clerk  of  Court’s 

office for filing.

If  you  do  not  get  the  return  receipt  card  (green  card)  back,  you  may  have  to  call  your 

local Sheriff’s office to serve the papers on your spouse.  There may be a charge for this 

service  by  the  Sheriff’s  office.    If  your  Motion  to  Proceed  In  Forma  Pauperis  was 

granted, provide a copy to the Sheriff’s office. 

2) PERSONAL SERVICE  

If  your  spouse  is  willing  to  accept  service,  provide  your  spouse  with  an  Acceptance  of 

Service form.  After your spouse completes the form, take it the Clerk of Court’s office 

for filing.  Ask the Clerk of Court to make a copy of the form for you at the time of filing. 

) SHERIFF’S OFFICE 

Contact the Sheriff’s office in the county where the Defendant lives or works to serve the 

papers.  When the Sheriff serves the papers, ask the office to complete the bottom half of 

the  Affidavit  of  Service  form  before  a  notary,  have  the  form  notarized,  and  return  the 

form to you.  File the notarized Affidavit of Service with the Clerk of Court.   

4) PRIVATE PROCESS SERVER 

Private  process  servers  are  listed  in  the  telephone  book.    There  will  be  a  fee  for  this 

service.    Using  a  calendar,  count  thirty-five  (35)  days  after  your  spouse  received  the 

forms  (not  counting the  day  your spouse was served)  and mark that day  on a  calendar.  

On  that  day,  if  you  have  not  received  an  Answer  from  your  spouse,  complete  the 

Affidavit of Default for Divorce (SCCA 400.07 SRL-DIV) and the Request for Hearing 

(SCCA 400.08 SRL-DIV).  On the Affidavit of Default for Divorce, print the month, day, 

and  year  the  Summons  and  Complaint  was  delivered.    Check  whether  the  forms  were 

served  by  personal  service,  certified  mail,  or  acceptance  of  service.    Do  not  sign  this 

form until you are in front of a notary.  The notary must witness your signature on 

the Affidavit of Default for Divorce.   

)  SERVICE BY COMMERCIAL DELIVERY SERVICE 

You may use a commercial delivery company like UPS or FedEx to serve the summons 

and  complaint.    The  company  must  be  one  approved  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service.

is  approved  at 

the  IRS  website:   

http://www.irs.gov/uac/Private-Delivery-Services-(PDS). 

The delivery company will give you a delivery record showing the date, time and place of 

delivery, the name of the person served and an original signature or electronic image of 

the  signature  of  the  person  served.    If  someone  other  than  the  defendant  signs  for  the 

documents, you will not be able to proceed if the defendant does not appear.  If delivery 

is refused or returned undelivered, you must try another method.  

You  must  provide  an  affidavit  showing  the  documents  served  with  the  delivery  record 

attached.  This affidavit and delivery record must be filed with the clerk of court.

marked “Plaintiff.”  Print your address, telephone number, and email address where requested.

name at the bottom of the form where it says “Plaintiff.”  Take the original Affidavit of Default 

for Divorce, Request for Hearing, and the Return Receipt (Green Card) to the Court and file 

them with the Clerk of Court.  Ask the Clerk of Court to make a copy of these forms for you.

spouse  agrees  with  every  paragraph  in  your  Complaint,  complete  a  Request  for  Hearing  form 

and file it with the Clerk of Court.  Ask the Clerk of Court to make a copy of this form for you.   

f  you  received  an  Answer  from  your  spouse  that  indicates  he/she  does  not  agree  with  every 

paragraph in your Complaint, then your divorce is contested and you need to hire an attorney.     

ART 3: THE HEARING   

he  Clerk  of  Court  will  inform  you  of  your  hearing  date  by  mailing  you  a  Notice  of  Hearing. 

After you receive the Notice of Hearing from the Court, you must provide a copy to your spouse 

or spouse’s attorney at least 10 days before the hearing.  The Notice of Hearing needs to be sent 

to your spouse or spouse’s attorney by certified mail, return receipt requested.

Plaintiff Simple Divorce Checklist 

-  Complete the first five forms in this packet -- Family Court Cover Sheet, Certificate of Exemption, 

Summons for Divorce, Complaint for Divorce, and the Financial Declaration Form. 

  File the five forms with the Clerk of Court in the appropriate county.

  Count thirty-five (35) days from the day your spouse was served. 

o 

o 

o 

If you do not receive an Answer, file the Affidavit of Default for Divorce, Request for Hearing, 
and the Return Receipt (Green Card) with the appropriate Clerk of Court. 
If you received an Answer and your spouse agrees with every paragraph in your Complaint, then 
file a Request for Hearing with the Clerk of Court. 
If you received an Answer and your spouse does not agree with every paragraph in your 
Complaint, then your divorce is contested and you should hire an attorney. 

-  Once you receive the Notice of Hearing from the Clerk of Court, mail a copy of this Notice to your spouse 
or spouse’s attorney (at least ten days before the hearing date).  File the Affidavit of Mailing with the 
Clerk of Court. 

  To prepare for your divorce hearing, complete the Final Order of Divorce and the Report of Divorce or 
Annulment of Marriage (DHEC Form), and ask someone who can testify that you have lived apart from 
your spouse for at least a year to serve as your witness. 

-  On the day of your hearing, you and your witness should arrive at least 30 minutes early and be sure to 

dress appropriately, turn off your cell phones, and remove your hats. Unless the judge specifically requests 
that you bring your children, it is best if you do not bring your child/children to the Court hearing. 

-  At the hearing you and your witness will testify. 

-  The judge will allow your spouse to present his/her case, and you will have an opportunity to ask your 

spouse questions. 

-  At the end of the hearing the judge will sign the Final Order for Divorce and the Form 4F. 

-  Be sure that the signed Final Order for Divorce and Form 4F is filed with the Clerk of Court’s office and 

you receive a clocked copy for your files.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
