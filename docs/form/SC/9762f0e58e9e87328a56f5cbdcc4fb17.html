      <pre>Guidelines for Declaring a Mobile Home Derelict and For Its Destruction or 
Sale 
Section 6-1-150 SC Code of Laws (Effective June 4, 2007) 

Derelict mobile home means a mobile home that is 

  Not  connected  to  electricity  or  not  connected  to  a  source  of  safe  potable  water  supply 

sufficient for normal residential needs, or both; OR  

  Not connected to a Department of Environmental Control approved wastewater disposal 

system; OR  

  Unoccupied for a period of at least 30 days and for which there is clear and convincing 
evidence that the occupant does not intend to return on a temporary or permanent basis; 
AND 

  That  is  so  damaged,  decayed,  dilapidated,  unsanitary,  unsafe,  or  vermin-infested  that  it 
creates  a  hazard  to  the  health  or  safety  of  the  occupants,  the  persons  using  the  mobile 
home, or the public. 

Landowner means the owner of real property on which a derelict mobile home is located. 
Local governing body means the governing body of a county or municipality. 
Local official means the office or agency that is responsible for inspecting or zoning property in 
a county or a municipality. 
Mobile  home  means  a  structure,  not  including  a  modular  home,  designed  for  temporary  or 
permanent  habitation  and  constructed  to  permit  its  transport  on  wheels,  temporarily  or 
permanently attached to its frame, from its place of construction or sale to a location where it is 
intended  to  be  a  housing  unit  or  a  storage  unit.    Mobile  home  includes  both  mobile  and 
manufactured homes. 

. 

Procedure  for  Landowner  to  have  mobile  home  declared  derelict,  removed,  and 
destroyed.    §§  6-1-150(B)(2)  and  29-15-10;  $80  filing  fee  required  (fee  covers  the  initial 
hearing declaring the mobile home derelict as well as the sale pursuant to § 29-15-10). 
 

Landowner  must  first  apply  to  the  local  governmental  official  to  have  the  mobile 
home  inspected.    The  local  official  must  provide  the  landowner  with  written 
confirmation  that  the  mobile  home  has  been  inspected  and  whether  it  meets  the 
criteria of derelict and removal/disposal as provided in § 6-1-150 (A) (1). 
Landowner  must  file  a  Petition  for  Removal  and  Destruction  of  Derelict  Mobile 
Home (SCCA 274) with the magistrate court to obtain an order declaring the mobile 
home derelict, and authorizing its removal and destruction. 
Magistrate  court  must  hold  a  hearing,  notifying  all  parties  concerned  (landowner, 
mobile home owner, lienholder, etc.), and make a determination on the petition.   
a.  Magistrate  court  should  first  determine  whether  a  landlord/tenant  relationship 
exists.  If so, this action must be suspended to allow a separate action for ejectment, 
if required.  After completion of ejectment, this action is recommenced. 

b. Magistrate court shall issue Order Declaring Mobile Home Derelict (SCCA 275), 

reflecting its decision on the hearing.   

4. 

Landowner  next  must  file  a  Motion  and  Affidavit  for  Abandoned  Mobile  Home 
(SCCA 269), and follow the procedures set forth in § 29-15-10(C).

a. Apply to the DMV and county auditor for the name and address of any owner or                         

lienholder.   

b. Provide written notice by certified or registered mail to any owners and lienholders 
that  the  local  official  has  determined  the  mobile  home  is  a  derelict  mobile  home 
and that there is a pending matter in the magistrates court.   

Landowner must post a sturdy, weatherproof notice on each door of the mobile home 
for 30 consecutive days reading substantially as follows:  

NOTICE 
 
This mobile home is the subject of a proceeding in the magistrates court to determine if 
it will be removed from this property.  For further information, please contact:   
(name and telephone number of landowner seeking removal) or  
(name and number of magistrates court where action is pending). 
(Date of Notice) 

In the event that the court issues an order declaring the mobile home to be derelict, 
and orders removal and destruction, the landowner shall send proof of the same to the 
county auditor pursuant to § 12-49-85(D), who shall remove the derelict mobile home 
permanently  from  the  duplicate  list.    Upon  this  removal,  unpaid  taxes,  uniform 
service charges, assessments, penalties, costs of collection, and other amounts billed 
on the tax notice, which are due as a result of the value of the derelict mobile home, 
are waived. 
The court may order costs to the prevailing party in these actions upon submission of 
an  affidavit  and  itemization  of  costs.    The  costs  of  removal  and  disposal  are  the 
responsibility of the owner of the derelict mobile home and may be waived only by 
order of the magistrate court or if a local governing body has a program that covers 
removal and disposal costs.  A lienholder is not responsible for the costs of removal 
and disposal unless the lienholder or his agent affects a recovery of the mobile home 
under its lien and subsequently knowingly abandons the mobile home on the property 
and  allows  the  same  to  become  a  derelict  mobile  home.  A  landowner  who  is  the 
owner  of  the  derelict  mobile  home  and  is  unwilling  or  unable  to  pay  the  costs  of 
removal and disposal, a lien for the costs of removal and disposal may be placed on 
the landowner’s real property where the derelict mobile home was located.   

.   

Procedure for Landowner to have mobile home removed and sold.  §§ 6-1-150(B)(1) 

and 29-15-10; $35 filing fee required. 
 

    B

1.  Landowner does not have to have the mobile home declared derelict. 
2.  Landowner must file a Motion and Affidavit for Abandoned Mobile Home (SCCA 269) 

and follow the procedures set forth in § 29-15-10(C): 

a.  Apply to the DMV and county auditor for the name and address of any owner or 

lienholder.   

b.  Provide  written  notice  by  certified  or  registered  mail  to  any  owners  and 
lienholders  that  the  local  official  has  determined  the  mobile  home  is  a  derelict 
mobile home and that there is a pending matter in the magistrate court.

home.  A final hearing should be held on the matter, with notice given to all interested 
parties (landowner, mobile home owner, lienholder, etc.).  The determination on the 
matter  shall  be  reflected  in  the  Court's  issuance  of  Order  for  Removal  and 
Sale/Destruction  of  Derelict  Mobile  Home  (SCCA  276).    The  Court  then  holds  a 
public  sale  of  the  mobile  home,  culminating  in  the  issuance  of  an  Order  of  Sale
