      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE  
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT CHILD SUPPORT 
DECREASE PACKET 
 
DEFENDANT 

he Plaintiff is the person who is trying to decrease the child support.  The Plaintiff is the person 

who wants things to change and who has filed this case.  The Defendant is the person who is 
being sued.  The instructions in this packet are for the Defendant.  

 

WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before filing 
any legal matter. This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing themselves in court. If you proceed without an attorney, it may negatively affect 
your legal rights. If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your legal rights, consult an attorney. Please note that clerks of court, court staff, and judges 
cannot give you legal advice. 

ISCLAIMER:  The information in this packet is not legal advice and cannot replace the 
advice of competent legal counsel licensed in your state. Child support laws vary from state to 
state and the information contained in this packet is specific to South Carolina. Please note that 
the information contained in this packet is subject to change and make sure that you have the 
most current version of this packet before filing. 

ART 1:  YOUR ROLE AS A DEFENDANT 

he following instructions will help you file an Answer for a child support reduction in South 

Carolina pro se, or without an attorney.  Pro se is a Latin term meaning “in person” or “on one’s 

own behalf.”  As the courts see more people representing themselves in court, you may also hear 

the term self-represented litigant instead of pro se.  While the self-represented litigant may not 

incur the attorney expense, the self-represented litigant does not have the expert guidance that an 

attorney can provide. 

f you do not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South Carolina Bar’s 

Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a Family Law attorney in your county.   

Members of the South Carolina Bar’s Lawyer Referral Service have been in practice for more 

than 3 years, are in good standing, have provided proof of malpractice insurance, and have 

agreed to provide a 30 minute consultation for no more than $50.  If you believe you qualify for 

SCCA 400.2D SRL-CSM (8/2012)

South Carolina Legal Services, you may contact their Legal Aid Telephone Intake Service at 1-

of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. 

he noncustodial party who is the Plaintiff in this case has filed for a reduction in child support 

payments.  You will be served these documents in one of three ways: 

  By Certified U.S. Mail, Return Receipt Requested, Restricted Delivery; or 

  By receiving the Summons and Complaint from the noncustodial party and voluntarily 

signing an Acceptance of Service; or 

  By a law enforcement officer or private process server. 

Is your case handled by the South Carolina Department of Social Services, Child Support 
Enforcement Division? 

If your child support order is handled by DSS, you should immediately contact the office 

handling your case and give them a copy of the paperwork that was served on you.  If you don’t 

know which office handles your case, you can go to the DSS Child Support website and see 

which counties are handled by which office. Their website address is 

http://www.state.sc.us/dss/csed/contact.htm#region.  

If your case is a “private” case that is not handled by DSS, you must file an 

Answer within 30 days after you receive a Summons and Complaint.  

You may want to talk to an attorney about your options.  If you do 

not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South 

Carolina Bar’s Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a 

Family Law attorney in your county.  

ART 2: COMPLETING YOUR PAPERWORK

The following forms are included in this packet:  

1.  Defendant’s Answer (SCCA 400.24 SRL-CSM) 

2.  Financial Declaration Form (SCCA 430) 

3.  Affidavit of Service by Mailing (Answer) (SCCA 400.25 SRL-CSM) 

Read all the documents carefully.  If you are willing to accept service, complete the Acceptance 

of Service form and return it to the Plaintiff.  Next, read the Complaint carefully and complete 

the Answer to the best of your abilities.  At the end of the Answer there is a space where you can 

ask the Court for additional relief.  You may leave this blank.  If you want to ask for an increase 

instead of a decrease, you can use these lines to ask this.  You will have to prove that there 

should be an increase and not a decrease. Before you ask for an increase, you should check the 

child support guidelines.  Child support is calculated by using the South Carolina Child Support 

Guidelines. Go to the South Carolina Department of Social Services website and complete the 

child support calculator. The DSS website is http://www.state.sc.us/dss/csed/calculator.htm.  

 The results of the child support calculator do not guarantee that a Family Court 

Judge will increase your child support amount.  

f you get a lower support amount when using the calculator, you may decide not to file for an 

increase in your support amount.  

 

The judge may decrease the child support amount if the results of the child 

support calculator show that there should be a decrease instead of an increase. 

lease pay special attention to the Financial Declaration Form.  This form asks questions about 

the finances of both you and the Plaintiff.  Fill out the sections of the form that apply to you.  

You must take the Financial Declaration Form to a notary public before you sign it.  After the 

Answer and Financial Declaration Form are completed, make two copies of each form.

Mailing with the Clerk of Court and keep one copy for your files.

date and time of your hearing.  On the day of your hearing, you should arrive at the courthouse at 

least thirty (30) minutes prior to your scheduled time and bring a copy of your paperwork.  Dress 

appropriately and turn off your cell phone.  Appropriate dress includes suits, jackets, dresses, 

or dress slacks.  Males should tuck their shirts into their pants. Casual clothing such as sweat 

clothes, tank tops, shorts, and similar summer beach wear is not appropriate for the courtroom.  

Remove hats when entering the courtroom, unless they are required for a medical condition.  

Most courts do not allow children into the courtroom so make arrangements for a responsible 

adult to watch your children while you are in court.  

he Plaintiff will present his/her case first.  You will have the opportunity to ask the Plaintiff and 

any witnesses questions.  After the Plaintiff and witnesses have testified, you will be given an 

opportunity to testify and present witnesses for your case.  If you completed the Counterclaim 

section of the Answer and asked for something else, you must prove that your request should be 

granted.  The judge may interrupt you from time to time to ask you a question.  Listen carefully, 

and answer the questions the judge asks you. If you have any papers that you want the Judge to 

see, hand the original and a copy to the Deputy Sheriff who will give the original to the Judge 

and a copy to the Plaintiff.  After the hearing, the judge will sign the order. The Clerk of Court 

will provide you and the Defendant or the Defendant’s attorney with a copy of the order.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
