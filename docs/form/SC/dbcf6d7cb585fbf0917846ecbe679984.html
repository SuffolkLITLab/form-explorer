      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE  
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT CHILD SUPPORT 
INCREASE PACKET 
 
PLAINTIFF  
 
The Plaintiff is the person who is trying to increase the child support.  The Plaintiff is the person 
who wants things to change and who has filed this case.  The Defendant is the person who is 
being sued.  The instructions in this packet are for the Plaintiff.  

WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before filing 
any legal matter. This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing themselves in court. If you proceed without an attorney, it may negatively affect 
your legal rights. If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your legal rights, consult an attorney. Please note that clerks of court, court staff, and judges 
cannot give you legal advice. 

ISCLAIMER:  The information in this packet is not legal advice and cannot replace the 
advice of competent legal counsel licensed in your state. Child support laws vary from state to 
state and the information contained in this packet is specific to South Carolina. Please note that 
the information contained in this packet is subject to change and make sure that you have the 
most current version of this packet before filing.

he following instructions will help you file for a child support increase in South Carolina pro 

se, or without an attorney.  Pro se is a Latin term meaning “in person” or “on one’s own behalf.”  

As the courts see more people representing themselves in court, you may also hear the term self-

represented litigant instead of pro se.  While the self-represented litigant may not incur the 

attorney expense, the self-represented litigant does not have the expert guidance that an attorney 

can provide. 

    
If you do not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South Carolina Bar’s 

Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a Family Law attorney in your county.   

Members of the South Carolina Bar’s Lawyer Referral Service have been in practice for more 

than 3 years, are in good standing, have provided proof of malpractice insurance, and have 

agreed to provide a 30 minute consultation for no more than $50.  If you believe you qualify for 

South Carolina Legal Services, you may contact their Legal Aid Telephone Intake Service at 1-

of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. 

EFORE YOU FILE 

s your order from South Carolina?   

nce South Carolina issues a child support order, South Carolina is the only state that can 

change the order as long as you, the Defendant, or the child still lives in South Carolina.   

s your order from another state?   

f another state issued the order and you, the Defendant, or the child still lives in that state, the 

paperwork for an increase must be filed in that other state.  You may want to contact the 

administrative offices of the court in that state to determine if they have similar paperwork you 

can file.  Information about other states may be available on http://www.lawhelp.org.   

id you and the Defendant have another child? 

You should not use this packet if you would like an increase because you and the Defendant 

have another child who was not included in the original child support order.  You may contact 

the Department of Social Services Child Support Enforcement Division or an attorney. 

Have you checked the child support guidelines?  

Child support is calculated by using the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines. Go to the 

South Carolina Department of Social Services website and complete the child support calculator. 

The DSS website is http://www.state.sc.us/dss/csed/calculator.htm.  

he South Carolina Department of Social Services Child Support Enforcement Division 

considers a change of circumstances substantial when the new child support amount is 20% 

more than the old amount.  This may be hard to know before you begin your action as the 

Defendant’s income is also considered in the child support calculation.  Judges do not have to 

follow this 20% standard, but many use it as a reasonable guide.

 The results of the child support calculator do not guarantee that a Family Court 

Judge will increase your child support amount.  

f you get a lower support amount when using the calculator, you may decide not to file for an 

increase in your support amount. If you file an action for an increase, the Defendant can file a 

counterclaim and ask for a reduction.   

The judge may decrease the child support amount if the results of the child 

support calculator show that there should be a decrease instead of an increase. 

o get an increase you must show a substantial change of circumstances.  Some common 

examples are: 

the needs of the child(ren) have increased 
the Defendant’s income has increased 

  change in day care costs for children in the support order 
 
 
  you lost your job through no fault of your own 
  you make substantially less than you did when you the child support order was issued 
  a medical condition or disability that prevents or limits your ability to work  
  you and the Defendant have had another child 
  you and the Defendant have a child who has moved in with you 

 

To show a substantial change of circumstances, you will have to provide proof of the changes.  

The following chart lists some examples that you can use in court for evidence. 

If you… 
 
lost your job through no fault of your own 
 

have become disabled 

have increased child care costs 

increased child needs 

bring 3 copies of these to court:  

job applications, information from One Stop, 
rejection letters, or other proof 

applications for social security assistance, 
social security insurance, or veterans benefits; 
medical evidence from your doctor 
day care bills and expenses 
documentation of medical costs, proof of other 
expenses

signs the order.  You should take a large brown envelope with enough postage to mail everything 

back to you.  The envelope should be addressed to you.  You will receive the envelope in the

and must try again.

DSS, record the docket number you received from the Clerk of Court and the words 

“Summons and Complaint” across the top of the return receipt (green card) and then

you are in front of a notary.  The notary must witness your signature on the 

Affidavit of Mailing. Attach the return receipt card (green card) to the notarized 

Affidavit of Mailing and take it to the Clerk of Court’s office for filing.   

f you do not get the return receipt card (green card) back, you may try to re-send all the 

documents again by Certified Mail, Restricted Delivery, Return Receipt Requested.  If 

you do not believe this would be successful, you may have to call your local Sheriff’s 

office to serve the papers on the Defendant or DSS.  There may be a fee for this service 

by the Sheriff’s office.  If your Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis was granted, 

provide a copy to the Sheriff’s office.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
