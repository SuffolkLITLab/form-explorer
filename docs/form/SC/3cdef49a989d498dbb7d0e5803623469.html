      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE  
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT VISITATION 
PACKET 
 
DEFENDANT 
 

The Plaintiff is the parent who wants visitation and files the case with the Court. The Defendant 
is the other parent or person with custody of the child or children, also known as the custodial 
party.  The instructions in this packet are for the Defendant.  

 

WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before filing 
any legal matter.  This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing themselves in court.  If you proceed without an attorney, it may negatively affect 
your legal rights.  If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your legal rights, please consult an attorney. Please note that clerks of court, court staff, and 
judges may give you information about the court and its procedures but cannot give you legal 
advice.  

ISCLAIMER: The information in this packet is not legal advice and cannot replace the advice 
of competent legal counsel licensed in your state.  Visitation laws vary from state to state and the 
information contained in this packet is specific to South Carolina.  Please note that the 
information contained in this packet is subject to change.  Before filing, make sure that you have 
the most current version at www.sccourts.org. 

he information in this packet is intended for use by parents seeking visitation and is not 
intended for use by grandparents or other relatives seeking visitation.  It is recommended 
that a grandparent or other relative seek advice from an attorney to seek visitation.      

he following instructions will help you file an Answer for visitation in South Carolina without 
an attorney.  This is called pro se or self-represented litigant (SRL).  While the self-represented 
litigant may not incur the attorney expense, someone acting without an attorney does not have 
the expert guidance that an attorney can provide.  The other party may choose to hire an attorney.  
Depending on the outcome, you may be required to pay the other party's attorney's fees and 
costs. 

f you do not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South Carolina Bar's 
Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a Family Law attorney in your county.  
Members of the South Carolina Bar's Lawyer Referral Service have been in practice for more 
than 3 years, are in good standing, have provided proof of malpractice insurance, and have 
agreed to provide a 30 minute consultation for no more than $50.  If you cannot afford an 
attorney, you may contact South Carolina Legal Services (SCLS) through the Legal Aid 
Telephone Intake Service at 1-888-346-5592.  Please note that to qualify for a legal aid attorney 
through SCLS, your income must not be more than 125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
