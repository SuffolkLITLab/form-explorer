      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE  
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT REQUEST FOR 
VISITATION PACKET 
 
PLAINTIFF  

he Plaintiff is the parent who wants visitation and files the case with the Court. The Defendant 
is the other parent or person with custody of the child or children, also called the custodial party.  
The instructions in this packet are for the Plaintiff.  

ARNING: You are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before filing 
any legal matter.  This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing themselves in court.  If you proceed without an attorney, it may negatively affect 
your legal rights. If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your legal rights, please consult an attorney.  Please note that clerks of court, court staff, and 
judges may give you information about the court and its procedures but cannot give you legal 
advice.  

ISCLAIMER: The information in this packet is not legal advice and cannot replace the advice 
of competent legal counsel licensed in your state. Visitation laws vary from state to state and the 
information contained in this packet is specific to South Carolina.  Please note that the 
information contained in this packet is subject to change.  Before filing, make sure that you have 
the most current version at www.sccourts.org. 

he information in this packet is intended for use by parents seeking visitation and is not 
intended for use by grandparents or other relatives seeking visitation.  It is recommended 
that a grandparent or other relative seek advice from an attorney to seek visitation.      
  
The following instructions will help you file for visitation in South Carolina without an attorney.  
This is called pro se or self-represented litigant (SRL).  While the self-represented litigant may 
not incur the attorney expense, someone acting without an attorney does not have the expert 
guidance that an attorney can provide.  The other party may choose to hire an attorney.  If your 
visitation request is denied, you could be required to pay the other party's attorney's fees and 
costs.  

f you do not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South Carolina Bar's 
Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a Family Law attorney in your county.  
Members of the South Carolina Bar's Lawyer Referral Service have been in practice for more 
than 3 years, are in good standing, have provided proof of malpractice insurance, and have 
agreed to provide a 30 minute consultation for no more than $50.  If you cannot afford an 
attorney, you may contact South Carolina Legal Services (SCLS) through the Legal Aid 
Telephone Intake Service at 1-888-346-5592.  Please note that to qualify for a legal aid attorney 
through SCLS, your income must not be more than 125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.

PART 1: BEFORE YOU FILE 
 

You are strongly encouraged to speak with an attorney if 
your name is on a child abuse registry, sex offender 
registry, or if there is currently a restraining order or 
bench warrant out against you. 

oes your child(ren) currently live in South Carolina?   

he information in this packet only applies to those seeking visitation with child(ren) who live in 

South Carolina.  Generally, the child(ren) must have lived in South Carolina for the past six 
months.  If your child(ren) is in South Carolina, you must file for visitation in the county where 
the child(ren) lives. 

s there already a court order for visitation?   

he forms in this packet are for someone who is asking the court to establish visitation.  They are 

not the right forms if you already have a court order and want to change the visitation schedule. 

f you already have a court order and the custodial party is not following the visitation schedule 
or not allowing you to visit the child(ren), you may want to contact an attorney or the Clerk of 
Court in the county where your order is for more information.  

f you are the father and have questions about paternity, see the Frequently Asked 
Questions for Paternity on the Self-Help Resources page. 
 

Filing these papers and having a hearing does not mean 
you will get visitation.  The Judge will decide.  The 
custodial party may ask for child support even if the 
Judge denies your request for visitation.

Some of the information on each form will be the same, such as your name and address, but each 
form has a different purpose and requires different information. Some of your documents will 
have to be notarized.  This means that a notary must watch you sign the documents and provide 
the notary's seal. You will need to bring picture identification.  You can find a notary at a bank, 
funeral home, post office, or courthouse.  The notary may charge no more than $5 per form (cash 
only).  Below is an image of a notary block.  If you see this on a form, it must be notarized. 
 

It is important that you make copies of all paperwork.  Keep the copies of the paperwork in a 
safe place and bring your copy to court with you.  If any necessary information is missing, you 
risk your case being dismissed or delayed.  If your case is dismissed, you may have to begin 
again by filing your information with the Clerk of Court a second time and paying the filing fee 
of $150.00 again.

the caption. Print your full name, address, email address (if you have an email address), and a 
reliable phone number.

Family Court Coversheet.  If you are filing in one of these counties, you are required to 
participate in mediation.  There may be a fee for mediation.

process often helps the case move more quickly.  Also, it teaches the parents how to work out 
problems.  When the parents can work together to solve problems, the child(ren) feel less stress.

Financial Declaration 

he Financial Declaration (SCCA 430) asks questions about the finances of both parties.  Only 
fill out the sections of the form that apply to you.  Attach a copy of your most recent pay stub or 
benefits statement.  Fill in your gross monthly income.  This is the amount of money you earn 
before taxes, social security, or any deductions are taken out.  When figuring your monthly 
income and expenses, multiply any weekly amounts by 4.33 to get the monthly amount.  Do not 
sign this form until you are in front of a notary public.  The notary must watch you sign the form.   

ompleting the Filing Process  

he next step is to file the papers with the appropriate Clerk of Court, Family Court Division, 

and to pay the filing fee ($150), if applicable.  You will file this in the county where your 
child(ren) lives.  Physical locations of all South Carolina Family Courts can be found on pages 
12-13 of these instructions, in the telephone book, or online at www.sccourts.org. 
   
Make two copies of the entire packet.  Take the copies and the originals to the Clerk of Court in 
the county where your child(ren) lives.  If you are paying the fee, the Clerk of Court will: (1) 
assign your case a docket number; (2) record the docket number on the upper right hand corner 
of all of the forms; (3) keep the originals; and (4) return two copies of the forms to you.  The 
Clerk will keep the original and return two clocked copies to you.  One copy is for you to keep.  
The other copy is to serve on the Defendant. 

t is important that you print the docket number that has been issued for your case on all future 
forms you file with the court.   

he filing fee is $150.  You cannot pay with a personal check, credit or debit card; you can pay 

with cash, a bank check, or a money order.  

f you cannot afford the filing fee, then you can file the Motion and Affidavit to Proceed In 
Forma Pauperis.  You will not have to pay to file, but you may have to pay the fee after the 
Judge reviews your information and signs the Order.  You should take a large brown envelope 
with enough postage to mail everything back to you.  The envelope should be addressed to you.  
You will receive the envelope in the mail in about two weeks.  Look at the Motion and Affidavit 
to Proceed In Forma Pauperis.  If the box at the bottom marked "granted" is checked, your 
documents should have a date stamp and a docket number on them.  Now you can serve the 
papers on the Defendant.   

f the motion is denied, you must pay the filing fee ($150) and other fees by the date set by the court.  
If the fee is not paid on or before that date, your case will be dismissed, and you will have to begin 
the process again by re-filing your information.

STEP 2: SERVICE OF PROCESS 
 

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. If you do not 
serve these papers correctly, you may not be able to 
proceed. 

 

There are two steps for service of process.  

(1) Serve the Defendant with one clocked copy of the Family Court Coversheet, Summons, 

Complaint (Visitation), and the Financial Declaration.  
(2) Prove to the court the Defendant was properly served.  

ou must serve the Defendant in one of five ways.  If one way is not successful, try another one.  

The most effective way to serve the Defendant is through the Sheriff's Office or by private 
process server.  There will be a fee for this service.   
 

1) SHERIFF'S OFFICE 

ontact the Sheriff's office in the county where the Defendant lives or works to serve the 
papers.  There will be a fee for this service.  When the Sheriff serves the papers you filed 
with the court, ask the office to complete the bottom half of the Affidavit of Service 
(SCCA 402F) form before a notary, have the form notarized, and return the form to you.  
Many Sheriff's Offices use their own Affidavit of Service Form.  File the Affidavit of 
Service with the Clerk of Court.  Keep a copy for your own file. 

) PRIVATE PROCESS SERVER 

rivate process servers are listed in the telephone book and online.  There will be a fee 
for this service.  It is usually more expensive than the Sheriff's Office.  Give the process 
server the Affidavit of Service (SCCA 402F) from this packet, along with the papers you 
filed with the court.  The process server will give you the completed Affidavit of Service 
Form or their own form after they have served the papers.  File the Affidavit of Service 
with the Clerk of Court. Keep a copy for your own file. 

)  SERVICE BY COMMERCIAL DELIVERY SERVICE 

You may use a commercial delivery company like UPS or FedEx to serve the papers you 
filed with the court.  The company must be one approved by the Internal Revenue 
Service.  You may check to be sure the company is approved at the IRS website:    
https://www.irs.gov/uac/Private-Delivery-Services-PDS   

You need the delivery record.  The delivery record will show the date, time and place of 
delivery, the name of the person served and will have an original signature or electronic 
image of the signature of the person served.  If someone other than the Defendant signs 
for the documents, you will not be able to proceed if the Defendant does not appear.  If 
delivery is refused or returned undelivered, you must try another method.  You can get a

copy of the delivery record at the delivery company's office, by calling the delivery 
company, or going online and printing a copy.  You will need the tracking number that is 
printed on your receipt.  

Complete an Affidavit of Service By Mailing (SCCA 400.43 SRL-VIS) showing the 
documents served with the delivery record attached.  Do not sign the Affidavit of Service 
By Mailing form until you are in front of a notary public.  The notary must watch you 
sign the form.  This affidavit and delivery record must be filed with the Clerk of Court.  
Keep a copy for your own file.  

ou may use U.S. Mail.  If you do, you must send these documents Certified Mail, 

Restricted Delivery, Return Receipt Requested.   

hen you get the return receipt card (green card) back from the U.S. Post Office, check 

it to make sure the Defendant signed the card.  If anyone other than the Defendant 
signed the return receipt card (green card), you do not have good service and must 
try again. 

If you receive the return receipt card (green card) and it was signed by the Defendant, 
record the docket number you received from the Clerk of Court and the words "Summons 
and Complaint" across the top of the return receipt (green card) and then make a copy of 
the card for your file.   

ext, complete and sign the Affidavit of Service by Mailing form (SCCA 400.43 SRL-
VIS) before a notary.  Do not sign this form until you are in front of a notary.  The 
notary must watch you sign the Affidavit of Service by Mailing.  Attach the return 
receipt card (green card) to the notarized Affidavit of Service by Mailing and take it to 
the Clerk of Court's office for filing.

) ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICE  

f the Defendant is willing to accept service, have the Defendant complete the 
Acceptance of Service Form (SCCA 400.42 SRL-VIS).  Handing the papers to the 
Defendant yourself is not good service of process unless the Defendant is willing and 
completes the acceptance form.  Take the completed form to the Clerk of Court's office

company letterhead or printed from your company's website.  This will be used to show the 
Judge when you are not working and can visit with the child(ren).  This is especially 
important if you work a swing shift or work weekends.  If you have any papers that you want 
the Judge to see, hand the original and a copy to the Courtroom Deputy who will give the 
original to the Judge and a copy to the Defendant.  Be sure to keep another copy for yourself in 
case the Judge or the Defendant asks you questions about it.

The Judge may stop you from time to time to ask a question.  Listen carefully and answer the 
questions the Judge asks you.  The Defendant or the Defendant's attorney has the right to ask you 
questions, called cross-examination.  When you are finished testifying, the Judge will indicate 
that you may leave the witness stand or sit down at the table.  The Defendant will have a chance 
to testify as well, and you will have a chance to ask the Defendant questions.  At the end of the 
hearing, the Judge may tell you the decision or state that a decision will come later.   

f the judge grants your request at the hearing, the Judge will likely sign the Order (Visitation).  
You may ask the Deputy to hand the Judge the order to finish completing.  Make sure the Order 
(Visitation) is filed with the Clerk of Court. 

he Clerk of Court will provide you and the Defendant or the Defendant's attorney with a 

clocked copy of the Order (Visitation).  If the Judge does not sign the Order at the hearing, the 
Judge will give the signed Order to the Clerk, and the Clerk will mail a copy to you and to the 
Defendant. 
 

   
The Order must be signed by the Judge and filed with the 
Clerk of Court before you have the scheduled visitation.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
