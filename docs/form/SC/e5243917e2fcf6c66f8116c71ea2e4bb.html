DECREASE PACKET 
 
PLAINTIFF  

he Plaintiff is the person who is trying to decrease the child support.  The Plaintiff is the person 

who wants things to change and who has filed this case.  The Defendant is the person who is 
being sued.  The instructions in this packet are for the Plaintiff.  

WARNING: You are strongly encouraged to seek the advice of an attorney before filing 
any legal matter. This packet is designed to provide information and forms to people who are 
representing themselves in court. If you proceed without an attorney, it may negatively affect 
your legal rights. If you are unsure whether to proceed, or have questions about these forms or 
your legal rights, consult an attorney. Please note that clerks of court, court staff, and judges 
cannot give you legal advice. 

ISCLAIMER:  The information in this packet is not legal advice and cannot replace the 
advice of competent legal counsel licensed in your state. Child support laws vary from state to 
state and the information contained in this packet is specific to South Carolina. Please note that 
the information contained in this packet is subject to change and make sure that you have the 
most current version of this packet before filing. 

he following instructions will help you file for a child support reduction in South Carolina pro 

se, or without an attorney.  Pro se is a Latin term meaning “in person” or “on one’s own behalf.”  

As the courts see more people representing themselves in court, you may also hear the term self-

represented litigant instead of pro se.  While the self-represented litigant may not incur the 

attorney expense, the self-represented litigant does not have the expert guidance that an attorney 

can provide. 

You may want to consult an attorney if you have a large arrearage or a bench 
warrant.  

f you do not know an attorney who can assist you, you may call the South Carolina Bar’s 

Lawyer Referral Service at 1-800-868-2284 and ask for a Family Law attorney in your county.   

Members of the South Carolina Bar’s Lawyer Referral Service have been in practice for more 

than 3 years, are in good standing, have provided proof of malpractice insurance, and have 

agreed to provide a 30 minute consultation for no more than $50.  If you believe you qualify for

nce South Carolina issues a child support order, South Carolina is the only state that can 

change the order as long as you, the custodial party, or the child still lives in South Carolina.   

s your order from another state?   

f another state issued the order and you, the custodial party, or the child still lives in that state, 

the paperwork for a reduction must be filed in that other state.  You may want to contact the 

administrative offices of the court in that state to determine if they have similar paperwork you 

can file.  Information about other states may be available on http://www.lawhelp.org.   

Have you checked the child support guidelines?  

Child support is calculated by using the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines. Go to the 

South Carolina Department of Social Services website and complete the child support calculator. 

The DSS website is http://www.state.sc.us/dss/csed/calculator.htm.  

Minimum wage for a full-time job is the lowest wage that is generally used to set the 

child support obligation.  If your child support order was based on minimum 

wage, it is unlikely that the Family Court Judge will reduce your child support 

unless there is some other substantial change of circumstances. 

The results of the child support calculator do not guarantee that a Family Court 
Judge will lower your child support obligation.  

If you get a higher support obligation when using the calculator, you may decide not to file a 

reduction in your support obligation. If you file an action for a reduction, the custodial party can 

file a counterclaim and ask for an increase.   

The judge may increase your support obligation if the results of the child support

o get a reduction you must show a substantial change of circumstances.  Some common 

examples are: 

order 

  you lost your job through no fault of your own 

  you make substantially less than you did when you were placed under the child support 

  one or more of the children from the original order now live with you 

  a medical condition or disability that prevents or limits your ability to work 

  one or more of the children may be emancipated.  Normally, children are considered 

emancipated when they have married, joined the military, or are eighteen years old and 

are out of high school.  See http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t63c003.php.   

  

 

Many Family Court Judges will not consider having additional children with 

another partner to be a substantial change of circumstances for a reduction.   

calculator show that there should be an increase instead of a decrease. 

f you have lost your job, you will need to show the judge you are looking for a job to request a 

support reduction.  You will need evidence such as copies of job applications, information from 

One Stop, rejection letters, or any other proof that you may have. 

f you have become disabled, you will need to show the judge that you have applied for or 

receive some type of disability benefits (SSA, SSI, VA, etc.). You may need medical evidence 

such as a statement from your doctor that shows that you are disabled and cannot work.   

he South Carolina Department of Social Services Child Support Enforcement Division 

considers a change of circumstances substantial when the new child support amount is 20% less 

than the old amount.  This may be hard to know before you begin your action as the custodial 

party’s income is also considered in the child support calculation.  Judges do not have to follow 

this 20% standard, but many use it as a reasonable guide.

Is your case handled by the South Carolina Department of Social Services, Child Support 
Enforcement Division? 

If your child support order is handled by DSS, you may request a review with that office instead 

of filing these papers with the court.  You must send a written request to DSS by certified mail. 

You will need to include information showing how your circumstances have changed and 

financial information supporting the reduction.  You need to keep a copy of your written request 

and the proof that you sent it by certified mail.   

If DSS does not object to the reduction, they will file the action for reduction and schedule a 

hearing.  If DSS does object to the reduction, DSS must advise you that you may file an action 

in Family Court to have the support amount reviewed. 

Child support cases that are not handled by DSS are called “private cases.”  You may use this 

packet to file a court action for modification of these cases.

ake two copies of the entire packet.  Take the copies and the originals to the Clerk of Court in 

the county where you pay support.  If you are paying the fee, the Clerk of Court will:  (1) assign 

your case a docket number; (2) record the docket number on the upper right hand corner of all of 

the forms; (3) keep the originals; and (4) return two copies of the forms to you.  The clerk will 

keep the original and return two clocked copies to you.  One copy is for you to keep.  The other 

copy is to serve on the Defendant.

forms you file with the court.  Only bring cash, a cashier’s check, or money order for the filing 

fee ($150).  Do not bring a personal check.

to file but may have to pay the fee after the Judge reviews your information and signs the order.

The envelope should be addressed to you.  You will receive the envelope in the mail in about 

two weeks.  Look at the Motion and Affidavit to Proceed in Forma Pauperis.  If the box at the 

bottom marked “granted” is checked, your documents should have a date stamp and a docket 

number on them.  Now you can serve the papers on the Defendant.

or DSS, record the docket number you received from the Clerk of Court and the words 

“Summons and Complaint” across the top of the return receipt (green card) and then 

make a copy of the card for your file.  Next, complete and sign the Affidavit of Service 

by Mailing form (SCCA 400.23 SRL-CSM) before a notary.  Do not sign this form until 

you are in front of a notary.  The notary must witness your signature on the

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
