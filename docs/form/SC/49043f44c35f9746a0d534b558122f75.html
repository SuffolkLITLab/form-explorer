      <pre>COURT REPORTER MANUAL 

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

South Carolina Court Administration 

As approved August 16, 2011 
(Amended March 1, 2017) 
(Updated May 1, 2018) 

           

                   

THIS MANUAL IS ISSUED PURSUANT TO ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT. 
IT SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUSLY-ISSUED MANUALS. THE STANDARDS OF 
CONDUCT OF ALL COURT REPORTERS IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM ARE ESTABLISHED BY THIS MANUAL.  VIOLATIONS OF 
THESE STANDARDS ARE SUBJECT TO THE COURT’S CONTEMPT POWERS. 

 

 

                         

 

1 

I. 

PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 

The  purpose  of  any  court  reporting  system  is  to  create  a  timely,  accurate, 

verbatim  record  of  lower  court  proceedings  which  may  be  transcribed  for  use  in 

subsequent proceedings. 

This manual provides court reporters employed by the South Carolina Judicial 

Department (“Department” or “Court Administration”) with a workable, day-to-day 

guide for the proper conduct of court reporting. The manual also includes all required 

forms.  See Appendix 1 and § II(A).  It is intended to be a comprehensive, consistent, 

and clear-cut description of roles, responsibilities and duties of state court reporters. 

Because it is meant to be a user’s manual, comments and suggestions for 

improvement will be appreciated.  Such comments or suggestions should be directed 

to  Court  Administration.  As  the  court  reporters'  responsibilities  and  duties  may 

change from time to time, the Department reserves the right to revise the contents 

of  this  manual,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  keep  abreast  of  such  changes.  Each  court 

reporter is required to become thoroughly familiar with the content and to actively 

apply this manual to his/her daily work. 

The  willful  failure  of  a  court  reporter  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  this 

manual may constitute contempt of court enforceable by Order of the Supreme Court.

II. 

COURT REPORTER CONDUCT, DUTIES, ROLES AND RELATIONSHIPS. 

A. 

Court Administration and Court Reporters 

Court  Administration  shares  with  the  judges  the  responsibility  for  the 

supervision of court reporters. Court Administration is the primary point of contact 

for court reporters and serves as the liaison between the South Carolina Supreme 

Court and the court reporters. 

Court reporters are required to submit forms and reports online in the Court 

Reporter Transcript Tracking System to Court Administration for use in assignment 

of court reporters and for submission to the Chief Justice. Effective May 15, 2018, 

court reporters are required to email copies of all correspondence related to transcript 

orders  to  transcripts@sccourts.org,  and  beginning  on  that  date,  all  transcript 

extension  requests  are  to  be  made  by  emailing  a  completed  Notice  of  Request  for 

Extension form to extensionrequest@sccourts.org. 

B. 

Judge and Court Reporter 

The  Circuit  and  Family  Court  judges,  along  with  Court  Administration,  are 

responsible  for  the  supervision  of  court  reporters.  A  court  reporter  is  primarily 

accountable to the judge to whom he/she is assigned during a particular assignment. 

Court reporters must conform to each judge’s courtroom schedules. The court 

         

 

 

 

 

3 

reporter can best support the judicial process and the judge by remaining alert and 

prepared at all times. 

 

 

 

 

C. 

Court Reporter Conduct, Demeanor, and Appearance 

1. 

Court Reporter Conduct 

A court reporter is always a neutral, third party observer to proceedings in the 

courtroom.  A  court  reporter  must  pay  attention  throughout  the  proceeding,  show 

respect  to  all  participants,  refrain  from  gossip,  and  not  be  influenced  by  personal 

attitudes. A court reporter’s demeanor in the courthouse should be professional at 

all times. The court reporter must never attempt to influence a trial. 

A court reporter, like any other court employee, should be aware of the need for 

good  public  relations  and  thus  should  make  every  attempt  to  work  efficiently  and 

cooperatively with all people who come into contact with the judicial system. Court 

reporters  should  always  maintain  the  dignity  of  the  judicial  process.  The 

conscientious court reporter sets a model by example and is a constructive force for 

improvement of the image of the entire judicial process. 

Court reporters are expected to conduct themselves in a businesslike manner 

at all times. The performance and demeanor of the court reporter reflects not only 

on the reporter but on the judicial system. 

2. 

Dress Code 

 

4 

 

 

 

All court reporters are required to dress in a professional manner.  Business 

attire must be worn at all times in the courthouse. 

3. 

Promptness 

Court  reporters  are  required  to  arrive  at  work  early  enough  to  set  up  all 

equipment  and  to  prepare  properly  for  court.  If  unavoidably  detained,  the  court 

reporter must notify the clerk of court or the judge to whom he/she is assigned. 

4. 

“Sound Discipline” 

Court reporters are expected to maintain “sound discipline” in the courtroom. 

Unfortunately, the acoustics are not what they should be in all courtrooms. When 

understanding a witness or an attorney is difficult, the court reporter should indicate 

this to the judge and ask that the judge instruct the party to speak louder and more 

distinctly.  The  word  "inaudible"  has  no  place  in  a  transcript.  However,  unless  the 

accuracy of the record is in jeopardy, the court reporter should remain silent during 

proceedings;  except,  for  example,  to  clarify  exhibit  numbers  or  perform  requested 

read backs. 

5. 

Necessary Recesses 

Court reporters need to take an occasional brief recess, particularly in lengthy 

proceedings. If the court reporter finds that he/she cannot continue, he/she should 

feel  free  to  ask  the  presiding  judge  for  a  recess.  Prior  to  taking  a  recess  the  court 

reporter should ensure all tapes and court records are secure. 

D. 

Duties 

 

5 

The family court reporter serves primarily the family court, which has limited 

jurisdiction,  mostly  hearing  domestic  and  juvenile  cases.  When  the  needs  of  the 

Department dictate, family court reporters are also assigned to circuit court terms. 

The  circuit  court  reporter  serves  primarily  the  circuit  court  which  has  general 

jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases. When the needs of the Department dictate, 

circuit court reporters are also assigned to family court terms. The court reporter is 

responsible for attending court sessions and other assigned proceedings; procuring 

all  necessary  materials  and  supplies  needed  to  produce  the  record;  recording  and 

transcribing  verbatim  testimony  of  court  hearings;  transcribing  and  delivering 

records to requesters within prescribed time limits; providing appellants and other 

parties with a timely, accurate, verbatim record of court proceedings; maintaining all 

notes, tapes and records of proceedings as stipulated by this manual; and assisting 

judges and court personnel with reasonable requests while working in and out of the 

courtroom. The court reporter must be able to work independently while exercising 

good judgment and discretion. 

E. 

Assignment of Court Reporters 

 

The  assignment  of  court  reporters  is  made  by  Court  Administration  at  the 

direction of the Chief Justice. Assignments are made by Order. Court reporters are 

expected  to  remain  in  the  court  with  the  judge  in  the  county  to  which  they  are 

assigned unless a change in assignment is directed by Court Administration.  A court 

reporter  may  not  switch  assignments  with  another  court  reporter  without  prior 

approval from Court Administration in accordance with the current procedures. 

 

6 

It is the responsibility of the court reporter to thoroughly read each monthly 

schedule  and  to  identify  his/her  court  assignments.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the 

court reporter to contact the judge or the clerk of court to determine the time and 

location of court. 

In the event the court reporter becomes available because court breaks down 

for  all  or  part  of  the  week,  the  court  reporter  is  required  to  notify  Court 

Administration via phone call to the CR Hotline (1.877.695.5771 or 803.734.1858) or 

by  email  to  CRHotline@sccourts.org  so  that  court  reporter  assignments  may  be 

adjusted to assist as needed. 

F. 

Unassigned Days/Weeks - Availability 

 

 

Court  reporters  are  scheduled  "unassigned"  days/weeks  when  they  are  not 

assigned  to  terms  of  court  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  transcripts.  When 

unassigned, a court reporter is “on call” and thus must be readily available for court 

assignment should the need arise. Court Administration must be able to speak with 

any court reporter within 30 minutes of a telephone call between the hours of 7:00 

a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 

If the need to schedule an unassigned court reporter arises and, for any reason, 

Court Administration is unable to reach the court reporter within the prescribed time 

period,  he/she  is  subject  to  disciplinary  action  and  will  be  required  to  submit  an 

annual  leave  slip.  Accordingly,  every  court  reporter  is  required  to  maintain  a 

working  voice  messaging  system,  or  cell  phone  so  that  he/she  may  immediately 

 

7 

receive or retrieve messages to ensure that calls are returned within the applicable 

time frames. 

If  a  court  reporter  is  not  available  for  any  reason,  including  illness,  when 

unassigned, Court Administration must be notified immediately and the appropriate 

leave  requested.  Disciplinary  action  may  be  taken  if,  when  contacted,  the  court 

reporter indicates he/she is unavailable for assignment and sick or annual leave has 

not been requested and approved in advance. The court reporter will be required to 

submit a leave slip at that time. 

When a court reporter is unassigned, he/she is expected to be prepared to leave 

home  promptly  after  receiving  notification  of  an  assignment  in  order  to  avoid 

unnecessary  delay  in  court  proceedings.  Court  assignments  to  replace  court 

reporters  who  are  sick  or  unavailable  for  work  are  made  beginning  at  7  a.m.  on 

workdays  once  the  Hotline  is  checked.  If  called  after  8:30  a.m.  on  a  workday,  the 

court  reporter  should  be  dressed  and  have  all  necessary  equipment  in  his/her 

possession and be prepared to report to court immediately. 

All  unassigned  court  reporters  are  subject  to  court  assignment  during  “in 

chambers” weeks unless annual or sick leave has been approved in advance. 

III. 

JOB QUALIFICATIONS: 

The  job  of  court  reporter  is  important  to  the  judicial  process  and  a  court 

reporter  must  be  able  to  accept  and  carry  out  responsibilities  in  a  pressured 

environment. 

8 

     

 

 

All applicants must meet the following eligibility qualifications: 

A. Education:  Applicants must possess a high school diploma or its equivalent. 

B. Certification: Applicants must meet a minimum of one of the following 

qualifications: 

1)  an associate degree or a certificate in court reporting 

from an accredited or approved program/institution; or 

2)  a Registered Professional Reporter (RPR) certificate or a 

Certified Verbatim Reporter (CVR) certificate. 

C. Experience:  Actual trial courtroom experience is preferred. 

The  method  of  reporting  used  in  qualifying  as  a  court  reporter  must  be  the 

method used to report all court proceedings unless the court reporter has successfully 

demonstrated to Court Administration proficiency in a different method. 

A court reporter employed by the Department is a full-time employee and is 

not  allowed  to  accept  outside  employment  as  a  court  reporter.  Transcription  of 

courtroom proceedings as addressed herein is not regarded as outside employment. 

IV. 

BENEFITS 

Court reporters employed by the Judicial Department are entitled to certain 

salary and non-salary benefits. 

A  Information About Benefits 

Specific  information  regarding  salary,  annual  leave,  sick  leave,  Family  and 

Medical  Leave  Act 

leave,  holidays,  pay  days,  payroll  deductions,  travel 

reimbursement,  insurance,  savings  bonds, deductions  for  charitable contributions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

deferred compensation plans, worker's compensation benefits, and retirement plans 

is available from the Office of Finance and Personnel. Please contact that office for 

such information. 

B  Leave 

 

 

The  same  leave  benefits  are  available  to  court  reporters  as  are  available  to 

other state employees. The Department’s Employee Leave Policy is set out in 

Appendix 2. Contact the Office of Finance and Personnel for details. Application for 

Leave forms must be submitted for any leave that is taken. (See Appendix 1, Form 

4). 

These slips must be completed to the nearest quarter hour. 

Because  of  the  factors  involved  in  scheduling  terms  of  court  and  the 

assignment of court reporters to those terms, requests for annual leave made by court 

reporters must be submitted to Court Administration for approval at least 30 days 

in  advance  of  schedule  release  date,  except  in  unusual  circumstances.  Approval  of 

leave  is  dependent  upon  many  factors;  most  importantly,  adequate  coverage  of 

scheduled court terms. Therefore, Court Administration reserves the right to offer 

alternative dates, if the leave requested cannot be approved. 

In case of illness, Court Administration must be notified as soon as possible on 

the Hotline, but no later than the first day of illness or the resulting absence. A 

Request for Leave form must be completed upon return to work  and forwarded to 

Court  Administration.  When  more  than  three  consecutive  sick  days  are  taken,  a 

physician's statement is required. 

 

10 

If there is reason to believe that sick leave is being abused (e. g., taken as soon 

as  accumulated,  a  pattern  of  Monday/Friday  requests,  absences,  etc.)  Court 

Administration may, before approving the use of sick leave, require a certificate of a 

physician or other acceptable documentation describing the infirmity and stating the 

inclusive dates. 

Court  reporters  should  schedule  all  routine  doctor  appointments  in  advance 

during  “in-chambers”  weeks.  Sick  leave  requests  for  doctor  appointments  must  be 

submitted in advance for not less than a half-day (3.75 hours). 

V. 

HARASSMENT POLICY 

 

The  Judicial  Department  is  an  equal  opportunity  employer.  It  is  the 

Department's  policy  to  comply  with  all  state  and  federal  laws  which  prohibit 

discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, pregnancy, 

age, disability, or any other protected category. In accordance with this policy, the 

Department has adopted a policy prohibiting discrimination and harassment in the 

workplace and requiring that any such harassment be immediately reported. These 

guidelines  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time.  (See  Appendix  2).  If  a  court 

reporter  feels  he  or  she  or  another  court  reporter  is  the  victim  of 

harassment,  especially  but  not  limited  to  sexual  harassment,  the  court 

reporter has an obligation to report such harassment to one of the officials 

referenced  in  the  Department’s  policy  AND to one of the following in the 

Department: the Director of Court Administration, the Deputy Director of 

 

11 

Court Administration, the Director of Finance and Personnel, or to the 

Human  Resources Manager. 

VI.  DISCIPLINARY POLICY AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 

Although Court Administration may refer to the Progressive Discipline Model 

Policy promulgated by the Budget and Control Board Office of Human Resources for 

guidance in disciplinary matters, the degree of disciplinary action imposed in 

particular situations will be determined by Court Administration and/or the 

Supreme Court, in their sole discretion.  Neither body is obliged to use any 

particular form, level or step of discipline prior to discharging court reporters. The 

appropriate level of discipline, up to and including termination and/or a contempt of 

court finding, will be determined by Court Administration and/or the Supreme Court 

in their sole discretion. 

VII.  EMPLOYEE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE 

Whenever a court reporter feels that he/she has been subjected to treatment 

which is unlawful or otherwise in violation of Judicial Department policies, the court 

reporter may utilize the procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in its Order of July 

24, 2017 (as hereafter altered or amended).  (See Appendix 2.) 

VIII.  REQUIRED BACKUP EQUIPMENT 

 

 

   

 

 

 

12 

Court reporters are required to use a digital backup recorder for capturing the 

record and must preserve the record for the five-year period referred to in Rule 607 

(i).  Court reporters may receive a one-time reimbursement of up to 

$100  from  the  Department  for  the  purchase  of  a  backup  recorder  as  an  allowable 

expense as long as funds are available.  Records should be backed up daily and stored 

monthly, and are subject to a random audit for compliance. 

X. 

RETURN OF RECORDS AND EQUIPMENT 

 

All  court  records  and  any  state-supplied  items  are  the  property  of  the 

Department.  When  a  court  reporter’s  employment  with  the  Department  ends,  all 

primary and back-up recordings, trial notes, and log sheets must be properly labeled, 

dated,  and  transmitted  in  person  to  Court  Administration  in  Columbia,  South 

Carolina, no later than the last day of employment. 

Also upon termination of employment, any court reporter to whom the Judicial 

Department  has  issued  furniture  or  equipment  which  has  been  placed  in  his/her 

residence must return all such items in person to the Judicial Department in 

Columbia, South Carolina, on or before the date of termination. 

In the event of noncompliance with this section, the Department may withhold 

from  any  outstanding  pay  checks  or  other  remuneration  due  the  value  of  such 

unreturned  records  and  equipment  until  such  time  as  the  court  reporter  complies 

with this section. 

XI. 

PRESERVING THE RECORD 

 

13 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A. 

Circuit Court 

1. 

Roll Call 

2. 

General Sessions 

Verbatim testimony of the jury venire roll call proceeding is not required. 

Every  proceeding  of  a  criminal  case  must  be  recorded  verbatim.  Case 

information should be obtained from the solicitor's office prior to commencement of 

the trial. 

3. 

Common Pleas 

All aspects or phases of proceedings in civil cases must be recorded verbatim. 

Opening statements and closing arguments are part of the record and must be taken 

verbatim, unless all parties, on the record, agree otherwise. The roster of civil cases 

should be obtained from the clerk of court's office as a matter of standard procedure. 

Roster meetings should not be recorded unless required by the presiding judge. 

B. 

Family Court 

All  court  proceedings  and  such  other  hearings  as  the  Family  Court  judge 

directs must be recorded verbatim. 

C. 

Pre-Trial/Hearing Preparation 

Always  ensure  that  an  adequate  supply  of  necessary  materials  such  as 

cassettes, CD’s, paper, pads, pencils, evidence stickers, etc., is on hand and that all 

primary  electronic  recording  devices  and  back-up  equipment  are  functioning 

Court reporters should ask attorneys to furnish the following information: 

properly. 

 

14 

1. 

A copy of all material they intend to read verbatim into the record.  A 

copy of motions and citations is also helpful. 

2. 

The case names, case numbers, and correct spelling of witness and 

attorney names involved in the action. 

A  court  reporter  should  provide  his/her  name  and  address  to  attorneys  or 

parties to facilitate transcript requests. 

D. 

Equipment Check/Malfunction 

 

The  court  reporter  is  responsible  for  obtaining  a  clear,  complete,  and 

understandable  record  of  the  court  proceedings.  Before  a  proceeding  begins,  the 

court  reporter  should  check  equipment  to  ensure  it  is  functioning  properly.  This 

check should be done both before and after people enter the courtroom and prior to 

the judge’s entry, so that all necessary adjustments can be made without disturbing 

the proceeding. The court reporter should maintain a constant check to ensure that 

the equipment functions during the course of the proceeding. 

Prior to the court’s convening, the court reporter and judge should agree on a 

signal which will indicate that equipment has malfunctioned and that no record is 

being made of the proceeding.  If a malfunction occurs, the court reporter must signal 

or verbally request the judge to stop the proceedings.  Do not be afraid to say there 

is  a  malfunction  of  equipment.  Court  proceedings  must  stop  if  malfunctions  of 

primary equipment cannot be remedied. 

Many minor malfunctions can be corrected immediately by the court reporter 

if the court reporter has a good understanding of the equipment being used and is 

 

15 

familiar with trouble-shooting guides. For example, two very common malfunctions 

are  lack  of  power  and  loose  connections.  All  power  connections  should  be  checked 

before doing anything else. Next, all cables should be checked for loose connections, 

especially microphone cables. Court reporters must use a power surge protector on 

all  electrical  equipment  and  are  strongly  advised  to  have  additional  backup 

equipment. 

XII.  DOCUMENT CONTROL 

 

 

A. 

Trial Logs 

During  the  course  of  proceedings,  the  court  reporter  should  maintain  a 

complete  trial  log.  This  is  a  brief  longhand  description  of  all  essential  events, 

providing identification of speakers and any clarifying information. 

Trial logs should contain the following essential items: case number, case title, 

tape control number, nature of the proceedings, name of the judge, name of the court 

reporter,  counsel  of  record,  names  of  witnesses,  date  and  time,  and  a  listing  of 

exhibits identified and received. This record keeping can be facilitated by the use of 

various forms (See Appendix 3). 

In all criminal jury cases, the court reporter should maintain a record of all 

proceedings during the jury selection process and obtain or create a list of the jury 

panel. The list should indicate each juror's name, race, and sex and should include 

those jurors seated as well as those stricken. (See Exhibit 2, voir dire/Batson form, 

Appendix 3). The jury panel list should be included when it is specifically requested 

as part of the transcript. 

 

16 

All audio recordings should be numbered and dated. Log sheets should show 

corresponding  audio  recording  dates.  The  court  reporter  should  log  all  key  events, 

speaker identifications, and clarification of any words or series of words which could 

be  misunderstood  by  the  transcriber.  Trial  notes  serve  as  a  detailed  chronological 

guide to the electronic record, and are helpful in the effective and rapid use of that 

record (See Exhibit 1, Appendix 3). Marking Exhibits 

Court  reporters  are  responsible  for  marking  exhibits.  The  court  reporter 

should  securely  affix  either  a  stamp  or  an  adhesive  label  to  identify  exhibits.  The 

stamp  or  label  must  contain  the  following  information:  identity  of  the  party 

introducing the exhibit, i.e., The State, plaintiff or defendant; exhibit number; court 

reporter's initials; and date of the hearing. When a stamp or label cannot be used, 

the  court  reporter  should  attach  to  the  exhibit  a  tag  which  lists  the  required 

information. 

B. 

Retention and Disposition of Exhibits 

 

All exhibits, whether marked for identification or in evidence, shall remain in 

the custody of the court reporter throughout the proceedings. 

In  proceedings  which  last  more  than  one  day,  it  is  the  court  reporter's 

responsibility to see that exhibits marked for identification or evidence are secure at 

the end of the day. Items such as weapons, drugs, cash, etc., must be secured with 

the clerk of court for safekeeping if the court reporter exits the courtroom. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  proceedings,  the  court  reporter  should  not  retain 

custody  of  any  exhibits  that  have  been  marked  for  identification  or  received  in 

 

17 

evidence.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the  court,  the  clerk  of  court  shall  retain 

possession of all exhibits admitted into evidence or marked for identification during 

a hearing or trial before the circuit or family court. (Rule 606(a), SCACR) (See 

Appendix 4).  A receipt should be obtained from the clerk of court to acknowledge 

possession of exhibits.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 3).  Do not release any exhibit to 

any person other than the clerk of court unless directed by the court on the record. 

XIII. CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF THE RECORD 

 

 

A. 

Record Maintenance 

All courtroom records including steno notes, backup materials, and logs should 

be kept in a secure and safe manner in chronological order. All court records in the 

courtroom must be kept in a secure place whenever the court reporter is not present. 

All audio recordings, steno notes, trial logs, and jury lists should be filed and 

maintained together in chronological order on a weekly basis in an expandable 

folder.  The cover and index tab of the folder should be clearly marked with the date, 

docket numbers, county and judge.  All audio recordings must be dated. 

In  addition,  voice writers  must  clearly  label  audio recordings  as  primary  or 

backup and number each in chronological order. 

In the case of computer assisted transcription, (CAT), all steno notes, along 

with all audio recordings, must be retained. 

The following items should be left for court reporters assigned to replace you 

1.  Case information sheet, witness list, docket sheet; 

in court: 

 

18 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Exhibit list reflecting those marked for i.d. and entered in evidence; 

3.  Digital files with instructions for use; 

4.  Court reporter trial log and other helpful information; 

5.  Court reporter contact information in case there are questions. 

B. 

Requests to Listen to Audio Recordings/Read Steno Notes 

Court reporters  shall not grant any request to listen to audio recordings or to 

read  steno  notes  unless  the  requestor  has  received  written  authorization  from  the 

presiding judge or, in his/her absence, the chief judge for administrative purposes in 

that  circuit. 

C. 

Retention of Primary and Back-up Tapes 

Rule 607(i), SCACR governs the retention of tapes. It provides that a court 

reporter shall retain the primary and back-up tapes of a proceeding that has not 

been transcribed for a period of at least five years after the date of the proceeding. 

Only after the expiration of that period may the court reporter reuse or destroy the 

tapes. If the proceeding was a hearing or trial which lasted for more than one day, 

the time shall be computed from the last day of the hearing or trial. 

In any proceeding which has been transcribed, the court reporter shall retain 

the primary and back-up tapes which have been transcribed for a period of at least one 

year after the original transcript is sent to the requesting party to allow any party to 

challenge the accuracy of the transcription. When there is a challenge to the accuracy 

of a transcript, the court reporter will respond to the challenger in writing.  The court 

 

19 

reporter will then review the record and report the findings in writing to the 

challenger, with a copy to all parties and Court Administration. Any inaccuracies will 

be corrected and the pages forwarded to the challenger at no cost. Copies of 

correspondence relating to a challenge to a transcript's accuracy must be provided to 

Court Administration in accordance with Rules 207 and 607, SCACR.  Further review 

of the record may be permitted by the presiding judge upon written request with good 

cause shown. If no challenge is received by the court reporter within the one-year 

period the tapes may be reused or destroyed.  (Rule 607(i), SCACR) (See Appendix 4). 

If a transcript is requested by an individual who is not a party to the case, primary 

and back-up tapes should not be destroyed or reused after the transcript is prepared until 

the  required  time  periods  are  satisfied.  This  requirement  is  necessary  because  the 

transcript produced for a non-party may not otherwise be available if an appeal is taken. 

In a death penalty case where the defendant is sentenced to death, a transcript 

is  generally requested.  Court  reporters  must  notify Court  Administration as soon  as a 

death penalty transcript is requested. 

XIV. 

TRANSCRIPTS 

A. 

Requests for Production of Transcripts 

All transcript requests must be submitted in writing or via email to the court 

reporter and state with specificity the portion of the transcript desired and whether 

a particular format (.rtf, pdf., txt.) is requested in addition to the hard copy original 

transcript. The written request must include the case caption, case number, date(s) 

of  proceeding,  county  and  judge. A  court  reporter  should  provide  attorneys  and 

 

 

 

 

20 

parties  with  his/her  name  and  address  to  expedite  transcript  requests.  Court 

reporters are required to acknowledge transcript requests, indicate whether or not 

they are able to provide the additional format requested, and provide an estimate of 

the  cost  to  produce  the  transcript  within  five  business  days  after  receipt  of  the 

request. If a request is received in error, court reporters should advise the requester 

in  writing.  A  copy  of  all  correspondence  related  to  transcript  requests  must  be 

provided to Court Administration via electronic means as specified in Rules 207 and 

607, SCACR. If a court reporter does not wish to disclose his/her home address, the 

court  reporter  must  maintain  a  post  office  box  address  and  must  provide  that 

information to Court Administration. 

Transcript requests by Circuit or Family court judges for use in their judicial 

capacity may be provided at no cost to the judge in rough draft form by ASCII disk, 

email,  by  providing  a  copy  of  audio  recording  for  the  judge  to  listen  to  at  his/her 

convenience, or by other arrangement between the court reporter and the judge. 

All  transcripts  must  be  prepared  in  the  order  in  which  the  requests  for 

transcripts  are  received,  provided,  however,  that  requests  to  transcribe  post- 

conviction relief proceedings challenging a sentence of death must be given priority 

pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 17-27-160(E) (See Appendix 4). Requests to transcribe 

proceedings challenging decisions concerning a minor’s right to obtain an abortion 

must be given priority pursuant to S.C. Code Ann § 44-41-34 (See Appendix 4). 

The production of the transcript, and one copy, of any proceeding before Judicial 

Department Boards and Commissions also takes priority. To make efficient use of 

 

21 

short periods of available work time, a court reporter may produce transcripts that 

do not exceed a total of fifty pages each, such as short proceedings involving motions, 

guilty pleas, post-conviction relief, and Rules to Show Cause, provided that deadlines 

for previously ordered transcripts can be met. 

The court reporter shall transcribe and deliver all transcripts no later than 60 

days after the date of the request unless an extension has been approved by Court 

Administration. (See § XIV (D), and Rules 207 and 607, SCACR) (See Appendix 4). 

The due date will be determined by the date the court reporter receives the request. 

It  is  therefore  recommended  that  the  requestor’s  original  email  or  the  envelope 

showing  the  postmark  be  retained.  In  the  case  of  court  reporters  who  require 

advance payment, the due date will be 60 days after payment is received by the court 

reporter. 

Attorneys may order any portion of a transcript which they desire but the court 

reporter will not be required to transcribe with greater specificity than the following 

examples: voir dire by juror; jury selection; plaintiff's or defendant's opening 

statements or closing arguments; the entire direct, cross, redirect or  records 

examination of a particular witness by a particular attorney or the ruling of the court. 

Court reporters may prepare transcripts for individuals who are not parties to 

a case or attorneys involved in a case if the court reporter secures the approval of the 

trial judge. This approval is necessary because certain court proceedings are 

confidential. 

 

22 

Whenever it appears to Court Administration, based on the number of pending 

pages, or extension requests or any other reason, that a court reporter cannot prepare 

a transcript within a reasonable period of time, Court Administration may require 

the court reporter to turn over primary and back-up tapes to another court reporter 

for production of the transcript. 

Court  reporters  who  voluntarily  seek  transcript  production  assistance  may 

contact  Court  Administration  for  names  of  court  reporters  who  are  interested  in 

assisting them. Court reporters are required to advise Court Administration of the 

name  of  the  court  reporter  who  is  assisting  them  in  order  for  the  transcript  to  be 

transferred  appropriately  to  that  court  reporter  in  the  Court  Reporter  Transcript 

Tracking System. 

B. 

Payment 

 

 

In  addition  to  salary,  court  reporters  are  entitled  to  charge  fees  set  for 

producing transcription of a proceeding upon request.  The current fees are set forth 

in Rule 607(h), SCACR, as amended by Order of August 14, 2006. (See Appendix 4). 

A court reporter may not charge the higher rates for expedited (overnight or daily) 

delivery  of  transcripts  unless  the  requesting  party  or  parties  have  asked  for 

expedited treatment. 

No  fees  may  be  charged  for  transcripts  of  proceedings  before  Judicial 

Department  Boards  and  Commissions;  however,  transcripts  of  hearings  shall  be 

 

23 

made available to the respondent at respondent’s expense. (See Rule 26(c) (5), Rule 

413, SCACR and Rule 26(c) (5), Rule 502, SCACR).  (ADD LINK) 

Compensation for transcripts requested shall be paid by the requestor at the 

existing rate according to such payment/delivery arrangements as the court reporter 

and the requesting party find mutually agreeable. Generally, court reporters collect 

transcription  fees  from  the  requestor  upon  delivery  of  the  transcript.  Before  any 

transcribing is begun, court reporters may require advance payment. The date such 

advance  payment  is  received  will  be  considered  the  transcript  request  date.  (See 

Prepayment Request letter, Appendix 3, Exhibit 4). 

Attorneys will be billed for entire portions requested and supplied but may not 

be compelled to pay for portions which are supplied in error.  It is the court reporter's 

responsibility to clarify ambiguous transcription requests in writing in advance. 

When more than one party requests a transcript or a portion of a transcript 

the date of the request will determine which party pays for the preparation of the 

original  transcript.  The  first  party  requesting  a  transcript  will  pay  for  an  original 

and  the  second  will  pay  for  a  copy.  If  the  first  request  is  for  a  portion,  then  the 

original  price  is  charged  for  that  portion.  A  subsequent  request  for  additional 

portions will be an original request for that material and will be charged the price 

for originals.  A subsequent request for the same portion plus additional portions will 

be charged at the copy price for the duplicated portion and the original price for the 

additional portions. 

 

24 

When two or more requests for the same transcript are received on the same 

day, the request for the most pages will be treated as the original request and the 

other request as the copy. When the State and a private litigant make a request on 

the same day, the private litigant will pay the original price and the State will pay 

for a copy. If the State is requesting portions not requested by the other party, then 

the State will pay the original price for those additional portions and the copy price 

for the remainder. 

When privately retained attorneys handle the appeal in a death penalty case, 

the State pays for the original transcript and the attorneys shall be charged at the 

copy rate for any transcript or portion thereof ordered to perfect the appeal. 

In the event that the court appoints an attorney to represent an indigent party 

and  no  source  for  payment  of  a  transcript  exists,  the  attorney  should  submit  the 

matter of payment to the court having jurisdiction. The judge may then order one of 

the parties to the proceeding to bear all or part of the expense for the production of 

the record. 

C. 

Collection of Overdue Payments 

 

An  invoice  should  accompany  the  transcript  when  it  is  delivered  to  the 

requesting party. The invoice should state that payment for transcripts is due upon 

receipt of the transcript. If such notice has been given, and a court reporter has not 

received payment within thirty (30) days after delivery to the party or the attorney 

requesting same, the court reporter should send another invoice, marked “overdue,” 

to the party or attorney who requested the transcript.  If  payment is not received 

 

25 

within  forty-five  (45)  days  from  the  original  due  date,  a  third  invoice,  marked 

“overdue-third request,” should be sent. If payment still has not been received after 

sixty (60) days from the original due date, a fourth invoice and notice should be sent 

and  copies  of  all  invoices  and  correspondence  should  be  forwarded  to  Court 

Administration for further action via email to transcripts@sccourts.org. The fourth 

notice should indicate that a copy has been sent to Court Administration. 

D. 

Extension Requests 

 

A court reporter has 60 days in which to prepare a transcript.  After this initial 

60-day period, extension requests must be made in 30-day increments. Extensions 

should be requested only during the 10-day period preceding the applicable deadline. 

After May 14, 2018, all requests are to be made by transmitting a completed a Notice 

of  Request  for  Extension  form  to  Court  Administration  via  electronic  means  as 

specified in the current Supreme Court Order. (See Appendix 1, Form 2; Rules 207 

and 607, SCACR; Order ###, In Re: Electronic Means.)  This form must be completed 

in  its  entirety.  Court  Administration  may  grant  a  maximum  of  three  30-day 

extensions. Additional requests for extension will not be allowed except by order of 

the Chief Justice.  

Unless otherwise controlled by order, which has been promptly forwarded to 

Court Administration, a court reporter may not agree to expedite a transcript if the 

court reporter has pending any transcripts for which an extension has been 

requested. 

 

26 

 

 

 

 

XV.  PRODUCTION OF THE TRANSCRIPT 

In the appeal process, the transcript is the official document which provides 

the  appellate  court  reliable  information  regarding  trial  court  proceedings.  All 

transcripts must reflect a professional work product to ensure uniformity and adhere 

to the standardized format which is described below. Examples of transcripts which 

use  the  required  format  are  included  for  clarification.  Court  rules  are  referenced 

where pertinent. 

A.  Preparation Responsibility 

The court reporter is responsible for the preparation of the transcript. This is 

a significant responsibility.  The requested transcript must be verbatim and prepared 

in upper and lower case and in accordance with the standardized format described 

below.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 5-15). 

B.  Materials and Organization Required 

1. 

Paper 

Transcripts of record shall be printed on 8½ by 11-inch opaque and unglazed 

paper. The paper must be at least 20-pound weight. Do not use onionskin paper or 

anti-copy paper. If so desired, the court reporter may have his/her name printed on 

the bottom of the page. 

2. 

Printer Ink or Cartridges 

 

27 

The use of high quality black ink or cartridges is required on all transcribed 

documents. Under no circumstances should any ink or cartridge which smudges or 

flakes be used to prepare a transcript of record. 

3. 

Binding a Volume 

To  bind  a  volume,  use  evenly  spaced,  3-hole  punched  paper,  and  secure  the 

document in a binder using a clear acetate front cover, unless otherwise specified. 

The use of the binder with a clear acetate front cover allows the title page to be seen 

immediately. 

If  the  total  number  of  pages  is  more  than  enough  for  one  volume,  the  court 

reporter  should  divide  the  material  into  equal-sized  volumes,  with  a  title  page  on 

each volume and each volume being numbered. 

C. 

Format Requirements 

1. 

Print Size 

Print size shall be 10 cpi, 6 lines per vertical inch, or a font size of 12.  Lines 

of text in the document are to be double-spaced unless otherwise authorized in this 

manual. 

2. 

Margins 

The margins for transcripts shall be one and three quarters (1 3/4) inches on 

the left of the page and one-half (½) inch on the right of the page. 

3. 

Lines per Page 

The transcript of record must have twenty-five (25) lines per full printed page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

 

 

 

 

 

of text. 

4. 

Numbering of Pages 

The  title  page  is  considered  page  1,  but  must  not  be  numbered.  Numbering 

will  begin  on  the  first  page  of  the  index  as  page  2,  and  continue  consecutively 

thereafter,  with  numbers  placed  in  the  upper  right-hand  corner  or  at  the  bottom 

middle  of  the  page.  Consecutive  numbering  must  be  used  throughout  all  volumes, 

regardless of the number of volumes involved. 

D.  Body of the Transcript of Record 

1. 

Title Page 

The title page shall be typed in upper and lower case and include state, county, 

full  case  title,  case  number,  applicable  court,  date,  and  location  of  proceeding,  full 

name  of  the  presiding  judge,  full  names  of  appearances,  and  the  court  reporter's 

name. (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 5). 

2. 

Index 

The index to the transcript is included after the title page. (See Appendix 3, 

Exhibits 6 and 7).  This must be a chronological index and should be compiled by the 

court reporter as the body of the transcript is being transcribed. Upon completion of 

the body, the index must be prepared.  The index must cross reference the witnesses, 

exhibits, opening statements, closing arguments, charge of the court, jury’s verdict, 

court sentence, and certificate of the court reporter. In those transcripts containing 

 

29 

more than one volume, a master index is to be compiled and placed in volume one of 

the transcript. 

3.  Listing of Exhibits 

 

 

The index page must also contain an exhibit index which lists all exhibits that 

were  entered  into  the  proceedings.  In  this  listing,  each  exhibit  will  be  cross 

referenced  to  the  page  number(s)  where  the  exhibit  was  first  marked  for 

identification and/or received into evidence. (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 8 and 9). In 

the case of audio or video tape exhibits played in open court, a court reporter should 

clearly indicate whether or not the audio or video tape was transcribed in the listing 

on the index page. If no exhibits are introduced during the proceeding, this must be 

noted on the index page.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 10). 

Preparation  of  the  exhibit  list  will  be  expedited  by  maintaining  a  running 

compilation of the exhibits as they are encountered. 

4.  Spacing 

Label  all  examination  questions  as  (Q),  and  answers  as  (A)  and  print  flush 

with the left-hand margin. Using this format, only one tab stop at 5 spaces from the 

margin is required. This tab at 5 is the beginning point for all indented text except 

for  identification  of  witnesses,  which  is  in  the  center  of  the  line.  (See  Appendix  3, 

Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

5.  Break in Thought 

 

30 

Sometimes  a  participant  will  have  a  change  in  thought  in  the  middle  of  a 

sentence  and  continue  his/her  statement  with  a  new  sentence;  this  should  be 

indicated by 2 hyphens (--).  (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

If a participant is interrupted, this should be indicated by 3 hyphens (---). See 

Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

Should the participant complete the sentence after being interrupted, then the 

beginning of the sentence should start with 3 hyphens (---).  (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 

11.1 - 11.5). 

6.  Colloquy 

If  a  participant  does  not  complete  a  sentence  but  was  not  interrupted,  this 

should be indicated by three periods (. . .).  (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

Colloquy is defined as an on-the-record dialogue between the court and another 

individual.  To  transcribe  a  colloquy,  the  line  begins  at  the  tab  stop;  print  the 

speaker's  name  in  all  caps  followed  by  a  colon,  and  followed  by  two  spaces.  Then 

print the dialogue and continue to the right-hand margin; succeeding lines return to 

the  left-hand  margin  and  continue  until  the  next  speaker  is  introduced.  (See 

Appendix 3, Exhibit 12). 

7.  Parenthetical 

The parenthetical is a remark added to the transcript by the court reporter to 

ensure a clear understanding of the record (e.g., the fact that an event transpired, 

times  relating  to  jury  actions,  a  witness  responds  by  physical  gesture  rather  than 

verbally). All parenthetical remarks by the court reporter must be enclosed within 

 

 

 

31 

 

 

 

parentheses. (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). However, parentheticals should 

only be added when necessary. 

E. 

Bench Conferences 

A  judge  may  wish  to  hold  a  bench  conference  in  the  presence  of  the  jury  to 

avoid having the jury enter and leave the courtroom numerous times. If the bench 

conference  is  on  the  record,  it  is  to  be  included  in  the  transcript.  However,  if  the 

bench conference is held off the record, this should be noted. A parenthetical should 

be used by the court reporter in preparing the transcript to indicate the nature of 

such a conference. 

F.  Witnesses 

During transcription, to indicate when a witness is called, indent to the center 

of the page, print the name in all caps, followed by a statement similar to "being first 

duly sworn, testifies as follows:"  (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

G.  Types of Examination 

There are four (4) major types of examination which may be conducted during 

the course of a trial: (1) direct examination -- conducted by the attorney who called 

the  witness;  (2)  cross  examination  --  witness  questioned  by  opposing  counsel;  (3) 

redirect  examination  --  first  attorney  questions  witness  again;  and  (4)  re-cross 

examination -- opposing counsel questions witness again. 

It is necessary to note a change from one kind of examination to another. 

Beginning  at  the  left-hand  margin,  transcribe  in  all  caps  the  type  of  examination 

 

32 

about  to  be  commenced,  along  with  the  identity  of  the  speaker  conducting  the 

examination; double space, moving to the left-hand margin, and begin transcribing 

in Q and A form.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

H.  Headers 

Every transcript shall include a "header" at the top of each page of testimony 

that clearly and concisely describes the contents of that page.  Headers should appear 

in the top left column at least three to four lines before the numbered text begins, 

and with the type of examination conducted.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibits 11.1 - 11.5). 

I.  Presentation of Exhibits 

The presentation of exhibits for identification and admittance is noted in the 

body  of  the  transcript.  The  exhibit  should  be  marked  when  directed  by  the  court. 

Some  exhibits  may  be  marked  for  identification  only  and  may  be  entered  later 

officially as an exhibit.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 11.2). 

J.  Motions and Objections During Trial 

When  requested,  a  motion  or  an  objection  must  be  included  as  part  of  the 

transcript.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 12).  If the motion is argued outside the presence 

of  the  jury,  this  should  be  noted.  The  format  for  including  these  objections  will 

conform to the standards specified earlier for colloquy. 

K.  Special Requests to Charge 

When a special request to charge is presented to the court, the court reporter 

should enter the fact of the request in the record as a parenthetical. 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

Each special request is given to the court in writing.  The judge will mark each 

special request as charged or not charged and then give the written request to the 

court reporter.  The requests that are accepted and charged should be printed as part 

of  the  charge  and  not  included  as  an  exhibit.  The  requests  not  charged  should  be 

numbered  with  a  consecutive  exhibit  number  and  must  be  included  as  an  exhibit 

attachment to the transcript. 

L.  Judge's Charge to the Jury 

The charge is often cited by counsel as grounds for a motion for a new trial. 

The charge must be included in the transcript of record. It is transcribed in 

narrative form, with each paragraph indented to the tab and all continuation lines 

starting flush with the left-hand margin.  (Appendix 3, Exhibit 13). 

M. Time Indications for Jury Actions 

The court reporter is required to enter the following in parenthetical form: the 

times the jury enters and exits the courtroom for any reason, begins deliberations, 

and returns the verdict.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 12). 

The jury’s verdict must be transcribed according to the standards for colloquy. 

N.  Verdict of the Jury 

(See Appendix 3, Exhibit 12). 

O.  Sentence of the Court 

The sentence is a part of the record and must be transcribed according to the 

standards for colloquy.  (See Appendix 3, Exhibit 14). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

P.  Certificate of Court Reporter 

A statement must be made by the court reporter certifying the accuracy of the 

transcript.  The  certificate  must  be  signed  by  the  reporter;  it  does  not  need  to  be 

notarized. The completion date of the transcript must be included in the certificate. 

(See Appendix 3, Exhibit 15). 

XV.  REQUIRED REPORTS 

 

 

The court reporter shall furnish information requested in the Court Reporter 

Transcript  Tracking  System  supplied  online  by  Court  Administration.  Accurately 

recording  time  worked  is  the  responsibility  of  every  court  reporter.  Altering, 

falsifying,  tampering  with  time  records,  or  recording  or  tampering  with  another 

employee’s  time  record,  may  result  in  disciplinary  action,  up  to  and  including 

termination  of  employment  or  a  finding  of  contempt.  It  is  the  court  reporter’s 

responsibility to sign time and work records. 

A court reporter’s signature on any required report constitutes a certificate 

by  him/her  that  the  information  entered  online  into  the  Court  Reporter 

Transcript  Tracking  System  on  all  reports,  including  all  time  and  work 

recorded  therein,  is  true  and  accurate  to  the  best  of  the  court  reporter’s 

knowledge. 

A. “Hours Worked” Recorded on Weekly Time Sheets (Monthly Report) 

 

35 

Time sheets detailing all “hours worked” (as that term is defined below) and 

leave  taken  shall  be  recorded  daily  on  the  Weekly  Time  Sheet  or  other  forms  as 

directed by Court Administration. 

 

 

1.  Hours Worked in Assigned vs. Unassigned Weeks/Days 

a. Assigned Weeks/Days 

During assigned weeks/days, “hours worked” are those actually spent on the 

job  performing  assigned  duties.  The  “hours  worked”  to  be  reported  in  a  day  begin 

upon the court reporter’s arrival at the assigned courthouse and end when Court has 

adjourned or recessed or the judge has otherwise indicated that the court reporter 

may depart. “Hours worked” do not include early arrival or any meal period of more 

than one-half hour, nor do they include any leave taken, time spent away from the 

courthouse  (except  at  meal  periods  of  less  than  ½  hour),  or  time  spent  at  the 

courthouse  after  Court  has  adjourned  or  recessed  or  the  judge  has  otherwise 

indicated that the court reporter may depart. 

A court reporter is encouraged to prepare transcripts at the courthouse when 

his/her services are not required in the courtroom but he/she has not been released 

from  services  for  the  day.  Therefore,  during  assigned  weeks/days,  when  a  court 

reporter’s presence is not required in the courtroom, he/she may prepare transcripts 

at  the  courthouse  during  normal  working  hours.  Although  such  work  may  also  be 

compensated under the fee-per-page provisions of Rule 607(h), SCACR (see section 

XIV(B)  herein),  it  will  also  constitute  “hours  worked”  for  purposes  of  time  to  be 

reported on weekly reports. 

 

36 

 

 

 

Such  time  may  not  be  reported  as  hours  worked,  however,  when  court  has 

adjourned  or  recessed  for  the  day  unless  the  judge  to  whom  the  court  reporter  is 

assigned requires that the court reporter remain at the courthouse. 

b. Unassigned Weeks/Days 

“Hours worked” also include those hours during unassigned weeks/days, when 

a court reporter, otherwise ready and available for work, is preparing transcripts at 

home or elsewhere. During such working hours in unassigned weeks/days, a court 

reporter is “on call” (See section II (F) herein).  If not called to work elsewhere, a court 

reporter is expected to engage in transcription services or the preparation of required 

reports to Court Administration for 7.5 hours per day.  A court reporter may not earn 

overtime compensation during unassigned weeks/days. 

2. 

Time Not Reported as Hours Worked on Weekly Time Sheets 

a.  Leave Taken 

Leave  taken  is  not  “hours  worked.”  Annual  leave,  sick  leave  or  other  leave 

taken  is  to  be  reported  as  such  on  the  weekly  time  sheet.  This  time  may  not  be 

reported as hours worked on the weekly time sheet. 

a.  Preparing Transcripts Away from the Courthouse or After Court 
Has Recessed or Adjourned When the Judge Has Not Indicated 
that the Court Reporter Must Remain 

Time  spent  preparing  transcripts  away  from  the  courthouse  or  at  the 

courthouse  after  court  has  adjourned  (unless  the  judge  has  indicated  the  court 

reporter must remain) is not to be reported as “hours worked.” Because time spent 

preparing transcripts away from the courthouse (or, for resident court reporters, at 

 

37 

 

 

the  courthouse  during  times  his/her  services  are  not  otherwise  required) 

is 

compensated on a per page basis, this time is not reported on the weekly time sheet. 

B.  Monthly Report and Time Spent Preparing Transcripts 

The Monthly Report is an essential document which provides information on court 

reporter  workload  and  production  of  transcripts.  This  portion  should  be  updated  as 

transcripts  are  delivered.  The  portion  containing  the  weekly  time  sheet  must  be 

completed on a daily basis to ensure the accuracy of reported information. This report 

must  be  completed  fully  and  information  entered  online  into  the  Court  Reporter 

Transcript Tracking System no later than the tenth of each month. This information is 

monitored closely by Court Administration. (See Appendix 1, Forms 3 & 3a). Failure to 

do so subjects the court reporter to disciplinary action. 

C. 

Quarterly Report 

Rule 508, SCACR requires that court reporters submit to Court 

Administration the gross income from fees collected during the preceding quarter 

on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 each year. (See Appendix 1, Form 4). 

This report must be entered into the Court Reporter Transcript Tracking System 

no later than the tenth of the month following the close of the quarter.  Failure 

to do so subjects the court reporter to disciplinary action. 

D. 

Compensatory Time / Overtime Pay 

For  hours  over  forty  worked  in  any  workweek  (Monday  through  Sunday),  a 

court reporter will receive, in lieu of overtime compensation, compensatory time off 

 

38 

at the rate of one and one-half hours for each hour over 40 worked in any workweek. 

This time may be used within a reasonable period (reasonable is defined as within 

one year of earning compensatory time) after making a written request if the use of 

the compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the Department or 

the  court.  A  court  reporter  may  accrue  only  240  hours  of  compensatory  time  off. 

Court  Administration  may  schedule  compensatory  weeks/days  which  will  offset 

accrued compensatory time at the rate of 7.5 hours per day or 37.5 hours per week. 

Court reporters are required to submit the timesheet reflecting the days where this 

compensatory time was earned, a memo outlining the days you are requesting and 

reflecting the balance remaining, along with the original leave slip for approval to 

Court  Administration.  This  will  ensure  that  compensatory  time  off  is  credited 

correctly  and  used  within  the  required  reasonable  period.  Any  hours  over  forty 

worked in any workweek during which a court reporter maintains a balance of 240 

or more hours of unused compensatory time will be paid at the rate of one and one 

half the court reporter’s regular rate (weekly pay divided by forty). 

Example: Court reporter Mary Smith’s annual salary is $26,000.00. On Monday, 

May 1, Ms. Smith has accrued a balance of 240 hours of unused compensatory time. 

Ms.  Smith  works  45  hours  that  week.  During  the  weeks  of  May  8  and  May  15, 

however,  Court  Administration  assigns  Ms.  Smith  to  two  compensatory  weeks  in 

which she is not required to work.  The week of May 22, she returns to work and 

 

 

39 

works  50  hours.  The  week  of  May  29,  she  works  37.5  hours.  How  much  overtime 

pay does she receive for the month of May and at what rate is it paid? 

 

 

Answer:  In  addition  to  her  regular  salary,  Ms.  Smith  receives  pay  for  5  hours  of 

overtime at 1.5 times her regular hourly rate, an extra $93.75. 

In the first week, she worked 5 hours overtime during a period in which she 

maintained a 240-hour balance of unused compensatory time.  During the following 

two compensatory weeks to which the Department assigned her, this  balance was 

reduced by compensatory time taken, at the rate of 37.5 hours per week, for a total 

debit of 75 hours.  At that time, her balance of unused compensatory time came to 

165 hours.  Because during the week of May 22, her balance of unused compensatory 

time was less than 240 hours, the 10 hours overtime she worked that week would not 

be paid at the overtime rate, but rather would be added to the balance of her unused 

compensatory time at the rate of 1.5 hours per hour overtime worked, or an 

additional 15 hours, bringing her balance of unused compensatory time to 180 hours. 

For the week of May 1 only, Ms. Smith would be paid for 5 hours overtime work 

at an overtime rate of $18.75 per hour. The overtime rate is 1.5 times her regular 

rate of $12.50 per hour; her regular rate is determined by dividing her weekly pay, 

$500.00 per week, by 40 hours. 

Any questions about overtime pay or compensatory time accrual or use should 

be directed to the Department’s Office of Finance and Personnel. 

XVII. TRAVEL EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT 

 

40 

While traveling on assigned duties, court reporters will be allowed 

reimbursement for mileage and actual subsistence expenses subject to the Travel 

Reimbursement Guidelines issued by the Judicial Department as amended 

periodically. (See Appendix 2, Form 6).  Travel support documents must be 

completed to obtain reimbursement for allowable travel expenses. The original of the 

travel support document and accompanying travel verification forms should be 

mailed to Court Administration for processing.  (See Appendix 1, Form 5).
