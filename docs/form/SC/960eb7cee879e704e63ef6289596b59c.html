The Supreme Court of South Carolina 
 

 

 

 

 

MANDATORY SUMMARY COURT JUDGE  
MENTORING PROGRAM 
 
UNIFORM MENTORING PLAN 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 

 

 
Pursuant  to  Rule  512  of  the  South  Carolina  Appellate  Court  Rules 
establishing the Mandatory Summary Court Judge Mentoring Program, the 
Supreme Court has set out three objectives for the mentoring plan. These 
objectives are intended to be a guide to the development of the relationship 
between  the  mentor  and  the  new  summary  court  judge  and  should  be 
addressed on an on-going basis over the course of the mentorship period.  

he relationship between the mentor and new summary court judge is not a 
check-list of items to be covered and then ended.  It is intended to be the 
beginning  of  a  long-term  professional  relationship  that  enhances  the  new 
summary court judge's ability to perform his or her duties in a responsible 
and  professional  manner.    The  goal  of  the  program  is  to  provide  new 
summary  court  judges  with  the  tools  that  will  enable  them  to  continually 
improve  and  enhance  their  ability  to  perform  their  judicial  functions  with 
appropriate  levels  of  professionalism,  in  an  ethical  and  fair  manner,   
maintaining the dignity and respect which should accompany the office they 
hold.

OBJECTIVES 

he three elements set out by the Supreme Court are as follows: 

Before the hearing: prepare yourself for your role in the judicial process. 

In the courtroom: conduct yourself at a high ethical standard. 

Engage  in  ongoing  learning  and  development  in  the  area  of  ethics  and 
professionalism. 

ach  objective  is  to  be  met  through  a  series  of  action  steps  over  the  course  of  the 
mentorship year. Suggested action steps are included in this model plan; however, the 
mentor  and  new  judge  should  work  out  a  plan  that  best  suits  their  schedules  and 
workloads. The mentor and new judge must schedule an Initial Meeting within thirty days 
of being notified of the assignment of a mentor. The mentor and new judge must complete 
an  Individualized  Mentoring  Plan,  which  must  be  submitted  to  South  Carolina  Court 
Administration (Court Administration) for review within thirty days of the Initial Meeting.  
 

PLEASE NOTE 
 

All three elements must be included in your Individualized Mentoring Plan. 

In  order  to  complete  the  Mandatory  Summary  Court  Judge  Mentoring 
Program, all three elements in your Individualized Mentoring Plan must be 
met. 

SUGGESTED ACTION STEPS 

t is important that you establish a clear understanding as to the expectations of 
both the mentor and the new summary court judge. 

stablishing clear expectations is critical to the success of the mentoring relationship. The 
mentor and the new judge should meet in person as soon as possible and develop a plan 
to address completing all the objectives of the program.  The goal is a clear plan of action 
for the course of the next year. 

hings to consider include: 

. 

Schedule the Initial Meeting, which may be at the office of the mentor or the new 
judge, or casually for lunch;

Determine the frequency of "formal" contact, the best methods of communication, 
to include in-person meetings, telephone conversations, e-mails, or a combination 
of the three. 

bjective A 

Before the hearing: prepare yourself for your role in the judicial process. 

he  new  judge  should  be  aware  of  how  his  or  her  preparedness  and  professionalism 
affects the behavior and attitudes of lawyers, officers, and pro se litigants who appear in 
his or her court. 

hings to consider as you set out the steps for meeting this objective include: 

Periodic  discussions  on  the  following:  the  importance  of  wearing  a  robe  when 
conducting court and recording all proceedings; 

Discuss with the new judge the importance of maintaining control of the courtroom 
as well as methods for doing so; and 

Ensure that the new judge gains an understanding of the importance of staying 
current with recent legislative and case law changes, as well as how to locate this 
information  through  the  websites  of  the  Judicial  Department  and  the  South 
Carolina Legislature. 

bjective B 

In the courtroom: conduct yourself at a high ethical standard. 

he  importance  of  developing  professional  standards  and  exercising  civility  in  the 
courtroom cannot be overstated.  Helping the new judge to understand the expectations 
placed on the judge by the Judicial Canons is critical to meeting this objective. Discuss 
the challenges that the new judge may encounter in upholding the requirements of the 
Canons.  The mentor should observe the new judge in his or her courtroom initially and 
then  again  after  at  least  three  months.    Additionally,  the  new  judge  shall  observe  the 
mentor  holding  court  on  at  least  one  occasion.  The  mentor  should  stress  the  need  to 
review the Advisory Opinions and Ethics Updates, which will provide guidance concerning 
the interpretation and practical application of the Judicial Canons.  

hings to consider as you set out the steps for meeting this objective include: 

Periodic discussions on the following: the role of the judge in the legal system; the 
judge's  responsibility  in  adhering  to  the  Judicial  Canons;  and  the  practical 
challenges in meeting those responsibilities; 

Review the concept of judicial restraint; and 

Ensure that the new judge gains an understanding of the local legal community's 
expectations of professionalism and behavior, including the importance of being 
on time for court and working all hours assigned.

bjective C 

Engage  in  ongoing  learning  and  development  in  the  area  of  ethics  and 
professionalism. 

ommon  complaints  against  judges  include  allegations  of  bias,  mishandling  of  court 
funds,  and  poor  supervision  of  staff.    The  mentor  should  stress  the  importance  of 
compliance with the Chief Justice's Financial Accounting Order, avoiding inappropriate 
ex  parte  communications,  and  supervising  court  staff  to  ensure  compliance  with  the 
Judicial Canons. 

hings to consider as you set out the steps for meeting this objective include: 

Review the Financial Accounting Order and disciplinary opinions in which judges 
have mishandled court funds; 

Review the provisions of the Judicial Canons that apply to court staff; and  

Discuss the prohibition against ex parte communications as well as methods for 
avoiding inappropriate communications, including the appearance of impropriety.  

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 
 
The  suggested  action  steps  are  offered  as  a  guideline  for  the  development  of  your 
Individualized  Mentoring  Plan.    Each  mentor  and  new  judge  should  work  out 
arrangements  that  best  suit  their  specific  professional  relationship  and  work  schedule. 
Given  the  relationship,  other  action  steps  may  be  more  suitable  than  those  suggested 
above.  

he mentor and new judge must complete the Individualized Mentoring Plan and submit 
a  copy  to  Court  Administration  for  review  within  thirty  days  of  the  Initial  Meeting. 
Periodically throughout the year, the plan should be reviewed and updated to ensure that 
it is still meeting the objectives of the program and the individual goals as set out by the 
mentor and new judge.  Upon completion of the mentoring experience, a Certificate of 
Completion,  signed  by  the  mentor  and  new  judge,  must  be  submitted  to  Court 
Administration.  
 

CONCLUSION 

he  mentor's  relationship  with  the  new  judge  has  the  potential  to  be  one  of  the  most 
influential  relationships  of  the  new  judge's  professional  career.    It  is  the  goal  of  the 
program and the hope of the Supreme Court that the development of strong professional 
relationships will ensure the successful transition of the new summary court judge as he 
or  she  becomes  a  valuable  member  of  the  profession.  The  Court  also  hopes  the 
relationships  created  through  this  program  will  help  new  judges  achieve  personal  and 
professional  success,  support  the  continued  civility  of  the  profession,  and  ensure  that 
judges hold themselves to, and comply with, the highest standards of the profession.
