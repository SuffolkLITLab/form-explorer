COVERSHEET FOR DMH AND DDSN EVALUATION ORDERS 
 

The Competency to Stand Trial Evaluation orders (SCCA 221 and SCCA 487) and the 
Criminal Responsibility (McNaughten) Evaluation order (SCCA 222) should not be 
altered.  It is important for purposes of compliance with the statutes as well as timeliness, 
efficiency and quality control in conducting evaluations that the applicable form order be 
used exactly as published, without alterations or additions to the terms of the form 
order.   

Additional records must be attached to the order for a complete evaluation.  It is the duty 
of counsel requesting the evaluation to obtain these records in advance and have them 
ready at the time the judge signs the order so that the evaluation will not be delayed.  
Within five (5) days of its issuance, counsel must file the order with the Clerk and serve 
the order on the examining agency.  A list of the necessary records is available on the last 
page of the order, and may include: 

  
 
  
  
 
 

Completed DMH/DDSN Outpatient Information Appointment Sheet 
Copy of the indictments(s)  
Copy of the arresting agency’s incident report 
Copy of the warrant(s) 
Law enforcement investigative reports 
The defendant or juvenile’s statements to law enforcement, written or 
electronically recorded 

  Witness statements to law enforcement 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  Mental health records, including inpatient and outpatient evaluation and/or 

Autopsy reports  
Defendant’s school psychological records  
Defendant’s Rule 5(f) notice of insanity records  
Copy of the Juvenile Petition  
Special education records, including psychological evaluations and IEPs  
School records, including disciplinary and attendance records  

treatment  

3.   

Only one Competency to Stand Trial evaluation can be ordered.  For Defendants with 
mental illness, the order is addressed to the Department of Mental Health.  For 
Defendants with an intellectual disability, the order is addressed to the Department of 
Disabilities and Special Needs.  The order may not be addressed to both agencies.  In the 
event there is a dual diagnosis or uncertainty as to the correct diagnosis, the order is first 
addressed to the Department of Mental Health, and the examiners will determine whether 
further referral is necessary.  All orders for criminal responsibility evaluation, regardless 
of the diagnosis, are forwarded to the Department of Mental Health.

This matter is before me for an order requiring defendant _________________________ 

____________________________________________, charged with ______________________ 

______________________________________________________________, to submit to an 

evaluation for competency to stand trial pursuant to State v. Blair, 275 S.C. 529, 273 S.E.2d 536 

(1981) and S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-410 (1976). 

BASIS FOR ORDER.   I have considered the showing made in support of the motion 

requesting  this  evaluation  and  have  reason  to  believe  defendant  may  lack  the  competency  to 

understand the criminal proceedings or to assist with the defense as a result of a lack of mental 

competence.    

This order is issued for the following reasons:  __________________________________ 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:   Defendant shall be examined and observed at an 

appropriate facility by two examiners of the Department of Mental Health if suspected of having 

a mental illness or by two examiners designated by the Department of Disabilities and Special 

Needs if suspected of having an intellectual disability or a related disability, to render an opinion 

SCCA 221 (02/2012) 

2 of 8 

whether defendant is competent to stand trial. 

COMPLIANCE  DEADLINE/TRANSPORT  FOR  EVALUATION.    The  examining 

facility shall schedule the ordered examination no later than thirty (30) days from the examining 

agency’s receipt of this order.  If defendant is currently free on bond or personal recognizance, 

defendant is responsible for making transportation arrangements to attend the examination.   In the 

event defendant does not appear at the scheduled examination, upon written notice of such failure 

by the examining agency to the Sheriff of the county in which this case arose, defendant shall be 

taken into custody by the Sheriff and held until an examination can be scheduled and completed, 

and thereafter shall be released.  Defendant’s bond or bail is hereby revoked to the extent necessary 

to carry out the provisions of this order, and upon completion of the examination and release of 

defendant, any previous bail or bond issued by the Court shall remain in effect.  If defendant is in 

custody at the time of the scheduled examination, the Sheriff is hereby authorized and required to 

transport  defendant  to  and  from  the  examination,  arriving  at  the  examining  facility  at  the  time 

established  by  confirmed  appointment  with  the  staff  of  the  examining  facility.    In  the  event 

defendant is in custody of a law enforcement agency other than a Sheriff’s department, nothing 

herein prevents such agency from carrying out the provisions of this order.      

TRANSFER TO ALTERNATE AGENCY.    If the initial examination is performed by 

the Department of Mental Health, and examiners find indications of an intellectual disability or a 

related  disability  but  not  mental  illness,  the  Department  of  Mental  Health  shall  not  render  an 

opinion on mental competency, but shall inform the Court, prosecutor, and defense counsel that 

defendant is “not mentally ill” and shall provide a copy of such notification and a copy of this 

order to the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs.  Likewise, if the initial examination is 

performed by the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, and examiners find indications of 

mental illness but not an intellectual disability or a related disability, the Department of Disabilities 

and Special Needs shall not render an opinion on mental competency, but shall inform the Court, 

prosecutor,  and defense counsel that defendant does “not have an intellectual disability or a related 

disability” and shall provide a copy of such notification and this order to the Department of Mental 

Health.    

In either case, the examining agency shall make copies of any records gathered or created 

in connection with its examination available to examiners designated by the alternate agency, and 

the alternate agency shall thereafter designate examiners to evaluate defendant as to competency 

SCCA 221 (02/2012) 

3 of 8 

to stand trial within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification from the initial examining agency. 

FINDING OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS.   If examiners of either the Department of Mental 

Health or the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs find an indication of a dual diagnosis 

of mental illness and an intellectual disability or a related disability, no opinion on defendant’s 

mental  competency  shall  be  rendered,  and  the  dual  diagnosis  must  be  reported  to  the  Court, 

prosecutor,  and  defense  counsel.    The  examining  agency  shall  also  provide  notification  of  the 

finding and a copy of this order to the other agency.  Thereafter, the Department of Mental Health 

and the Department  of Disabilities and Special Needs shall arrange for  an examiner from each 

agency to further evaluate defendant to render a final report on defendant’s mental competency. 

Both  agencies  are  authorized  and  required  to  make  copies  of  all  relevant  records  within  their 

possession or control available to examiners for purposes of completing the dual evaluation. 

AUTHORIZATION FOR INPATIENT EVALUATION.  In the event examiners from 

either agency determine defendant requires an inpatient examination, upon written notice to this 

Court from the director of the examining agency or his designee, defendant shall be committed to 

an appropriate facility of the requesting agency for no more than fifteen (15) days for examination 

and observation related to defendant’s mental competency to stand trial.   

REQUEST FOR EXTENSION.  Before the expiration of the examination period or the 

examination  and  observation  period,  the  Department  of  Mental  Health  or  the  Department  of 

Disabilities and Special Needs, as appropriate, may apply to a judge designated by the Chief Justice 

of the South Carolina Supreme Court for an extension of time up to fifteen (15) days to complete 

the examination or the examination and observation.   

DETENTION  BEYOND  EVALUATION  PERIOD.      If,  in  the  judgment  of  the 

designated examiners, defendant is in need of immediate hospitalization or inpatient treatment, 

upon  written  request  to  this  Court  from  the  director  of  the  examining  facility  or  his  designee, 

defendant may be detained by the requesting agency in a suitable facility for so long as deemed 

clinically necessary or until a hearing required and provided by S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-430 (1976) 

may be conducted by this Court.  An additional Court order shall be necessary for ongoing pre-

trial inpatient detention of defendant as discussed in this paragraph.   

ISSUANCE AND ADMISSIBILITY OF WRITTEN REPORT.   Within ten (10) days 

of all examinations or the conclusion of the observation period, a written report shall be made to 

the Court pursuant  to  S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-420 (1976).   A copy of the report shall also  be 

SCCA 221 (02/2012) 

4 of 8 

forwarded to the prosecutor and defense counsel.  This evaluation report shall be admissible as 

evidence  in  subsequent  hearings  pursuant  to  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  44-23-420(c)  (1976);  thus,  the 

report is a statutory exception to the rule against hearsay and shall be admissible without need for 

foundational testimony.  However, the report shall be inadmissible in any other proceedings except 

as expressly permitted by South Carolina law. 

OWNERSHIP AND DISCOVERABILITY OF EXAMINING AGENCY FILES.  The 

examining agency is an independent entity, conducting this evaluation pursuant to Court order, 

and is not aligned with any party before the Court.  To promote full disclosure and to assure the 

cooperation of defendant during the evaluation process, ownership of the examining agency’s files 

shall be vested with the examining agency, including clinician’s notes, staff reports, evaluation 

documents,  memoranda,  test  results,  etc.    Neither  these  files  nor  any  of  their  contents  shall  be 

provided  to  any  party  except  upon  presentation  of  a  Court  order  authorizing  such  or  a  release 

authorization  signed  by  defendant.    In  the  event  the  examining  agency’s  evaluation  opinion  is 

contested, an examiner may be appropriately and fully questioned as to the basis for the examiner’s 

opinion at any hearing pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 44-23-430 (1976).  However, examiners and 

agency staff may not be compelled to testify regarding statements made during the competency 

examination for any purpose other than to establish competency.  Also, statements made during 

the examination may not be used to impeach defendant at trial. Hudgins v. Moore, 337 S.C. 333, 

524 S.E.2d 105 (1999).   

MEDICAL PROVIDERS/SCHOOLS MUST RELEASE NECESSARY RECORDS.  

State  agency  examiners  conducting  the  evaluation  may  need  clinical  and  school  records 

concerning defendant to assist in forming an opinion.  It is therefore ordered, upon presentation by 

the examining agency of this order with a written request for specific records attached thereto, that 

any physician or clinician, licensed health care facility, licensed health care provider, or any school 

district is hereby authorized and required to furnish copies of all records concerning defendant to 

the Department of Mental Health or the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, or both.     

COUNSEL  REQUIRED  TO  FURNISH  NECESSARY  RECORDS.    Upon  written 

request from the examining agency, counsel for the prosecution and defense shall furnish to the 

agency such records and information in counsel’s possession as the agency requests, including but 

not limited to copies of law enforcement reports, investigations, witness statements, statements by 

defendant  (both  written  and  electronic),  defendant’s  medical  records,  and  prior  psychiatric  or 

SCCA 221 (02/2012) 

5 of 8 

psychological evaluations of defendant.  Nothing herein shall be construed to require counsel to 

divulge any information, documents, notes, or memoranda that are protected by attorney-client 

privilege or work-product doctrine. 

DUTIES OF DEFENSE COUNSEL.  Unless the prosecution is the party moving for this 

evaluation, defense counsel has the responsibility to file, serve, and transmit this order as outlined 

in  the  final  paragraph  below.    Defense  counsel  does  not  have  the  right  to  attend  any  clinical 

interview  scheduled  pursuant  to  this  Order,  nor  does  defendant  have  a  constitutional  right  to 

compel counsel’s attendance. State v. Hardy, 283 S.C. 590, 325 S.E.2d 320 (1985).  The Court 

recognizes,  however,  that  circumstances  may  arise  through  which  the  examining  agency  may 

request counsel’s attendance to facilitate the examination.  In the event that such a determination 

is made, the examining agency may request counsel’s attendance in writing, and counsel’s level 

of participation shall be prescribed by the examining agency’s written evaluation protocol.  In this 

event,  because  of  the  substantial  number  of  individuals  awaiting  examination,  such  interviews 

cannot be rescheduled, postponed, or canceled to accommodate counsel except upon presentation 

to the examining agency of a written statement from a circuit court judge that counsel’s attendance 

is required in Court at the time the examination is scheduled.  Whether or not defense counsel is 

requested to attend the clinical interview, defense counsel must meet with defendant prior to the 

interview to discuss this Court order, the evaluation process, the clinical interview, defendant’s 

rights with regard to the clinical interview, and penalties associated with non-appearance and non-

cooperation.    Failure  to  comply  with  these  requirements  may  result  in  sanctions  for  defense 

counsel.  Defendant’s refusal to participate at the interview because of the absence of counsel will 

be deemed non-cooperation.  Failure of defendant to cooperate or participate in the interview may 

result in cancellation of the interview, examiners being unable to offer an opinion on competency 

to stand trial, and the case being called for trial without completion of the evaluation.    

FILING, SERVICE,  AND TRANSMITTAL  OF ORDER.   It  is the responsibility of 

counsel for the party requesting the evaluation to file and serve this order as outlined herein.  In 

the event the evaluation has been requested by consent, or the moving party cannot be determined, 

defense counsel shall be responsible.  After being signed by the Court, the original order without 

attachments shall be immediately filed with the Clerk of Court and a certified copy served upon 

the opposing party.  Further, within five (5) business days, a certified copy of this order, together 

with the attachments listed at the end of this order, must be served upon the examining agency at 

SCCA 221 (02/2012)

the clinical interview, counsel is instructed to immediately contact the examining agency to advise 

of the issuance of this order and forthcoming service upon the agency:
