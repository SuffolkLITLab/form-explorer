COVERSHEET FOR DMH AND DDSN EVALUATION ORDERS 
 

The Competency to Stand Trial Evaluation orders (SCCA 221 and SCCA 487) and the 
Criminal Responsibility (McNaughten) Evaluation order (SCCA 222) should not be 
altered.  It is important for purposes of compliance with the statutes as well as timeliness, 
efficiency and quality control in conducting evaluations that the applicable form order be 
used exactly as published, without alterations or additions to the terms of the form 
order.   

Additional records must be attached to the order for a complete evaluation.  It is the duty 
of counsel requesting the evaluation to obtain these records in advance and have them 
ready at the time the judge signs the order so that the evaluation will not be delayed.  
Within five (5) days of its issuance, counsel must file the order with the Clerk and serve 
the order on the examining agency.  A list of the necessary records is available on the last 
page of the order, and may include: 

Copy of the indictments(s)  

   Completed DMH/DDSN Outpatient Information Appointment Sheet 
 
   Copy of the arresting agency’s incident report 
   Copy of the warrant(s) 
 
 

Law enforcement investigative reports 
The defendant or juvenile’s statements to law enforcement, written or 
electronically recorded 

Autopsy reports  
Defendant’s school psychological records  
Defendant’s Rule 5(f) notice of insanity records  

  Witness statements to law enforcement 
 
 
 
   Copy of the Juvenile Petition  
 
 
  Mental health records, including inpatient and outpatient evaluation and/or 

Special education records, including psychological evaluations and IEPs  
School records, including disciplinary and attendance records  

treatment  

3.   

Only one Competency to Stand Trial evaluation can be ordered.  For Defendants with 
mental illness, the order is addressed to the Department of Mental Health.  For 
Defendants with an intellectual disability, the order is addressed to the Department of 
Disabilities and Special Needs.  The order may not be addressed to both agencies.  In the 
event there is a dual diagnosis or uncertainty as to the correct diagnosis, the order is first 
addressed to the Department of Mental Health, and the examiners will determine whether 
further referral is necessary.  All orders for criminal responsibility evaluation, regardless 
of the diagnosis, are forwarded to the Department of Mental Health.

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
COUNTY OF ________________ 
 
The State of South Carolina, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

_____________________________ 

 
 

Defendant. 
 

  T

his  matter  is  before  me  for  an  order  requiring  defendant  _______________________, 

charged with______________, to submit to an evaluation for criminal responsibility and capacity to 

conform conduct to the requirements of the law on or about _______________ pursuant to S.C. 

Code Ann. § 17-24-10 (1976).  One of the following circumstances applies to the issuance of this 

order: (1) defendant has requested an evaluation to determine whether the insanity defense may 

apply; or (2) prosecution or defendant has requested this evaluation after defendant has affirmatively 

asserted the insanity defense and given appropriate notice pursuant to Rule 5(f) of the South Carolina 

Rules of Criminal Procedure; or (3) both parties by consent request this evaluation regardless of 

whether defendant has asserted the insanity defense. 

BASIS  FOR  ORDER.    I  have  considered  the  showing  made  in  support  of  the  motion 

requesting this evaluation and find defendant’s mental state at the time of the alleged crime(s) will 

likely be at issue in this proceeding. 

This order is issued for the following reasons: 

_______________________________________________________.  

 

THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED:  Because the Department of Mental Health has statutory 

SCCA 222 (02/2012) 

2 of 9 

responsibility for custody and control of individuals determined not guilty by reason of insanity, 

defendant shall be examined and observed at an appropriate facility of the Department of Mental 

Health by one or more examiners to determine whether defendant is criminally responsible pursuant 

to S.C. Code Ann. § 17-24-10(A) (1976) for conduct on or about _________________________. 

If defendant is believed to be criminally responsible by the designated examiners, defendant 

shall be further examined to determine whether, because of mental disease or defect, defendant 

lacked  sufficient  capacity  to  conform  conduct  to  the  requirements  of  the  law  on  or  about                    

 

 

______________________________ pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 17-24-20(A) (1976). 

COMPLIANCE  DEADLINE/TRANSPORT  FOR  EVALUATION.    The  examining 

facility shall schedule the ordered examination as soon as possible and no later than sixty (60) days 

from the receipt of this order by the Department of Mental Health, this time being necessary to gather 

required records.  If defendant  is  currently free on bond or personal recognizance, defendant is 

responsible  for  making  transportation  arrangements  to  attend  the  examination.      In  the  event 

defendant does not appear at the scheduled examination, upon written notice of such failure by the 

Department of Mental Health to the Sheriff of the county in which this case arose, defendant shall be 

taken into custody by the Sheriff and held until an examination can be scheduled and completed, and 

thereafter shall be released.  Defendant’s bond or bail is hereby revoked to the extent necessary to 

carry  out  the  provisions  of  this  order,  and  upon  completion  of  the  examination  and  release  of 

defendant, any previous bail or bond issued by the Court shall remain in effect.  If defendant is in 

custody at the time of the scheduled examination, the Sheriff is hereby authorized and required to 

transport  defendant  to  and  from  the  examination,  arriving  at  the  examining  facility  at  the  time 

established by confirmed appointment with the staff of the examining facility.  In the event defendant 

is in custody of a law enforcement agency other than a Sheriff’s department, nothing herein prevents 

such agency from carrying out the provisions of this order.      

  PROCEDURE IF LACK OF COMPETENCY IS INDICATED.  If, during the course of 

the criminal responsibility and capacity to conform evaluation scheduled pursuant to this Order, the 

examiner finds indications that defendant may not be competent to stand trial pursuant to S.C. Code 

Ann. § 44-23-410 (1976) and State v. Blair, 275 S.C. 529, 273 S.E.2d 536 (1981), the examiner shall 

terminate the criminal responsibility and capacity to conform evaluation, issue no report thereon, and 

SCCA 222 (02/2012) 

3 of 9 

by  written  communication  recommend  to  the Court that a competency to  stand trial  evaluation 

should be ordered.  Further, the examiner should state whether, in the examiner’s opinion, such lack 

of competency is due to a mental illness or, in the alternative, an intellectual disability or a related 

disability.  A copy of this written communication shall be sent to the prosecutor and defense counsel. 

AUTHORIZATION FOR INPATIENT EVALUATION.  In the event examiners from the 

Department of Mental Health determine defendant requires an inpatient examination, upon written 

notice to this Court from the director of the Department of Mental Health or his designee, defendant 

shall be committed to an appropriate facility of the Department of Mental Health for no more than 

fifteen (15) days for examination and observation related to defendant’s criminal responsibility and 

capacity to conform.  If the examination and observation of defendant has not concluded at the end 

of the initial inpatient fifteen (15) days, defendant may be kept in the continued custody of the 

Department of Mental Health for an additional period not to exceed fifteen (15) days, provided the 

director of the examining facility or his designee notifies this Court in writing.  The issuance of an 

additional Court order allowing for the inpatient commitment(s) discussed in this paragraph is not 

necessary. 

DETENTION BEYOND EVALUATION PERIOD.  If, in the judgment of Department of 

Mental Health examiners, defendant is in need of immediate hospitalization or inpatient treatment, 

upon  written  request  to  this  Court  from  the  director  of  the  examining  facility  or  his  designee, 

defendant may be detained by the Department of Mental Health in a suitable facility for so long as 

deemed clinically necessary or until a hearing on the matter may be conducted by this Court.  An 

additional Court order shall be necessary for ongoing pre-trial inpatient detention of defendant as 

discussed in this paragraph.   

ACCESS  TO  EXAMINER’S  REPORT.    The  Department  of  Mental  Health  is  an 

independent entity, conducting this evaluation pursuant to Court order, and is not aligned with any 

party before the Court.  It is the intention of the State of South Carolina to provide defendant an 

adequate  opportunity  for  mental  status  investigation  when  the  defendant’s  mental  condition  is 

seriously in question pursuant to Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087 (1985), either 

before or after defendant formally asserts the insanity defense.  

The purpose of the following provisions controlling access to the examiner’s report is to 

SCCA 222 (02/2012) 

4 of 9 

strike  a balance between defendant’s right  to  explore the possibility of an insanity defense and  

prosecution’s right to respond if such defense is raised.  If defendant is requesting evaluation prior to 

asserting the defense of insanity, the evaluation shall be confidential until such time as defendant 

elects  to  assert  the  insanity  defense.    If  defendant  or  prosecution  is  requesting  evaluation  after 

defendant’s formal assertion of the insanity defense pursuant to Rule 5(f) of the South Carolina 

Rules of Criminal Procedure, or both parties are requesting the evaluation by consent, the evaluation 

shall not be confidential and both defense counsel and the prosecutor shall be provided a copy of the 

examiner’s report.  In either case, ownership of the examining agency’s files shall be vested with the 

examining agency.   

(A) 

Ex parte evaluation requested by defendant prior to assertion of insanity defense. 

If defendant has requested an evaluation to determine whether the insanity defense may be 

viable, the examiner’s report shall not be provided to the prosecution and shall not be admissible as 

evidence in any Court proceedings.  The prosecution may not discover any portion of the evaluation 

files.  Any written report resulting from the evaluation shall be considered confidential and provided 

only  to  defense  counsel,  and  shall  be  provided  within  ten  (10)  days  of  all  examinations  or  the 

conclusion of the inpatient examination period.  Examiners and agency staff may not be compelled to 

testify  regarding  statements  made  during  the  criminal  responsibility  and  capacity  to  conform 

examination for any purpose unless and until defendant asserts the defense of insanity.  However, as 

a condition of accepting the evaluation provided by the State of South Carolina, defendant expressly 

waives any and all confidentiality privileges associated therewith if defendant subsequently asserts 

the insanity defense.  In such case, the evaluation shall no longer be confidential, and all parties’ 

access to the evaluation report shall be controlled by paragraph (B) below.    

(B) 

Evaluation requested by either party after assertion of insanity defense. 

 

Because the assertion of the insanity defense places defendant’s mental status at issue, either 

party may discover any portion of the evaluation files upon presentation of a Court order authorizing 

such or a release authorization signed by defendant.  Both the prosecutor and defense counsel shall 

be  provided  a  copy  of  the  examiner’s  report  within  ten  (10)  days  of  the  conclusion  of  all 

examinations  or the  inpatient examination period.  The evaluation  report may be admissible as 

evidence  in  subsequent  hearings  concerning defendant’s criminal  responsibility and capacity to 

SCCA 222 (02/2012) 

5 of 9 

conform.  However, the report shall be inadmissible in any other proceedings except as expressly 

permitted by South  Carolina law.  Examiners and agency staff may not be compelled to testify 

regarding statements made during the criminal responsibility and capacity to conform examination 

for any purpose other than on the issue of criminal responsibility and capacity to conform.  Also, 

statements made during the examination may not be used to impeach defendant at trial. Hudgins v. 

Moore, 337 S.C. 333, 524 S.E.2d 105 (1999). 

(C) 

Evaluation Requested by Consent of Both Parties. 

By consent, the parties may request evaluation at any time, regardless of whether the insanity 

defense has been asserted by the defendant.  The procedures and rules for this examination shall be 

the same as outlined in paragraph (B) above; however, in the event defendant does not assert the 

insanity defense, the examiner’s report shall not be admissible for any reason, nor shall the contents 

of the evaluation files be used for any purpose.    

 

MEDICAL PROVIDERS/SCHOOLS MUST RELEASE NECESSARY RECORDS.  

Department of Mental Health examiners conducting the evaluation may need clinical and school 

records  concerning  defendant  to  assist  in  forming  an  opinion.    It  is  therefore  ordered,  upon 

presentation by the Department of Mental Health of this order with a written request for specific 

records attached thereto, that any physician or clinician, licensed health care facility, licensed health 

care provider, or any school district is hereby authorized and required to furnish copies of all records 

concerning defendant to the Department of Mental Health.   

COUNSEL  REQUIRED  TO  FURNISH  NECESSARY  RECORDS.    Upon  written 

request from the Department of Mental Health, counsel for prosecution and defense shall furnish to 

the agency such records and information in counsel’s possession as the agency requests, including 

but not limited to copies of law enforcement reports, investigations, witness statements, statements 

by defendant (both written and electronic), defendant’s medical records, and prior psychiatric or 

psychological evaluations of defendant.  Nothing herein shall be construed to require counsel to 

divulge  any  information,  documents,  notes,  or  memoranda  that  are  protected  by  attorney-client 

privilege or work-product doctrine. 

DUTIES OF DEFENSE COUNSEL.  Unless the prosecution is the party moving for this 

evaluation, defense counsel has the responsibility to file, serve, and transmit this order as outlined in 

SCCA 222 (02/2012) 

6 of 9 

the final paragraph below.   Defense counsel does not have the right to attend any clinical interview 

scheduled pursuant to this Order, nor does defendant have a constitutional right to compel counsel’s 

attendance. State v. Hardy, 283 S.C. 590, 325 S.E.2d 320 (1985).  The Court recognizes, however, 

that circumstances may arise through which the Department of Mental Health may request counsel’s 

attendance  to  facilitate  the  examination.    In  the  event  that  such  a  determination  is  made,  the 

Department of Mental Health may request counsel’s attendance in writing, and counsel’s level of 

participation shall be prescribed by the Department of Mental Health’s written evaluation protocol.  

In this event, because of the substantial number of individuals awaiting examination, such interviews 

cannot be rescheduled, postponed, or canceled to accommodate counsel except upon presentation to 

the Department of Mental Health of a written statement from a circuit court judge that counsel’s 

attendance is required in Court at the time the examination is scheduled.  Whether or not defense 

counsel is requested to attend the clinical interview, defense counsel must meet with defendant prior 

to the interview to discuss this Court order, the evaluation process, the clinical interview, defendant’s 

rights with regard to the clinical interview, and penalties associated with non-appearance and non-

cooperation.  Failure to comply with these requirements may result in sanctions for defense counsel.  

Defendant’s refusal to participate at the interview because of the absence of counsel will be deemed 

non-cooperation.  Failure of defendant to cooperate or participate in the interview may result in 

cancellation  of  the  interview  and  examiners  being  unable  to  offer  an  opinion  on  criminal 

responsibility and capacity to conform.  Failure to cooperate may further result in the case being 

called for trial without completion of the evaluation, and may result in defendant being prohibited 

from presenting expert testimony on the issue of insanity or waiver of the insanity defense.    

FILING,  SERVICE,  AND  TRANSMITTAL  OF  ORDER.    It  is the responsibility of 

counsel for the party requesting the evaluation to file and serve this order as outlined herein.  In the 

event the evaluation has been requested by consent, or the moving party cannot be determined, 

defense counsel shall be responsible.  After being signed by the Court, the original order without 

attachments shall be immediately filed with the Clerk of Court and a certified copy served upon the 

opposing party.  Further, within five (5) business days, a certified copy of this order, together with 

the attachments listed at the end of this order, must be served upon the Department of Mental Health 

at the address listed below.  To expedite commencement of the evaluation process and scheduling of
