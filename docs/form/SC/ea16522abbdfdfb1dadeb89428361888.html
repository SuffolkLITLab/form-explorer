      <pre>GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL PLAN OF CONSERVATOR 

he Financial Plan will help you protect and manage the Protected Person’s estate.  It is similar to a budget and must be 
tailored for the Protected Person.  The Conservator must revise the Financial Plan as the Protected Person’s needs change.  
The Conservator must provide a copy of the Plan to the Protected Person’s guardian, if any, or to the Protected Person.  
See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-5-423 and the Reporter’s Comments for further guidance. 

he Financial Plan is NOT the same as an Inventory and Appraisement or a Conservator Report.    

  The Inventory and Appraisement, Form# 550GC, is a separate form that must be filed within 30 days of appointment.  

It must be updated if any of the Protected Person’s assets change. 

  The  Conservator  Report  (Forms  #567GC-LF  and  #567GC-SF)  for  an  adult  protected  person  OR  the  Minor 

Conservator Report (Form #568GC) must be filed annually or at other times as the Court may direct.  
 

Why Complete and File a Conservator’s Financial Plan?   A Financial Plan is not required unless otherwise ordered.  
However, if you file one and the Court approves it, you may expend or distribute sums from the estate without further Court 
authorization  for  the  health,  education,  maintenance,  and  support  of  the  Protected  Person  and  his  dependents.    The 
expenditures must, however, be consistent with the prior Court-approved Financial Plan.  In creating a Financial Plan, the 
Conservator should follow S.C. Code Ann. § 62-5-423 and the Reporter’s Comments. 

equirements: 

The plan must be based on the actual needs of the Protected Person and should include steps to develop or restore the 
person's ability to manage his/her property.  It should estimate the duration of the conservatorship and include projected 
expenses and resources.  The Plan should create a plan for the future that is meaningful, easily understood, and presented 
in a simple but complete way. 

tandard of Care expected of Conservator:  The Conservator must: 

  act as a fiduciary.  You are subject to certain standards of care, e.g., the “prudent investor rule.”  See S.C. Code 

 

Ann. §§ 62-5-417 and 62-7-933 for further guidance.  
consider the purposes, terms, distribution requirements and other circumstances when investing or managing the 
Protected Person’s assets. 

  exercise reasonable care, skill and caution. 
 

consider any estate plan that the Protected Person has, including any will, trust, or jointly owned asset. 

INSTRUCTIONS 

ather all of the Protected Person’s financial information and documents.  When more space is needed attach additional 
sheets.  Keep and maintain supporting documents for all receipts, statements, and disbursements. The Court or others may 
request copies at any time, which should be promptly provided. 

.  Give a short explanation of the steps you will take to help the Protected Person learn or regain the ability to manage 
his/her  property  or  finances.  This  may  include  moving  accounts  to  accessible  financial  institutions,  arranging  for  direct 
deposit  of  pension  income,  providing  checks  designed  for  the  visually  impaired,  providing  a  small  account  for spending 
money, arranging for periodic occupational therapeutic activities.   

.  Check the box that best describes who is being cared for with the Protected Person’s assets. 

.  Give the number of dependents for whom care is given. Provide each dependent’s name and other requested information 

(relationship/address). 

.  Estimate the likely length of the conservatorship.  Keep in mind the steps to restore the Protected Person’s ability to 
manage his or her assets or affairs and whether the assets will provide for the present and future care of the Protected 
Person.  Review this after completing Questions 9-13, which should guide you through the adequacy of assets and what 
steps should be taken. Attach additional sheets if needed.  If you want the Court to take a specific action, you must file an 
appropriate pleading.  This can include, but is not limited to a Petition to Sell Real Property or a petition for some type of 
protective arrangement or any other appropriate relief.  

. - 8.  Describe details about the Protected Person’s mental capacity and ability to make decisions.  Allow the Protected 

Person to make reasonable decisions if possible.

6.  Does the Protected Person already have an estate plan in place? The conservator shall take into account any estate 
plan of the Protected Person known to the conservator.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 62-5-414 for further guidance. 

. - 8.  The Conservator is required to allow a Protected Person to be as involved as possible in financial decision-making, 

and is expected to keep the Guardian, if any, and the Protected Person informed.   

 

  7

PART I.  Projected Resources and Expenses: The Conservator is REQUIRED TO LIST AND DESCRIBE the projected 
EXPENSES and RESOURCES of the Protected Person and should be as detailed as possible. The lists include the most 
common entries; however, if the Protected Person has different types of income or expenses, mark through and replace 
where appropriate or attach separate sheets when needed. 

Monthly  Resources:      List  all  expected  sources  of  receipts  or  income  in  this  section  on  a  monthly  basis.    If  a 
A.  
specific category is not applicable, indicate N/A in the amount column. Use the total from Schedule B from the Inventory 
and  Appraisement (Form #550GC) if this  is  your first (initial) financial  plan.  If  you are amending a financial plan that is 
already  in  place,  use  the  current  totals.    See  S.C.  Code  Ann.  §  62-5-414  and  the  Reporter’s  Comments  for  additional 
guidance. 

 

If you complete the financial plan on a computer, the form should automatically calculate the subtotals and totals 
for you.  Check your math.  

B.  
Expenses:  List all expected sources of expenses or disbursements in this section.  Consider only expenses related 
to the Protected Person or his/her dependents. Indicate the disbursements/expenses amount on a monthly average basis.  
If an expense (such as property taxes) is to be paid on an annual basis, divide the amount by 12 to determine the projected 
monthly amount. If an expense (such as insurance) is paid on a quarterly basis, divide the amount by 3 to determine the 
projected monthly amount. 

  The Conservator’s fiduciary duties require the  Protected Person’s assets are properly insured and the Protected 

Person maintains the same standard of living enjoyed before the conservatorship. 

ART II.  Projected Sufficiency of Conservatorship Assets  

.    After  calculating  the  total  monthly  net  income  or  deficit,  check  the  appropriate  box.    If  you  checked  “Yes”  you  have 
determined the Protected Person’s income will provide for his/her present and future needs, so you should skip to the Proof 
of Delivery.  If you checked “No” you determined the Protected Person’s income will not be enough to provide for his/her 
present and future needs, so you will need to continue to the following questions that will guide you on making a plan to 
help provide for the health, education, maintenance and support of the Protected Person through other ways. 
  
10.  Determine whether the Protected Person’s current investments are sufficient to supplement any monthly shortfall or 
loss.  If the Protected Person’s investments are enough to supplement the monthly shortcoming, check the box “Yes” and 
continue to Question 11. 

1.  If  you determined the Protected Person’s current investments are sufficient to make up for a monthly  shortfall,  you 
should determine how many years the current investments will continue to make up for the shortfall.  Enter the number of 
years you anticipate the investments making up the difference.  

12.  Explain to the Court what steps should be taken when the Protected Person’s assets are no longer enough to provide 
for his/her current and future needs. Attach additional sheets if needed.  Describe whether steps must be taken to apply for 
public benefits or sell assets. Explain what your plan is to continue to provide for the Protected Person’s needs. 
 

 

If you want the Court to take a specific action, you must file an appropriate pleading.  This can include, but is not 
limited to a Petition for Sale of Real Property, a petition for some type of protective arrangement, or other appropriate 
relief.  

3.  If the Financial Plan does not follow or changes the Protected Person’s estate plan, explain how and why. If you believe 

altering the estate plan is necessary, explain why change is needed.
