EFORE:   BENDER, P.J.E., KUNSELMAN, J., and COLINS, J.* 

MEMORANDUM BY KUNSELMAN, J.:  

 

FILED:  March 17, 2023 

In this matter, M.F. (Mother) appeals the order terminating her parental 

rights to her three children, N.B., born May 2013, J.B., born July 2014, and 

E.B., born February 2016, pursuant to the Adoption Act. See 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 

2511(a)(2), (5), (8) and (b).   

The  record1  discloses  the  following  factual  and  procedural  history:  

Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth and Families  (“the Agency”)  has 

been aware of the family since May 2013, when N.B was born, and both N.B. 

and Mother tested positive for marijuana.  N.B. was discharged to the care of 

her parents and the family’s case was closed on or about June 13, 2013.  As 

noted above, J.B. was born in July 2014. 

The family next came to the attention of the Agency in February 2016, 

shortly after E.B. was born.  There were concerns regarding Mother’s drug use 

during her pregnancy, as well as Father’s drug use.  Moreover, the family’s

as the joint stipulations entered at the termination hearing.  See infra.

home was unsafe and in deplorable condition.  After the provision of services, 

the case was closed on or about August 7, 2017. 

The Agency most recently became involved with the family on or about 

August  7,  2019.    At  that  time,  the  Agency  received  a  report  indicating 

inappropriate  discipline  and  neglect  of  the  children,  as  well  as  concerns  of 

Father’s drug use.  For two weeks, the Agency was unsuccessful at assessing 

the  home  and  family.    On  or  about  August  20,  2019,  Kellie  Pavilonis,  an 

Agency caseworker, was able to make  contact with both parents, but when 

the  parents  became  verbally  threatening,  she  needed  to  obtain  police 

involvement to gain access to the home.  After the police became involved, 

Ms. Pavilonis was able to see the children, but she was not able to interview 

them or assess the home.   

On  or  about  November  19,  2019,  the  parents  finally  permitted  the 

Agency  to  access  a  part  of  the  home  but  did  not  permit  a  complete  home 

inspection  and  did  not  make  the  children  available  to  be  interviewed.    On 

November  20,  2019,  the  Juvenile  Court  ordered  the  parents  to  complete  a 

drug  screen,  sign  all  releases  of  information,  enroll  the  one  child  in  school, 

provide access to the home and the children, and to assess the home where 

the children were staying.  After the hearing, Father tested positive for THC 

and Mother tested positive for suboxone, cocaine, and THC.  The parents also 

refused to sign all needed releases of information.   

Due to the family’s ongoing instability and parents’ failure to cooperate 

to ensure the children’s safety, the Agency obtained an order for emergency 

- 3 - 

J-S01018-23 

protective  custody  on  November  20,  2019  and  took  legal  custody  of  the 

children.  The children have not return to the care of either parent since that 

time.  At a shelter hearing on November 22, 2019, the children were ordered 

to remain in foster care. 

All three children were adjudicated dependent on December 18, 2019.  

Both parents stipulated to dependency based upon substance abuse issues, 

inadequate  housing,  and  the  fact  that  the  children  were  not  up  to  date 

medically.  At the dependency hearing, both parents were ordered to:  1) have 

drug and alcohol and mental evaluations and participate in random screens; 

2)  obtain  appropriate  housing;  and  3)  have  liberal  supervised  visits  at  the 

Agency. 

Upon removal, the parents were permitted to visit the children in person 

three  days  a  week  prior  to  the  pandemic  shutdown  and  then  visits  went  to 

virtual three times a week.  On May 14, 2020, the children’s foster parents 

were appointed secondary medical and educational decision makers. 

On November 4, 2021,  Agency petitioned to terminate both Mother’s 

and Father’s parental rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(2), (5), (8) 

and  (b).    The  orphans’  court  conducted  an  evidentiary  hearing  on  June  10, 

2022.  Counsel for the parents appeared, although neither Mother nor Father 

was present.  Counsel was present for N.B. and E.B, while separate counsel 

appeared for J.B.  None of the children were present. 

The  parties  first  entered  eleven  joint  stipulations  on  the  record.    The 

Agency  then  presented  the  testimony  from  Mina  Needham,  the  children’s 

- 4 - 

J-S01018-23 

foster care supervisor, and Ms. Pavilonis, the Agency’s caseworker.    By 

order entered December 29, 2021, the court granted the Agency’s petitions.  

Mother  appealed.2    Both  Mother  and  the  orphans’  court  complied  with 

Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925. 

Mother presents the following issue: 

  Did the [orphans’]  court abuse its discretion and/or err 
as a matter of law in concluding that [the Agency] met its 
burden  of  proving  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that 
termination of Mother’s parental rights would best serve the 
needs and welfare of the children pursuant to 23 [Pa.C.S.A.] 
§ 2511(b)? 

Mother’s Brief at 10. 

 

We review this issue mindful of our well-settled standard of review. 

The  standard  of  review  in  termination  of  parental  rights 
cases requires appellate courts to accept the findings of fact 
and  credibility  determinations  of  the  trial  court  if  they  are 
supported  by  the  record.  If  the  factual  findings  are 
supported, appellate courts review to determine if the trial 
court  made  an  error  of  law  or  abused  its  discretion.  A 
decision  may  be  reversed  for  an  abuse  of  discretion  only 
upon  demonstration  of  manifest  unreasonableness, 
partiality,  prejudice,  bias,  or  ill-will.  The  trial  court's 
decision, however, should not be reversed merely because 
the  record  would  support  a  different  result.  We  have 
previously  emphasized  our  deference  to  trial  courts  that 
often have first-hand observations of the parties spanning 
multiple hearings.

J-S01018-23 

Termination  of  parental  rights  is  governed  by  Section  2511  of  the 

Adoption Act, which requires a bifurcated analysis. 

Initially, the focus is on the conduct of the parent. The party 
seeking  termination  must  prove  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence  that  the  parent's  conduct  satisfies  the  statutory 
grounds for termination delineated in section 2511(a). Only 
if the court determines that the parent's conduct warrants 
termination  of  his  or  her  parental  rights  does  the  court 
engage in the second part of the analysis pursuant to section 
2511(b):  determination  of  the  needs  and  welfare  of  the 
child[.] 

In re C.M.K., 203 A.3d 258, 261-262 (Pa. Super. 2019) (citation omitted). 

Here,  the  trial  court  terminated  Mother’s  parental  rights  pursuant 

to Section 2511(a)(2), (5),  (8),  and (b).   Mother concedes that  the Agency 

established by clear and convincing evidence that termination was warranted 

under  Section  2511(a).    Thus,  we  next  consider  her  claim  that  the  Agency 

failed to present clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Section 2511(b). 

Section 2511(b) provides: 

(b)  Other  considerations.--The  court  in  terminating  the 
rights  of  a  parent  shall  give  primary  consideration  to  the 
developmental,  physical  and  emotional  needs  and  welfare 
of the child. The rights of a parent shall not be terminated 
solely  on  the  basis  of  environmental  factors  such  as 
inadequate  housing,  furnishings,  income,  clothing  and 
medical care if found to be beyond the control of the parent. 
With  respect  to  any  petition  filed  pursuant  to  subsection 
(a)(1), (6) or (8), the court shall not consider any efforts by 
the parent to remedy the conditions described therein which 
are first initiated subsequent to the giving of notice of the 
filing of the petition. 

23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(b). 

- 6 - 

J-S01018-23 

This Court has explained that: 

[S]ection  2511(b)  focuses  on  whether  termination  of 
parental  rights  would  best  serve  the  developmental, 
physical,  and  emotional  needs  and  welfare  of  the  child. 
In In re  C.M.S., 884 A.2d 1284, 1287 (Pa. Super. 2005), 
this  Court  stated,  “Intangibles  such  as  love,  comfort, 
security,  and  stability  are  involved  in  the  inquiry  into  the 
needs and welfare of the child.” In addition, we instructed 
that the trial court must also discern the nature and status 
of the parent-child bond, with utmost attention to the effect 
on  the  child  of  permanently  severing  that  bond. Id. 
However,  in  cases  where  there  is  no  evidence  of  a  bond 
between a parent and child, it is reasonable to infer that no 
bond exists. In re K.Z.S., 946 A.2d 753, 762-63 (Pa. Super. 
2008).  Accordingly,  the  extent  of  the  bond-effect  analysis 
necessarily depends on the circumstances of the particular 
case. Id. at 763. 

In re Adoption of J.M., 991 A.2d 321, 324 (Pa. Super. 2010). 

Concerning the bond, the question is not merely whether a bond exists, 

but whether termination would destroy this existing, necessary and beneficial 

relationship. See  C.M.K.,  203  A.2d  at  264  (citation  omitted); see 

also K.Z.S.,  946  A.2d  at  764 (holding  there  was  no  bond  worth  preserving 

where  the  child  had  been  in  foster  care  for  most  of  the  child's  life,  which 

caused  the  resulting  bond  to  be  too  attenuated).    We  add,  the  court  is  not 

required to use expert testimony to resolve the bond analysis but may rely on 

the  testimony  of  social  workers  and  caseworkers.    Z.P.,  994  A.2d  at  1121. 

Finally, we emphasize that “[w]hile a parent's emotional bond with her and/or 

her  child  is  a  major  aspect  of  the §  2511(b) best-interest  analysis,  it  is 

nonetheless  only  one  of  many  factors  to  be  considered  by  the  court  when 

- 7 - 

J-S01018-23 

determining what is in the best interest of the child.”  In re N.A.M., 33 A.3d 

95, 103 (Pa. Super. 2011) (citation omitted). 

Here, the orphans’ court determined that it based its Section 2511(b) 

determination on the “credible testimony” of Ms. Needham and Ms. Pavilonis.  

Orphans’ Court Opinion, 9/30/22, at 3.  The court then noted Ms. Needham’s 

opinion that “she did not think any of the three children would be detrimentally 

affected” if Mother’s parental rights were terminated, as well as her belief that 

the  children  were  more  bonded  to  the  foster  parents  “than  they  are  with 

[Mother.]”   Id. at 7.  

The orphan’s court also credited Ms. Pavilonis’ testimony concerning the 

existence of a bond between the children and Mother.  Ms. Pavilonis testified 

that  the  children  have  a  strong  bond  with  their  foster  parents  and  the 

cessation  of  that  bond  would  be  detrimental  to  the  children.    See  N.T., 

6/10/22, at 18. 

 

After review, we conclude the court did not abuse its discretion when it 

found  that  termination  would  best  serve  the  children’s  needs  and  welfare 

under Section 2511(b).  In arguing that the Agency did not meet its burden, 

Mother  asserts  that,  Ms.  Needham  and  Ms.  Pavilonis  had  only  “observed 

Mother  with  the  Children  a  total  of  three  times.”    Mother’s  Brief  at  20.  

According to Mother, these witnesses presented by the Agency “simply opined 

that termination of [her] parental rights would not have a detrimental impact 

on  the  Children  because  [she]  did  not  visit  consistently,  and  because  the 

- 8 - 

J-S01018-23 

Children  did  not  appear  as  bonded  with  [her]  as  they  appeared  to  be  with 

foster parents.”  Id.  We disagree. 

 

Testimony from Ms. Needham and Ms. Pavilonis regarding the presence 

of  a  parental  bond  was  proper  under  the  pertinent  case  law.    Z.P.,  supra.  

Moreover, as Mother did not appear at the termination hearing, no evidence 

was  presented  to  contradict  their  testimony.    Counsel  for  J.B.  informed  the 

court that J.B. wished to be adopted by his foster parents.  Although counsel 

for N.B. and E.B. did not mention their desire to be adopted, he informed the 

court  that,  unequivocally,  the  children  wished  to  remain  in  foster  care  with 

their brother.  See N.T., 6/10/22, at 61-63.   

As  noted  above,  we  may  not  disturb  the  orphans’  courts  credibility 

determinations when they are supported by the record.  T.S.M., supra.  As 

our review of the record supports the court’s determination that the Agency 

presented clear and convincing evidence, pursuant to Section 2511(b), that 

termination  would  best  serve  the  needs  and  welfare  of  the  children.    We 

therefore affirm the orphans’ court order terminating Mother’s parental rights.
