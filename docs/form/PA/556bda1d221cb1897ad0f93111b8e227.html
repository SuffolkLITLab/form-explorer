      <pre>DIVORCE PROCEDURE 

hese forms are not designed for complicated divorce issues. To deal with these matters, 
you would need additional forms that are not included in these forms and you will need to 
hire  a  lawyer.  Examples  of  a  complicated  divorce  matter  include  a  request  to  divide 
property, receive alimony, payment of lawyers’ fees and expenses, or if your spouse is in 
the  military.  BE  WARNED  THAT  IF  YOU  FAIL  TO  RAISE  A  CLAIM  FOR  
ALIMONY, DIVISION OF PROPERTY, LAWYERS FEES OR EXPENSES IN YOUR 
DIVORCE  COMPLAINT  THAT  YOU  MAY  LOSE  ALL  RIGHT  TO  MAKE    SUCH 
CLAIMS WHEN THE DIVORCE DECREE IS ENTERED.  

TEP ONE: The Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint  

 divorce case is started with the filing of a “Complaint.”  There are two forms that must 
be attached to the Complaint: the “Notice to Defend and Claim Rights” must be attached 
on top, and the “Verification” must be attached on the bottom.  The Complaint is filed in 
the office where legal pleadings are filed.  You must pay the office where legal pleadings 
are filed a filing fee (unless you have been granted the right to proceed In Forma Pauperis, 
and this request would be filed with your Complaint).  The caption at the top of the forms 
includes the county’s name, your name, your spouse’s name, and the docket number given 
to your by the office where legal pleadings are filed.  This caption must be identical on all 
documents filed in your case, not matter who is filing a document. 

How to Complete Step 1 

1.  Complete all three pages of Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint using the detailed 

“Instruction for Forms” as a guide. 

2.  After you have filled out Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint, make two copies 

of. 

3.  Take the original and your two copies to the office where legal pleadings are filed in 
the county in which you are planning to file for divorce (see the “Where Do I File?” in 
the Introduction section of this packet).  The office where legal pleadings are filed will 
time-stamp the original and two copies.  The original will stay in your file in the office 
where legal pleadings are filed but the two copies will be returned to you.  One of the 
copies is for your records, and the other copy must be served on the other party in STEP 
TWO.  

TEP TWO: Service of the Complaint. 

After filing the Notice to Defend, Complaint and Verification, these documents must be 
served on the other party within thirty (30) days of the date they were filed (the date time-

stamped  on  the  document).  If  the  other  party  does  not  live  in  Pennsylvania,  the  time 
requirement is extended to ninety (90) days. If service is not completed within 30 days of 
the date of filing, the Complaint must be reinstated using Praecipe, and re-served. Service 
of  the  Notice  to  Defend,  Complaint  and  Verification  must  be  made  either  by  Personal 
Service,  by  Acceptance  of  Service,  or  by  regular  and  Certified  Mail  return  receipt 
requested, restricted delivery: 

What if Service isn’t made in time? - If you were unable to successfully serve the other 
party within 30 days (or within 90 days if the other party does not live in Pennsylvania), 
then you must complete and file the Praecipe to Reinstate the Complaint. The date you file 
this Praecipe re-starts the clock for service, and you will have another 30 days to serve the 
other party (or 90 days if the other party does not live in Pennsylvania). For example, if 
you file the Praecipe to Reinstate the Complaint on January 1st, then you must serve the 
other party by January 31st. 

How to complete Step 2 

1.  Decide how you are going to serve the other party. Next, determine which form you 
will need, fill in the caption exactly as it appears on Notice to Defend and Divorce 
Complaint, and follow the following instructions: 

Form 3a: Acceptance of Service - Give the other party Notice to Defend and Divorce 
Complaint. After being  given Notice to Defend  and Divorce Complaint, the other party 
signs the Affidavit of Acceptance of Service, Form 3a, stating that he/she has received a 
copy of Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint. 

-OR- 
Form 3b: Service by Mail -  Mail Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint to the other 
party by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery (the post 
office  can  assist  you  in  mailing  a  document  by  certified  mail).  You  must  complete  the 
Affidavit  of  Service  by  Mail,  Form  3b,  stating  that  you  have  mailed  your  spouse  the 
required forms by certified mail. You must also attach the green card receipt received from 
the post office (make a photocopy of this green card for your records, and file the original 
by attaching it to Form 3b). If the certified mail is returned unclaimed, another form of 
service must be used. 

-OR- 
Form 3c: Personal Service – An adult, other than you, a relative of yours, or an employee, 
co-worker of yours, may personally hand Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint to the 
other party (such as the Sheriff, private courier service, or any reliable third party).  The 
person who hands the papers to your spouse must sign a completed Affidavit of Service by 
Personal Service, Form 3c. 

 

 

 

2 

2.  After you have completed either Form 3a, 3b, or 3c (whichever method you chose to 

serve the other party), make one copy. 

3.  File either Form 3a, 3b, or 3c (whichever method you chose to serve the other party) 
with the office where legal pleadings are filed.  Take the original and one copy to the 
office  where  legal  pleadings  are  filed  and  have  each  document  time-stamped.    The 
original will stay in the file in the office where legal pleadings are filed and the copy 
will be returned to you for your records. 

4.  If you are having trouble completing service, you may file a Praecipe to Reinstate the 
Complaint, as many times as you need.  The clock starts from the day it is time-stamped 
in  the  office  where  legal  pleadings  are  filed.    If  you  continue  to  have  problems 
completing service, it is recommended that  you speak to an attorney.  You may not 
proceed until proper service has been made.

HOW TO PROCEED WITH A 3301(c)(1) CONSENT 
DIVORCE: 

STEP THREE: Wait 90 Days from the Date the Notice to 
Defend and Divorce Complaint were Served. 

The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure require both parties to wait ninety (90) days 
from the service of the Complaint before filing the consent forms.  

How to Complete Step 3 

You  must  wait  ninety  (90)  calendar  days  from  the  date  Notice  to  Defend  and  Divorce 
Complaint is served (see Step Two). The date Defendant is served is Day 1 of 90.

you have served Notice to Defend and Divorce Complaint, you must wait ninety (90) 
days before you can file the 3301(c)(1) Affidavit of Consents. 

STEP FOUR: Affidavit of Consent and EITHER Waiver of 
Notice or Notice of Intention to Request Entry of Section 
3301(c) Divorce Decree. 

Affidavit of Consent: After ninety (90) days have passed from the date the Complaint was 
served upon the other spouse and both parties agree to the divorce, both parties may file an 
Affidavit of Consent, declaring that they consent to the divorce. The Affidavit of Consent 
must be filed within thirty (30) days after it is signed and dated. If the parties do not 
file their Affidavit of Consent within thirty days of the date it was signed, the Affidavit of 
Consent must be re-signed and re-filed. 

Notice of Intention OR Waiver of Notice:  In addition to signing and filing an Affidavit of 
Consent, each party could sign and file a Waiver of Notice, OR, either party could mail the 
other party a Notice of Intention to File the Praecipe to Transmit Record Under Section 
3301(c)(1) of the Divorce Code. If both parties sign and file a Waiver of Notice, then either 
party may immediately file a Praecipe to Transmit Record and have the file go to a Judge. 
However, if one party mailed the other party a Notice of Intention to File the Praecipe to 
Transmit Record Under  Section  3301(c)(1)  of the Divorce  Code, then  twenty (20) days 
must pass before you may file the Praecipe to Transmit Record.

If  the  period  of  separation  from  your  spouse  began  on  or  after 
December 5, 2016, you will need to be living separate and apart from 
your spouse for a period of ONE YEAR, before filing your complaint 
in divorce. 

If the period of separation from your spouse began before December 
5, 2016,  you are required to be living separate and apart from  your 
spouse for a period of TWO YEARS, before filing your complaint in 
divorce. 

The previous requirement of the two year separation was amended by 
the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 2016, reducing the separation 
time  requirement  to  one  year  after  the  effective  date  (December  5, 
2016 of the new law. 

INCLUDED 

IF THE PARTIES WERE SEPARATED FOR A TIME PERIOD 
BEFORE  THE  FILING OF THE  COMPLAINT, THAT  TIME 
IN 
IN  THE  APPLICABLE  TIME  OF 
SEPARATION  REQUIREMENT.    THEREFORE,  IF  YOU 
HAVE  ALREADY  BEEN

3301(d)  DIVORCE  IMMEDIATELY  AFTER  FILING  AND 
SERVING  THE  NOTICE  TO  DEFEND  AND  DIVORCE

General Information: Once the parties have been separated for the applicable time period, 
either party may sign and file an Affidavit Under Section 3301(d) of the Divorce Code) 
stating that the parties have in fact been separated for the applicable time period.  Once the 
parties have been separated for the applicable time period and you have filed an Affidavit 
stating that you have been separated for the applicable time period, then a divorce may be 
entered after notice is given to the other party.  In addition to filing and serving the Affidavit 
Under Section 3301(d) of the Divorce Code, with a blank Counter-Affidvait Under Section 
3301  (d)  of  the  Divorce  Code.  You  must  also  serve  the  other  party  with  a  Notice  of 
Intention  to File the  Praecipe to Transmit  Record Under  Section  3301 (c)(2) or Section 
3301  (d)  of  the  Divorce  Code  in  order  for  them  to  have  the  opportunity  to  oppose  the 
divorce or raise claims if they choose to do so. If the other party does not oppose the divorce 
and does not wish to raise additional claims, they do not need to take any action on the 
Counter-Affidavit.  If  this  is  the  case,  a  Divorce  Decree  may  be  issued  after  filing  the 
Praecipe  to  Transmit  Record.  Lastly,  you  cannot  obtain  a  3301(d)  divorce  against  an 
unrepresented  Defendant  if  he/she  is  in  the  military.  Therefore,  if  your  spouse  is  not 
represented by counsel, you must also sign and file an Affidavit of Non-Military Service. 

How to Complete Step 4 

Complete and sign Counter-Affidavit and Notice of Intention to File Praecipe to Transmit 
Record and make two copies of each. 

If your spouse is not represented by counsel and is not in the military, then also complete 
and sign Affidavit of Non-Military Service. Make two copies. 

File  only  Counter-Affidavit,  and  if  applicable,  Affidavit  of  Non-Military  Service  (the 
original of Notice of Intention to File Praecipe to Transmit Record will be served without 
filing, and a copy will be filed in the future). The originals stay in the office where legal 
pleadings are filed, and the copies are returned to you for your records. 

TEP FIVE: Service of the Affidavit Under 3301(d) of the 

Divorce Code, Notice of Intention to Request Entry of Section 
3301(d) Divorce Decree with Counter-Affidavit, and Affidavit 
of Non-Military Service. 

A 3301(d) divorce cannot be completed without proper service of all the required forms. 
Because the other party's consent is not required in order for a divorce to be entered against 
them, it is especially important that all service procedures are strictly followed.

1. 

2. 

3. 

Mail  the  original  Notice  of  Intention  to  File  Praecipe  to  Transmit  Record,  a  copy  of 
Counter-Affidavit, and, if applicable, a copy of Affidavit of Non-Military Service by first 
class mail to your spouse. 

Complete Certificate of Service and mark the appropriate boxes for the documents you 
have mailed to your spouse. Make one copy of the Certificate of Service. 

File Certificate of Service. The office where legal pleadings are filed will time-stamp the 
original and copy. The original stays in your file, and the copy is returned to you for your 
records. 

STEP SIX: Wait 20 days after service of the Affidavit Under 
Section 3301 (d) of the Divorce Code with blank Counter-
Affidavit Under Section 3301 (d) of the Divorce Code. 

Twenty (20) days after serving the Affidavit under Section 3301(d) of the Divorce Code 
with blank Counter-Affidavit, serve the Notice of Intention to File the Praecipe to Transmit 
Record Under Section 3301 (c)(2) or Section 3301 (d) of the Divorce Code or file Waivers 
of the Notice of Intent.   

General Information: The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure require that twenty (20) 
days elapse between serving the Notice of Intention to File the Praecipe to Transmit Record 
Under Section 3301(c)(2) or Section 3301 (d) of the Divorce Code and filing the Praecipe 
to Transmit Record. 

STEP SEVEN: Praecipe to Transmit Record, Divorce Decree, 
and any other forms required by your county. 

Upon the proper service of the above mentioned documents, the divorce may be concluded 
by either party filing with the court a Final Praecipe to Transmit Record.  Attach a copy of 
the Notice of Intention to File the Praecipe to Transmit Record Under Section 3301 (c)(2) 
or Section 3301 (d) of the Divorce Code. Check your records for the exact dates necessary 
to complete the form.  Reminder: The date of execution is the date the form was signed.  
The date of the time-stamp is the date the form was filed 

Additional  forms  are  also  required  by  the  Court,  including  a  proposed  Divorce  Decree.  
You must provide the court with self-addressed and stamped envelopes for you and your 
spouse in order for the court to mail you a copy of final divorce decree. 

Other  forms  not  mentioned  or  provided  by  these  forms  and  instructions  may  also  be 
required  in  order  to  proceed  with  your  divorce.    Check  with  the  Court  Administrator’s 
Office, office where legal pleadings are filed or the other similar office in the county in 
which  you  filed  your  divorced  proceeding  to  see  if  your  county  requires  any  other 
documents. 

 

15 

Call the Court Administrator’s Office in your county to determine if your county requires 
any documents not herein mentioned or provided to complete a divorce. 

How to Complete Step 7 

Complete Final Praecipe to Transmit Record and make one copy: 
Line 1: 3301(d). 
Line 2: print the date of service and the manner of service (Acceptance, Certified Mail, or 
Personal Service). 
Line 3(b): print the date you signed Counter-Affidavit and then the date you served Counter-
Affidavit with blank Counter-Affidavit Under Section 3301 (d) of the Divorce Code (the date 
on the Certificate of Service). 
Line 4:  print if any claims are pending, and if none, print “no claims pending.” 
Line 5(a):  print the date you served Notice of Intention and blank Counter- Affidavit, and 
attach a copy of same to Final Praecipe to Transmit Record; OR 
Line 5(b): print the date the Waivers of Notice were filed.  
 
Complete Divorce Decree, and any other forms required by your county. Make one copy of 
each. 

File Final Praecipe to Transmit Record and Divorce Decree and any other forms required by 
your county in the office where legal pleadings are filed. The office where legal pleadings 
are filed will time-stamp both the originals and your copies. The originals stay in the file, 
and the copies will be returned to you for your records. 

STEP EIGHT: Divorce Decree 

The Divorce Decree will be mailed to both parties after filing the above forms, presuming 
there are no mistakes.  If corrections need to be made to the paperwork, a final divorce 
decree will not be entered until the court has the corrected paperwork. Some courts may 
contact  you  if  corrections  need  to  be  made,  and  some  courts  will  not,  so  it  is  very 
important that all procedures are followed and all forms are filled out correctly the first 
time! 

How to Complete Step 8 

At some point while your divorce is pending, provide the office where legal pleadings are 
filed two stamped envelopes, one with your current address and one with your spouse’s 
current address, so that the office where legal pleadings are filed can mail copies of your 
Divorce Decree once it is granted.

OPTIONAL FORMS 

HOW DO I REQUEST TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS 
(AND NOT PAY FILING FEES)?:  

If you think you meet the income requirements to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) and be 
excused from paying any costs related to your litigation, then you can request that the Court 
excuse you from paying filing fees. In order to ask for IFP status, you must file a “Petition 
to Proceed In Forma Pauperis and Affidavit” and a “Verification” with Court, in which you 
give the judge detailed information about your financial situation. You should fill out, sign, 
and date the Petition to Proceed In Forma Pauperis and Affidavit and the Verification and 
submit them -- along with the blank order -- to the, Court Administrator’s Office, office 
where legal pleadings are filed, or other similar office to determine how to have the order 
signed by a judge.  Complete the caption exactly as it appears on all the pleadings in your 
case. Make sure that the financial information is complete and accurate, or your petition 
will be denied.  You should keep a copy of  your IFP request for  yourself.  If the Judge 
grants your request, show a copy of your IFP order to the office where legal pleadings are 
filed  every  time  you  file  something  in  your  case.    You  do  have  the  right  to  appeal  the 
judge’s  decision,  but  an  appeal  can  be  complicated  and  having  an  attorney  may  be 
necessary. 

ote: If granted IFP status, that status only applies to YOU, not to the other party in 
the case. If your spouse also wishes to be excused from paying any court costs or filing 
fees, he/she must submit his/her own IFP request. 

How to Request to Proceed In Forma Pauperis (IFP) 

Contact your Court Administrator’s Office for blank copy of the Petition.
