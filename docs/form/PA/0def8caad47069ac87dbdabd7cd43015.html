Protecting the Rights of Older Pennsylvonians

^. tl ^ ^^^

October 22, 2021

Via Electronic Mail

The Honorable Max Baer

Chief Justice

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

Suite 2525, One Oxford Centre

301 Grant Street

Pittsburgh, PA 15219

Dear Chief Justice Baer:

We are grateful for your leadership and write to share information about the challenges facing the courts,

landlords and tenants during the unprecedented residential eviction crisis facing our Commonwealth. In

particular, we write to identify key issues of concern, successes, and outline our support for Alternative Dispute

Resolution tools for Pennsylvania courts to address these challenges.

I write on behalf of SeniorLAW Center, and the over 10,000 older Pennsylvanians we serve each year with free

legal assistance, education and advocacy. Founded 43 years ago, SeniorLAW Center is the only nonprofit in

Pennsylvania dedicated wholly to serving the legal needs of older people and one of a few in the country. We

have been proud to be a member of this Court's Elder Law Task Force and Council on Elder Justice in the Courts

since their founding in 2013.

While families and individuals across our nation and Commonwealth have been devastated by the COVID-19

pandemic, older Americans and older Pennsylvanians have been hardest hit. They have been the most at risk for

the virus, most likely to have severe health consequences, and most likely to die. Housing has never been more

crucial than during this global health crisis, when to be homeless may mean grave illness or death. Issues of

housing are of tremendous importance to the communities we serve. Our work spans a wide universe of civil

legal problems, including landlord/tenant issues. We represent both low-income tenants and landlords, 60 years

of age and older (our clients range into their 100s). Their homes are often also home to multiple generations of

family, including the over 100,000 children that grandparents are raising in Pennsylvania.

CHALLENGES

Courts across Pennsylvania are facing challenging and often unprecedented housing dockets in light of

COVID. Counties are eager to provide access to the influx of Emergency Rental Assistance which

assists both landlords and tenants in these difficult economic times. Alternative Dispute Resolution

(ADR) programs have demonstrated great success as tools for courts to manage dockets to prevent

unnecessary stress on the court system, provide access to this rental assistance, and to resolve cases in a

mutually beneficial way for the parties. ADR programs in residential eviction matters have been

particularly successful, and can be tailored as needs dictate in each county, if authorized by this Court.

Highly successful programs, including that in Philadelphia which has received national acclaim, are

scheduled for expiration on 10/31/2021. We ask this Court to authorize courts across the

Commonwealth to craft their own programs to solve these issues, with no expiration date. A simple rule

from the Supreme Court that expressly authorizes local rulemaking to implement ADR procedures in

eviction proceedings, as proposed here, would provide the clarity needed by President Judges to develop and

implement ADR procedures that are responsive to local needs and the present eviction landscape.

ADR Programs are Supported by Leaders across the Nation and Further Investment in Rental Assistance

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has encouraged all state court Chief Justices to implement

eviction diversion programs that delay or stop eviction proceedings until renters and landlords have

had the chance to apply for rental assistance. (June 24, 2021 letter from Associate AG Gupta.) The

Attorney General and Associate Attorney General also met with over 35 Chief Justices from around

the country to listen to their concerns and discuss ways the federal government can support

implementation of these programs.

Attorney General Garland, Treasury Secretary Gellen, and HUD Secretary Fudge have also expressed

their strong support for these programs and have requested collaboration of Governors, Mayors, County

Executives, and Chief Justices/State Court Administrators to do so (August 27, 2021 letter). Court ADR

programs help leaders and counties with the challenging and disparate processes of distributing rental

assistance, benefitting all.

ADR Programs Benefit Both Landlords and Tenants:

ADR programs not only benefit the courts but both landlords and tenants. For landlords, these programs

ease the access to receipt of rental assistance to ease their economic burdens and streamline the

landlord/tenant process. Unlike most legal services organizations, SeniorLAW Center represents both

low-income older landlords - those often renting a portion of their homes to supplement their low, fixed

incomes, most living solely on social security - and tenants. We have seen firsthand how these programs

benefit landlords, and some have publicly expressed their support.

Current Need for Docket Management:

With courts closed for extended periods of time due to the pandemic, and with thousands of households

waiting to receive rental assistance, Pennsylvania courts face a backlog of eviction filings. ADR has

proven to be an excellent tool for docket management in residential eviction proceedings.

As examples, in Allegheny County, 14,000 rental applications remain pending. In Philadelphia alone,

46,924 rental assistance applications are currently pending. If the Philadelphia Municipal Court Order

expires on 10/31/2021, the court is facing the possibility of 46,924 eviction case filings the first week in

November, which is more than twice the pre-pandemic level of court filings per year (20,000 pre-

pandemic annually). Even if the court went back to pre-pandemic volume of scheduling 1,500

hearings/month, it would take the court almost three years just to schedule all those cases. At the moment

the court is only scheduling half that volume per month, which means it could take even longer for a

landlord to have a hearing.

Pre-Filing Diversion works as a Docket IVIanagement Tool:

The Philadelphia Diversion program is one model ofADR which has been enormously successful and

which has received praise from court leaders, landlords and tenants, the White House, the Department of

Justice, and other jurisdictions around the country. It works as a Docket Management Tool at a time of

overwhelming need.

Philadelphia's Eviction Diversion Program allows the Municipal Court to manage its docket by diverting

cases that can be resolved through access to rental assistance and agreements to pre-filing mediation,

thereby reducing the burden on the courts and allowing those cases which need to be litigated to receive

timely trials. When the court reopened last year there was a 4-month delay between date of filing and the

hearing date, and the delay was growing longer due to more cases being filed than could be

scheduled. Within six months of the Philadelphia order requiring diversion, the court is now able

scheduling hearings within 30 days of filing. Philadelphia has received almost 64,000 rental assistance

applications to date. Without the court order requiring that landlords apply for rental assistance and

participate in diversion pre-filing, those landlords would have inundated the eviction court docket with

over three times the number of annual filings pre-pandemic.

Philadelphia's Eviction Diversion Program is Highly Successful:

Philadelphia's Eviction Diversion Program is a pre-filing program that has been operational for over 1

year now and has received local, state and national attention. Governor Wolf, in his August 2,2021 letter

to Your Honor, called Philadelphia's program "a national model" and shared his belief that "[t]hese sorts

of programs are critical to our success as a state as we emerge from the pandemic, as they provide swifter

relief for struggling families and landlords waiting on rent, and they may be models that would have long-

term benefit to the courts." The DOJ has also held out Philadelphia's program as a national model and the

White House has repeatedly highlighted its success.

The Eviction Diversion program has supported over 2,300 landlord and tenant pairs with over a 90%

success rate in reaching resolution pre-filing. Another 7,000 tenants have been supported in obtaining

rental assistance to resolve the issue without even needing to engage in a mediation. Philadelphia is

leading the nation in distribution of rental assistance, in large part because of the support of Philadelphia's

Eviction Diversion Program and the requirement that landlords access rental assistance prior to filing a

case for non-payment of rent.

ADR programs further ease the burdens of landlords by avoiding eviction and expensive and time-

consuming litigation, delays and appearances. As Governor Wolf noted in his letter of August 2, 2021,

"Evictions are also costly for landlords, through lost revenues and increased transactional costs."15

Opportunities for Other Judicial Districts and Counties to Build Their Own Models

Due to its success, multiple other Pennsylvania counties and jurisdictions around the country have

reached out to Philadelphia to consult on how to build their own diversion programs. Allegheny County,

Montgomery County, Bucks County and Dauphin County have all petitioned this Court for permission to

collaborate with rental assistance and/or diversion and Washington County and Delaware County have

entered their own orders.

Each county is determining what works best for them based on their individualized needs and

resources. Philadelphia's model is a mandatory pre-filing program. Others, such as that in Allegheny,

Bucks, Delaware, Montgomery and Washington Counties, coordinate disbursement of rental assistance

with the court process.

We and other advocates propose a simple state-wide rule change on the use ofADR in residential eviction

proceedings. The proposed rule would give each county the opportunity and authority to create an ADR

system that reflects their community.

246 Pa. Code Rule 216. Local Rules.

The requirements for the promulgation and amendment of local procedural rules for proceedings

in magisterial district courts subject to these rules are set forth in Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial

Administration 103(d).

Notwithstanding this or any other provision of these Rules, the President Judges may, by local

rule, establish and implement Alternative Dispute Resolution processes applicable to

residential eviction proceedings.

Granting Philadelphia's petition for an extension of its Diversion program beyond 10/31/2021 will enable a

nationally-recognized, highly successful program which benefits both landlords and tenants to continue. Giving

counties authority to pursue ADR in residential eviction cases, if they so choose, would be transformative for

Pennsylvania courts, landlords, tenants and families.

We greatly appreciate Your Honor's and this Court's consideration and attention to these vital issues profoundly

affecting our judicial system and Pennsylvania's elders, families, and individuals of all ages.

Very truly yours,

Karen C. Buck
