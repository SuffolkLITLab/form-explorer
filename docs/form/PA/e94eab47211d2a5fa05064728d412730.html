PRESIDENT JUDGE COHN JUBELIRER   

FILED:  March 22, 2023 

Williams Rankins (Rankins), pro se, appeals from the April 30, 2021 Order 

of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  of  Huntingdon  County  (common  pleas),  granting 

Rankins’ Motion for In Forma Pauperis (IFP) Status but dismissing Rankins’ Civil 

Complaint  (Complaint)  as  frivolous  pursuant  to  Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Civil 

Procedure 240(j)(1), Pa.R.Civ.P. 240(j)(1).  Because common pleas granted Rankins 

IFP status, it lost the opportunity to dismiss the Complaint as frivolous under Rule 

240(j)(1).  As a result, the Court is constrained to vacate common pleas’ Order to 

the extent it dismissed this matter as frivolous  and remand this matter for further 

proceedings.

On  December  23,  2020,  Rankins 

filed 

a  Complaint 

against 

COI McConaughey,  COI  Drening,  COI  Boyd,  COI  Park,  COI  Rentz,  COI  Low, 

Superintendent  Luther,  Assistant  Superintendent  Hollidaugh,  and  CO  Grassmyer 

(collectively,  Appellees),  all  of  whom  are  employed  by  the  Department  of 

Corrections  (DOC)  at  the  State  Correctional  Institution  at  Smithfield  (SCI-

Smithfield).  Therein, Rankins alleged that Appellees violated his rights under the 

First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, U.S. 

CONST. amends. I, VIII, XIV.  Specifically, Rankins averred that Appellees violated 

his First Amendment right to access the courts, by withholding legal mail from a 

federal magistrate judge such that by the time it was received, the deadline to file 

objections had nearly run, and it was too late to request additional time.  (Complaint, 

Record  Item  1  at  1.)    Rankins  also  alleged  that  Appellees  engaged  in  cruel  and 

unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment by refusing to provide 

him with two hours of physical recreation time on two occasions and conspiring to 

conduct repeated and unwarranted “pat” searches to harass and humiliate Rankins.  

(Id. at 1-3.)  Rankins also averred Appellee Drening used excessive force by spraying 

him with pepper spray in an unprovoked attack.  (Id. at 3-5.)  Lastly, Rankins avers 

that Appellee Hollidaugh, a grievance officer at SCI-Smithfield, violated his First 

and Fourteenth Amendments by “thwart[ing] [the] administrative process.”  (Id. at 

9.) 

 

On  December  28,  2020,  common  pleas  entered  an  Order  directing,  among 

other  things,  that  “the  Prothonotary  .  .  .  take  no  action  on  this  matter[,]  until 

[Rankins] pays the appropriate filing fee or until he files and is approved for [IFP] 

status.”  (Common Pleas’ December 28, 2020 Order, Record Item 2.)  On January 

21, 2021, Rankins filed a Motion for IFP.  (Motion for IFP, Record Item 3.)  

2 

 

On April 30, 2021, prior to service of the Complaint on Appellees, common 

pleas entered the Order granting Rankins IFP status and dismissing his Complaint 

pursuant to Rule 240(j)(1).  Therein, common pleas states that the Complaint, “lacks 

an arguable basis in law or in fact, and thus does not set forth a valid cause of action.”  

(Common Pleas’ April 30, 2021 Order, Record Item 6, at 1.)  Specifically, common 

pleas held Rankins did not establish Appellees’ action with regard to his mail was 

intentional or that Rankins suffered any injury as a result of the alleged delay.  (Id. 

at 2.)  Common pleas also held that Rankins did not “state clear and specific legal 

bases for his Eighth Amendment claims” or “specify what category of claims he is 

asserting.”  (Id. at 2-3.)  Common pleas stated it “could try to guess what types of 

claims [Rankins] is trying to raise under the Eighth Amendment, but any conclusion 

that might be drawn would be exactly that – a guess.”  (Id. at 3.)  Common pleas 

explained that to do so would “effectively require [it] to act as counsel for [Rankins], 

sifting through his raw allegations to identify what claims might be possible and then 

establish what the elements are[,]” which it declined to do.  (Id.)   

 

Thereafter, Rankins filed his Notice of Appeal with the Pennsylvania Superior 

Court, which subsequently transferred Rankins’ appeal to this Court.  On November 

23, 2021, Appellees filed their Notice of Non-Participation because the matter was 

dismissed  by  common  pleas  as  frivolous  prior  to  service  of  the  Complaint.  This 

matter  is  now  before  this  Court  to  determine  whether  the  trial  court  erred  in 

dismissing Rankins’ Complaint as frivolous under Civil Rule 240(j)(1).1   

Rule 240(j)(1) states: 

 

1 Our review of a trial court’s decision dismissing a matter pursuant to Civil Rule 240(j)(1) 
is “limited to a determination of whether constitutional rights have been violated, [and] whether 
the trial court abused its discretion or committed an error of law.” McGriff v. Vidovich, 699 A.2d 
797, 798 n.2 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1997). 

3 

 

If, simultaneous with the commencement of an action or proceeding or 
the taking of an appeal, a party has filed a petition for leave to proceed 
in forma pauperis, the court  prior to  acting  upon the petition  may 
dismiss the action, proceeding or appeal if the allegation of poverty is 
untrue  or  if  it  is  satisfied  that  the  action,  proceeding  or  appeal  is 
frivolous.   
 

 Pa.R.Civ.P.  240(j)(1)  (emphasis  added).    An  action  is  frivolous  if  it  “lacks  an 

arguable basis either in law or in fact.” Id., Note (quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 

U.S.  319,  325  (1989)).    “In  evaluating  the  legal  sufficiency  of  the  challenged 

pleading,  we  accept  as  true  all  well-pled  material,  and  relevant  facts  alleged  and 

every inference that is fairly deducible therefrom.”  Scrip v. Seneca, 191 A.3d 917, 

923 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018).  When “we review [a pro se] complaint for validity under 

Rule 240. . . [it] should not be dismissed simply because it is not artfully drafted.”  

Ocasio v. Prison Health Servs., 979 A.2d 352, 354 (Pa. Super. 2009) (citing Hill v. 

Thorne, 635 A.2d 186 (Pa. 1993).2  Rather, “the right to amend should be liberally 

granted at any stage of the proceedings unless there is an error of law or resulting 

prejudice to an adverse party.”  Werner v. Zazyczny, 681 A.2d 1331, 1338 (Pa. 1996).   

 

It is not necessary to determine whether Rankins’ Complaint was frivolous or 

whether  he  should  have  been  permitted  to  file  an  amended  pleading  to  cure  the 

alleged deficiencies identified by common pleas.  This is because common pleas had 

already granted Rankins IFP status and thus lost the ability to dismiss the matter as 

frivolous under Rule 240(j)(1).  In Grosso v. Love, 667 A.2d 43 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995), 

the  Court  held  dismissal  under  Rule  240(j)(1)  could  only  occur  before  common 

pleas grants IFP status.  The Court recently reaffirmed this principle in LeBlanc v. 

 

2  While  not  binding,  Superior  Court  decisions  “offer  persuasive  precedent  where  they 
address analogous issues.”  Lerch v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Rev., 180 A.3d 545, 550 (Pa. 
Cmwlth. 2018).   

4 

Wetzel, 286 A.3d 394 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2022).  Accordingly, the Court is constrained to 

vacate common pleas’ Order to the extent it dismissed the Complaint as frivolous 

and remand this matter for further proceedings.
