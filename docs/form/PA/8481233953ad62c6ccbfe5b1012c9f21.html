      <pre>ORDER OF COURT 

AND NOW, this 21st day of August 2020, having previously declared a 

judicial  emergency  in  the  Fifth  Judicial  District  of  Pennsylvania,  this  Court 

further amends its Emergency Operations Order entered on May 28, 2020, as 

amended,  and  orders  that  the  following  actions  be  taken  in  the  Criminal 

Division, pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B) (2): 

 

I. 

REMOTE PROCEEDINGS 

A.  During  the  judicial  emergency,  the  following  matters  in  the  Allegheny 
County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, shall presumptively 
be conducted remotely through Advanced Communication Technology: 

1.  Bail Hearings and Motions Court; 
2.  Motions for Continuance and other motions which do not require 

testimony; 
3.  Guilty Pleas; 
4.  Sentencing Hearings;

DUI  Court,  Mental  Health  Court,  PRIDE  Court,  and  Veteran’s 
Court; 

8.  Probation Violation Hearings; 
9.  SOC Formal Arraignments. 

 

B.  Criminal  Division  proceedings  conducted  by  Advanced  Communication 
Technology shall be conducted primarily through Microsoft Teams. Other 
audio or videoconference methods may be employed with the approval 
of the Administrative Judge.  

 
C.  If  a 

judge 

in  a  particular  case  determines  that  extenuating 
circumstances  exist  that  justify  an  in-person  proceeding,  then  one  of 
the types of matters listed  in paragraph  I(A) above may be heard in-
person,  in  whole  or  in  part,  in  the  courtroom.    Extenuating 
circumstances may exist, for example, when an interpreter is required 
or where there is a likelihood that a sentence of imprisonment will be 
imposed after a guilty plea.  The Court shall make efforts to minimize 
the  number  of  people  present  for  these  in-person  matters  including 
allowing particular attorneys or witnesses to appear remotely.   

D. Recognizing the difficulty that defendants representing themselves may 
have using Advanced Communication Technology, such defendants may 
appear  in  person  for  any  matter  at  the  discretion  of  the  judge. 
Defendants  representing  themselves  may  also  appear  in  person  at 
Formal Arraignment or Pretrial Conferences. 

E.  Remote  matters  conducted 

through  Advanced  Communication 
Technology  shall  be  conducted  with  the  same  decorum  as  in-person 
matters.  

F.  Defense Counsel is encouraged to conduct Formal Arraignments without 
appearing  at  the  Formal  Arraignment  Office  pursuant  to  the  attached 
procedure.

IN-PERSON MATTERS 
 

II. 

A.  Matters not listed in paragraph I(A) of this Order, which would otherwise 
be  conducted  in  person,  may  also  be  conducted  using  Advanced 
Communication Technology after consultation with the parties and if the 
defendant  consents  and  waives  his  or  her  confrontation  clause  rights 
and his or her right to be physically present. This may include matters 
such  as  non-jury  trials  or  pretrial  suppression  motions  in  which 
witnesses will be called. 

 

B.  All persons participating in an in-person court proceeding, including but 
not limited to, judges and judicial officers, attorneys, court employees, 
court reporters, witnesses, and spectators, are required to wear a mask 
or  face  covering  for  the  entire  proceeding.    The  judge  may  permit  a 
person to temporarily remove a mask or face covering to take testimony 
or  where  the  presence  of  a  mask  would  affect  the  ability  to  judge 
credibility, provided that the requirements set forth in the May 28, 2020 
Emergency Operations Plan Order, this Order, and the attached Criminal 
Division Procedures (as may be subsequently amended and posted on 
the website of the Fifth Judicial District) are followed. In such cases, the 
witness  will  be  required  to  wear  a  face  shield.    The  Court  shall  make 
efforts  to  minimize  the  number  of  people  present  for  all  in-person 
matters including allowing particular attorneys or witnesses to appear 
remotely.   

C.  Attorneys are strongly encouraged to only bring essential witnesses and 
participants to in-person court proceedings. Attorneys should encourage 
their clients to refrain from having non-participants accompany them to 
court proceedings.

D. Sidebar conferences are prohibited until further order of court. 

E.  The  Court  shall  continue  to  evaluate  the  circumstances  regarding  the 
pandemic  in  Allegheny  County  to  determine  an  appropriate  time  to 
resume  jury  trials.    A  separate  order  will  set  forth  additional 
requirements relating to resumption of jury trials. 

III.  CONDUCT OF COURT BUSINESS 

A.  Attorneys are to participate in Case Status Conferences as set forth in the 
attached Case Status Conference Procedures.  Judges or their staff may 
also  conduct  status  conferences  via  telephone  or  videoconferencing. 
Attorneys are required to participate in any such status conferences.  

B.  Absent  extenuating  circumstances  unique  to  a  particular  case,  inmates 
will not be transported to the courthouse for proceedings except for trials, 
hearings  on  matters  which  require  witnesses,  and  cases  where  an 
interpreter is necessary for an incarcerated defendant. 

C.  Attorneys are strongly encouraged to file motions (including motions to 
reduce bail), pleadings, and other documents through PACFile. Attorneys 
and self-represented parties shall add  their email address on the cover 
page of all filings with the Court as part of their contact information.  The

proceedings  is  unavailable,  alternative  forms  of  recording  shall  be 
permitted.

and orders shall be permitted.  Such methods may include, but are not 
limited to:

Attorneys  shall  notify  the  Court  of  any  witness  or  client  exhibiting 
symptoms or awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test.  Arrangements shall 
be  made  for  the  person  to  participate  remotely  or  the  matter  shall  be 
postponed. 

Taking  the  testimony  of  witnesses  through  Microsoft  Teams  is  strongly 
encouraged.    However,  when  a  witness  must  testify  in  person  in  a 
courtroom,  attorneys  will  be  responsible  for  management  of  their 
witnesses.  

Witnesses may be required to wait in designated areas of the Courthouse, 
outside  the  Courthouse  or  elsewhere  so  that  social  distancing  may  be 
maintained and  to reduce the amount of people in the courtroom at any 
time. 

Witnesses who wait in the hallways may not congregate and must socially 
distance.   

Attorneys  shall  inform  the  Court  of  the  status  and  location  of  their 
witnesses prior to the start of a proceeding so that the attorneys may be 
given  adequate  time  to  notify  and  call  each  witness  to  testify.    Upon 
conclusion  of  the  testimony,  the  witness  shall  be  excused  from  the 
courtroom  and  shall  leave  the  court  facility  unless  the  judge  or  judicial 
officer determines that there is a reason that the witness must remain in 
the court facility. 

The  taking  of  photographs  or  the  recording  of  any  proceeding  is  strictly 
prohibited.  Anyone violating this provision shall forfeit their cellular phone 
or device and shall be subject to contempt proceedings or other sanctions.  
Notwithstanding, with the permission of the presiding judge, an attorney 
may  use  a  cellular  telephone  to  summon  a  witness  waiting  in  another 
location or for such other purpose authorized by the judge. When a judge 
is on the bench, the attorney shall first request permission from the judge.

ARD Procedures 

After  the  defendant  completes  the  ARD  interview  and  accepts  the  ARD 
offer, the defendant will receive a subpoena from the Court Arraignment 
Office with the hearing date and time noted.  

ARD  Court  staff  will  email  defense  counsel  (or  the  defendant,  if  not 
represented) the ARD Packet with instructions to complete it and return it 
at least 7 days prior to the ARD hearing date. 

ARD Court staff will email an invitation for the Microsoft Teams ARD Hearing 
to both the Defendant and Defense Counsel the week of the ARD hearing. 

The ARD Hearing and Admission into the ARD program will take place as 
scheduled through Microsoft Teams. 

Upon  the  conclusion  of  the  ARD  Hearing  on  Microsoft  Teams,  the  ARD 
Officer and defendants will remain on the Teams call so that the ARD Officer 
may review the ARD rules with the defendants. 

ARD Probation either will complete the intake interview at the conclusion 
of the ARD TEAMS hearing or will contact the defendant approximately one 
week  after  the  hearing.    If  a  defendant  has  not  had  an  intake  interview 
within 14 days of the ARD hearing, please contact the ARD office at 412-

extenuating circumstances exist that justify an in-person proceeding.   

The  Remote  Plea  Packet  should  be  completed  and  sent  to  the  assigned 
courtroom staff two (2) business days before the assigned court date.  The 
protocol during the Plea Hearing via remote access will also be followed.

ll attorneys will be required to engage in an audio and/or video case status 
conference with opposing counsel in every case at least one week prior to the 
next  scheduled  court  date  during  which  the  following  matters  must  be 
addressed: 

  Whether  any  plea  offers  have  been  made;  all  plea  negotiations  must 

occur before the CSC deadline; 
 

  If a plea offer has been made and the defendant intends to reject the 
plea offer and proceed to trial, the rejection of the offer shall be placed 
on  the  record.    The  court,  in  its  discretion,  may  notify  the  defendant 
that, once the plea is rejected and the case is scheduled for trial, the 
Court will no longer accept a negotiated plea; 

  If  a  plea  offer  will  not  be  made,  a  determination  will  be  made  as  to 
whether  the  case  is  ready  to  proceed  to  jury  or  nonjury  trial.    If  the

ounsel shall not send multiple CSC emails on the same case as such emails 
burden the court staff, overwhelm their email accounts and create confusion.  
  
When a matter is scheduled as a remote plea or hearing, all paperwork shall 
be emailed to court staff 48 hours prior to the scheduled plea or hearing date, 
or, in the case of a defendant who is incarcerated, 24 hours prior to the plea 
or hearing date including: 

  Plea Packet 
  Sentencing Guidelines 
  Restitution Form 
  Other forms required for SORNA or Domestic Violence cases 

f a case will be proceeding to trial, the parties are encouraged to stipulate to 
any evidence or testimony, where possible, to avoid the need for witnesses to 
be  called  to  testify.  If  stipulations  may  be  furthered  by  a  party  making  a 
potential  witness  available  via  conference  call  with  all  counsel,  counsel  are 
encouraged  to  utilize  this  method  or  other  similar  opportunities  to  further 
discussions  regarding  possible  stipulations.  Where  stipulations  cannot  be 
reached  regarding  the  testimony  of  a  witness,  the  parties  should  discuss 
whether any witnesses might be permitted to testify via video. 

n a matter which is to proceed remotely, exhibits should be exchanged via 
email  between the  parties at least 24  hours prior to  the  proceeding, with  a 
copy to court staff. If a  party  believes that circumstances exist  that a  prior 
exchange of a particular exhibit should not occur, the issue should be brought 
to the Court’s attention though the Case Status Conference process.    

hen  a  defense  attorney  has  been  unable  to  contact  the  defendant,  the 
Prosecutor shall not bring in any witnesses but shall have them available by 
phone  in  the  event  that  a  previously  “unreachable”  defendant  appears  and 
determines to enter a guilty plea. 

f the defendant then fails to appear on their scheduled court date, a warrant 
shall be issued.  

f  the  defendant  does  appear  on  their  scheduled  date,  the  courtroom  staff 
should  direct  the  defendant  to  the  location  previously  supplied  by  defense 
counsel  so  that  the  defendant  can  make  contact  with  defense  counsel.  The 
case may proceed in a manner that does not require witnesses such as a plea, 
or  a  stipulated  non-jury  trial,  or  other  method  agreed  upon  by  the  parties.

Otherwise, a short defense postponement may be granted with a definite date 
for trial.   

rosecutors shall make every effort to contact their witnesses well in advance 
of  the  scheduled  court  date  and  shall  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the 
Case Status Conferences or status conferences held by judges and their staff.   

hen  a  Prosecutor  has  been  unable  to  contact  a  witness  or  victim,  the 
prosecutor  shall  include  on  any  postponement  request,  the  efforts  made  to 
contact the witness or victim.   

f a Commonwealth postponement is not granted, defense counsel shall not 
bring in any witnesses but shall have the defendant available by phone in the 
event the Commonwealth witness or victim does appear for the proceeding on 
the specified date. 

n the event the Commonwealth witnesses do not  appear  on  the scheduled 
court date, the case may be nolle prossed, dismissed or, at the discretion of 
the judge, a postponement maybe granted on that date.  

f the Commonwealth witness or victim does appear on the scheduled court 
date, the case may proceed in a manner that does not require witnesses such 
as  a  plea,  stipulated  non-jury  trial,  or  other  method  agreed  upon  by  the 
parties.  Otherwise,  a  short  Commonwealth  postponement  shall  be  granted 
with a definite date for trial.   

All defendants without counsel will be required to engage in a CSC with the 
assigned prosecutor consistent with the above procedures. Prior to the CSC, 
the assigned prosecutor will notify the Office of the Public Defender that the 
defendant  is  unrepresented  so  that  the  defendant  can  be  provided  counsel 
from  the  Office  of  the  Public  Defender  or  the  Office  of  Conflict  Counsel  to 
explain the following:  

  The right to counsel for future court proceedings; 
  The right to have counsel appointed if the defendant is unable to afford 

an attorney; and  

  If the defendant elects to proceed pro se, the fact that counsel will serve 

as a third-party witness to ensure the CSC is fairly conducted.
