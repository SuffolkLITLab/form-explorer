NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

IN RE: V.C.-L., A MINOR 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

PPEAL OF: V.C.-L. 

 No. 2332 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Order Entered August 8, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County Juvenile Division 
at No(s):  CP-46-DP-0000092-2022 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., LAZARUS, J., and SULLIVAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY SULLIVAN, J.: 

 

 

     FILED MARCH 17, 2023 

V.C.-L. (“Child”), via her guardian  ad litem (“GAL”), appeals from the 

trial court’s order adjudicating her dependent, insofar as the order does not 

include a finding of child abuse, perpetrated by her parents, K.L.-C. (“Mother”) 

and  A.C.-V  (“Father”),  pursuant  to  the  Child  Protective  Services  Law 

(“CPSL”).1    Following  our  careful  review,  we  vacate  and  remand  with 

instructions. 

The trial court set forth the following factual and procedural history: 

This case was initiated via a [d]ependency [p]etition filed by 
the Montgomery County Office of Children and Youth (“OCY”) on 
June 14, 2022, seeking that [Child] be adjudicated dependent.  An 
[a]mended [d]ependency [p]etition was filed by OCY on July 20, 
2022,  which  added  an  allegation  of  child  abuse  against  both 
[Mother and Father].  A hearing was held before the [trial court]

J-A28033-22 

on  August  1,  2022,  with  th[e]  court’s  [o]rder  of  [a]djudication 
following on August 8, 2022. 

On February 8, 2022, Mother and Father  . . . brought  the 
the  Children’s  Hospital  of 
to 
then  5-month-old  [C]hild 
Pennsylvania  [(“CHOP”)],  King  of  Prussia  Campus.    [Child]  was 
brought in seeking medical care for fussiness and issues related 
to  her  legs.    A  medical  evaluation  was  performed  and  [Child] 
received  a  full-body  x-ray,  also  known  as  a  skeletal  survey.    At 
the time of this initial evaluation, the medical professionals were 
unable  to  determine  the  cause  of  the  original  complaint.    On 
February 11, 2022, [Child] received an MRI to further investigate 
the  cause  of  her  fussiness  and  pain.    The  MRI  showed 
abnormalities in [Child’s] legs, and she was started on antibiotics 
for what was believed to be a bone infection.  A second MRI was 
done on February 16, 2022, which noted abnormalities in the right 
femur, thigh bone, left tibia, and shin bone, ruling out the bone 
infection.    Additional  x-rays  of  [Child’s]  legs  were  taken  on 
February 18, 2022.  These images showed healing fractures in the 
right femur and left tibia. 

. . . Kristin Fortin, [M.D.], a physician at [CHOP] . . . testified 
at the August 1, 2022, hearing as an expert on behalf of OCY.  The 
doctor was consulted on the case after the February 18, 2022[] x-
ray  images  were  taken.    [Dr.]  Fortin  indicated  in  her  testimony 
that the x-rays revealed an oblique fracture in the right femur and 
left tibia.  Although not initially visible, Dr. Fortin noted that once 
the  doctors  saw  evidence  of  the  fractures  on  the  MRI  taken 
February 18, 2022, signs of these fractures were also found visible 
when  looking  back  at  the  February  8,  2022,  x-ray  images.    On 
February 18, 2022, a referral was made to OCY regarding [Child], 
which  triggered  the  eventual  filing  of  the  original  [d]ependency 
[p]etition on June 4, 2022. 

[Dr.  Fortin’s  testimony  established  the  following:    Child 
suffered a broken right femur (thigh bone) and a broken left tibia 
(shin  bone).    See  N.T.,  8/1/22,  at  6,  12.    The  fractures  were 
oblique (i.e., at an angle, as opposed to transverse, which would 
be straight across the bone).  See id. at 16.  An oblique fracture 
can occur if there is “torsion or twisting around the long access of 
the bone,” or if there is a fall that involves twisting.   See id. at 
17.    While  an  older  child,  capable  of  walking,  could  suffer  a 
“non[-]displaced  fracture[]  from  [an]  accident  that  they  would 
cause  themselves,”  Child  was  too  young  to  be  walking,  thus,  it 
was unlikely that she sustained oblique fractures resulting from a 

- 2 - 

fall on her own.  See id. at 17-19.  Child’s injuries similarly could 
not  be  explained  by  a  fall  off  a  bed,  because,  with  “an  infant[,] 
most commonly[,] they hit their head[,] and we see like a skull 
fracture  with  that  type  of  mechanism.    It  would  need  to  be  a 
mechanism  where  it  was  landing  on  the  leg  and  turning  over[,] 
but [that] wouldn’t explain fractures to both legs.”  Id. at 19.]   

Father had previously reported that the night before he and 
Mother brought Child to CHOP, he had been sitting with Child on 
a bed while Mother was in the shower; Child was sitting up on the 
bed with her legs crossed, and then she fell all the way forward, 
and Father purported to hear a “crack,” after which Child began 
abnormally crying.  See id. at 14.  Dr. Fortin opined that, even 
given  Father’s  explanation  for  how  the  injuries  occurred,  there 
was  no  “definite  accident  that  could  explain  everything,”  which 
was why she suspected physical abuse had occurred.  See id. at 
31.    Mother  and  Father  also  indicated  Child  had  participated  in 
physical therapy—for torticollis, i.e., difficulty moving her neck—
the day before they brought her to CHOP.  See id. at 14, 36, 82; 
still,  Dr.  Fortin  opined,  generally  there  was  no  “accidental 
explanation” for Child’s injuries, and, more specifically, she would 
not  expect  Child’s  physical  therapy  to  result  in  these  fractures.  
See id. at 39, 48.  Child did not have a bone infection, vitamin D 
deficiency, or any genetic issues known to result in weak bones.  
See  id.  at  10,  22,  23.    Child  does  have  a  genetic  variant  of 
“unknown significance”; however, it does not play a role in bone 
development  or  bone  health,  but  relates  to  an  issue  with  the 
immune  system  which  makes  infections  more  likely.    See  N.T., 
8/1/22,  at  23-24.    The  hospital’s  rheumatology  team  tested 
Child’s  blood  because,  if  her  genetic  variant  were  causing 
problems  with  her  immune  system,  certain  blood  tests  would 
reflect  an  abnormality;  however,  Child’s  blood  tests  came  back 
normal.  See id. at 24.] 

pon  conclusion  of  the  one-day  hearing  before  the  [trial 
court], an [o]rder . . . was entered adjudicating [Child] dependent, 
with Mother and Father retaining legal and physical custody.  [The 
trial court premised its dependency adjudication on “the fact that 
the  evidence  that  was  presented[,]  regarding  the  physical 
injuries[, was they] would not ordinarily be sustained but for the 
action  or  inaction  of  the  parents[,]  and  [there  was]  really  no 
plausible  explanation  on  how  those  injuries  occurred.”    N.T., 
8/8/22, at 3.]  Th[e] court made the additional finding that [Child] 
would benefit from the services associated with an adjudication of

Trial Court Opinion, 9/19/22, at 2-4 (internal citations to the record omitted).2  

The trial court likewise complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. 

Child raises the following issues for our review: 

1.  Did the lower court err in failing to make a finding of child abuse 
against  [M]other  and  [F]ather[,]  where  the  expert  medical 
testimony presented at the dependency hearing ruled out any 
underlying  medical  condition  as  the  cause  of  .  .  .  [C]hild’s 
injuries, no accident was reported, and [M]other and [F]ather 
presented no evidence to rebut the  presumption against them 
of child abuse under 23 Pa.C.S.[A.] § 6381(d)? 

2.  Was the lower court’s failure to make a finding of child abuse 
against  [M]other  and  [F]ather  against  the  weight  of  the 
evidence[,] where the expert medical testimony presented at 
the  dependency  hearing  ruled  out  any  underlying  medical 
condition as the cause of the child’s injuries, no accident was 
reported, and [M]other and [F]ather presented no evidence to 
rebut  the  presumption  against  them  of  child  abuse  under  23 
Pa.C.S.[A.] § 6381(d)?

determinations  of  the  trial  court  if  they  are  supported  by  the 
record,  but  does  not  require  the  appellate  court  to  accept  the 
lower  court’s  inferences  or  conclusions  of  law.    Accordingly,  we 
review for an abuse of discretion. 

Interest  of  A.C.,  237  A.3d  553,  557  (Pa.  Super.  2020)  (internal  citations 

In her first issue, Child does not contest her dependency adjudication, 

but rather asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to make 

a finding of child abuse against Mother and Father pursuant to the CPSL.  We 

initially note that,  

[although] dependency proceedings are governed by the Juvenile 
Act[,  see  42  Pa.C.S.A.  §§  6301-6475,  the  CPSL]  controls 
determinations  regarding  findings  of  child  abuse,  which  the 
juvenile courts must find by clear and convincing evidence. . . .  
[T]he [Juvenile] Act and the [CPSL] must be applied together in 
the  resolution  of  child  abuse  complaints  under  the  [CPSL,  and] 
reference must be made to the definition sections of both the [Act] 
and the [CPSL] to determine how that finding [of child abuse] is 
interrelated. 
 

As part of [a] dependency adjudication, a court may find a 
parent  [or  caregiver]  to  be  the  perpetrator  of  child  abuse[  ]  as 
defined by the . . . CPSL. . . .. 
 

Interest of G.R., 282 A.3d 376, 380–81 (Pa. Super. 2022) (internal citations, 

quotations, and indentation omitted; some brackets in original).   

The  CPSL  defines  “child  abuse,”  in  relevant  part,  as  “intentionally, 

knowingly or recklessly doing any of the following: (1) Causing bodily injury 

to  a  child  through  any  recent  act  or  failure  to  act.  .  .  ..”    23  Pa.C.S.A. 

- 5 - 

J-A28033-22 

§ 6303(b.1)(1).4  As noted above, the standard of proof for a finding of child 

abuse  pursuant  to  section  6303(b.1)(1)  is  clear  and  convincing  evidence, 

which is “evidence that is so clear, direct, weighty, and convincing as to enable 

the trier of fact to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth 

of  the  precise  facts  in  issue.”    Interest  of  A.C.,  237  A.3d  at  558  (internal 

citation and quotations omitted).  Clear and convincing evidence of abuse is 

established  where  there  are  injuries  that  are  “non-accidental,  not  self-

sustained, and not the result of any bone abnormalities or genetic disorders.”  

Interest of G.R., 282 A.3d at 382.  When a parent contests an allegation of 

child  abuse,  and  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  thereof,  and  offers  an 

explanation for the injury, “the proper issue that must be addressed . . . is 

whether the injuries are entirely consistent with common types of child abuse 

and  inconsistent  with  [the  proffered]  explanation.”    Interest  of  A.C.,  237 

A.3d at 561 (internal citation omitted).   

Child argues the trial court abused its discretion in declining to enter a 

finding of child abuse against Mother and Father, given Dr. Fortin’s testimony 

that the fractures required “some mechanism involving twisting”; Child was, 

at  five  months  old,  not  old  enough  to  walk;  nor  would  a  fall  explain  both 

fractures; nor would Father’s explanation that Child had, while sitting on the 

____________________________________________ 

4  For  the  purposes  of  the  CPSL,  the  terms  “intentionally,”  “knowingly,”  and 
“recklessly” have the same meaning as set forth in 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 302.  See 
Interest of A.C., 237 A.3d at 558 (citing 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6303(a)).

bed, fallen forward onto the mattress account for the fractures.  See Child’s 

Brief at 20.  Child further highlights Dr. Fortin’s testimony that indicated her 

concern for abuse based on the lack of a medical or accidental cause for the 

injuries.  See id.  Given Child’s “serious injuries that could not be attributed 

to an accident or an underlying medical condition,” and that her parents gave 

explanations  which  “could  not  plausibly  have  caused  the  injuries,”  Child 

maintains that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to find abuse.  

Id. at 22. 

relief.  As the court explained: 

The  trial  court  considered  Child’s  issue  and  determined  it  merited  no 

Doctor  Fortin,  the  expert  witness,  indicated  that  the 
fractures  seen  in  [Child’s]  legs  are  more  commonly  found  in 
children  who  are  walking,  as  they  can  be  caused  by  simple 
accidents that occur when in motion.   (N.T., August 1, 2022, p. 
19).    The  [doctor]  stated  that  “we  don’t  expect”  that  type  of 
fracture to occur in a non-walker without a caregiver being aware, 
but she also indicated that they could not look at the x-ray and 
know exactly what happened or when the injury occurred.  ([Id. 
at]  16,  18,  19).    Doctor  Fortin  testified  that  Mother  and  Father 
were  cooperative  with  the  medical  professionals,  and  consistent 
in their recounting of events.  ([Id. at] 39-40). 

The court heard testimony that there was an incident when 
Father  sat  [Child]  up,  and,  while  supported,  [Child’s]  body  fell 
forward so that her head was on the mattress of the bed, at which 
time Father heard a crack.  ([Id. at] 14).  Doctor Fortin testified 
that it would be “unexpected” for the aforementioned incident to 
have caused the injuries.  ([Id. at] 21).  It was also testified to 
that  in  the  month  leading  up  to  February  8,  2022,  [Child]  was 
receiving physical therapy for an unrelated neck issue but that the 
therapy would not  be expected to lead to the fractures suffered 
by [Child].  ([Id. at] 35, 48). 

The Court in In the Matter of Kaitlyn Read stated that “it 
is  an  unwarranted  conclusion  to  find  abuse  simply  because  the 

- 7 - 

J-A28033-22 

parents did not introduce any explanations for the injuries.  The 
evidence  must  show  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the 
children  were  abused.    [In]nuendo  and  suspicion  alone  are  not 
enough to compel a finding of child abuse.”  693 A.2d 607, 611 
(Pa. Super. 1997) (citing In the Interest of J.M., 652 A.2d 877, 
880 (Pa. Super. 1995)).  

Similar to the facts in J.M., the testimony presented before 
the undersigned was only innuendo and suspicion.  The record is 
absent of testimony that would provide a possible incident causing 
or  explanation  for  the  fractures.    [OCY]  failed  to  provide  any 
evidence or theory as to how they could have occurred.  Instead, 
OCY presented evidence to support the fact that the doctors were 
unable  to  explain  the  injuries.    As  opposed  to  using  concrete 
information and fact, OCY used the lack of explanation as support 
for a finding of abuse. 

It is significant to this court, as stated on the record, that 
both  the  OCY  caseworker  and  the  [GAL]  for  [Child]  agreed  that 
she should remain with Mother and Father.  (N.T., August 1, 2022, 
p.  102).    The  OCY  caseworker,  Carol  Robinson,  testified  that  in 
her opinion; 24-hour supervision was unnecessary and the safety 
plan  could  be  lifted.    Ms.  Robinson  indicated  that  Mother  and 
Father were receiving in-home services and willing to voluntarily 
continue with such services.  ([Id. at] 64-65). 

After  careful  review  of  the  evidence  and  testimony 
presented, it is clear to this court that OCY did not meet its burden 
in proving that [Child] was abused by Mother and/or Father. 

Trial Court Opinion, 9/19/22, at 6-8. 

Following our review, we conclude the trial court abused its discretion in 

declining to make a finding of child abuse.  Our review of Dr. Fortin’s testimony 

reveals the following about Child’s injuries: Child suffered a right broken femur 

(thigh bone) and a left broken tibia (shin bone).  See N.T., 8/1/22, at 6, 12.  

The fractures were oblique (i.e., at an angle, as opposed to transverse, which 

would be straight across the bone).  See id. at 16.  An oblique fracture can 

occur if there is “torsion or twisting around the long access of the bone,” or if 

- 8 - 

J-A28033-22 

there  is  a  fall  that  involves  twisting.    See  id.  at  17.    While  an  older  child, 

capable  of  walking,  could  suffer  a  “non[-]displaced  fracture[]  from  [an] 

accident  that  they  would  cause  themselves,”  Child  was  too  young  to  be 

walking, thus, it was unlikely that she sustained oblique fractures because she 

fell  on  her  own.    See  id.  at  17-19.    Child’s  injuries  similarly  could  not  be 

explained by a fall off the bed, because, with “an infant[,] most commonly[,] 

they  hit  their  head[,]  and  we  see  like  a  skull  fracture  with  that  type  of 

mechanism.  It would need to be a mechanism where it was landing on the 

leg  and  turning  over[,]  but  [that]  wouldn’t  explain  fractures  to  both 

legs.”  Id. at 19 (emphasis added).  Father had previously reported that the 

night before he and Mother brought Child to CHOP, 

[M]other  was  in  the  shower.    And  he  was  with  [Child]  on  the 
parent’s  bed,  and  [Child]  was—had  her  legs  crossed.    And  he 
helped her to sit up.  So[,] when he helped her to sit up, she fell 
all the way forward so that her head was onto the mattress.  He

it was abnormal crying. 
 

N.T., 8/1/22, at 14; accord id. at 50 (OCY caseworker explaining that parents 

had related to her the same story).  Dr. Fortin opined that, even given Father’s 

explanation for how the injuries occurred, there was no “definite accident that 

could explain everything,” which was why she suspected physical abuse had 

occurred.    See  id.  at  31.5    Child  did  not  have  a  bone  infection,  vitamin  D

deficiency, or any genetic issues known to result in these fractures.  See id. 

at  10,  22,  23.6    Dr.  Fortin’s  testimony  established  that  Child  suffered  non-

accidental,  non-self-sustained  injuries,  that  did  not  result  from  bone 

abnormalities or genetic disorders.  Thus, OCY carried its burden of proving 

by clear and convincing evidence that Child suffered from abuse.  See, e.g., 

Interest  of  G.R.,  282  A.3d  at  379,  382  (holding  the  agency  met  its 

evidentiary burden where the medical expert testified that, even though she 

could not “opine as to how or exactly when the injuries occurred,” the child’s 

“three acute oblique and buckle leg fractures were  non-accidental, not self-

sustained, and not the result of any bone abnormalities or genetic disorders”); 

see also Interest of A.C., 237 A.3d at 561-62 (affirming a finding of child 

abuse where the injuries were “likely the result of non-accidental trauma and 

prove[n] . . . to be inconsistent with [the parent’s] explanation”).   

The  trial  court  cited  this  Court’s  1997  decision  in  Matter  of  Read  in 

support of its finding that Child was not subjected to abuse.  See Trial Court 

Opinion,  9/19/22,  at  7.    That  case,  however,  is  distinguishable.    There,  an 

that  there  was  no  “accidental  explanation”  for  Child’s  injuries,  and,  more 
specifically, she would not expect Child’s physical therapy to result in these 
fractures.  See id. at 39, 48.  We also observe that Child’s physical therapy 
was for “torticollis,” that is, she had difficulty moving her neck.  See id. at 36. 

 Child does have a genetic variant of “unknown significance,” however, it does 
not play a role in bone development or bone health, but instead relates to an 
issue with the immune system which makes infections more likely.  See N.T., 
8/1/22, at 23-24.

expert  witness’s  testimony  about  injuries  to  two  five-month-old  children 

“clearly indicated that all of these injuries were not representative of the 

classic type of abuse injuries and could have been caused in a number 

of  accidental  ways.    These  injuries  could  have  been  caused  by  other 

children, or adults at any time and under any circumstances.”  See Matter of 

Read,  693  A.2d  at  611  (emphasis  added).    Here,  by  contrast,  Dr.  Fortin 

opined  that  there  were  no  accidental  explanations  for  Child’s  injuries.  See, 

e.g., N.T., 8/1/22, at 39 (Dr. Fortin explaining that “we were concerned that 

there wasn’t a medical or accidental explanation, and there were two fractures 

in an infant, which made us concerned for physical abuse”). The trial court’s 

reliance on our 1995 decision in J.M. is also inapt, as the holding there was 

that proof of abuse of one child did not support allegations of neglect or abuse 

against that child’s siblings.  See J.M., 652 A.2d at 881.  Rather, this case is 

similar to the recently decided decisions in A.C., where a child suffered a likely 

non-accidental injury that was inconsistent with explanations offered by the 

parent, and G.R., where a five-month-old child (as is the case here) suffered 

leg injuries including, as here, oblique fractures.7  Lastly, we note that the trial 

court  explained  “[i]t  is  significant  to  this  court  .  .  .  that  both  the  OCY 

caseworker  and  the  [GAL]  agreed  that  she  should  remain  with  Mother  and 

____________________________________________ 

7  In  G.R.,  the  evidence  established  that  the  oblique  fracture  “most  likely 
occurred from a compression or twisting or torsional force or bending force to 
the leg.”  282 A.3d at 379 (internal citation and quotations omitted).

Father.”  Trial Court Opinion, 9/19/22, at 7.  The trial court’s conclusion that 

this agreement was significant was an abuse of discretion, however, because 

the parties’ agreement that Child should remain with Mother and Father is not 

germane  to  a  finding  of  abuse  on  February  7,  2022.8    In  sum,  OCY  proved 

abuse by clear and convincing evidence, and we conclude that the trial court 

abused its discretion in declining to make a finding of abuse. 

In her second issue, Child argues the trial court committed a legal error 

in declining to apply the rebuttable presumption under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6381(d) 

that  Mother  and  Father  were  the  perpetrators  of  Child’s  abuse.    The  CPSL 

provides: 

Evidence  that  a  child  has  suffered  child  abuse  of  such  a 
nature  as  would  ordinarily  not  be  sustained  or  exist  except  by 
reason  of  the  acts  or  omissions  of  the  parent  or  other  person 
responsible  for  the  welfare  of  the  child  shall  be  prima  facie 
evidence of child abuse by the parent or other person responsible 
for the welfare of the child.  

23  Pa.C.S.A.  §  6381(d).    This  Court  has  explained  the  interaction  between 

section  6303(b.1)(1),  which  governs  a  finding  of  child  abuse,  and  section 

6381(d), which provides for the rebuttable presumption of the identity of the 

perpetrator of abuse, as follows: 

Prima facie evidence is not the standard that establishes the 
child  has  been  abused,  which  must  be  established  by  clear  and 
convincing  evidence;  it  is  the  standard  by  which  the  court 
determines whom the abuser would be in a given case. . . .  The 
Legislature has determined that the likelihood clearly established 

____________________________________________ 

8  We  observe  that  in  G.R.,  notwithstanding  the  trial  court’s  finding  of  child 
abuse  against  the  parents,  the  abused  child  was  permitted,  following  the 
abuse hearing, to resume living with the parents.  See 282 A.3d at 380 n.9.

J-A28033-22 

abuse has occurred, other than at the hands of the custodian, is 
so small that prima facie evidence the custodian has caused the 
injury, either by acts or omissions, is all that is required. . . .  Such 
a standard provides maximum protection for the child victim. . . .  
Thus,  the  Legislature  has  balanced  the  needs  of  society  and 
children  for  protection  against  the  abuser’s  possible  patterned 
behavior and his/her right to freedom unless found guilty beyond 
a reasonable doubt. 

Our  Supreme  Court  reiterated  our  observation  that  the 
Legislature deemed it wise and necessary to establish a different 
evidentiary standard by enacting Section 6381(d)’s presumption, 
to avoid the evidentiary conundrum where the existence of abuse 
is  rather  easily  proven  but  the  court  is  unable  to  assign 
responsibility  for  the  heinous  act  among  the  responsible  adults, 
and to protect children from future abuse. 

Interest  of  A.C.,  237  A.3d  at  558–59  (internal  citations,  quotations, 

brackets,  and  indentation  omitted;  some  ellipses  in  original);  accord 

Interest of C.B., 264 A.3d 761, 771 (Pa. Super. 2021), appeal denied, 270 

A.3d  1098  (Pa.  2022)  (emphasizing  that  the  “likelihood  clearly  established 

abuse has occurred, other than at the hands of the custodian, is so small that 

prima  facie  evidence  the  custodian  has  caused  the  injury,  either  by  acts  or 

omissions, is all that is required”). 

Section 6381(d)’s presumption is rebuttable:  “The parent or responsible 

person  may  present  evidence  demonstrating  that  they  did  not  inflict  the 

abuse, potentially by testifying that they gave responsibility for the child to 

another person about whom they had no reason to fear or perhaps that the 

injuries  were  accidental  rather  than  abusive.”    In  re  L.Z.,  111  A.3d  1164, 

1185 (Pa. 2015).  Where such rebuttal evidence is offered, the trial court must 

- 13 - 

evaluate the validity of the presumption through evaluation of the prima facie 

evidence presented as well as the rebuttal evidence.  See id. 

Child argues that the trial court adjudicated her dependent based on its 

finding,  by clear and convincing evidence, that  her injuries  ordinarily would 

not  exist  except  for  the  acts  or  omissions  of  the  parents—and  this  finding 

activated the rebuttable presumption pursuant to section 6381(d) that Child’s 

parents  had  perpetrated  the  abuse.    See  Child’s  Brief  at  24-25.    Child 

maintains that “the trial court’s legal conclusions were not supported by its 

own  finding  of  fact,  [and,  therefore,  its]  ruling  .  .  .  is  so  contrary  to  the 

evidence so as to shock one’s sense of justice.”  Id. at 25 (emphasis added). 

s  this  court  did  not  make  a  finding  of  abuse  pursuant  23 
Pa.C.S.[A.]  §  6303(b.1)(1),  23  Pa.C.S[.A.]  §  6381(d)  does  not 
apply.  . . .  The court did not find that abuse occurred in this case, 
and thus no further determination needed to be made. 

  A

The trial court explained its ruling as follows: 

rial Court Opinion, 9/19/22, at 8. 

  T

Following our review, we conclude the trial court committed an error of 

law by declining to apply the rebuttable presumption under section 6381(d).  

As  this  Court  has  explained,  section  6381(d)  provides  that  “[p]rima  facie 

evidence is . . . the standard by which the court determines whom the abuser 

would be in a given case.”  Interest of A.C., 237 A.3d at 558–59 (emphasis 

added).  Hence, section 6381(d)’s rebuttable presumption about the identity 

of Child’s abuser(s) is only applicable following a finding of abuse by clear and 

convincing evidence pursuant to section 6303(b.1).  Here, as discussed above, 

- 14 - 

J-A28033-22 

J-A28033-22 

the evidence was sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that 

Child was the victim of abuse.  We further observe that the trial court premised 

its  dependency  adjudication—that  is,  its  finding  by  clear  and  convincing 

evidence grounds for dependency9—on “the fact that the evidence that was 

presented[,]  regarding  the  physical  injuries[,was  they]  would  not  ordinarily 

be sustained but for the action or inaction of the parents . . ..”  N.T., 8/8/22, 

at 3.  The trial court thus made, on the record, the factual finding required to 

trigger  section  6381(d)’s  rebuttable  presumption  that  parents  are  the  ones 

who abused Child.  See 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 6381(d).  At the hearing, Mother and 

Father  both  offered  evidence  and  briefly  testified.    See  generally  N.T., 

8/1/22, at 74-95.  Mother and Father were thus afforded the opportunity to 

offer evidence rebutting the section 6381(d) presumption.  Notwithstanding 

Mother  and  Father’s  evidence,  the  trial  court  found  that  Mother  and  Father 

had offered no plausible explanation for Child’s injuries.  See N.T., 8/8/22, at 

3 (trial court adjudicating Child dependent and further finding that there was 

“really no plausible explanation [for] how those injuries occurred”).  Thus, the 

trial  court  has  already  found  that  Mother  and  Father  failed  to  rebut  section 

6381(d)’s presumption.  Accordingly, the trial court erred as a matter of law 

by failing to identify parents as the perpetrators of Child’s abuse pursuant to 

____________________________________________ 

9See In re G.T., 845 A.2d 870, 872 (Pa. Super. 2004) (nothing the burden 
of proof in a dependency proceeding is on the petitioner to demonstrate by 
clear and convincing evidence that a child meets that statutory definition of 
dependency).

section 6381(d).  Therefore, we vacate the trial court’s August 8, 2022 order 

and remand for the trial court to re-enter the order and include a finding that 

Child is the victim of abuse and that Mother and Father are the perpetrators.  

See In re L.Z., 111 A.3d at 1185; see also Interest of G.R., 282 A.3d at
