NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

ICHAEL SHANE MCCREARY       

 

Appellant 

 No. 420 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered February 23, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County  
Criminal Division at No(s):  CP-21-CR-0002798-2019 

EFORE:   PANELLA, P.J., McLAUGHLIN, J., and PELLEGRINI, J.* 

MEMORANDUM BY PANELLA, P.J.:           FILED: MARCH 16, 2023 

Michael Shane McCreary brings this appeal following the dismissal of his 

petition filed pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S.A. 

§§  9541-9546.  Because  McCreary  is  no  longer  serving  his  probationary 

sentence, we affirm. 

 

In June 2019, McCreary was charged at docket number 0002798-2019 

with multiple counts of firearm violations and sex-related crimes. In exchange 

for McCreary waiving his preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth withdrew a 

felony count of unlawful contact with a minor for the purpose of prostitution.

See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 6318(a)(3). Pursuant to SORNA,1 this crime is a Tier II 

registrable offense. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9799.14(c)(5). 

 

On October 6, 2020, McCreary entered a plea of nolo contendere to one 

misdemeanor count of firearms delivery and one misdemeanor count of false 

reports, “in full satisfaction of all charges” at docket number 0002798-2019. 

The  trial  court  sentenced  McCreary  to  serve  a  term  of  eighteen  months  of 

probation for the firearms delivery conviction and a concurrent term of twelve 

months of probation for the conviction of false reports. McCreary did not take 

a direct appeal. 

 

On October 4, 2021, McCreary file a pro se PCRA petition, and the PCRA 

court  appointed  counsel.  In  his  petition,  McCreary  claimed  that  his  trial 

counsel was ineffective during  the plea process because counsel  improperly 

pressured him to accept the plea for counsel’s convenience. Thereafter, the 

PCRA  court  appointed  counsel  to  McCreary,  and  counsel  filed  two  amended 

PCRA petitions. In the second amended petition, counsel clarified McCreary’s 

[McCreary’s  nolo  contendere]  plea  was  not  knowing,  intelligent 
and voluntary because it was entered into based  upon  incorrect 
information and advice from his attorney. Specifically, his attorney 
told [McCreary] the following: 

.  That [McCreary] could receive a sentence of five years in prison 

if he were convicted after a trial; 

  a

claim:

b.  That [McCreary] would be required to register as a sex offender 

if he were convicted of certain offenses after a trial; 

c.  That  [McCreary]  would  be  charged  with  Intimidation  of  a 
Witness  if  he  did  not  accept  the  plea  being  offered.  The 
possibility of the aforementioned charge being brought against 
[McCreary]  only  arose  a  result  of  [McCreary’s]  attorney 
directing  [McCreary]  to  serve  a  subpoena  on  a  witness. 
[McCreary] served the subpoena as advised by his attorney and 
his contact with the witness resulted in the threat of the charge 
being brought if Petitioner did not accept the plea and; 

d.  That [counsel] was not prepared for a trial and therefore it was 

in [McCreary’s] best interest to accept the plea. 

mended PCRA Petition, filed 2/11/22, at ¶ 10. 

  A

The PCRA court held a hearing on February 22, 2022. On February 23, 

2022, the PCRA court entered an order dismissing  McCreary’s petition. This 

timely  appeal  followed.  The  sole  issue  McCreary  presents  is  whether  trial 

counsel  was  ineffective  in  advising  McCreary  to  enter  his  plea  of  nolo 

contendere,2 which resulted in the plea being not knowingly and intelligently 

entered. See Appellant’s Brief at 8-10. 

 

Our standard of review for an order denying PCRA relief is whether the 

record supports the PCRA court’s determination, and whether the PCRA court’s 

determination is free of legal error. See Commonwealth v. Phillips, 31 A.3d 

J-S44005-22 

____________________________________________ 

2 We note that “[a] plea of nolo contendere, when accepted by the court, is, 
in  its  effect  upon  the  case,  equivalent  to  a  plea  of  guilty.”  Eisenberg  v. 
Commonwealth, 516 A.2d 333, 335 (Pa. 1986) (citation omitted). It is clear 
that  a  criminal  defendant’s  right  to  effective  counsel  extends  to  the  plea 
process, as well as during trial. See Commonwealth v. Allen, 833 A.2d 800, 
802 (Pa. Super. 2003). 

- 3 - 

J-S44005-22 

317, 319 (Pa. Super. 2011). The PCRA court’s findings will not be disturbed 

unless there is no support for the findings in the certified record. See id. 

Before we review the issue raised by McCreary, we must first determine 

whether he is eligible for relief under the PCRA. To do so, we must address 

whether McCreary has satisfied the dictates of the PCRA. Among other things, 

to be eligible for relief under the PCRA, McCreary must plead and prove by a 

preponderance of the evidence that he has been convicted of a crime under 

the laws of this Commonwealth and is, at the time relief is granted, currently 

serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole for the crime.  See 

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(1)(i). 

Our Supreme Court and this Court have consistently interpreted section 

9543(a) to require that a PCRA petitioner be serving a sentence while relief is 

being  sought.  See  Commonwealth  v.  Ahlborn,  699  A.2d  718,  720  (Pa. 

1997); Commonwealth v. Matin, 832 A.2d 1141, 1143 (Pa. Super. 2003). 

As our Supreme Court explained in Ahlborn, the denial of relief for a petitioner 

who has finished serving his sentence is required by the plain language of the 

PCRA  statute.  See  Ahlborn,  699  A.2d  at  720.  To  be  eligible  for  relief  a 

petitioner must be currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or 

parole. See id. To  grant relief at a  time when an appellant  is  not currently 

serving such a sentence would be to ignore the language of the statute. See 

id. 

- 4 - 

J-S44005-22 

Moreover,  we  have  explained  that  “[a]s  soon  as  his  sentence  is 

completed, the petitioner becomes ineligible for relief, regardless of whether 

he was serving his sentence when he filed the petition.” Commonwealth v. 

Williams,  977  A.2d  1174,  1176  (Pa.  Super.  2009)  (citation  omitted).  It  is 

well-settled under Pennsylvania law that the PCRA court loses jurisdiction the 

moment  an  appellant’s  sentence  expires.  See  Commonwealth  v.  Turner, 

80  A.3d  754,  769  (Pa.  2013)  (holding  that  when  a  petitioner’s  sentence 

expires while his PCRA petition is pending before the PCRA court, the PCRA 

court loses jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the petition). 

 

Our review of the record reflects that McCreary invoked the PCRA when 

he filed his pro se PCRA petition on October 4, 2021. However, our review of 

the  record  also  reveals  that  on  October  6,  2020,  the  trial  court  sentenced 

McCreary  to  serve  a  term  of  probation  of  eighteen  months  for  his  firearm 

conviction  and  a  concurrent  term  of  probation  of  twelve  months  for  the 

conviction of false reports. The record further indicates that McCreary began 

serving his term of probation on October 8, 2020. See Pro Se PCRA Petition, 

10/4/21, at 2 (stating “I was sentenced [to probation] on [the] 6th day [of] 

October, 2020 to a total term of 18 months, commencing on [the] 8th day [of] 

October, 2020”). Accordingly, McCreary’s eighteen-month term of probation 

ended on April 6, 2022, and he has finished serving his sentence pertinent to 

the convictions at issue. Hence, McCreary cannot satisfy the requirements of 

the PCRA, and he is currently ineligible to seek further relief pursuant to the 

- 5 - 

PCRA.  See  42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  9543(a)(1)(i);  Ahlborn,699  A.2d  at  720; 

Williams, 977 A.2d at 1176. Consequently, no relief is due. 

Order affirmed.
