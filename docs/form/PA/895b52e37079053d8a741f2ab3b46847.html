      DECIDED: MARCH 21, 2023 

Although this matter arises under our disciplinary docket, it concerns not attorney 

discipline, but rather a point of procedure.  The underlying proceedings took place before 

the  Pennsylvania  Lawyers Fund  for Client  Security,1  an  entity  created  by  this Court  to 

reimburse clients for financial losses caused by their attorneys.  Daryl A. Yount, Esquire, 

an  attorney  involved  in  these  proceedings,  sought  access  to  an  audio  recording  of  a 

hearing conducted on October 19, 2021, before a Hearing Committee appointed by the 

Fund’s  Board  of  Trustees.2    Attorney  Yount  attempted  to  obtain  this  recording  via  the 

subpoena process provided by Pa.R.D.E. 521(c), an effort that the Hearing Committee 

rejected.    Although  we  affirm  the  Hearing  Committee’s  determination  that  Attorney

Hereinafter, the “Board.”

Yount’s  subpoena  was  invalid,  we  do  so  without  prejudice  to  his  ability  to  seek  the 

requested item through other means. 

By way of background, the Fund consists of “contributions of the members of the 

Bar to aid in ameliorating the losses caused to clients and others by defalcating members 

of the Bar acting as attorney or fiduciary.”3  The Fund’s Board investigates applications 

by  injured  clients  (known  as  “Claimants”)  concerning  the  conduct  of  their  attorneys 

(known  as  “Covered  Attorneys”),  and  determines  whether  to  authorize  disbursements 

from the Fund in order to compensate those clients for their losses.4  All such payments 

from the Fund are “a matter of grace and not of right,” and the Rules permit “no appeal 

from  a  decision  of  the  Board”  with  respect  to  disbursements.5    The  Board  is  further 

empowered to appoint hearing committees to investigate claims, as it did here.6 

“All claims filed with the Fund shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed.  This 

confidentiality requirement extends to all documents and things made and/or obtained, 

and all investigations and proceedings conducted and/or held by the Fund in connection 

with  the  filing  of  a  claim.”7    Notably,  Rule  504(d)  exempts  certain  entities  from  the 

confidentiality requirement, allowing the Fund to disclose confidential information to them.  

These  entities  include  the  Office  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  (“ODC”)  and  the  Disciplinary 

Board.8    Covered  Attorneys  are  not  included  within  subsection  (d),  and  thus  are  not 

entitled  to  obtain  confidential  information,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  Fund

proceedings  involve  their  conduct.    Rule  504(e)  goes  on  to  provide,  however,  that 

“[r]equests for the release of confidential information by any person or entity, other than 

those identified in subsection (d), must be made to the Fund through the issuance of a 

subpoena;  requests  for  same  made  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  will  not  be 

The facts giving rise to this matter are not relevant to the issue before us and, in 

any event, are confidential.  It suffices to say that Attorney Yount found himself the subject 

of  a  claim  to  the  Fund,  and  that  he  believes  that  he  may  be  the  subject  of  further 

disciplinary action in the future.  The proceedings before the Fund culminated in a hearing 

before a Hearing Committee on October 19, 2021.  At the beginning of the hearing, the 

Hearing Committee Chair informed those present that there would be no formal transcript 

of  the  testimony,  but  that  the  hearing  was  being  recorded  for  “internal  purposes,” 

specifically the later preparation of a summary of the hearing for the use of the Hearing 

Committee and the Board.10  Attorney Yount did not object to this at the time.  After the 

hearing, however, he sent an email requesting access to the recording.  When his informal 

efforts proved unsuccessful, Attorney Yount sought to compel the Fund to provide him 

2)  At  any  stage  of  an  investigation  and/or  proceeding  under  this 
subchapter,  the  Board  shall  have  the  right  to  summon  witnesses  and/or

with the recording through a subpoena issued under Rule 521(c). 

Rule 521(c) provides, in relevant part:

As the Fund emphasizes, the rules and regulations adopted by the Board provide 
that, with regard to hearings, “[t]here shall be no stenographic record of the proceedings, 
unless  the  Board  determines,  in  its  sole  discretion,  there  is  a  need  for  a  stenographic 
record.”   Board  Rules and  Regulations  3.4(d).   The  Board  is  authorized  to  adopt  such

require production of records by issuance of subpoenas.  Should the Board 
determine to conduct a hearing, the Claimant and/or the Covered Attorney 
may request the issuance of a subpoena to summon a witness to testify at 
such hearing.  The costs associated with the issuance and service of the 
subpoena  and  the  witness’  appearance  shall  be  borne  by  the  requesting 
party.11 

Rule 521(c)(5) further provides that challenges to the validity of a subpoena issued under 

that  Rule  are  to be heard  by  a  hearing  committee  or by  the full  Board, and  that  those 

entities’ determinations are appealable to this Court.12 

 

On November 24, 2021, the Hearing Committee determined that Attorney Yount’s 

subpoena was invalid, adopting the recommendation of the Fund’s counsel.  The Hearing 

Committee’s determination was based primarily upon the fact that, although Rule 521(c) 

allows  a  Covered  Attorney  to  subpoena  a  witness  to  testify  at  a  hearing,  it  does  not 

authorize the attorney to subpoena documents, communications, or recordings created 

during the investigation of a claim.  The Hearing Committee stressed that Attorney Yount 

was informed at the beginning of the hearing that there would be no transcript and that 

the audio recording was being prepared for internal purposes only, and  that he did not 

object at the time.  The Hearing Committee further determined that, under Rule 504, the 

audio recording was confidential because it was made in connection with a claim to the 

Fund,  and  it  recorded  confidential proceedings  conducted  in  furtherance  of  that  claim.  

Although Rule 504(e) refers to the use of a subpoena to obtain confidential information, 

the Hearing Committee concluded that this subsection of the Rule was not intended to

(8)(iii) within ten days after service of the determination on the party bringing the appeal.”).

allow a Covered Attorney to circumvent the confidentiality requirement, and that such a 

reading would compromise the ability of the Fund and the Board to perform its duties. 

Attorney Yount appealed the Hearing Committee’s determination pursuant to Rule 

521(c)(5) by filing a petition for review in this Court.  Following the procedure outlined in 

Rule  521(c)(8)(iii),13  we  issued  a  rule  to  show  cause  upon  the  Fund14  as  to  why  the 

subpoena determination should not be reversed.  The Fund responded, largely reiterating 

the reasons provided by the Hearing Committee.  The Fund further suggested that the 

audio  recording  may  be  protected  by  attorney-client  privilege  and/or the  attorney  work 

product  doctrine.15    After  receiving  the  Fund’s  response,  this  Court  requested  further 

briefing  from  the  parties  and  listed  the  matter  for  oral  argument,  which  we  heard  on 

.  Does  Pa.R.D.E.  504(e)  allow  Yount  to  issue  a  subpoena  against  [the 

Fund] to obtain the October 19, 2021, audio recording? 

2.  Has Yount properly served a subpoena upon [the Fund] to obtain the 
recording pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 521(c)? 

3.  Does [Yount] have a due process right under Pennsylvania law to obtain 
a  copy  of  the  recording  in  his  defense  against  the  ongoing  [ODC] 
investigation?16 

 

Attorney Yount presents three questions for our review:

Upon timely receipt of a petition for review, the Court shall issue a rule to show cause 
upon  the  party  to  the  proceeding  who  is  not  challenging  the  determination,  returnable 
within ten days, why the determination should not be reversed.”). 

Because the Fund is the named respondent, we refer to it, rather than the Board 

14  
or the Hearing Committee, as the relevant party to this appeal. 

15  
The  Fund  did  not  advance  these  privilege  theories  in  its  subsequent  briefing.  
Because we affirm the Hearing Committee’s subpoena determination on other grounds, 
we need not address any claim of privilege, and we offer no comment thereon.

Attorney Yount principally contends that his subpoena was valid and enforceable 

under Pa.R.D.E. 504(e).  He concedes that the audio recording  at issue is confidential 

under Rule 504(a).  However, because Rule 504(e) provides that  requests to the Fund 

for confidential information must be made through a subpoena, and because he obtained 

a subpoena, Attorney  Yount argues that he is entitled to the recording that he sought.  

Attorney  Yount  further  argues  that  he  followed  the  correct  procedure  to  obtain  the 

subpoena and to appeal the Hearing Committee’s subpoena determination to this Court.  

And  finally,  Attorney  Yount  asserts  that  he  has  a  due  process  right  to  use  the  audio 

recording in any future disciplinary proceeding. 

 

The Fund, in response, asserts that Attorney Yount’s appeal is moot because the 

proceedings  before  the  Fund  have  ended,  and  thus  there  remains  no  controversy  to 

resolve.17    If  we  decline  to dismiss the  appeal as moot, then  the  Fund argues  that  we 

should  affirm  the  Hearing  Committee’s  determination  because  the  language  of  Rule 

521(c) makes clear that Attorney Yount only was entitled to subpoena witnesses for the 

hearing, not to use a subpoena to obtain documents produced during the proceedings.  

The fact that Attorney Yount wishes to use the audio recording in any future disciplinary 

proceeding is of no moment, the Fund argues, and does not impact the validity, or lack 

thereof,  of  a  subpoena  issued  under  Rule  521(c).    In  any  event,  the  Fund  highlights, 

Attorney Yount is not without recourse in any future disciplinary proceeding, because the 

Rules  of  Disciplinary  Enforcement  provide  another  source  of  subpoena  authority  that, 

unlike Rule 521(c), applies to such proceedings. 

                                            
17  
In addition to advancing this argument in its brief, the Fund requested dismissal of 
this  appeal  on  mootness  grounds  in  a  separate  filing  entitled  “Application  for  Relief  of 
Respondent  the  Pennsylvania  Lawyers  Fund  for  Client  Security  for  Suggestion  of 
Mootness.”  In light of our disposition of the appeal, we dismiss this application as moot. 

 
[J-77-2022] - 6 

Resolution of this matter turns upon our interpretation of the Pennsylvania Rules 

of Disciplinary Enforcement.  Our review is plenary, and “to the extent we must engage 

in . . . analysis  of  our  own  procedural  rules,  we  apply  conventional  interpretative 

principles.”18  These interpretive principles include familiar tools of statutory construction. 

As  a 

threshold  matter,  we  reject 

the  Fund’s  suggestion  of  mootness.  

Notwithstanding  that  the  proceedings  before  the  Fund  have  concluded,  the  parties’ 

dispute over the audio recording remains extant.  “An issue before a court is moot when 

a determination is sought on a matter which, when rendered, cannot have any practical 

effect on the existing controversy.”19  Were we to reverse the determination of the Hearing 

Committee  and  conclude  that  Attorney  Yount’s  subpoena  was  valid,  there  would  be  a 

practical effect—enforcement of the subpoena.  Accordingly, regardless of whether there 

is any business remaining before the Fund vis-à-vis the claim that brought Attorney Yount 

before it, there remains a live controversy that necessitates our resolution. 

 

We agree with the Fund, however, on the merits of the dispute.  Notwithstanding 

Attorney Yount’s references to Rule 504(e), it is undisputed that he sought the subpoena 

at issue under Rule 521(c).  The relevant portion of that Rule bears repeating: 

t any stage of an investigation and/or proceeding under this subchapter, 
the  Board  shall  have  the  right  to  summon  witnesses  and/or  require 
production  of  records  by  issuance  of  subpoenas.    Should  the  Board 
determine to conduct a hearing, the Claimant and/or the Covered Attorney 
may request the issuance of a subpoena to summon a witness to testify at 
such hearing.20

As the text makes plain, both the Board and the Covered Attorney (Attorney Yount) 

are permitted to obtain subpoenas in connection with proceedings before the Fund.  But 

the  scope  of  that  subpoena  authority  differs.    The  Board  has  the  right  to  “summon 

witnesses and/or require production of records.”  The Covered Attorney, by contrast, may 

only  request  a  subpoena  “to  summon  a  witness  to  testify”  at  a  hearing.    By  expressio 

unius est exclusio alterius,21 the fact that the Rule spells out one particular purpose for 

which the Covered Attorney may request a subpoena necessarily implies that the other 

purpose is excluded.  This distinction is particularly clear given the close proximity of the 

language providing the Board, but not the Covered Attorney, with the authority to require 

“production of records.” 

Attorney Yount’s subpoena was only valid for the purpose of summoning witnesses 

to  testify  at  a  hearing.    He  attempted  to  use  it  to  require  the  production  of  an  audio 

recording.  For this reason alone, the Hearing Committee did not err in determining that 

Attorney Yount’s subpoena was invalid. 

None  of  Attorney  Yount’s  arguments  to  the  contrary  are  meritorious.    Although 

Attorney Yount presently relies upon Rule 504(e), the fact remains that he obtained the 

subpoena under Rule 521(c).  Rule 521(c) is the only authority listed on the subpoena 

and, as Attorney Yount goes to the trouble of arguing in his brief, he followed the review 

procedures  specified  in  Rule  521(c).    In any  event,  Rule 504(e)  is not  an  independent 

source of subpoena power.  It does not authorize anyone to obtain a subpoena.  Rather, 

Rule 504(e) merely provides that the Fund will not release confidential information to any

person or entity not listed in Rule 504(d) absent a subpoena.22  Rule 504(e) in no way 

remedies the facial defect in Attorney Yount’s subpoena issued under Rule 521(c). 

As for Attorney Yount’s invocation of due process, we  discern no such violation.  

Attorney  Yount  offers  only  rote  citation  of  the  proposition  that  procedural  due  process 

requires  “adequate  notice,  opportunity  to  be  heard,  and  the  chance  to  defend  oneself 

before a fair and impartial tribunal having jurisdiction over the case.”23  Although Attorney 

Yount  explains  how  he  wishes  to  use  the  audio  recording  in  a  future  anticipated 

disciplinary  proceeding,  he  makes  no  effort  to  establish  that  he  has  been  deprived  of 

notice and an opportunity to be heard in the present case.  Indeed, one of the issues that 

Attorney Yount presented in this appeal consists solely of an averment that he followed 

the correct procedures to obtain review of the subpoena and the Hearing Committee’s 

subpoena determination.24  There is no credible assertion that Attorney Yount has been 

denied the process to which he was due at any stage of this matter. 

 

We  cannot  speak  to  any  disciplinary  proceedings  at  this  juncture,  as  they  lie 

outside the scope of this appeal.  We do note, however, that although Rule 521(c) does 

not  permit  Attorney  Yount  to  obtain  a  subpoena  requiring  the  production  of  records  in

Information Act will not be honored.”).

To  the  extent  that  this  issue  requires  discussion,  we  do  not  differ  with  Attorney 
Yount’s assertion that he followed the procedures outlined in Pa.R.D.E. 521(c) and has 
obtained the appropriate review.  This is, however, irrelevant to the question of whether 
he is entitled to relief. 

 
[J-77-2022] - 9 

connection with a proceeding before the Fund, there is another Rule that more directly 

applies to the disciplinary proceedings that are the subject of Attorney Yount’s concern.  

Rule 213(a)(1) provides that, “[a]t any stage of an investigation, both Disciplinary Counsel 

and  a  respondent-attorney  shall have  the  right  to  summon  witnesses  before a hearing 

committee  or  special  master  and  require  production  of  records  before  the  same  by 

issuance of subpoenas.”25  We further note that counsel for the Fund represented to this 

Court at oral argument that the Fund has preserved the audio recording during the course 

of  this  litigation,  and  we  trust  that  the  parties  can  reach  an  arrangement  whereby  the 

recording  will  continue  to  be  preserved  until  such  a  time  that  Attorney  Yount  either 

attempts to obtain it or determines that he no longer desires it.  Accordingly, although we 

affirm the subpoena determination below, we do so on the narrow grounds that Attorney 

Yount’s  subpoena  was  invalid  under  Rule  521(c),  and  we  do  so  without  prejudice  to 

Attorney Yount’s ability to seek access to the audio recording under Rule 213 or by any 

other mechanism available to him under the law. 

The Hearing Committee’s determination is affirmed. 

Chief Justice Todd and Justices Donohue, Dougherty, Mundy and Brobson join the 

opinion.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
