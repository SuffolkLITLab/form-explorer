pandemic. 

 In accordance with the extension of the judicial emergency through and including 
June 30, 2021 ordered after consultation with state, regional and local medical experts, 
review of the CDC and Pennsylvania Department of Health guidelines, and in compliance 
with the spirit of Governor Wolf and the Secretary of Health’s orders, We promulgate the 
following  procedures  for  the  43rd  Judicial  District  effective  immediately,  amending  and 
replacing the operational protocols promulgated in this Court’s Administrative Orders: 89 
A.D. on September 2, 2020; 85 A.D. on June 12, 2020 and 83 A.D. on May 29, 2020.

accommodations will be made. Only persons who appear on lists provided to the

CDC  and  PA  DOH  guidelines,  recommendations  and  Orders  and  this  Court’s

full extent possible, separate times or time frames/ranges will be set

iii.  For GTM hearings, an invitation will be sent to the District Attorney, 
JPO,  and  the  Juvenile’s  attorney  of  record.  If  there  has  been  a

hearing, the attorney of record will be responsible for forwarding the

ARD WAIVER AGREEMENT 

I understand that I have a constitutional right to a speedy trial. I also understand

I also understand that the case against me will be prosecuted if I violate any of 

terms of my probation as set forth in the Order of Court, and in the Statement of which I 

agree to execute if accepted into the ARD Program. To facilitate the speedy disposition of 

my case should I violate any of those terms, having been advised of offense charged 

against me and of my rights, I consent to proceed upon these should they be listed for trial 

as a result of my violation of probation, and waive any rights which I may otherwise have 

concerning being placed twice in jeopardy. 

I further understand that if within the next ten years, I am convicted of the crime of

past ten years, nor have I been placed on ARD for DUI within the past ten years. 

I further certify that there are no pending prosecutions against me in this or any
