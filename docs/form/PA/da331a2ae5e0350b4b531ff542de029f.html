ODNEY WILLIAM GARY       

 

Appellant 

 No. 2635 EDA 2021 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered August 13, 2021 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-23-CR-0001201-2018 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., LAZARUS, J., and SULLIVAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY SULLIVAN, J.: 

 

 

      FILED MARCH 20, 2023 

 

Rodney William Gary (“Gary”) appeals from the judgment of sentence 

imposed  after  he  pleaded  nolo  contendere  to  aggravated  assault  by  vehicle 

while  driving  under  the  influence  (“DUI”),  driving  under  the  influence, 

possession of a controlled substance, and related offenses.1  Gary’s counsel 

(“Counsel”) has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 

(1967),  and  Commonwealth  v.  Santiago,  978  A.2d  349  (Pa.  2009),  and 

petitioned to withdraw.  We deny Counsel’s petition.  

 

We  summarize  the  factual  history  of  this  appeal  from  the  affidavit  of 

probable cause, which the parties incorporated into the record of Gary’s nolo 

contendere  pleas.    See  Criminal  Complaint,  Affidavit  of  Probable  Cause, 

12/30/17, at 1; see also N.T., 10/29/19, at 15-16 (memorializing the parties’

stipulations  to  the  affidavit  of  probable  cause,  the  results  of  all  chemical 

testing,  and  Gary’s  driving  history  as  stating  the  factual  bases  for  Gary’s 

pleas).    In  the  morning  of  December  30,  2017,  Upper  Darby  Police  Officer 

James Friel received a dispatch about a vehicle striking a pedestrian, and was 

among  the  officers  to  respond.    When  Officer  Friel  arrived  at  the  accident 

scene,  he  observed  a  man  on  the  ground  with  open  wounds  and  possible 

broken bones.  One witness reported that the driver had struck two stop signs 

and then hit the pedestrian, after which the driver stopped, briefly got out of 

his vehicle, and then drove away from the scene.  The witness identified the 

vehicle as a white Dodge Durango and gave officers its license plate number.  

The witness described the driver as a black male.   A second witness stated 

that he was walking toward the accident scene when he heard people yelling 

to stop a vehicle, and he took pictures of the driver and the vehicle’s license 

plate.  See Criminal Complaint, Affidavit of Probable Cause, 12/30/17, at 1.   

Officer  Friel  patrolled  the  area  and  later  found  the  Dodge  Durango 

double-parked by a building.  He saw a man later identified as Gary, in a green 

jacket  walking  away  from  the  vehicle.    Upon  seeing  the  officer,  Gary 

immediately went into the building.  Officer Friel and another officer entered 

the building and found Gary.  The officer brought Gary outside where one of 

the  witnesses  from  the  accident  scene  identified  him.    A  woman  told  police 

that she saw Gary discard a pink bottle inside the building.  An officer returned 

to the building and recovered a bottle containing six pills, which later chemical 

testing  identified  as  alprazolam  (“Xanax”).    Police  investigated  the  Dodge 

- 2 - 

J-A28042-22 

Durango and noticed the smell of burnt marijuana inside the vehicle.  Officers 

contacted  the  Durango’s  registered  owner,  who  told  them  she  had  double-

parked the vehicle to go to an appointment while Gary remained in the car.  

Police took Gary into custody, and he consented to a blood test.  See id.       

The Commonwealth charged Gary with numerous offenses related to the 

hitting the pedestrian while DUI and his possession of Xanax.  On October 29, 

2019,  Gary,  who  was  represented  by  different  counsel  at  the  time  (“prior 

counsel”),  entered  nolo  contendere  pleas.    The  trial  court  accepted  Gary’s 

pleas  and  deferred  sentencing.    Following  continuances  and  status 

conferences  during  the  COVID-19  emergency,  Gary’s  prior  counsel  filed  a 

motion  to  withdraw  from  representation.    The  trial  court  granted  prior 

counsel’s motion and appointed current Counsel.   

Gary, through Counsel, filed a motion to withdraw his nolo contendere 

pleas and asserted his innocence.  See Motion to Withdraw Nolo Contendere 

Pleas, 5/27/21, at 2.  Gary denied driving the vehicle at the time it struck the 

pedestrian  and  argued  that  the  eyewitness  identifications  were  unreliable.  

See  id.    He  further  asserted  the  Commonwealth  could  not  prove  that  he 

possessed the bottle the police recovered in the building.  See id.  Following 

a hearing, the trial court denied Gary’s motion to withdraw his pleas in July 

2021,  and  held  a  sentencing  hearing  on  August  13,  2021.    The  trial  court 

imposed an aggregate sentence of four to eight years of imprisonment.  Gary 

timely  filed  a  post-sentence  motion  again  requesting  to  withdraw  his  nolo 

contendere pleas.  The trial court denied Gary’s post-sentence motion.  Gary 

- 3 - 

J-A28042-22 

timely appealed, and Counsel filed a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(c)(4) statement of intent 

to file an Anders brief.  The trial court determined that no further explanation 

of Gary’s conviction and sentence was necessary and did not prepare a Rule 

1925(a) opinion.  As noted above, Counsel has filed an  Anders brief and a 

petition to withdraw from representation.      

When  presented  with  an Anders brief,  this  Court  may  not  review  the 

merits  of  the  underlying  issues  without  first  passing  on  the  request  to 

withdraw.   See Commonwealth  v.  Garang,  9  A.3d  237,  240  (Pa.  Super. 

2010).  Pursuant to Anders, when counsel believes an appeal is frivolous and 

wishes to withdraw from representation, he must do the following: 

(1)  petition  the  court  for  leave  to  withdraw  stating  that  after 
making  a  conscientious  examination  of  the  record,  counsel  has 
determined the appeal would be frivolous; (2) file a brief referring 
to any issues that might arguably support the appeal, but which 
does not resemble a no-merit letter; and (3) furnish a copy of the 
brief to the defendant and  advise him of his right to retain new 
counsel, proceed pro se, or raise any additional points he deems 
worthy of this Court’s attention. 

Commonwealth  v.  Edwards,  906  A.2d  1225,  1227  (Pa.  Super.  2006) 

(internal citation omitted).  In  Santiago, our Supreme Court addressed the 

second  requirement  of Anders, i.e.,  the  contents  of  an Anders brief,  and 

required that the brief: 

(1) provide a summary of the procedural history and facts, with 
citations  to  the  record;  (2)  refer  to  anything  in  the  record  that 
counsel  believes  arguably  supports  the  appeal;  (3)  set  forth 
counsel’s  conclusion  that  the  appeal  is  frivolous;  and  (4)  state 
counsel’s  reasons  for  concluding  that  the  appeal  is  frivolous.  
Counsel should articulate the relevant facts of record, controlling 

- 4 - 

J-A28042-22 

case law, and/or statutes on point that have led to the conclusion 
that the appeal is frivolous. 

Santiago,  978  A.2d  at  361.    “Once  counsel  has  satisfied  the  [Anders] 

requirements, it is then this Court's duty to conduct its own review of the trial 

court's proceedings and render an independent judgment as to whether the 

appeal  is,  in  fact,  wholly  frivolous.” Edwards,  906  A.2d  at  1228  (citation 

omitted). 

Here,  Counsel  avers  in  his  petition  to  withdraw  that  he  conducted  a 

thorough and conscientious review of the record and applicable case law, and 

thereafter determined that there are no meritorious grounds to support Gary’s 

appeal.  Counsel further avers that he mailed Gary copies of the petition and 

the Anders brief, as well as correspondence explaining Gary’s rights to retain 

private  counsel  or  proceed pro  se and  raise  any  additional  arguments  he 

believes are meritorious.  Counsel’s Anders brief includes a summary of the 

facts and procedural history of the case, a list of issues that could arguably 

support Gary’s appeal, and  Counsel’s  analysis of why the issues  lack merit.  

We  conclude  Counsel  has  complied  with  the  technical  requirements  of  the 

Anders  procedure.    Accordingly,  we  will  conduct  an  independent  review  to 

determine whether Gary’s appeal is wholly frivolous. 

Counsel identifies the following issue for review: 

Whether  [trial  court]  erred  as  a  matter  of  law  and  abused  its 
discretion,  in  denying  [Gary’s  motion  to  withdraw]  his  nolo 
contendere plea, which was filed by [Gary] prior to sentencing. 

Anders Brief at 2.   

- 5 - 

J-A28042-22 

 

The  following  principles  govern  our  review.    The  right  to  withdraw  a 

guilty  or  nolo  contendere  plea  is  not  absolute.    See  Commonwealth  v. 

Carrasquillo, 115 A.3d 1284, 1291 (Pa. 2015); see also Commonwealth 

v.  Norton,  201  A.3d  112,  114  &  n.1  (Pa.  2019)  (noting  that  the  same 

standards apply to pre-sentence motions to withdraw a guilty plea or a nolo 

contendere  plea).    The  trial  court  must  construe  a  pre-sentence  motion  to 

withdraw a plea “liberally in favor of the accused” and “any demonstration by 

a  defendant  of  a  fair-and-just  reason  will  suffice  to  support  a  grant,  unless 

withdrawal  would  work  substantial  prejudice  to  the  Commonwealth.”    See 

Carrasquillo,  115 A.3d  at  1292  (internal  citation  omitted).    The  trial  court 

may  exercise  its  discretion  when  considering  whether  an  assertion  of 

innocence constitutes a fair and just reason for a pre-sentence withdrawal of 

a  plea.    See  Norton,  201  A.3d  at  120.    A  defendant’s  bare  assertion  of 

innocence will not establish a fair and just reason to withdraw a plea per se.  

See  id.    The  trial  court  may  consider  the  credibility  or  plausibility  of  a 

defendant’s assertion of innocence when assessing whether the defendant has 

offered  a  colorable  claim  that  the  withdrawal  of  the  plea  would  promote 

fairness and justice.  See id. at 120-21.  

An  appellate  court  reviews  the  trial  court’s  decision  for  an  abuse  of 

discretion.  Thus,  

[w]hen a trial court comes to a conclusion through the exercise of 
its discretion, there is a heavy burden on the appellant to show 
that this discretion has been abused.  An appellant cannot meet 
this burden by simply persuading an appellate court that it may 
have reached a different conclusion than that reached by the trial 

- 6 - 

J-A28042-22 

court; rather, to overcome this heavy burden, the appellant must 
demonstrate that the trial court actually abused its discretionary 
power.  An abuse of discretion will not be found based on a mere 
error  of  judgment,  but  rather  exists  where  the  trial  court  has 
reached  a  conclusion  which  overrides  or  misapplies  the  law,  or 
where the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the 
result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will.  Absent an abuse of 
that discretion, an appellate court should not disturb a trial court's 
ruling.  

Id. at 120 (internal citations, quotations, and brackets omitted).   

 

In  the  case  sub  judice,  our  review  of  the  record  reveals  that  the  trial 

court did not enter findings of fact or conclusions of law concerning its denial 

of Gary’s pre-sentence  motion to withdraw his  nolo contendere pleas either 

on the record at the hearing, in a separate order, or in a Rule 1925(a) opinion.  

As emphasized by our Supreme Court, an appellate court’s role is to review 

the trial court’s exercise of discretion when denying a pre-sentence motion to 

withdraw  a  plea.    See  id.    The  absence  of  a  trial  court  opinion,  under  the 

circumstances of this appeal, impedes proper appellate review, and we decline 

to  consider  Counsel’s  independent  assessment  that  this  appeal  is  frivolous 

without  the  benefit  of  the  trial  court’s  discussion  of  its  findings  of  fact, 

determinations of credibility, and conclusions of law.    

 

Accordingly, we deny Counsel’s petition to withdraw from representation 

and direct the trial court to prepare a supplemental opinion within forty-five 

days of  this decision addressing  its  denial of Gary’s pre-sentence motion  to 

withdraw.  This Court shall thereafter set a new briefing schedule during which 

Counsel  shall  file  an  advocate’s  brief  or  a  new  petition  to  withdraw  and  an

brief.   

retained.   

  
 

____________________________________________ 

2  We  add  that  while  Counsel  extensively  discussed  the  Commonwealth’s 
evidence  against  Gary,  including  references  to  a  preliminary  hearing 
transcript, the certified record does not indicate that the preliminary hearing 
transcripts were admitted as evidence in connection with Gary’s pleas or his 
motion to withdraw his pleas.  Moreover, the certified record does not contain 
a  copy  of  that  transcript  or  any  other  evidence  the  Commonwealth  used  to 
establish  a  factual  basis  for  the  pleas  aside  from  the  affidavit  of  probable 
cause.  Counsel shall ensure that the record includes all information necessary 
for  this  Court  to  render  a  decision  upon  issuance  of  the  trial  court’s 
supplemental opinion.
