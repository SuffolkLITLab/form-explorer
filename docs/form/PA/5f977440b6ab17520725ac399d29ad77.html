OPINION NOT REPORTED 

EMORANDUM OPINION BY 

JUDGE CEISLER  

 

 

 

 

FILED:  March 21, 2023 

 

Before  this  Court  are  an  Application  for  Summary  Relief  filed  by  Charles 

Talbert  and  a  Cross-Application  for  Summary  Relief  filed  by  the  Department  of 

Corrections and George Little (together, DOC)1 in this Court’s original jurisdiction.  

Because we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and 

DOC’s right to relief is clear, we deny Mr. Talbert’s Application for Summary Relief 

and grant DOC’s Cross-Application for Summary Relief. 

Background 

 

On  December  18,  2019,  the  Philadelphia  County  Court  of  Common  Pleas 

(Trial Court) sentenced Mr. Talbert to 29 months to 60 months’ incarceration for 

possessing  an  instrument  of  crime,  followed  by  a  consecutive  sentence  of  1  to  2 

years’  incarceration  for  recklessly  endangering  another  person.    The  sentencing

order states in relevant part:

redit  for  time  served  if  applicable  on  this  case.    Sentence  is 
consecutive  to  any  other  sentence  being  served.    Court  recommends 
[State Correctional Institution (SCI)-]Waymart for mental health and 
drug  treatment.    While  incarcerated[,]  defendant  to  have  anger 
management,  drug  and  mental  health  treatment,  job  training.  Upon 
release[,]  defendant  to  continue  mental  health  and  drug  treatment, 
random  urinalysis,  seek  and  maintain  employment,  stay  away  from 
both victims. . . . 

Mandamus Pet., Ex. 1 (emphasis added). 

 

 

On  March  23,  2022,  Mr.  Talbert  filed  a  Petition  for  Writ  of  Mandamus 

(Mandamus Petition) in this Court’s original jurisdiction, seeking to compel DOC to 

credit his sentence for time served and to either transfer him to SCI-Waymart for 

mental health treatment or release him on parole.2 

On  April  4,  2022,  Mr.  Talbert  filed  an  Application  for  Summary  Relief, 

asserting that he has a clear right to have DOC fully implement the sentence imposed 

by the Trial Court.  Specifically, Mr. Talbert seeks pre-sentence time credit “from 

the date of arrest, up until being released on bail (59 days), [a]nd from the date of 

his bail being revoked, up until his sentence (344 days).”   Mandamus Pet. ¶ 11.  Mr. 

Talbert  asks  this  Court  “to  fix  his  minimum  sentence  date to February  23,  2022, 

and[] . . . put him on the parole list.”   Talbert Appl. for Summ. Relief at 1.  Mr. 

Talbert  also  asks  this  Court  to  direct  DOC  to  provide  him  with  “the  anger 

 

2 A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy.  Taglienti v. Dep’t of Corr., 806 A.2d 
988, 991 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002).  “This Court may only issue a writ of mandamus where the petitioner 
possesses a clear legal right to enforce the performance of a ministerial act or mandatory duty, the 
[respondent] possesses a corresponding duty to perform the act, and the petitioner possesses no 
other adequate or appropriate remedy.”  Detar v. Beard, 898 A.2d 26, 29 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006).

management, drug, and mental health treatment” that the Trial Court “ordered [him] 

to receive while in DOC custody.”  Id.; see Mandamus Pet. ¶ 16(B).3   

 

On  August  3,  2022,  DOC  filed  a  Cross-Application  for  Summary  Relief, 

asserting that Mr. Talbert has failed to establish a clear right to mandamus relief.  

DOC asserts that the Trial Court did not direct DOC to apply the specific credit Mr. 

Talbert seeks.  DOC also asserts that although the Trial Court recommended that Mr. 

Talbert  be  housed  at  SCI-Waymart,  it  is  within  DOC’s  discretion  to  determine 

where, and under what conditions, to house Mr. Talbert.  According to DOC, the 

Pennsylvania Parole Board and DOC have exclusive “authority over the treatment 

conditions,  programming,  and  employment  aspects  of  [Mr.  Talbert’s]  sentence.”  

DOC Appl. for Summ. Relief ¶ 39. 

Analysis 

 

Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  1532(b)  provides  that  “[a]t  any 

time after the filing of a petition for review in an . . . original jurisdiction matter the 

court may on application enter judgment if the right of the applicant thereto is clear.”  

Pa.R.A.P.  1532(b).    “An  application  for  summary  relief  is  properly  evaluated 

according to the standards for summary judgment.”  Myers v. Com., 128 A.3d 846, 

849 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015).  In ruling on a motion for summary relief, we must view 

the  evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  non-moving  party  and  may  enter 

judgment only if:  (1) there are no genuine issues of material fact; and (2) the right 

to relief is clear as a matter of law.  Nw. Youth Servs., Inc. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 

1 A.3d 988, 990 n.1 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010).  “The record, for purposes of [a] motion 

for summary relief, is the same as [the] record for purposes of a motion for summary 

3 Mr. Talbert also previously filed an Application for Peremptory Relief and an Application 

for Preliminary Injunction, both of which this Court denied.

judgment.”  Summit Sch., Inc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 108 A.3d 192, 195 (Pa. Cmwlth. 

2015). 

 

 

DOC. 

First, Mr. Talbert asserts that he was entitled to credit for time served and it 

was DOC’s responsibility to figure out exactly how much time should be credited to 

his sentence.  In response, DOC asserts that it cannot sua sponte apply credit to Mr. 

Talbert’s sentence without clear direction from the sentencing court.  We agree with 

Here,  the  Trial  Court’s  sentencing  order  did  not  identify  specific  dates  of 

credit to be applied to Mr. Talbert’s sentence, nor did it unambiguously award him 

credit.    Rather,  the  sentencing  order  merely  stated:  “Credit  for  time  served  if 

applicable on this case.”  Mandamus Pet., Ex. 1 (emphasis added).  Our courts have 

consistently denied relief to a petitioner seeking a modification or recalculation of 

his sentence where the sentencing order was either silent as to credit or ambiguous 

in  stating  that  the  petitioner  should  receive  “credit  for  time  served.”    See,  e.g., 

McCray v. Dep’t of Corr., 872 A.2d 1127, 1133 (Pa. 2002) (holding that DOC had 

no duty to credit the petitioner’s sentence for time served because the sentencing 

order did not indicate that he was to receive credit for time served); Hoyt v. Dep’t of 

Corr.,  79  A.3d  741,  742  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  2013)  (sustaining  DOC’s  preliminary 

objections to a mandamus petition where the sentencing order was silent as to credit); 

Canfield v. Dep’t of Corr. (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 585 M.D. 2016, filed Aug. 11, 2017), 

slip op. at  2, 4 (sustaining DOC’s preliminary objections to  a mandamus petition 

where  the  sentencing  order  did  not  indicate  a  specific  number  of  days  for  which 

credit should be given, merely stating that the petitioner was to receive “credit for 

time served as allowed by law”); Mullen v. Dep’t of Corr. (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 328 

M.D.  2013,  filed  Jan.  30,  2014),  slip  op.  at  4-6  (sustaining  DOC’s  preliminary 

4 

objections  to  a  mandamus  petition  where  the  sentencing  order  did  “not  clearly 

require credit for the . . . period at issue”).4  In Canfield, this Court explained: 

 

andamus  is  an  appropriate  remedy  to  correct  an  error  in  DOC’s 
computation of maximum and minimum dates of confinement  where 
the sentencing order clearly gives the inmate credit for the time period 
in question and DOC’s computation does not comply with that credit.  
It cannot be used to challenge DOC’s failure to give credit where the 
sentencing order is either ambiguous or does not provide the credit at 
issue.    The  requirements  for  mandamus  cannot  be  satisfied  in  those 
circumstances because there is no clear right to relief and because the 
inmate  has  an  adequate  and  more  appropriate  alternative  remedy  of 
seeking modification or clarification of the sentence in the trial court. 

  M

Canfield, slip op. at 3-4 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted); see Terrell v. 

Facility Mgr. at SCI-Mahoney State Prison (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 95 M.D. 2020, filed 

Nov. 19, 2020), slip op. at 6 (“[M]andamus cannot be used to challenge the failure 

to award credit when the sentencing order is either ambiguous or does not provide 

the specific credit at issue.”) (emphasis added).  

 

We agree with DOC that the sentencing order in this case was ambiguous with 

regard  to  credit.    The  sentencing order  did  not specify  an  amount  of  credit  to  be 

applied, stating only that “credit for time served” would be given “if applicable.”  As 

explained  above,  mandamus  cannot  be  used  to  challenge  DOC’s  failure  to  apply 

credit where the sentencing order is ambiguous.  Therefore, we conclude that DOC 

4 Pursuant to this Court’s Internal Operating Procedures, unreported decisions of this Court, 
issued after January 15, 2008, may be cited for their persuasive value.  210 Pa. Code § 69.414(a). 

 Our courts have held that when a sentencing court does not give an inmate full credit for 
time served, the appropriate remedy is to seek modification or clarification from the sentencing 
court  or  through  the  direct  appeal  process,  not  through  a  mandamus  action  in  this  Court.    See 
McCray, 872 A.2d at 1133; Hoyt, 79 A.3d at 743; see also Mullen, slip op. at 5 (holding that where 
 

  5

has a clear right to relief on this issue.5 

 

5 

 

Second, Mr. Talbert asserts that DOC is obligated to provide him with mental 

health and drug treatment while he is in custody, rather than commit him to “the 

restrictive  housing  unit  where  his  mental  health  has,  and  continues  to,  contrarily 

deteriorate without the treatment.”  Talbert Reply Br. at 4.  Mr. Talbert avers that 

instead of providing him with the treatment recommended by the Trial Court, DOC 

“sent him to [a] maximum security prison[], in long[-]term restrictive housing, for 

behavior that resulted from his ‘untreated’ anger, drug, and mental health issues.”  

Mandamus Pet. ¶ 19.  Mr. Talbert further avers: 

 

 
[Mr. Talbert] has the following serious mental disorders: anxiety, [post-
traumatic  stress  disorder],  [attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder], 
bipolar,  paranoia  schizophrenia,  antisocial  personality  disorder,  and 
borderline  personality  disorder.    Instead  of  being  treated  for  these 
conditions, . . .  DOC has established and maintained a campaign of 
punishing [Mr. Talbert] with more and more isolated confinement for 
behavior directly related to the symptoms of his mental illness. 

Talbert Br. in Support of Appl. for Prelim. Inj. at 1-2 (emphasis added).  Mr. Talbert 

contends that by keeping him in “long[-]term isolated confinement alone,” DOC has 

“cause[d] him to suffer permanent psychological harm.”  Id. at 4; see also Talbert 

Answer to DOC New Matter ¶¶ 16, 19-20 (averring that “keeping [Mr. Talbert] in 

long-term isolated confinement” continues to aggravate “his pre[]existing physical 

and mental health issues”). 

 

However,  as  this  Court  previously  recognized,  since  the  filing  of  his 

Mandamus  Petition  and  Application  for  Summary  Relief,  Mr.  Talbert  has  been 

transferred  out  of  the  restrictive  housing  unit  at  SCI-Camp  Hill;  he  is  now 

permanently housed at SCI-Coal Township.  Talbert v. Dep’t of Corr. (Pa. Cmwlth., 

a sentencing order did not unambiguously require the credit the petitioner sought, his remedy was 
to seek modification or clarification of the sentence from the trial court). 

 

6 

No. 125 M.D. 2022, filed Oct. 18, 2022), slip op. at 2 (unpaginated).  Therefore, the 

adverse conditions Mr. Talbert allegedly suffered while in restrictive housing at SCI-

Camp Hill, which formed the basis of both his Mandamus Petition and Application 

for Summary Relief, no longer exist.  Id. 

 

Furthermore, while the sentencing court may make recommendations to DOC, 

DOC has the ultimate authority to determine where and under what conditions an 

inmate will be housed.  See 37 Pa. Code § 93.11(a) (“An inmate does not have a 

right to be housed in a particular facility or in a particular area within a facility.”); 

Lopez v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 119 A.3d 1081, 1085 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015) (“‘It is entirely 

a matter of [DOC’s] discretion where to house an inmate.’”) (citation omitted), aff’d, 

144 A.3d 92 (Pa. 2016);  Clark v. Beard, 918 A.2d 155, 161  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  2007) 

(“[J]udges may not indiscriminately denominate the place a prisoner is housed[.]”).  

Moreover, “[m]andamus does not lie to compel [DOC] employees to exercise their 

discretion  in  a  particular  way,  even  if  th[is]  Court  believes  it  has  been  exercised 

incorrectly.”    Clark,  918  A.2d  at  160-61.    Thus,  even  though  the  Trial  Court 

recommended  that  Mr.  Talbert  be  housed  at  SCI-Waymart  for  mental  health 

treatment, DOC was not bound by that recommendation.  Rather, DOC avers that, 

since Mr. Talbert has been in DOC’s custody, it “has provided [him] with reasonable 

and  appropriate  mental  health  care”  and  “has  recommended  reasonable  and 

appropriate  programming  for  [him].”    DOC  Appl.  for  Summ.  Relief  ¶¶  41-42.6  

There is nothing in the record to suggest that SCI-Coal Township, where Mr. Talbert 

is now confined, is incapable of providing the treatment he needs.  Therefore, we 

conclude that DOC has a clear right to relief on this issue. 

 

6 According to  DOC, “[Mr. Talbert] has an extensive misconduct  history of refusing  to 
obey orders and threatening [DOC] employees, sometimes with threats of physical harm, making 
it difficult for [DOC] employees to communicate with him.”  DOC Appl. for Summ. Relief ¶ 43. 

7 

Conclusion 

 

We conclude, based on our review of the record, that  (1) Mr. Talbert has not 

established a clear right to relief, and (2) DOC has established a clear right to relief.  

See Pa.R.A.P. 1532(b).  Accordingly, this Court denies Mr. Talbert’s Application 

for Summary Relief and grants DOC’s Cross-Application for Summary Relief.
