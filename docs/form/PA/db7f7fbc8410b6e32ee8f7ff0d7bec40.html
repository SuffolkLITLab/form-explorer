      <pre>JIM MARTIN

Jim Martin, Lehigh County District Attorney is the longest serving district attorney in the 
history of Lehigh County. He has been district attorney since January 1998 when he was 
appointed by the County Commissioners. He has been elected to six four-year terms in 
1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019.

Martin has 30 years’ experience as a prosecutor and more than 47 years’ experience as a 
trial attorney. He is past president (1986) of the Bar Association of Lehigh County.

From 2000-2012, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania 
District Attorneys Association and was president of the Association from2006-2007. He is a 
past president of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Institute, the educational and training 
arm of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association.

Martinis a past member (eight years) of the Governor’s Victims Services Advisory 
Committee of the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency and also had 
served on the Commission for Justice Initiatives, which was a Pennsylvania Bar Association 
and Pennsylvania Supreme Court joint commission which established templates for 
“Problem Solving” courts, including “Drug Courts.”

Martin manages a budget of over $13.4 million that includes about $5 million in grant 
money, forfeitures reimbursement and generated revenue. He supervises more than 125 
people – attorneys; administrative staff; a victim/witness unit; county detectives; homicide, 
drug and auto theft/insurance fraud task forces; the Regional Intelligence and Investigation 
Center (RIIC); the Officer David M. Petzold Digital Forensics Laboratory of Lehigh County 
located on the campus of DeSales University; and the Central Booking Unit.

Martin has spearheaded numerous innovations since becoming District Attorney:

•  The first Investigating Grand Jury in Lehigh County’s history was empaneled by Martin 
in 2001. Currently, the Tenth Investigating Grand Jury is hearing cases. A petition was 
recently filed with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to permit the Investigating Grand 
Jury to also act as an Indicting Grand Jury, and that has been granted.

•  The Child Advocacy Center (CAC) of Lehigh County was established in 2001, as a co-
located facility bringing law enforcement, Office of Children and Youth caseworkers, 
and health care professionals together in one place to provide victims of child abuse 
and sexual assault caring and professional services.

•	 The	Municipal	Emergency	Response	Team	(MERT)was	formed	by	Martin	in	

cooperation	with	Lehigh	County	Chiefs	of	Police	in	2001,and	it	continues	to	respond	to	
high-risk	situations	arising	in	the	county	and,	thereby,	enhances	public	safety.

•	 The	Bad	Check	Restitution	Program,	implemented	by	Martin	in	2005,	has	recovered	
more	than	$700,000	for	victims	of	bad	check	offenses	and	generated	over	$75,000	in	
revenue.

•	 The	Lehigh	County	Homicide	Task	Force,	formed	by	Martin	in	summer	2005,	has	

assisted	area	police	departments,	particularly	Allentown	Police	Department,	in	solving	
130	criminal	homicides	to	date,	resulting	in	the	arrest	of	141	dangerous	individuals.

•	 The	Officer	David	M.	Petzold	Digital	Forensics	Laboratory	of	Lehigh	County	was	
initiated	in	partnership	with	the	Officer	David	M.	Petzold	Memorial	Foundation,	
DeSales	University,	and	the	District	Attorney	to	provide	state-of-the-art	digital	forensic	
analyses.	The	Petzold	Foundation	to	date	has	contributed	over	$200,000	to	Lehigh	
County	for	the	use	of	the	District	Attorney	in	equipping	and	running	this	laboratory,	
and	it	represents	a	one-of-a-kind	county	laboratory	in	the	Commonwealth	aiding	
local	law	enforcement,	including	neighboring	Northampton	County.	The	lab	has	been	
instrumental	in	assisting	in	investigations	of	numerous	serious	crimes,	including	
homicides	and	child	pornography.

•	

In	January	2011	Martin	established	the	District	Attorney’s	Veterans’	Mentoring	Program,	
which	pairs	veterans	in	the	community	with	veterans	who	are	charged	with	non-violent	
crimes.	There	are	currently	25	veterans	who	have	volunteered	to	be	mentors	in	this	
program,	and	they	help	veterans	who	are	defendants	to	access	VA	benefits,	find	and	
apply	for	jobs,	obtain	housing,	stay	drug	and	alcohol	free,	and	once	again	become	
productive	members	of	society.	

•	 The	Elder	Abuse	Task	Force,	formed	by	Martin	in	2007,	continues	to	increase	public	
awareness	of	elder	abuse	and	neglect	and	assists	in	performing	investigations	of	
crimes	against	the	elderly.

•	 The	Lehigh	County	Central	Booking	Center,	established	by	Martin	in	2007,	continues	
to	save	police	departments	throughout	the	county	thousands	of	officer’s	hours	in	the	
processing	of	individuals	arrested	for	crimes	within	the	county.	This	center’s	operating	
expenses	are	completely	covered	by	charges	assessed	against	convicted	defendants	
processed	through	the	center.	The	center	has	consistently	shown	a	profit”	of	revenue	
over	expenses	from	its	inception	and	utilizes	no	tax	dollars.

•	

In	2012/2013	Martin	established	the	Lehigh	County	Firearm	and	Tool	Mark	Laboratory	
to	provide	Lehigh	County	law	enforcement	agencies	with	expert	ballistics	examinations	
on	an	accelerated	basis.	This	modern	lab	is	centrally	located	within	the	Cetronia	
Ambulance	Corps/Lehigh	County	Building	in	South	Whitehall	Township.

•	 Martin	leads	the	development	of	the	Lehigh	County	Regional	Intelligence	and	

Investigation	Center	(RIIC),	which	began	operations	in	2013.	This	center	integrates	
data	from	all	police	departments	in	the	county	and	recently	included	data	from	
Northampton	County	departments.	It	also	includes	dozens	of	local,	state	and	federal	
databases	in	one	electronic	crime-fighting	resource,	which	has	assisted	in	the	
investigation	of	numerous	crimes	and	has	dramatically	enhanced	the	ability	of	criminal	
investigators	to	solve	crimes.	Martin	was	successful	in	obtaining	a	$150,000	matching	
grant	from	the	Harry	C.	Trexler	Trust	and	several	grants	totaling	$500,000	from	the	
Pennsylvania	Commission	on	Crime	and	Delinquency	(PCCD)	to	enlarge	the	data	
sources	integrated	into	the	system	and	to	enhance	the	gang	intelligence	database	for	
use	by	local	law	enforcement.	Currently	the	RIIC	is	partnering	with	Homeland	Security	
Investigations	(HSI)	in	Washington,	D.C.,	which	is	using	its	Gang	Intelligence	System	as	
a	“pilot”	for	tracking	transnational	gangs.	This	has	resulted	in	the	recent	award	of	a	$1.1	
million	grant	to	the	RIIC.

•	 Martin	and	the	RIIC	are	partnering	with	area	healthcare	providers,	Lehigh	Valley	

Health	Network	and	St.	Luke’s	University	Health	Network,	to	analyze	mental	health	
related	data	from	a	law	enforcement	and	healthcare	perspective.	Both	sectors	are	often	
dealing	with	the	same	population.	Once	an	individual	is	arrested	and	in	the	system,	
it	is	more	costly	and	difficult	to	treat	that	person.	By	partnering	with	healthcare	in	a	
collaborative	effort,	steps	can	be	taken	toward	a	proactive	approach	to	work	toward	
getting	such	individuals	the	mental	health	treatment	that	they	need.	

•	 Martin	also	obtained	a	grant	to	assist	in	the	placement	of	medication	collection	boxes	
at	12	police	departments	throughout	the	county	and	at	Lehigh	Valley	Hospital	sites	
at	Cedar	Crest	in	Salisbury	Township,	17th	and	Chew	Streets	in	Allentown,	and	the	
Muhlenberg	Campus	in	Bethlehem.	These	collection	boxes	are	available	to	the	public	
for	discarding	and	collecting	unused	prescription	and	over-the-counter	medications,	
thereby	reducing	the	potential	for	abuse	of	narcotics.	In	addition,	Martin’s	office	has	
assisted	in	the	coordination	of	the	Drug	Enforcement	Administration	(DEA)	National	
Take	Back	Days	for	the	collection	of	unused	medications.	To	date	these	program	shave	
resulted	in	the	collection	and	proper	disposal	of	more	than	20	tons	of	unwanted	and	
potentially	dangerous	and	abused	prescription	medications.

•	

In	2014,	Martin	revamped	the	Domestic	Violence	Unit	of	the	District	Attorney’s	Office	
and,	with	the	assistance	of	the	Court	of	Common	Pleas,	established	a	Domestic	
Violence	Court	through	which	all	domestic	violence	cases	are	now	prosecuted.	In	
concert	with	Martin’s	initiative,	the	Lehigh	County	Adult	Probation	Office	has	initiated	
a	Batterers	Intervention	Education	Program	for	defendants	convicted	of	domestic	
violence.	This	results	in	these	defendants	being	more	closely	supervised	and	treated	
for	anger	management	issues.

•	 Martin	has	played	a	leading	role	in	the	establishment	of	“Team	MISA”	which	deals	with	
defendants	who	have	mental	health	and/or	substance	abuse	problems.	Team	MISA	is	
comprised	of	the	various	stakeholders	in	Lehigh	County	and	in	the	justice	system.	It	is	
chaired	by	the	First	Assistant	District	Attorney.	

•	 Martin	led	the	distribution	of	Narcan/naloxone,	the	drug	which	reverses	an	opioid	

overdose,	to	all	Lehigh	County	Police	Departments	in	2014.	In	2018,	Martin	helped	to	
establish	the	Blue	Guardian	Program,	together	with	Lehigh	County	Drug	and	Alcohol
