PHASE 2 OPERATIONS 

TRANSITION 

As the Court begins to transition to what may be the “new normal” in operations 
and interaction with the public, We are mindful of our unwavering priority and goal of the 
health and safety of our employees and the public which has guided us throughout this 
pandemic. 

 In accordance with the extension of the judicial emergency through and including 
May 31, 2020 ordered after consultation with state, regional and local medical experts, 
review of the CDC and Pennsylvania Department of Health guidelines, and in compliance 
with the spirit of Governor Wolf and the Secretary of Health’s orders, We promulgate the 
following procedures for the 43rd Judicial District effective immediately*: 

 

A. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

1.  All persons entering any Court facility shall wear face coverings in accordance with 
this  Court’s  Emergency  Administrative  Order  No.  76  and  shall  comply  with  all 
requirements therein including, but not limited to, maintaining physical distancing 
of at least 6 feet at all times.  

2.  Courthouse boxes and forms will remain at the front door and the Sheriff’s staff will 
continue to act as the “gatekeeper” in accordance with the emergency orders and 
these procedures. 

3.  Litigants will only be permitted in the facility 10 minutes or less prior to a scheduled 
proceeding and counsel shall speak with their clients outside of the court facility 
prior to the proceeding. Witnesses will remain outside of the court facility and will 
be called in as needed. Reasonable accommodations for the press and for public 
access to proceedings will be made upon request to Court Administration. 

4.  ACT will continue to be used at all times when possible and practicable.  In person 
appearances  will  continue  to  be  limited  to  the  matters  currently  being  heard 
pursuant to the emergency orders or as ordered by the Presiding Judge. 

5.  Unless otherwise directed by a specific Order of Court, documents/exhibits for use 
in all types of proceedings must be emailed to the presiding Judge/Master/Hearing 
Officer  or  Conciliator  to  an  address  provided  by  the  Presiding  Judge  or  Court 

*Please not that these procedures may be modified on a regular basis as the safety parameters and 
pandemic evolve. Not all processes will be ready for implementation on May 1st and will be on a rolling 
basis as noted specifically herein.

more “down time” in court, it remains necessary for the health of the public, counsel 
and employees.
