Appellant 

 No. 2337 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Order Entered August 23, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County Criminal Division at No(s):  
CP-52-CR-0000350-2017 

EFORE:  BOWES, J., McCAFFERY, J., and SULLIVAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY BOWES, J.: 

 

 

      FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

Michael Paul Kin appeals from the order that denied his petition seeking 

to  have  the  transportation  costs  for  his  Post  Conviction  Relief  Act  (“PCRA”) 

proceedings explained, reduced, or vacated entirely.  We affirm. 

In  2018,  Appellant  pled  guilty  to  crimes  related  to  sexual  abuse  of  a 

child and was sentenced to ten to twenty years of imprisonment plus fines, 

costs, and restitution.  Appellant paid the monetary portion of his sentence in 

full  that  year.    Appellant  did  not  file  a  direct  appeal,  but  filed  a  timely, 

counseled PCRA petition.   

An  evidentiary  hearing  on  the  PCRA  petition  was  scheduled  for 

December  20,  2019.    The  trial  court  entered  an  order  for  Appellant  to  be 

released  from  the  State  Correctional  Institution  at  (“SCI-Fayette”)  into  the 

custody of the Pike County Sheriff’s Department to be transported to the Pike

County Courthouse  for the hearing, to  be housed at the Pike County jail as 

necessary, and to be returned as soon as practicable after the hearing.  See 

Order, 11/5/22.  Accordingly, Appellant appeared at the December 20 hearing, 

where his witness offered some testimony in support of his claim, but counsel 

requested a continuance in order to obtain additional documents.   See N.T. 

PCRA  Hearing,  12/20/19,  at  17.    The  PCRA  court  granted  the  request  and 

continued the hearing until January 10, 2020.  The court further indicated that 

Appellant was to  

be  returned  by  the  Pike  County  Sheriff’s  Office  .  .  .  to  SCI–
Waymart, and then where he is placed within the state system[, 
Appellant’s counsel,] you could determine that, but the Sheriff’s 
Office has indicated that it will make sure he will be transported 
from  wherever  he  may  be  back  for  that  hearing  so  we  can 
conclude the hearing record on that day. 
 

Id. at 18 (cleaned up).   

 

On  January  10,  2020,  Appellant  presented  the  remaining  evidence  in 

support of his PCRA claims.  The PCRA court took the matter under advisement 

at the conclusion of the proceeding and ultimately entered an order denying 

the  petition.    On  appeal,  this  Court  affirmed  the  PCRA  court’s  ruling.    See 

Commonwealth  v.  Kin,  256  A.3d  14  (Pa.Super.  2021)  (non-precedential 

decision).   

 

At  a  time  or  times  not  apparent  from  the  docket  or  certified  record 

before  us,  the  clerk  of  courts,  in  accordance  with  42  Pa.C.S.  § 9728(g), 

assessed Appellant $2,875.80 for the costs of transporting him to and from 

the  PCRA  hearings.    On  August  3,  2022,  Appellant  filed  a  pro  se  motion  to 

- 2 - 

have the costs vacated, complaining that the negligence of his PCRA counsel 

was “to blame for the obsured [sic] costs.”  Motion, 8/3/22, at unnumbered 

1.  The court promptly denied the motion on procedural bases.  See Order, 

On  August  17,  2022,  Appellant  filed  a  new  petition  to  have  the  costs 

vacated,  complaining  that  the  markedly  dissimilar  amounts  for  transporting 

him the same distance was unreasonable, that they were not all legitimately 

assessed to him because some were beyond his control as being the result of 

the lack of readiness of “the [c]ourt and the [c]ourt’s officers,” and that those 

costs were not “costs of prosecution” within the meaning of § 9728(g).  See 

Petition,  8/17/22,  at  ¶¶  4-9.    Appellant  requested  “one  or  more”  of  the 

a)    That  the  cost  of  transportation  in  the  total  amount  of 

$2875.80 be dismissed without payment. 

That a detailed itemized statement of the amount owed to 
the Sheriff’s Department for transportation be ordered to be 
presented to [Appellant] and the court. 

That the cost of transportation by the Pike County Sheriff’s 
Office be readjusted to a lower amount that meets the cost 
of  actual  transportation  that  falls  within  the  range  of  the 
other 66 counties in the Commonwealth.

Id. at unnumbered 3 (unnecessary capitalization omitted).   

 

The trial court denied Appellant’s petition by order of August 23, 2022.  

Therein, the court specified that the authority upon which Appellant relied to 

support his claim that transportation costs were not costs of prosecution was

no longer good law.  See Order, 8/23/22 (citing Commonwealth v. Morales-

Rivera, 67 A.3d 1290, 1294 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2013) (holding that transportation 

costs for a PCRA hearing are authorized by § 9728(g)).  However, in denying 

the petition, the trial court did not address Appellant’s alternative requests for 

an  itemized  statement  of  the  costs  of  transportation  or  an  adjustment  to 

 

 This  timely  appeal  followed.1    Appellant  presents  this  Court  with  the 

reflect actual costs. 

following question: 

1 By order of September 12, 2022, the trial court directed Appellant to file a 
Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, but, 
although  Appellant  asserted  in  this  Court  that  he  timely  complied  with  the 
order, no statement from Appellant was docketed or included in the certified 
record.  The trial court suggests that Appellant’s issues are therefore waived.  
See Trial Court Opinion, 11/2/22, at 3.   

his Court will not find waiver pursuant to Rule 1925(b)(4)(vii) unless the trial 
court’s Rule 1925(b) order complied strictly with the requirements of Pa.R.A.P. 
1925(b)(3).  See, e.g., Rahn v. Consol. Rail Corp., 254 A.3d 738, 745-46 
(Pa.Super. 2021); Boyle v. Main Line Health, Inc., 272 A.3d 466 (Pa.Super. 
2022) (non-precedential decision at 11 n.8) (“It would be fundamentally unfair 
to require appellants to strictly comply with the requirements of Rule 1925, 
but  not  require  the  same  diligence  from  the  trial  court  requesting  a  Rule 
1925(b) statement.”).   

ur review of the certified record reveals that the trial court’s order failed to 
specify  “that  the  Statement  shall  be  served  on  the  judge  pursuant  to 
paragraph (b)(1) and both the place the appellant can serve the Statement in 
person  and  the  address  to  which  the  appellant  can  mail  the  Statement.”  
Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(3)(iii).  Therefore, rather than remand for a determination 
of  whether  Appellant  timely  submitted  a  Rule  1925(b)  statement  to  prison 
authorities for mailing, we proceed to the questions raised on appeal.   See 
Pa.R.A.P.  1925(c)(1)  (“An  appellate  court  may  remand  in  either  a  civil  or 
criminal case for a determination as to whether a Statement had been filed

J-S03005-23 

Was the court in error for its denial of the Appellant’s  [petition] 
when it failed to address the issue[s] raised that the cost of the 
Sheriff’s Department charged to the Appellant for transportation 
to and from court kept changing and were not consistent and that 
the  court  failed  to  request  an  itemized  statement  from  the 
Sheriff’s Department along with a reasoning for the ever changing 
cost of transportation? 
 

Appellant’s brief at 4 (some punctuation altered).   

 

Before we consider the substance of Appellant’s appeal, we must first 

determine  whether  we  have  jurisdiction  to  do  so.    Appellant  identified  the 

petition sub judice as one pursuant to the PCRA.  See Appellant’s brief at 3-

4.  The trial court construed it as one for a writ of mandamus.  See Trial Court 

Opinion, 11/2/22, at 3.  The question Appellant presents, namely the amount 

of costs assessed as a result of his conviction, is one that has in other cases 

been litigated as a challenge to the initial imposition of a judgment of sentence 

or through filing for a writ of mandamus seeking a refund of costs deducted 

from an inmate account.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Williams, 909 A.2d 

419,  420  (Pa.Cmwlth.  2006)  (appealing  denial  of  petition  for  writ  of 

mandamus seeking the return of transportation costs);  Commonwealth v. 

Gill,  432  A.2d  1001,  1003  (Pa.Super.  1981)  (reviewing  challenge  to  the 

amount of costs on direct appeal from the judgment of sentence).   

____________________________________________ 

and/or  served  or  timely  filed  and/or  served.”);  Commonwealth  v. 
DiClaudio,  210  A.3d  1070,  1074  (Pa.Super.  2019)  (“The  prisoner  mailbox 
rule provides that a pro se prisoner’s document is deemed filed on the date 
he delivers it to prison authorities for mailing.” (cleaned up)).   

- 5 - 

J-S03005-23 

In  this  appeal,  however,  Appellant  is  not  seeking  mandamus  relief  or 

challenging the legality of his judgment of sentence through the PCRA.  See 

Appellant’s  brief  at  7  (indicating  expressly  that  Appellant  is  not  challenging 

the collection of costs by the Department of Corrections or arguing that he is 

not required  to  pay reasonable costs for transportation).    Rather,  Appellant 

asked the trial court to modify the amount of costs of prosecution assessed 

after his judgment of sentence had become final upon the belief that the costs 

were unreasonable.  In this context, where costs are added after the original 

sentence, we have viewed the imposition of costs not as a separate penalty 

to the defendant, but rather a statutorily-mandated incident of the underlying 

judgment.  See Commonwealth v. Bollinger, 418 A.2d 320, 327 (Pa.Super. 

1979); Commonwealth v. Denson, 40 A.2d 895, 896 (Pa.Super. 1945).  It 

is further settled that “[n]on-punitive, administrative requirements [that] are 

merely collateral consequences of a criminal conviction” do “not fall within the 

purview  of  the  PCRA.”    Commonwealth  v.  Smith,  240  A.3d  654,  658 

(Pa.Super.  2020).    Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  we  have  jurisdiction  to 

consider  the  merits  of  Appellant’s  claims  without  considering  the  time-

limitations of the PCRA.2   

____________________________________________ 

2 See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b) (providing all PCRA petitions must be filed within 
one year of the judgment of sentence becoming final or establish a statutory 
exception).

J-S03005-23 

We thus turn to the substance of this appeal, beginning with a review of 

the  applicable  legal  principles.    “The  District  Attorney  must  provide  a 

defendant, who is charged with costs, a reasonably specific bill of costs and 

show how such costs were necessary to the prosecution.”  Commonwealth 

v. Coder, 415 A.2d 406, 410 (Pa. 1980).  “Costs must not be assessed except 

as authorized by law, and the Commonwealth bears the burden of justifying 

such costs by the preponderance of evidence.”  Commonwealth v. Williams, 

909 A.2d 419, 420–21 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2006).   

 

Our legislature has authorized the assessment of costs in criminal cases 

as follows: 

limited 

to,  any 

including,  but  not 

Any  sheriff’s costs,  filing fees and costs of  the county  probation 
department,  clerk  of  courts  or  other  appropriate  governmental 
agency, 
reasonable 
administrative costs associated with the collection of restitution, 
transportation  costs  and  other  costs  associated  with  the 
prosecution, shall be borne by the defendant and shall be collected 
by  the  county  probation  department  or  other  appropriate 
governmental agency along with the total amount of the judgment 
and remitted to the appropriate agencies at the time of or prior to 
satisfaction of judgment. 
 

42 Pa.C.S. § 9728(g).  These “costs associated with the prosecution” include 

post-conviction  costs  such  as  transportation  for  PCRA  hearings.    See 

Morales-Rivera, supra at 1294. 

 

The trial court opined that, because § 9728(g) expressly permitted the 

assessment  of  the  sheriff’s  transportation  costs,  the  court  properly  denied 

Appellant’s  petition.    See  Trial  Court  Opinion,  11/2/22,  at  4-5.    Appellant 

concedes that the trial court correctly ruled that Appellant was responsible for 

- 7 - 

the transportation costs associated with his PCRA proceeding.  See Appellant’s 

brief at 6 (“[U]nder [the prevailing law,” the[ trial court’s] argument is correct.  

This argument is not being raised here”).   

 

However,  Appellant  notes  that  he  also  challenged  in  his  petition  “the 

multiple amounts of inconsistent charges for transportation to and from court 

by  the  Pike  County  Sheriff's  Department  forced  upon  the  Appellant.”    Id.  

Specifically,  Appellant  asserts  that  the  three  trips  produced  the  following 

inexplicably-inconsistent costs: 

a) 

Transported  from  SCI  Fayette  (Fayette  County)  to  SCI 
Waymart (Pike County) by transport bus with other inmates. 

Fayette County to Pike County: $ 168.26 
Pike County to Fayette County: $  60.34 

)   SCI Fayette (Fayette County) to SCI Waymart (Pike County) 

by Sheriff's Car, Hearing was postponed). 

Fayette County to Pike County: $  253.58 
Pike County to Fayette County: $ 1,222.43 
 

c)   SCI Fayette (Fayette County) to SCI Waymart (Pike County) 
 

Fayette County to Pike County: $ 1,031.14 
Pike County to Fayette County: $   140.05  

 

Id.  Given these disparate amounts for the same route, Appellant argues “that 

the charges for transportation by the Pike County Sheriff's Department [are] 

not  reasonable,  not  equal  and  way  overboard,  and  do  not  meet  the 

reasonableness of § 9728(g).”  Id. at 7.   

 

The  trial  court  opinion  does  not  acknowledge  or  address  Appellant’s 

challenge to the amount of the costs imposed or lack of explanation therefor.

J-S03005-23 

Likewise,  the  Commonwealth  ignores  the  arguments  Appellant  raises  on 

appeal  in  favor  of  the  issue  that  Appellant  expressly  has  abandoned.    See 

Commonwealth’s  brief  at  3-4.    Consequently,  we  are  left  without  an 

explanation from the trial court to support a conclusion that Appellant received 

the reasonably itemized statement of assessable costs.   

However, we need not remand for the trial court to take further action 

because we are able to discern the lack of merit of Appellant’s claims from the 

record  before  us.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Smith,  17  A.3d  873,  884  (Pa. 

2011) (“Where a petitioner has presented a claim to [a lower] court and that 

court has not addressed it, a remand is appropriate where the claim cannot 

be resolved on the record.  Where, however, we may resolve the claim on the 

record, we will proceed to decide it.”).  As our following discussion details, it 

is plain from the certified record that Appellant’s arguments misstate the of-

record  itemization  of  the  costs  incurred  by  the  Sheriff’s  Office  delineated  in 

the inmate transfer cost forms filed by the Pike County Sheriff’s Office.   

For the first hearing on December 20, 2019, Appellant apparently was 

assessed  no  costs  for  the  multi-inmate  bus  ride  from  SCI-Fayette  to  SCI-

Waymart.  He was assessed $168.26 for transportation from SCI-Waymart to 

the Pike County Jail on December 18, 2019, which included of three hours of 

pay for two deputies at $19.73 per hour per deputy, and $0.58 per mile for a 

total  of  eighty-six  miles.    See  Inmate  Transfer  Cost  Form,  12/20/19.  

Appellant  also  was  assessed  $60.34  for  the  two  hours,  one  of  which  was 

- 9 - 

J-S03005-23 

overtime for each, it took two deputies on December 20, 2019, to take him 

the thirty-six miles from the Pike County Jail to the hearing, and then $253.58 

for  two  deputies  to  take  him  the  ninety-seven  miles  from  the  Pike  County 

Courthouse back to SCI-Waymart.  See Inmate Transfer Cost Forms, 1/15/20 

(docket entries 47 and 48).  It appears that Appellant was then not charged 

with any costs for the transport from SCI-Waymart to SCI-Fayette. 

 

On  January  8  and  9,  2020,  two  deputies  drove  from  Pike  County  to 

Fayette County, spent $104.34 on lodging and $79.42 on meals, and drove 

Appellant  from  SCI-Fayette  to  the  Pike  County  Jail,  logging  777  miles  at 

$0.575 per mile and fifteen hours for each deputy, still at $19.73 per hour, 

for  a  grand  total  of  $1,222.43.    See  Inmate  Transfer  Cost  Form,  1/17/20 

(docket entry 51).  On the day of the hearing, two deputies spent a total time 

of two and one-half hours on the seventy-two-mile round trip from the jail to 

the courthouse for a total cost of $140.05.  See Inmate Transfer Cost Form, 

1/17/20 (docket entry 49).   

 

Finally, after the hearing, two deputies were on the clock for a total of 

twelve  hours  for  driving  Appellant  from  the  Pike  County  Jail  back  to  SCI-

Fayette on January 14, 2020, spending $106.56 and $38.59, respectively on 

lodging and meals, then returning the following day to Pike County, a round 

trip of 762 miles.  See Inmate Transfer Cost Form, 1/17/20 (docket entry 50).   

The  total  assessment  for  these  costs,  charged  at  the  same  rates  as  the 

January 8-9, 2020 trip, was $1,031.14.  Id.   

- 10 - 

J-S03005-23 

 

Hence, the record in this case available to Appellant contains a detailed 

explanation  for  the  $2,875.80  that  he  was  assessed  for  the  transportation 

costs necessitated by his PCRA hearings, costs that he concedes are taxable 

to him pursuant to § 9728(g).  Further, the stark contrast in costs between 

the  first  hearing  and  the  second  one  plainly  resulted  from  the  fact  that  the 

Pike County Sheriff’s Office did not have to transport him from Fayette County 

to Pike County, or return him to Fayette County, for the first PCRA hearing.  

Finally,  we  discern  nothing  “overboard”  about  the  amount  of  the  costs 

assessed.    Accord  Morales-Rivera,  supra  at  1294  (affirming  denial  of 

challenge  to  $4,353.91  for  transportation  costs  in  connection  with  PCRA 

hearing). 

 

Therefore, because Appellant has not demonstrated that he was denied 

a properly itemized bill of the transportation costs or that the costs were not 

necessary,  we  have  no  cause  to  disturb  the  trial  court’s  order  denying  his 

- 11 - 

petition.   

Order affirmed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
