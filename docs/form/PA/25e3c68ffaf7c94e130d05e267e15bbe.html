NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

ESTATE OF V.E.R, DECEASED 
 
 
APPEAL OF:  T.J.R. 

 

 

 

 

 No. 1515 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Order Entered May 24, 2022 
in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County Orphans’ Court 
at No(s):  2007-E0088 

EFORE:   KING, J., SULLIVAN, J., and STEVENS, P.J.E.* 

MEMORANDUM BY STEVENS, P.J.E.: 
 

 

      FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

Appellant, Thomas J. Romano, appeals pro se from the orphans’ court’s 

May 24, 2022 order denying the petition to remove John J. Gonzales, Esq. as 

administrator of Decedent’s estate.  After careful review, we affirm.1 

The relevant facts and procedural history of this case, as gleaned from 

the certified record, are as follows:  On April 17, 2004, Dr. Vincent E. Romano 

(hereinafter,  “Decedent”)  executed  a  deed  which  transferred  his  interest  to 

his home at 256 Radcliffe Street, Bristol, Pennsylvania (the “property”) to his 

daughter,  Mary  Jo  D’Agostino  and  her  husband,  Peter  D’Agostino,  while 

____________________________________________ 

* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court. 

 Appellees, Bernadette Snearowski and Mary Jo D’Agostino, filed a letter on 
October 3, 2022 indicating that they will not be filing an appellate brief in this 
matter.

J-A03009-23 

reserving  a  life  estate  for  himself.    In  2007,  Appellant,  Decedent’s  son, 

initiated  guardianship  proceedings  regarding  Decedent.    After  various 

petitions and several hearings, the orphan’s court entered a decree on June 

12,  2007,  which  declared  Decedent  to  be  an  incapacitated  person  and 

appointed Deborah L. Klock as plenary guardian of his person and estate. 

On  May  5,  2010,  Decedent  died  testate,  domiciled  in  Bucks  County, 

Pennsylvania.  He was survived by nine of his children.  On or about the date 

of Decedent’s death, Appellant filed an informal caveat with the Bucks County 

Register of Wills, contending that Decedent executed a codicil to his February 

9, 2001 will on January 30, 2007.  The codicil nominated Appellant to serve 

as executor.  Michael Romano, another son of Decedent, also filed a “Petition 

for Grant of Letters Testamentary” with the Register of Wills on May 5, 2010.  

The  will  that  Michael  Romano  offered  for  probate  was  dated  June  15,  1998 

and  nominated  Michael  Romano  to  serve  as  executor.    On  May  19,  2010, 

Appellant filed a “Petition for Grant of Letters Testamentary” with the Register 

of Wills, which offered for probate Decedent’s February 9, 2001 will and the 

January 30, 2007 codicil. 

The Register of Wills scheduled a hearing for August 31, 2010 to resolve 

the controversy.  By agreement of the parties, the Register of Wills admitted 

to  probate  Decedent’s  February  9,  2001  will  and  appointed  John  Gonzales, 

Esq., as a neutral administrator of Decedent’s estate.  Over the intervening 

years since this resolution, Decedent’s Estate and the guardianship have been 

- 2 - 

J-A03009-23 

the subject of extensive litigation, which has included objections to the estate 

accounting  filed  by  the  Administrator  Gonzales  and  objections  to  the 

guardianship accounting of Deborah Klock.  

No  party  moved  for  a  hearing  on  the  objections,  and  as  a  result,  the 

orphans’  court  sua  sponte  scheduled  a  final  hearing  on  the  objections  on 

March  17,  2020.    This  hearing  was  ultimately  continued  as  a  result  of  the 

Covid-19 pandemic, and on February 22, 2021, the orphans’ court issued case 

management order that denied all pending pre-trial motions and set an April 

2, 2021 deadline for the filing of additional pre-trial motions.  The February 

22, 2021 order also set a May 1, 2021 deadline to exchange expert reports; 

identified  and  limited  the  issues  for  trial;  and  permitted  all  pre-trial  rulings 

and questions about the scope of hearing to be preserved for appellate review. 

On March 18, 2022, Administrator Gonzales filed a “Petition to Remove 

Administrator  cta  by  Consent.”    On  May  18,  2022,  a  hearing  was  held 

regarding this matter.  Thereafter, on May 24, 2022, the orphans’ court issued 

an order denying Administrator Gonzales’ petition.   

In its May 24, 2022 order, the orphans’ court explained that its decision 

was based on the fact that Administrator Gonzales did not allege a medical 

emergency or condition that warranted immediate action.  The orphans’ court 

further explained that it intended to schedule a hearing on the merits of the 

outstanding objections no later than October 2022.  See orphans’ court order, 

5/24/22 at n.1.

5, 2022.   

On June 14, 2022, Appellant filed a timely pro se appeal from the May 

24, 2022 order.  On June 16, 2022, the orphans’ court ordered Appellant to 

file a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, in accordance with 

Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).  Appellant filed a lengthy Rule 1925(b) statement on July 

On September 14, 2022, the orphans’ court filed a Rule 1925(a) opinion.  

Therein,  the  orphan’s  court  found  that  Appellant’s  Rule  1925(b)  statement 

failed  to  comply  with  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  in 

numerous  respects.    See  orphans’  court  opinion,  9/14/22  at  5-6.    The 

orphans’  court  concluded  that  Appellant’s  Rule  1925(b)  statement  “is  so 

disorganized and difficult to decipher” that it is the functional equivalent of no 

concise  statement  at  all.    Id.  at  6.    The  orphans’  court  further  noted  that 

Appellant’s  Rule  1925(b)  statement  “is  far  from  concise,”  but  rather  is  a 

conglomeration  of  various  allegations  intertwined  with  lengthy  passages  of 

case law, statutes, Orphan’s Court Rules, and notes of testimony.  Id. at 3, 

6.  Alternatively, the orphans’ court found that even if Appellant’s issues on 

appeal  are  not  waived  due  to  his  insufficient  Rule  1925(b)  statement,  his 

appeal  should  still  be  dismissed  because  the  removal  of  an  estate  fiduciary 

was within its discretion.  Id. at 6-9. 

On  September  27,  2022,  Appellees  filed  an  “Application  to  Quash” 

Appellant’s  appeal  that  was  ultimately  denied  by  this  Court  on  October  31, 

2022. 

- 4 - 

J-A03009-23 

Prior to any consideration of the merits of Appellant’s appeal, we must 

first  determine  whether  his  brief  complies  with  the  Pennsylvania  Rule  of 

Appellate Procedure.   

It is well settled that parties to an appeal are required to submit briefs 

in conformity, in all material respects, with the requirements of the Rules of 

Appellate Procedure, as nearly as the circumstances of the particular case will 

admit.  Pa.R.A.P. 2101.  “This Court may quash or dismiss an appeal if the 

appellant fails to conform to the requirements set forth in the  Pennsylvania 

Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure.”    In  re  Ullman,  995  A.2d  1207,  1211 

(Pa.Super. 2010) (citation omitted), appeal denied, 20 A.3d 489 (Pa. 2011).   

We  will  not  advocate  or  act  as  counsel  for  an  appellant  who  has  not 

substantially complied with our rules.  Bombar v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 932 A.2d 

78, 93 (Pa.Super. 2007) (citation omitted).  Moreover, Appellant’s status as a 

pro se litigant does not absolve him from responsibility for compliance with 

the rules.  See Commonwealth v. Adams, 882 A.2d 496, 498 (Pa.Super. 

2005)  (stating,  “any  person  choosing  to  represent  himself  in  a  legal 

proceeding must . . . assume that his lack of expertise and legal training will 

be his undoing.”). 

Here,  our  review  reveals  that  Appellant’s  brief  falls  well  below  the 

standards delineated in our Rules of  Appellate Procedure.  Preliminarily, we 

observe that Appellant’s brief does not contain a statement of jurisdiction; a 

separate section specifying the order or determination sought to be reviewed; 

- 5 - 

J-A03009-23 

a  statement  of  the  scope  and  standard  of  review;  nor  a  short  conclusion 

stating the precise relief sought.  See Pa.R.A.P. 2111(a)(1), (2), (3), and (9).   

Additionally, the “Argument” portion of Appellant’s brief is not “divided 

into  as  many  parts  as  there  are  questions  to  be  argued[,]”  as  this  section 

contains  no  distinctive  subheadings  at  all.    See  Pa.R.A.P.  2111(a)(8)  and 

2119(a).  On the contrary, Appellant’s “Argument” is confusing and presents 

vague,  largely  conclusory  allegations  of  error  intertwined  with  lengthy 

passages of case law and notes of testimony.  See Appellant’s brief at 20-41.2  

Appellant fails  to conduct a  meaningful discussion and analysis of this legal 

authority  and  how  it  is  applicable  to  his  case,  in  direct  violation  of  Rule 

2119(a).    See  Pa.R.A.P.  2119(a)  (stating  that  the  argument  shall  include 

“such discussion and citation of authorities as are deemed pertinent.”).   

Although Appellant’s brief does include a statement of the case, entitled 

“Facts”,  it  is  largely  devoid  of  the  necessary  citations  or  references  to  the 

record in violation of Rules 2119(b) and (c) and is interwoven with multiple 

allegations  that  are  not  relevant  to  the  factual  or  procedural  history  of  this 

case.  See Appellant’s brief at 8-18.  

Most  significantly,  as  discussed,  Appellant  has  failed  to  include  a 

“Statement  of  Questions  Involved”  in  his  brief  in  direct  violation  of  Rule 

2116(a),  which  provides  that  the  statement  of  the  questions  involved  must

our discussion, we have assigned each page a corresponding number.

J-A03009-23 

state the issues “with sufficient specificity to enable the reviewing court to 

readily identify the issues to be resolved….”  Pa.R.A.P. 2116(a) note (emphasis 

added).  Appellant’s failure to include a statement of the questions involved is 

particularly troubling as this requirement defines the specific issues this court 

is being asked to review.  See e.g., Smathers v. Smathers, 670 A.2d 1159, 

1160 (Pa.Super. 1996). 

Given  the  substantial  defects  in  Appellant’s  brief,  we  could  quash  his 

appeal  for  failure  to  comply  with  our  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure.    In  re 

Ullman,  995  A.2d  at  1211.    However,  in  light  of  the  fact  that  this  case 

proceeded to oral argument, we will briefly address the merits of Appellant’s 

cognizable issue on appeal.   

As  best  we  can  discern  from  his  woefully  defective  brief,  the  crux  of 

Appellant’s  claim  is  that  the  orphans’  court  did  not  remove  Gonzales  as 

administrator of Decedent’s estate despite Appellant’s claim Gonzales “wasted 

and mismanaged” the estate and “lacks the physical and cognitive abilities to 

serve as Administrator.”  See Appellant’s brief at 4, 19.  This claim is belied 

by the record. 

This Court has recognized that, 

the findings of a judge of the orphans’ court division, 
sitting  without  a  jury,  must  be  accorded  the  same 
weight and effect as the verdict of a jury, and will not 
be reversed by an appellate court in the absence of an 
abuse  of  discretion  or  a  lack  of  evidentiary  support. 
This  rule  is  particularly  applicable  to  findings  of  fact 
which  are  predicated  upon  the  credibility  of  the 
witnesses,  whom  the  judge  has  had  the  opportunity 

- 7 - 

to  hear  and  observe,  and  upon  the  weight  given  to 
their  testimony.  In  reviewing  the  Orphans’  Court’s 
findings, our task is to ensure that the record is free 
from  legal  error  and  to  determine  if  the  Orphans’ 
Court’s  findings  are  supported  by  competent  and 
adequate  evidence  and  are  not  predicated  upon 
capricious  disbelief  of  competent  and  credible 
evidence. 

n  re  Estate  of  Bechtel,  92  A.3d  833,  837  (Pa.Super.  2014)  (citation 

Instantly,  the  orphans’  court  found  that  there  was  no  evidence 

presented in this matter that an immediate medical or cognitive emergency 

existed  that  warranted  Administrator  Gonzales’  removal.    Specifically,  the 

orphans’ court reasoned as follows:

  I

[R]emoval  was  unnecessary  because  [Administrator 
Gonzales]  did  not  allege,  nor  was  any  evidence 
presented  that  a  medical  or  cognitive  emergency  or 
condition  existed  that  warranted  removal.  While 
[Administrator Gonzales] has Parkinson’s disease and 
suffers some hand tremors, by his own admission his 
cognitive  functioning  has  not  diminished.    [Notes  of 
testimony,  5/18/22  at  12-13.]    Consequently,  we 
found  that  he  currently  possesses  the  physical  and 
cognitive  ability  to  serve  as  administrator  of  the 
estate.    Furthermore,  in  our  May  24,  2022  Order 
denying the petition for removal, we stated that it was 
our  intention to  schedule a hearing on  the merits of 
the  outstanding  objections  to  the  accounts  and 
motions for surcharge no later than October of 2022. 
Pending  the  decision  of  this  Honorable  Court,  we 
continue  to  be  hopeful  that  a  hearing  to  resolve 
outstanding issues relative to the estate could be held 
in  the  near  future,  at  which  time,  [Administrator 
Gonzales]  would  be  relieved  of  his  duties  as

serving as administrator of the estate, we respectfully 
submit that Appellant’s appeal should be dismissed. 
 

Orphans’  court  opinion,  9/14/22,  at  7  (notes  of  testimony  citation 

Following our thorough review, we discern no abuse of discretion on the 

part of the orphans’ court in reaching this decision.  The orphans’ court found 

the testimony of Administrator Gonzales credible, and we are precluded from 

reweighing  the  evidence  and  substituting  our  judgment  for  that  of  the 

factfinder.  See In re Estate of Bechtel, 92 A.3d at 837. 

Accordingly, we affirm the orphans’ court’s May 24, 2022 order denying 

the petition to remove Administrator Gonzales as administrator of Decedent’s
