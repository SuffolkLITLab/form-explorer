In Re:  43rd Judicial District 
 

38 MM 2020 
 
Petition for Emergency Judicial Order 
Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2) 

 

Petition for Emergency Judicial Order Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2) 
 

TO THE JUSTICES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT: 

Margherita Patti-Worthington, President Judge of the 43rd Judicial District, 

hereby files the following Petition for Emergency Judicial Order Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 

No. 1952(B)(2) and in support thereof, avers as follows: 

1. 

On March 16, 2020, we declared a judicial emergency in response to the 

COVID-19 Pandemic. 

30, 2021. 

2. 

By subsequent orders, we extended the judicial emergency through June 

3. 

On June 21, 2021, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered an order 

stating “[e]ffective July 6, 2021, operation of the Unified Judicial System shall return to 

pre-pandemic status. All courtrooms, adjacent judicial facilities, chambers, and offices 

within the Unified Judicial System shall be fully opened and staffed by judges and other 

4. 

On June 24, 2021, in response to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s June 

21st Order, we filed a “Petition for Emergency Judicial Order Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 

1952(B)(2),” which was granted, in part, by Order of the Supreme Court dated June 29, 

personnel.” 

2021. 

5. 

The Supreme Court’s June 29th Order allowed this Court to “continue to 

suspend any state or local rule that restricts the use of advanced communication 

 

technology (ACT) in court proceedings,” with certain qualifications, which this Court has 

followed. 

District. 

6. 

On August 19, 2021, this Court filed a second petition, seeking to extend 

the suspension of rules that restrict the use of ACT, citing specific statistics regarding 

the rising number of COVID-19 cases in this County and Pennsylvania, as well as the 

below average vaccination rates and high transmission rates in the Forty-Third Judicial 

7. 

This Court’s August 19th Petition was denied without prejudice for failure to 

“sufficiently detail how the Forty-Third Judicial District is presently experiencing a 

county-specific judicial emergency justifying the requested relief under Rule of Judicial 

Administration 1952(B)(2).” 

8. 

For the following reasons, we again request that the Pennsylvania 

Supreme Court grant permission for this Court to continue to suspend any state or local 

rule that restricts the use of advanced communication technology (ACT) in court 

proceedings, through December 31, 2021 as a proactive, preventative and necessary 

measure and in support thereof avers: 

a. 

The full vaccination rate in the 43rd Judicial District is currently 

under the average for all of Pennsylvania and our daily case count 

continues to rise. Monroe County has seen a recent surge in 

COVID-19 cases: the 7-day average on July 6, 2021 was 2 while 

the 7-day average as of August 6, 2021 was 24, representing a 

1100% increase in just one month. Moreover, the 7-day average 

continues to rise, most recently to 39 on August 29, 2021. 

b. 

Our local medical experts have opined that the statistics are 

artificially low due to lower than average testing rates in the 

community. 

 

c. 

Despite the potential for artificially low numbers, Monroe County is 

classified as a “high” transmission zone, with an incidence rate of 

142.7 per 100,000 residents—the third highest in Pennsylvania, 

above larger jurisdictions including Philadelphia and Allegheny 

d. 

Additionally, average daily hospitalization rates in Monroe County 

continue in an upward trend and, more urgently, the percentage of 

ICU beds used for COVID-19 cases has increased 10% over the 

Counties.  

last week. 

e. 

The statewide statistics are likewise increasingly troublesome. In 

this Court’s August 19th Petition, we cited a 7-day average for all of 

Pennsylvania of 2,098 new COVID-19 cases. This week, the 7-day 

average is 3255—a 55% increase in less than two weeks.  

f. 

The Delta Variant of COVID-19, in conjunction with continued low 

vaccination rates and increasing breakthrough infections, has 

proven particularly contagious and poses significant health, safety, 

and welfare issues. A recent uptick in COVID-19 cases and 

exposures among court and court-related employees and staff, 

despite requiring masking and social distancing (as possible) inside 

all Court Facilities, has required quarantining of staff and judicial 

officers. 

g. 

Notwithstanding, all courts in the 43rd Judicial District have been 

and have remained open since our declaration of judicial 

emergency with health and safety measures in place that have 

enabled us to avoid any major outbreaks of COVID-19 among court 

and court-related employees and staff. 

 

h. 

We have been able to remain consistently open and operational by 

using both ACT and in-person proceedings at our Magisterial 

District Justice offices and the Court of Common Pleas. ACT has 

been vital in our ability to remain open. 

i. 

The continued use of ACT in Preliminary Hearings, Preliminary and 

Formal Arraignments, Pretrial Conferences, Guilty Plea Hearings,  

Bench Warrant Hearings, Sentencing Hearings, Post Sentence 

Motions Hearings, Bail Hearings, and PCRA Hearings is necessary 

during this COVID-19 surge in Monroe County. The availability of 

ACT as an alternative to conducting in-person proceedings in the 

above matters allows this Court to limit the number of people in the 

Courthouse, overall, and the courtrooms, individually, to prevent the 

spread of COVID-19, and increase the availability of lawyers to 

handle multiple matters across multiple courtrooms or counties. 

ACT also allows this Court to continue conducting these types of 

proceedings with individuals incarcerated at state correctional 

facilities, to further cut down on transportation-related exposure. All 

judges and staff have been and will continue to preside in the 

courtroom and Court Facilities.  

j. 

Since March of 2020, we have had 8,050 criminal dispositions, 

including 21 jury trials and 20 bench trials. We have been working 

consistently over the last several months to reduce the backlog of 

cases that resulted from the initial state-wide shut down of Court 

Facilities. We have been able to maintain these numbers, despite 

space limitations, through the use of ACT. In our Courthouse, we 

are limited, based on safe social distancing standards, to selecting 

k. 

Nearly every Custody petition filed in this Court requires either a 

 

only one jury at a time in our largest courtroom, as opposed to 

multiple juries in multiple courtrooms. Additionally, throughout the 

course of a jury trial, we must internally simulcast the proceedings 

to another location in order to maintain proper public access. 

Furthermore, we have been conducting all bench trials via ACT in 

an effort to free Courtroom space for jury trials to keep cases 

moving through the system in a fair and efficient manner. 

hearing or a conciliation conference. Just last month, we had 

approximately 124 Custody petitions filed. These hearings and 

conciliations are conducted utilizing ACT. Without the use of ACT, 

we would be entirely unable to process our current Custody 

caseload. As explained above, Court Facility space that can be 

effectively used with proper social distancing is at a premium and 

must be used for jury trials where possible. By being able to 

conduct Custody hearings and conciliations via ACT, we do not 

have to divert precious Court Facility space, we can protect the 

litigants, including children who are not yet eligible for vaccination, 

and Court officers involved, and we can keep up with the ever 

increasing Custody filings without compromising on space, safety, 

or efficiency. 

l. 

The use of ACT has been favorably received by our justice partners 

in that it has proven efficient and effective in allowing the courts of 

the Forty-Third Judicial District to move matters through the system. 

The continued use of ACT will allow for further prompt resolution of 

cases.  

 

m. 

Additionally, the vaccination rate of our local jail population (31%) is 

well below the statewide average and ACT has proven to increase 

the safety of prisoners while providing a cost-effective alternative to 

the often unnecessary transport of prisoners to and from in-person 

proceedings.  

n. 

85% or more of preliminary hearings are waived and the Magisterial 

District Justice offices of this Judicial District do not provide enough 

space to effectively implement social distancing precautions. ACT 

proceedings in this Judicial District have and continue to be 

invaluable to the health, safety, and welfare of all involved while 

maintaining the ability to move cases through the judicial process. 

o. 

For example, with the use of ACT proceedings for incarcerated 

individuals, we have been able to avoid transporting these 

individuals to MDJ Offices by police vehicles, which are small and 

confined and offer no ability for social distancing, and then back to 

the jail, where there is limited space to effectively quarantine. If this 

Judicial District were forced to abandon our pandemic-related ACT 

practices, these types of exposures could easily spark a 

widespread infection at the jail. 

p. 

This Court seeks permission to continue using ACT in the manner 

we have been since the beginning of this pandemic pursuant to the 

definition of “emergency” as “an event or events that . . . poses a 

threat to the health and safety of court personnel, court users or the 

public,” Pa. R.J.A. No. 1950, in order to prevent a major outbreak of 

COVID-19 at the jail or in any judicial facility, and to continue 

processing matters safely, fairly, and expeditiously. 

 

WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that in consideration of efficiencies in 

reducing backlog, cost effectiveness, and the health, safety, and welfare of the public, 

court and county employees, and the judges and staff of the 43rd Judicial District, this 

Court provide the following relief: 

1.  Authorize the President Judge of the 43rd Judicial District to suspend any 

state or local rule that restricts, directly or indirectly, the use of ACT in court 

proceedings until December 31, 2021, with the exception of Rule of Criminal 

Procedure 600, to allow the continued use of ACT where at all possible and 

practicable for any and all proceedings within this Judicial District. 

Respectfully submitted,
