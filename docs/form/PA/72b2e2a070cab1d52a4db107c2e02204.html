HUMAN TRAFFICKING ON 
JUDICIAL EDUCATION RADAR

A number of recent judicial education programs focus on recognizing, understanding 
and addressing human trafficking crimes – including 14 Minor Judiciary Education Board 
(MJEB) trainings for the 2019-2020 curriculum tailored to magisterial district judges, 
and a Continuing Judicial Education (CJE) seminar in November for trial and appellate 
judges. 

Both of these programs were paid for using STOP Grant funds, a federal violence 
against women grant, see pages 4 and 5.

The Villanova Law Institute to Address Commercial Sexual Exploitation (CSE), 
in conjunction with MJEB Executive Director Susan Davis
Administrator Amy Kehner

Amy Kehner, developed the MJEB trainings.

judges.

RECOGNIZING SIGNS AND 
IDENTIFYING VICTIMS 

Dr. Marita Lind from St. Christopher’s 
Hospital for Children in Philadelphia 
was invited to speak at the Nov. 7 CJE 
seminar about the commercial sexual 
exploitation of children, explaining to 
judges where and how it can occur.

She spoke to the myriad of factors 
that contribute to vulnerability in child 
trafficking which are often taken into 
account when traffickers are recruiting 
their victims – this includes a potential 
victim’s age, family, community and 
medical factors. 

Potential victims are often recruited 
in places like malls and jails, but it’s 
becoming increasingly prevalent for 
traffickers to target their victims online.

Jamie Pizzi, Esq., Justice for Victims 
Fellow at Villanova CSE Institute, 
presented at three of the October 
MJEB trainings.

In the MJEB training, Pizzi explained 
that in order to get justice for these 
victims, they first need to be identified 
as victims. 

“Many victims don’t understand the 
difference between domestic violence 
and human trafficking, which leads 
to a lot of human trafficking victims 
thinking they were just in an abusive 
relationship,” Pizzi said at the MJEB 
training.

“While on the 
surface, a case 

could look like a 
prostitution or 
domestic violence 
case, the key 
components to 
recognize in human 
trafficking crimes 
are force, fraud 
and coercion.”
Jamie Pizzi, Esq.,  
Justice for Victims 
Fellow

Law enforcement is beginning to 
understand the signs that could 
indicate when an individual who 
has been prostituted, is actually 
themselves a victim,” she said. 

In fact, continually getting convicted of 
prostitution could point to underlying 
human-trafficking crimes. 

“72 percent of human-trafficking 
survivors have already had prior court 
interaction,” Pizzi said. 

While on the surface, a case could look 
like a prostitution or domestic violence 
case, the key components to recognize 
in human-trafficking crimes are force, 
fraud and coercion. 

In the MJEB training, Pizzi went on 
to explain that traumatic responses 
are subjective and may vary between 
victims. 

Like traumatic responses, coercion is 
also subjective and may depend on 
the tactics the abuser used – which is 
why some of the statute definitions are 
intentionally vague. 

HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND 
SAFE HARBOR LAWS

In the federal Trafficking Victims 
Trafficking Victims 
Protection Act (TVPA) enacted in 2000, 
Protection Act (TVPA)
a commercial sex act is defined as “any 
sex act on account of which anything 
of value is given to or received by any 
person.” 

Pizzi explained that anything of value 
could apply to housing, money, drugs, 
etc. – whatever the abuser may be 
holding over a victim. 

Both program presenters outlined 
the details of Act 105 of 2014
Act 105 of 2014, which 
was the first comprehensive human-
trafficking law in Pennsylvania. 

“Our goal is to educate judges about 
the relatively new human trafficking 
law in Pennsylvania. It was adopted in 
2014, but has taken quite a while for us 
and law enforcement to get used to it 
and figure out how to enforce it,”  
PJ Panella said when speaking about 
the CJE seminar. 

In the MJEB session, Pizzi said the first 
conviction by a jury trial under this Act 
was in Lehigh County – debunking the 
myth that human trafficking just occurs 
in major metropolitan cities. 

Both trainings also offered insight into 
Pennsylvania’s Safe Harbor Law (Act Act 
130 of 2018
130 of 2018), which aims to protect, not 
prosecute, child victims.

APPLICATION OF HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING LAWS TO THE 
COURTS

Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Lori 
Lori 
Dumas
Dumas created a specialty court called 
Working to Restore Adolescent Power 
(WRAP) Court in 2014, prior to the 

enhancements for certain human-
trafficking charges.

Another issue judges face is Rule of 
Evidence 404(b), which may allow 
a defendant’s prior bad acts to be 
brought up, but only to prove a 
material fact at issue – not to prove 
bad character.

Pizzi, in the MJEB session, had 
explained that using a victim’s prior 
criminal record to discredit them 
is unfair because in many cases, 
that record is actually proof of their 
victimization.

Wrapping up the CJE seminar, 
Superior Court Judge Mary P. Murray
Mary P. Murray 
discussed some of the main issues 
presented on appeal.

passing of safe harbor legislation. 

At the CJE seminar, she explained 
how WRAP court was designed 
to address the specialized 
needs of trafficked children in a 
compassionate, trauma-informed 
manner – a crucial aspect to 
understand in these types of cases.

Having heard one of the first human 
trafficking cases in Pennsylvania, 
Northampton County Judge 
Stephen Baratta
Stephen Baratta also addressed 
some important issues for judges to 
prepare for and be aware of in these 
types of proceedings.

Some of those include understanding 
the sensitive dynamics of a 
human-trafficking trial; protecting 
victims from any pre-trial publicity; 
anticipating evidentiary objections; 
and reviewing the sentence 

UPCOMING:

The Villanova CSE Institute will be presenting one-hour webinars covering 
topics similar to the MJEB trainings on Jan. 14 and Jan. 21 for interested 
county court staff. Additionally, their Survivor Symposium will be held on April 
2, for which AOPC is offering scholarships to five interested judges and court 
staff to attend.

HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING 
VICTIMS MIGHT:

1.  Not be allowed to speak 
to anyone alone or make 
independent plans 

2.  Not have access to 

their own travel or ID 
documents

3.  Not be in control of their 
own financial records, 
money or bank account

4.  Have very few personal 
possessions and limited 
clothing options

5.  Work excessively long/

unusual hours with little or 
no pay

6.  Not be able to clarify their 
address/living situation 

Saving time, paper and postage costs 

On March 8, 2020, a new 
expungement process for both 
magisterial district and Common Pleas 
Courts will take effect. 

The time-consuming nature of the 
existing expungement process 
requires county and magisterial 
district court staff to generate and mail 
thousands of paper expungement 
requests each month. AOPC/IT staff 
then review all of the requests and 
perform the final steps to accomplish 
expungement in the case management 
systems. 

After review, it was determined that 
it is not necessary for AOPC/IT staff 
to perform this lengthy confirmation 

process, and that courts should 
have the ability to complete the 
expungement process on their own. 

The enhancement automates all 
the tasks that court users would 
traditionally need to perform to 
complete an expungement. Major 
benefits of this new process include 
significant savings in staff time, paper 
and postage costs, as well as reducing 
the overall time for completing the 
expungement process.

Expungement orders will now be 
treated like any other court order 
where court staff can independently 
take action without AOPC/IT 
involvement. 

“This system enhancement will 
streamline the process by eliminating 
unnecessary passing of paper between 
Russel 
the courts and AOPC/IT,” said Russel 
Montcha
Montchal, AOPC/IT assistant director. 
“It allows the courts to select and 
process the cases to expunge directly 
within the case management system 
– eliminating the need to produce a 
Request for Expungement form.”

Magisterial district courts will also 
soon be allowed to expunge truancy 
offenses. The new process will be 
replicated in the Magisterial District 
Judge System to permit those courts to 
similarly expunge cases directly.

County collaboration 
leads to enhanced 
court security 

“The AOPC has also helped a lot through the years, with 
certain training and grant funds provided to us,” Donofrio 
said. “Making sure we’re securing each court equally has 
required us to manage that money.”

With the upcoming relocation of one of their MDJs, she 
explained that they plan to use the funds they receive next 
year to secure that new building. 

In Indiana County, a unique collaboration between the 
courts, county commissioners and Sheriff’s office has 
allowed for steady enhancements in court security. 

Referencing the ongoing progress of the MDJ Security 
Task Group, Rob Granzow
administrator, assured counties that they aren’t on their own. 

Rob Granzow, AOPC Judicial District Security 

William 
A few years ago, Indiana County President Judge William 
MartinMartin and Indiana County District Court Administrator 
Christy Donofrio
Christy Donofrio sat down with their Sheriff and magisterial 
district judges (MDJ) to come up with long-term security 
goals for their courts. 

Recognizing the fiscal restraints and their responsibility 
to provide equitable security to each court office, they 
gradually began phasing in parts of their plan – adding a 
little more to it each year. 

Progress began with the installation of interior and exterior 
cameras (especially focused on parking areas) in all 
magisterial district courts, which the Sheriff’s office monitors 
in real time through a state-of-the-art system in their office. 

Court security enhancements evolved to better protect 
magisterial district court staff, including the ability for judges 
to conduct arraignments via video conference and two 
deputies that rotate between four of their MDJ offices. 

“The deputy sheriff salaries come out of the Sheriff’s 
budget, but it all comes from the county budget and our 
commissioners signed off on that, having recognized the 
need and the potential danger that was there, especially 
after what happened in Fayette County,” President Judge 
William Martin explained. 

In a rural county where MDJ offices are not always located 
near a police station, the Sheriff and commissioners soon 
recognized after active shooter drills that response time was 
a concern and eventually agreed to start with two deputies 
– a compromise from the four originally requested. 

When discussing how they overcame some of the 
budgetary concerns involved, Donofrio and PJ Martin 
explained that none of this happened overnight.

“This all came as a result of communication – we 
communicate a lot with our Sheriff and commissioners, 
especially when it comes to things that are security-related,” 
Donofrio said. 

“Budget time wasn’t the first time that security issues 
with commissioners came up… when you go to the 
commissioners, sometimes the answer is no. It’s not a 
personal thing, but there’s only so much money in the 
budget, and if they say no, come back later,” PJ Martin 
added.

especially when it 
comes to things that 
are security-related,” 

Donofrio said.

“Our office is keenly aware of opportunities to enhance 
security for magisterial district courts, and are fully engaged 
in executing a road map to bring those resources to bear in 
a uniform manner statewide,” he said. 

As Indiana County continues to expand their already 
impressive security measures, they advised other counties 
looking to enhance their security to begin by first getting a 
plan together and gradually increasing communication with 
other county officials. 

Their ongoing progress comes as a result, not of technology 
or extra funding, but of consistent communication and 
professional collaboration with county officials who share a 
mutual concern for safety. 

“The most important thing was really having everyone 
in leadership, including the PJ, recognize that we have a 
responsibility to provide our citizens access to justice – and 
to us, that also includes safety,” Donofrio said.

AOPC produces community-outreach campaign to help 
strengthen children, families and communities

Over the past few months, the Office 
of Children and Families in the 
Courts (OCFC) worked closely with 
AOPC/Communications to create 
a community-outreach campaign – 
Families are Worth it. 

The campaign highlights the 
significant role family, close friends 
and community members play in 
helping children in the child welfare 
system grow up healthy and happy. 
The purpose of the campaign is to 
encourage community members to 
work alongside child welfare agencies 
and courts to support families.

keeping kids safely in their own homes, 
neighborhoods, schools and places of 
worship. Focusing on the well-being 
of the child as well as the entire family 
is incredibly important in providing 
the tools children and families need to 
facilitate success.

As part of the campaign, 11 counties in 
Pennsylvania currently participating in 
The Family Engagement Initiative will 
use a customized video and poster to 
encourage community involvement – 
because communities help strengthen 
families and families help strengthen 
communities.

and lawyers recognize the benefits of 

The video encourages anyone living 
or working in each of the 11 counties 

to volunteer their time, be a mentor 
or support families in need by lending 
a helping hand with their skills and 
services.

At this time, participating counties 
include Beaver, Blair, Butler, Clinton, 
Fayette, Lackawanna, Northampton, 
Snyder, Tioga, Union and Venango. 

“These counties are a part of a special 
initiative that furthers collaborative 
efforts between the judiciary and 
the child welfare agency to enhance 
meaningful family involvement in the 
child welfare system,” said Sandy

How much money has AOPC intercepted from lottery prizes?

Last year, AOPConnected reported 
on a new law, known as the Lottery 
Intercept, that took effect in October 
2018 requiring the Pennsylvania Lottery 
to first check with the Administrative 
Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) 
for any outstanding court judgements 
before awarding any winnings over 
$2,500. 

As a result of the lottery intercept 
process, the AOPC has intercepted 

more than $363,000 on 178 cases 
statewide between December 2018 
and September 2019. 

During the reporting timeframe, court-
ordered obligations were found to exist 
for 105 people. The AOPC reported 
the total amount owed to the courts by 
notifying the Department of Revenue, 
which was then deducted from the 
prize amount and used to satisfy those 
obligations.

You may recall that all Pennsylvania 
Lottery winnings over $2,500 were 
already subject to intercept by the 
Department of Human Services for 
child support obligations. The law that 
took effect last year added two more 
department checks to that process 
including the Department of Revenue 
for outstanding tax obligations and of 
course, the AOPC.

Government lawyer of the year award 

The recognition is awarded to a government lawyer who is 
making a difference for the profession and for the people of 
Pennsylvania.

“I am delighted that my colleague and friend is receiving 
this well-deserved recognition,” said Court Administrator 
of Pennsylvania Tom Darr. “Andrea may not be the classic 
‘government lawyer’ as a practitioner, but every day she 
combines her legal knowledge, administrative skill, astute 
intuition and personal warmth to drive initiatives, solve 
problems and guide staff in support of the judiciary. As my 
retirement signals the end of twenty-plus years working with 
her, nothing is more pleasing than to see Andrea honored.” 

She joins fellow AOPC recipients Gregory Dunlap, Esq., 
chief counsel (2001) and Lisa A. Siciliano, Esq., Berks 
County deputy court administrator (2003).

“The importance of public service was imprinted on my 
heart and mind early on,” said Tuominen. “I consider myself 
privileged to have served so many years in support of the 
Judiciary, and with so many who have worked to maintain a 
strong and independent court system.”

Government Lawyer of the Year Award.

Maintaining parent-child 
relationships in prison

To reduce the adverse effects a child 
experiences when their parent is 
incarcerated, Clarion County President 
Judge James Arner helped create 
and implement a prison program that 
arranges for inmates to have weekly 
visits with their children.

Developed in 2008, Kid Konnection 
aims to reduce a child’s sense of 
loss or abandonment. It also helps 
normalize the family’s situation by 
allowing inmates to dress in street 
clothes and providing age-appropriate 
toys during the visits. 

“When we were thinking of starting 
our program, I met with the child 
psychologist who was conducting our 
child custody mediations and obtained 
advice on the needs of kids of different 
ages, and on the types and frequency 
of contact needed with their parents,” 
said President Judge Arner. 

“We believe children have 
benefited from having 
continuing contacts with 
their incarcerated parents 
and believe we have helped 
maintain parent-child 
relationships for at least 
some of the inmates,”  
Judge Arner said. 

(CYS) work with the warden to review 
applications for admission to the 
program and make recommendations 
to President Judge Arner.  

“The program is performance and 
behavior based,” Clarion County 
Corrections Warden, Jeff Hornberger 
explained. “There are certain eligibility 
requirements that inmates must meet 
in order to participate in this program.”

Adult and Juvenile Probation Services 
and Children and Youth Services 

Only inmates with children 12 years old 
or younger are eligible to participate, 

8

and they must be taking parenting 
classes at the jail – having already 
completed at least two modules 
(roughly eight to 10 classes). 

President Judge Arner explained 
that the behavior and attitudes of the 
inmates’ participating in this program 
tend to improve because they do not 
want to lose their visits, and they also 
now have an incentive to complete the 
parenting program.

Thomas Farrell  
and Paul Killion

“On behalf of the Court, I would 
like to thank Paul for his 17 years 
of commitment and dedication 
to ensuring the highest integrity 
of the attorneys practicing in this 
commonwealth,” Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas 
G. Saylor said. “We wish him well in 
his retirement and look forward to 
welcoming Mr. Farrell as the new Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel.” 

Farrell has been in private practice 
for 19 years, during which time 
he defended criminal cases from 
capital murder to white collar crime, 
conducted internal investigations for 
municipalities and public authorities, 
handled complex civil litigation 
ranging from whistleblower cases to 
environmental Clean Air and Clean 
Water actions and represented 
professional athletes in congressional 
hearings.

He previously served as an AUSA 
in Pittsburgh and as an asst. federal 
public defender in the Eastern District 
of New York, after starting his career as 
a law clerk for Hon. Gustave Diamond 
of the Western District of Pennsylvania.

Farrell served as a hearing officer for 
the Disciplinary Board for six years 
and recently served on the Supreme 
Court’s Investigating Grand Jury Task 
Force.

“I consider this appointment a great 
honor but also humbling. It’ll be quite a 
challenge to live up to the standard of 
excellence Paul Killion established for 
this office, but I’m eager to contribute 
to the professionalism and integrity of 
the legal profession in Pennsylvania,” 
Farrell said.

D-Board Chief 
Disciplinary 
Counsel retires

After 17 years as Chief Disciplinary 
Paul Killion, Esq. will retire 
Counsel, Paul Killion, Esq.
from the Disciplinary Board of the 
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania at the 
end of January. 

During his time with the Disciplinary 
Board, he has managed the 
investigation and prosecution 
of all disciplinary cases in the 
commonwealth. Before his 
appointment in 2002, Killion 
maintained a private practice in 
Harrisburg for 17 years where he 
specialized in white-collar criminal 
defense cases.

Killion began his career with the 
U.S. Department of Justice in 1970 
serving as a trial attorney. He also 
served as an Assistant United States 
Attorney (AUSA) in Harrisburg and an 
economic crime coordinator in Boston, 
Massachusetts. In the early 80’s, he 
was the director of the Medicaid fraud 
section in the Pennsylvania Attorney 
General’s office. 

“We have made dramatic 
improvements to the disciplinary 
system with the assistance of volunteer 
board members and a dedicated 
professional staff,” said Killion. “These 
actions have helped immensely in 
our mission of protecting the public 
and maintaining the integrity of the 
profession. It has been most rewarding 
to participate in these achievements.” 

Paul will be succeeded by Thomas 
Farrell, Esq., partner at Farrell Reisinger 
& Comber, LLC in Pittsburgh.

Leadership 
changes in 
the Pa Courts

The new year will bring leadership 
changes to the AOPC and Supreme 
Court. 

After more than 30 years of service, 
State Court Administrator Tom Darr 
Tom Darr 
has announced his retirement at year’s 
end. 

Tom began his tenure with the AOPC 
as director of legislative affairs and 
communications, advancing to director 
of administration soon thereafter. He 
was appointed deputy state court 
administrator in 1996 and state court 
administrator in 2015.

“Beginning with former Governor Dick 
Thornburgh, it has been a privilege to 
serve in two branches of Pennsylvania 
state government for more than 38 
years,” Darr said. “As is true with 
everyone who comes to Harrisburg 
with a new governor, the adrenalin to 
‘do good’ is high. That was true for 
me in 1979 and has been a guiding 
principle through my much longer 
tenure with Pennsylvania’s court 
system.  

“I have been deeply gratified to 
work for six chief justices and so 
many Supreme Court justices whose 
dedication to the law and to public 
service has been inspiring and also an 
education for this non-lawyer.  Their 
respective commitments to public 
service have been unequivocal in my 
experience.”   

Among his other significant 
contributions, during his time with the 
AOPC he focused on the development 
of the Judicial Computer System (JCS) 
by helping to encourage the legislature 
and successive governors to provide 
the JCS with financial support.

Tom also worked with representatives 
of the Judiciary’s sister branches of 
government to create Pennsylvania’s 
Interbranch Commission on Juvenile 
Justice, in the aftermath of illegal 

10

(l to r): Terry Sachs, Geoffrey Moulton and Tom Darr

actions by two judges in Luzerne 
County.  

On behalf of the Supreme Court and 
the late Chief Justice Ralph Cappy, 
Tom wrote the initial concept paper 
for development and design of the 
Pennsylvania Judicial Center, whose 
construction he supervised for the 
judiciary.

Geoff Moulton, Esq.
Geoff Moulton, Esq., current counsel to 
the Supreme Court, will succeed Tom 
as state court administrator. Geoff has 
devoted the bulk of his career to public 
service.  Before taking his current 
position in 2018, he served as an 
appointed judge on the Pennsylvania 
Superior Court, as first deputy general 
counsel to Governor Wolf, and as an 
assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia.  

In addition, he has been chief counsel 
to a U.S. Senator, taught for many years 
at Widener University Delaware Law 
School and represented media clients 
in private practice.  Following his 
graduation from Columbia Law School 
in 1984, he served as a law clerk on 
both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme 
Court.

Terry Sachs, Esq.
Terry Sachs, Esq., an experienced trial 
lawyer and accomplished appellate 
advocate, has been appointed by the 
Court to serve as Counsel to the Court.

Terry has more than 35 years of 
experience as a civil litigator, including 
20 as a trial attorney. 

She currently serves as shareholder 
and co-chair of the appellate and 
post-trial practice group at Marshall 
Dennehey Warner Coleman & Goggin 
in Philadelphia.

During her tenure in private practice, 
she has argued before the U.S. 
Supreme Court, and before all levels 
of the state and federal appellate 
judiciary in Pennsylvania including 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit and the Superior and 
Commonwealth Courts.

In her new role, Terry will provide 
assistance and advice to the Court on 
a broad range of issues, primarily with 
respect to non-adjudicative matters. 
She will also serve as the Court’s 
liaison to the Board of Law Examiners, 
the Continuing Legal Education Board, 
the Disciplinary Board, the Interest 
on Lawyer Trust Accounts Board and 
the Lawyers Fund for Client Security 
Board.

Best wishes to Tom in his retirement 
and welcome to Geoff and Terry in 
their new roles. 

Legislative roundup by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

The House and Senate will convene in voting sessions a few weeks during the remainder of 2019. 

Comprehensive Election Code reforms 

District attorney vacancies 

A number of Election Code changes were enacted in Act 
77 of 2019, which the governor signed on Oct. 31. The 
act extended the voter registration deadline from 30 days 
prior to the election to 15 days. It allows voters to vote via 
absentee ballot up until 8 p.m. on the day of the election. 
Practically, depending on the delivery method chosen – 
mail or hand carry – voters will have to mark ballots so they 
are received by the election bureau on or before Election 
Day. Qualified voters who are not otherwise entitled to vote 
absentee are eligible under the act to vote by official mail-in 
ballot, falling into the same category as an absentee voter. 

Perhaps most notably, Act 77 eliminated the straight-party 
voting option. 

The provisions of the act apply to elections held on or 
after April 28, 2020, which is the date of the 2020 general 
primary. 

Finally, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has exclusive 
jurisdiction to hear challenges to numerous substantive 
provisions of Act 77. This includes the elimination of straight-
party voting and the provisions governing absentee and 
mail-in voting. Any such suit would have to be filed in 180 
days. 

School police officers

Act 67 of 2019, which became effective in August, removed 
language from law that granted school police officers with 
the same arrest powers exercised under authority of law 
or ordinance by the police of the municipality in which the 
school property is located. House Bill 1881, introduced 
by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, seeks 
to restore that language, including the provisions that 
the action must be authorized by the court. The bill was 
reported from the House Education Committee and requires 
full House and Senate approval as well as the signature of 
the governor to become law. 

Senate Bill 902 requires that upon vacancies in the 
office of district attorney in fourth through eighth class 
counties, the Court of Common Pleas must appoint the first 
assistant district attorney (ADA) to fill the vacancy upon 
a showing that he/she meets the statutory qualification 
and eligibility requirements for district attorney. If the first 
ADA is unwilling or unable to serve or does not meet the 
statutory qualification and eligibility requirements, the Court 
of Common Pleas must appoint another competent person 
who satisfies the requirements. 

Separate judicial ballots 

Article V, § 15 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth 
requires that judicial retention questions be submitted to 
the electorate on a separate judicial ballot or in a separate 
column on voting machines. Senate Bill 413 – a proposed 
constitutional amendment – seeks to remove the separate 
ballot/column language. The bill passed the Senate 49-0 on 
Oct. 22, and was referred to the House State Government 
Committee. The bill requires passage by the full House this 
session and by both chambers next legislative session in 
order to be submitted to the electorate for approval. 

Coming Up: 

It is still expected that legislation advancing reforms 
to the probation system will be considered in one or 
both chambers prior to the end of the year. Both House 
and Senate judiciary committees continue to work on 
amendments to the two reform proposals that have been 
introduced thus far – Senate Bill 14 and House Bill 1555.

director of Legislative Affairs.}

Karaoke, jokes and Eagles cheers: Philly’s beloved ‘jury duty 
lady’ turns the courthouse waiting room into a giant party

This story is reprinted with permission from the 
writer and Billy Penn/WHYY. Read the full story 
online at billypenn.com.

By Michaela Winberg, Billy Penn 

Imagine spending every single day in jury duty.

Like a civic-minded version of Bill Murray’s 
adventures in Punxsutawney, you’d report each 
morning at 8 a.m. to Philly’s Criminal Justice 
Center, then sit on hard benches and deal with 
what seems like endless waiting, before going 
home and starting all over again.

For many, that’s a dreaded scenario. But for 
Tanya Covington, that’s reality — and she 
wouldn’t have it any other way.

Covington, 55, is an administrative officer for 
the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, but 
you might know her better by her common 
moniker: “jury duty lady.” For 17 years, she’s 
welcomed jurors into the waiting room each 
morning, and with microphone in hand guided 
them cheerily through their day of service.

It’s not easy. As the emcee of civic duty, 
Covington has to put a smile on her face in 
a room where almost everyone is miserable. 
She’s got to pronounce everyone’s name 
correctly, and ensure no one freaks out over 
the sheer mundanity of the legal system.

Covington is a staple in Philly — so much so 
that total strangers recognize her and call her 
out on the street.

“I try to just throw my good vibes to them,” 
Covington said. “If they receive them, fine. 
If they don’t, it’s like, I’ve gotta work a little 
harder.”

It all starts with a venting session

The character of Philadelphia jury duty room is 
not unlike that of the rest of the city. To put it 
plainly, a lot of ridiculousness goes down.

Sometimes you’ve got a 7-foot fuzzy green 
mascot sitting shoulder to shoulder with you 
in the waiting room. Sometimes, the legal 
system creates budding friendships and brings 
impromptu rounds of the Eagles fight song. 
Sometimes it turns into a giant karaoke party.

It’s not all Covington’s doing, but she’s often the 
woman running the show.

12

Tanya Covington is better known as ‘jury duty lady’ 

When she first signed onto the gig, it wasn’t such a humorous 
operation, she said. The collective attitude surrounding civic duty was a 
major downer.

“The first thing they want to know, even though they just got there, 
is when they leave,” said Covington, a Maryland native who’s now a 
loving grandmother and devoted Birds fan.

After dealing with the day-to-day ennui of so many Philadelphians for 
years, she felt the urge to get creative.

She slowly started incorporating some jokes into her morning routine at 
the courthouse. And they actually seemed to land. It felt to Covington 
like the moods of the public servants she shepherded were improving, 
and the days were getting better.

By now, she’s got it down to a science.

Each day starts with a group venting sesh. She’ll prime all the jurors 
with a depressing yet unavoidable truth: They’re not going anywhere. 
Jury duty lasts all day, and they have no reason to expect an early 
dismissal.

“They’re like, ‘Ugh,’” Covington said. “And I’m like, ‘Let it out, let it out. 
We’re going to get this out of our system and we’re going to have a 
good day.’”

She regularly refers folks to the free coffee and cakes available in the 
waiting room. She streams game shows on the TVs constantly.

“Price is Right comes on at 11,” Covington said, three hours into duty 
and the exact time that folks in the waiting room need a pick me up.

Then there’s the part of the job that calls for rattling off unfamiliar 
names. From her podium at the front of the waiting room, Covington 
is tasked with calling roll, pronouncing the names of every single juror 
before sending them on their way.

The key, she said: Don’t be afraid to mess up.

“Don’t ask me where I got ‘Mary Louise’ from. That says 
‘Mark Louis,’” Covington joked last week to a round of 
jurors. The crowd laughed with her.

The “jury duty lady” persona is all an act — Covington will 
say so herself. And unlike most performers, she’s got the 
benefit of a guaranteed group of spectators.

She’s not always met with a warm response. Covington 
has to steel herself when people are in irreparably terrible 
moods generated from missing time at work or waiting 
around extra long.

 “I’m just the messenger,” she said. “I can’t please 
everybody. But if I can please someone and get them OK 
with me, that makes me happy.”

Performing with a ‘captive audience’

“This is like, I am performing,” she said. “I just have a captive 
audience. You’re not leaving!”

The waiting room suggestion boxes are also proof of her 
impact.

“It’s not uncommon to have positive comments about 
Tanya,” said Martin, her boss. “They say things like, ‘We 
need more people like her around here,’ and ‘She’s a breath 
of fresh air.’”

Here’s the real tea about Covington: the Queen of the 
Courts is actually quite shy. During a one-on-one interview, 
her entertaining wit was almost overcome by her nerves.

Covington’s favorite part? Meeting Philadelphians from all 
walks of life. No one is immune from judicial service, and 
she gets to greet them all.

“To be honest with you, she’s quiet,” said Patrick Martin, 
director of jury commission and Covington’s direct report. 
“She’s reserved. But when she goes out into the room, she’s 
a totally different person.”

“You’re all in one room. It’s like, ‘Who am I going to 
encounter that I can talk to?’” she said. “We don’t know each 
other from outside, but you always find common ground.”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
