NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

URTIS TYRONE THOMAS, JR.       

 

Appellant 

 No. 2161 EDA 2022 

Appeal FROM the PCRA Order Entered July 20, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-15-CR-0002351-2010,  
CP-15-CR-0004682-2010 

EFORE:  BOWES, J., McCAFFERY, J., and SULLIVAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY BOWES, J.: 

 

 

     FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

Curtis Tyrone Thomas, Jr. appeals pro se from the order dismissing his 

petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (“PCRA”).  We affirm. 

By way of background, Appellant entered a negotiated guilty plea at two 

related  docket  numbers  on  February  23,  2011.    At  docket  number  2351  of 

2010, he pled guilty to one count of possessing an instrument of crime (“PIC”) 

and  was  sentenced  to  five  years  of  probation  (“PIC  Docket”).    At  docket 

number 4682 of 2010, Appellant pled guilty to one count of robbery and one 

count  of  conspiracy  to  commit  robbery  and  was  sentenced,  respectively,  to 

three  to  ten  years  of  incarceration  and  ten  years  of  probation  (“Robbery 

Docket”).  All terms were set to run consecutively, for a total sentence of three 

to ten years of incarceration followed by fifteen years of probation.  Appellant

case.   

did  not  file  post-sentence  motions  or  a  direct  appeal  to  this  Court  in  either 

With respect to the Robbery Docket, Appellant timely filed his first PCRA 

petition pro se in October 2011, asserting that the victim did not identify him 

as the robber at the preliminary hearing and that he was innocent.  Counsel 

was appointed and filed a petition to withdraw pursuant to Commonwealth 

v.  Turner,  544  A.2d  927  (Pa.  1988)  and  Commonwealth  v.  Finley,  550 

A.2d 213 (Pa.Super. 1988) (en banc).  After filing Rule 907 notice, the PCRA 

court dismissed Appellant’s petition without a hearing and granted counsel’s 

petition to withdraw.  Appellant did not seek relief in this Court.1 
____________________________________________ 

1  Chronologically,  the  next  pertinent  entries  pertain  to  a  probation/parole 
violation.    From  what  we  can  glean,  Appellant’s  probationary  term  at  each 
docket was revoked and reinstated on June 12, 2017, as a result of a violation.  
No post-sentence relief was sought and Appellant does not now challenge the 
violation proceedings or sentence.  The certified record contains minimal detail 
surrounding  these  proceedings,  but  it  is  nonetheless  clear  that  in  2017, 
Appellant had not yet commenced the probationary tail of his sentence. 
 

Pursuant  to  Commonwealth  v.  Simmons,  262  A.3d  512  (Pa.Super. 
2021) (en banc), Appellant was not required to comply with the conditions of 
probation  before  he  began  serving  the  probationary  terms.    Therefore,  his 
noncompliance  did  not  permit  the  anticipatory  revocation  of  his  orders  of 
probation.  Ordinarily, the resulting illegal sentence would obligate us to sua 
sponte vacate the revocation sentence and remand for reinstatement of the 
original probation sentence.  See Commonwealth v. Conley, 286 A.3d 313, 
318  (Pa.Super.  2022)  (holding  that  “because  [Conley]  had  not  yet  begun 
serving  his  consecutive  terms  of  probation  at  the  time  he  violated  the 
conditions of his [county intermediate punishment], he was not yet required 
to comply with the conditions of his consecutive terms of probation [and] . . . 
we  are  constrained  to  vacate  the  July  15,  2021  judgment  of  sentence  and 
remand  for  the  trial  court  to  reinstate  the  original  .  .  .  orders  imposing 
consecutive  terms  of  probation”).    However,  as  discussed  infra,  Appellant’s 
(Footnote Continued Next Page)

J-S03014-23 

 

As  to  the  PIC  Docket,  Appellant  pro  se  filed  his  first  PCRA  petition  in 

October 2020.  Although he only listed the PIC Docket on the pro se form and 

the proceedings unfolded solely on that docket, the underlying claim related 

to both dockets.  Specifically, Appellant argued that his original sentence was 

illegal because his PIC and conspiracy convictions should have merged with 

his robbery conviction for sentencing.  The PCRA court appointed counsel, who 

filed a Turner/Finley letter based on Appellant’s petition being untimely filed 

without any applicable exception.  After providing notice of its intent to dismiss 

the  petition  without  a  hearing  because  it  was  untimely,  the  PCRA  court 

dismissed the petition and granted counsel’s request to withdraw.  As before, 

Appellant did not seek relief in this Court.   

Instead, on January 20, 2022, Appellant pro se filed the PCRA petition 

that is the subject of this appeal.  Again, Appellant filed the petition only at 

the  PIC  Docket,  despite  raising  the  same  challenge  to  the  legality  of  his 

original sentence at both dockets and adding a claim that prior counsel was 

____________________________________________ 

PCRA  petition  that  forms  the  basis  of  this  appeal  was  untimely  filed.  
Accordingly,  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  to  address  even  glaring  illegality 
issues.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Fahy,  737  A.2d  214,  223  (Pa.  1999) 
(“Although legality of sentence is always subject to review within the PCRA, 
claims must still first satisfy the PCRA’s time limits or one of the exceptions 
thereto.”  (citation  omitted)).    With  all  that  being  said,  we  observe  that  the 
revocation court, by reinstating the original probationary terms, imposed the 
remedy that we would have ordered on remand.  Thus, Appellant’s revocation 
sentence does not run afoul of either the spirit or, ultimately, the letter of the 
Simmons holding as he was not sentenced anew following the anticipatory 
probation  violations,  but  instead  only  had  his  original  probationary  terms 
reinstated.

J-S03014-23 

ineffective for failing to raise the issue in the trial court or on direct appeal.  

The  PCRA  court  again  issued  Rule  907  notice  because  the  petition  was 

untimely, but this time directed the clerk of courts to docket the petition at 

both  the  PIC  Docket  and  the  Robbery  Docket.    As  a  result,  the  matter  has 

thereafter proceeded at both dockets.  Appellant filed two responses, arguing 

the merits of the underlying claims, and the PCRA court dismissed his petition. 

Appellant timely filed a single notice of appeal from the order dismissing 

his petition at both docket numbers, in apparent violation of Commonwealth 

v. Walker, 185 A.3d 969 (Pa. 2018) and Pa.R.A.P. 341.  Both Appellant and 

the PCRA court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.  Appellant raises the following 

issues for our consideration: 

 

1)  Did  the  lower  court  err  when  it  failed  to  grant  relief  where 

[Appellant] was sentenced to an illegal sentence? 
 

2)  Did  the  lower  court  err  when  it  failed  to  grant  relief  where 
[Appellant’s]  charges  of  robbery,  crim[inal]  conspiracy  and 
possessing  instrument  of  a  crime  should  have  merged  but 
didn’t, resulting in an illegal sentence? 
 

3)  Was  [Appellant’s]  petition  for  PCRA  timely  filed  under  one  or 
more of the exceptions listed under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)? 
 

4)  Did  the  trial  court  err  in  [its]  failure  to  articulate  sufficient 

reason in support of the sentence? 
 

5)  Was  [Appellant’s]  counsel  ineffective  in  raising  this  issue  at 
sentencing or  direct appeal and  did  not inform [Appellant]  of 
legality of sentence thus hindering any due diligence in appeal 
matters? 

Appellant’s brief at 2 (capitalization altered).  At the outset, we must overcome 

two procedural hurdles before we may reach the merits of Appellant’s issues.   

- 4 - 

J-S03014-23 

First,  because  of  the  apparent  Walker  violation,  this  Court  issued  an 

order directing Appellant to show cause as to why the appeal should not be 

quashed.    Appellant  responded  that  there  was  a  breakdown  in  the  court 

system.  This Court discharged the show-cause order and referred the matter 

to the instant merits panel.  The Note to Rule 341 and the holding in Walker 

“require  a  bright-line  rule  that  where  one  or  more  orders  resolves  issues 

arising  on  more  than  one  docket  or  relating  to  more  than  one  judgment, 

separate notices of appeal must be filed.”  Commonwealth v. Larkin, 235 

A.3d 350, 352 (Pa.Super. 2020) (en banc) (cleaned up).  However, this Court 

“may overlook the requirements of Walker where. . . a breakdown occurs in 

the  court  system,  and  a  defendant  is  misinformed  or  misled  regarding  his 

appellate rights.”  Id. at 354.  Here, the PCRA court’s dismissal order advised 

Appellant  that  “he  ha[d]  thirty  days  from  the  date  of  this  order  to  file  an 

appeal[.]”  Order, 7/20/22 (emphasis added, cleaned up).  Accordingly, we 

agree with Appellant that the PCRA court misadvised him that he only needed 

to file one notice of appeal from the order dismissing his PCRA petition as to 

both dockets.  Finding that there was a breakdown with respect to this issue, 

we decline to quash.   

 

Proceeding over that first impediment, we next must determine whether 

Appellant’s petition was timely filed, as neither this Court nor the PCRA court 

has jurisdiction to consider an untimely PCRA petition.  See Commonwealth 

v. Ballance, 203 A.3d 1027, 1030-31 (Pa.Super. 2019).  All PCRA petitions, 

including second or subsequent petitions, must be filed within one year of the 

- 5 - 

J-S03014-23 

date that the underlying judgment of sentence becomes final.  See 42 Pa.C.S. 

§ 9545(b)(1).  The PCRA statute provides that “a judgment becomes final at 

the conclusion of direct review, . . . or at the expiration of time for seeking 

the review.”  42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3).   

Instantly, Appellant challenges the original February 23, 2011 judgment 

of sentence, which became final on both dockets on March 25, 2011, or thirty 

days  after  the  time  for  filing  a  direct  appeal  in  this  Court  expired.    See 

Pa.R.A.P. 903.  Thus, to be timely, any PCRA petition had to be filed within 

one  year,  or  by  March  26,  2012.2    The  instant  petition,  filed  in  2022,  was 

patently untimely.  Therefore, Appellant had the burden to plead and prove 

one  of  the  enumerated  exceptions  to  the  PCRA’s  time-bar  before  the  PCRA 

court could consider the merits of any of his claims.  In this respect, the PCRA 

statute provides as follows: 

Any  petition  under  this  subchapter,  including  a  second  or 
subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the 
judgment  becomes  final,  unless  the  petition  alleges  and  the 
petitioner proves that: 
 

(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of 
interference  by  government  officials  with  the  presentation 
of the claim  in violation of the Constitution or laws of this 
Commonwealth  or  the  Constitution  or  laws  of  the  United 
States; 

____________________________________________ 

2 Since the thirtieth day fell on a Sunday, we utilize the next business day for 
computation purposes.  See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1908 (“When any period of time is 
referred to in any statute, . . . [and w]henever the last day of any such period 
shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, or on any day made a legal holiday by the 
laws of this Commonwealth or of the United States, such day shall be omitted 
from the computation.”).   

- 6 - 

ii)  the  facts  upon  which  the  claim  is  predicated  were 
unknown  to  the  petitioner  and  could  not  have  been 
ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or 

iii)  the  right  asserted  is  a  constitutional  right  that  was 
recognized  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  or 
the  Supreme  Court  of  Pennsylvania  after  the  time  period 
provided in this section and has been held by that court to 
apply retroactively. 
 

  (

  (

42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1).  A petitioner invoking one of these exceptions must 

file  a  petition  “within  one  year  of  the  date  the  claim  could  have  been 

presented.”  42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2).   

In the case sub judice, Appellant failed to invoke any of the timeliness 

exceptions in his pro se petition.  In subsequent correspondence, he claimed 

that counsel’s ineffectiveness prevented him from timely filing a PCRA petition 

and  that  his  subsequent  learning  of  the  alleged  illegality  of  his  sentence 

constituted a newly-discovered fact.  See Response 2/4/22 (“I did not know 

about the consecutive sentencing . . . until I maxed out my parole in 2020, 

thus  hindering  any  effort  to  discover  that  I  was  illegally  sentenced.”); 

Response 7/15/22 (“By my counsel being law intelligent and still not informing 

me  of  the  illegal  sentence,  that  in  itself  is  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel 

thus hindering my appeal process and/or discovery of the case law that led 

me here.”); Notice of Appeal, 8/12/22 (asserting the newly-discovered facts 

exception and arguing that counsel did not inform him at the time of sentence 

of the legality of the sentence and “counsel was ineffective in assisting [him] 

in the knowledge of the legality of the sentence”); Rule 1925(b) Statement, 

- 7 - 

J-S03014-23 

J-S03014-23 

9/2/22  (claiming  counsel  “did  not  inform  defendant  of  the  legality  of  the 

sentence  thus  hindering  due  diligence  and  discovery  of  this  issue”).    On 

appeal, Appellant does not address the timeliness of his PCRA petition, instead 

solely arguing the merits of his merger claim.   

With respect to the newly-discovered facts exception, a petitioner must 

plead and prove that: 

(1) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown 
and (2) could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due 
diligence.    Due  diligence  requires  reasonable  efforts  by  a 
petitioner, based on the particular circumstances, to uncover facts 
that may support a claim for collateral relief, but does not require 
perfect vigilance or punctilious care. 
 

Commonwealth v. Hart, 199 A.3d 475, 481 (Pa.Super. 2018) (cleaned up, 

emphasis in original).  The PCRA statute “clearly and unambiguously requires 

any petition filed pursuant thereto to ‘be filed within one year of the date the 

judgment  becomes  final,  unless the  petition alleges  and  the  petitioner 

proves’  one  of 

the 

three  exceptions  quoted  above.   42  Pa.C.S. 

§ 9545(b)(1)[.]”    Commonwealth  v.  Derrickson,  923  A.2d  466,  468 

(Pa.Super.  2007)  (cleaned  up,  emphasis  in  original).    In  other  words,  it  is 

solely to the petition that a PCRA court looks to determine if a petitioner has 

pled  and  proved  an  exception  to  the  PCRA’s  time  bar.    See  id.  (affirming 

dismissal of Derrickson’s PCRA petition as untimely where he failed to allege 

an exception in his petition, alleged an exception for the first time in response 

to the court’s notice of intent to dismiss, and did not seek leave to amend his 

petition to include an allegation that one of the exceptions applied). 

- 8 - 

J-S03014-23 

 

Herein, Appellant failed to plead, much less prove, an exception in his 

petition.    However,  even  if  we  were  to  consider  the  totality  of  his 

correspondence following the filing of the instant PCRA petition, we would still 

conclude that he failed to plead or prove an applicable exception.  It is well-

settled  that  “a  claim  of  ineffective  assistance of counsel does  not  save  an 

otherwise  untimely  petition  for  review  on  the  merits.”    Commonwealth  v. 

Fahy,  737  A.2d  214,  223  (Pa.  1999).    Insofar  as  Appellant  claims  that  his 

discovery  of  case  law  renders  his  untimely  petition  timely,  “[o]ur  Supreme 

Court has held that subsequent decisional law does not amount to a new fact 

under section 9545(b)(1)(ii) of the PCRA.”  Commonwealth v. Brandon, 51 

A.3d 231, 235 (Pa.Super. 2012) (cleaned up).   

Finally,  Appellant  signed  the  guilty  plea  colloquy,  which  set  forth  the 

negotiated, consecutive sentencing scheme detailed hereinabove.  See Guilty 

Plea Colloquy, 2/23/11, at 3-4.  Moreover, he was present in open court when 

the court explained the negotiated sentencing agreement and sentenced him 

accordingly.   See N.T., 2/23/11, at 17 (“After the ten year parole period is 

up, son, then you’re under my supervision for 15 years.”), 19 (imposing “ten 

years of probation consecutive to the parole period on count one robbery” and 

“five years of probation consecutive to the probation imposed on count seven, 

the conspiracy count[,]” for “a cumulative sentence of three to ten years in 

prison followed by 15 years of probation”).   While the legal import of those 

statements may not have impressed upon Appellant at that time, the fact of 

- 9 - 

J-S03014-23 

his negotiated, consecutive sentences was unequivocally known to Appellant 

at the time he entered his plea.  See Commonwealth v. Marshall, 947 A.2d 

714,  721–22  (Pa.  2008)  (“[T]he newly-discovered  facts  exception  is  not 

focused  on  newly  discovered  or  newly  willing  sources  for  ‘facts’  that  were 

already  known.”  (emphasis  in  original)).    Therefore,  neither  his  recent 

realization of the consecutive nature of his probation sentences nor his reading 

of the guilty plea transcript can constitute newly-discovered facts. 

Based  on  the  foregoing,  Appellant  has  failed  to  plead  and  prove  an 

exception to the PCRA’s time-bar.  Accordingly, the PCRA court did not err in 

dismissing his PCRA petition as untimely filed.  Therefore, we affirm the order 

- 10 - 

of the PCRA court. 

Order affirmed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
