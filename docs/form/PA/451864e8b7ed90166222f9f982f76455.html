Comment 

See  also  204  Pa.  Code  Ch.  221  (regulations  relating  to  language  access  for 
persons with limited English proficiency and for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing). 
These  terms  are  included  here  for  convenience  to  aid  in  readily  understanding  the 
requirement of providing meaningful access under these Rules. 

The  definition  of  court  services,  programs,  and  activities  encompasses  those 
administered  under  the  authority  of  the  court,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  domestic 
relations, probation, pro se clinics, cases involving court-appointed counsel, or alternative 
dispute resolution.  

Court services, programs, and activities provided by or contracted for by offices 
outside of the courts that have a distinct legal obligation to provide language access under 
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are not covered by these rules. Such offices include 
the  Prothonotary,  the  Clerk  of  Courts,  the  Clerk  of  the  Orphans’  Court,  the  District 
Attorney’s Office, and the Public Defender’s Office. 

Rule 261. Policy 

A. It is the policy of the UJS to provide meaningful language access to the courts for
all individuals who are Limited English Proficient (“LEP”) or deaf or hard of hearing
(“DHH”)  to  ensure that  such  persons  have due process  and equal access  to all
judicial proceedings, court services, programs, and activities. Ensuring meaningful
language  access  means  providing  timely,  accurate,  and  effective  language
services at no cost to persons who are LEP or DHH, whether requested or not.

B. Courts must review data concerning the languages for which interpreters are most
frequently requested in their courts and translate vital documents in accordance
with  the  policy  and  procedures  established  by  the  Administrative  Office.  Oral
translation  of  documents  shall  be  provided  when  a  translated  document  is  not
available.

C. A  qualified  interpreter  shall  be  provided  for  any  court  services,  programs,  or
activities involving an LEP person and in every judicial proceeding where the LEP
person is one of the following:

a principal party in interest.

1.

2.

any person when a court finds good cause for provision of interpreter
services.

D. A  qualified  interpreter  shall  be  provided  for  any  court  services,  programs,  or
activities involving a DHH person and in every judicial proceeding where the DHH
person is one of the following:

2 

a principal party in interest.

1.

2.

any person, including a spectator, who seeks a reasonable
accommodation.

Comment 

 
 Equal access to the courts and effective communication in court proceedings is 
fundamental to the legitimacy of Pennsylvania’s system of justice and the public’s trust 
and confidence in the courts. Language services for individuals who are LEP or DHH are 
essential to ensure that they are able to fully participate in judicial proceedings and court 
services,  programs,  and  activities  in  which  their  rights  and  interests  are  at  stake. 
Moreover,  the  courts have  an  interest  in  ensuring  the  integrity  of communications  with 
LEP  and  DHH  court  users  for  the  accurate  presentation  of  evidence  and  the  fair 
administration of justice.  

The UJS is committed to ensuring meaningful access to LEP court users. Title VI 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the 
ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any  program  or  activity  receiving 
Federal  financial  assistance.”  42  U.S.C.  §  2000d;  see  also  Department  of  Justice 
regulations regarding implementation of Title VI at 28 C.F.R. § 42.101 et seq. (“Title VI” 
as used in these Rules refers collectively to the statute and its implementing regulations.) 

In  addition  to  federal  law,  the  Pennsylvania  Interpreter  Act,  Act  172  of  2006, 
requires the appointment of qualified interpreters for judicial proceedings. See 42 Pa.C.S. 
§ 4412.  Act  172  and  its  implementing  regulations  direct  that  interpretation  must  be  in
person, except in certain circumstances where telephone or video remote interpretation
may be used. See 204 Pa. Code § 221.104 (relating to remote interpretation).

For persons who are DHH, meaningful access to the courts is required under 204 
Pa. Code Ch. 221, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq., the Pennsylvania Interpreter 
Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 4401 et seq., and various regulations, 28 C.F.R. §§ 42.101 et seq. 
and 28 C.F.R. §§ 39.101 et seq., implementing these laws.  

Meaningful  access  to  the  courts  also  includes  meaningful  access  to  court 
programs, services, and activities that are administered under the authority of the courts. 
The  providers  of  such  programs  may  receive  federal  funding  and,  therefore,  may  be 
independently  required  under  Title  VI  to  provide  such  access.  In  addition,  there  is  an 
obligation 
reasonable 
accommodations  necessary  to  afford  deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  court  users  equally 
effective  communications  under  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  regardless  of 
whether the vendor providing the program or service receives federal funds. A party  who 

interpreters  and  any  other 

to  provide  sign 

language 

3 

is LEP or DHH should not be required to participate in a program, service, or activity if the 
party is not able to fully participate or understand on account of language or disability. 
Courts should consider whether alternatives may be made available and, if not, whether 
a waiver of the required court program, service, or activity may be permitted.  

Except in courtroom proceedings, effective communication with persons who are 
LEP or DHH can also be facilitated through  the use of court staff who are proficient in 
languages  other than English,  in  accordance  with  the  Administrative  Office’s  policy  on 
bilingual employees.  

Rule 262. Scope 

These  Rules  apply  to  every  entity  in  the  UJS,  including  appellate,  trial,  and 
magisterial  district  courts,  as  well  as  boards,  committees,  and  offices  under  the 
administrative authority of the Supreme Court.  

Rule 263. Language Access Plans. 

A. The Court Administrator shall promulgate uniform standards for the provision of
meaningful language and DHH access through the Language Access Plan
("UJS-LAP") for the UJS. The UJS-LAP shall address the early identification of
the need for language or DHH services; provision of oral and written language
services; maintenance of data on the need for and use of language access
services; identification and translation of vital documents; and outreach and
education. The UJS-LAP shall be posted on the UJS website. The UJS-LAP shall
be evaluated and updated regularly.

B. The Court Administrator shall promulgate regulations to implement the

Pennsylvania Interpreter Act.

C. Each judicial district shall  promulgate local language access plans in conformity
with  a  template  to  be  provided  by  the  Administrative  Office.  At  a  minimum,  the
following  elements  shall  be  included  in  those  plans:  identification  of  LEP  court
users;  provision  of  interpreters  in  judicial  proceedings;  provision  of  language
access to court services, programs, and activities; translation of vital documents in
languages  most frequently  requested  in  their courts;  and  complaint  procedures.
Each judicial district shall review and update its language access plan to ensure
that meaningful access is being provided to LEP and DHH individuals in the judicial
district.  Plans  shall  be  posted  on  the  UJS  website  and  on  the  websites  of  the
judicial districts.

Comment 

On  March  28,  2017,  the  Supreme  Court  approved  the  UJS-LAP  providing  a 
framework for the provision of meaningful language access for individuals who are LEP 
or  DHH.  The  UJS-LAP  specifies  the  language  access  requirements  applicable  to 
Pennsylvania courts and identifies steps that must be taken to fully implement language 
access requirements, including but not limited to:   

Counsel, court staff, judges, quasi-judicial officers, and anyone aware of the need 
for an interpreter should notify the language access coordinator for the judicial district, or 
the court, of the person’s need for language access services.  

Courts must review data concerning the languages for which interpreters are most 
frequently requested in their courts and translate vital documents in accordance with the 
policy  and  procedures  established  by  the  Administrative  Office.  Oral  translation  of 
documents shall be provided when a translated document is not available.  

The  Administrative  Office  has  developed  and  implemented  protocols  within  the 
statewide  case  management  systems  for  early  identification  of  the  need  for  language 
services, including a multilingual Notice of Language Rights form that is transmitted with 
hearing  notices and  subpoenas.  Additionally,  the  Administrative  Office has  transmitted 
notices of the right to interpreter services for posting at courthouses and offices in the 
court system. The Administrative Office and the courts will continue to develop processes 
for documenting the need for language services as a case progresses through the UJS.  

In  instances  when  no  request  has  been  made,  and  a  person’s  need  for  an 
interpreter  is  apparent,  or  the  ability  of  a  person  to  understand  English  is  unclear,  the 
presiding judicial officer shall, after conducting voir dire, make a determination of whether 
the person is LEP or DHH and, if so, require an interpreter for a judicial proceeding. A 
sample  voir  dire  is  in  the  “Judicial  Bench  Card  for  Working  with  Interpreters:  Quick 
Reference Guide,” available on the Language Access & Interpreter Program page of the 
UJS  website,  http://www.pacourts.us.  Also  posted  on  this  page  are  the  UJS-LAP, 
Pennsylvania Interpreter Act regulations, and the judicial districts’ language access plans.
