EVALUATION BACKGROUND

As of October 2021, the State of Pennsylvania has over 120 problem-solving courts, also known as treatment 
courts, with some dating as far back as 1997. These programs serve individuals charged with crimes related to 
substance use and/or mental illness. Treatment courts provide integrated substance use treatment, behavioral 
health services, and intensive judicial supervision as an alternative to incarceration. The ultimate goals of these 
courts are to reduce recidivism, increase public safety, and provide treatment and other recovery support 
services to justice-involved individuals with substance use or mental health disorders to promote long-term 
recovery and enhance the quality of life for participants and their families. 

In March 2017, supported by a grant from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Administrative Office of 
Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) contracted with NPC Research to perform a statewide study of four treatment court 
types in Pennsylvania: Adult Drug Treatment Courts (ATC), DUI Courts (DUI), Mental Health Courts (MHC), and 
Veterans Treatment Courts (VTC). This report presents the outcome and cost evaluation of Pennsylvania’s Adult 
Drug Treatment Courts and DUI Courts. Outcome and cost evaluation results for MHCs and VTCs will be 
completed in 2022.

METHODS

Pennsylvania Statewide ATC and DUI Court Evaluation Methods

This report highlights the key findings of the outcome and cost evaluation of 38 ATC programs and 14 DUI court 
programs in Pennsylvania. The outcome evaluation measured whether the ATCs and DUI courts met their goals 
of reducing recidivism. The economic impact of the programs was evaluated through a detailed cost-benefit 
analysis. The ATC and DUI court outcomes and costs were measured against matched comparison groups of 
defendants who had been arrested and charged with a treatment court eligible arrest. The comparison group 
constructed for each ATC and DUI court program were matched to the treatment court participants (using 
propensity scores) on age, gender, race, and criminal history, including a variety of charges.

To assess the extent to which Pennsylvania’s ATC and DUI court programs were meeting the goal of reducing 
recidivism, we followed all individuals who participated in an ATC (N = 5,960) or a DUI court program (N = 2,529) 
between 2013 and 2018 (total N = 8,489) that were entered into the PAJCIS program database and the matched 
comparison groups from the same time period. The individuals in these groups were tracked through existing 
statewide databases for a follow up period of at least 2 years after ATC or DUI court program entry (or 
equivalent for the comparison groups). In addition, four focus sites were selected for a more detailed 
examination of program practices and the collection of data on county incarceration and probation.

The cost evaluation was conducted using the transactional 
and institutional cost analysis (TICA) approach in the four 
focus sites by analyzing the costs of program activities as 
well as outcome activities including arrests, new court 
cases, time in county incarceration, and time on probation. 
In addition, statewide data on court cases and time 
incarcerated along with the cost results from the focus sites 
were used to create statewide cost estimates. 

This report presents the study findings starting with 
statewide outcome and cost results for DUI courts followed 
by results for two focus site DUI courts. The outcome and 
cost results for ATC programs are then presented and are 
followed by results for two focus site ATCs. Lessons learned, 
a summary of key findings, and recommendations are 
provided at the end of the report.

KEY FINDINGS
DUI Courts: Statewide Recidivism

ALL PENNSYLVANIA DUI COURTS SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN 
RECIDIVISM FOR ALL CHARGE TYPES

Program participants showed reductions in recidivism across 
all charge types and severities up to 3 years post entry. 

Statewide, the combined rearrest rates for any charge in all 
programs averaged 16% for DUI court participants at 3 years 
post entry compared to 25% for the matched comparison 
group.

Fewer DUI Court Participants 
Were Rearrested for Any 
Offense 1, 2, and 3 Years Post 
Entry 

The percent reduction in recidivism between DUI court 
participants and the comparison group was also computed. 
While all DUI courts showed lower recidivism than the 
comparison group, the reductions in recidivism for individual 
DUI courts varied widely, ranging from 87% to 29%. The 
overall reduction in recidivism for DUI court participants 
statewide was 36%. Although most of the individual DUI 
courts had reductions in recidivism that were much higher 
than 36%, the programs with larger sample sizes had smaller 
reductions that lowered the statewide average.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVALUATION FINDINGS

Key Data Limitations

Some treatment courts deleted graduates and other participants who received treatment court 

services from their database, resulting in participant samples that include fewer successful 

participants and the possibility that DUI court graduates were included in the comparison 

group. Therefore, these evaluation findings are conservative estimates and likely underreport 

the success of these programs. More detail is provided later in this report.

KEY FINDINGS
DUI Courts: Statewide Recidivism

DUI COURTS IN PENNSYLVANIA DEMONTRATED 
REDUCED RECIDIVISM

Despite the conservative estimates for the recidivism results due to the deletion of some graduates from 
the program dataset, the majority of DUI courts in Pennsylvania demonstrated lower rearrest rates in 
their participants for all charge types studied. 

10 OUT OF 14 DUI COURTS 
SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN NEW DUI 
ARRESTS 3 YEARS POST ENTRY

While most of Pennsylvania’s DUI courts 
showed lower DUI recidivism than the 
respective comparison groups, three 
programs had similar rates of new DUI 
arrests between their participants and 
matched comparison groups. One 
program had more DUI-related arrests for 
their participants by 3 years post entry 
than their matched comparison group. 

13 OUT OF 14 DUI COURTS 
SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN NEW 
FELONY ARRESTS

Aside from one DUI court showing 
similar reductions in felony-level 
recidivism as its comparison 
group, most programs showed 
effectiveness, ranging from 10% to 
100% reductions in new felony 
arrests across DUI courts.

KEY FINDINGS
DUI Courts: Statewide Cost Results

DUI COURTS SAVED OVER $8.5 MILLION STATEWIDE

The difference in the 3-year outcome cost between all DUI court participants and the comparison group was 
$4,134 per participant, indicating that DUI court participants cost the criminal justice system less than the 
comparison group. This difference shows that there is a benefit, or savings, to Pennsylvania taxpayers and to 
society at large due to DUI court participation, mainly due to fewer rearrests, court cases, and person and 
property victimizations. If this cost offset (or savings) is multiplied by the number of DUI court participants in 
the study sample (N = 2,057), the total savings comes to $8,503,638 for the 3 years after program entry. It is 
important to restate that these results are likely conservative and actual cost savings may have been even 
greater, if data for all graduates were available for evaluation.

The figure below shows all costs that were related to, and available for, the outcomes reviewed across groups. 
As county incarceration and probation are distributed and managed locally, those data were not included in 
statewide cost calculations. However, as more comparison group members were rearrested, it is reasonable to 
conclude that they may also have increased costs associated with related county incarceration and probation 
time.

KEY FINDINGS

BLAIR COUNTY DUI COURT REDUCED RECIDIVISM 

Blair County DUI Court, implemented in 2005, reported a capacity of 50 participants at the time of the Best 
Practices Assessment in 2017. 

• Eligibility criteria includes only high-risk and high-need participants 

• Most participants were referred post plea/pre-sentence

•

In addition to alcohol, 2 out of 5 participants had a history of opioid use (prescription opioids as well as 
heroin)

Analysis of Blair County DUI Court program data showed a graduation rate of 78%, which is slightly higher than 
the national DUI court rate of 76%. Data also revealed that most participants were high functioning with over 
90% completing 12th grade or above and over half employed. 

While the program implemented many research based best practices, results from the 2017 assessment 
showed that the program used county incarceration as a sanction more than recommended and did not 
accept participants who were using medications for substance use disorders (SUD). Note: Blair County DUI 
Court no longer denies entry to participants who use medications for SUD. 

Results of the recidivism evaluation revealed that participants in Blair County DUI Court had substantially 
lower recidivism than the matched comparison group at every time point – 1-, 2-, and 3-years post-entry. At 3 
years post-entry, three times fewer DUI court participants had been rearrested compared to individuals in the 
comparison group.

BLAIR COUNTY DUI COURT SAVED ALMOST HALF A MILLION 
DOLLARS OVER 3 YEARS 

Outcome costs are those costs pertaining to each event (or “transaction”) experienced after program entry, 
not related to program activities. Over 3 years post entry, Blair DUI participants had fewer rearrests, court 
cases, and person and property victimizations than the comparison group, but more county incarceration 
days, probation/parole days, and prison days than the comparison group. 

When victimizations were not included, DUI court participants cost the taxpayer $1,545 more than the 
comparison group due to extensive time incarcerated. However, when the costs of victimizations were 
included, estimated savings per participant were $6,243 due to fewer person and property crimes. When the 
savings per participants were multiplied by the number of participants in the study (N = 76), total savings 
came to $474,468.

KEY FINDINGS
DUI Courts: Focus Site - York

YORK COUNTY DUI COURT REDUCED ARRESTS WITH ALL 
CHARGES BUT NOT ARRESTS WITH DUI CHARGES

York County DUI Court, implemented in 2010, had a capacity of 150 participants at the time of the Best 
Practices Assessment in 2017. The program takes low-, moderate-, and high-risk participants but does not 
have separate tracks for participants at varying risk levels. The program graduation rate is 72%, which is 
slightly lower than the national average of 76%. Most participants were high functioning with over 80% 
completing 12th grade or higher and two-thirds employed.

• Most participants were referred post-sentence

•

In addition to alcohol, about 1 in 5 participants also used opioids/heroin 

While the program implemented many research based best practices, assessment results showed that the 
program reported that they did not use a standardized assessment to determine level of care and used 
county incarceration as a sanction more than recommended. 

Recidivism results for York County DUI Court demonstrated that although participant rearrest rates in general 
were lower than the comparison group in Years 1 and 2 after program entry, this difference became smaller by 
Year 3. DUI rearrests were not significantly different between the participants and the comparison group at 
any time point.

It is important to note that, during the evaluation, it was discovered that York County DUI Court deleted some 
individuals from their electronic data system who had begun receiving DUI court services but were 
subsequently “rejected” for various reasons, usually within a few months of program entry. Deleting some 
participants who received program services may have led to those individuals appearing in the comparison 
group, and possibly skewed the results toward more positive outcomes for the comparison group.

Outcome costs are those costs pertaining to each event (or “transaction”) experienced after program entry, 
including new arrests, court cases, probation, incarceration, and victimizations (person and property crimes).

The difference in the 3-year outcome cost between all York County DUI Court participants and the comparison 
group was -$1,440 per participant, indicating that York County DUI Court participants cost the criminal justice 
system more than the comparison group. This result is entirely due to York County DUI Court participants 
spending more time in prison than the comparison group. All other costs are lower for the DUI court 
participants.

As described earlier, York County DUI Court deleted some individuals from their electronic data system who 
had begun receiving DUI court services but were subsequently “rejected”. Deleting some participants who 
received program services may have led to those individuals appearing in the comparison group, and possibly 
skewed the results toward more positive outcomes for the comparison group.

KEY FINDINGS
ATCs: Statewide Recidivism

ADULT TREATMENT COURT PROGRAMS HAD VARIED SUCCESS 

Many ATCs had significant reductions in recidivism while others did not, leading 

to slight reductions when averaged across all programs statewide

ATC participants in each jurisdiction were compared to individuals who were eligible for the ATC but did not 
participate. Reductions in recidivism in individual ATC programs ranged from 77% to -58%, indicating that 
some programs are having significant impacts by reducing recidivism (up to 77% lower recidivism in ATC 
participants than the matched comparison group), while others had higher recidivism (up to 58% higher in 
ATC participants). 

When all Pennsylvania ATCs are combined, the average recidivism rate was slightly lower for ATC participants 
than for the comparison group in Years 1 and 2, but not in Year 3. This pattern might indicate that program 
participants are beginning to recidivate as time passes post program exit. This indicates that these programs 
may benefit by focusing on “recovery capital” for their participants to provide them with connections in their 
community that support recover beyond their time in the programs.  It is also important to note that when all 
participants are combined in the statewide recidivism analysis, smaller recidivism reductions in larger 
programs (with many participants) offset larger recidivism reductions in smaller programs. 

While 1 and 2 Years Post Entry Showed Slightly Smaller Proportions of 
Rearrests in the ATC Group, Rearrest Rates for All Offenses Were Similar

important to review individual site results. The rearrest rate 3 years post entry ranged by ATC site from 10% 
to 62% for ATC participants. As described previously, rearrest rates for individual courts varied, with most

KEY FINDINGS
ATCs: Statewide Recidivism

UNDERSTANDING THE EVALUATION FINDINGS

Key Data Limitations

As described in the DUI court section of the report, some Pennsylvania problem-solving courts 

deleted graduates and other participants who received treatment court services from their 

database, resulting in participant samples that include fewer successful participants and the 

possibility that treatment court graduates were included in the comparison group. Therefore, 

these evaluation findings are conservative estimates and likely underrepresent the success of 

these programs. More detail about why graduates and other participants were deleted and how 

this was discovered is provided later in this report.

THE MAJORITY OF PENNSYLVANIA’S ATCs SHOWED 
REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM
Despite deletion of graduates from the problem-solving court database in some programs, the individual site 
results showed that 21 out of 34 ATCs in Pennsylvania fared better than their respective comparison groups 
for all rearrests. The sizes of ATC programs varied and larger programs with the most participants influenced 
the statewide results. One of the sites with the highest participant recidivism also had the largest number of 
participants. 

6 OUT OF 10 ATCs SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN 
DRUG/DUI REARRESTS

Most ATCs in Pennsylvania fared better than their respective comparison groups for drug- and DUI-related 
rearrests. However, in roughly 40% of ATC programs, participants had more drug- and DUI-related arrests by 3 
years post entry than their matched comparison groups. 

HALF OF ATCs SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN 
FELONY REARRESTS

About half of Pennsylvania’s ATC programs showed reduced recidivism in arrests with felony charges (ranging 
from 9% to 84%). However, the number of felony arrests across participants statewide is small (averaging less 
than 1 felony rearrest per participant by 3 years post entry).

KEY FINDINGS
ATCs: Statewide Costs

STATEWIDE ATCs SAVED OVER $46 MILLION IN 3YEARS

Over 3 years, average costs due to ATC participant outcomes in Pennsylvania were $9,036 less per ATC 
participant than costs for comparison group members. Outcome costs measured statewide include arrests, 
court cases, days incarcerated, and victimizations due to person or property crimes. These were the 
outcome costs that accrued during the 3 years after program entry and did not include local county 
incarceration or probation and parole costs (which may have increased the benefit had they been included). 
If this cost-offset (or savings) per person is multiplied by the number of participants in the study sample (N = 
5,119), the total savings comes to $46,255,650 over just 3 years. Results are likely conservative and actual 
cost savings may have been even greater, if data for all graduates were available for evaluation.

The figure below shows all available costs related to outcomes reviewed across groups. As county 
incarceration and probation are distributed and managed locally, those data were not included in statewide 
cost calculations. However, as more comparison participants were rearrested, it is reasonable to conclude 
that they may also have increased costs associated with related county incarceration and probation time.

ERIE COUNTY ADULT TREATMENT COURT DEMONSTRATED 
REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM

Erie County Adult Treatment Court (ATC), implemented in 2000, reported a capacity of 40 participants at the time 
of the Best Practices Assessment in 2017. The program reports taking only moderate- to high-risk and high-need 
participants and having separate tracks for varying levels of risk or need, but not using a standardized risk or 
needs assessment tool. The program graduation rate is 46%, which is lower than the national average of 59%. 

• Based on PAJCIS data, most participants appeared to be educated as over 80% had completed 12th grade or 

above though fewer than 20% were employed.

• Participants were split between post plea/pre-sentence and post-sentence

• About two-thirds of participants used opioids/heroin 

While the program implemented many research based best practices, assessment results showed that the 
program used county incarceration as a sanction more than recommended.

Recidivism results for the Erie County ATC demonstrated lower rates of recidivism for any type of charges and for 
drug and DUI charges than the comparison group all 3 years after program entry. However, this difference gets 
smaller by Year 3. This finding indicates that Erie County should consider building more recovery capital for 
participants in the community so that community supports for participants continue after graduation.

KEY FINDINGS

ERIE COUNTY ATC PROGRAM INVESTMENT COSTS = 
$37,377 PER PARTICIPANT

Program costs, also called investment costs, were related to each event (or “transaction”) experienced by 
those participants who exited the Erie County ATC (N = 96). Based on program data entered in PAJCIS, the 
following transactions resulted in an overall cost of just under $38,000 per participant.

• Treatment, particularly inpatient, represented the greatest cost

• Court sessions and case management, housed in the court, represented most of the remaining costs

• The cost of the Erie County ATC program is primarily related to its use of inpatient treatment

Because the Erie County ATC reported that it does not use a standardized assessment to determine level of 
care or type of service needed, it is recommended that the program implement an assessment as soon as 
possible to ensure that participants receive services that match their needs and are not receiving expensive 
inpatient care unnecessarily.

KEY FINDINGS

ERIE COUNTY ATC SAVED MORE THAN $4.6 MILLION OVER 3YEARS

Outcome costs are those costs pertaining to each event (or “transaction”) experienced after program entry, 
not related to program activities. Over 3 years post entry, Erie County ATC participants had fewer rearrests, 
court cases, person victimizations, county incarceration days, and (notably) prison days than the comparison 
group. Conversely, Erie County ATC participants had more time on probation and committed more property 
crimes (resulting in more victimizations). 

Not including victimizations, ATC participants in Erie County cost the taxpayers $44,271 less than the 
comparison group. Once costs for person and property crimes were included, the estimated savings per 
participant were $48,084. Overall, the main driver of these very large savings is the number of prison days 
experienced by individuals in the comparison group. When the savings per participant are multiplied by the 
number of Erie County ATC participants in the study (N = 96), total savings are $4,616,064.

KEY FINDINGS
Adult Treatment Courts: Focus Site – York

YORK COUNTY ATC PARTICIPANTS HAD SIMILAR RECIDIVISM 
AS THE COMPARISON GROUP

York County Adult Treatment Court, implemented in 1997, reported a capacity of 150 participants at the time of 
the Best Practices Assessment in 2017. The program used a validated risk screen (the RANT) to assist in 
determining eligibility and accepted only high-risk, high-need participants. In 2018, in response to the opioid crisis, 
York County ATC began a primary focus on participants using opioids. The graduation rate for participants in the 
study sample (those who entered the ATC between 2015-2018) was 42%, which is much lower than the national 
average of 59%. 

• The majority of participants were referred post   

plea/pre-sentence

12th grade or higher

• Most participants (over 75%) had education levels of 

• One-third of participants were employed

• Roughly 80% of participants used opioids/heroin
While the program implemented many best practices, the 
ATC reported the use of county incarceration as a 
sanction more than recommended. 

Recidivism results for ATC demonstrated that although 
participant rearrest rates for any charge and for drug 
charges were slightly, though not significantly, lower than 
the comparison group in Years 1 and 2 after program 
entry, this difference reverses in Year 3 with ATC 
participants having higher recidivism than the 
comparison group. The Year 3 finding indicates that York 
County ATC participants may benefit from the program 
building more recovery capital for participants so that 
community supports for participants continue after 
graduation. 

In addition, it is important to note that opioid users 
consistently show lower graduation rates and higher 
recidivism rates than participants who use other 
substances, and those with opioid use disorder require 
extensive and specialized services, particularly benefitting 
from medication for addiction treatment (MAT). Although 
the program focused on opioid users, they reported not 
adjusting services specifically for this population.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EVALUATION PROCESS
Data Improvements Needed

Improvements in Data Entry Practices Will Increase the Timeliness 
and Accuracy of Evaluation Results

PAJCIS data are self-reported and only 4 data elements undergo statewide validation. As a result, PAJCIS 
program data and inconsistent data entry practices hindered more robust program analyses and the ability 
to answer some research questions. While it is impossible to reduce data entry errors to zero, there are 
certain areas (outlined below) where improvement in PAJCIS data entry will enhance program case 
management as well as the ability to conduct useful evaluations. More consistent and reliable data entry 
will improve the ability of the treatment court teams to perform quality case management and for 
evaluators to understand how the programs are operating and why treatment courts are showing positive 
(or negative) outcomes for their participants. Improving data collection will ultimately allow Pennsylvania to 
further improve treatment court processes and outcomes, and ultimately the lives of their participants. 

RECOMMENDATION: Have agreements for data sharing among agencies in place 
for treatment court staffing AND for evaluation

Lack of response to data requests and delays in the provision of data after some agreements were signed led to 
postponements in completing this study. In particular, data from county prisons and probation at many of the 
focus sites were difficult to access and resulted in months-long delays in completing the ATC and DUI court 
study. Further, lack of available statewide data on veteran status required the evaluators to find and access data 
from the federal government, resulting in the veteran court evaluation occurring later than the ATC and DUI 
court study.

CLARK COUNTY RESIDENTIAL DOSA TREATMENT COURT

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EVALUATION PROCESS
Data Improvements Needed

RECOMMENDATION: Ensure consistent and reliable data entry of the following 
data elements:

Demographics and Participant Characteristics: Missing or incomplete data included participant substances 
used, substance use disorder or mental health diagnoses, and housing status information, resulting in an 
inability to accurately measure the impact of the program on participants with different substances of use 
and different diagnoses, and whether the program improved housing status. These data are not only 
important for evaluation but are crucial for effective case management and matching services to participants’ 
needs.

Case Tracking: Tracking participant case information is essential for effective participant case management 
and for assessing program effectiveness in delivering intended services. Areas that need more consistent data 
entry include tracking periods of inactivity (when participants are not engaging with the program), transfers 
to other treatment court programs, date of treatment court eligible arrest, date of referral to the program, 
and the dates of entry and exit into each phase of the program. 

Responses to Participant Behaviors: Incentives and sanctions (including county incarceration) were 
frequently incomplete or missing. This gap hampered meaningful analysis on the effectiveness of court 
responses to participant behavior. In addition, tracking responses to participant behavior allows the team to 
fine-tune their responses to each participant for more effective and long-lasting behavior change.

Drug Tests: Provide dates of all drug tests, results of drug tests, and the agency that administers each drug 
test. Many of the drug tests were missing the test result. Not having this information makes it difficult to 
track progress in the program. There were also many duplicate entries indicating multiple drug tests on the 
same day though many of these duplicate entries noted differing results (e.g., a positive and negative drug 
test result). 

Court Attendance: 2,256 of the participants (11%) had no corresponding court attendance records. Tracking 
whether participants were required to and attended scheduled court hearings is essential for analysis of 
effective treatment court implementation and the intensity of supervision.

Treatment Services: 6,842 participant treatment episodes for participants who were no longer in their 
treatment court program were missing a discharge date (67% of these were outpatient). Other important 
treatment information missing from the PAJCIS database includes the dates and hours of individual 
treatment sessions, dates of group treatment sessions, entry and exit dates for residential treatment, dates 
of mental health services, and the agencies providing each of these services. These treatment service details 
are important for measuring the dosage of treatment services and whether participants who engage in more 
treatment sessions, remain in treatment longer, and successfully complete substance abuse treatment also 
have better outcomes (i.e., graduation and lower rates of rearrest).

CLARK COUNTY RESIDENTIAL DOSA TREATMENT COURT

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EVALUATION PROCESS
Expunging Cases While Supporting Program Evaluation

Expunging Charges for Graduates
Some Pennsylvania problem-solving courts offer to expunge 
graduates’ charges that led to program entry. Expunging charges is 
an important incentive because individuals with criminal records 
face barriers to obtaining employment, housing, and benefits (health 
and social). Criminal records are expunged with positive intentions 
to increase the continued success of graduates in the community 
following successful completion of program requirements. Using the 
expunge feature in PAJCIS allows for retention of key data elements 
for graduates whose charges are expunged in order to compute 
program graduation rates and measure recidivism of all participants. 
Deleting Graduates and other participants who receive treatment 
court services from PAJCIS
Treatment courts in Pennsylvania should use the feature in PAJCIS that allows users to expunge graduates’ data. 
When this feature is used, an “expunged” indicator is associated with the graduate and all their program data. 
Some programs in Pennsylvania approached the expungement process more vigorously by completely deleting 
from PAJCIS all electronic data for graduates, as well as using the “rejected” feature to delete data for 
participants who were rejected from the program but who had received substantial numbers of services. The 
evaluation team at NPC Research determined this practice was being used after reviewing multiple versions of 
data extracted from the PAJCIS database at different times and detecting that some participants who were 
previously in the database were no longer in the database. A few focus site programs confirmed for NPC 
Research that they deleted graduates from PAJCIS. Moreover, programs that deleted graduates from PAJCIS 
deleted the data in its entirety and had no records of the graduates whose data were deleted; thus, these data 
were not available for evaluation. While there is great value in expunging criminal records for legal purposes, 
participant data must be retained to effectively evaluate treatment court programs. 
Impact of Deleted Graduates on Outcomes
As a result of data deletion practices, recidivism results may be incorrect and are conservatively skewed, meaning 
reductions in recidivism for court programs are likely larger than the results presented in this report. Deleting 
graduates would lead to conservative recidivism results for two reasons. First, programs that deleted graduates 
likely show higher average rearrest rates because non-graduates are consistently shown to be rearrested more 
frequently. Second, it is likely that deleted graduates were selected into the comparison group because they would 
have met program eligibility requirements, skewing comparison recidivism results lower. We are unable to 
estimate the full impact of deletion practices on recidivism rates because we do not know which court programs 
deleted graduates from PAJCIS, the number of graduates that were deleted, or the time periods during which 
programs regularly deleted graduates from the program database. Treatment court programs can continue to 
incentivize program entry by offering to expunge charges for graduates and can safely retain graduates’ program 
data for evaluation purposes by using the expunge feature in PAJCIS.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EVALUATION PROCESS
Improving Data Practices

#1 RECOMMENDATION
Program participants should NEVER be deleted from the PAJCIS data.

Deleting any participant data from the PAJCIS program database, especially deleting data for graduates  
or other participants who received a substantial amount of services, is a practice that negatively impacts 
evaluation results, particularly the ability of the programs to demonstrate their success.

The AOPC Responded Swiftly to Graduate Deletion Practices

Detecting that treatment courts deleted electronic program data is an unintended benefit of conducting 
this evaluation. The evaluation brought this problematic practice to the attention of AOPC leadership and 
doing so created an opportunity to address the problem. After learning from NPC Research that some 
programs deleted data completely out of PAJCIS, the AOPC modified PAJCIS to make it more difficult for 
court programs to delete admitted participants and their electronic records. The expunge feature continues 
to be available and courts have begun to be trained on properly using this feature. The AOPC should ensure 
that team members who use the PAJCIS database are fully trained in its use and perform regular ongoing 
training since team turnover in treatment courts tends to be high.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EVALUATION PROCESS
Improving Data Practices

Actions Taken to Improve Data 
Practices

PAJCIS was implemented in 2013 as a data source for 
Pennsylvania’s problem-solving courts. Use of the 
system is voluntary, but the AOPC has made several 
enhancements over the years to improve its 
usefulness for the problem-solving courts to 
encourage more data collection.

❑ In 2017, the AOPC began implementing data entry consistency and accuracy checks and inform problem-

solving courts when their data entry needs improvement.

❑ In 2018, the AOPC received a grant to move PAJCIS to the DCCM (Drug Court Case Management) platform.  
Until this point, PAJCIS was static and had not received any software updates since its inception. Moving 
PAJCIS to the DCCM platform allowed the implementation of over 50 upgrades that had been provided to 
other states over the past 5 years. The upgrades also improved user accessibility and resolved browser 
compatibility issues. On the DCCM platform, PAJCIS receives regular updates and can request system 
enhancements to further make PAJCIS useful to the field.  

❑ In 2019, AOPC implemented a grant program whereby operational problem-solving courts and those 

in the planning stage could apply for a discretionary or implementation grant. One of the conditions of 
an AOPC grant is the use of PAJCIS. In order to be reimbursed, programs must enter required data into 
the system: admissions, drug test results, judicial status hearings attendance, treatment attendance 
and sessions/dosage, probation contacts (monitoring), incentives/sanctions used, ancillary services, 
and discharges. In addition, a reporting feature was added to include “Grant Report,” which makes it 
easier for coordinators to submit their data to AOPC for review.  

❑ In 2021, AOPC began providing individualized training on PAJCIS to coordinators and various other 

team members.

Numerous additional updates and improvements have been made to increase the completeness and 
accuracy of program data. Since most data improvements were implemented after data were collected for 
this evaluation, Pennsylvania will benefit from an updated evaluation conducted with more robust data.

CLARK COUNTY RESIDENTIAL DOSA TREATMENT COURT

SUMMARY: KEY FINDINGS

KEY FINDINGS: DUI COURTS

All PA DUI courts showed reductions in recidivism

Recidivism rates varied across DUI court programs

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

10 out of 14 DUI courts showed reductions in DUI-specific recidivism

DUI courts showed reductions in felony-specific rearrests

Statewide, DUI courts saved over $8.5 million, primarily due to participants spending less time 
incarcerated

KEY FINDINGS: ATCs

• Most PA ATCs showed reductions in recidivism

Recidivism rates varied widely across ATCs with most programs showing substantial decreases in 
recidivism while some programs had increased recidivism

6 out of 10 ATCs showed reductions in drug/DUI specific recidivism

Half of ATCs showed reductions in felony specific recidivism

ATCs saved over $46.25 million statewide, also primarily due to participants spending less time 
incarcerated

CLARK COUNTY RESIDENTIAL DOSA TREATMENT COURT

SUMMARY: RECOMMENDATIONS

RECOMMENDATIONS

• Continue to provide regular trainings in 
incentives, sanctions, supervision, and 
therapeutic responses, and reduce use of 
county incarceration

• Encourage use of validated risk and need 
screening tools by all courts not currently 
using them, to ensure services are provided to 
participants based on their assessed risks and 
needs

• Explore resources for cultural competency training for staff and the availability of culturally specific 
services, particularly for individuals who are Latinx. Correlations between race/ethnicity, graduation 
rates, and recidivism rates (provided in previous reports) showed that individuals who were Latinx 
were less likely to graduate and more likely to recidivate. 

• Expunge criminal charges for graduates and train problem solving court teams on why and how to 

use the expunge feature in PAJCIS. We commend AOPC for changing the PAJCIS database (in 
December 2021) in a way that removed the ability to delete admitted participants from PAJCIS. 

• Find ways to incentivize more complete and reliable data entry into PAJCIS. Provide training and 

technical assistance in efficient and rigorous data management practices.

The results of the process, outcome, and cost evaluations should be used to inform efforts that 
strengthen treatment court effectiveness. Specifically, Pennsylvania treatment courts are encouraged to 
continue their efforts to implement changes to enhance adherence to best practices. 

Over time, as programs continue to improve their use of best practices and program data collection and 
entry have been enhanced, Pennsylvania should conduct an updated statewide evaluation. The updated 
statewide evaluation should measure recidivism and compare findings to the baseline recidivism rates 
presented in this report to determine improvement over time.
