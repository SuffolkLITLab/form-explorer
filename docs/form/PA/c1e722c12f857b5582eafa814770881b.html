ASIIM BROOKS       

 

Appellant 

 No. 333 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered September 28, 2021 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-23-CR-0002553-2019 

EFORE:  KUNSELMAN, J., KING, J., and SULLIVAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY SULLIVAN, J.: 

FILED MARCH 23, 2023 

 

Kasiim  Brooks  (“Brooks”)  appeals  from  the  judgment  of  sentence 

imposed after a jury found him guilty of two counts possession of a controlled 

substance  with  intent  to  deliver  (“PWID”).1    We  affirm  the  convictions  but 

vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for resentencing.   

 

The trial court summarized the factual history as follows: 

On February 8, 2019[,] at approximately 3:05 a.m., Officer 
Kevin Gamber (Officer Gamber) was issuing parking tickets in the 
area of the 7200 block of Lamport Road in Upper Darby[2] when 
he noticed [Brooks] unconscious in a car parked in a marked fire 
zone.    The  license  plate  came  back  as  an  Enterprise  rental 
car.  . . .  Officer Gamber attempted to wake [up Brooks].   

Upon  [Brooks]  waking,  he  rolled  the  window  down  and 
Officer Gamber requested [Brooks] exit the vehicle to ensure that 

____________________________________________ 

1 See 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30).  

 Officer Gamber testified, and the trial court found, that the area is known as 
a  high  crime  area.    See  N.T.  Suppression,  8/15/19,  at  12-13;  Trial  Court 
Opinion, 4/5/22, at 5.

he was okay and to determine if he was intoxicated.  During a pat 
down search, Officer Gamber felt [two] cell phones in [Brooks’s] 
pocket  [and  noticed  that  Brooks  was  wearing  an  expensive 
watch].  . . .    

* * * * 

When Officer Gamber questioned [Brooks] on why he was 
in the area so late at night[, Brooks] responded that he was on 
his way  to visit his  grandmother and  then fell asleep in his car, 
but  could  not  give  his  grandmother’s  home  address.    Officer 
Gamber  questioned  [Brooks]  in  order  to  determine  his  level  of 
intoxication, if any.  Officer Gamber determined that [Brooks] was 
not  intoxicated.    [Brooks]  fully  cooperated  with  Officer  Gamber 
during their interaction.   

After backup officers arrived on the scene and [Brooks] was 
identified,  Officer  Gamber  asked  for  permission  to  search  the 
vehicle, which was granted.  The three other officers who arrived 
on the scene did not interact with [Brooks] at this time and none 
of their vehicles had flashing lights.  Officer Gamber [searched the 
car]  and  located  98  baggies  of  controlled  substances[,  later 
identified as fentanyl and cocaine,] in the inner compartment area 
of the driver[’s] side door[, and the officer arrested Brooks.3] The 
time between stop and arrest lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.  

Trial Court Opinion, 4/5/22, at 2, 4 (citations to the record omitted). 

Brooks filed a motion to suppress the evidence recovered from the car 

asserting  that  he  did  not  voluntarily  consent  to  the  search.    The  trial  court 

denied the suppression motion following a hearing, and Brooks proceeded to 

____________________________________________ 

3 At trial, Officer Gamber testified that during his search he saw portions of a 
plastic bag protruding from a gap in the “master switch assembly,” the panel 
on the driver’s side door with controls for the power windows and locks.  See 
N.T.,  7/23/21,  at  35.    When  the  officer  lifted  the  master  switch  assembly 
panel, he discovered the bag containing smaller bags of narcotics.   See id.  
From the car’s center console, the officer recovered baggies and rubber bands, 
along with two bundles of cash totaling $1,080; and from the trunk, the officer 
recovered a black duffle bag containing Brooks’s identification, clothes, a list 
of  phone  numbers,  and  another  bundle  of  cash  totaling  $1,027.    See  Trial 
Court Opinion, 4/5/22, at 2.

a  jury  trial.    The  jury  found  Brooks  guilty  of  PWID  (fentanyl)  and  PWID 

(cocaine).    On  September  28,  2021,  the  trial  court  sentenced  Brooks  to 

consecutive  sentences  of  imprisonment  of  seventy-two  to  114  months4  for 

PWID (fentanyl) and thirty to sixty months for PWID (cocaine).   Brooks filed 

a  timely  post-sentence  motion,  which  the  trial  court  denied.    Brooks  timely 

appealed, and both he and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.   

      Brooks  raises  the  following  issues,  which  we  have  reordered  for  our 

review: 

1.  Whether the trial court erred in denying the pretrial motion to 

suppress physical evidence? 

2.  Whether  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to  sustain  the  verdict 
because  the  evidence  failed  to  establish  con[s]tructive 
possession  of  the  unlawful  narcotics  secreted  in  the  rental 
vehicle? 
 

3.  Whether the court abused its discretion in sentencing [Brooks] 

to an unduly harsh and excessive sentence? 

Brooks’s Brief at 10 (reordered). 

 

In  his  first  issue,  Brooks  challenges  the  validity  of  his  consent  to  the 

search  of  the  vehicle  and  claims  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  denying  his 

suppression motion.  On appeal from the denial of a suppression motion: 

Our standard of review . . . is whether the record supports 
the trial court’s factual findings and whether the legal conclusions 
drawn  therefrom  are  free  from  error.    Our  scope  of  review  is 
limited; we may consider only the evidence of the prosecution and 

____________________________________________ 

4 As discussed further herein, the Commonwealth concedes that the trial court 
imposed  an  illegal  sentence  for  PWID  (fentanyl)  because  the  minimum 
exceeded  one-half  of  the  maximum  term  of

Commonwealth’s Brief at 16-17 (discussing 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9756(b)(1)).

for  the  defense  as  remains 
so  much  of  the  evidence 
uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole.  
Where the record supports the findings of the suppression court, 
we  are  bound  by  those  facts  and  may  reverse  only  if  the  court 
erred in reaching its legal conclusions based upon the facts. 

Commonwealth  v.  Galendez,  27  A.3d  1042,  1045  (Pa.  Super.  2011)  (en 

banc)  (internal  citation  omitted).    When  examining  a  ruling  on  a  pretrial 

motion to suppress, appellate courts are limited to reviewing only the evidence 

presented at the suppression hearing.  See Commonwealth v. Bush, 166 

A.3d 1278, 1281-82 (Pa. Super. 2017). 

The Fourth  Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, 

Section  8  of  the  Pennsylvania  Constitution  protect  private  citizens  from 

unreasonable  searches  and  seizures  by  government  officials.    See 

Commonwealth  v.  Strickler,  757  A.2d  884,  888  (Pa.  2000).    “A  search 

conducted  without  a  warrant  is  deemed  to  be  unreasonable  and  therefore 

constitutionally impermissible, unless an established exception applies.  One 

such  exception  is  consent,  voluntarily  given.”    See  id.  (internal  citations 

omitted).    The  Commonwealth  bears  the  burden  of  proving,  by  a 

preponderance of the evidence, that a challenged search was constitutional.  

See  Commonwealth  v.  McCleary,  193  A.3d  387,  390  (Pa.  Super.  2018); 

see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(H).   

In consent cases, a court’s analysis begins with an examination of the 

interaction between the defendant and the police.  See Commonwealth v. 

Mattis, 252 A.3d 650, 654 (Pa. Super. 2021).  If the underlying interaction 

between a defendant and a police officer is lawful, then a court analyzes the 

- 4 - 

J-S33043-22 

 

voluntariness of the defendant’s consent, that is, whether the consent “is the 

product  of  an  essentially  free  and  unconstrained  choice  –  not  the  result  of 

duress or coercion, express or implied, or a will overborne – under the totality 

of the circumstances.”  Commonwealth v. Valdivia, 195 A.3d 855, 862 (Pa. 

2018)  (internal  citations  and  quotations  omitted).    However,  if  an  unlawful 

seizure  precedes  the  consensual  search,  the  exclusionary  rule  will  require 

suppression  of  evidence  unless  there  is  “a  sufficient  break  in  the  causal 

chain[,]”  i.e.,  that  the  search  did  not  exploit  the  prior  illegality,  and  the 

consent was voluntary.  Strickler, 757 A.2d at 889 (internal citation omitted).   

In examining the lawfulness of an interaction between police and an individual, 

our Supreme Court has stated: 

We  have  long  recognized  three  types  of  interactions  that 
occur between law enforcement and private citizens.  The first is 
a  mere  encounter,  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  consensual 
encounter,  which  does  not  require  the  officer  to  have  any 
suspicion  that  the  citizen  is  or  has  been  engaged  in  criminal 
activity.  This interaction also does not compel the citizen to stop 
or respond to the officer.  A mere encounter does not constitute a 
seizure, as the citizen is free to choose whether to engage with 
the officer and comply with any requests made or, conversely, to 
ignore  the  officer  and  continue  on  his  or  her  way.    The  second 
type  of  interaction,  an  investigative  detention,  is  a  temporary 
detention of a citizen.  This interaction constitutes a seizure of a 
person,  and  to  be  constitutionally  valid  police  must  have  a 
reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.  The third, a 
custodial detention, is the functional equivalent of an arrest and 
must be supported by probable cause.  A custodial detention also 
constitutes a seizure. 

No bright lines separate these types of encounters, but the 
United States Supreme Court has established an objective test by 
which  courts  may  ascertain  whether  a  seizure  has  occurred  to 
elevate the interaction beyond a mere encounter.  The test, often 

- 5 - 

J-S33043-22 

 

referred  to  as  the  “free  to  leave  test,”  requires  the  court  to 
determine whether, taking  into account all of  the circumstances 
surrounding  the  encounter,  the  police  conduct  would  have 
communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty 
to  ignore  the  police  presence  and  go  about  his  business.  
Whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his 
freedom to walk away, he has seized that person. 

See  Commonwealth  v.  Adams,  205  A.3d  1195,  1199-200  (Pa.  2019) 

(internal citations, some quotations, and brackets omitted). 

 

Additionally, where an officer completes an initial, lawful detention of an 

individual and then asks for consent, a court must review all coercive aspects 

of the subsequent interaction, including factors such as:  

1) the presence or absence of police excesses; 2) whether there 
was  physical  contact;  3)  whether  police  directed  the  citizen's 
movements;  4)  police  demeanor  and  manner  of  expression;  5) 
the  location  of  the  interdiction;  6)  the  content  of  the  questions 
and  statements;  7)  the  existence  and  character  of  the  initial 
investigative  detention,  including  its  degree  of  coerciveness;  8) 
the  degree  to  which  the  transition  between  the  traffic 
stop/investigative detention and the subsequent encounter can be 
viewed  as  seamless,  .  .  .  thus  suggesting  to  a  citizen  that  his 
movements  may  remain  subject  to  police  restraint;  9)  the 
presence of an express admonition to the effect that the citizen-
subject  is  free  to  depart  is  a  potent,  objective  factor;  and  10) 
whether the citizen has been informed that he is not required to 
consent to the search.

(internal  citations  and  quotations  omitted);5  accord  Commonwealth  v. 

Freeman, 757 A.2d 903, 906-07 (Pa. 2000).

5 The above factors may overlap when considering whether a seizure occurred 
and  whether  an  individual  voluntarily  consented  to  a  search,  because  both 
issues require a consideration of the objective circumstances surrounding an

On appeal, Brooks does not dispute that Officer Gamber had reasonable 

basis to order him out of the car, frisk him, and  determine whether he was 

intoxicated.  See Brooks’s Brief at 19-20.  However, Brooks argues that once 

the officer determined he was sober, the purpose of the initial detention was 

complete,  and  he  should  have  been  allowed  to  leave.    See  id.  at  20.    The 

continuing interaction with Officer Gamber, along with the arrival of the three 

backup  officers,  Brooks  asserts,  amounted  to  an  unlawful  detention  that 

coerced  his  consent.    See  id.      Brooks  concludes  that  he  was  entitled  to 

suppression  of  the  evidence  found  in  the  car,  because  “[c]onsent  is  not 

voluntary where the suspect is surrounded by police and subject to accusatory 

questioning.”  See id. at 20.  

The trial court explained its denial of Brooks’s suppression motion noting 

that  Officer  Gamber  had  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  Brooks  “was 

involved in nefarious activities” when the officer frisked Brooks.  Trial Court 

Opinion, 4/5/22, at 5.  However, the court concluded that Brooks “was free to 

leave the scene” when Officer Gamber later requested consent to search the 

car.  See id.   

 

We  disagree  with  the  trial  court’s  “free  to  leave”  analysis.    At  the 

suppression  hearing,  Officer  Gamber  testified  that  he  woke  Brooks  up  by 

banging  on  the  car  window  for  approximately  one  minute,  and  then  asked 

____________________________________________ 

interaction  between  a  police  officer  and  the  individual  giving  consent.    See 
Commonwealth  v.  Carmenates,  266  A.3d  1117,  1124  (Pa.  Super.  2021) 
(citing Strickler, 757 A.2d at 901-02).

Brooks to exit the vehicle.  Brooks complied, and the officer frisked him.  See 

N.T. Suppression Hearing, 8/15/19, at 12-13.  After the frisk, Officer Gamber 

began asking Brooks why he was in the area and Brooks replied that he was 

visiting his grandmother.  See id. at 13.  The officer and Brooks then had an 

exchange about the location of his grandmother’s home.  Brooks was unable 

to give the officer “a straight answer as to where it was or what he was doing 

in  the  area.”    Id.  at  13-14.    During  these  discussions,  Officer  Gamber 

concluded that Brooks was not intoxicated.  See id. at 20.  Approximately five 

minutes  after  Officer  Gamber  began  interacting  with  Brooks,  three  backup 

officers  arrived  in  marked  patrol  cars.    See  id.  at  14,  24.    Officer  Gamber 

“identified”6 Brooks when the backup officers arrived and then asked him for 

verbal consent to search the vehicle.  Id. at 14.  Officer Gamber testified that 

when he requested Brooks’s consent to the search the car, Brooks was free to 

leave; however, he did not expressly say so.  See id. at 23-24.   

  

Following  our  review  of  the  record,  we  conclude  that  when  Officer 

Gamber requested consent to a search the interaction constituted  a seizure 

not a mere encounter.  Brooks was clearly detained when the officer ordered 

____________________________________________ 

6  The  Commonwealth  elicited  no  testimony  about  how  Officer  Gamber 
identified Brooks, and at no point during the suppression hearing did Officer 
Gamber state that he requested or obtained any paperwork or identification 
cards from Brooks.  
 

- 8 - 

J-S33043-22 

 

him out of the car and frisked him.7  The Commonwealth failed to adduce any 

evidence about when, during his continuing interactions with Brooks, Officer 

Gamber  concluded  that  Brooks  was  not  impaired.    Moreover,  there  was  no 

meaningful break or “endpoint” that separated the initial detention of Brooks 

from the officer’s continued questioning of Brooks.  See Freeman, 757 A.2d 

at 906-07.  The transitions from the frisk to the point at which Officer Gamber 

believed Brooks  was free to leave were relatively  quick and seamless, such 

that  a  reasonable  person  would  not  have  felt  “free  to  leave,”  ignore  Officer 

Gamber’s questions, or simply disregard the request for a consensual search.  

See  Moyer,  954  A.2d  at  665,  669.    Thus,  the  trial  court  erred  when  it 

determined that Brooks was “free to leave” when Officer Gamber asked for his 

consent,  and  we  conclude  that  Brooks  was  subject  to  an  investigative 

detention when the officer asked for his consent.  See id.     

We next consider whether the seizure was lawful.  Because Brooks does 

not  assert  that  his  interactions  with  Officer  Gamber  and  the  three  backup 

officers escalated to a functional equivalent of arrest, see Brooks’s Brief at 19 

(arguing  that  Officer  Gamber  “unlawfully  detained”  Brooks),  we  assess 

whether there was reasonable suspicion to support an investigative detention 

when Brooks consented to the search.   

____________________________________________ 

7  The  trial  court  and  the  parties  do  not  dispute  that  Officer  Gamber  had 
detained Brooks during this phase of the interaction.  See Trial Court Opinion, 
4/5/22, at 5.

J-S33043-22 

 

In  assessing  whether  a  detaining  officer  has  reasonable  suspicion  to 

conduct an investigative detention, we employ the following standard: 

Reasonable suspicion exists only where the officer is able to 
articulate  specific  observations  which,  in  conjunction  with 
reasonable  inferences  derived  from  those  observations,  led  him 
reasonably  to  conclude,  in  light  of  his  experience,  that  criminal 
activity was afoot and that the person he stopped was involved in 
that activity.  Therefore, the fundamental inquiry of a reviewing 
court  must  be  an  objective  one,  namely,  whether  the  facts 
available  to  the  officer  at  the  moment  of  intrusion  warrant  a 
[person] of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken 
was appropriate. 

Commonwealth  v.  Goldsborough,  31  A.3d  299,  306  (Pa.  Super.  2011).  

Reasonable  suspicion  is  a  less  stringent  standard  than  probable  cause 

necessary to effectuate a warrantless arrest and depends on the information 

possessed  by  police  and  its  degree  of  reliability  in  the  totality  of  the 

circumstances.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Brown,  996  A.2d  473,  477  (Pa. 

2010).    The  totality  of  the  circumstances  test  requires  consideration  of  all 

information  obtained  by  an  officer  during  a  lawful  interaction.    See  In 

Interest  of  A.A.,  195  A.3d  896,  910  (Pa.  2018)  (holding  that  information 

learned during a valid traffic stop may be considered to determine whether an 

officer had a lawful basis to initiate a second detention after the traffic stop), 

abrogated on other grounds by Commonwealth v. Barr, 266 A.3d 25 (Pa. 

2021). 

 

Brooks, as noted above, argues that any basis for prolonging the initial 

detention  or  initiating  a  subsequent  detention  had  dissipated  and  that  “the 

power to detain [him] and the vehicle was exhausted” when Officer Gamber

determined  he  was  not  intoxicated.    Brooks’s  Brief  at  20.    Brooks  baldly 

asserts  that  “[a]  perceived  expensive  watch,  two  cell  phones,  whether  in  a 

high crime area or not, fall far short on the reasonable suspicion required to 

warrant” extending or initiating a new  investigative detention.  See id. at 19-

The record here shows that Officer Gamber found Brooks sleeping in a 

running  rental  car  that  was  parked  in  a  fire  zone.    See  N.T.  Suppression 

Hearing, 8/15/19, at 7-8.  After waking Brooks, frisking him, and feeling two 

cellphones in Brooks’s pocket, Officer Gamber asked why Brooks was in the 

area.    See  id.  at  12-13.    While  Brooks  indicated  he  was  going  to  visit  his 

grandmother, he was not able to give his grandmother’s address or point out 

her  home.    See  id.  at  13-14.    During  this  interaction,  the  officer  noticed 

Brooks was wearing an expensive watch.  See id. at 12.  At the suppression 

hearing, the officer summarized his suspicions as follows:     

His story didn’t add up.  It didn’t make sense what he was doing 
in the area.  He wasn’t -- gave me -- able to . . . give me a straight 
answer to where his grandmother lived.  I thought it was odd that 
he would visit a grandparent or someone of that age at 3:00 in 
the  morning.    It  was  a  high  crime  area.    He  had  multiple  cell 
phones on his person.  He had a very expensive watch.  It was a 
rental  car.    All  these  details  lead  me  to  believe  that  he  wasn’t 
being truthful with me and there was something more to what was 
going on than he was leading on. 

N.T., Suppression Hearing, 8/15/19, at 16-17.  Officer Gamber testified that 

he only identified Brooks after the three backup officers arrived.  See id. at 

14.

Following our review, we conclude that Brooks’s argument that Officer 

Gamber lacked reasonable suspicion to detain him after determining he was 

not  intoxicated  merits  no  relief.    Brooks’s  attempt  to  limit  the  scope  of  the 

investigative  detention  and  the  facts  obtained  by  Officer  Gamber  is  too 

narrow.  Having come upon Brooks asleep in a running car, illegally parked in 

a  fire  zone  at  3:00  a.m.  in  a  high  crime  area,  Officer  Gamber  had  an 

objectively reasonable basis to briefly detain and question Brooks to confirm 

his  identity,  determine  why  he  was  in  the  area  and  his  possible  travels,  in 

addition to his possible  level of intoxication.  Moreover, when assessing the 

totality of the circumstances, this Court will not separate out the information 

obtained  during  a  lawful  interaction  when  determining  reasonable  suspicion 

continued to exist to continue or re-initiate an investigative detention.  See 

In Interest of A.A., 195 A.3d at 910.  Thus, Brooks’s argument contravenes 

the  proper  application  of  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  test  and  fails  to 

demonstrate that Officer Gamber lacked reasonable suspicion to briefly detain 

and question him about the reasons for his sleeping in his car. 

 

Our final consideration in assessing the trial court’s suppression ruling 

is whether Brooks’s consent was voluntary.  See Valdivia, 195 A.3d at 862.  

Although  we  have  concluded  that  Brooks  was  subject  to  an  investigatory 

detention, we agree with the trial court that the Commonwealth established 

that his consent was not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied, 

under the totality of the circumstances.  See Commonwealth v. Cartagena, 

- 12 - 

J-S33043-22 

 

63 A.3d 294, 301 (Pa. Super. 2013) (noting that a suppression court’s legal 

conclusion are not binding on this Court and that this Court may affirm on any 

ground).  The record shows  that Officer Gamber and the three backup officers 

were  at  the  scene  in  full  uniform  when  Officer  Gamber  requested  Brooks’s 

consent to search the car.  However, none of the officers had activated their 

emergency  lights.    See  N.T.  Suppression,  8/15/19,  at  14-16.    The  three 

backup officers also remained behind Brooks’s car at a distance of about five 

to six feet.  See id. at 16.  None of the backup officers interacted with Brooks 

or had positioned themselves, or their vehicles, to block or physically control 

Brooks’s  movements.    See  id.  at  28-29.    Officer  Gamber  testified  that 

throughout  the  investigative  detention  of  Brooks,  their  interactions  were 

cordial.  See id. at 16.  Officer Gamber testified that after the frisk, he did not 

physically touch or control Brooks’s movements or restrain him in any manner.  

See id. at 15-16, 24.  Although the officer and Brooks were standing face to 

face, at no time did Officer Gamber draw his firearm or threaten Brooks.  See 

id. at 16.  According to Officer Gamber, Brooks did not hesitate in giving his 

consent  and  affirmatively  stated  that  the  officer  could  “search  the  vehicle.”  

Id.    

 

Based  on  this  record,  we  agree  with  the  trial  court’s  conclusion  that 

Brooks’s consent was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.  See 

Trial Court Opinion, 4/5/22, at 6.  Brooks’s general assertion that his consent 

was invalidated by the nature of his interactions with Officer Gamber and the 

- 13 - 

J-S33043-22 

 

mere presence of three other officers  alone fails to convince this Court that 

the  overall  nature  of  a  lawful  detention  was  so  coercive  that  his  will  was 

overborne.8  Rather, there was ample support for the court to conclude that 

Brooks’s consent was the product of a free and unconstrained choice.  Thus, 

we affirm the order denying Brooks’s suppression motion.   

 

In  his  next  issue,  Brooks  claims  that  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to 

prove his possession of the contraband recovered from the car.  Our standard 

of reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is as follows: 

We assess the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn 
therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict-winner.  We 
must determine whether there is sufficient evidence to enable the 
fact-finder  to  have  found  every  element  of  the  crime  beyond  a 
reasonable doubt.  In applying the above test, we may not weigh 
the  evidence  and  substitute  our  judgment  for  that  of  the 
factfinder.  In addition, we note that the facts and circumstances 
established  by  the  Commonwealth  need  not  preclude  every 
possibility of innocence.  Any doubts regarding a defendant's guilt 
may be resolved by the fact-finder unless the evidence is so weak 
and inconclusive that as a matter of law no probability of fact may 

____________________________________________ 

8 Brooks also emphasizes that Officer Gamber did not advise him that he was 
free to leave and did not obtain a written consent to search.  While such factors 
may  weigh  heavily,  Pennsylvania  law  does  not  regard  any  one  factor  to  be 
dispositive when considering the nature of interaction or the voluntariness of 
consent.    Cf.  Commonwealth  v.  Cleckley,  738  A.2d  427,  433  (Pa.  1999) 
(emphasizing  that  although  knowledge  of  the  right  to  refuse  a  search  is  a 
factor, a court’s focus must be on the totality of the circumstances).  We add 
that this Court has determined that a consent to a search was voluntary under 
circumstances  that  could  be  considered  more  coercive  than  those  present 
here.  See e.g. Commonwealth v. Benitez, 218 A.3d 460, 483 (Pa. Super. 
2016) (affirming the trial court’s finding that consent was voluntary despite 
the presence of multiple police officers); Commonwealth v. Rosas, 875 A.2d 
341,  345,  349-50  (Pa.  Super.  2005)  (holding  that  Rosa’s  consent  was 
voluntary  despite  the  presence  of  two  state  troopers  and  Rosa  being  in 
handcuffs following a traffic stop).   

- 14 -

be drawn from the combined circumstances.  The Commonwealth 
may  sustain  its  burden  of  proving  every  element  of  the  crime 
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  by  means  of  wholly  circumstantial 
evidence.  Moreover, in applying the above test, the entire record 
must  be  evaluated  and  all  evidence  actually  received  must  be 
considered. 

Commonwealth  v.  Bowens,  265  A.3d  730,  740-41  (Pa.  Super.  2021) 

(internal citation omitted), appeal denied, 279 A.3d 508 (Pa. 2022) 

A  conviction  for  PWID  requires  the  Commonwealth  to  prove  that  the 

defendant  “knowingly  or  intentionally  possessed  a  controlled  substance 

without  being  properly  registered  to  do  so,  with  the  intent  to  manufacture, 

distribute,  or  deliver  it.”    Commonwealth  v.  Dix,  207  A.3d  383,  390  (Pa. 

Super.  2019);  see  also  35  P.S.  §  780–113(a)(30).    Possession  may  be 

established  by  the  defendant’s  actual  or  constructive  possession  of  a 

controlled  substance.    See  Bowens,  265  A.3d  at  741.    To  establish 

constructive  possession,  the  evidence  must  show  a  nexus  between  the 

defendant and the item sufficient to infer that he had the power and intent to 

exercise dominion and control over it.  See id.  “Dominion and control means 

the  defendant  had  the  ability  to  reduce  the  item  to  actual  possession 

immediately,  or  was  otherwise  able  to  govern  its  use  or  disposition  as  if  in 

physical possession.”  Id. (internal citation omitted). 

 

Brooks  asserts  that  the  Commonwealth  failed  to  establish  possession 

because he was not in actual possession of the “narcotics that were secreted 

inside of the rental vehicle” and the evidence failed to establish constructive 

possession.  Brooks’s Brief at 29.  He argues that the trial evidence established 

- 15 - 

J-S33043-22 

 

that he was fully cooperative with the police, which is “more consistent with 

innocence rather than guilt” because it “belies common sense that a person 

who knowingly was in possession of contraband would freely and willingly give 

consent” for a search.  Id. at 30.   

 

Following our review, we discern no merit to Brooks’s argument.  The 

trial record established that Brooks was the sole occupant of a rental car and 

fell  asleep  in  the  driver’s  seat  with  the  car  still  running.    See  N.T.  Trial, 

7/23/21,  at  29-30.    The  drugs,  while  hidden,  were  located  underneath  the 

master switch assembly on the armrest located on the driver’s side door.  See 

id. at 34-35.  The master switch assembly was already loose and portions of 

the plastic bag containing the drugs was visible.  See id. at 34-36.   Moreover, 

as  noted  by  the  trial  court  other  evidence  linked  Brooks  to  the  car  and  the 

trafficking  of  drugs,  including  the  presence  paraphernalia  consistent  with 

packaging drugs, as well as large amounts of cash and a customer list located 

in a duffel bag that also contained Brooks’s identification card.  See Trial Court 

Opinion, 4/5/22, at 9; see also N.T. Trial, 7/23/21, at 38-39, 55, 122, 124.  

Thus, there was ample circumstantial evidence proving Brooks’s constructive 

possession  of  the  drugs  found  in  the  driver’s  side  arm  rest.    Brooks’s 

arguments  that  no  guilty  person  would  have  cooperated  with  the  police  or 

consented to a search of the vehicle go to the weight rather than sufficiency 

of the evidence.  Thus, Brooks’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence 

fails.  See Dix, 207 A.3d at 390.

J-S33043-22 

 

 

Brooks’s  third  issue  challenges  the  discretionary  aspects  of  the  trial 

court’s  sentence.    Before  addressing  this  issue,  however,  we  consider  the 

Commonwealth’s  suggestion  that  the  trial  court’s  imposition  of  an  illegal 

sentence renders this issue moot.  See Commonwealth’s Brief at 16-17. 

 

This  Court  may  address  the  legality  of  a  sentence  sua  sponte  and 

remand the matter to the trial court even in the absence of the preservation 

of  the  claim.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Mitchell,  986  A.2d  1241,  1244  n.3 

(Pa.  Super.  2009).      Where  the  trial  court  imposes  a  sentence  of  total 

confinement  under  the  Sentencing  Code,  the  court  must  state  a  maximum 

sentence  and  a  minimum  sentence,  which  specifies  the  date  on  which  the 

defendant,  once  jailed,  is  eligible  for  parole.    See  Commonwealth  v. 

Basinger,  982  A.2d  121,  127  (Pa.  Super.  2009).    The  Sentencing  Code 

mandates that the minimum sentence imposed “shall not exceed one-half of 

the  maximum  sentence  imposed.”    42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  9756(b)(1).    Absent  a 

contrary provision of law, the failure to comply with section 9756(b)(1) goes 

to the legality of the sentence.  See Mitchell, 986 A.2d at 1244.   

 

In the case sub judice, the trial court imposed a minimum sentence of 

seventy-two  months  of  imprisonment  for  PWID  (fentanyl),  and  a  maximum 

sentence of 114 months.  Because the minimum sentence is more than one-

half of the maximum and no contrary provision of law applied, that sentence 

violates section 9756(b)(1) and must be vacated.  See Mitchell, 986 A.2d at 

1244.  Furthermore, because the trial court imposed consecutive sentences, 

- 17 - 

J-S33043-22 

our decision affects the overall sentencing scheme.  Therefore, we vacate the 

judgment of sentence and remand this matter for resentencing.  Because we 

vacate and remand due to the illegal sentence, we decline to address Brooks’s 

discretionary aspect of the sentence claim.  See Commonwealth v. Conley, 

--- A.3d ---, ---, 2022 WL 17098985, at *7 & n.15 (Pa. Super. 2022). 

In  sum,  we  affirm  Brooks’s  convictions  for  PWID,  but  vacate  the 

judgment of sentence and remand this matter for resentencing.   

Judgment  of  sentence  vacated.    Case  remanded  for  resentencing.  

Jurisdiction relinquished.   

Judge King joins in this decision. 

Judge Kunselman concurs in the result.
