FILED:  March 22, 2023 

A.A.C.  (“Mother”)  appeals  from  the  decrees,1  entered  in  the  Court  of 

Common Pleas of Erie County, involuntarily terminating her parental rights to 

her  two  children,  A.L.V.  (born  August  2017),  and  A.J.R.  (born  March  2021) 

____________________________________________ 

1  We  have,  sua  sponte,  consolidated  these  appeals.    See  Pa.R.A.P.  513; 
Pa.R.A.P. 2138.  The parental rights of Children’s biological fathers were also 
terminated.  They are not involved in this appeal.

(collectively,  “Children”).    After  our  review,  we  affirm  on  the  basis  of  the 

opinion authored by the Honorable Shad Connelly.   

 

The trial court opinion sets forth a comprehensive review of the factual 

and procedural history of this matter, as well as a detailed summary of the 

termination hearing testimony.  In brief, Mother and Children became involved 

with the Erie  County Office of Children and Youth (“OCY”)  after  New Jersey 

Children’s Services alerted OCY to the fact that the family was traveling back 

and forth between New Jersey and Erie.  The New Jersey agency had become 

involved  with  the  family  as  a  result  of  concerns  about  Mother’s  untreated 

mental health issues, drug and alcohol use, domestic violence, and failure to 

meet Children’s needs.  After multiple attempts, OCY was able to locate the 

family at a motel where Mother had left A.J.R., then only six months old, by 

herself.    Children  were  detained  and  a  shelter  care  hearing  was  held  on 

October 14, 2021.  Upon being taken into custody, the Children were found to 

have  scabies,  strep  throat,  and  severe  diaper  rash.    On  October  15,  2021, 

OCY  filed  dependency  petitions.    A  combined  adjudicatory/dispositional 

hearing was held on October 26, 2021, after which the court found Children 

to  be  without  proper  care  or  control,  subsistence,  education,  or  other  care 

necessary for their physical, mental, or emotional health and adjudicated them 

to be dependent.  The court instituted a permanency plan and Children were 

placed in the legal and physical custody of OCY.   

 

A permanency review hearing was held on January 26, 2022, after which 

the  court  found  that  Mother  had  been  minimally  compliant  with  her 

- 2 - 

J-S05019-23 

permanency plan and  in  alleviating the circumstances  that led to Children’s 

placement.    On  February  25,  2022,  the  court  issued  an  order  conditioning 

Mother’s visitation on her being alcohol- and drug-free after Mother repeatedly 

tested positive for fentanyl.  A second permanency review hearing was held 

on May 2, 2022, after which the court found Mother to be non-compliant with 

her  permanency  plan.    The  court  further  found  that  Mother  had  made  no 

progress  toward  alleviating  the  circumstances  that  led  to  Children’s 

placement.  Finally, the court ordered that the permanency goal be changed 

to adoption.        

 

On May 10, 2022, OCY filed petitions to involuntarily terminate Mother’s 

parental rights to Children.  Following a full evidentiary hearing,2 on August 

11,  2022,  the  court  issued  decrees  terminating  Mother’s  parental  rights 

pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2511(a)(1), (2), (5), and (b).  Mother filed timely 

notices  of  appeal  and  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(b)  concise  statements  of  errors 

complained of on appeal.  She raises the following issues for our review: 

[1.]    Whether  the  Orphans’  Court  committed  an  error  of  law 
and/or abused its discretion when it concluded that termination of 
parental  rights  was  supported  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence 
pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2511(a)(1), (2) and (5)? 

[2.]    Whether  the  Orphans’  Court  committed  an  error  of  law 
and/or abused its discretion when it concluded that termination of 
parental  rights  was  supported  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence 
pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2511(b)?

2 Children were represented at the hearing by Steven E. George, Esquire, who 
also served as guardian ad litem.  Attorney George has not filed an appellate 
brief.

Brief of Appellant, at 3. 

 

In cases involving the termination of parental rights, “our standard of 

review  is  limited  to  determining  whether  the  order  of  the  trial  court  is 

supported by competent evidence, and whether the trial court gave adequate 

consideration to the effect of such a decree on the welfare of the child.”  In 

re  Z.P.,  994  A.2d  1108,  1115  (Pa.  Super.  2010).    “Absent  an  abuse  of 

discretion,  an  error  of  law,  or  insufficient  evidentiary  support  for  the  trial 

court’s decision, the decree must stand.”  In re B.L.W., 843 A.2d 380, 383 

(Pa.  Super.  2004)  (en  banc)  (internal  citations  omitted).    “[W]e  employ  a 

broad, comprehensive review of the record in order to determine whether the 

trial court’s decision is supported by competent evidence.”  Id.   

In  a  proceeding  to  terminate  parental  rights  involuntarily,  the 
burden of proof is  on the party seeking termination  to establish 
by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  the  existence  of  grounds  for 
doing so.  The standard of clear and convincing evidence is defined 
as testimony that is so “clear, direct, weighty[,] and convincing as 
to enable the trier of fact to come to a clear conviction, without 
hesitance,  of  the  truth  of  the  precise  facts  in  issue.”    It  is  well 
established 
individual 
circumstances  of  each  and  every  case  and  consider  all 
explanations offered by the parent to determine if the evidence in 
light  of  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  clearly  warrants 
termination. 

that  a  court  must  examine 

the 

In  re  adoption  of  S.M.,  816  A.2d  1117,  1122  (Pa.  Super.  2003)  (citation 

omitted).   

Parental  rights  may  be  involuntarily  terminated  where  any  one 
subsection  of  [s]ection  2511(a) 
is  satisfied,  along  with 
consideration of the subsection 2511(b) provisions.  Initially, the 
focus  is  on  the  conduct  of  the  parent.    The  party  seeking 
termination must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 

- 4 - 

J-S05019-23 

parent’s  conduct  satisfies  the  statutory  grounds  for  termination 
delineated in [s]ection 2511(a).  Only if the court determines that 
the  parent’s  conduct  warrants  termination  of  his  .  .  .  parental 
rights  does  the  court  engage  in  the  second  part  of  the  analysis 
pursuant  to  [s]ection  2511(b):    determination  of  the  needs  and 
welfare  of  the  child  under  the  standard  of  best  interests  of  the 
child.  

In re L.M., 923 A.2d 505, 511 (Pa. Super. 2007) (internal citations omitted).   

Here, the trial court terminated Mother’s parental rights under section 

2511(a)(1),3  which  provides  that  the  parental  rights  of  a  parent  may  be 

terminated where: 

(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least 
six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition 
either  has  evidenced  a  settled  purpose  of  relinquishing 
parental claim to a child or has refused or failed to perform 
parental duties. 

23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2511(a)(1).   

In terminating under subsection (a)(1), the court noted Mother’s failure 

to address “any of the issues” that led to Children’s removal, despite the best 

efforts of OCY.  Trial Court Opinion, 10/27/22, at 14.  Mother failed to attend 

parenting classes, domestic violence treatment, or mental health therapy or, 

if she did attend, claimed to have no problems.   See id.  When OCY made 

referrals for safe housing, Mother either lied about utilizing those services or 

left  because  she  would  not  follow  the  rules.    See  id.    Mother  failed  to 

participate  in  drug  treatment  programs  and  continually  denied  drug 

____________________________________________ 

3 We may affirm the trial court’s decision regarding the termination of parental 
rights with regard to any single subsection of section 2511(a).   In re L.M., 
supra.   

- 5 - 

J-S05019-23 

involvement.    On  the  “infrequent  occasions”  Mother  appeared  for  court-

ordered  urinalysis,  she  tested  positive  for  fentanyl,  while  continuing  to 

maintain that she did not use drugs.  Id. at 15.  The court concluded: 

A.A.C. has no credibility when she claims she is now attempting 
to  straighten  out  her  life.    Her  actions  throughout  [the 
involvement of OCY and New Jersey Children’s Services] evidence 
a woman who has no desire to act as a parent.  As A.A.C. testified 
[at  the  termination  hearing],  she  placed  others  before  her 
children.  Her actions corroborate that she has and will continue 
to subvert her children’s well-being for her own desires. 

. . . 

[M]other has clearly shown that she has no desire to change her 
attitude or actions toward parenting, no matter how much at risk 
it  places  her  children.    A.A.C.  rejected  all  services  and  efforts 
during the course of [OCY’s] involvement, and termination of her 
parental rights under subsection (a)(1) is appropriate. 

Id. at 16-17. 

 

 

The trial court’s findings are fully supported in the record, and we can 

discern  no  abuse  of  discretion  or  error  of  law  in  the  court’s  conclusion  that 

termination is appropriate under subsection (a)(1).   

Under  section  2511(b),4  the  court  must  consider  whether  termination 

will meet the child’s needs and welfare.  In re C.P., 901 A.2d 516, 520 (Pa. 
____________________________________________ 

4 Subsection 2511(b) provides: 

(a)  Other considerations.--The court in terminating the rights of 
a parent shall give primary consideration to the developmental, 
physical[,] and emotional needs and welfare of the child.  The 
rights of a parent shall not be terminated solely on the basis of 
environmental factors such as inadequate housing, furnishings, 
income, clothing[,] and medical care if found to be beyond the 

- 6 - 

Super. 2006).  “Intangibles such as love, comfort, security, and stability are 

involved when inquiring about the needs and welfare of the child. The court 

must also discern the nature and status of the parent-child bond, paying close 

attention to the effect on the child of permanently severing the bond.”  Id.   

 

Here,  the  trial  court  found  that  the  “evidence  demonstrated  that 

severing  contact  with  []  Mother  has  not  had  any  detrimental  effect  on  [ 

C]hildren.”  Trial Court Opinion, 10/27/22, at 18.  In fact, certain “destructive 

behaviors”  previously  engaged  in  by  A.L.V.,  the  older  child,  abated  once 

contact with Mother ceased.5  The court noted: 

[A.L.V.] no longer had night terrors or was fearful someone would 
come to the foster home and steal her.  Therapy to work through 
the traumatic events of A.L.V.’s life are ongoing and have shown 
promise.    Subjecting  a  child  to  drugs,  guns,  violence,  fear  for 
safety,  and  being  left  alone  are  not  factors  which  would  lead  a 
child to have a strong[,] positive relationship with a parent. 

 

Children are currently in a loving foster home.  While this family is not 

an  adoptive  resource,  they  are  “committed  to  treatment  for  A.L.V.”  and  to 

control  of  the  parent.    With  respect  to  any  petition  filed 
pursuant  to  subsection  (a)(1),  (6)  or  (8),  the  court  shall  not 
consider  any  efforts  by  the  parent  to  remedy  the  conditions 
described  therein  which  are  first  initiated  subsequent  to  the 
giving of notice of the filing of the petition. 

 Because she was only six months old when she was removed from Mother’s 
care, we can only surmise that A.J.R.  did not suffer the same psychological 
trauma from her exposure to Mother’s activities as A.L.V.

facilitating  a  transition  to  a  “forever  home.”    Id.  at  9,  10.    OCY  is  actively 

seeking an adoptive home for Children, who will be adopted together, as they 

are “very attached to each other.”  Id. at 10.  The court concluded that the 

interests of Children are best served by terminating Mother’s parental rights, 

and we can discern no abuse of discretion or error of law.  

 

We  have  reviewed  the  parties’  briefs,  the  certified  record,  and  the 

applicable  law  and  conclude  that  Judge  Connelly’s  opinion  thoroughly  and 

correctly  disposes  of  the  issues  Mother  raises  on  appeal.    Accordingly,  we 

affirm on the basis of that opinion and instruct the parties to attach a copy of 

that document in the event of further proceedings in this matter.

On August 11, 2022, an. order was entered terminating the parental rights of the natural 

mother, 1k.A.C. to her children A.L.V. and A.I.R.'The mother now challenges that order. A timely 

Notice o t Appeal, and A Statement Pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 1925 were filed by the A.A.C.'s counsel 

Emily I. McIski, Esquire. A review of the record supports the Court's determination that O

Jersey dildren's Services notified Erie County Office of Children and Youth " OCY" about the 

mother trIiveling back and forth betwcen New Jersey and Erie. New Jersey's involvement with the

AdjudicItion Hearing was held  on October 26,  2021,  The mother did not attend, but  was 

represen}I ed  by counsel.  The  Juvenile  Hearing  Master recommended  that  the  children  be 

adjudica,ed dependent based upon the following allegations in the Dependency Petition, which 

was acre pted by the Court, the Honorable Erin Connelly Marucci, on November 1, 2021: 

11 (A.A.C.) had unstable housing. The Agency received a referral on September 27, 2021 

tl tat A.A.C. had been terminated from a domestic violence shelter in New Jersey and had 
fled to Pennsylvania. The Agency had been unable to make contact with A.A.C. until 
October 12, 2021, due to her transient nature. She had been staying in multiple motels and 
a, ldresses since she arrived in Erie; 
21 (A.A.C.) had not ensured the safety ofthe children. The staff at one of the motels voiced 
) ncerns  about (the  mother)  leaving  the  children  unattended  and  outside  playing 
c
,
u isupervised. On October 12, 2021 when the Agency was able to locate (the mother), she 
was observed walling to a hotel room with an adult male and only one of the minor 
cl uldren.  It was later learned that (the mother) left the other minor child in the room 
ui iattended while she was gone. There were no safe sleeping arrangements for the children 
ai id (A.A.C.) admitted to co-sleepingwith the baby. Further, she was feeding the six-month 
old child inappropriate food. During this time (the mother) reported she had recently 
returned to New Jersey .for a short time and was raped while in a caregiving role for the 
cl d1dren; 

3I (A.A.C.) had a history with New Jersey Children's Services. It was reported they had 
b(•.en attempting to work. with (the mother) since March of 2021 for concerns regarding 
di )mestic violence, parental substance abuse, untreated mental health, ability to meet the 
cl :ildren's needs and concerns regarding (A.A.C.) decision making skills. They report that 
hi x engagement had not been consistent;

the moir's visitation with the children would be contingent upon her being alcohol and drug free. 

If there was a positive urine test received, there was to be no visit until the next clean urine. Judge g 

Connelly Marucci specifically noted that "the Court is not limiting the mother's visitation, just 

i  

conditioriing the visits on mother's sobriety. It is not in the children's best interest to have visits 

with mother while she repeatedly tests positive for Fentanyl" Ex. 8 p. 26; Ex 9 .26.

constant mantra to Ms. Lynch was "I'm not using drugs". (7/14/22 N.T. p. 79) . A.A.C. insisted

on two cl-ccasions in April, Judge Connelly Marucci conditioned visits on mother having clean 

urines. Als noted earlier, the Judge was concerned with the effect on the children of their mother 

being uni ter the influence of Fentanyl at visits. Caseworker Lynch rioted that the mother's last visit 

with the i Uldren was February 2, 2022 and no visits since that date. Id., pp. 83-84, 94..

Incident Iteports.from the Erie Police Department regarding 4210 Melrose Avenue. From February 

8, 2022 t hrough March 21, 2022, the police were called ten times to that address. Among the 

descripti ins of the incidents were knives and stabbings; baseball bat assaults; domestic violence 

and theftt involving money and a cell phone. Ex. 14. A.A.C. went to the Erie Police on March 16, 

2022 stat ing that someone was putting drugs in her air filter. This led to one of the police raids at 

42.10 Melrose Avenue, .and drugs, money and weapons were seized as a result (7/14122 N.T. pp. 

88--89). Itlwas determined that Luis Lopez was living at that address with. A.A.C. Mr. Lopez was 

the male ` -nth mother when the children were removed in October, 2 2 , q 1 and had claimed to be the

1 additional requirement of the treatment plan was for A.A.C. to complete a 

Pdrug and 

alcohol  

The mother completed that on March 25, 2022 but reported she did not use 

drugs at 1 he assessment so no recommendations for treatment were made, Id., p. 89, 

iV ental health treatment was another part of the treatment plan, but the mother never 

followed `through with that evaluation, Id. 

The Court ordered A.A.C. to get involved with domestic violence treatment. This was 

never acchmplished, The mother had a scheduled evaluation for February 22, 2022 for which she 

did not Jend. That session was rescheduled but once again mother did not attend. As of April 29

when her `Family reunification program was supp osed to take place. She asked to reschedule the 

appointmc nt for the afternoon. The appointment was rescheduled but A.A,C, failed to show. Id. 

Orr a potentially positive result was that the mother did go to a safe shelter on April 6 2022 P >

.L.V,  described numerous episodes in her life.  M s. Potter noted that w hat A.L.V . 

recounteld was not necessarily totally accurate, but indicated the child experienced something in 

life that manifests itself as trauma. The trauma memories expressed were from the child's time 

living w;th the mother. The child had: consistent memories of being in a car with. mother with drugs g 

and a gua. Other  memories involved domestic violence and being fearful for the safety of mother 

and chil(1l.  A,LV. would express these memories freely. The free expression of these memories 

would .of en up more memories. A.L.V. revealed exposure to guns and a robbery. The child recalled 

being in  i hotel room where there were drugs and thopolice came. A.L.V. stated she did not have 

a shirt or, and the police found her a "Paw-Patrol" shirt and put it on her, Another recalled memory 

was of trle mother being: duct-taped and put in the trunk of a car. A.L.V. said she was afraid her 

mother mIas going to be killed along with her and her baby sibling. Recently the child demonstrated

V isitation with the mother stopped in February 2022. Ms. Potter testified that without that 

visitation) the child became more regulated in the foster home, and the night terrors stopped after a 

pped a 

•r► 

few weeks. A.L.V. was no longer fearful som eone would come and kill her. Id., p. 26. 

Allthough the foster home was not an adoptive home, the foster mother was committed to 

treatment for A.L,V. Potter stated that once a child feels safe and secure, the child can go to other 

loving ad .alts. Potter described treatment as not a cute, but a continuous process to develop health 

p

children are very attached to each other. A.J.R, was 6 months old when the children were removed 

I 

from the, mother's care and turned one;. on March 25, 2022. Id., pp. 93-94. Lynch related that 

A.L.V.'•• trauma resulted in the child being diagnosed with. PTSD and RAD-Reactive Attachment 

Disordei. Mental health treatment began with A.L.V..as quickly as possible after placement as that. 

was seerll as an urgent need for A.L.V. Lynch noted that the child continues in therapy and has 

improve II to such an extent as to become "a completely different kid" . Id., pp . 95-97. 

I  
CICY is actively seeking a "forever home" for the two children w ho are viewed as a unit 

for that placement. The current foster parents, although not an adoptive resource, are committed 

l 

to a trans I idon to a forever home, That family would need to be loving yet firm, and be fully aware 

of A.L.VI's diagnoses of PTSD and RAD, as the child will test limits. Id., pp. 97-99. The Agency

Lynch. I( I., p. 122.

sever the Imother's parental rights. Lynch saw no benefit but rather harm A.L.V. in continuing a

` Hearing were held on the Agency's Petitions to Terminate the Parental Rights ofA.A.C. 
A

to A.IN and A.J.R, on July 14, 2022. This Court reviewed the testimony and evidence presented 

at the (voluntary Termination. Hearing and issued Orders on August 11, 2022. The Agency 

presentee l sufficient clear and convincing evidence justifying the termination of the parental rights 

of AA . to A.L.V. and A.JFR, pursuant to 23 Pa. C.S. §§ 2511 (a)(l),(2),(5) and (8),  and that 

terminati :)n is in the best interest of those children under 23 Pa. C.S. § 2511 (b). 

ISSUES PRESENTED 

1.  The Orphan's Court committed an abuse of discretion and/or error of law when it 

concluded that the Agency had established, by clear and convincing evidence, the 

grounds for termination pursuant to 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 2511(a)(1) that the natural mother 

has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing a parental claim to the minor child or 

has refused or failed to perform parental duties.

and whether termination of parental rights would best serve the needs and welfare of 

the child., 

4:  The Orphan's Court committed an abuse of discretion and/or error of law when it 

concluded that the Agency had established, by clear and convincing evidence, the 

grounds.for termination pursuant to 23 Pa. C.S.A. § 2511(b). Specifically, the Orphan's 

Court did not consider the trauma and impact that befalls a child upon severing the 

clearly  established  bond between natural  mother and the minor child  and  how 

permanently severing that bond: was in the best interest of the minor child. 

STANDARD OF REVIEW 

In 

reviewing an appeal from an order terminating parental rights, 

Page 12 of 19 

Appellate courts must apply an abuse of discretion standard when considering a 
trial courts determination of a petition for parental rights, (The] standard of review 
requires  an  appellate  court  to  accept  the  findings of  fact  and  credibility 
determinations of the trial court if they are supported by the record. In re: R.J.T., 
608 Pa. 9, 9 A.3d 11799 1190 (2010), 

Ifthe factual findings are supported, appellate courts review to determine if the trial 
court made an error of law or abused its discretion. Id.  An abuse of discretion does 
not result merely because the reviewing court might have reached a conclusion. Id. 
Instead,  a decision  may be reversed  for  an  abuse  of discretion  only  upon 
determination of manifest unreasonableness,, partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will. 

DISCUSSION 

L i a termination. of parental rights hearing, the initial focus is on the conduct of the parent. 

The part•• moving for termination must "prove b clear and convincing evidence that the  are 

by 

parent's s 

conduct I'i-atisfies the statutory grounds for termination delineated in Section 2511(a)." In re L.M., 

923 A.2t,, 505, 511 (Pa. Super. 2007). Once these statutory grounds exist  the court may analyze 
Y 

•' 

whether it is in the best interests of the child for parental rights to be terminated. Id. 

The Agency proceeded to seek termination under the following grounds of Section 2511: 

(a)(1) the parent by conduct which has continued for a period of at least six (6) 
months immediately preceding the filing of the petition either has evidenced a 
settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to the child, or has refused or failed 
to perform parental duties,' 

(a)(2) the repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal of the parent 
has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence 
necessary for the physical or mental well-being of said child  and the conditions 
and, causes of the incapacity,  abuse,  neglect or refusal  cannot or will  not be 
remedied by the parent; 

(a)(5) the child has been removed from the care of the parent by the Court or under 
a voluntary agreement with an agency for a period of at least six (6) months, the 
conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child continue to exist, the 
parent cannot or will not .remedy those conditions within a reasonable period of 
time, the services or assistance reasonably available to the parent are not likely to 
remedy the conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child within a 
reasonable period of time and termination of parental rights would best serve the 
needs and welfare of the child; 

Page 13 of 19 

(b) The termination of parental rights ofA.A.C. to AIN. and A.J.R. is in the best 
interest of the children. 

One major aspect of this analysis includes the "nature and status of the emotional bond 

between parent and child, with close attention paid to the effect on the child of permanently 

severing any such bond" Id. The Superior Court may affirm the trial court's decision regarding 

the term Iination of parental rights with regard to any one subsection of 23 Pa. C.S.A.. §2511 (a). In 

re .B.L. IIV., 843 A:.2d 380, 384 (Pa. Super. 2004) (en hanc), app. den. 863A.2d 1141(2004). 

I'reserving Appellant's parental rights is not an acceptable option in this case. "Parental 

duty requires that the parent act affirmatively with good faith interest and effort, and not yield to 

N 

$  

every pr  blem, in order to maintain the parent-child relationship to the best of his or her ability, 

even in 4 lifficult circumstances." in re B,N.M., 856A.2d, B47,855 (Pa. Super. 2004).  "A parent 

must uti lize  all  available resources to preserve the parental  relationship, and must exercise 

reasonat le  firmness in resisting  obstacles placed in the path of maintaining the parent-child 

relationship." Id. 

A.A.C. refused to address any ofthe issues that led to her children's removal. OCY 

put toget her a comprehensive plan to put A.A.C. in.a position to have the children returned to her 

and be Mused in a safe environment. Parenting, domestic violence treatment and mental health 

therapy iIvere all components to help A.A.C. put her life in order. She did not attend any of these 

through out her involvement with the Agency, or if she did attend an evaluation, claimed to have 

no pmbl !ms. Referrals to safe housing were made to protect her from the drug trafficking life in 

which Je was immersed, yet these efforts went for naught. A.A.C, lied about entering safe 

housing. •Cven when she appeared to accept that protections the mother left because she could not 

or would not follow the rules. 

Page 14 of 19 

The main culprit in A.A. C 's parenting failure was her drug use.. Programs offered to wean 

her off twat lifestyle were ignored by the mother. A.A.C. continually denied drug involvement. On 

the ird(Kl:quent occasions when she subjected herself to the court-ordered urinalysis, she tested 

positive Ifor Fentanyl. Her excuse was always the same— "I don't do drugs". The mother expected 

the auArities to believe her positive tests for Fentanyl were because of having sex with Luis 

Lopez vlith the drug being passed through his semen. A.A.C. tested positive for Fentanyl the day 

of the At Review Hearing on January 2f, 2022. Same excuse. Even when the Court conditioned 

the mother's visits with her children on drug free urine test to prevent their exposure to a mother 

on Fenvinyl, A.A.C. continued to fail.  This continuing failure on the mother's part led to the 

canceling of visitation from February 2, 2022 onward. Even this drastic step by the Court could 

not shake A.A.C.'s refusal to  cooperate with the programs designed to  reunite her with her 

children.I 

I 

A.L.V. was particularly traumatized by the mother's failure to provide the most essential 

element If parenting — protection of children. A.A.C. admitted to having both A.L.V. and A.J.R. 

with her during drug runs between New Jersey and Erie.. A.L.V. recounted drugs, guns, violence

A.L.V. r( I counted  police coming to their hotel room and she had no shirt on. The child remembered 
the name Iof the shirt the police put on her— Paw Patrol, Devastating specific memories of a 4 year-

old.  Theie traumas have led to problematic behaviors by A.L.V. Which are being addressed 

through Iherapy.  Patricia Potter,  the  child's therapist,  noted that  dealing with the trauma in 

A.L.V.'s life will be an ongoing concern throughoutAIN.'s life. A.L,V. and A.J.R. have a strong 

attachment and will be adopted as a unit. The foster mother has been actively involved in A.L.V's

2022 . A. A,C, now declares she is a drug addict and wants a second chance to be a mother. The 

adage, "fictions speak louder than words", obviously applies 

lies here. It is difficult to fathom how 

A.A,C, v I rants to be as mother to her children when she moved to New Jersey. The recent admission 

of being !i drug addict supports the conclusion that A.A.C. was lying to the Agency, drug treatment 

centers, , I nd thee Court, m claiming she did not do drugs. The level to which the mother w as w illing 

sink to t•y to dupe authorities is borne out by the fact she expected professionals to believe she 

was testi-L positive for Pentanyl because of sex with her boyfriend. 

s previously noted, the standard of review of a trial court's determination to  grant an 
A
I

involuntary termination of parental rights is abuse of discretion, 

The Supreme Court has stated: 

N 

"/ Wfe must defer to the trial judges who see and hear the parties and can determine the 
ct edibility to be placed on each witness and, premised thereon, gauge the likelihood of 
the success of the current permanency plan." 

It, re R.J.T. 608 Pm at 27, 9 A.M at.1,190. 

AIA.C. has no credibility when she claims she is now attempting to straighten out her life. 

Her actioilis throughout the Agency's involvement and New Jersey Children's Service involvement 

before thEIt evidence a woman who has no desire to act as a parent. As A.A.C. testified on July 14, 

she placeli others before her children. Her actions corroborate that she has and will continue to 

subvert hcx children's well-being for her own desires, 

Page 16 of 19 

'Ns Court has noted the standard of review governing termination of parental rights' case. 

Under 2 3 Pa. C.S.A.. §2511(b), no efforts by the parent after the date of notice of the filing of the 

Terminaltion Petition will 'be considered purs•Tant to cases under subsection (a)(1). Subsection (a) 

(1) is on  of the subsections being pursued by the Agency. Termination can be affirmed if one of 

the subs,-ctions is supported by clear and convincing evidence. In re BLW, supra. 

 -" p 
I

I he mother has clearly shown that she has no desire to change her attitude or actions toward 

parents ;, no matter how much at risk it places her children.-A.A.C. rejected all services and efforts 

I 

during Bite  course of the Agency's involvement, and termination of her parental rights under 

subsecti< in (a)(1) is appropriate. 

T he Agency is also proceeding under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(5). Although this Court 

believes  sufficient  evidence supports termination under subsection (a)(1),  there  is  clear and 

convinci lf g evidence supporting termination under both those subsections as well. Counsel for the 

mother alleges that the Court did not consider that the mother has not demonstrated the continued 

incapaci ly neglect or refusal to remedy the conditions which .led to the children's placement. 

Further, l:ounsel states the Court did not adequately consider the mother's efforts to remedy those 

conditions, the evidence prove otherwise. A.A.C. continued to use drugs until July 7, 2022. She 

moved t I New Jersey with her boyfriend sometime in June 2022; was arrested with him while she 

was undeIr the influence of l:entanyl on June 25, 2022. Only July 14, 2022 she admitted she was 

an addict Ito this Court and proclairned she had been clean for a week. These facts utterly fail to 

demonstrate that A.A.C. has made any effort to remedy the conditions which led to her children's 

placement. The mother's claim that being cleats for a week since being in treatment fails to provide 

convincing evidence of her efforts to remedy those conditions. A.A,C, lied about drug use and 

minimized issues in her life, She couldn't bring herselfto be off drugs in order to visit her children. 

Page 17 of 19 

One we -k sober and in treatment, with criminal charges pending, does not provide this Court with. 

sufficielit credible evidence that A..A.C.'s efforts .are genuine, 

J?inally, Counsel for the mother states: that repercussions of severing the bond between 

A.A.C. Mid her children have not been sufficiently considered b this  

r  y Court. Again the evidence 

l  

derrtonsl rates otherwise. A.L.V.'s destructive behaviors minimized once visits with her mother 

stopped! The: child no longer had ni  t terrors or was fearful someone would come © • e t the 

home al steal her. Therapy to work through the traumatic events of A.L.V.'s life are ongoing and 

have Shown promise. Subjecting a child: to drugs, 

$ ,of 
violence  fear for 

safety and being left 

guns, 

alone arc not factors which would lead a. child to have a strong positive relationship with a parent. 

A.I.R. W as too young to understand what the exposure to these events constituted. However, she 

is attach)d to A.L.V, and will be adopted along with A.L.V. into the same loving  p  family. 

adoptive famil . 

T a evidence demonstrated  that severing contact w ith  their mother has not had any 

detrimell effect on the children. Not permitting these children to have to face the continued 

lifelong La and instability they have been through in their short lives is of paramount concern 

to this It 

AI.A. C. has continuous)  demonstrated she cannot  r will  1 ' 

not place her children's needs 

continuously 

 
f

above hell*  own. She refuses to accept responsibility for her actions. The skills  and judgment 

necessaryl)  to provide for the emotional well-being of her children are non-existent. The total hi stor y 

of this cave reveals that the mother is unable and unwilling t o change or to give priority to the 

needs for,. safety and adequate care for her children.  She was given numerous opportunities to 

demonstr, le she would work to be able to provide the necessary basic needs for her children and 

consisten'ly failed to do so, The Agency has provided Clear and convincing evidence supporting 

the: Termn; cation ofA.A.C's parental rights to A.L.V. and A.J.R. pursuant to 23 Pa. C.S.A. §2511(a)

CONCLUSION 

her to re!nedy the conditions which led to the removal and placement of AI N, and A.J.R. The 

mother 11as shown that she cannot or will not remedy the conditions which led to the removal of 

her child rren. A.XC, did not evidence any desire or ability to place her children's safety and well-

being above her dangerous lifestyle. There is no parental bond between mother and children. The 

best interests of A.L.V. and A.J.R. are best served by termination. It is requested that the Superior 

Court aft .inn this Court's Decree terminating the Appellant/mother's parental rights.
