2 

judicial  officer,  Sheriff’s  deputy,  police  officer,  constable,  building

in,  or  complete  necessary  essential  court 
business/functions during the judicial emergency. 
 

 

•  Only  persons  with  essential  court  business  are  guaranteed  admission

•  Sheriff’s  deputies,  police,  constables,  and  building  security  shall  have 
the  authority  to  enforce  all  of  the  conditions  in  this  section.    Persons 
who are not compliant with this order, will be required to leave the court

I.  Methods for Conducting Proceedings 

 

•  Whenever  appropriate  and  feasible,  and  as  directed  by  the  President 
Judge, the Administrative Judges of the Divisions, and the District Court 
Administrator,  court  proceedings  shall  be  conducted  by  Advanced 
Communication Technology (ACT), primarily through Microsoft Teams, 
pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings issued by the Court.  
Other audio or teleconference methods may be employed, pursuant to 
the protocol for teleconference hearings issued by the Court, with the 
approval of the Administrative Judges.  See Protocol for Teleconference 
Hearings found on the Fifth Judicial District website. 
 

3 

 

  I

 

•  Remote  matters,  conducted  through  Advanced  Communication  on 
Technology  shall  be  conducted  with  the  same  decorum  as  in-person 
matters. 
 

•  When it is determined that conducting court proceedings through ACT 
is not appropriate or feasible, court hearings and proceedings shall be 
conducted utilizing protocols and policies relating to the use of masks or 
other  personal  protective  equipment,  social  distancing,  and  other 
guidance specified in Section II of this Order. 
 

•  Any administrative order, policy, or protocol issued by an Administrative 
Judge requiring certain proceedings to be conducted through ACT shall 
be followed.  Any exceptions to such an administrative order, policy, or 
protocol must be approved by the Administrative Judge of the Division. 

•  In order to prevent overcrowding, court appearances and hearing times 
shall  be  staggered,  and  the  Administrative  Judges  may  require  that 
scheduling of cases be centralized in each division. 
 

•  Attorneys are strongly encouraged to bring only essential witnesses and 
persons  to  in-person  court  proceedings.    Attorneys  should  encourage 
their clients to refrain from having non-participants accompany them to 
court proceedings. 
 

•  When  a  court  reporter  or  other  approved  form  of  recording  court 
proceedings  is  unavailable,  alternative  forms  of  recording  shall  be 
permitted. 
 

•  All persons participating in a court proceeding, including but not limited 
to,  judges  and  judicial  officers,  attorneys,  court  employees,  court 
reporters,  witnesses,  and  spectators,  are  required  to  wear  a  mask  or 
face  covering  for  the  entire  proceeding.    The  judge  or  judicial  officer 
may permit a person to temporarily remove the mask to take testimony 
or  where  the  presence  of  a  mask  would  affect  the  ability  to  judge 
credibility, provided that the requirements for social distancing, and in 
the  case  of  matter  in  the  Criminal  Division,  the  attached  Criminal 
Division Procedures (as may be subsequently amended and posted on 

4 

 

 

the  website  of  the  Fifth  Judicial  District)  are  followed.    In  such  cases, 
the person will be required to wear a face shield.  The Court shall make 
every  effort  to  minimize  the  number  of  people  present  for  in-person 
court proceedings, including allowing particular attorneys or witnesses 
to appear remotely. 

•  Orders prohibiting and limiting the use of cellular phones in courtrooms 
and court facilities remain in effect.  However, due to the requirements 
for  social  distancing,  an  attorney  may  use  a  cellular  telephone  to 
communicate with a client or a witness while outside of the courtroom. 
An attorney may use a cellular telephone to summon witnesses waiting 
in another location, to the courtroom; or for such other purpose deemed 
appropriate  by  the  judge  or  judicial  officer  presiding  over  the  court 
proceeding.   

  The taking of photographs or the recording of any proceeding is strictly 
prohibited.    Anyone  violating  this  provision  shall  forfeit  their  cellular 
phone or device and shall be subject to contempt proceedings or other 
sanctions. 

  •

 

 

•  Taking the testimony of witnesses through ACT is strongly encouraged.  
However,  when  a  witness  must  testify  in  person  in  a  courtroom,  the 
witness may be required to wait in another location until such time as 
the  court  is  prepared  to  take  the  testimony  of  the  witness.    Upon 
conclusion  of  the  testimony,  the  witness  shall  be  excused  from  the 
courtroom and shall leave the court facility unless the judge or judicial 
officer determines that there is a reason that the witness must remain 
in the court facility.   

•  News media may be permitted into a courtroom, if social distancing can 
be  maintained.    The  court  may  designate  certain  seats  for  the  news 
media,  however,  seats  for  attorneys,  parties  to  the  proceedings  and 
essential court staff take priority over seats for the news media. 

•  Sidebar conferences are prohibited until further order of court.

III.  Time Calculations and Deadlines  

 

 

•  Except  as  otherwise  set  forth  in  this  Order,  the  suspension  of  time 
calculations due to the judicial emergency that began on March 16, 2020 
ended at the end of the day on June 1, 2020. 
 

•  Time  calculations  and  deadlines  were  suspended  during  the  judicial 
emergency so that they did not continue to run during that time. The 
suspension  began  on  March  16,  2020  and  continued  through  June  1, 
2020–or for 78 days.  New deadlines shall be calculated by adding the 
time period of the suspension (days during which time calculations were 
suspended  due  to  the  judicial  emergency  as  applied  to  the  particular 
time  calculation)  to  the  original  deadline.  The  period  of  suspension 
caused  by  the  judicial  emergency  added  on  to  the  deadline  shall  only 
include that period of the suspension during which the particular time 
calculation would have otherwise been running.   
 

•  For example, if an original 30-day deadline fell on March 19, 2020, and 
the  period  of  suspension  under  the  judicial  emergency  was  78  days 
(March 16th through June 1st), the new deadline would be June 5, 2020 
(78  days  after  March  19th).    In  this  example,  the  particular  time 
calculation stopped running during the entire 78-day suspension when 
it would have otherwise been running. If, however, a deadline expired 
before the judicial emergency began, then that deadline would not be 
extended by the judicial emergency.    
 

•  The period of suspension caused by the judicial emergency added on to 
the  deadline  shall  only  include  that  period  of  the  suspension  during 
which  the  particular  time  calculation  would  have  otherwise  been 
running.  For example, if a 20-day time period begins running on May 
27, 2020, when a complaint is served, then the original 20-day deadline 
would  be  June  16,  2020.  The  period  during  which  this  particular  time 
calculation would be suspended by the judicial emergency would be 6 
days (from May 27th through June 1st) and the new deadline would be 
June 22, 2020 (6 days after June 16, 2020).  Stated differently, if a 20-
day time period begins running on May 27, 2020, when a complaint is 
served upon the defendant, the parties start counting the 20-day time 

 

6 

period  from  June  2,  2020,  (i.e.  June  3rd  is  day  one),  and  the  new 
deadline is again June 22, 2020. 
 

•  If, however, the particular time calculation did not start to run until after 
June 1, 2020, then the deadline would not be extended as it would be 
unaffected  by  the  suspension.    For  example,  if  a  20-day  time  period 
begins  running  on  June  3,  2020  when  a  complaint  is  served  then  the 
original 20-day deadline of June 23, 2020 would not be extended.  

•  Postponements  or  continuances  resulting  from  the  judicial  emergency 
shall be considered court postponements and shall constitute excludable 
time, subject to constitutional limitations for purposes of the application 
of Rule 600.  See Commonwealth v. Bradford, 46 A.3d 693 (Pa. 2012) 
and Commonwealth v. Mills, 162 A. 3d 323 (Pa. 2017).   

•  The  suspension  of  Rule  600,  subject  to  constitutional  limitations,  as 
indicated in this Court’s previous Emergency Operations Orders, began 
on  March  16,  2020  and  will  continue  through  December  31,  2020, 
subject to further order of court.   
 

•  Jury  trials  in  both  the  Civil  and  Criminal  Divisions  remain  suspended 

until further Order of Court.   

•  Attorneys  and  litigants  shall  not  use  the  judicial  emergency  to  secure 
strategic  advantage  in  litigation,  including  by  dilatory  conduct.  
Individual judges may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a 
failure to meet a deadline was not directly the result of or affected by 
the  judicial  emergency,  (such  as  in  routine  discovery  matters)  and 
whether  the  deadline  should  have  been  met  during  the  judicial 
emergency.  The judge may then take any action deemed appropriate 
to address the situation. 

V.  Transportation, Signatures, Fingerprinting, and Publication 

 

•  There will be no identification process at time of arrest, unless processed 
through  the  Allegheny  County  Jail.  Defendants  will  be  assigned  a 
fingerprint appointment for a later date.

  I

 

•  Until further Order of Court: 

 

o  No inmates will be transported from the Allegheny County Jail or 

a state correctional facility for preliminary hearings. 

o  Juveniles will not be transported from Shuman Detention Center 
or Hartman Shelter for court hearings, unless the judge orders the 
juvenile to appear in court. 

o  Where the participation of the inmate or juvenile is required at a 
court  hearing,  Advanced  Communication  Technology  shall  be 
considered before issuing the order to transport. 

o  All  juveniles  or  inmates  who  are  being  transported  shall  wear  a 

mask.  

o  The  Sheriff’s  deputies  may  refuse  to  transport  an  inmate  or 
juvenile who is visibly ill, who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-
19, or who refuses to wear a mask, and shall immediately notify 
the assigned judge. 

•  Alternative methods of signing, delivery, and service of court documents 
and  orders  shall  be  permitted.    This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, 
facsimile  signatures,  electronic  signatures,  proxy  signatures,  and 
designated court employees authorized to sign on behalf of a judge after 
the judge has reviewed and approved the document for signature.  Pro 
se  litigants  completing  forms  at  Pittsburgh  Municipal  Court  may 
authorize court employees to sign documents, when necessary, for the 
safety of the litigants and court employees. Under such circumstances, 
the court employee will sign his/her name to the document indicating 
that  the  litigant  has  reviewed  the  document  and  that  all  of  the 
information  contained  therein  was  provided  by  the  litigant.    If  an 
employee must sign for a pro se litigant, he/she will do so in a manner 
allowing the litigant to see the employee sign the document.     
 

•  In  the  interest  of  public  health,  the  Pittsburgh  Legal  Journal  shall  be 
published  as  an  electronic  PDF  through  the  duration  of  the  judicial 
emergency in the Fifth Judicial District.  During the judicial emergency, 
proofs  of  publication  produced  by  the  Pittsburgh  Legal  Journal  can  be 
properly verified and signed by a notary public only, instead of a notary 
public and an affiant as is typically required.  Proofs of publication may 

8 

 

 

be mailed or emailed to relevant parties. Records of all electronic proofs 
of publication and email correspondence shall be preserved. 
 
Civil Division 
 

V. 

•  Where  appropriate  and  feasible,  Civil  Division  proceedings  shall  be 
conducted by Advanced Communication Technology, primarily through 
Microsoft Teams, pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings 
issued  by  the  Court.    Other  audio  or  teleconference  methods  may  be 
employed, pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings issued 
by  the  Court,  with  the  approval  of  the  Administrative  Judges.    See 
Protocol for Teleconference Hearings posted on the Fifth Judicial District 
website. 
 

•  All published trial lists are temporarily suspended pending further Order 

of Court.  
 

•  Non-jury trials commenced in June 2020.  Non-jury trials shall continue 
to be conducted pursuant to the protocols outlined in this Order.  Such 
non-jury  trials  shall  be  identified  by  the  Court  and  specially  listed  for 
non-jury  trial  by  separate  Order(s)  of  Court.    Where  appropriate  and 
possible,  such  non-jury  trials  shall  be  conducted  using  Advanced 
Communication  Technology  (ACT).    When  it  is  not  appropriate  and 
possible to use ACT for non-jury trials, all parties, lawyers, witnesses, 
and  persons  participating  in  the  trial  must  follow  the  Fifth  Judicial 
District’s  protocols  and  policies  relating  to  the  use  of  masks  or  other 
personal  protective  equipment,  social  distancing,  and  other  guidance 
specified in Section II of this Order. 
 

•  Jury trials shall commence on a limited basis and only where the Court 
enters an Order specifically scheduling a jury trial.  Parties with cases 
on previously published trial lists may jointly, with written consent by 
all parties involved in the litigation, submit consented-to motions to the 
Calendar  Control  Judge  requesting  that  their  case  be  scheduled  to  be 
tried before a jury.

remotely through the use of Advanced Communication Technology:  

 

Calendar Control Motions,  
Housing Court Motions, 
Discovery Motions, 
General Motions (contested and uncontested),

for failure to pay rent, or due to an expired lease are scheduled to expire

ORDER OF COURT 
 

AND  NOW,  this  31st  day  of  August  2020,  pursuant  to  Pa.R.J.A.  No. 

1952(B)(2),  this  Court  having  declared  a  judicial  emergency  in  the  Fifth 

Judicial District of Pennsylvania through December 31, 2020, and recognizing 

that  rent  assistance  through  the  CARES  Rent  Relief  Program  and  other 

programs is available for landlords and tenants in Allegheny County and that 

landlords  and  tenants  may  require  time  to  apply  for  such  assistance  and 

additional time for their applications to be processed, the following is hereby 

ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED. 

1.  Effective September 1, 2020, all residential landlord tenant actions will 
be  accepted  for  filing  within  the  Fifth  Judicial  District  pursuant  to  the 
applicable statutes and rules governing those actions. 

2.  Initial hearing dates for residential landlord tenant actions filed at the 
Magisterial  District  Courts  where  the  action  is  based  solely  on  non-
payment  of  rent  shall  be  scheduled  at  the  latest  available  landlord 
tenant  court  date  consistent  with  Pa.R.C.P.M.D.J.  504  and  may  be 
scheduled up to seven (7) days beyond the time limit set forth in Rule 
504, if the Magisterial District Judge finds it necessary due to the volume 
of cases already scheduled. 

3.  On  such  cases,  if  on  or  before  the  initial  hearing  date,  the  tenant 
provides an affidavit or testifies under oath affirming that the tenant has 
submitted or will submit an application for rental assistance under the 
CARES  Rent  Relief  Program  or  any  of  the  other  available  rental 
assistance programs, the initial hearing date shall be used to conduct a 
status conference rather than a hearing. During this status conference, 
the CARES Rent Relief Program or other program shall be considered by 
the  parties  who  shall  determine  if  they  will  move  forward  with  an 
application.

4.  If both parties agree to move forward with an application through the 
CARES  Rent  Relief  Program  or  other  available  rental  assistance 
program, the hearing shall be continued to allow for sufficient time for 
the  application  to  be  processed  as  agreed  to  by  the  parties  and  the 
Magisterial  District  Judge.    Multiple  continuances  may  be  granted  so 
there is sufficient time for the application to be processed and the relief 
to be provided. A hearing shall not occur until the application has either 
been granted, denied or withdrawn. 
 

5.  If, during the status conference, the parties do not both agree to move 
forward with an application, the case may be postponed to a new date 
for a hearing on the matter or the Magisterial District Judge may, in his 
or her discretion, continue the hearing to allow for an application to be 
made and processed.   
 

6.  The  procedures  in  paragraphs  2  through  5  above  apply  only  to 
residential  landlord  tenant  actions  at  the  Magisterial  District  Courts 
where the action is based solely on non-payment of rent.

symptoms or awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test.  Arrangements shall 
be  made  for  the  person  to  participate  remotely  or  the  matter  shall  be 
postponed. 

Taking  the  testimony  of  witnesses  through  Microsoft  Teams  is  strongly 
encouraged.    However,  when  a  witness  must  testify  in  person  in  a 
courtroom,  attorneys  will  be  responsible  for  management  of  their 
witnesses.  

Witnesses may be required to wait in designated areas of the Courthouse, 
outside  the  Courthouse  or  elsewhere  so  that  social  distancing  may  be 
maintained and  to reduce the amount of people in the courtroom at any 
time. 

Witnesses who wait in the hallways may not congregate and must socially 
distance.   

Attorneys  shall  inform  the  Court  of  the  status  and  location  of  their 
witnesses prior to the start of a proceeding so that the attorneys may be 
given  adequate  time  to  notify  and  call  each  witness  to  testify.    Upon 
conclusion  of  the  testimony,  the  witness  shall  be  excused  from  the 
courtroom  and  shall  leave  the  court  facility  unless  the  judge  or  judicial 
officer determines that there is a reason that the witness must remain in 
the court facility. 

The  taking  of  photographs  or  the  recording  of  any  proceeding  is  strictly 
prohibited.  Anyone violating this provision shall forfeit their cellular phone 
or device and shall be subject to contempt proceedings or other sanctions.  
Notwithstanding, with the permission of the presiding judge, an attorney 
may  use  a  cellular  telephone  to  summon  a  witness  waiting  in  another 
location or for such other purpose authorized by the judge. When a judge 
is on the bench, the attorney shall first request permission from the judge.

f a case will be proceeding to trial, the parties are encouraged to stipulate to 
any evidence or testimony, where possible, to avoid the need for witnesses to 
be  called  to  testify.  If  stipulations  may  be  furthered  by  a  party  making  a 
potential  witness  available  via  conference  call  with  all  counsel,  counsel  are 
encouraged  to  utilize  this  method  or  other  similar  opportunities  to  further 
discussions  regarding  possible  stipulations.  Where  stipulations  cannot  be 
reached  regarding  the  testimony  of  a  witness,  the  parties  should  discuss 
whether any witnesses might be permitted to testify via video. 

n a matter which is to proceed remotely, exhibits should be exchanged via 
email  between the  parties at least 24  hours prior to  the  proceeding, with  a 
copy to court staff. If a  party  believes that circumstances exist  that a  prior 
exchange of a particular exhibit should not occur, the issue should be brought 
to the Court’s attention though the Case Status Conference process.    

hen  a  defense  attorney  has  been  unable  to  contact  the  defendant,  the 
Prosecutor shall not bring in any witnesses but shall have them available by 
phone  in  the  event  that  a  previously  “unreachable”  defendant  appears  and 
determines to enter a guilty plea. 

f the defendant then fails to appear on their scheduled court date, a warrant 
shall be issued.  

f  the  defendant  does  appear  on  their  scheduled  date,  the  courtroom  staff 
should  direct  the  defendant  to  the  location  previously  supplied  by  defense 
counsel  so  that  the  defendant  can  make  contact  with  defense  counsel.  The
