“The Army has enriched my life. The first 
big thing the Army teaches you is about 
doing things for more than just yourself. 
You think of others. There’s no place for 
ego. Leadership comes from that. You have 
the back of your fellow soldiers and they 
have yours. As a judge, you continue to 
work as a team with the staff, the parties, 
attorneys and witnesses to achieve justice. 
It is a wonderful thing if it works right 
and just like the Army, justice is not 
about me being the judge, it is about being 
a member of a team. A judge is like a high-
ranking officer and that judge has to guide 
people through a challenge. It is about 
ensuring a fair process and a fair result.”

true. As a child, I met an uncle of 
mine who was a Marine and his walk, 
talk and bearing was different; he 
moved with confidence and took life 
in stride. The training I received as 
a Marine helped me to realize that 
the human body is made to do so much 
more than we think and that groups of 
hard-charging Americans infused with 
esprit de corps, and God’s blessing, 
can conquer any enemy. Civilian world 
translation: there is no problem too 
big to handle.”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
