with the family finding requirements pursuant to 67 Pa.C.S. §§ [3101] 7501 et 
seq.   

  
See 67 Pa.C.S.  §  [3101]  7501 for legislative  intent  regarding family  finding  and 

promotion of kinship care.   

amily finding is required for every child when a child is accepted for services by 
the county agency.  See 67 Pa.C.S. § [3103] 7503.  It is best practice to find as many kin 
as possible for each child.  These kin may help with care or support for the child.  The 
county agency should ask the guardian, the child, and siblings about relatives or other 
adults in the child’s life, including key supporters of the child or guardians.

Permanency planning is a concept whereby children are not relegated to the limbo 
 
of spending their childhood in foster homes, but instead, dedicated effort is made by the 
court and the county agency to rehabilitate and reunite the family in a reasonable time, 
and failing in this, to free the child for adoption.  In re M.B., 674 A.2d 702, 704 (Pa. Super.  
1996) (quoting In re Quick, 559 A.2d 42 (Pa. 1989)).   
 

To the extent practicable, the judge or juvenile court hearing officer who presided 
over the adjudicatory and original dispositional hearing for a child should preside over the 
permanency hearing for the same child.  

ursuant to [paragraph (A)] subdivision (a), courts are to conduct a permanency 
hearing  every  six  months.    Courts  are  strongly  encouraged  to  conduct  more  frequent 
permanency hearings, such as every three months, when possible. 

  
The court may schedule a three-month hearing or conference.  At the three-month 
hearing,  the  court  should  ensure  that:  1)  services  ordered  at  the  dispositional  hearing 
pursuant to Rule 1512 are put into place by the county agency; 2) the guardian who is 
the  subject  of  the  petition  is  given  access  to  the  services  ordered;  3)  the  guardian  is 
cooperating with the court-ordered services; and 4) a concurrent plan is developed if the 
primary plan may not be achieved. 

 three-month hearing or conference is considered best practice for dependency 
cases and is highly recommended.  The court should not wait until six months has elapsed 
to  determine  if  the  case  is  progressing.    Time  to  achieve  permanency  is  critical  in 
dependency cases.  In order to seek reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security 
Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq., a full permanency hearing is to be conducted every six 
months,  including  required  findings  and  conclusions  of  law  on  the  record  pursuant  to 
[paragraph (D)] subdivision (d). 

n addition to the permanency hearing contemplated by this rule, courts may also 
conduct  additional  and/or  more  frequent  intermittent  review  hearings  or  status 
conferences that  address  specific issues  based  on  the  circumstances  of the  case  and 
assist the court in ensuring timely permanency. 

very child should have a concurrent plan, which is a secondary plan to be pursued 
if the primary permanency plan for the child cannot be achieved.  See [Comment to Rule 
1512] Pa.R.J.C.P. 1512, Comment.  For example, the primary plan may be reunification 
with the guardian.  If the guardian does not substantially comply with the requirements of 
the  court-ordered  services,  subsidized  legal  guardianship  may  be  utilized  as  the 
concurrent plan.  Because of time requirements, the concurrent plan is to be in place so 
that permanency may be achieved in a timely manner.

[Paragraph  (D)(1)(c)]  Subdivision  (d)(1)(iii)  is  intended  to  provide  adequate 
notice and the opportunity to be heard when a goal is being changed from reunification.  
If  the  court  intends  to  change  the  child’s  goal  from  reunification  without  a  prior  notice 
provided  by  a  party  pursuant  to  Rule  1601(B),  then  the  court  shall  direct  the  county 
agency to provide such notice in accordance with Rule 1601(B). 

ursuant  to  [paragraph  (D)(1)(h)]  subdivision  (d)(1)(viii),  the  court  is  to 
determine whether the county agency has reasonably satisfied the requirements of Rule 
1149 regarding family finding, including the location and engagement of relatives and kin 
at least every six months, prior to each permanency hearing.  If the county agency has 
failed to meet the diligent family finding efforts requirements of Rule 1149, the court is to 
utilize its powers to enforce this legislative mandate.  See 67 Pa.C.S. §§ [1301] 7501 et 
seq.    See  also  [Rules]  Pa.R.J.C.P.  1210(D)(8),  1242(E)(3),  1409(C),  1609(D),  and 
1611(C), and Comments to [Rules] Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1408, 1409, 1512, 1514, 1515, 
1609, and 1611.   

hen making its determination for reasonable efforts made by the county agency, 
the  court  is  to  consider  family  finding.    See  also  [Rules]  Pa.R.J.C.P.  1240(B)(6), 
[1242(C)(2)  &  (3)(b)  &  (c)]  1242(C)(2),  (C)(3)(b)-(c),  and  1330(B)(6),  and  Comments 
to [Rules] Pa.R.J.C.P. 1242, 1330, 1409, 1515, 1609, and 1611 for reasonable efforts 
determinations. 

ee  42  U.S.C.  §  675(5)(A)-(I)  and  67  Pa.C.S.  §  7505  for  development  of  a 

transition plan pursuant to [paragraph (D)(1)(k)] subdivision (d)(1)(xi).   

ursuant to [paragraph (D)(1)(o)] subdivision (d)(1)(xv), the county agency is to 
testify  and  enter evidence  into  the  record on  how  it  took  sufficient steps  to ensure  the 
caregiver is exercising the reasonable and prudent parent standard.  For the definition of 
“caregiver” and the “reasonable and prudent parent standard,” see Rule 1120.  Pursuant 
to [paragraph (D)(1)(p)] subdivision (d)(1)(xvi), when documenting its steps taken, the 
county  agency  is  to  include  how  it  consulted  with  the  child  in  an  age-appropriate  or 
developmentally-appropriate manner about the opportunities of the child to participate in 
activities.    For  the  definition  of  “age-appropriate  or  developmentally-appropriate,”  see 
Rule 1120.  These additions have been made to help dependent children have a sense 
of normalcy in their lives.  These children should be able to participate in extracurricular, 
enrichment, cultural, and social activities without having to consult caseworkers and ask 
the court’s permission many days prior to the event.  See also Preventing Sex Trafficking 
and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183), 42 U.S.C. §§ 675 and 675a (2014). 

ursuant  to  [paragraph  (D)(2)]  subdivision  (d)(2),  there  are  additional 
considerations, inquiries, and findings when the court conducts a permanency hearing for 
a child, who is [sixteen] 18 years of age or older and has a permanency plan of APPLA.  
APPLA should only be utilized as a permanency plan when all other alternatives have

been  exhausted.    Even  after  exhaustive  efforts  have  been  made,  the  county  agency 
should identify at least [one] two supportive adults to be involved in the life of the child.  
Diligent  efforts  to  search  for  relatives,  guardians,  adoptive  parents,  or  kin  are  to  be 
utilized.  [See] See Rule 1149 on family finding.  Independent living services should also 
be addressed.  Under [paragraph (D)(2)(a)(i)(B)] subdivision (d)(2)(i)(A)(II), a fit and 
willing relative may include adult siblings.  

    
Pursuant to [paragraph (D)(2)(b)] subdivision (d)(2)(ii), the court is to engage 
the  child  in  conversation  to  ascertain  the  child’s  desired  permanency  outcome.    The 
conversation is to be between the child and the court, not the guardian ad litem answering 
for the child.   

fter all the requirements of [paragraph (D)(1) and (D)(2)(a) and (b)] subdivision 
(d)(1) and (d)(2)(i)-(ii) have been made, the court is to state in open court on the record 
the specific reasons why APPLA continues to be the best permanency plan for the child, 
the compelling reasons why it continues not to be in the best interests of the child to return 
home or be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative, and 
the full names of at least [one] two identified supportive adults with whom the child has 
significant  connections.    See  [paragraph  (D)(2)(c)]  subdivision  (d)(2)(iii).    The 
standards of this rule make choosing the plan of APPLA difficult to ensure  that it is the 
last alternative available for the child.  Additionally, this rule requires the court to state its 
finding in open court on the record.  If the court takes a case under advisement, it is to 
continue the hearing until it is ready to make these findings.  The time requirements of 
the Rules are to be followed when taking a case under advisement.   

Pursuant to paragraph (D)(3), a “petition to terminate parental rights” is a 
term of art used pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511 and Pa. O.C. Rule 15.4 to describe 
the  motion  terminating  parental  rights.    This  does  not  refer  to  the  “petition”  as 
defined  in  Pa.R.J.C.P.  1120.]    Concerning  subdivision  (d)(3),  a  petition  for 
involuntary termination of parental rights is authorized by 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 2511-2514 
and proceeds in accordance with Chapter 15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Orphans’ 
Court Procedure.     

he court is to move expeditiously towards permanency.  A goal change motion 

may be filed at any time. 

 President Judge may allow Common Pleas Judges to “wear multiple hats” during 
a  proceeding  by  conducting  a  combined  hearing  on  dependency  and  Orphans’  Court 
matters.  See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(i); see also In re Adoption of S.E.G., 901 A.2d 1017 (Pa. 
2006),  where  involuntary  termination  occurred  prior  to  a  goal  change  by  the  county 
agency.

At the hearing, the court shall review the transition plan for the child. 
If  the  court  is  not  satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  [paragraph 
(E)(2)]  subdivision  (e)(2)  have  been  met,  a  subsequent  hearing 
shall be scheduled. 

The  court  shall  not  terminate  its  supervision  of  the  child  without 
approving  an  appropriate  transition  plan,  unless  the  child,  after  an 
appropriate transition plan has been offered, is unwilling to consent 
to the supervision and the court determines termination is warranted.

[(F)] (f)   Cessation  of  [services]  Services.   When  all  of  the  above  listed 
requirements  have  been  met,  the  court  may  discharge  the  child  from  its 
supervision and close the case. 

Comment:    For  procedures  on  motions,  see  Rule  1344.    For  procedures  on  the 
dispositional order, see Rule 1515. 

For guidelines under [paragraph (A)] subdivision (a), see 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301(b) 

[&] and 6351(f.1).

Pursuant to [paragraph (A)(8)] subdivision (a)(8), if a child has been adjudicated 
    
delinquent, the court may terminate court supervision unless dependency is necessary 
for placement.  In re Deanna S., [422 Pa. Super. 439,] 619 A.2d 758 (Pa. Super. 1993).  
The court may also decide to retain dependency jurisdiction regardless of the delinquency 
adjudication because the child still needs dependency services. 

    
If dependency issues have not been resolved, the case should be kept open and 
services  ordered.    The  court  should  ensure  that  services  are  not  discontinued  solely 
because  the  child  was  adjudicated  delinquent.    The  county  agency  and  the  juvenile 
probation are to collaborate on the case and resolve all outstanding issues.  If a child is 
in a delinquency placement, the court is to ensure that the county agency and the juvenile 
probation office have collaborated to ensure appropriate services are in place. 

For  procedures  on  emancipation  pursuant  to  [paragraph  (A)(9)]  subdivision 
    
(a)(9), see Berks County Children and Youth Services v. Rowan, [428 Pa. Super. 448,] 
631 A.2d 615 (Pa. Super. 1993).  See also[,] 22 Pa. Code § 11.11, 55 Pa. Code § 145.62. 

Pursuant to [paragraph (A)(10)] subdivision (a)(10), a child who was adjudicated 
    
dependent prior to reaching the age of [eighteen] 18 and who, while engaged in a course 
of  instruction  or treatment,  requests the  court to  retain  jurisdiction  until the  course  has 
been  completed,  may  remain  in  the  course  of  instruction  or  treatment  until  the  age  of 
[twenty-one]  21.    42  Pa.C.S.  §  6302.    See  also[,]  55  Pa.  Code  §§  3103.5  [&]  and 
3130.87; In re S.J., 906 A.2d 547 (Pa. Super. [Ct.] 2006). 

The court may not terminate jurisdiction solely because the dependent child is a 

    
runaway.  In re Deanna S., [422 Pa. Super. 439,] 619 A.2d 758 (Pa. Super. 1993). 

[A]  Pursuant  to  subdivision  (b),  a  child  whose  non-custodial  parent  is  ready, 
    
willing, and able to provide adequate care for the child may not be found dependent.  See 
In re M.L., [562 Pa. 646,] 757 A.2d 849 (Pa. 2000).  [See paragraph (B).  Paragraph 
(B)] Subdivision (b) does not apply to resumption of jurisdiction cases. 

    
[Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a)(2.1), a] A court may transfer permanent legal 
custody to a person found by the court to be qualified to receive and care for the child.  
See 42 Pa.C.S. § 6351(a)(2.1).  See also Justin S., [375 Pa.Super. 88,] 543 A.2d 1192 
(Pa. Super. 1988).   

Pursuant to [paragraph (E)(2)] subdivision (e)(2), the county agency is to assist 
   
the child and provide all the support necessary in developing a transition plan.   See 42 
U.S.C. § 675(5)(A)-(H); 67 Pa.C.S. § 7505. 

 

27 

Pursuant  to  [paragraph  (E)(3)]  subdivision  (e)(3),  the  court  is  to  approve  a 
    
transition plan that is suitable for the child and that has been personalized at the direction 
of the child. 

    
If the court has resumed jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 1635, a new transition plan 
is  to  be  developed  for  the  child.    Before  the  court  can  terminate  supervision,  the 
requirements  of  [paragraph  (E)]  subdivision  (e)  are  to  be  followed.    In  no  case  is  a 
juvenile  over  [twenty-one]  21  to  remain  under  juvenile  court  supervision.    See [Rule] 
Pa.R.J.C.P. 1635(E).  [See also] See also Rule 1635(E) for termination of juvenile court 
jurisdiction if the court denies the motion for resumption of jurisdiction.
