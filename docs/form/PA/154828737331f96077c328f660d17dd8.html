      <pre>FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA  
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF PHILADELPHIA COUNTY  
 
No. 42 of 2020 
 
In re: Commerce Court Temporary Financial Monitor Program 

 

ORDER 
 

AND NOW, this  22nd    day of June, 2020, consistent with the goals of the Commerce 

Court, which hears, inter alia, disputes between or among two or more business entities and 
handles dissolution and liquidation of business entities, the court takes judicial notice that the COVID-
19 pandemic has caused significant economic harm to local for-profit businesses and non-profit 
institutions, many of which were forced to close for lengthy periods of time and have been unable to 
generate sufficient income to pay their debts or retain their staff, and it appears that the current 
economic climate threatens their ability to operate in the future, it is hereby ORDERED and 
DECREED that, in order to provide assistance to keep local enterprises operational, a Commerce 
Court Temporary Financial Monitor Program (hereinafter the “Monitor Program”) shall be created 
within the First Judicial District’s Commerce Court under the general supervision of the Commerce 
Court Supervising Judge as follows:  

1.  Establishment and Eligibility of the Monitor Program. 

A.  The Commerce Court Supervising Judge, upon consultation with the Administrative 
Judge of the Trial Division, members of the bar, and other stakeholders, shall adopt 
appropriate case management orders and other protocols for the implementation of 
the Monitor Program in accordance with the Administrative Orders governing the 
Commerce Court and other applicable rules of court. 

.  Any for-profit or non-profit entity, including a sole proprietorship, is eligible to 

participate in the Monitor Program if its principal place of business is located in 
Philadelphia County and it ceased to conduct a substantial portion of its operations 
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a loss of revenue and causing the entity to 
be unable to pay its usual and customary costs and expenses coming due  in  the 
ordinary course on and after March 1, 2020.  Entities whose defaults or failure to 
pay costs and expenses occurred on or before February 29, 2020, are generally 
ineligible to participate, unless otherwise determined by the court upon Petition.  

 

2.  Assignment to the Monitor Program. 

A case is commenced and will be assigned to the Monitor Program when an eligible 
entity files a Petition to Enjoin Collection Activities and Appoint a Temporary Financial  
Monitor (hereinafter the “Petition”).  
 

3.  Information to be included in the Petition..  

The petitioning entity must include in, or as exhibits to, the Petition financial statement(s) 
identifying pre- and post- COVID assets, revenues, costs, and expenses, along with 
detailed information regarding the entity’s creditors and the amounts owed to each of 
them.  Exhibits containing financial information may be filed under seal, but they will be 
available for viewing by creditors and the Temporary Financial Monitor.  The Petition 
must be filed as a public document. 

 

 

  B

Court Review and Assignment of Temporary Financial Monitor. 
The Petition shall be assigned to the Commerce Court Supervising Judge or his designee, 
who may issue one or more orders: directing the filing of Response(s) to the Petition by 
creditors and other interested parties; appointing a legal or accounting professional to act 
as a Temporary Financial Monitor; scheduling meetings or conferences with creditors; 
enjoining creditors from engaging in any collection activities against the petitioning 
entity and its assets; requiring the entity to post a nominal bond; and directing such other 
actions as the court, sitting in equity, deems appropriate. 

.  Duties and Obligations of Temporary Financial Monitor. 

The Temporary Financial Monitor shall be responsible for evaluating the financial 
information provided by the petitioning entity and, upon consultation with the entity and 
its creditors, shall prepare a proposed Operating Plan to enable the entity to resume 
and/or continue operations while paying off its accumulated debts. The Operating Plan 
will be shared with creditors and other interested parties and submitted to the court for 
approval. The Temporary Financial Monitor shall provide periodic reports, as well as any 
revised Operating Plans, as directed by the court. 
 

6.  Termination or Conclusion of Assignment of Temporary Financial Monitor 

The Temporary Financial Monitor will be discharged within one year from the date of 
appointment, unless otherwise ordered by the court.  

s required by Pa.R.J.A. 103(d), this Administrative Order and the proposed local rule were submitted to the Supreme 
Court of Pennsylvania Civil Procedural Rules Committee for review and written notification has been received from 
the Rules Committee certifying that the proposed local rule is not inconsistent with any general rule of the Supreme 
Court. This Administrative Order and the attached local rule shall be filed with the Office of Judicial Records (formerly 
the Prothonotary, Clerk of Courts and Clerk of Quarter Sessions) in a docket maintained for Administrative Orders 
issued by the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. As required by Pa.R.J.A. 103(d)(5)(ii), two certified copies of 
this Administrative Order and the attached local rule, as well as one copy of the Administrative Order and local rule 
shall be distributed to the Legislative Reference Bureau on a computer diskette for publication in the Pennsylvania 
Bulletin. As required by Pa.R.J.A. 103(d)(6) one certified copy of this Administrative Order and local rule shall be 
filed with the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, shall be published on the website of  the First Judicial 
District at http://courts.phila.gov, and shall be incorporated in the compiled set of local rules no later than 30 days 
following publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. Copies of the Administrative Order and local rules shall also be 
published  in  The  Legal  Intelligencer  and  will  be  submitted  to  American  Lawyer  Media,  Jenkins  Memorial  Law 
Library, and the Law Library for the First Judicial District.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
