writer when final, but in appropriate cases it may be a briefer opinion recom-
mended by the writer to be handed down per curiam. Except in the case of adop-
tion of the reasoning in the opinion of the trial court, or where the appeal is mer-
itless, the opinion shall state, at least summarily, the nature of the case, the

inform the writer of (1) their agreement or disagreement with the opinion and
order in accordance with these rules, together with any suggestions which they
may desire to make with respect to the draft opinion, and (2) any disagreement
as to the writer’s recommendation concerning reporting, in accordance with

poses a result different from the tentative conference vote, and (2) when a pro-
posed panel decision would overrule a previous panel decision of this Court. The
other Judges shall respond to the opinion-writing Judge within fifteen days. If no
response is received in that time, the opinion-writing Judge shall consider nonre-
sponse as indicating that each Judge not responding is willing to have the opin-

§ 69.253. Decisions; Concurrences and Dissents.

If a Judge on the Court en banc or the panel before which a case was argued,
or to which it was submitted, responds by stating an intention to write a concur-
ring opinion or a dissenting opinion, the opinion-writing Judge shall hold the
opinion for an additional twenty days, during which period the concurring or dis-
senting Judge shall submit an opinion to the opinion-writing Judge, to be filed on
the same date as the opinion of the Court. A dissenting or concurring Judge shall
also inform all other Judges of such intention and shall circulate the opinion to
them when written. The opinion-writing Judge shall consider concurrences and
dissents and the reasons for them, and may revise the draft opinion and recircu-
late it. If a concurring opinion or dissenting opinion is not received by the
opinion-writing Judge within the twenty-day period, the opinion writing Judge
shall consider the previous intent to be waived and may proceed to file the opin-
ion of the Court and any concurring opinions or dissenting opinions actually sub-
mitted to the opinion-writing Judge. A Judge on the Court en banc or panel may
join in a concurring or dissenting opinion and shall so notify the opinion-writing
Judge, who shall be responsible for noting the joinder of that Judge in such con-
curring opinion or dissenting opinion. When a Judge circulates a concurring or
dissenting opinion, the opinion of the Court and any concurring or dissenting
opinion may be filed no earlier than ten days after the circulation of the concur-
ring or dissenting opinion.

opinion and favor a result or rationale contrary to it, the presiding Judge with
respect to that case shall reassign it to a Judge who represents the new majority
view.

(a)

If a Judge who is not a member of the en banc Court or of the panel
before which a case is argued, or to which it is submitted, responds with an
objection to the draft opinion, the opinion-writing Judge shall consider the objec-
tion and reasons for it, and may revise the draft opinion and recirculate it as
deemed necessary.

(b) An objecting Judge shall also inform all other Judges of the objection and
the reasons for it. An objection, however, shall not entitle the objecting Judge to

§ 69.256. Decisions; Effect of Disagreements.

(a)

If a draft opinion in circulation in any case produces any combination of
four or more proposed dissents, objections, or concurring opinions, the opinion-
writing Judge shall not file the opinion but shall notify the President Judge to list
the case for consideration at the next judicial conference. For purposes of this
subsection the notation ‘‘concur in result only’’ shall not be considered in the
foregoing combination. If, pursuant to vote after judicial conference consider-
ation, a majority of all of the Judges, as well as a majority of the Judges who
heard the case or to whom it was submitted on briefs, favor the result reached in
the circulated draft opinion, that opinion, together with any concurring or dissent-
ing opinions and notations of concurrences or dissents, shall be filed. Otherwise,
if judicial conference consideration and vote does not warrant reassignment in
accordance with § 69.254, the President Judge shall list the case for reargument
before the Court en banc.

(b) When there exists a vacancy or a recusal among the Commissioned
Judges that results in an even number of Commissioned Judges voting on a cir-
culating panel opinion or en banc opinion, and when the vote of all participating
Commissioned Judges results in a tie, the opinion shall be filed as circulated. The
opinion shall contain a footnote on the first page indicating that the opinion is
filed pursuant to this paragraph. Unless there is a majority vote of the participat-
ing Commissioned Judges to report, the opinion shall not be reported.

Pursuant to the circulation of a draft opinion accompanied by a notation in
accordance with § 69.252 that the proposed panel decision would overrule a pre-
vious panel decision, if a majority of the Court agrees that such an overruling
would result, the President Judge shall list the matter on the agenda of the next
judicial conference for consideration as to reargument.

stated in prior decisions;

(3) modifies or criticizes an existing rule of law;

pated. If the opinion of this Court so adopting a trial court opinion is unreported,

necessary sanctions for the failure of any attorney or party to comply with the
requirements of the Mediation Program.

(5) The mediation statement required by this section, and any other docu-

(2) After a matter has been selected for mediation, the Prothonotary shall

appropriate, shall promptly contact the parties to establish the location, date
and time for mediation.

(3) Within ten days of receiving notice of mediation, or as otherwise
directed, each party shall submit to the Mediation Judge a confidential media-
tion statement of no more than five pages, setting forth the positions of the
party as to the key disputed and undisputed facts and legal issues in the matter,
and stating whether prior settlement negotiations have occurred. The mediation
statement shall focus on practical considerations in the matter and the party’s

Court and their disposition. The mediation statement shall not be filed with the
Prothonotary or served upon opposing parties, and shall remain confidential.

require the parties (or real parties in interest) to attend mediation. In cases
involving the Commonwealth government, upon direction of the Mediation
Judge, counsel shall have available someone from the appropriate agency with
authority to settle who can be reached during mediation to discuss settlement if
such person is not already required to attend the mediation session. In the
alternative, the Mediation Judge may obtain the name and title of the govern-
ment official or officials authorized to settle on behalf of the state or local gov-
ernment unit.

determines that further sessions are necessary to effectuate a settlement. The
Mediation Judge assigned to mediate a matter shall attend all future mediation
sessions scheduled in the case.

(3) All participants in the Mediation Program shall act with due diligence

and in good faith.

(4) The Mediation Judge shall not disclose the substance of the mediation
settlement discussions and proceedings, and counsel likewise shall not disclose
such discussions and proceedings to anyone other than their clients or
co-counsel. No information obtained during settlement discussions shall be
construed as an admission against interest, and the parties shall not use any
information obtained during settlement discussions as the basis for any motion
or application other than one related to the Court’s briefing or argument sched-

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
