Pennsylvania	Judiciary	Awarded	Federal	Grant	
to	Further	Develop	Programs	to	Protect	Elders

The Pennsylvania judiciary 
has been awarded over 
$1 million in federal 
Elder Justice Innovation 
Grant funds to further 
support its work to protect 
older Pennsylvanians. 
Pennsylvania was one of 
three states to receive the 
award.

The three-year grant, 
awarded through the 
federal Administration for 
Community Living, Elder 
Justice Innovation Grant 
program, aims to provide 
assistance to states in 
their efforts to assess and 
implement improvements 
in the handling of adult 
guardianship cases. 

“We are grateful for 
this grant award, 
which will allow us to 
continue educating 
elders and their families 
about guardianship,” 
Pennsylvania Chief 
Justice Debra Todd said. 
“Knowledge is power and 
these additional resources 
provide a tremendous 
opportunity to develop new 
and innovative programs 
and trainings which will 
give people the information 
they need to change lives 
across Pennsylvania. 

“We are pleased that 
Pennsylvania was 
successful in winning 
this award, amid such 
a competitive group of 
applicants. We extend 
our sincere thanks to 
the Administration for 
Community Living.”

The grant work in 
Pennsylvania will be 
overseen by the Office 

we can further develop 
relationships to continue 
building on the existing 
system in place to support 
elders and their families.”

by the Administration for 
Community Living (ACL),

of Elder Justice in the 
Courts (OEJC) which 
was established by the 
Supreme Court to assist 
the Court in implementing 
recommendations 
contained in the 2014 Elder 
Law Task Force’s Report 
and Recommendations. 

The OEJC, along with 
the Advisory Council on 
Elder Justice and the 
Courts, is committed to 
protecting Pennsylvania’s 
rapidly growing population 
of elders from all forms 
of abuse and neglect, 
promoting best practices 
and educating judges, 
court staff, attorneys, 
guardians and the public 
about elder abuse. 

Among the projects 
planned, the OEJC and 
the Advisory Council 
intend to deploy two 
pilot projects focused on

providing trained counsel 
to represent alleged 
incapacitated persons in 
guardianship proceedings 
and using court-appointed 
volunteer monitors to visit 
the individual prior to and 
following the appointment 
of a guardian. They will also 
develop and implement 
continuing education 
programs and online 
video modules for judges, 
court staff, attorneys and 
guardians.

“We are thrilled to pilot 
these new programs along 
with the help of our court 
and community partners,” 
Montgomery County 
Administrative Orphans’ 
Court Judge Lois Murphy 
said. “Initiatives like these 
directly impact elders and 
their families and allow 
us to learn more about 
what they need and how 

Northumberland	County	Courthouse	
Renovations	Nearly	Complete

The Northumberland County Courthouse Rehabilitation 
project – including interior and exterior renovations – is 
expected to be finished by the end of this year.

Though a magnificent structure, just like most historic 
buildings, the courthouse suffered from issues caused by 
aging such as cracks, water damage, general wear and 
the lack of a proper HVAC system.   

“The courthouse has been the visible symbol of 
Northumberland County government for more than 150 
years. The exterior facelift has provided much needed 
aesthetic and structural improvements and the installation 
of HVAC throughout the building will improve air flow, 
have better temperature control and create an improved 
working environment,” said Northumberland County 
District Court Administrator Kevin O’Hearn.

“The repurposing of the law library into a courtroom along 
with the addition of a new conference room allows for 
additional space to accommodate the county’s increasing 
caseload. This renovation will allow the courthouse to 
retain the historical character of the building while meeting 
current needs.”

Originally constructed in 1865, a subsequent three-story 
major addition was built on the southern portion of the 
building in 1911. In addition, the building was placed on the 
U.S. Department of Interior’s National Register of Historic 
Places in July 1974.

The building’s appearance is distinguished by its 
brownstone corner quoins, sills, headers and wall accents 
at doorways and window openings – in addition to a 
clock tower with a copper dome. The building’s interior 

3

arrangement is still in keeping with the original 1865 
and 1911 schemes, which is partially due to the original 
masonry construction and the later addition being steel 
and concrete. 

The project began in February 2020 with a study that 
assessed what needed to be done to properly renovate 
the building, and renovation work began in June 2021. 
The $4.5 million project is funded through a combination 
of grant awards and county funds.

“I am extremely proud of the renovated courthouse – 
a visible symbol of the importance of the court in the 
community.  It is worthy of its position on the corner of the 
town square park, and its clock tower and gold dome can 
be seen from afar, both in the daytime and lit up at night, 
even from the other side of the Susquehanna River,” said 
President Judge Charles H. Saylor. 

“This is a facility that retained all of its historical features 
of a century and a half old courthouse, with present day 
practicality,” he said. 

A few minor renovations, such as the replacement of its 
stained-glass windows, will take place at a later date. Also, 
the landscape around the Courthouse will be undergoing 
some improvements to complement the refurbished style 
of the building.  

The next time you are driving through Sunbury, Pa., listen 
for the ringing of the clock tower bell, dating back to 1872. 

The bell rings on the hour every hour.

Coming	Soon:	New	Interactive	
Magisterial	District	Court	Map	

By Michael Passiment, administrator, AOPC/Judicial District Operations and Programs 

The ability to visualize data can 
improve outcomes for public sector 
decision makers and citizens alike. 

During the height of the COVID-19 
pandemic, some public health officials 
turned to data visualization tools to 
monitor and target procurement of 
resources to those regions most in 
need. Likewise, citizens used mapping 
technology to know the extent of 
COVID-19 cases in their community 
and respond to public health notices 
accordingly.

Connecting citizens with critical 
government agencies and services 
is considered a fundamental goal of 
all public sector agencies. Likewise, 
programs that ensure the courts are 
accessible are a key responsibility 
for the Administrative Office of 
Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC). 

The AOPC/Judicial District Operations 
and Programs department is 
preparing to launch an interactive 
magisterial district court (MDC) map. 

Developed in partnership with the 
Pennsylvania State Data Center, this 
map will allow users to visualize the 
boundaries of all magisterial districts 
in Pennsylvania. 

Users will also be able to locate MDJ 
office locations and pinpoint other key 
criminal justice stakeholder locations 
(e.g., police departments, prisons and 
central court locations).

This map will also serve as a valuable tool for judges, 
court administrators and other judiciary stakeholders 
who receive regular public inquiries regarding 
magisterial district jurisdiction and boundaries. 

For judicial districts that eliminated or realigned 
magisterial districts as part of the decennial 
reestablishment process, this tool will be helpful in 
adjusting to the new boundaries.

Figure 1: Landmarks plotted 
across the commonwealth, 
including police departments, 
prisons and magisterial district 
courts, on the new MDC map.

The use of this map for basic 
magisterial district information is 
simply the beginning. With a base 
map now established, this tool 
can continue to be developed to 
include more detailed information 
on case filings and other statistics. 

It can continue to serve the public 
by keeping them informed and 
facilitate more thorough and 
effective decision making for 
administrators and judges across 
the commonwealth.

The map will be available for public 
use on the PA Courts website in 
January 2023.

Figure 2: Dauphin County MDCs displayed on the new map. In addition to boundaries, users 
can locate relevant criminal justice landmarks (prisons, police departments and MDJ courts). 
NOTE: Boundaries displayed here are not reflective of the recently adopted realignments/
eliminations as part of the decennial Reestablishment process.

Regardless of their community 
or profession, the panelists 
were engaging, passionate and 
appreciative of the opportunity to 
share insights and offer thoughts 
about how the court can enhance its 
relationship with its local communities.

In the final training segment, 
attendees were asked to consider 
what they learned throughout 
the full-day training and create a 
multidisciplinary action plan to support 
the needs of the diverse survivors in 
their communities. 

They discussed the process gaps in 
their court and brainstormed ways 
to share resources and internal 
knowledge across systems and 
jurisdictions. Natalia Petrova, 
Interpreter Program administrator, 
answered questions about the 
interpreter certification process and 
where to find pre-translated court 
forms. 

Rather than attributing characteristics 
of a group to an individual, a culturally 
responsive approach responds to 
individual needs by building inclusive 
environments. 

The team that put this training series 
together is optimistic that attendees 
returned to their home jurisdiction, 
ready to lead their courts into a future 
where diverse survivors' needs are at 
the forefront. 

A webinar for court staff, including 
programming and panel presentations 
from this training series, will be 
available in 2023.

The	Culturally	Responsive	Court	

By Amy Kehner, judicial programs administrator and Jamie Pizzi, AOPC STOP 
grant consultant

How culturally responsive is your 
court? In 2021, the AOPC contracted 
with the Center for Court Innovation 
(CCI) to lead an assessment of the 
commonwealth's protection order 
processes using online surveys and 
direct interviews.

CCI’s findings include interpreter 
services enhancements and forms to 
provide more consistent services to 
the diverse communities we serve. 

While these problems are not unique 
to Pennsylvania, they highlight areas 
where our courts can become more 
responsive to the needs of the diverse 
populations they serve who have 
experienced interpersonal violence, 
sexual assault and stalking. 

Using findings from the assessment, 
the AOPC's STOP Violence Against 
Women Formula Grant Team and 
Interpreter Program combined efforts 
to create The Culturally Responsive 
Court – Regional Justice System 
Training Series. 

AOPC offered sessions in Pittsburgh, 
State College, Lancaster, Philadelphia, 
Bethlehem and Scranton from 
Nov. 15 through Dec. 1. Over 400 
management-level stakeholders 
attended this unique educational 
opportunity where the audience 
included judges, court administrators,  
police, advocates, attorneys, juvenile 
and adult probation supervisors and 
others. 

The program included programming 
from CCI, a presentation on 
accent bias by AOPC's Interpreter 
Certification Coordinator, Ilana 
Torres, and a lively discussion 
with an expert forensic linguist, Dr. 
Robert Leonard. Each location also 
featured a local judge to moderate 
an esteemed panel of diverse 
community representatives unique to 
each training site, determined by the 
languages most spoken in that region. 

The panels highlighted cultures, 
including Colombian, Congo, Bhutan, 
Egyptian, South Korean, Asian-Pacific, 
Swahili, Burmese, Russian, Chinese 
and the Plain Communities (Amish/Old 
Order Mennonite). The panelists were 
as distinctive as their cultures and 
included certified Pennsylvania Court 
interpreters, court employees, college 
professors, lawyers and an engineer 
turned writer, educator and speaker.

Legislative Roundup by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

On Nov. 30, the 2021-22 legislative session ended. Bills not enacted during the two-year 
session must be reintroduced next session. During the session, over 2,900 House and 1,300 
Senate bills were introduced – 293 bills were enacted into law, three amendments to the 
constitution were passed either for a first or second time, and 17 vetoes were issued.  

In early November, all 203 House and 25 Senate seats were 
on the ballot.  The results will bring significant changes 
to the General Assembly, especially in the House.  After 
a delay waiting for outcomes in two races – the 142nd in 
Bucks County and the 151st in Montgomery County – the 
Democrats claimed a slim 102-101 majority in the House.     

The margin is not without complications.  Included in the 
Democrats 102 is Rep. Tony DeLuca, who passed away in 
October but won the election. Additionally, Representatives 
Summer Lee and Austin Davis were reelected to their 
state House seats and to other offices. Both have since 
resigned their House seats. All three seats require special 
elections, and both caucus leaders issued election writs. 
While agreement had existed on the date of the special 
election for the DeLuca seat – February 7 – the dates for 
the other two differ. Democrats set the elections for those 
seats also for February 7, while the Republicans set them 
for May 16. A lawsuit filed by the Republican Leader in 
Commonwealth Court seeks an order declaring the writs 
issued by the Democratic Leader invalid and enjoining the 
board of elections from proceeding with the February 7 
special elections.  

The Senate is much less complex. The Democrats picked 
up one seat, a new district in the Lehigh Valley, and the 

chamber stands at 27-22 in favor of the GOP, with one 
vacancy in the safe GOP 27th district.  

Both chambers will convene on Jan. 3 for swearing-in 
ceremonies.  

Senate Condolence Resolution –  
Chief Justice Baer 

Senate Resolution 381 honors the life and achievements of 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court Chief Justice Max Baer. The 
resolution was adopted by the Senate 50-0.  

Proposed Constitutional Amendments  
Article V (Judiciary) 

At least 12 proposed amendments seeking to amend Art. 
V were introduced in the 2021-22 session. One of the 
proposed amendments, providing for district elections for 
appellate court judges, had already passed in the prior 
legislative session (2019-20). After being voted from a 
House committee early in 2021, the bill languished on the 
floor and died with the end of session.   

The other proposed amendments – establishing term 
limits for appellate jurists, requiring all jurists to stand 
for reelection, creating a legislative role in procedural 

6

rulemaking, requiring the election of common pleas 
president judges in counties with three or more judges, 
establishing appellate court merit selection, repealing the 
judicial compensation clause, establishing six-year terms 
for all jurists, and requiring Supreme Court justices to run 
for reelection every four years – had not passed previously 
nor were they considered in enough time this session 
to meet the constitutional deadline for publication three 
months before the next general election.   

Thus, all 12 proposed amendments will require 
reintroduction in the 2023-24 session and, if passed, a 
second passage in 2025-26 will be required before any can 
be submitted to the electorate.  

Endangerment of Public Safety Official 

Act 165 of 2022 amends Title 18, codifying a new offense, 
endangerment of a public safety official. The act defines 
the offense as intentionally or knowingly communicating, 
or publishing through an electronic social media service, 
the restricted personal information of a public safety official 
or a family or household member thereof with reckless 
disregard or the intent that the information will be used to 
threaten, intimidate or facilitate the commission of a crime 
against the public safety official or a family or household 
member. 

The offense is graded generally as a misdemeanor of the 
first degree, unless the offense results in bodily injury, 
in which it is a felony of the first degree. The act defines 
public safety official by cross reference to 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702 
(c), which includes judges of any court in the judiciary.

MDJs and Referral to Collection Agencies 

Act 163 of 2022 amends Title 42, allowing MDJs to turn 
delinquent accounts over to a private collection entity if 
a defendant fails to appear for a financial determination 
hearing. A defendant may request a new hearing, and upon 
such request, collection activities must cease, but may 
resume if the defendant fails to appear at the new financial 
determination hearing. The act allows for the waiver or 
reductions of fines and costs for defendants found unable 
to pay, except those levied pursuant to the Crimes Victim 
Act. 

Family Finding 

Act 118 of 2022 amends Titles 42 and 67, requiring that 
during a permanency hearing a court must determine 
whether a transition plan and services are being provided 
and, for child who is 18 years of age, whether a suitable 
transition plan has been presented. The act clarifies the 
legislative intent of family finding to ensure that each child 
leaving foster care at age 18 and older is prepared for 
transition to successful adulthood.   

The act updates the definition of family finding to better 
reflect current practice and defines the terms permanency 
plan and transition plan. The act provides for new statutory 
sections specifically governing permanency and transition 
plans and services and requires county agencies to submit 
data to DHS for a child 18 years of age and older at the time 
the court terminates jurisdiction over the child.   

Finally, Act 118 incorporates provisions of separate 
legislation outlining a comprehensive, but technical 
reorganization of Title 67, including moving Family Finding 
and Kinship Care from Chapter 31 to Chapter 75.  

Greater Father Involvement 

Act 114 of 2022 creates the Pennsylvania Advisory 
Committee on Greater Father Involvement within the Joint 
State Government Commission (JSGC). The act requires 
the JSGC to appoint at least 13 individuals to the advisory 
committee, including those with expertise in adoption 
and foster care, family law and custody, and the juvenile 
dependency and delinquency systems.  

The advisory committee is directed to work with 
government and other entities to recognize and promote 
the contributions that fathers make to improving societal 
outcomes for children and families, evaluate governmental 
programs and initiatives that impact fatherhood and 
make recommendations regarding needed improvements, 
develop a comprehensive plan to support early and lifelong 
father/child connections and recommend changes to 
statutes, rules and regulations. The committee must issue 
a report to the governor and the General Assembly by Dec. 
31, 2023.   

Titles 23 and 67 Study 

House Resolution 228 was adopted by the House 168-32 
and no Senate action is required. The resolution directs 
the JSGC to conduct a comprehensive study of “statutes 
and regulations promulgated under Titles 23 and 67 … 
in the past five years [that remain] in effect [and] have 
exacerbated trauma in children and families and make 
recommendations on statutes and regulations in a trauma-
informed manner.” The resolution requires the JSGC to 
establish an advisory committee within 90 days of adoption 
to assist with the study. 

Suspension of Operating Privilege 

Act 107 of 2022 amends Title 75, requiring PennDOT 
to update driver records to address an active sanction 
imposed for a conviction of any controlled substance 
offense under law, changing the record to indicate the 
active departmental sanction has ended. The act repeals 
provisions imposing a suspension of operating privilege 
upon receipt of a certified record of conviction, adjudication 

7

of delinquency or admission into a preadjudication program 
for the offenses of misrepresentation of age to secure liquor 
or malt or brewed beverages, purchase, consumption, 
possession or transportation of liquor or malt or brewed 
beverages and carrying a false identification card.   

House Rule Changes 
Car Lease and Remote Participation 

House Resolution 243 was divided and considered in two 
parts by the House. Senate action is not required. First, the 
resolution repeals provision currently authorizing the chief 
clerk to enter into a master lease agreement with DGS for 
the long-term lease of automobiles for House members 
and adds language expressly prohibiting the practice. The 
resolution further prohibits members from using state 
funds to purchase automobiles for official purposes.  This 
part of the resolution was adopted 191-1.   

Second, the resolution repeals the rules currently allowing 
for voting by designation on the House floor and in 
committee, as well as remote interactive participation in 
House session by the members. This part of the resolution 
was adopted 109-83.   

Impeachment of Philadelphia District Attorney 
Larry Krasner 

House Resolution 240 was adopted by the House 107-
85. A trial in the Senate pursuant to Pa. Const. Art. VI, § 5 
will commence next year. The resolution brought seven 
articles of impeachment. The articles allege misbehavior in 
office in dereliction of duty and refusal to enforce the law, 
obstruction of a House Select Committee investigation, 
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and the 
Code of Judicial Conduct for impropriety and appearance 
of impropriety in three cases, violation of victim rights and 
violation of the Constitution of Pennsylvania by usurpation 
of the legislative function.   

The speaker appointed Reps. Tim Bonner (R-Mercer), Craig 
Williams (R-Delaware) and Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia) 
as impeachment managers. The Senate adopted Senate 
Resolution 386 and Senate Resolution 388 to establish 
rules for the impeachment proceeding and directing the 
issuance of a writ of impeachment summons.

Emerging	Issues:	Measuring	Success

In October, Andrea Tuominen, deputy 
state court administrator, and Angela 
Sobol Lowry, Problem-Solving Courts 
administrator, traveled to Colorado for 
the 2022 Treatment Courts Summit, 
along with Montgomery County 
Common Pleas Judge Steven O’Neill, 
who oversees the county’s drug court 
and opioid intervention court and 
serves as faculty for the National Drug 
Court Institute. 

This bi-annual meeting was convened 
by the Behavioral Health Committee 
of the Conference of Chief Justices 
and Conference of State Court 
Administrators and the Council of 
State Treatment Court Coordinators.  

The summit was held at the Colorado 
State Court Administrator’s Office 
in Denver, which provided an 
opportunity for chief justices (or 
designee), state court administrators 
(or designee) and state-level 

treatment court coordinators to 
network, share research, best 
practices and policies and develop 
a plan to enhance problem-solving 
courts in each state. 

The theme of this year’s summit was 
Emerging Issues: Measuring Success. 
The summit provided an opportunity 
for attendees to hear from experts on 
topics such as emerging drug trends, 
measuring fidelity to the treatment 
court model, universal screening and 
assessment and harm reduction.  

One of the focus points of the summit 
looked at best-practice standards – 
essentially, how a program measures 
success is their adherence to the 
best-practice standards which are 
rooted in research and help to 
guide the work of treatment courts 
(accrediting programs, trainings, data 
collection, etc.).

The summit helped validate some 
of the initiatives that Pa. is already 
working on such as enhancing and

Autism	and	Dependency	Court	Regional	Summits	Educate	
and	Train	Dependency	Court	Personnel	and	Partners

Spearheaded by Supreme Court Justice Kevin Dougherty 
on behalf of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, two 
regional summits were recently held in the northeast and 
central regions on Autism 101, diagnosis and community 
support to educate and train local courthouse personnel, 
child welfare professionals and dependency court partners, 
including juvenile and adult probation and other community 
providers.

“Education and awareness are critical to ensuring we are 
providing for the needs of all Dependency Court users, 
especially those with autism,” Justice Dougherty said. “The 
more we learn, the more we grow as a system and as a 
community, but most importantly in our ability to be part of 
the type of positive change that will impact Pennsylvania 
families.” 

Over 500 attendees, representing 60 different 
organizations from 25 counties, including local children and 
youth, courthouse personnel, law enforcement, schools and 
community service providers, were present between the 
two locations. 

The regional summits are part of a five-county, effort to 
expand locally on the work that the statewide Autism and 
Dependency Court taskforce has undertaken.

With nearly one in 44 children and one in 56 adults* 
diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), judges 
are sure to have individuals living with autism come before 

them. The primary goal of the Autism and Dependency 
Court Taskforce is to provide a positive dependency court 
experience for children and parents with ASD by increasing 
professional awareness and responsiveness.

The planning committee for the regional summits included:

•  Lead Dependency Judge, Judge Ryan Tira,  

•  Children and Youth Administrator, Matthew Salvatori, 

•  President Judge Michael Sholley, Snyder and Union

Adams	County	One-Stop	Shop	Serving	Clients	and	Families		

In January 2022, Adams 
County Domestic Relations 
Section established an 
employment program to 
connect with unemployed 
defendants with opportunities 
to obtain gainful employment. 

This initiative was in 
collaboration with Pennsylvania 
CareerLink and local 
employers who were able 
to provide employment and 
educational opportunities 
immediately following court 
proceedings.  

This one-stop shop approach 
provided clients leaving 
the courtroom with a PA 
CareerLink work search 
order, registration as well as 
orientation with PA CareerLink 
and in most cases offers of 
employment.  

All clients within the civil and 
criminal justice system are 
eligible for employment related 
funding through PA CareerLink.  

This funding provides 
assistance with overcoming a 
plethora of barriers to enable 
them to be successful with 
their employment goals.  

The program has significantly 
changed the perception of the 
Domestic Relations Sections’ 
mission of serving clients and 
families and increased child 
support collections.

Camp	
Abilities		

This past summer, Chester 
County Magisterial District Judge 
Marc Lieberman spent a week 
volunteering at an athletic camp for 
blind and deaf children.  

Camp Abilities in Brockport, NY is a 
one-week educational sports camp, 
usually held the week before the 4th 
of July.

The kids that attend camp are 
referred to as athletes whereas the 
counselors are known as coaches and 
come from all over the world.  Some 
coaches volunteer so they can learn 
how the camp is run and take those 
lessons back to their home country.  

There are about two coaches to 
every athlete when you include all 
the specialist individual coaches, 
nurses etc. – almost all of whom 
are volunteers. Each athlete has 
an individual coach to help them 
navigate Brockport’s campus. 

Judge Lieberman’s role at the camp 
was to take the campers sailing on 
Lake Ontario. Known as Coach Marc, 
the sailing instructor, he taught the 
class with his father and a visually 
impaired sailboat racer from Florida. 

“It’s incredible to watch a kid who is 
blind figure out which way the wind 
is blowing and get the feel of how to 
steer the boat accordingly,” he said. 

The athletes get to experience a 
variety of activities during camp. They 
learn to run, swim, kayak, paddle 
board, climb a ropes course, play 
Beep Baseball and Goalball. Goalball 
is a paralympic sport and some of the 
U.S. Paralympic Goalball team was in 
attendance at this year’s camp.  

“If you want to be inspired, watch 
a 10-year-old kid that is visually 
impaired, that is probably only about 
4 feet tall and weighs around 50 
lbs. climb a ropes course and walk 

across a tight rope 30 feet up,” Judge 
Lieberman said. 

Dr. Lauren Lieberman, professor at 
SUNY Brockport in Adaptive Physical 
Education and Judge Lieberman’s 
sister, created the camp over 25 
years ago and has since started these 
camps all over the world, including 
an upcoming trip to start a camp 
in Kenya. Notably, there is a Camp 
Abilities at West Chester University as 
well as others throughout the U.S. 

Most of the athletes, when at home, 
don’t get to spend a lot of time with 
other blind and hearing-impaired kids 
and so it is really empowering for 
these kids to spend time together.  

Many have also had very little physical 
activity throughout their life as parents 
often live in fear that their child may 
get hurt and schools do not always 
know how to include them.  

Most physical education (P.E.) 
teachers don’t know what to do with 
a blind or deaf child, so they often 
sit out during P.E. The camp teaches 
them what they are capable of and 
how to advocate for themselves. 
The athlete can go back to his or her 
school and tell the P.E. teacher how 
he or she can be included.  

11

The camp empowers the kids to not 
only participate in P.E. but teaches 
them they can participate in other 
areas of society as well. 

“You know the camp is successful 
when it’s time to leave. Tears are 
shed by both athletes and coaches 
knowing that they will have to wait 
a whole year before they can come 
back,” Judge Lieberman said.

Justice Mundy was joined

Emeritus Tom Saylor, 
Justices Kevin Dougherty 
and Kevin Brobson as well 
as Geoff Moulton, state 
court administrator and 
Terry Sachs, counsel to 
the Court. 

The panel discussion 
covered the Court’s history,

use of specialty courts and 
new initiatives focused on 
providing access to justice 
for individuals with an

Act of 1722, the Supreme 
Court of Pennsylvania is 
the oldest appellate court 
in North America, predating 

even the Supreme Court of 
the United States by nearly 
70 years and for which it 
served as a model as the 
federal appellate court was 
established.

300th anniversary. 

On behalf of the Court, 
Justice Sallie Mundy 
conceptualized the panel 
discussion as a way to

“The work and opinions 
of this court impact 
residents in all corners of

said. “Through these public 
forums, we’re giving an

Pa.	Courts	Language	Access	Plan	–	5	Year	Status	Report

It has been five years since the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania approved 
a statewide Language Access Plan for the Pa. Courts.  

The purpose of the plan is to provide a framework for the provision of 
meaningful language access for those individuals who are Limited English 
Proficient, deaf or hard of hearing and come into contact with the courts.

In October, the Monitoring and Evaluation Team, chaired by York County 
Judge Joseph C. Adams and tasked with reviewing and evaluating the 
implementation of the plan, released a five-year update report on the 
status of language access in our state. 

To date, the Pa. Courts have accomplished the majority of the action 
items set forth in the plan, including the development and dissemination 
of “I-Speak” cards, Right to Interpreter posters, a judicial bench card for 
working with interpreters and a multilingual Notice of Language Rights. 

Moving forward, the Pa. Courts will continue to train court staff, judges 
and attorneys on language access and to engage in outreach efforts to 
educate and recruit more candidates to become interpreter certified. 

If you or someone you know is bilingual in English and another language, 
please check out the Interpreter Certification Program web page for more 
information on how to become certified!  

Stop	the	Bleed	

On Sept. 22, AOPC/Judicial District 
Security partnered with Penn State 
Milton S. Hershey Medical Center 
personnel to deliver ‘STOP the Bleed’ 
training to over 28 employees at the 
Pennsylvania Judicial Center. 

‘Stop the Bleed’ training is a national 
initiative supported by the American 
College of Surgeons Committee on 
Trauma and provides participants with 
the knowledge, skills and abilities to 
save a life in a bleeding emergency. 

The Administrative Office of 
Pennsylvania Courts was excited to 
host this important educational event 
at the Pennsylvania Judicial Center 
since uncontrolled bleeding is the 
primary cause of death in trauma-
related injuries.

Deputy Court Administrator Andrea 
Tuominen said, “I am delighted to 
have so many employees trained 

in the skills necessary for a bleeding 
emergency and thank Judicial District 
Security for organizing this training. 
While we hope these skills will never be 
needed at work or in the community, it 
is reassuring to know that many of our 
employees are now certified in the event 
of a bleeding emergency might occur.”

Being a Strong Leader:  
Tips on Making Decisions, 
Coaching Employees and 
Communicating Effectively 

Excerpt reprinted with permission from BHS Focus 2022 

As a leader, you wear many hats. In addition to overseeing others, you are also likely to be in charge of making 
important decisions, coaching employees through situations and communicating with team members about 
important matters. To better develop effective leadership skills that will help you be successful in each of these 
areas, follow the guidelines below.  

As someone who makes decisions, you should:

•  Think things through. Don’t decide too hastily, and make sure to consider alternatives. Employees can be a 

great resource. Ask them for input regarding decisions when appropriate.   

•  Take risks, but know the consequences before you jump. 

•  Admit when you make a mistake, and use it as a learning tool. Share with others the lessons that you have 

been taught. 

As a coach who guides employees, you should:

•  Envision the goals that you and your team can accomplish. Seek and share the goals with your team, 

motivating them to get there.  

•  Show each member of the team that you are interested in his or her success. Notice unique skills and 

talents, and work with each member to develop them.  

•  Help resolve differences between team members. You can act as a mediator between two employees who 

don’t see eye-to-eye. When doing this, make sure you are fair and supportive to each employee. 

•  Be enthusiastic and honest to each employee. This will inspire them to be the same way.

•  Give the employee your full attention when he or she is speaking to you. Don’t be quick to criticize or judge, 

As a communicator, you should:

hear the person out, and think before you speak.  

•  Check if employees understand goals.

•  Give feedback to employees. This can be constructive criticism, but make sure you present it in an 

encouraging and supportive way. Be specific when an employee needs to make a change.   

•  Be calm when stressful situations arise. Be the voice of reason when things are tough.  

•  When communicating praise or criticism, use “I” statements to demonstrate how you feel. For example, “I 
was impressed by your latest presentation to our clients,” or, “I was hurt by what you said to co-workers about 
the team leaders.”

Judicial Task Force releases final report on 
state courts' response to mental illness

Continued collaboration between the courts, government 
agencies, mental health providers and others is critical to 
affect the systemic change needed to improve how courts 
respond to individuals with serious mental illness.

That was the message echoed during Tuesday’s release 
of the final report from the National Judicial Task Force 
to Examine State Courts’ Response to Mental Illness. The 
virtual event drew about 900 participants, including court 
officials, behavioral health professionals, and members of 
the news media.

“We see how the justice system can become a never-
ending highway of pain as it maneuvers people on a 
needless journey, with no off ramp, often to ineffective 
support and treatment,” said task force member Circuit 
Judge Nan Waller of Multnomah County, Oregon. 
“However, having had the privilege to serve on the task 
force has given me great optimism. The task force operated 
in a manner consistent with its recommendations, bringing 
together stakeholders from the behavioral health and 
justice systems, along with the important voices of those 
with lived experience, and then providing expert staff to 
help turn our thoughts and ideas into tools, bench cards, 
policy briefs, and research.”

Judge Waller joined task force co-chairs Chief Justice Paul 
L. Reiber of Vermont and New York Chief Administrative 
Judge Lawrence K. Marks to offer insights on ways the task 
force recommendations can positively impact individuals 
with severe mental illness during Tuesday’s virtual launch 
and policy discussion.

Two national mental health experts - Miriam E. Delphin-
Rittmon, Ph.D., the U.S. Health and Human Services 
Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use 
and leader of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 

Services Administration (SAMHSA) and Dr. Sarah Y. Vinson, 
Interim Chair of the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral 
Sciences at Morehouse School of Medicine – elaborated 
on ways the behavioral health community can partner with 
the courts to improve outcomes for individuals with serious 
mental illness.

“We know that our country is facing a mental health crisis,” 
Dr. Delphin-Rittmon said. “… I am confident that these 
recommendations and examples of successful programs 
have the potential to make really meaningful impacts in 
communities across the country.”

Among the task force recommendations, state courts 
should:

•  Convene justice and behavioral health system partners 

to identify opportunities to collaboratively improve 
responses to individuals with behavioral health disorders.

•  Promote processes to identify and divert individuals with 
behavioral health disorders at every stage of system 
involvement towards treatment and away from further 
penetration into the criminal justice system.

•  Examine current case management and calendaring 

practices and implement strategies to more quickly and 
effectively address issues presented in cases involving 
individuals with behavioral health needs.

Watch the recording of the webinar and download a copy 
of the final report and recommendations.

For additional information about the task force or future 
plans to implement these recommendations, contact Patti 
Tobias at ptobias@ncsc.org.
