MEMORANDUM BY STEVENS, P.J.E.: 

 

     FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

Appellant  Scott  M.  Rothman  (“Husband”)  appeals  from  the  July  29, 

2022,  divorce  decree,  which  made  final  the  trial  court’s  October  1,  2021, 

order.    That  order  granted  the  petition  of  Appellee  Sara  Johnson  Rothman 

(“Wife”) to confirm the validity and  enforceability of the parties’ Postnuptial 

Agreement, as well as dismissed Husband’s claim for equitable distribution.1 

After a careful review, we affirm.  

____________________________________________ 

* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court. 

 We note the trial court’s July 29, 2022, divorce decree, which incorporated 
the terms of the Postnuptial Agreement, rendered appealable the prior order 
related to the validity thereof, as well as the dismissal of Husband’s claim for 
equitable  distribution.  See  Sneeringer  v.  Sneeringer,  876  A.2d  1036 
(Pa.Super. 2005).

The  relevant  facts  and  procedural  history  are  as  follows:  The  parties 

were married on May 28, 2005, and they have two minor children.2  On July 

7, 2021, Wife filed a complaint in divorce averring the marriage is irretrievably 

broken.  She  sought  spousal  support,  alimony  pendente  lite,  and  alimony  in 

accordance with the parties’ Postnuptial Agreement, which was executed on 

July 23, 2020.  Further, in accordance with the provisions of the Postnuptial 

Agreement,  Wife  requested  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  be  incorporated  but 

not merged into the divorce decree.  Wife attached the Postnuptial Agreement 

to her complaint as an exhibit. 

 

On July 29, 2021, Husband filed an answer with a counterclaim. Therein, 

Husband agreed the parties’ marriage is irretrievably broken; however, in his 

answer,  he  “specifically  denied  that  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  is  a  valid, 

enforceable agreement.”  Husband’s Answer, filed 7/29/21, at 1.   

In his counterclaim, Husband requested the trial court equitably divide 

the marital property. He averred: 

Husband  disputes  that  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  provided  by 
Wife  is  a  valid,  enforceable  Agreement.    In  the  event  that  the 
parties are able  to  reach a future valid, enforceable agreement, 
Husband desires that such written agreement be approved by the 
Court  and  incorporated  into  any  divorce  decree  which  may  be 
entered dissolving the marriage between the parties.

On August 5, 2021, Wife filed a  petition for special relief wherein she 

sought a declaratory  judgment.  Specifically,  Wife sought an order declaring 

that the parties’ July 23, 2020, Postnuptial Agreement is valid, binding, and 

enforceable. Wife averred Husband, who is an attorney specializing in contract 

law, knowingly and voluntarily entered into the Postnuptial Agreement after a 

series  of  negotiations  between  Husband  and  Wife,  as  well  as  between 

Husband3  and  Wife’s  counsel.    Wife  asserted  Husband  provided  no  basis  to 

support his bald allegation that the Postnuptial Agreement is invalid.  

 

On  August  24,  2021,  Husband  filed  an  answer  in  opposition  to  Wife’s 

petition for special relief. Therein, as it relates to the Postnuptial Agreement, 

Husband asserted the following (verbatim): 

Wife has only just filed her Petition for a Declaratory Judgment on 
Husband’s statement that he does not believe the Agreement is 
valid.  Husband submits the agreement is valid[4] due to not being 
voluntary, duress, lack of consideration and/or failure to perform 
consideration.  The Agreement is unconscionable and impossible 
to perform. 

usband’s Answer, filed 8/24/21, at 1 (footnote added). 

By order filed on October 1, 2021, the trial court provided the following 

in its entirety (verbatim): 

 
[A]fter  review  of  briefs  and  the  record  in  the  above 
captioned  matter,  it  is  hereby  ORDERED  and  DECREED  that

3  The  cover  page  of  the  July  23,  2020,  Postnuptial  Agreement  indicates 
Husband was pro se. 

 As discussed infra, Husband asserts the word “valid” is a typographical error, 
and he intended to use the word “invalid”.

Trial Court Order, filed 10/1/21 (bold omitted). 

 

On  October  1,  2021,  Husband  filed  a  motion  for  reconsideration 

requesting the trial court vacate its order to afford Husband a “full and fair” 

hearing,  as  well  as  permit  him  to  amend  his  answer  in  opposition  to  Wife’s 

petition  to  properly  reflect  his  contention  that  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  is 

“invalid”.  On October 26, 2021, Husband filed a notice of appeal from the trial 

court’s October 1, 2021, order.   

Meanwhile, the parties entered into a stipulation for payments under the 

Postnuptial Agreement, and on October 29, 2021, the trial court entered an 

order,  which  memorialized  the  parties’  stipulated  payments.  Moreover,  on 

January  28,  2022,  Husband  filed  a  petition  for  leave  to  amend  the 

typographical  error,  which  he  made  in  his  answer  to  Wife’s  petition  as 

discussed supra.  The trial court denied Husband’s petition for leave to amend 

the typographical error pursuant to the law of the case doctrine.  

 

On January 3, 2022, this Court sua sponte quashed Husband’s October 

26, 2021, notice of appeal on the basis it was taken from  a non-appealable 

interlocutory order.  Specifically, this Court noted that  a divorce decree had 

not been entered, so the economic issues were not yet reviewable.  

- 4 - 

J-A03001-23 

 

 On March 23, 2022, Wife filed an Affidavit under Section 3301(d) of the 

Divorce  Code  indicating  the  date  of  the  parties’  separation  was  on  or  after 

December 5, 2016, and a divorce decree should be entered since the marriage 

is irretrievably broken.  On  April 8, 2022, Husband  filed  a Counter-Affidavit 

under Section 3301(d) of the Divorce Code indicating he opposed the entry of 

a  divorce  decree  since  economic  claims  remain  pending.  He  specifically 

indicated he wished to pursue economic claims. He noted he had previously 

claimed  economic  relief  in  the  matter,  but  the  same  was  erroneously 

dismissed  in  contravention  to  23  Pa.C.S.A.  §  3502  and  without  a  proper 

opportunity to be heard.   

 

On  May  11,  2022,  Wife  filed  a  motion  to  strike  Husband’s  Section 

3301(d) Counter-Affidavit so that she could proceed with the filing of a Notice 

of  Intent  to  Request  Divorce  Decree.  Wife  averred  there  are  no  economic 

claims pending.  By order entered on June 14, 2022, the trial court granted 

Wife’s  motion  to  strike  Husband’s  Section  3301(d)  Counter-Affidavit  on  the 

basis  Husband’s  economic  claims  had  been  dismissed  by  the  order  filed  on 

October 1, 2021.   

Upon  praecipe  by  Wife,  on  July  29,  2022,  the  trial  court  entered  a 

divorce decree, and on August 24, 2022, Husband filed a notice of appeal, as 

well  as  a  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(b)  statement.    On  September  23,  2022,  the  trial 

court filed a responsive Rule 1925(a) opinion.

J-A03001-23 

On appeal, Husband sets forth the following issues in his “Statement of 

Questions Involved” (verbatim): 

1.  Did  the  trial  court  commit  an  error  of  law  and/or  abuse  its 
discretion  by  entering  the  [October  1,]  2021,  Order  “after 
review of briefs and the record” when no briefs were filed, nor 
was either party afforded the opportunity to present a brief on 
the  issue  and  underlying  petition,  nor  was  any  hearing  held, 
record  developed,  nor  any  party  afforded  the  opportunity  to 
present testimony, nor was Husband afforded the opportunity 
to be heard regarding his claims of involuntariness, duress, lack 
of  consideration,  unconscionability,  and  impossibility,  as 
guaranteed by the right to due process? 

2.  Did  the  trial  court  commit  an  error  of  law  and/or  abuse  its 
discretion  by  basing  its  [October  1,]  2021,  Order  upon  one 
typographical error  amidst [Husband’s] entire pleading which 
contested  the  validity  of  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  and 
pleaded 
lack  of  consideration, 
involuntariness,  duress, 
unconscionability, and impossibility? 

3.  Did  the  trial  court  commit  an  error  of  law  and/or  abuse  its 
discretion  by  entering  the  [October  1,]  2021,  Order  granting 
declaratory relief in the instant divorce action in contravention 
of the clear language of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7541(c)(1)? 

4.  Did  the  trial  court  commit  an  error  of  law  and/or  abuse  its 
discretion by entering the [October 1,] 2021, Order dismissing 
for  equitable  distribution  and  by 
[Husband’s]  claim 
subsequently  entering  the  Divorce  Decree  granting  no  other 
relief in contravention to the clear language of 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 
3502? 

 

Husband’s Brief at 4-5 (suggested answers omitted). 

 

Initially,  we  address  Husband’s  third  issue.  Husband  contends  Wife 

procedurally  erred  in  filing  a  special  petition  seeking  declaratory  relief 

regarding  the validity of the  Postnuptial Agreement.   He specifically asserts 

the validity or enforceability of the parties’ Postnuptial Agreement was not a 

proper issue to be disposed of as a declaratory judgment action.   

- 6 - 

J-A03001-23 

We note Husband did not object to Wife’s petition on this basis in the 

trial  court.    In  any  event,  this  Court  has  previously  recognized  that  parties 

may file special petitions for declaratory judgment to determine the validity 

and enforceability of marital property settlement agreements. See Bianchi v. 

Bianchi,  859  A.2d  511,  515  (Pa.Super.  2004)  (reviewing  declaratory 

judgment action regarding parties’ property settlement agreement);  Sabad 

v.  Fessenden,  825  A.2d  682  (Pa.Super.  2003)  (reviewing  declaratory 

judgment action regarding validity of  parties’ antenuptial agreement).   See 

also Halsey v. Halsey, No. 1293 MDA 2019, 2020 WL 1492587 (Pa.Super. 

2020)  (unpublished  memorandum)5  (reviewing  trial  court’s  order  regarding 

petition  for  declaratory  judgment  as  it  relates  to  validity  of  prenuptial 

agreement, which was made final by entry of divorce decree). 

Turning to Husband’s first issue,  Husband contends  the trial court  did 

not afford him due process when it entered the October 1, 2021, order, which 

granted Wife’s request to declare the parties’ Postnuptial Agreement valid and 

dismissed  Husband’s  claim  for  equitable  distribution.  In  his  second  issue, 

which is intertwined with his first issue, Husband contends the trial court erred 

in  failing  to  read  the  totality  of  his  answer  in  opposition  to  Wife’s  special 

petition  for  declaratory  judgment.  Husband  contends  that,  in  context,  the

word  “valid”  was  clearly  a  typographical  error,  and  the  trial  court  erred  in 

The  thrust  of  Husband’s  first  and  second  issues  is  that  the  totality  of 

Husband’s  pleadings,  including  his  answer  and  counterclaim  to  the  divorce 

complaint,  as  well  as  his  answer  in  opposition  to  Wife’s  special  petition  for 

declaratory judgment, reveals he presented viable defenses to the validity and 

enforcement of the Postnuptial Agreement, i.e., he did not voluntarily enter 

into it, he was under duress, there was no consideration, it is unconscionable, 

and  it  is  impossible  to  perform.  He  contends  that,  since  he  raised  valid 

defenses,  he  was  entitled  to  due  process,  and  in  light  of  genuine  issues  of 

material fact regarding  his  defenses, the trial court erred in granting Wife’s 

petition  without  holding  a  hearing  to  take  testimony,  receive  evidence,  and 

The  determination  of  marital  property  rights  through 
prenuptial, postnuptial and settlement agreements has long been 
permitted, and even encouraged.  Both prenuptial and postnuptial 
agreements  are  contracts  and  are  governed  by  contract  law.  
Moreover,  a  court’s  order  upholding  the  agreement  in  divorce 
proceedings  is  subject  to  an  abuse  of  discretion  or  error  of  law 
standard of review.  An abuse of discretion is not lightly founded, 
as  it  requires  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  trial  court 
misapplied the law or failed to follow proper legal procedures.  We 
will not usurp the trial court’s fact-finding function.

permit cross-examination before ruling on the issue.   

Initially, we note the following relevant legal precepts: 

- 8 - 

J-A03001-23 

recognizing it as such.  

J-A03001-23 

As with other contracts, to form an enforceable postnuptial agreement, 

“there must be an offer, acceptance, consideration, or mutual meeting of the 

minds.”   McIlwain  v. Saber Healthcare Group, Inc., 208 A.3d 478, 485 

(Pa.Super. 2019).  “Under Pennsylvania law, it is presumed that an adult is 

competent to enter into an agreement, and a signed document gives rise to 

the presumption that it accurately expresses the state of mind of the signing 

party.”  See  Cardinal  v.  Kindred  Healthcare,  Inc.,  155  A.3d  46,  50 

(Pa.Super. 2017).  As such, “[c]ontracting parties are normally bound by their 

agreements, without regard to whether the terms thereof were read and fully 

understood and irrespective of whether the agreements embodied reasonable 

or  good  bargains.”  Nicholas  v.  Hofmann,  158  A.3d  675,  693  (Pa.Super. 

2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

Nonetheless, as is the case in any action upon a contract, defenses such 

as fraud, duress, unconscionability, or impossibility are available to challenge 

the  validity  of  a  postnuptial  agreement.  Lewis,  supra.  “Mutual  assent  is 

necessary  to  enter  into  a  contract;  mutual  assent  does  not  exist  however, 

when one of the contracting parties elicits the assent of the other contracting 

party  by  means  of  duress.”    Id.  at  714  (citation  omitted).    Further,  any 

contract may be found void if it is unconscionable.   Taylor v. Extendicare 

Health Facilities, Inc., 637 Pa. 163, 147 A.3d 490, 504, 509 (2016).  Also, 

this Court has recognized that, as with other contracts, legal impossibility, as 

defined in Section 261 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, is available 

- 9 - 

J-A03001-23 

as a defense to a marital settlement agreement. Luber v. Luber, 614 A.2d 

771, 774 (Pa.Super. 1992).  “Because settlement agreements are presumed 

valid and binding, the party seeking to avoid or nullify the agreement has the 

burden  of  proving  the  invalidity  of  the  agreement  by  clear  and  convincing 

evidence.” Lewis, 234 A.3d at 714 (citation omitted).   

Accordingly, based on the aforementioned, since Husband is the party 

seeking  to  avoid  or  nullify  the  parties’  Postnuptial  Agreement,  he  has  the 

burden of sufficiently pleading his defenses and then proving the defenses by 

clear  and  convincing  evidence.    See  id.  Husband  acknowledges  this  legal 

precept, but he contends he was denied the opportunity to prove his defenses 

when the trial court cancelled its conference on the matter. He notes the trial 

court initially scheduled the matter for a zoom conference; however, the trial 

court sua sponte cancelled the conference and entered the October 1, 2021, 

order  based  on  its  review  of  the  parties’  pleadings  and  exhibits.    Husband 

contends this was error.  Specifically, he asserts that, particularly when the 

trial court properly recognizes he made an inadvertent typographical error in 

his  answer  in  opposition  to  Wife’s  special  pleading,  he  sufficiently  pled  his 

defenses such that he was entitled to a hearing to resolve factual disputes. 

In response to Husband’s contention, the trial court relevantly indicated 

the following: 

Husband  argues  that  the  trial  court  erroneously  based  its 
entire  [October  1,  2021]  ruling  upon  “one  typographical  error 
amidst Husband’s entire pleadings which contested the validity of 
the Postnuptial Agreement, pleaded involuntariness, duress, lack 

- 10 - 

J-A03001-23 

impossibility.”  This 
of  consideration,  unconscionability  and 
allegation  of  error  is  a  red  herring.    Husband’s  entire  Answer  is 
insufficiently plead (sic). 

Husband’s  Answer  to  [Wife’s  divorce  complaint  merely 
denied  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  is  a  valid,  enforceable 
agreement]….To  explain,  duress, 
consideration, 
[unconscionability],  and  impossibility  are  affirmative  defenses 
which  must  be  pled  under  New  Matter,  or  such  defenses  are 
waived  per  Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  1030(a).[6]  
Husband’s  Answer  [to  Wife’s  divorce  complaint]  does  not  plead 
duress, lack of consideration, impossibility, [or unconscionability 
in  any  respect,  let  alone]  under  New  Matter,  thus  they  were 
waived.  

lack  of 

Further,  Husband [attempted to raise  his  defenses for the 
first time in his] Answer [to Wife’s special petition for declaratory 
judgment;  however,]  Husband’s  Answer  to  Wife’s  Petition 
provides no facts in support of any of the defenses, in violation of 
Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 206.2(a)[,] which mandates 
that an answer to a petition must state the material facts which 
constitute  the  defense  to  the  petition.  Accordingly,  per  Rule 
206.2(a),  Husband  waived  the  defenses  of  involuntariness, 
[unconscionability],  and 
duress,

(a)  Except  as  provided  by  subdivision  (b),  all  affirmative 
defenses including but not limited to the defenses of accord and 
satisfaction,  arbitration  and  award,  consent,  discharge 
in 
bankruptcy,  duress,  estoppel,  failure  of  consideration,  fair 
comment,  fraud,  illegality,  immunity  from  suit,  impossibility  of 
performance,  justification,  laches,  license,  payment,  privilege, 
release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, truth 
and  waiver  shall  be  pleaded  in  a  responsive  pleading  under  the 
heading “New Matter”. A party may set forth as new matter any 
other material facts which are not merely denials of the averments 
of the preceding pleading. 

(b)  The  affirmative  defenses  of  assumption  of  the  risk, 
comparative negligence and contributory negligence need not be 
pleaded.

impossibility by failing to plead any material facts constituting any 
of these affirmative defenses. 

rial Court Opinion, filed 9/23/22, at 7-8 (footnote added). 

We find no abuse of discretion or error of law in the trial court’s analysis.  

  T

 

Husband was given ample opportunity to present and develop his defenses in 

his answer to Wife’s divorce complaint, as well as his answer to Wife’s special 

petition for declaratory judgment.  However, he failed to raise the defenses in 

any manner in his answer to the divorce complaint. See Pa.R.C.P. 1030.  Also, 

giving his answer to Wife’s special petition a liberal reading, and recognizing 

he intended to use the word “invalid” instead of “valid”, he, at best, raised the 

defenses  in  his  answer  to  the  special  petition  in  a  bald,  conclusory  manner 

without any supporting material facts. See Pa.R.C.P. 206.2(a).  

Under these circumstances, the trial court did not err in determining the 

validity  of  the  Postnuptial  Agreement  based  on  the  pleadings  and  exhibits 

without holding an evidentiary hearing.  Simply put, contrary to his assertion, 

Husband was not denied due process due to the trial court’s failure to hold an 

evidentiary hearing or order briefs. See Vogt v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 

900 A.2d 912 (Pa.Super. 2006) (noting the procedures mandated for petition 

and pleading practice, including the filing of answers, under the Rules of Civil

Procedure provide sufficient safeguards to protect one’s constitutional right to 

notice and an opportunity to be heard).7  

 

In his fourth issue, Husband avers the trial court erred in dismissing his 

equitable  distribution  counterclaim.    He  contends  the  trial  court  violated  23 

Pa.C.S.A. § 3502, which relevantly holds: 

(a) General rule.--Upon the request of either party in an action 
for  divorce  or  annulment,  the  court  shall  equitably  divide, 
distribute  or  assign,  in  kind  or  otherwise,  the  marital  property 
between the parties without regard to marital misconduct in such 
percentages  and  in  such  manner  as  the  court  deems  just  after 
considering all relevant factors. 
 

23 Pa.C.S.A. § 3502(a) (bold in original). Husband contends the Postnuptial 

Agreement is invalid, and in denying Husband’s equitable distribution claim, 

the trial court did not consider “all relevant factors.”  Id. 

 

We note the parties’ Postnuptial Agreement, which the trial court found 

valid,  set  forth  in  detail  the  equitable  distribution  of  the  parties’  marital 

property.  Husband  does  not  challenge  the  trial  court’s  interpretation  of  this 

provision.  Rather, his claim is premised upon his previous arguments that, in 

light  of  his  alleged  defenses,  the  trial  court  should  have  held  a  hearing  to 

determine the validity of the Postnuptial Agreement. Given our analysis set 

forth supra, we find it unnecessary to address this issue further.  

____________________________________________ 

7  Also,  as  the  trial  court  noted,  inasmuch  as  Wife’s  special  petition  sought 
declaratory  relief,  absent  an  issue  of  fact,  a  hearing  was  not  required.  See 
Trial Court Opinion, filed 12/16/21, at 4 (citing 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 7539(b)).
