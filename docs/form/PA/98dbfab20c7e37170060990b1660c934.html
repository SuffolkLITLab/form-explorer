Senior Judge 
Assignments Fall

A two-year pilot program began in July 
2018 to review the use of senior judges 
within the Courts of Common Pleas, using 
data from the Judicial Needs Assessment 
(JNA).

Comparing month-to-month data from 
2017-2018, the period of July to October 
saw a more than 12% decrease in the 
number of assignments.

The JNA is also available for use in 
helping to determine whether county 
judicial complements are appropriate.

Combating 
elder abuse in 
Pennsylvania 

The Advisory Council on Elder 
Justice in the Courts’ latest Progress 
Report published in January details 
the efforts of the Advisory Council 
and the Office of Elder Justice in the 
Courts (OEJC) since the creation of 
the initial Elder Law Task Force in 
2013. 

Of the 130 recommendations made 
in the Elder Law Task Force’s Report, 
70 have been completed and 35 are 
currently in progress. 

“This report is evidence of 
Pennsylvania’s strong commitment 
to protecting its elders,” said 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice 
Debra Todd. “I am deeply grateful to 
all those who have contributed to the 
many successes detailed in the report, 
and who are affecting real change 
in the way that our commonwealth 
combats elder abuse.” 

Enhanced judicial 
administration

One of the most notable achievements 
of the Advisory Council has been the 
creation and implementation of the 
Guardianship Tracking System (GTS), 
which will allow the courts to better 
monitor active guardianships through a 
uniform statewide process. 

As of December, the GTS has 
successfully launched in all counties 
statewide. 

Among the system’s numerous 
advantages are the ability for 
guardians to file annual reports and 
inventories online, as well as the ability 
for judges to effectively communicate a 
concern regarding a specific guardian 
in the form of a statewide alert.

Another judicial automation 
enhancement of note is the update 
to both the common pleas and 
magisterial district judge case 
management systems to track cases in 

(l to r) Judge Lois Murphy, Judge Sheila Woods-Skipper, Judge Paula Francisco Ott, Justice Debra Todd

which at least one of the victims is age 
60 or older. 

Additionally, the Supreme Court 
approved a proposal to begin a pilot 
Elder Court Project in Philadelphia, 
which included the creation of the 
Elder Justice & Civil Resource Center 
that opened in 2016. Through the 
Center, volunteer attorneys and 
advocates provide direct services 
on legal issues as they relate to 
elders including training programs 
on landlord/tenant, mental health 
issues and financial exploitation. Since 
opening, the center has provided 
assistance to hundreds of elders and 
their families.

judges and court staff on elder abuse 
and exploitation, and has piloted 
training for family and lay guardians 
about their powers, duties and 
responsibilities. 

Furthermore, educational material 
including brochures and posters were 
created by the OEJC and distributed to 
all common pleas, magisterial district 
and municipal courts.

“The Advisory Council and OEJC are 
committed to increasing awareness 
about the warning signs of elder abuse 
and how to report it to help protect 
vulnerable elders in Pennsylvania,” said 
Director of the OEJC, Cherstin Hamel.

Education efforts

Best practices

As part of their continuing efforts 
to help educate judges, court staff, 
attorneys, guardians, the public and 
others about the warning signs of elder 
abuse, the Advisory Council and the 
OEJC have worked closely with the 
AOPC/Judicial Education team.

Together, they have developed and 
conducted statewide training programs 
for judges handling guardianship 
cases. In addition, the Advisory 
Council will be releasing (in early 2019) 
two judicial resources – a Guardian 
Benchbook and an Elder Abuse 
Benchbook. 

The OEJC has also developed and 
presented educational sessions for 

Numerous and significant best 
practices were adopted and 
implemented that will help ensure the 
protection of Pennsylvania’s elders 
– including the holding of periodic 
hearings to monitor the status of a 
guardianship, timely completion and 
filing of inventories and annual reports, 
the provision of oral and written 
instructions to guardians at their time 
of appointment.

While there is still work to be done, this 
report offers a moment of reflection on 
the magnitude and significance of the 
steps that are being taken to better 
protect Pennsylvania’s rapidly growing 
population of elders.

Martial arts for the 
mouth and mind
Treating people with dignity and respect 

The AOPC held its second 
largest webinar to date 
with over 200 employees 
participating. The hour-long 
webinar, “Verbal Judo” 
was led by Judicial District 
Security Analyst, Kyle 
Ramberger.

The webinar aimed to 
teach court staff how 
to appropriately and 
effectively handle verbal 
confrontation with the end 
goal of generating voluntary 
compliance.

Ramberger explained 
that the idea for the 
webinar stemmed from 
Judicial Security’s review 
of Pennsylvania Judicial 
Incident Reporting System 
(PAJIRS) reports, which 
indicated that the leading 
security incident court staff 
experienced over the past 
five years was inappropriate 
verbal conduct. 

“Once I learned this, I sought 
information on verbal conflict 
de-escalation techniques 
and verbal judo seemed 
to be the best option for 
our audience,” Ramberger 
explained. 

Verbal judo provides 
participants with the tools 
needed to defuse verbal 
aggression before it 
escalates.”

Additionally, the webinar 
included common phrases 
that people should refrain 
from using, along with 
alternative phrases that 
could help defuse the 
situation rather than escalate 
it.

The webinar was very well-
received and employees 
submitted positive feedback. 
A second verbal judo 
webinar will be offered in 
early 2019. 

Kyle Ramberger, Judicial District 
Security Analyst

The webinar concluded with 
a Q & A session, along with 
some security tips to use 
when verbal judo doesn’t 
work, reminding court staff 
to check their court duress 
systems monthly and to 
report all security incidents 
in PAJIRS. 

Five universal truths  
of human interaction

People feel the need 
to be respected 

People would rather 
be asked than told 

People have a desire 
to know why 

People prefer to have 
options over threats

People want to have 
a second chance 

Instead of saying:

“Come here!”

Try saying:

“Can we talk?”

Instead of saying:

“Calm down!”

Try saying:

“It’s going to 
be okay.”

Engaging with members of 
the transgender community 

Following a similar theme, the 
AOPC recently held a “Transgender 
Awareness” webinar that emphasized 
the importance of conveying respect 
and openness to everyone – being 
especially mindful of a person’s gender 
identity and expression.

It was organized by Judicial Programs 
Administrator Rick Pierce and was the 
largest AOPC webinar yet with over 
300 court staff participating statewide. 

The speakers and content for the 
presentation were provided by the 

Mazzoni Center in Philadelphia, a 
group that focuses on meeting the 
health and wellness needs of LGBTQ 
communities.  

The webinar focused on training court 
staff how to better understand and 
respectfully engage with members of 
the transgender community. 

The program presenters explained 
that when a person identifies with 
a different gender than their one 
assigned at birth, it causes an 
internal struggle; and to resolve this, 

it is important for them to be able to 
express the gender with which they 
identify.

However, this can only be 
accomplished when others understand 
and respect them – which is the 
ultimate goal behind these types of 
trainings. 

Some of the advice that the webinar 
gave court staff included:

•  Honor a person’s request to be 
called by a different name, even 
if it doesn’t match their legal 
documents; and 

• 

If you see a person being mocked 
or disrespected, make a correction 
or report it to someone who can.

12345Highlighting 
Black History 
Month in the 
courts
In honor of Black History 
Month, the AOPC interviewed 
several Pennsylvania judges 
to talk about what Black 
History Month means to 
each of them and how they 
approach diversity in the 
courtroom.

Saluting an 
impressive 
track record of 
court service

Major Tom Hargis is living proof that 
age is just a number. At 96 years old, 
Hargis works at the Dauphin County 
courthouse as a court clerk to Judge 
Jeannine Turgeon, Court of Common 
Pleas.

Born in a small town in Maryland, 
Hargis grew up during the Great 
Depression where his family got by 
through farming and share-cropping.

“After graduating from the Salisbury 
Colored High School, unemployment 
was extremely high and the only 
work available for the most part 
was farming work, which lead to my 
decision to volunteer for the U.S. 
Army on Feb. 12, 1941,” said Hargis. 

After Pearl Harbor, Hargis was 
deployed for special training in land 
and water amphibious vehicles in 
preparation for shipment into the 
Theater of Operations in the South 
Pacific. 

In 1944, Hargis participated in the 
landing of U.S. Forces as part of the 
Philippines Liberation invasion under 
the command of General MacArthur.

He served in the Army Reserve for 
many years until 1975 when he was 
honorably discharged with the rank 
of Major.

Major Tom Hargis and Judge Jeannine Turgeon

In 1988, Hargis started with Dauphin 
County in the Prothonotary’s office 
before moving to the Clerk of Court’s 
office, working in various judges’ 
courtrooms before being assigned to 
Judge Turgeon’s courtroom in 1992 – 
when he was pushing 70 years old. 

“He helped me learn my way,” said 
Judge Turgeon. “He drives to work 
every day – rain or shine, and has 
worked alongside me some nights 
until 8 or 9 p.m. With only a 15-minute 
break for lunch on crammed days, he 
has never once complained.”

“He is wise. He is kind. He is a team 
player,” added Judge Turgeon. “I 
admire him immensely and will 
be forever grateful to whomever 
assigned him to take care of me and 
my courtroom 27 years ago.”

Hargis has five children, and says that 
outside of work, he enjoys spending 
time with his family and gardening. 

This past November, Governor Tom 
Wolf sent Hargis a proclamation for 
his 96th birthday, thanking him for his 
dedicated service to both the country 
and the commonwealth.

Judge John Driscoll with newly adoptive family. Shirts read: Families don’t have to match when their hearts do.

Celebrating Adoption Day 
in Westmoreland County 

Westmoreland County courthouse was 
filled with lots of smiles and hugs as 
court staff celebrated Adoption Day in 
November the best way imaginable. 

After having been placed in the system 
when he was three years old, Ryan had 
been bounced around homes nearly 
22 times. 

Westmoreland County Common Pleas 
Judges John Driscoll and Jim Silvis 
oversaw the adoptions of eight happy 
children who found their permanent 
homes and forever families that day. 

“Child protection has such an 
enormous workload and occasionally, 
termination of parental rights must 
occur,” said Judge Driscoll. “It is sad 
and difficult when this happens, but 
National Adoption Day is a day filled 
with joy.” 

Among the many smiling faces in the 
courtroom was little Kareem, whose 
smile didn’t leave his face the whole 
hearing, while repeatedly asking, “Am I 
adopted yet?” 

Kareem was adopted by Jennifer and 
Dale Shawley, who had previously 
adopted his half-brother.

Another particularly moving story was 
that of a 17-year-old boy, Ryan Stokes.

“People don’t understand how hard it 
is to go through what we have,” Ryan 
said. “You just have to keep trying until 
you break through and get to know us. 
Once you get to know us, you’ll like 
us.”

Ryan’s adoptive mother, Barb Stokes, 
was the secretary at Ryan’s high school 
when she learned that he was going to 
be moved to yet another home. 

“I’ve had a good life, and it broke my 
heart to know he had gone through so 
much in life,” Barb said. “He deserved 
to have the same things in life that I’ve 
had.” 

Barb and her husband, Rob asked 
Ryan if he wanted to come live with 
them, and on Nov. 29, they officially 
welcomed him into their family.  

“Nearly half of the children in the 
Pennsylvania foster care system are 
teenagers,” said Director of the Office 

Rob, Ryan and Barb Stokes

of Children and Families in the Courts, 
Sandy Moore. 

While the goal initially is almost always 
to safely reunite a child with their bio-
logical family, when this is not possible, 
Pennsylvania law encourages anyone 
who knows and cares for a child to 
step forward and become that forever 
family.”

When asked how he was going to 
celebrate with his new family, Ryan 
said he was excited to take a trip to the 
beach this summer – something he’s 
never done. 

Having already been accepted to 
three colleges, Ryan has a bright 
future ahead of him, with plans to go to 
college for nursing.

pro bono work 

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
recently approved a three-year 
pilot program that began on Jan. 1, 
2019, allowing attorneys to receive 
Continuing Legal Education (CLE) 
credits in exchange for offering their 
legal services pro bono.

Registered, active Pennsylvania 
attorneys can receive one CLE credit 
for every five hours of pro bono 
work they complete with a legal aid 
organization that has been approved 
by the Pennsylvania Continuing Legal 
Education Board. 

The pilot program allows attorneys 
to receive a maximum of three CLE 
credits annually.

Additionally, the Supreme Court 
adopted a new rule last May that 
allows retired attorneys to volunteer 
their services pro bono under a new 
“emeritus” status. 

“It used to be that you couldn’t practice 
once you’re retired, but this new 
emeritus status allows retired attorneys 
the ability to continue practicing, while 
performing a much-needed service to 

Dan Levering and Katey Buggy

low-income Pennsylvanians,” said Dan 
Levering, CLE Board administrator. 

Attorneys under this status will only 
have to complete eight annual CLE 
credits instead of the standard 12 
credits that are required for active 
attorneys. 

Prior to applying for emeritus status, 
retired attorneys must complete six 
hours of continuing legal education 
within a year of submitting their 
application to the Office of Attorney 
Registration. 

“Emeritus status and the CLE for pro 
bono pilot project are important Court 
initiatives we have been happy to be 
involved with,” added Katey Buggy, 
CLE Board associate administrator.  

They are an example of using goals of 
the CLE Board to connect lawyers with 
legal service providers and hopefully 
boost pro bono participation.”

New rule provides direction to attorneys  
with unclaimed funds in their IOLTA account 

For several years, the IOLTA Board has received calls from 
attorneys seeking guidance on the ethical distribution of 
unclaimed and unidentifiable funds in their IOLTA trust 
account. 

This is an especially common question when an attorney is 
winding down a law practice in preparation for retirement 
or when his or her attempts to contact a former client are 
unsuccessful. 

Fortunately, Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 
1.15(v) was recently adopted and will be able to provide this 
necessary guidance. 

The new rule provides that after reasonable efforts have 
been undertaken to reunite funds in an IOLTA account with 

their rightful owner for at least two years, any unidentifiable 
or unclaimed funds may be transferred to the IOLTA Board 
for safekeeping. 

The funds may be reclaimed if the rightful owner is identified 
or located at a later time.

Directing unclaimed and unidentifiable funds to the IOLTA 
Board advances the mission of funding civil legal assistance 
for low-income and disadvantaged Pennsylvanians since the 
beneficial interest from the funds remains a source of legal 
aid funding.

l to r: Conference attendees at Crowne Plaza in Harrisburg, Drug Court Commissioner Judge Peggy Davis from Greene County, Missouri

Mental health courts:
Changing the face of criminal  
justice and changing lives 

Pennsylvania’s problem-solving courts 
held their first statewide mental health 
courts training this past December 
during a two-day conference at the 
Crowne Plaza in Harrisburg.

Over 125 people attended the 
conference sponsored by AOPC with 
almost every mental health court in the 
state represented. 

The conference agenda included 
a wide range of keynote speakers 
including mental health researchers 
and advocates, as well as experienced 
problem-solving court judges and 
program administrators from across the 
country. 

“The purpose of this training was for 
our teams to gain the valuable insight 
and advice that these speakers had to 
offer, and to take that back and apply 
it in their own courts,” said Angela 
Sobol Lowry, problem-solving courts 
administrator.

Among the many training topics 
covered at the conference was 
Motivational Interviewing, led by Drug 

Court Commissioner, Judge Peggy 
Davis from Greene County, Missouri.

“In order to get a 

defendant to change 

their behavior, you 

have to understand 

and explore their own 

personal motivations,”  

said Judge Davis.

“Rehabilitation is the paramount 
purpose of sentencing for most people, 
and judges can begin and support 
this process by adopting Motivational 
Interviewing methods,” said Judge 
Davis. 

Judge Davis explained that the overall 
goal of all problem-solving courts is 
to get the defendant to change their 
behavior, and defendants are far 
more likely to change when they are 
motivated to do so. 

She shared some of her own 
experiences using Motivational 
Interviewing methods, and 
demonstrated effective rebuttal 
statements for court staff to use when 
talking to defendants who are resistant 
to changing their behavior. 

Some of these methods include:

•  Asking a person’s permission to give 

feedback before responding

•  Acknowledging what a person has 

said while pointing out contradictory 
statements 

•  Helping relate a person’s past 

success/challenges to their present 
efforts to change.

Judge Davis concluded the 
presentation by commending court 
staff for the important work they do.

“Drug addiction, mental health issues— 
these are battles; and you all should be 
proud to help fight this battle.”

Retired Chief Justice Flaherty dies at 87

Chief Justice Emeritus John P. Flaherty 
passed away on Feb. 20, 2019, after a 
five-year battle with Alzheimer’s disease. 
He died at age 87 in his home in Indiana 
Township. 

Justice Flaherty received his bachelor’s 
degree from Duquesne University and his 
law degree from the University of Pittsburgh 
School of Law. In 1953, he enlisted in the Army 
and served for two years. He then opened a 
private practice in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania 
prior to being elected to Allegheny County 
Common Pleas Court in 1973.

In 1979, Flaherty was appointed to fill 
an interim six-month term on the state 
Supreme Court before winning a full 10-year 
term and retention twice. He became Chief 
Justice in 1996 and served in that role until 
his retirement in 2001.

“Justice Flaherty’s tenure marked a time 
of healing for the court as he stepped into 
the role of mediator and encouraged his 
colleagues to speak with one voice,” said 
Court Administrator of Pennsylvania  
Thomas B. Darr.
