      <pre>PENNSYLVANIA RULES OF JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION

DISABILITY AND LANGUAGE ACCESS 

DISABILITY ACCESS 

Rule 250. Policy 

Rule 251. Scope 

It is the policy of the Unified Judicial System (UJS) to prohibit discrimination 

against any individual  with a disability, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq., in accessing or participating in judicial
 proceedings or other services, programs, or activities of the UJS. 

These rules shall apply to each UJS entity which includes, but is not limited to, all 

appellate courts, judicial districts, boards, committees, and agencies under the 
administrative authority of the Supreme Court. These rules relating to reasonable 
accommodations under Title II of the ADA do not supersede either the requirements of 
42 Pa.C.S. §§ 4401 et seq., relating to Court Interpreters for Persons Who Are Deaf or 
Hard of Hearing, or the Administrative Regulations Governing Language Access for 
Persons with Limited English Proficiency and for Persons Who Are Deaf or Hard of 
Hearing, 204 Pa. Code §§ 221.101 et seq. 

Note: The Administrative Regulations  Governing Language Access for Persons 

with Limited English Proficiency and for Persons Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (204 
Pa. Code §§ 221.101 et seq.) and 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 4401 et seq. provide standards for 
court interpreters in judicial proceedings. “Judicial proceeding” is defined, in pertinent 
part, as “an ‘action,’ ‘appeal’ or ‘proceeding’ in any court of this Commonwealth.” 2 
Pa.C.S. § 101. Title II of the ADA requires an interpreter for the deaf or hard of hearing 
for all programs, services, or activities of the UJS. See 42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 
35.160. 

Rule 252.  Reasonable Accommodations 

A.

B.

Each UJS entity shall develop a written policy to receive and process
requests for reasonable accommodations from individuals  with disabilities.
The policy shall be posted on the UJS website, each UJS entity’s respective
website, and in each courthouse and office in the court system.

All policies developed must be substantially similar to the policy appended
to this Rule (Appendix A) and shall contain, at a minimum, the following
elements:

1. Appointment of an ADA  coordinator – the coordinator must be identified

 

on  all  court or program materials  and  the  following  information  shall  be 
provided:  the coordinator’s  name, work address, work  fax number  or e-
mail address, and work telephone number. 

2. Notice of the right to request free accommodation(s).

3. Explanation of the process for requesting accommodation(s).

4. Timeline for request and response.

C.

D.

Each UJS entity shall develop a form substantially similar to the one
appended to this rule (Appendix A) for processing requests for reasonable
accommodations.

Each UJS entity shall adopt and publish a grievance procedure,
substantially similar to the procedure appended to this rule (Appendix B),
for requests that have been denied in whole or in part. Any denial of an
accommodation request based upon undue burden or fundamental
alteration to services and programs shall be put in writing by the head of
the entity or his or her designee and shall provide specific reasons for the
denial.

Note:  In  2014,  each  UJS  entity  was  required  to  provide  the  Administrative 
Office  with  a  copy  of  their  ADA  policy  and  form  and  their  grievance  procedure  and 
form, as outlined in sections A-D above.    

APPENDIX A - Sample policy and forms 
APPENDIX B - Sample grievance procedure including form

 

APPENDIX A  

   

AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (TITLE II) POLICY 

he Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania (UJS) complies with Title II of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which provides that “no qualified individual 
with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation 
in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public 
entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity”.  42 U.S.C.A. §12132.  
Pursuant to that requirement, if you are an individual with a disability who needs 
an accommodation in order to participate in any judicial proceeding or any other 
service, program, or activity of the UJS, you are entitled, at no cost to you, to the 
provision of certain assistance.  The ADA does not require the (UJS entity name 
here) to take any action that would fundamentally alter the nature of its programs 
or services, or impose an undue financial or administrative burden. 
  
If you require an accommodation under the ADA, it is recommended that you 
make your request as soon as possible or at least three (3) business days before 
your scheduled participation in any court proceeding or UJS program or activity.  
All requests for accommodation, regardless of timeliness, will be given due 
consideration and if necessary, may require an interactive process between the 
requestor and the (name of UJS entity) to determine the best course of action.  
  
To request a reasonable accommodation, please complete the Request for 
Reasonable Accommodation Form (Appendix B) and return it to: 

ame(s), Business Address(es), Fax Number(s) and / or e-mail address(es), 

Telephone Number(s) of the ADA Coordinator 

f you need assistance completing this form, contact the ADA Coordinator.   
Complaints alleging violations of Title II under the ADA may be filed pursuant to 
the UJS Grievance Procedure with (name and contact information of individual 
who handles grievance procedures).  A response will be sent to you after careful 
review of the facts.
