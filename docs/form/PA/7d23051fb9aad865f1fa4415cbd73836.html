AKEETA THOMPSON       

 

Appellant 

 No. 470 WDA 2022 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered November 16, 2021 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-02-CR-0002589-2021 

EFORE:  OLSON, J., NICHOLS, J., and PELLEGRINI, J.* 

MEMORANDUM BY PELLEGRINI, J.:  

 

FILED:  March 16, 2023 

 

This case is about “Tito,” a missing chihuahua.  Following a bench trial, 

Zakeeta  Thompson  (Thompson)  was  found  guilty  by  the  Court  of  Common 

Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court) of one count of theft by unlawful taking 

because  she  had  “lost”  the  canine  right  after  rescuing  him  from  deplorable 

living conditions in her sister’s home.  Thompson argues on appeal that the 

conviction cannot stand because the evidence of her criminal intent was legally 

insufficient, and the Commonwealth now concedes error on that point.  As we, 

too, find merit in the claim, the judgment of sentence must be vacated. 

The underlying facts of this case are undisputed.  On the day in question, 

Thompson went to the apartment of her sister, Sequoia Burkes.  Thompson

had been caring for Burkes’ two young children for over a week while Burkes 

was being hospitalized to treat an undisclosed mental illness. 

Burkes  was  not  at  home  when  Thompson  arrived  there  to  deliver  the 

two children.  The apartment was locked, but Thompson attempted to enter 

out of concern for Burkes’ safety.  Thompson called the security service for 

the  apartment  complex,  requesting  a  wellness  check,  and  three  security 

guards responded, including Dale Miller, who would later testify at Thompson’s 

trial. 

Once  the  security  guards  arrived,  Thompson  crawled  into  the  home 

through a window and unlocked the front door so that the guards could enter.  

They saw that Burkes was not home, but noticed that the dog, Tito, was alone 

there.  Thompson and the security guards were alarmed because no food or 

water had been left for the dog.  Even more concerning was the fact that items 

of garbage and cleaning chemicals had spilled onto the floor in areas where 

the  dog  could  come  into  contact  with  them.    The  security guards  described 

the apartment as uninhabitable.  See Trial Transcript, 11/16/2021, at p. 13. 

In the presence of the three security guards, Thompson took the animal 

with  her  as  she  left  Burkes’  apartment.    According  to  Thompson,  she  then 

returned to her own home and began removing one of Burkes’ children from 

a  car  seat  –  while  she  was  holding  the  child,  a  newborn,  the  dog  suddenly 

jumped out of the vehicle and ran away.  Thompson was unable to locate him. 

- 2 - 

J-A06033-23 

On several occasions over the next few days, Thompson called Burkes 

to tell her about the dog, but to no avail.  Three days after incident, the dog’s 

owner,  Fowler-Green,  called  the  police.    Fowler-Green  stated  that  he  had 

temporarily left Tito with Burkes to lift her spirits following her hospitalization, 

and that he had contacted the police as soon as he learned that the dog was 

missing.  The three-day interlude between the loss of the dog and the police 

report was never explained. 

Officer Jake  Flickinger investigated Tito’s disappearance and he called 

Thompson to inquire about the dog’s whereabouts.  Officer Flickinger testified 

at the trial that he was unable to remember much of the conversation, but he 

vaguely recalled that Thompson abruptly hung up the phone after saying she 

had “no idea” what he was referring to when asked about the dog.  After that 

call, Officer Flickinger charged Thompson with theft. 

Thompson,  in  turn,  denied  Officer  Flickinger’s  characterization  of  her 

responses.  She testified that the officer was hostile during the call, and that 

she only told him that she did not have possession of the dog.  When asked 

at the trial why she did not report the dog missing or take any steps to retrieve 

him,  Thompson  stated  that  she  had  made  several  futile  attempts  to  inform 

Burkes, but that her sister had refused to respond. 

Thompson pointed out further that it would not have been practical for 

her to find the dog or report it missing because she did not know its name or 

who owned it, and she did not discuss losing the dog with Officer Flickinger 

- 3 - 

J-A06033-23 

because his hostile tone made it seem unlikely that he would be helpful in that 

regard.  Moreover, Thompson stated that she would have had no reason to 

steal the dog for herself. 

At the conclusion of the trial, defense counsel moved for judgment of 

acquittal,  arguing  that  no  evidence  had  been  presented  showing  that 

Thompson had an intent to permanently deprive Fowler-Green of his dog.  The 

trial court denied the motion and found Thompson guilty of theft by taking, 

inferring  the  requisite  criminal  intent  from  Thompson’s  failure  to  locate  the 

dog after it ran away: 

You opened the door.  He runs away, and you say to yourself, oh 
well. I have an infant, and I have another kid.  Nothing I can do.  
Oh, well.  Then you don’t tell the police so the police can make an 
effort and at least tell the owner, here is what happened to your 
dog.  I find the whole thing appalling and disgraceful, and I find 
you guilty. 
 

Trial Transcript, 11/16/2021, at p. 53. 

At sentencing, Thompson apologized for losing the dog and again denied 

that  she  did  so  intentionally.    The  trial  court  acknowledged  that  Thompson 

may  not  have  lost  the  dog  on  purpose,  but  she  was  nevertheless  found 

criminally liable because the loss of the dog was “the result of [her] actions.”  

Id. at p. 55.  Thompson was found guilty and sentenced to probation for a 

period  of  two  years.    She  was  also  directed  to  pay  $1,200  in  restitution  to 

Fowler-Green. 

Thompson  filed  a  post-sentence  motion  for  judgment  of  acquittal  in 

which  she  contended  that  the  evidence  of  criminal  intent  was  legally

insufficient.  The trial court denied the motion and Thompson timely filed an 

appeal.  In its 1925(a) opinion, the trial court reiterated that the conviction 

should be upheld because Thompson’s intent to deprive Fowler-Green of his 

dog could be inferred from Thompson’s evasive answers when first contacted 

by police: 

Ms. Thompson may have intended to remove Tito from her sister’s 
residence because she did not think it was a safe location for the 
dog.  She may not have intended that the dog become lost, as she 
claimed  Tito  was.    Ms.  Thompson,  however,  did  intend  to 
permanently  deprive  Tito’s  rightful  owner  of  him,  despite  her 
incredible testimony to the contrary.  Such a conclusion was clear 
to  the  Court  based  on  Ms.  Thompson’s  testimony  and  Officer 
Flickinger’s testimony that Ms. Thompson, in response to inquiry 
about Tito, denied knowing “what [he] was talking about and hung 
up on [him].” 
 

Trial Court Opinion, at 5 (internal citations omitted). 

 

Thompson  argues  in  her  appellate  brief  that  her  conversation  with 

Officer  Flickinger  was  not  probative  of  her  intent  in  removing  Tito  from  her 

sister’s house.  The Commonwealth suggests that Thompson should have tried 

harder to find the dog after allowing him to escape, but in substance agrees 

that Thompson’s conduct does amount to a crime.   See Appellee’s Brief, at 

14-15. 

 “Whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict is a question 

of law; our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.”  

Commonwealth v. Murray, 83 A.3d 137, 151 (Pa. 2013).   In reviewing a 

sufficiency  challenge,  we  determine  “whether  the  evidence  at  trial,  and  all 

reasonable  inferences  derived  therefrom,  when  viewed  in  the  light  most 

- 5 - 

favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to establish 

all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Commonwealth v. 

May, 887 A.2d 750, 753 (Pa. 2005). 

“Further,  a  conviction  may  be  sustained  wholly  on  circumstantial 

evidence,  and  the  trier  of  fact  –  while  passing  on  the  credibility  of  the 

witnesses and the weight of the evidence – is free to believe all, part, or none 

of the evidence.”  Commonwealth v. Miller, 172 A.3d 632, 640 (Pa. Super. 

2017).    “In  conducting  this  review,  the  appellate  court  may  not  weigh  the 

evidence and substitute its judgment for the fact-finder.”  Id.  The “disbelief 

of a denial does not, taken alone, afford affirmative proof that the denied fact 

existed  so  as  to  satisfy  a  proponent’s  burden  of  proving  that  fact.”  

Commonwealth  v.  Torres,  766  A.2d  342,  345  (Pa.  2001)  (quoting 

Commonwealth v. Graham, 596 A.2d 1117, 1118 (Pa. 1991)). 

A  person  commits  the  offense  of  theft  “if  [s]he  unlawfully  takes,  or 

exercises unlawful control over, moveable property of another with intent to 

deprive  him  thereof.”    18  Pa.C.S.  §  3921(a).    For  the  purposes  of  Section 

(1)  To  withhold  property  of  another  permanently  or  for  so 
extended  a  period  as  to  appropriate  a  major  portion  of  its 
economic  value  or  with  intent  to  restore  only  upon  payment  of 
reward or other compensation; 

2) to dispose of the property so as to make it unlikely that the 
owner will recover it.

J-A06033-23 

 

In the present case, the Commonwealth charged Thompson with theft 

because she removed a dog from an uninhabitable residence.  The trial court 

seemed to accept that Thompson did not intend to steal the dog at that point, 

but found her  guilty of theft  because she did  not report the animal missing 

and  she  denied  having  knowledge  of  what  Officer  Flickinger  “was  talking 

about” when he called her during his investigation. 

 

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, 

we  find  that  Thompson’s  intent  to  steal  the  dog  was  not  proven  beyond  a 

reasonable  doubt.    Thompson  first  discovered  the  dog  unexpectedly  when 

performing  a  wellness  check  on  her  sister,  who  had  been  suffering  from  a 

mental illness.  In the presence of three security guards, she then took the 

dog with her, along with her sister’s two children, to protect the animal from 

potentially lethal conditions in her sister’s home.  The trial court recognized 

that up until that point, Thompson was “trying to do the  right thing.”   Trial 

Transcript, 11/16/2021, at p. 53. 

 

The two facts which the trial court found critical – Thompson’s perceived 

lack of effort in recovering the dog and her denials to an officer – do not prove 

criminal intent.  Allowing the dog to escape and doing little to find it was, at 

most,  negligent,  but  it  does  not  establish  that  Thompson  ever  intended  to 

permanently deprive Fowler-Green of his dog at the time of the taking.  To 

the  contrary,  the  Commonwealth’s  witnesses  corroborated  that  Thompson 

only wanted to remove the dog from the home for its own safety.

Thompson’s conversation with Officer Flickinger also does not establish 

an intent to deprive an owner of property under Section 3921(a).  The officer 

testified at trial that he did not remember much of the exchange.  However, 

even if Thompson did falsely deny having knowledge of the incident, it would 

still not prove that she intended to commit a theft.  See Torres, 766 A.2d at 

345.   Again, it was unrefuted that she initially tried to rescue the dog from 

starvation and poisoning. 

As  Thompson  argues  and  as  the  Commonwealth  wisely  concedes,  no 

reasonable  inference  from  Thompson’s  conduct  after  the  rescue  of  the  dog 

establishes  that  a  theft  occurred.    Thus,  because  the  evidence  was  legally 

insufficient to sustain Thompson’s conviction, the judgment of sentence must
