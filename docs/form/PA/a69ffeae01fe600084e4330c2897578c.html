Pennsylvania’s Statewide Case Management Systems
The centralization of data and documents in statewide case management systems 
provides for sharing of court information across jurisdictions and court-related 
entities. The result is more consistent practices, the creation of programs and 
initiatives based on standardized data, and promotion of a uniform system of justice. 

Magisterial District Judge System (MDJS) –  
a comprehensive statewide case management system 
that serves all Magisterial District Courts, including central 
and night courts and the Pittsburgh Municipal Court. 

Common Pleas Case Management System (CPCMS) –  
provides case management, accounting and reporting 
functions to the criminal division of the Courts of Common 
Pleas, and to dependency and delinquency cases.

Pennsylvania Appellate Court Case Management 
System (PACMS) – a statewide case management system 
used by the three appellate courts – Supreme, Superior 
and Commonwealth.

Pennsylvania was the second state in the country to automate all appellate courts on 
a single statewide case management system. 

Pennsylvania was the first state in the country to automate  
any level of court on a single statewide case management system.

data from AOPC’s three statewide case management systems. They also provide data 
to AOPC’s justice partners through JNET.   

In 2019, AOPC/IT staff processed 664 such requests. Analysts review each request and 
work to develop the datasets that will be provided to requesters from the public, 
the legislature, other government agencies and the media. A few of these services
