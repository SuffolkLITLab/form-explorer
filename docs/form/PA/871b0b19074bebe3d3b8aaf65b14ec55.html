      <pre>1.When a Confidential Information Form is used, the confidential 

information (e.g., social security and financial account numbers) is listed 
on the Form and not in the body of the motion, pleading, or other 
document being filed with the court.  What is accessible to the public?  

nswer: The Confidential Information Form is not accessible to the 

public.  However, the motion, etc. (which has no confidential information) 
is available to the public.   
 

2.How do the requirements in Section 7.0 affect self-represented parties? 

nswer: Self-represented parties must comply with the Policy or face 

possible sanctions.  The Policy and related forms can be found at 
https://www.pacourts.us/public-records.    
 

3.Section 7 (D): How do I comply with the required certification when e-filing 
my documents with a court?  When filing my documents in paper form? 

nswer: With regard to e-filing, in PACFile (the statewide e-filing system), 

there is a “checkbox” that contains the certification that filers have to 
check in order to e-file their documents.  Some judicial districts may also 
have implemented a similar e-filing procedure; if you have questions, it is 
advised that you check with the pertinent filing office. 

hen filing your documents in paper form, the Confidential Information 
Form or Confidential Document Form contain the required certification.  
In addition, many party-filed forms in the Magisterial District Judge 
System (MDJS) also include the required certification.   

he AOPC has also created a sample Certification Form that parties, and 

attorneys may use as a stand-alone document or incorporate in their 
filed documents.  All Policy forms may be viewed at

Frequently Asked Questions – Case Records Public Access Policy of the 
Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania  

Section 7.0: 

The following questions and answers are provided for general information only and may not be 
completely accurate in every circumstance.  This information is not legal advice and is not intended to 
be legally binding upon Unified Judicial System courts or offices.  Please consider contacting the relevant 
court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

   

4.The requirements of Section 7.0 apply to all documents for any case filed 
with a court or custodian (except for cases sealed or exempted from 
public access pursuant to legal authority) on or after the effective date of 
this policy.  Does this mean that all documents filed before the Policy 
was effective are not governed by the Policy but might be protected by a 
pre-existing policy or rule?  

nswer: Sections 7.0 (Confidential Information) and 8.0 (Confidential 
Documents) are not applicable to documents filed with a court prior to 
the effective date of the Policy.  To the extent that there were policies and 
rules in place that protected information or documents prior to that date, 
then they would govern documents filed before this Policy took effect. 
  

5.What happens when a case that was previously sealed pursuant to a court 

order is unsealed? 

Answer: A court on its own motion or upon a party’s motion may direct 
that confidential information/documents contained in the previous 
filings be protected in accordance with the Policy.  It is advised that 
parties and attorneys take all necessary actions during the pendency of a 
case to protect confidential information and documents, to avoid having 
to take action retroactively should a case be unsealed.   

6.What if a court order or opinion contains confidential information?  Who 

has the burden of redacting confidential information on routine 
scheduling orders or opinions issued by the courts? 

nswer: Court-generated documents, such as hearing notices, orders 

and opinions, are not governed by Section 7.0, or by the Policy in 
general.  The Policy governs documents filed with the court by a party or 
attorney.  For more information, you may wish to read the Commentary 
to Sections 7.0 and 8.0 of the Policy.   

he courts are not required to redact their opinions or other court-

generated documents.  It is important that the public has access to and 
an understanding of the courts' decisions, in order to assure that justice 
is being done fairly and impartially as well as to promote confidence in 
the judicial system.

The following questions and answers are provided for general information only and may not be 
completely accurate in every circumstance.  This information is not legal advice and is not intended to 
be legally binding upon Unified Judicial System courts or offices.  Please consider contacting the relevant 
court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

 

 

   

7.When a court order containing information which must be safeguarded 

pursuant to Section 7.0 is attached to a party filing, should the order be 
redacted?   

nswer: The Policy does not impact court-generated documents, such as 

court orders and notices.  Thus, if the order is available to the public in 
the file, the party attaching the order to the filing does not need to 
comply with the Section 7.0 protocols.  
 

8.Under Section 7.0(A)(5), will the court include children’s names and dates 
of birth in custody orders?  Related to this specific question is the more 
general question about how the court intends to issue orders, opinions, 
judgments, or decrees so that confidential information is protected.  

Answer: Section 7.0(A)(5) does not apply to court-generated documents 
(orders, opinions, etc.).   

9.Currently our county does not place custody records online, does the 

Policy obligate a county to now put them online? 

Answer: There is no requirement to place records online. 

10.A custody case is filed, and the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has a 
specific mental health issue (e.g., bipolar disorder) and should not be 
awarded custody of the children.  Can the pleading reference the mental 
health issue or must any reference to the issue be redacted? 

Answer: Medical records are documents safeguarded by Section 
8.0(A)(3).  However, Section 7.0 does not list medical information as a 
piece of information that requires protection.  There is no requirement 
under the Policy to redact or safeguard the mental health issue 
mentioned in the pleading. 

However, attorneys should be mindful of the Rules of Professional 
Conduct that requires care in protecting the confidential information of 
clients (Rule 1.6) and competent representation (Rule 1.1).

court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

   

11.When is an individual considered an "abuse victim" for purposes of 

redacting their address?  

Answer: An abuse victim is defined in the Policy as “a person for whom a 
protection order has been granted by a court pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 
1901 et seq. and 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6101 et seq. or Pa.R.Civ.P. 1951 et seq. 
and 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 62A01 et seq., as well as Pa.R.Civ.P.M.D.J. 1201 et 
seq.” See Section 1.0 (Definitions) of the Policy (emphasis added).    

12.When an abuse victim (as defined in the Policy) files a custody complaint, 
he/she will enter contact information on the Confidential Information 
Form.  When the custody complaint is served upon the defendant and 
the defendant is the “abuser”, should the Confidential Information Form 
- Abuse Victim Addendum be provided to the defendant as well? 

nswer: The Abuse Victim Addendum, and any additional pages, shall 

only be provided to the court and shall remain confidential. 
 

13.Will the petitions created in the State Police's Protection from Abuse 

Database (PFAD) be altered to comply with the Policy? 

nswer: A party filing a petition for protection must comply with the 

requirements of Section 7.0 and ensure that any confidential information 
is only set forth on the Confidential Information Form.   

14.How do I handle Confidential Information, such as a victim's address, 
included in Protection from Abuse petitions and Protection from Abuse 
orders? 

nswer: A party filing a petition for protection must comply with the 

requirements of Section 7.0 and ensure that any confidential information 
is only set forth on the Confidential Information Form.  However, the 
court-generated documents, such as court orders, are exempt from 
Section 7.0.

15.Do all Protection From Abuse Orders need to be filed with a Confidential 

Information Form?   

nswer: No.  Court-generated documents (such as a Protection From 

Abuse Order) are exempt from Section 7.0.    
 

16.Does a hearing notice which includes information about witnesses and 
abuse victims in family law cases need to be filed with a Confidential 
Information Form?    

nswer: No.  Hearing notices are court-generated documents which are 

exempt from Section 7.0.

17.Regarding Section 7.0(A)(6) relating to abuse victims—how would the 

Domestic Relations Office know that someone is an abuse victim and not 
include address information in court generated notices and filings? 

Answer: Court generated documents are exempt from Section 7.0.   

18.The PFA order expired two years ago and is no longer in effect, is the 
abuse victim, under the above definition, protected under Section 
7.0(A)(6)? 

Answer: No.  One is only an abuse victim for purposes of the Policy if 
there is a current order in effect when the document in a family court 
action is filed with the court. 

19.Orders in child support entered by the Domestic Relations Office contain 
a child's name & date of birth—under Section 7(A)(6) of the Policy, is 
there a requirement to change what is displayed in the order?   

Answer: No.  

20.When filing a petition for expungement pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 490 or 
790, should the social security number be protected in accordance with 
Section 7.0? 

Answer: A party filing a petition for expungement must comply with the 
requirements of Section 7.0 and ensure that any confidential information 
is only set forth on the Confidential Information Form.

completely accurate in every circumstance.  This information is not legal advice and is not intended to 
be legally binding upon Unified Judicial System courts or offices.  Please consider contacting the relevant 
court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

 

   

21.How does Section 7.0 reconcile with the requirements of what is to be 

included on the Complaint for Child Support, per Pa.R.Civ.P. 1920.27? 

Answer: Pleadings in child support matters maintained by the Domestic 
Relations Office are not accessible by the public, except for PACSES 
dockets, court orders and opinions as provided by legal authority; for 
more information, please review the Limits on Public Access to Unified 
Judicial System Case Records chart. 

22.How should parties, attorneys or judges differentiate between the 

children, if parties and attorneys refer to them as child 1, child 2, etc.? 
Or when all children share the same initials?     

Answer: Section 7.0(A)(5) prohibits the use of minor’s name and date of 
birth except when a minor is charged as a defendant in a criminal 
matter.  The court could require that parties and attorneys use a 
combination of initials and perhaps partial date of birth (e.g. year of 
birth).  Courts may wish to set local protocols for purposes of consistency 
and ease of administration.   

23.Can a party to the case view the confidential information of the other

provisions? 

party? 

  A

Answer: A party’s or attorney’s failure to comply with the policy will not 
affect access to case records that are otherwise accessible. Depending 
upon the provision of the Policy violated, a court of record may order the 
noncompliant filing to be sealed, redacted, amended, impose sanction or 
any combination thereof.  A magisterial district court may order the 
document to be sealed, redacted, and amended.

The following questions and answers are provided for general information only and may not be 
completely accurate in every circumstance.  This information is not legal advice and is not intended to 
be legally binding upon Unified Judicial System courts or offices.  Please consider contacting the relevant 
court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

 

   

   

25.Does the new policy apply to transcripts? 

Answer: Rule of Judicial Administration 4014 (Redaction of Personal 
Data Identifiers) is the authority for safeguarding confidential 
information in a transcript, which is a court-generated document. 

26.Why is a State Identification Number confidential under Section 7.0? 

Answer: State Identification Numbers (“SID”) have been defined as "[a] 
unique number  assigned to each individual whose fingerprints are 
placed into the Central Repository of  the State Police.  The SID is used to 
track individuals for crimes which they commit, no matter how many 
subsequent fingerprint cards are submitted." 37 Pa. Code § 58.1.   

The UJS' Electronic Case Record Public Access Policy also restricts public 
access to SIDs.  See also, Warrington Crew v.  Pa. Dept. of Corrections, (Pa. 
Cmwlth., No. 1006 C.D. 2010, filed Nov. 19, 2010), pertaining to a ruling 
by the Office of Open Records that a SID is exempt from disclosure 
through a right-to-know request because such numbers qualify  as a 
confidential personal identification number. 

27.If an attorney has been filing documents with a court that are not 

compliant with the Policy, what should the attorney do?   

nswer: The attorney should take corrective action, or risk sanctions 

and possible ethical violations. 

1.What should an individual do when they have a “Confidential Document” 
that must be submitted to the court, but the document is not listed on 
the form? Which box should they check? 

Answer: The Confidential Document Form should only be used for the 
“Confidential Documents” specifically listed in Section 8.0 of the Policy.  
If the document is not listed in Section 8.0, it is not a confidential 
document under the Policy.  If a party is concerned about the public

accessing a document not listed in Section 8.0, the party could request 
that the court seal the document.  

2.What about Petitions for Wrongful Death Actions that have medical 

records attached to them and other related confidential information?   

nswer: Section 8.0 requires that medical records be filed under a 

Confidential Document Form.   
 

3.Should a Mental Health Petition be filed under a Confidential Document 

Form? 

  A

  A

nswer: In matters involving an individual who is in treatment under the 

Mental Health Procedures Act, access to those matters is limited 
pursuant to 50 P.S. § 7111.  In fact, this statutory restriction is 
referenced in a chart created by the AOPC entitled Limits on Public 
Access to Unified Judicial System Case Records.  
 

4.Are Qualified Domestic Relations Orders considered confidential 

documents under the Policy? 

Answer: These are court orders and not governed by the Policy.   

5.What is considered an agreement between parties under 23 Pa.C.S. § 

3105 in Section 8.0(A)(7)? 

Answer: 23 Pa.C.S. § 3105(A) provides “[a] party to an agreement 
regarding matters within the jurisdiction of the court under this part, 
whether or not the agreement has been merged or incorporated into the 
decree, may utilize a remedy or sanction set forth in this part to enforce 
the agreement to the same extent as though the agreement had been an 
order of the court except as provided to the contrary in the agreement 
[emphasis added].  The jurisdiction of the court can be found under 23 
Pa.C.S. § 3104 and provides the court with jurisdiction over cases of 
divorce, including decrees and orders.  This can include property 
settlement agreements (PSA), separation agreements, custody 
stipulations, marriage settlement agreements, and under 23 Pa.C.S. § 
3104(a)(5) “[a]ny other matters pertaining to the marriage and divorce or 
annulment authorized by law….”

1.Will guardianships be public unless the court directs otherwise? 

Answer: Access to guardianship cases is limited in Section 9.0 to only 
orders finding a person incapacitated and the docket.  
 

2.Is the decree for an emergency petition for guardianship available to the 

Answer: Section 9.0(B) provides with regard to guardianship/incapacity 
proceedings that only the “docket and any final decree adjudicating a 
person as incapacitated” are available to the public.  With the public 
having access to the docket, the public would be able to see that an 
emergency petition has been filed and that a decree has been entered 
granting the petition.  The public could always petition the court to 
access more information.   
 

3.Under Section 9.0(B), the public is only permitted to see the docket and 

final decree adjudicating a person as incapacitated.  If a distant friend or 
family member wishes to review the file would they have to petition the 
court? 

nswer: Under the Policy, the guardian, party to the case, and the 

attorney of record may review the file.  Other individuals would need to 
petition the court.  The Policy does not intend to stop friends or family 
from taking care of their loved ones in guardianship matters.  The Policy 
is in place to protect the confidential information found in guardian 
matters from members of the public who have no reason to need that 
confidential information or have access to it. 
 

4.How does the Policy impact the public’s access to child support records 

maintained by the Domestic Relations Office? 

Answer: Access to the child support records would still be the same.  No 
public access, except for PACSES dockets, court orders and opinions as 
provided by legal authority; for more information please review the Limits 
on Public Access to Unified Judicial System Case Records.

be legally binding upon Unified Judicial System courts or offices.  Please consider contacting the relevant 
court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

   

5.Section 9.0(H) provides that “[t]he Unredacted Version of any document 

filed in accordance with prior versions of this policy [shall not be 
accessible to the public].”  Does this mean that all unredacted 
documents filed with a court are not accessible to the public or only 
those unredacted documents filed with the court since this Policy took 
effect in January of 2018? 

Answer: Only those unredacted documents filed with a court since the 
Policy took effect are impacted by Section 9.0(H).  From January 6, 2018 
until January 1, 2022, an appellate or trial court could permit the filing 
of any document in two versions, a “Redacted Version” and “Unredacted 
version,” rather than require the use of a Confidential Information Form, 
to safeguard the information identified in Section 7.0(A).  Beginning 
January 1, 2022, the Confidential Information Form became the single 
statewide method to safeguard that information.     

 

Section 10.0: 

1.Section 10.0 limits remote access to family court records.  Family court 
dockets, court orders and opinions are the only items that may be 
accessible via remote access.  If someone comes to the filing office or 
Domestic Relations Office, are they prohibited from reviewing other 
original documents in the file, such as the pleadings and mailing 
notices?   

Answer: Family court records are available at the courthouse facilities 
under Section 9.0.  With regard to a Domestic Relations Office, no public 
access to child support records except for PACSES dockets, court orders 
and opinions as provided by legal authority.  For more information, 
please review the Limits on Public Access to Unified Judicial System 
Case Records.

The following questions and answers are provided for general information only and may not be 
completely accurate in every circumstance.  This information is not legal advice and is not intended to

court or filing office about protocols for filing documents in your case.   

               

   

1.Section 11(A) provides that a party who wishes to request the correction of 
a clerical error “may submit a written request for correction.”  The use of 
the term “may” could suggest that it is the option of the filing party 
whether or not to make a written request – thus leaving open the 
possibility of oral requests (perhaps for simple matters such as spelling 
errors, etc.)  However, the subparagraphs of Section 11 that follow – 
specifically 11(B) and (C) which require submission of information on a 
form and service upon other parties (respectively) -- would suggest that 
all such requests must be in written form.   

nswer: The Commentary following Section 11.0 provides in part that 
“[a] party or party’s attorney is not required to utilize the procedures set 
forth in this section before making a formal motion for correction of a 
case record in the first instance.”  Thus, the protocols in Section 11.0 
should not be viewed as the exclusive means for correcting clerical 
errors.

2.Do documents prepared and filed by the court that include confidential 

information need to comply with the public access policy?  

 

Answer: The policy governs documents filed with the court by parties 
and attorneys.  It does not govern court-generated documents. 

3.Whether certification, as specified in Sections 7.0 and 8.0, is needed on 
every document filed with the court (e.g., entry of appearance, praecipe 
to transmit the record, etc.) or only those documents which have 
confidential information? 

Answer: Yes. The certification is required on every document filed with a 
court or custodian regardless of whether the filing contains “confidential 
information” requiring safeguarding under the Policy.  It serves the 
purposes of ensuring that the filing party has considered the Policy for 
every document before filing the same with the court.

5.Does the Policy require that a first and final accounting be filed in 

compliance with Sections 7.0 and 8.0? 

Answer: These documents are filed in guardianship matters and also in 
other matters, such as trusts and decedent’s estates.  With respect to 
guardianship matters only, these documents 
 are not publicly accessible.  Therefore, the filer would not need to follow 
the requirements of Sections 7.0 and 8.0 with respect to accounts filed in 
guardianship matters.

6.What about Petitions to Settle Small Estates that consist of social security 

numbers and other confidential information?  

Answer:  A filer must comply with the requirements in Sections 7.0 and 
8.0 to safeguard confidential information and documents.  

7.Are Guardians Ad Litem, masters, mediators, conciliators, etc. required to 
comply with the Policy?  Including filing certificates of compliance with 
everything?   

Answer: With regard to masters, mediators, and conciliators, documents 
generated by these quasi-judicial officials when performing their duties 
should be considered court-generated documents for purposes of this 
Policy.  However, they should omit confidential information not necessary 
to their evaluation/recommendation when drafting documents which are 
accessible to the public.  

With regard to Guardians Ad Litem (GAL), a GAL should be considered a 
party, and not counsel, a member of the public, or court personnel.  In 
Orphans' Court, a fiduciary (guardian, trustee, GAL, Trustee ad litem, 
executor, agent, etc.) is a party.  In other matters, a GAL may not be a 
party in the narrowest sense of a “plaintiff” or “defendant," and perhaps a 
GAL is analogous to amicus curiae.  It is recommended that they are 
treated as a "party" that is subject to the Policy.  

8.Should only initials be used when advertising a child's name change 

pursuant to statute? 

Answer: The statute requires notice of a proposed name change to be 
published, 54 Pa.C.S. § 701(a.1)(3)(ii)(A), while providing that “[i]f the 
court finds that the notice . . . would jeopardize the safety of the person 
seeking the name change or his or her child or ward, the notice required 
shall be waived by order of the court.” 54 Pa.C.S. § 701(a.1)(3)(iii). Proof 
of publication is required (unless waived).  See Section 701(a.1)(4)(ii)(A). 
Because publication would seem to be meaningless if only initials are 
used and there is an exception which requires court approval under 
certain circumstances, the use of the minor’s name is otherwise required 
by law.

9.Does the court have to comply with the Policy when filing custody orders?   

Answer: Court-generated documents, such as orders and opinions, are 
not governed by the Policy.  However, if it is possible to draft an order 
without using sensitive information, it is recommended that the court do 
so.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
