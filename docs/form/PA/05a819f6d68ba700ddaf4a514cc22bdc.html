LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN 

ection I.  Introduction and Purpose 

qual access to the courts is fundamental to the legitimacy of our system of justice and the trust and 
confidence of Pennsylvanians in our courts. Language services for individuals who are limited English 
proficient (LEP) or are deaf or hard of hearing are essential to ensure that they are able to fully 
participate in judicial proceedings and court services, programs, and activities in which their rights and 
interests are at stake. Without these services, they are effectively denied the protection of our laws. 
Moreover, the courts themselves have an independent interest in ensuring the integrity of 
communications with LEP and deaf or hard of hearing court users so that the fact finder can hear 
evidence accurately and deliver justice fairly. 

he policy of the Unified Judicial System is to provide meaningful language access for all individuals 

who are LEP to ensure that all persons have due process and equal access to all judicial proceedings, 
court services, programs and activities. Ensuring meaningful language access means providing timely, 
accurate, and effective language services at no cost to the court user. 

n addition, it is the policy of the Unified Judicial System to provide equally effective communication to 
individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, in part, by providing American Sign Language interpreters 
at no cost to litigants, witnesses and court spectators.1 

ennsylvania’s policies regarding language access to the courts are embodied in the Language Access 
Plan for the Unified Judicial System (LAP-UJS).  This plan was approved by the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court in March 2017. The LAP-UJS policies and requirements, which are binding on the judicial 
districts, are incorporated herein by reference. The LAP-UJS is available at languageaccess.pacourts.us.

The judicial district has appointed a language access coordinator who can be reached at 
fbell@clearfieldco.org  

ection II. Legal Basis 

he legal basis for this Language Access Plan is set forth in the LAP-UJS,2 Title VI of the Federal Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities 
Act at the Federal level, and the Pennsylvania Interpreter Act and regulations pursuant thereto at the 
State level.   

ection III. General Principles of Language Access 

eneral principles of language access are referenced in the LAP-UJS.3  Significant principles include 

the following:  
 

•  Courts are responsible for early identification of the need for language services, including, 
among other things, providing timely and effective notice to those in need of such services. 

• 

Interpretation and translation must be provided by the court at no cost. 

•  Persons who request language access services should be provided with them, in accordance 

with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and the Pennsylvania Interpreter Act. 

•  Language access services should be offered, even if not requested, where the need is apparent 

or where the ability of a person to understand and communicate in English is unclear. 

• 

Individuals who are LEP, deaf, or hard of hearing should never be expected to use informal 
interpreters, such as family members, opposing parties, or their counsel, nor should courts 
allow them to be used. 

•  Having an in-person interpreter for judicial proceedings is the most effective method to 

ensure effective communication for LEP court participants and is strongly preferred under 
the law. Remote interpretation through audio-visual technology, use of Video Remote 
Interpreting (“VRI”) or telephone is permitted only in limited circumstances, as set out in the 
Pennsylvania Interpreter Act regulations. 

•  Courts must provide interpreters in a timely manner.

•  Courts must provide meaningful language access to court users who are LEP, deaf, or hard of 
hearing in all services, programs, and activities of the courts. This means access must be 
provided in judicial proceedings (both criminal and civil), and for the general business of the 
courts.  

ection IV. Language Needs of this Judicial District 

ased on Language Access Data Collection information for 2018, below are the top 5 languages 
(including American Sign Language) for which interpreters were most frequently requested in this 
judicial district:  

1.  No Language Requests in 2018

☒ This judicial district provides interpreters for judicial proceedings in compliance with 
the rules and policies set forth in the Pennsylvania Interpreter Act and regulations, the 
AOPC Interpreter Certification Program regulations,4 and the Guidelines for the 
Procurement and Appointment of Interpreters issued by the AOPC.5 These policies 
require the District to provide court interpreters to all LEP and deaf or hard of hearing 
parties, victims, witnesses, and certain other persons6 for any civil or criminal 
proceeding.

are hereby incorporated by reference. 
6 The District must provide an interpreter to deaf and hard of hearing court users whether parties to a case, witnesses, family 
members, or spectators. Interpreters are also provided to limited English proficient fiduciaries for a party; and a parent, 
guardian, or custodian of a minor or incapacitated person who is a party, victim, or witness.

This Plan hereby incorporates by reference the Bilingual Employee Policy issued 
by AOPC on September 28, 2018, and reissued as amended on December 20, 2018. The 
policy became effective on January 1, 2019.  

nder the policy, current employees of the UJS who are bilingual and intend to 

continue to use their bilingual skills to assist limited English proficient and deaf and hard 
of hearing members of the public must be tested and achieve a passing score, as defined 
by the policy, by January 1, 2021. Employees hired after January 1, 2019, who intend to 
use their language skills to assist LEP and deaf and hard of hearing members of the 
public must be tested and achieve a passing score as defined by the policy before they can 
utilize their skills to assist members of the public.  

his judicial district has taken the following steps to implement the Bilingual 

Employee Policy: 

 (a) We have incorporated testing of bilingual employees into our hiring 

process for new employees who will use their bilingual skills to assist 
members of the public as a part of their jobs. 

 (b) We have informed employees hired before January 1, 2019, who use their 
bilingual skills to assist members of the public that they will need to be 
tested by their judicial districts and achieve a passing score as defined by 
the policy by January 1, 2021, or no longer use their bilingual skills as a 
part of their job. 

 (c) Bilingual employees and their supervisors have viewed the AOPC-

produced training, available at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJP7e_znOU. 

 We have not taken the above-listed actions, but intend to complete each step 
by the following dates.  

a)  Testing of bilingual employees will be incorporated into our hiring process by 

[December 3rd, 2019]. 

 

(b) Bilingual employees will be informed that they will need to be tested by the 
judicial district and achieve a passing score as defined by the policy, or no 
longer use their bilingual skills as a part of their job by [January 5th, 2020]. 

(c)  The above-referenced AOPC-produced training video will be viewed by 

bilingual employees and their supervisors by [insert date]. 

 We do not have any bilingual employees. Therefore, we will utilize in-person 
interpreters where available and will utilize telephone interpreting in

☒  We have reviewed  our court website with an eye to translating webpages  in subject 

matter areas in which our judicial district experiences high LEP usage. 

☐ We have translated the following pages using qualified translators:  

☐ We intend to translate the following pages by (date) using qualified translators:  

☒  The judicial district has contracted with Language Line to provide telephone 

interpreting services, primarily for counter communication with LEP court users.11 

  Instructions for contacting a telephone interpreter have been posted and distributed to 
all staff who interact with the public. 

Language access requirements apply not only to judicial proceedings, but also to a wide 
range of services, programs, and activities outside the courtroom that are administered under 
the authority of the court, i.e., provided by or contracted for by the court.12  

eaningful access to services outside the courtroom is a vital component of equal justice for 

LEP and deaf or hard of hearing persons. Examples of court services outside the courtroom 
include the following if administered under the authority of the court: services of the 
domestic relations office, the juvenile and adult probation offices, pro se clinics, some 
Alternative Dispute Resolution programs (ADR), family court custody education and 
mediation programs, drug and alcohol evaluation and treatment, mental health evaluation and 
treatment, anger management classes, domestic violence programs, safe driving classes, and 
other diversionary and educational programs.

11 See, Section IX, Training, below. Judicial district employees have been trained in the appropriate use of telephone 
interpreting, and know that its best use is for brief encounters at the counter, rather than judicial proceedings, per Section 104 
of the regulations pursuant to the Interpreter Act.

In many judicial districts certain court programs and services are provided by private, third party 

vendors under contract with or paid by the court. Judicial districts are responsible to ensure that 
meaningful access is provided to LEP persons by vendors of these services and should review and seek 
adjustment of contract terms accordingly.   
 

☐ In addition, the judicial district is working with the vendors with whom it contracts to 
provide programs to ensure that those vendors comply with Title VI, the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.13 Specifically, the district 
includes the following provisions in its contracts with vendors and has encouraged the 
county to do so, as well, in its contracts with vendors that provide court programs and 
services: 

 The judicial district has not yet worked to include language in vendor contracts 

requiring compliance with Title VI, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The district intends to accomplish this by this date: 
December of 2020.  

☒ In addition, the Language Access Coordinator and/or DCA for the judicial district have 
advised judges that they should consider the ability of an LEP litigant to complete a 
given program before ordering him or her to do so, and have advised judges that they 
should not put an LEP litigant in danger of being held in contempt, charged extra fees 
or costs, or subject to any other adverse consequence for failure to complete a program 
that did not provide competent interpretation and translation. 

ection VI. Early Identification of the Need for Language Services 

                                            
13 For example, language similar to the following could be used: 

Vendor  will  comply,  and  all  its  subcontractors  will  comply,  with  the  nondiscrimination  requirements  of  the  Civil 
Rights Act of 1870; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Subtitle 
A, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1990); Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; 
Regulations  implementing  Sections  799A  and  845  of  the  Public  Health  Service  Act,  45  C.F.R.  Part  83;  the  Age 
Discrimination  Act  of  1975;  and  45  C.F.R.  Parts  83,  84,  86,  and  90,  as  well  as  any  other  applicable  federal 
nondiscrimination  statutes  and  regulations.  Specifically,  Vendor  must  provide  foreign  language  interpreters  and 
translated documents to limited English proficient participants in compliance with Title VI of the federal Civil Rights 
Act, and sign language interpreters to deaf or hard of hearing participants in compliance with the Americans  with 
Disabilities Act.
