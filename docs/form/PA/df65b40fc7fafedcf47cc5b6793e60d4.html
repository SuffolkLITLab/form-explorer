documents shall be deemed to governed by this Order, and shall be valid and

enforceable as though they referred to this Order, to the extent that they are in 

compliance herewith.  All references to counsel or attorneys herein shall, as 

appropriate, apply to litigants appearing pro se as well.  The Court reserves the 

right, for any particular matter or instance, to waive, suspend, or modify any 

aspect of this Order or any other administrative order issued pursuant the Judicial 

Emergency if the interests of justice so require. 

I.  PUBLIC ACCESS TO COURT FACILITIES 

A.  Huntingdon County Courthouse 

1.  Physical access to the first floor offices generally (Prothonotary, Clerk of 

Courts, Clerk of the Orphans’ Court, Register and Recorder of Deeds, and 

Office of Court Appointed Counsel) shall be as established from time to time 

by the Huntingdon County Commissioners and the individuals having 

ultimate supervisory control over such offices.   

a.  To the extent that local rules, the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal 

Procedure, or past custom and practice would dictate that the Director 

of the Office of Court Appointed Counsel or attorneys under his 

supervision meet with defendants in person, the Director and his 

supervisees shall have the right to conduct such meetings by means of 

Advanced Communication Technology (“ACT”)1 to the greatest extent 

possible within constitutional requirements for effective assistance of 

counsel. 

2.  The electronic filing procedures put in place by AO-4-2020 will continue for 

the duration of the Judicial Emergency, as modified in Section II.A below. 

3.  Physical access to the second floor offices and facilities—courtrooms, 

judges’ chambers, and the offices of court staff—will resume on July 1, 

                                                           
1 As defined by Pa.R.Crim.P. 103, “Advanced Communication Technology is any communication equipment 
that is used as a link between parties in physically separate locations, and includes, but is not limited to: 
systems providing for two-way simultaneous communication of image and sound; closed-circuit television; 
telephone and facsimile equipment; and electronic mail.” (emphasis in original).  As used within the 20th 
Judicial District, ACT typically means direct telephone calls, telephone conference calls, and live video 
conferences conducted using a combination of the Zoom video communications platform and, for defendants 
in custody, the Polycom video communications platform connected to the various correctional facilities within 
the Commonwealth. 

3 

 

2020.  The Court will resume scheduling proceedings in person, rather than 

remotely by ACT, as of that date.  

a.  All individuals coming to the second floor offices and facilities, both 

those participating in proceedings and those present to observe 

proceedings, will be required to have a mask and to observe social 

distancing guidelines. 

b.  The precise infection control procedures for proceedings will be 

determined on an ongoing basis, depending on the nature of the 

proceeding, the number of participants, and then-current infection 

control guidance.  They may include, without limitation, social 

distancing, spot cleaning between proceedings, modified scheduling, the 

wearing of masks, the use of alternate locations, and the reconfiguring of 

courtroom seating arrangements.  Court staff will provide timely 

guidance and direction for participants as changes are made.   

4.  Certain proceedings will be conducted via ACT, as set forth herein.  Public 

access to such proceedings will continue to be via livestream of non-

confidential matters on the Court’s YouTube channel.  Notice of that 

livestream will continue to be provided on the Court’s web page using the 

following language, which sets forth the details of such access. 

Public  hearings  conducted  by  video  may  be  viewed 

live  at 

www.youtube.com/channel/UCLAYbwpQ-bPC8fYYATOR2lQ/featured.  

Public access to the courts is an important Constitutional right, and in an 

effort to enable the continued exercise of that right during the COVID-19 

judicial emergency, we have developed this site.  Please note that the right 

of access is not absolute; certain proceedings are confidential, in whole or 

in part, due to the nature of the parties or information involved (e.g., most 

cases  involving  minors  or  the  disclosure  of  sensitive  personal  financial 

information).    Proceedings  may  be  designated  confidential  generally  by 

rule, or specifically by the Court.  Confidential proceedings are closed to the 

public, and will not be available for viewing on this site. 

4 

 

Non-confidential  proceedings  will  be  livestreamed  here  as  they  occur.  

Please note that they will not be available for replay, as they are not video 

recorded.  All proceedings are being recorded by the Court Reporter, and 

transcripts may be requested as with any other proceeding.  Just as with 

any physical courtroom in Pennsylvania, it is a crime to use any device to 

record  (audio  or  video)  or  take  photographs  of  the  proceedings 

broadcast  on  this  site,  per  18  Pa.  C.S.  §  5103.1.    Violations  are 

punishable by a sentence of up to two years in prison and a fine of up 

to  $5,000  for  the  first  offense.    All  reports  of  recording  will  be 

investigated and, if proven, prosecuted. 

B.  Magisterial District Courts – Beginning July 1, 2020, the lobby of each 

Magisterial District Court (each, an “MDC”) will reopen for public access, 

primarily to allow filings and payments to be made.  Due to facilities 

limitations, the courtroom in each MDC will remain closed, and the MDCs will 

continue to conduct proceedings via ACT, absent exceptional circumstances for 

particular matters.  Magisterial District Judges shall confirm with the President 

Judge before scheduling a proceeding in person.   

C.  Subunits – Access to the Office of Domestic Relations and the Probation Office is 

addressed in Section VII below. 

II. ELECTRONIC FILING OF DOCUMENTS (PREVIOUSLY AO-4-2020) 

A.  Court of Common Pleas and Orphans’ Court 

1.  All filings with the Prothonotary (civil matters), Clerk of Courts (criminal 

matters), and Clerk of the Orphans’ Court (estates, trusts, guardianships, 

and adoptions) that would ordinarily be required to be made either in 

person or via U.S. Mail may be made via e-mail at the following addresses, 

respectively: 

a.  prothonotary-orders@huntingdoncounty.net 

b.  clerkofcourts@huntingdoncounty.net 

c.  orphans-court@huntingdoncounty.net 

5 

 

2.  Each document filed shall be transmitted as a .pdf attachment.  Scanned 

signatures will be accepted as originals.  Each filing e-mail shall be copied 

to: (i) all persons to whom service copies would ordinarily be sent via U.S. 

Mail; (ii) Court Administration at ctadmin.orders@huntingdoncounty.net; 

and (iii) in the case of filings pertaining to appeals, to the Director of 

Judicial Operations and Law Clerk at ssnare@huntingdoncounty.net and 

mrohrbaugh@huntingdoncounty.net, respectively. 

3.  The Prothonotary, Clerk of Courts, and Clerk of the Orphans’ Court are 

hereby directed to monitor the inboxes for the above e-mail addresses 

regularly for the receipt of electronically filed documents.  Upon receipt, the 

transmittal e-mail and all attached documents shall be printed and then 

filed as if received in hard copy, except that the notation “Filed under AO-

23-2020” shall be added next to the time stamp. 

4.  The requirement for the immediate payment of filing fees will be suspended 

for all filings completed by e-mail under this Order.  The existing 

arrangements made for billing and payment of fees by the Prothonotary, 

Clerk of Courts, and Clerk of the Orphans’ Court while operating under AO-

4-2020 shall remain in effect, as same may be modified by such parties from 

time to time.  

B.  Magisterial District Courts – Filings for civil matters will remain in person or via 

U.S. mail.  However, if an individual needs to make a particular filing via e-mail, 

in a manner similar to that available for the Court of Common Pleas and 

Orphans’ Court (set forth in Section II.A above), that individual may contact the 

relevant Magisterial District Court and request permission to do so, and the 

Magisterial District Courts are authorized to accept filings in such manner and 

to bill such individuals for any filing fees. 

III. COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OPERATIONS 

A.  Criminal Proceedings Other Than Jury Trials 

1.  Court Administration will resume scheduling all criminal proceedings to 

occur in-person as of July 1, 2020.   

6 

 

2.  Notwithstanding Pa.R.Crim.P. 119, defendants who are in custody are 

required to participate in all proceedings via ACT.  The other 

participants will be present in the courtroom.  It has been, and will continue 

to be, the policy of the Court not to transport defendants who are in custody 

between correctional facilities or between correctional facilities and any 

court facility during the Judicial Emergency, unless absolutely necessary.  

3.  Defendants who are not in custody will be required to appear in person.  

Failure to appear will result in the issuance of a bench warrant.     

4.  Counsel for either the Commonwealth or the defendant may request that a 

particular proceeding be conducted via ACT, or that one of the participants 

(i.e., counsel themselves or a witness or the defendant) be permitted to 

participate via ACT.  Requests shall be made by e-mail to Court 

Administration (at ctadmin.orders@huntingdoncounty.net) not less than 

two weeks prior to the scheduled matter, absent extenuating 

circumstances.  Proceedings changed to ACT may be rescheduled for a later 

date, at the Court’s discretion.   

5.  Formal arraignment and the initial pretrial conference will no longer be 

scheduled simultaneously.  Instead, the initial pretrial conference will be 

scheduled for a date that is between six and eight weeks after: (i) the 

preliminary hearing, if the defendant has waived formal arraignment; or 

(ii) formal arraignment.  Any motion for a pretrial conference filed after the 

initial pretrial conference shall include a trial memorandum or pretrial 

statement that addresses the following matters: 

a.  Status of pretrial discovery;  

b.  Stipulation and admissibility of evidence; 

c.  Witnesses (including expert witnesses);  

d.  Proposed deadlines for pretrial motions (including defenses, 

suppression, and discovery); and 

7 

 

e.  Status of plea negotiations, if any.2 

6.  General criminal court terms are suspended during the Judicial Emergency.  

Court Administration will instead schedule cases in blocks, so as to avoid 

having a large number of defendants present in the courtroom at one time, 

waiting for their case to be called.  The exact timing and number of cases to 

be included in each block will be determined by Court Administration, and 

may be changed from time to time.   

B.  Criminal Jury Trials 

1.  Jury selection is scheduled to resume on August 3, 2020, at the Halbritter 

Center for the Performing Arts at Juniata College (so as to allow for 

appropriate social distancing).  The location and manner of jury selection 

thereafter will be determined at a later date. 

2.  Jury trials are scheduled to resume in August 2020, and will take place in-

person in Courtroom 1, subject to infection control measures based on 

3.  Defendants who are in custody will be transported for jury selection and 

then-current guidance.   

jury trials. 

4.  Scheduling priority for jury trials, including jury selection, will be given to 

criminal cases over civil cases. 

C.  Civil Division and Orphans’ Court Proceedings 

1.  Court Administration will resume scheduling all Civil Division and Orphans’  

Court proceedings to occur in-person as of July 1, 2020. 

2.  General civil court terms, including, without limitation, custody terms and 

Children & Youth Services terms, are suspended during the Judicial 

Emergency.  Court Administration will instead schedule cases in blocks, so 

as to avoid having a large number of participants present in the courtroom 

at one time, waiting for their case to be called.  The exact timing and 

                                                           
2 The Court will not engage in plea negotiations between the Commonwealth and the defendant.  The inclusion 
of this information is purely for the purpose of placing it on the record for the benefit of the parties, in case the 
status or details of any potential plea deal become a matter of contention at a later date. 

8 

 

number of cases to be included in each block will be determined by Court 

Administration, and may be changed from time to time. 

3.  Counsel for a party may request that a particular proceeding be conducted 

via ACT, or that one of the participants (i.e., counsel themselves or a party 

or witness) be permitted to participate via ACT.  Requests shall be made in 

writing by e-mail to Court Administration (at 

ctadmin.orders@huntingdoncounty.net) not less than two weeks prior to 

the scheduled matter, absent extenuating circumstances.  Proceedings 

changed to ACT may be rescheduled for a later date, at the Court’s 

discretion. 

A.  Generally 

IV. MAGISTERIAL DISTRICT COURT OPERATIONS 
(FORMERLY AO-18-2020) 

1.  The MDCs have resumed normal operations to the fullest extent attainable 

via ACT.  The primary form of ACT remains Zoom, with telephone 

conference call as a backup.  However, each MDC shall have the option to 

schedule payment determination hearings by telephone in lieu of Zoom. 

2.  Central Court will remain suspended for the duration of the Judicial 

Emergency.  Each MDC will schedule hearings for new criminal matters 

charged in their jurisdiction, subject to direction from this Court as may be 

issued from time to time.   

B.  Use of ACT 

1.  All parties in all matters before the MDCs are required to appear via ACT, 

absent prior approval by this Court.  The protocols for criminal and civil 

matters attached at Exhibit A shall govern the conduct of such hearings 

before the MDCs, and shall be directly applicable to attorneys appearing in 

such matters.  However, defendants (and plaintiffs, for civil matters) 

appearing before the MDCs will not be held to have knowledge of such 

protocols before their appearance; rather, the Magistrate District Judge 

should inform them of the protocols as needed during the proceeding.  

9 

 

Defendants (and plaintiffs, for civil matters) shall be held to the 

protocols set forth the Notice attached at Exhibit B, which shall be 

enclosed with every notice for every hearing or other proceeding 

scheduled by a MDC via ACT during the Judicial Emergency.  Note that 

in addition to basic ACT hearing protocols, the attached notice provides 

instructions for downloading and using the Zoom app to appear before the 

MDC. 

2.  Where a defendant (or other party) appearing remotely would ordinarily 

sign a form in person and submit it to the MDC as part of the record (for 

example, a Waiver of Preliminary Hearing), the Magisterial District Judge 

shall: (i) colloquy the defendant as per standard practice; (ii) confirm with 

the defendant that he or she wishes to take the action in question and sign 

the form; (iii) sign the form on behalf of the defendant while the defendant 

is before the MDC; (iv) notify the defendant that the Magisterial District 

Judge has signed the form on their behalf; and then (v) complete and sign 

the Remote Signature Certification form attached at Exhibit C (note that the 

attached will continue to refer to AO-18-2020 for the sake of simplicity, but 

its use will now be governed by this Order).     

3.  All exhibits to be considered by the MDC must be transmitted via e-mail to 

Court Administration (ctadmin.orders@huntingdoncounty.net), with copy 

to opposing counsel (or the opposing party, if a pro se litigant) no later than 

noon on the business day immediately preceding the date of the 

proceeding.  Acceptable formats are .pdf, .jpg, .png, and .mp4, with all 

Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) to be 

converted to .pdf unless specific formatting or metadata is a relevant part of 

the exhibit.  No other file types or transmittal methods will be accepted 

without prior approval.  Filenames should include the short-form docket 

number and a brief, objective description of the item (e.g., “xxx-2020 Police 

Report”).  Court Administration will distribute the exhibits to each MDC, as 

appropriate.   

10 

 

V. PROTECTION FROM ABUSE ORDERS (FORMERLY AO-05-2020) 

A.  Procedure During Normal Business Hours 

1.  Effective July 1, 2020, the requirement that all individuals contacting the 

Court of Common Pleas or the Prothonotary seeking a Protection From 

Abuse Order be directed to contact either Huntingdon House or The Abuse 

Network for assistance with completing and filing a Petition for Temporary 

PFA is rescinded.  Such individuals should be encouraged to contact those 

agencies for assistance, but they may also complete and file a Petition for 

Temporary PFA per standard practice, and the Court will conduct the initial 

ex parte hearing in-person.   

2.  Petitions for Emergency PFAs filed by or with the assistance of Huntingdon 

House, The Abuse Network, or a private attorney may be filed via e-mail to 

the Prothonotary as a .pdf attachment at 

prothonotary.orders@huntingdoncounty.net, with copy to Court 

Administration at ctadmin.orders@huntingdoncounty.net, or via facsimile 

sent to the Prothonotary and Court Administration.  In either case, Court 

Administration will provide the Petition to the Judge for review.  The ex 

parte hearing for all Petitions filed in this manner will be conducted via ACT 

(likely telephone, but possibly via Zoom, if appropriate).  The Court will 

initiate the call or provide the meeting instructions by e-mail.  Therefore, 

once the Petition has been transmitted, the petitioner shall remain at 

Huntingdon House, The Abuse Network, or the office of their attorney 

pending the hearing, and the transmittal e-mail or facsimile cover sheet for 

the Petition shall include a phone number where the petitioner (and their 

counsel, if represented) can be reached directly, as well as an e-mail 

address, if available.   

3.  Upon receipt of a Petition filed via e-mail, the Prothonotary shall print the 

transmittal e-mail and all attached documents and file them as if received in 

hard copy.  Petitions filed via facsimile shall include the cover sheet.  In each 

case, the Prothonotary shall add the notation “Filed under AO-23-2020” 

next to the time stamp. 

11 

 

4.  For situations where an individual’s freedom of movement is restricted, 

either physically or medically, such that they cannot meet in person with 

Huntingdon House, The Abuse Network, or the Prothonotary (such as 

where a person is hospitalized, or is unable to leave their home due to a 

quarantine, physical handicap, or lack of available transportation), the 

Court will determine an appropriate accommodation to enable the filing 

and taking of testimony. 

B.  Procedure Outside of Normal Business Hours – The procedure for seeking PFAs 

after normal business hours shall remain largely unchanged, with petitioners 

contacting 911 and then being directed to the on-call Magisterial District Judge 

for an Emergency PFA.  However, rather than directing the petitioner to appear 

at the Court of Common Pleas within twenty-four hours to seek a Temporary 

PFA, the Magisterial District Judge should encourage the petitioner to contact 

Huntingdon House or The Abuse Network first, and then the Prothonotary if 

neither agency is available, within the twenty-four hour timeframe (per the 

process in Section V.A above). 

C.  Subsequent Hearings – All hearings regarding Petitions for PFAs after the initial 

ex parte hearing will occur in person, with scheduling of such hearings to being 

July 1, 2020.  Either party may petition the Court to conduct the hearing via 

ACT, in whole or in part, as set forth in Section III.C.3 above 

VI. USE OF, AND PROTOCOLS FOR, ACT (PREVIOUSLY AO-16-2020) 

A.  Format – The primary form of ACT for proceedings will continue to be the 

Zoom video communications platform, with telephone conference call as a 

backup, subject to the Court’s discretion.  This does not affect telephone 

conference calls for hearings on temporary protection from abuse orders, 

addressed in Section V above. 

B.  Participation 

1.  Where a proceeding has been scheduled by the Court to occur via ACT, the 

parties and other participants are required to appear in that manner.  

12 

 

2.  Separate protocols have been established for criminal, civil, and family law 

matters, and are attached hereto for reference at Exhibit A.  The conduct of 

counsel, litigants, witnesses, and other participants in proceedings 

conducted in whole or in part by via ACT shall be governed by such 

protocols.  Court Administration will continue to attach the relevant 

protocols to notices sent out for proceedings to be conducted via ACT.  

Counsel who are calling witnesses are charged with providing a copy of the 

relevant protocols to their witnesses prior to the proceeding.   

3.  For all proceedings to be conducted by ACT, all exhibits to be considered by 

the Court must be transmitted via e-mail to Court Administration 

(ctadmin.orders@huntingdoncounty.net) and the Director of Judicial 

Operations  (ssnare@huntingdoncounty.net), with copy to opposing 

counsel (or the opposing party, if a pro se litigant) no later than noon on the 

business day immediately preceding the date of the proceeding.  Acceptable 

formats are .pdf, .jpg, .png, and .mp4, with all Microsoft Office documents 

(Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) to be converted to .pdf unless 

specific formatting or metadata is a relevant part of the exhibit.  No other 

file types or transmittal methods will be accepted without prior approval.  

Filenames should include the short-form docket number and a brief, 

objective description of the item (e.g., “xxx-2020 Texts From Defendant”).

EXHIBIT A 

Please see attached. 

PROTOCOLS FOR CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CONDUCTED VIA  
ADVANCED COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY 

 

Pursuant to Administrative Order AO-16-2020 and the Notice to Appear to which these Protocols are attached, you 

have been directed to appear before the Huntingdon County Court of Common Pleas via advanced communication technology 

at the date and time specified in the Notice.  Appearance before the Court via advanced communication technology is the same 

as appearance before the Court in person, and the expectations and requirements in regard to your conduct are unchanged. 

These Protocols are broken down into Sections directed to defendants who are not in custody (Section I), defendants 

who  are  in  custody  (Section  II),  attorneys  (Section  III),  and  witnesses  (Section  IV),  along  with  specific  instructions  for 

downloading and installing the Zoom app (Section V).  Please review the appropriate sections below carefully. 

In addition to the below, note that for defendants who are not in custody, you must follow these instructions 

and appear as directed in the Notice.  Failure to appear may result in the issuance of a bench warrant for your arrest. 

   

I.  DEFENDANTS NOT IN CUSTODY 

A.  You have been directed to appear before the Court 
via  Zoom  meeting.    The  meeting  will  serve  as  the 
virtual  courtroom. 
for  how  to 
download  the  Zoom  app  are  in  Section  V,  below, 
including the range of devices able to use it.   

Instructions 

 

B.  Unless you are appearing from the same location as 
your attorney, you must appear alone.  Adult family 
members  who  would  ordinarily  be  allowed  to  be 
present  in  the  courtroom  (i.e.,  those  who  are  not 
witnesses) may be in the room with you, but cannot 
participate unless called on, and must remain quiet 
and not interrupt.  Children should not be present. 

C.  These  Protocols  are  set  up 

for  defendants 
participating  from  a  location  separate  from  their 
attorney.    If  you  are  in  the  same  location  as  your 
attorney,  some  of 
these  Protocols  will  be 
inapplicable.  Apply common sense as appropriate. 

D.  The  Meeting  ID  and  password  are  included  in  the 
Notice.    Join  the  meeting  at  least  5  minutes  before 
the scheduled time.  Unless prior approval has been 
granted by the Court, you must appear by video, as 
opposed to voice only. 

E.  When  you join  the meeting you will be in a virtual 
waiting  room  with  all  other  parties,  attorneys  and 
witnesses.    There  may  be  several  cases  set  on  the 
docket  at  that  time.    When  your  case  is  called,  the 
Court will bring you into the virtual courtroom.  

F.  When  you  enter  the  virtual  courtroom,  your  video 
will automatically be on and your audio muted, until 
the  hearing  begins.   You  will  need  to  unmute  your 
audio  by  clicking  the  microphone  icon.    When  you 
are  called  upon  to  speak,  start  talking,  pause  for  a 
moment, and then continue, so give the audio time 
to “catch up.”  Be careful and courteous when others 
are  speaking;  if  you  cough,  rustle  papers,  or 
otherwise make noise, you may cut them off. 

G.  Proceedings  will  be  on  the  record.    The  Court’s 
standing  rules  prohibiting  video  and  audio 
recording  in  the  courtroom,  along  with  the  ban  on 
the use of cellphones generally, remain in effect.  You 

are  prohibited  from  recording  the  proceedings  in 
any way.  All proceedings are being recorded by the 
Court Reporter, and transcripts may be requested as 
with any other proceeding. 

H.  You  may  confer  with  or  provide  notes  to  your 
attorney using the private chat feature.  To do so, hit 
the  “CHAT”  button,  and  at  the  bottom  of  the  chat 
window,  pull-down  the  recipient  arrow  and  select 
your attorney’s name.   

Note: 

1.  You are prohibited from using the chat feature to 
communicate  with  witnesses, 
opposing 
attorneys, the judge, or court staff present in the 
meeting.  

2.  You are not to  communicate with your attorney 

or anyone else while you are testifying.   

3.  You are not to hold or refer to notes, paperwork, 
or other materials while testifying, the same as if 
you were you were on the witness stand in a live 
courtroom. 

If  needed,  you  may  confer  in  private  with  your 
attorney.  The Court will enable this by moving you 
and  your  attorney  into  a  separate,  confidential 
“breakout  room,”  while  keeping  the  primary 
meeting open.  The Court will not at any time enter 
the  breakout  room,  and  conversations  in  these 
rooms are not recorded in any way.  When you are 
ready to return to the virtual courtroom be sure to 
click  “return  to  main  session,”  as  opposed  to 
“leave meeting.”   

I. 

J.  The  Court  may  use  breakout  rooms  for  sidebar 
discussions with counsel.  The Court may shift you 
back  to  the  virtual  waiting  room  while  such 
discussions occur, and will bring you back into the 
virtual courtroom when ready.   

K.  Do  not 

leave 

the  meeting  under  any 
the  proceedings  are 
circumstances  until 
concluded.  This would be the same as walking out 
of  court  in  the  middle  of  a  hearing  without  being 
dismissed. 

II.  DEFENDANTS IN CUSTODY 

III. ATTORNEYS 

A.  On  your  end,  your  appearance  via  advanced 
communication  technology will be in the form of a 
video  call,  subject  to  the  direction  of  the  facility 
where you are being held. 

B.  On the Court’s side, you may only see the judge, or, 
at  times,  you  may  see  an  empty  conference  room.  
The  Court  Reporter,  attorneys  (including  your 
attorney), and other participants will be appearing 
via conference call.  The audio will come through the 
speakerphone  on  the  conference  room  table.    You 
will  be  able  to  hear  them,  and  they  will  be  able  to 
hear you. 

C.  If you need to  confer with your attorney  privately, 
the judge will leave the room, and the other parties 
will be excluded from the conference call.  You will 
then be able to talk with your attorney with you on 
video and your attorney on the speakerphone in the 
conference  room.    If  you  have not  had  a  chance  to 
confer with your attorney before the proceeding, the 
Court  will  make  time  available  to  you  for  this  to 
occur. 

A.  You  and  your  client  have  been  directed  to  appear 
before  the  Court  via  Zoom  meeting.    The  meeting 
will serve as the virtual courtroom.  Instructions for 
how  to  download  the  Zoom  app  are  in  Section  V, 
below, including the range of devices able to use it.  
All  attorneys  appearing  before  the  Court  via 
advanced communication technology are deemed to 
be familiar with, and shall follow, these Protocols.  If

B.  If  your  client  does  not  have  access  to  technology 
sufficient  that  they  can  use  Zoom,  or  is  not 
technologically  skilled  enough  to  use  Zoom,  they 
may appear with you from a suitable location (e.g., 
your  office).    Otherwise,  you  and  your  client  shall 
appear from separate locations.  These Protocols are 
for  proceedings  with  all  participants 
set  up 
appearing from separate locations.  If this is not the 
case,  some  of  these  Protocols  will  be  inapplicable.  
Apply common sense as appropriate. 

C.  The  Meeting  ID  and  password  are  included  in  the 
Notice.    Join  the  meeting  at  least  5  minutes  before 
the scheduled time.  Unless prior approval has been 
granted  by  the  Court,  you,  your  client,  and  any 
witnesses must appear by video, as opposed to voice 
only.   

D.  When  you join the meeting you will be in a virtual 
waiting  room  with  all  other  parties,  attorneys  and 
witnesses.    There  may  be  several  cases  set  on  the 
docket at that time.  When your client’s case is called, 
the  Court  will  bring  you  and  your  client  into  the 
virtual courtroom.

E.  When  you  enter  the  virtual  courtroom,  your  video 
will automatically be on and your audio muted.  You 
will  need  to  unmute  your  audio  by  clicking  the 
microphone icon.   

F.  When  you  go  to  speak,  start  talking,  pause  for  a 
moment, and then continue, so give the audio time 
to “catch up.”  Be careful and courteous when others 
are  speaking;  if  you  cough,  rustle  papers,  or 
otherwise make noise, you may cut them off.   

G.  Wait  until  questions  are  completed  before 
announcing  an  objection.    Do  not  interrupt  or  talk 
over witnesses or opposing counsel.  Because of the 
way the Zoom app gives primacy to the most recent 
speaker,  speaking  over  others  cuts  off  their  audio.  
The usual vigorous back-and-forth between counsel 
needs  to  be  slowed  down  so  all  can  be  heard, 
allowing the Court to make appropriate rulings. 

H.  You may confer with or provide notes to your client 
using  the  private  chat  feature.    To  do  so,  hit  the 
“CHAT”  button,  and  at  the  bottom  of  the  chat 
window,  pull-down  the  recipient  arrow  and  select 
your client’s name.  You may not chat, text, or in any 
way  confer  with  your  client  during  his  or  her 
testimony.    You  are  not  to  use  the  private  chat 
feature  with  any  non-client  witnesses  or  opposing 
counsel.   

I. 

If  you  need  to  have  a  private  conversation  with 
client, the Court will move you both into a separate, 
confidential  “breakout  room,”  while  keeping  the 
primary  meeting  open.    The  Court  will  not  at  any 
time enter the breakout room, and conversations in 
these rooms are not recorded in any way.  When you 
are ready to return to the virtual courtroom be sure 
to  click  “return  to  main  session,”  as  opposed  to 
“leave meeting.”   

J.  The Court may also use breakout rooms for sidebar 
discussions with counsel and for private discussions 
between you and opposing counsel.   

K.  Each party is responsible for having their witnesses 
in the virtual waiting room at least 5 minutes before 
the scheduled time.   

L.  If  witnesses  are  to  be  sequestered,  the  Court  will 
move  them  back  to  the  virtual  waiting  room,  and 
then recall them when it is time for them to testify.  
Sequestered  witnesses  are  not  permitted  to  watch 
the public livestream (if any) during the hearing, or 
otherwise  view  or  listen  to  the  proceedings  in 
breach of the sequestration.

further prohibited from communicating with you 
in  any  fashion  while  you  are  sequestered, 
whether  via  the  chat  feature,  telephone,  text,  e-
mail, or otherwise. 

2.  You  are not permitted  to  hold or  refer  to  notes, 
paperwork,  or  other  materials  while  testifying.  
All  testimony  must  be  from  memory,  unless 
otherwise directed by the Court. 

I.  The  Court  may  use  breakout  rooms  for  sidebar 
discussions with counsel.  The Court may shift you 
back  to  the  virtual  waiting  room  while  such 
discussions occur, and will bring you back into the 
virtual courtroom when ready.

depending on the device or devices you intend to use 
for  your  appearance.    (You  can  do  this  by  clicking 
Resources,  and  selecting  Install  Client  or  App).    If 
you  cannot  figure  out  how  to  do  it,  just  remember 
this—when  you  attempt  to  host  or  join  a  meeting, 
Zoom will ask you whether to open  the meeting in 
the browser or open/install the Zoom app.  Instruct 
it to open in the Zoom app and allow it to install the

“CHAT”  button,  and  at  the  bottom  of  the  chat 
window,  pull-down  the  recipient  arrow  and  select 
your client’s name.  You may not chat, text, or in any 
way  confer  with  your  client  during  his  or  her 
testimony.    You  are  not  to  use  the  private  chat 
feature  with  any  non-client  witnesses  or  opposing 
counsel.   

I. 

If  you  need  to  have  a  private  conversation  with 
client, the Court will move you both into a separate, 
confidential  “breakout  room,”  while  keeping  the 
primary  meeting  open.    The  Court  will  not  at  any 
time enter the breakout room, and conversations in 
these rooms are not recorded in any way.  When you 
are ready to return to the virtual courtroom be sure 
to  click  “return  to  main  session,”  as  opposed  to 
“leave meeting.”   

J.  The Court may also use breakout rooms for sidebar 
discussions  with  counsel,  for  private  discussions 
between you and opposing counsel, and to conduct 
virtual in-chambers interviews of minor children.   

K.  Each party is responsible for having their witnesses 
in the virtual waiting room at least 5 minutes before 
the scheduled time.   

L.  If  witnesses  are  to  be  sequestered,  the  Court  will 
move  them  back  to  the  virtual  waiting  room,  and 
then recall them when it is time for them to testify.  
Sequestered  witnesses  are  not  permitted  to  watch 
the public livestream (if any) during the hearing, or 
otherwise  view  or  listen  to  the  proceedings  in

III. ADULT WITNESSES 

A.  You have been called to appear before the Court as a 
witness via Zoom meeting.  The meeting will serve 
as  the  virtual  courtroom.    Instructions  for  how  to 
download  the  Zoom  app  are  in  Section  IV,  below, 
including the range of devices able to use it.   

B.  You must be alone in the room from which you are 
appearing.  Friends or family members who wish to 
view  the  proceedings  must  do  so  from  the  public 
livestream, if available. 

C.  The  Meeting  ID  and  password  are  included  in  the 
Notice.    Join  the  meeting  at  least  5  minutes  before 
the scheduled time.  Unless prior approval has been 
granted by the Court, you must appear by video, as 
opposed to voice only. 

D.  When  you join the meeting you will be in a virtual 
waiting  room  with  all  other  parties,  attorneys  and 
witnesses.    There  may  be  several  cases  set  on  the 
docket at that time.  When the case you are testifying 
in is called, the Court will bring you into the virtual 
courtroom.  

E.  When  you  enter  the  virtual  courtroom,  your  video 
will automatically be on and your audio muted, until 
the  proceedings  begin.    You  will  need  to  unmute 
your audio by clicking the microphone icon.  When 
you are called upon to speak, start talking, pause for 
a moment, and then continue, so give the audio time 
to “catch up.”  Be careful and courteous when others 
are  speaking;  if  you  cough,  rustle  papers,  or 
otherwise make noise, you may cut them off. 

F.  Proceedings  will  be  on  the  record.    The  Court’s 
standing  rules  prohibiting  video  and  audio 
recording  in  the  courtroom,  along  with  the  ban  on 
the use of cellphones generally, remain in effect.  You 
are  prohibited  from  recording  the  proceedings  in

in 
including,  without 
limitation, other witnesses and the party for whom 
you are testifying or their attorney.  If anyone other 
than the Court attempts to contact you via the chat 
feature, notify the Court immediately.   

H.  If  witnesses  are  to  be  sequestered,  the  Court  will 
move you back to the virtual waiting room, and then 
recall  you  when  it  is  time  for  you  to  testify.

otherwise  view  or  listen  to  the  proceedings  in 
breach of the sequestration. 

1.  Attorneys,  parties,  and  other  witnesses  are 
further prohibited from communicating with you 
in  any  fashion  while  you  are  sequestered, 
whether  via  the  chat  feature,  telephone,  text,  e-
mail, or otherwise. 

2.  You  are not permitted  to  hold or  refer  to  notes, 
paperwork,  or  other  materials  while  testifying.  
All  testimony  must  be  from  memory,  unless 
otherwise directed by the Court. 

I.  The  Court  may  use  breakout  rooms  for  sidebar 
discussions with counsel.  The Court may shift you 
back  to  the  virtual  waiting  room  while  such 
discussions occur, and will bring you back into the 
virtual courtroom when ready.   

J.  Do  not 

leave 

the  meeting  under  any 
circumstances  until 
the  proceedings  are 
concluded.  This would be the same as walking out

dismissed.

B.  Depending  on  the  situation  and  the  location  of  the 
child,  you  may  be  asked  to  appear  from  the  same 
location  as  the  child  (i.e.,  on  the  same  device).  
Whether  you  appear  jointly  or  separate,  you  will 
need to provide additional assistance and guidance 
to  the  child  during  the  proceedings  than  usual.  
Specifically, you will need to go over the relevant 
portions of these Protocols with the child before 
the  proceeding.    These  Protocols  are  set  up  for 
proceedings  with  all  participants  appearing  from 
separate  locations,  and  with  the  child  appearing 
before the Court.  If this is not the case, some of these 
Protocols will be inapplicable.  Apply common sense 
as appropriate. 

C.  The  Meeting  ID  and  password  are  included  in  the 
Notice.    Join  the  meeting  at  least  5  minutes  before 
the scheduled time.  Unless prior approval has been 
granted by the Court, you must appear by video, as 
opposed to voice only.   

D.  When  you join the meeting you will be in a virtual

B.  Note that while Zoom also has an alternative option 
to use a telephone to call in to a meeting and appear 
by  audio  only,  you  may  not  appear  in  this  manner 
without the prior approval of the Court.  

 

E.  When  you  enter  the  virtual  courtroom,  your  video 
will automatically be on and your audio muted.  You 
will  need  to  unmute  your  audio  by  clicking  the

to “catch up.”  Be careful and courteous when others 
are  speaking;  if  you  cough,  rustle  papers,  or 
otherwise make noise, you may cut them off.   

G.  Wait  until  questions  are  completed  before 
announcing  an  objection.    Do  not  interrupt  or  talk 
over witnesses or opposing counsel.  Because of the 
way the Zoom app gives primacy to the most recent 
speaker,  speaking  over  others  cuts  off  their  audio.  
The usual vigorous back-and-forth between counsel 
needs  to  be  slowed  down  so  all  can  be  heard, 
allowing the Court to make appropriate rulings. 

H.  You  may  confer  with  or  provide  notes  to  the  child 
using  the  private  chat  feature.    To  do  so,  hit  the 
“CHAT”  button,  and  at  the  bottom  of  the  chat 
window,  pull-down  the  recipient  arrow  and  select 
the child’s name.  You may not chat, text, or  in any 
way  confer  with  the  child  during  his  or  her 
testimony.    You  are  not  to  use  the  private  chat 
feature  with  any  non-client  witnesses  or  opposing 
counsel.   

I. 

If you need to have a private conversation with the 
child, the Court will move you both into a separate, 
confidential  “breakout  room,”  while  keeping  the 
primary  meeting  open.    The  Court  will  not  at  any 
time enter the breakout room, and conversations in 
these rooms are not recorded in any way.  When you 
are ready to return to the virtual courtroom be sure 
to  click  “return  to  main  session,”  as  opposed  to 
“leave meeting.”   

J.  The Court may also use breakout rooms for sidebar 
discussions  with  counsel,  for  private  discussions 
in-
between  counsel,  and  to  conduct  virtual 
chambers interviews of minor children.   

K.  Proceedings  will  be  on  the  record.    The  Court’s 
standing  rules  prohibiting  video  and  audio 
recording  in  the  courtroom,  along  with  the  ban  on 
the use of cellphones generally, remain in effect.  All 
proceedings  are  being  recorded  by  the  Court

any other proceeding. 

L.  No  one  is  to  annotate  anyone  else's  shared  screen 
unless expressly permitted or directed by the Court 
to do so.   

V.  ZOOM MEETING APP 

A.  Visit zoom.us and create an account.  You must use 
your  real  name 
in  setting  up  your  Zoom 
account.  You should also download and install the 
app  on  your  computer,  tablet,  or  smartphone, 
depending on the device or devices you intend to use 
for  your  appearance.    (You  can  do  this  by  clicking 
Resources,  and  selecting  Install  Client  or  App).    If 
you  cannot  figure  out  how  to  do  it,  just  remember

waiting  room  with  all  other  parties,  attorneys  and 
witnesses.    There  may  be  several  cases  set  on  the 
docket at that time.  When the case you are testifying 
in is called, the Court will bring you into the virtual 
courtroom.  

E.  When  you  enter  the  virtual  courtroom,  your  video 
will automatically be on and your audio muted, until 
the  proceedings  begin.    You  will  need  to  unmute 
your audio by clicking the microphone icon.  When 
you are called upon to speak, start talking, pause for 
a moment, and then continue, so give the audio time 
to “catch up.”  Be careful and courteous when others 
are  speaking;  if  you  cough,  rustle  papers,  or 
otherwise make noise, you may cut them off. 

F.  Proceedings  will  be  on  the  record.    The  Court’s 
standing  rules  prohibiting  video  and  audio 
recording  in  the  courtroom,  along  with  the  ban  on 
the use of cellphones generally, remain in effect.  You 
are  prohibited  from  recording  the  proceedings  in 
any way.  All proceedings are being recorded by the 
Court Reporter.

G.  You may not use the chat feature to message anyone 
in 
including,  without 
limitation, other witnesses and the party for whom 
you are testifying or their attorney.  If anyone other 
than the Court attempts to contact you via the chat 
feature, notify the Court immediately.   

H.  If  witnesses  are  to  be  sequestered,  the  Court  will 
move you back to the virtual waiting room, and then 
recall  you  when  it  is  time  for  you  to  testify.  
Sequestered  witnesses  are  not  permitted  to  watch 
the public livestream (if any) during the hearing, or 
otherwise  view  or  listen  to  the  proceedings  in 
breach of the sequestration. 

1.  Attorneys,  parties,  and  other  witnesses  are 
further prohibited from communicating with you 
in  any  fashion  while  you  are  sequestered, 
whether  via  the  chat  feature,  telephone,  text,  e-
mail, or otherwise.
