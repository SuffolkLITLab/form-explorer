Appellant 

 No. 2377 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered August 16, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County 
Criminal Division at CP-51-CR-0500771-2003 

EFORE:   MURRAY, J., KING, J., and PELLEGRINI, J.* 

MEMORANDUM BY MURRAY, J.:                               FILED MARCH 22, 2023 

Francisco Guzman (Appellant) appeals pro se from the order dismissing 

as untimely his third petition filed pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act 

(PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9541-9546.  We affirm. 

In 2006, a jury convicted Appellant of first-degree murder and related 

offenses  arising  from  Appellant’s  shooting  of  two  men  in  retaliation  for  an 

unpaid drug debt.  The trial court sentenced Appellant to life in prison on April 

10, 2006.  This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence, and the Supreme 

Court  of  Pennsylvania  denied  allowance  of  appeal.    Commonwealth  v. 

Guzman,  932  A.2d  253  (Pa.  Super.  2007)  (unpublished  memorandum),

appeal denied, 952 A.2d 675 (Pa. 2008).  Appellant did not file a petition for 

writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.  

Appellant filed a first PCRA petition in June 2008.  The PCRA court denied 

relief, and this Court affirmed.  See Commonwealth v. Guzman, 788 EDA 

2011 (Pa. Super. 2012) (unpublished memorandum).  Appellant did not seek 

allowance of appeal with the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.   

Appellant  filed  a  second  PCRA  petition  in  September  2017,  which  the 

PCRA court dismissed as untimely.  Appellant did not appeal. 

On  March  10,  2020,  Appellant  pro  se  filed  the  instant  PCRA  petition.  

Appellant  claimed  he  had  recently  discovered  new,  exculpatory  evidence, 

relayed in an affidavit from a potential witness, Teddy Gonzalez (Gonzalez).1  

Gonzalez asserted in relevant part: 

I personally know [Appellant] as “Pete.”  There has never been a 
monetary dispute between Pete and I.  On or about December 13, 
2000, I personally paid the full amount due to Pete, thus instantly 
concluding the matter to our satisfaction.  To my knowledge, Pete 
and I have prior to and afterwards remained on agreeable terms.  
…  I recently learned from Pete that a false motive was used to 
convict him: specifically involving the money owed.  The basis for 
that,  however,  cannot  be  true  since  there  had  never  been  a 
monetary dispute between [Pete] and I. 
 

Gonzalez Affidavit, 5/14/19 (paragraph numbering and breaks omitted). 

Appellant  claimed  Gonzalez’s  affidavit  met  the  requirements  of  the 

newly-discovered  fact  exception  to  the  PCRA’s  time  bar,  codified  at  42 

____________________________________________ 

1 Gonzalez did not testify at Appellant’s trial.

J-S04004-23 

Appellant: 

Pa.C.S.A.  §  9545(b)(1)(ii).    PCRA  Petition,  3/10/20,  at  2-4.2    According  to 

At the time of [Appellant’s] trial, [] Gonzalez, (the man who the 
prosecutor argued had owed [Appellant] money) was and is willing 
to  testify  that  he  had  not  owed  me  money  and  remained  on 
agreeable terms with me throughout the years. 
 

Id.  at  4.    Appellant  claimed  the  affidavit  established  Appellant’s  innocence 

because Appellant had no motive to commit the crimes.  See id.; see also 

Commonwealth Brief at 7 (clarifying Appellant “maintained Gonzalez would be 

able to contradict what [Appellant] alleged to be the prosecution’s theory that 

Gonzalez owed money to [Appellant] at the time of the shooting.”). 

On  April  21,  2022,  the  PCRA  court  issued  Pa.R.Crim.P.  907  notice  of 

intent to dismiss Appellant’s petition without an evidentiary hearing.  The court 

opined  that  it  lacked  jurisdiction  because  the  petition  was  untimely  and  did 

not meet a timeliness exception.  Notice, 4/21/22.  Appellant filed a pro se 

response to the Rule 907 notice.  He claimed the “PCRA Court [] overlooked 

and/or misinterpreted the 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(ii)” timeliness exception.  

Response,  5/12/22,  at  1  (unnumbered).    Appellant  further  asserted, 

“[a]lthough  Mr.  Gonzalez’s  name  was  brought  up  numerous  …  [times  at 

Appellant’s  trial]  by  both  of  [the]  Commonwealth’s  key  witnesses,”  and 

____________________________________________ 

2 Appellant also claimed his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview 
Gonzalez.  See PCRA Petition, 3/10/20, at 8.  Appellant has abandoned this 
claim on appeal.

“[Gonzalez’s]  where  about  [sic]  was  never  found  until  2019….”    Id.  at  2 

The PCRA court dismissed Appellant’s PCRA petition on August 16, 2022.  

Appellant timely appealed.  The PCRA court did not order Appellant to file a 

Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement, although the court issued an opinion in 

support of its ruling on September 7, 2022. 

Appellant presents a single question for review:   

Whether  the  PCRA  Court  followed  the  rule  established  by  [the] 
Supreme  Court  of  Pennsylvania  and  effectuate[d]  the  General 
Assembly’s intent, as reflected in the statute’s language, when it 
held that an incarcerated pro se petitioner cannot be presumed to 
know facts merely because they are in the public record and ruled 
that  [a]  hearing  was  necessary  to  determine  whether  the 
petitioner acted with due diligence? 
 

Appellant’s Brief at 3. 

Preliminarily, we are mindful that: 

Appellate review of a PCRA court’s dismissal of a PCRA petition is 
limited  to  the  examination  of  whether  the  PCRA  court’s 
determination is supported by the record and free of legal error.  
The PCRA court’s findings will not be disturbed unless there is no 
support for the findings in the certified record.  This Court grants 
great deference to the findings of the PCRA court, and we will not 
disturb those findings merely because the record could support a 
contrary holding.  In contrast, we review the PCRA court’s legal 
conclusions de novo.

(citations omitted).

All PCRA petitions, including a second or subsequent petition, must be 

filed  within  one  year  of  the  date  that  the  petitioner’s  judgment  of  sentence 

- 4 - 

J-S04004-23 

(unnumbered). 

J-S04004-23 

becomes final.  42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(1); Commonwealth v. Derrickson, 

923 A.2d 466, 468 (Pa. Super. 2007).  A judgment of sentence becomes final 

“at  the  conclusion  of  direct  review,  including  discretionary  review  in  the 

Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 

or  at  the  expiration  of  time  for  seeking  the  review.”    42  Pa.C.S.A. 

§ 9545(b)(3).    “If  a  PCRA  petition  is  untimely,  neither  this  Court  nor  the 

[PCRA] court has jurisdiction over the petition.”  Commonwealth v. Chester, 

895 A.2d 520, 522 (Pa. 2006) (citation omitted).  

Appellant’s  judgment  of  sentence  became  final  in  2008,  after  the 

expiration of time to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States 

Supreme Court.  See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(3); see also U.S.Sup.Ct.R. 13.  

Thus, Appellant’s petition is untimely unless he has satisfied one of the PCRA’s 

three exceptions contained in Section 9545(b)(1)(i – iii).  Any petition invoking 

an exception “shall be filed within one year of the date the claim could have 

been presented.”  42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9545(b)(2). 

Appellant  invokes  the  newly-discovered  fact  exception  in  Section 

9545(b)(1)(ii).  We have explained this exception 

requires  a  petitioner  to  demonstrate  he  did  not  know  the  facts 
upon which he based his petition and could not have learned those 
facts  earlier  by  the  exercise  of  due  diligence.    Due  diligence 
demands that the petitioner take reasonable steps to protect his 
own interests.   A petitioner must explain why he could not 
have  learned  the  new  fact(s)  earlier  with  the  exercise  of 
due diligence.  This rule is strictly enforced.  Additionally, the 
focus of this exception is on the newly discovered facts, not on a 
newly  discovered  or  newly  willing  source  for  previously  known 
facts.

omitted; emphasis added). 

Commonwealth v. Brown, 111 A.3d 171, 176 (Pa. Super. 2015) (citations 

 

 Appellant  argues  the  PCRA  court  improperly  dismissed  his  petition 

because  Gonzalez’s  affidavit  satisfied  the  newly-discovered  fact  exception.  

See Appellant’s Brief at 9-16.  Appellant claims the affidavit undermines the 

Commonwealth’s  theory  “about  unpaid  debts  between  []  Gonzalez  and 

[A]ppellant,”  and  establishes  Appellant’s  “actual[]  innocence  of  the  crimes 

charged.”  Id. at 10.  According to Appellant, the PCRA court “disregard[ed 

the]  words  of”  Section  9545(b)(1)(ii),  and  should  have  conducted  an 

evidentiary hearing before dismissing his petition.  Id. at 12.  Appellant claims 

Section 9545(b)(1)(ii)  

establishes  a  reasonableness  inquiry  from  the  Appellant’s 
viewpoint;  this  requires  assessing  all  relevant  facts  before 
determining  whether  the  Appellant  acted  diligently,  rather  than 
applying a presumption of knowledge that stops the inquiry before 
it begins. 
 

Id. 

 

The Commonwealth counters,  

[Appellant] stated [in his PCRA petition] that “[a]t the time of the 
trial, [] Gonzalez (the man who the prosecutor argued had owed 
me money) was and is willing to testify.”  (PCRA, 3/10/2020, at 
4)  (emphasis  added).    However,  the  fact  that  [Appellant]  knew 
Gonzalez, who [Appellant] said had been willing to testify at trial, 
is  fatal  to  [Appellant’s]  claim  of  an  after-discovered  fact.    If 
Gonzalez were now to testify in keeping with his affidavit, nothing 
he says would have been unknown to [Appellant] at the time of 
trial.  [Appellant] knew Gonzalez and would have known that he 
could  refute  what  [Appellant]  claims  was  the  Commonwealth’s 
theory of the case regarding his motive. 

- 6 - 

J-S04004-23 

 

court explained: 

Commonwealth Brief at 7-8 (citation modified). 

 

The PCRA court similarly concluded Appellant failed to demonstrate that 

the  information  in  Gonzalez’s  affidavit  was  previously  unknown.    The  PCRA 

[T]he  purported  “fact”  that  Gonzalez’s  monetary  debt  was 
satisfactorily  resolved  in  2000,  if  true,  clearly  would  have  been 
known  to  [Appellant].    Thus,  Gonzalez’s  memorialization  of 
information known to [Appellant] for nearly two decades did not 
constitute new “facts” satisfying subsection 9545(b)(1)(ii).   See 
Commonwealth  v.  Marshall,  947  A.2d  714,  720  (Pa.  2008) 
(holding that the focus of section 9545(b)(1)(ii) “is on the newly 
discovered facts, not on a newly discovered or newly willing source 
for previously known facts”). 

ven  if  [Appellant]  was  somehow  unaware  that  Gonzalez 
[had]  repaid  his  debt,  [Appellant]  failed  to  demonstrate  that 
Gonzalez’s statement could not, with the exercise of due diligence, 
have been obtained for over a decade.  [See Brown, supra (“A 
petitioner  must  explain  why  he  could  not  have  learned  the  new 
fact(s) earlier with the exercise of due diligence.”).]  Despite their 
agreeable  relationship,  [Appellant]  neither  detailed  any  attempt 
to  contact  Gonzalez  nor  explained  why  such  efforts  would  have 
been  unsuccessful.    Moreover,  Gonzalez  did  not  express  any 
reluctance to provide a statement earlier.  Thus, [Appellant] failed 
to even attempt to establish the due diligence prong of subsection 
9545(b)(1)(ii). 

  E

 

PCRA Court Opinion, 9/7/22, at 1-2. 

 

We agree with the Commonwealth and PCRA court.  We further observe 

that  the  PCRA  court  did  not  err  in  declining  to  hold  an  evidentiary  hearing.  

The right 

to  an  evidentiary  hearing  on  a  post-conviction  petition  is  not 
absolute.  It is within the PCRA court’s discretion to decline to hold 
a hearing if the petitioner’s claim is patently frivolous and has no 
support either in the record or other evidence.

untimely PCRA petition.
