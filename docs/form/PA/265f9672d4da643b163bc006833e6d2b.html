Foreword
by
Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania 

 
Restitution  as  a  manner  of  compensating  victims  can  be  found  in  the  earliest 
examples of written law, including the Code of Hammurabi and the Torah.  Compensation 
was often scaled according to the perceived harm caused, and was intended to supplant 
interpersonal violence borne of vengeance.  In many early societies, no distinction was 
made between private and public harm, or between criminal and civil acts. Courts were 
focused  on  restoration,  and  often  had  great  latitude  in  assigning  the  compensation 
deemed appropriate to satisfy the victim and restore community equilibrium. 

Over time, the role of courts evolved as the compensatory purpose of restitution 
  
came  to  be  recognized  as  secondary  to  the  purpose  of  rehabilitating  the  offender. 
Restitution  became  encouraged  as  a  way  to  impress  upon  the  offender  the  egregious 
nature of the conduct and the offender’s responsibility for it, to deter repeat malfeasance, 
and to encourage individuals to live in a responsible way. 

Benchbook

 
The  considerations  in  determining  appropriate  restitution  continue  to  evolve 
  illustrates.    In  2016,  upon  recommendation  of  the  Criminal 
today,  as  this 
Procedural Rules Committee, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court modified several rules of 
criminal procedure toward the end of standardizing how restitution is awarded in those 
cases. The Committee’s work was informed by recommendations from the Restitution in 
Pennsylvania Task Force.  The Task Force, convened in 2011 by the Pennsylvania Office 
of the Victim Advocate, was charged with identifying, “solutions to increase the quality 
of restitution services at the state and county levels.”   Criminal justice partners from 
the judicial, legislative and executive branches collaborated in the effort.  In their 2013 
Final Report, the Task Force identified important considerations and best practices in 
managing restitution. 

 
Now, in 2020, the Supreme Court and the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania 
Courts provide this concise, practical guide for trial judges issuing orders of restitution.  
And although the Benchbook is written primarily for trial court judges, appellate court 
judges also may find the information useful. Similarly, both new and experienced judges 
should find value.

Benchbook

The 

  details  the  applicable  statutes,  rules,  and  case  law,  and  offers 
 
perspectives  from  experienced  judges  on  issues  that  can  arise  in  restitution  cases.  It 
provides guidance on common questions surrounding the mandatory nature of restitution.  
Importantly, it also addresses matters that are not routine, such as how bankruptcy affects 
an order of restitution, and the applicability of restitution in cases where the recipient is 
an entity other than a person, or a person other than the actual victim.

Introduction

 

I.    SCOPE OF BENCHBOOK

 
This benchbook is designed to assist judges in providing an overview of the law and 
procedure relating to restitution in adult and juvenile cases. When possible, procedural 
checklists  have  been  included.    Chapter  I  covers  basic  principles  and  concepts  when 
restitution must be addressed in an adult or juvenile criminal prosecution. 

Chapter Two examines the imposition of restitution at the sentencing phase of an 

 
adult criminal matter.

Chapter Three addresses the imposition of restitution as a condition of probation in 

 
an adult criminal prosecution. 

Chapter Four examines the imposition of restitution in the dispositional phase of a 

 
juvenile prosecution.

 
Also included are crimes which have specific restitution provisions. 

Chapter Five is a collection of enabling statutes and rules which address restitution.  
II.     LEGAL PRINCIPLES OF RESTITUTION

 

 

A. Basic Concepts of Restitution

Commonwealth v. Petrick,

 
In  the  context  of  criminal  proceedings,  the  primary  purpose  of  restitution  is 
Commonwealth v. 
rehabilitation of the offender by impressing on him the fact that his actions damaged the 
Ramos
victim.  

 217 A.3d 1217, 1224 (Pa. 2019); 

, 197 A.3d 766, 769 (Pa. Super. 2018).  

It  is  well  established  that  the  primary  purpose  of  restitution  is 
rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him or her that his 
criminal conduct caused the victim’s loss or personal injury and that it 
is his responsibility to repair the loss or injury as far as possible. Thus, 
recompense  to  the  victim  is  only  a  secondary  benefit,  as  restitution 
is not an award of damages. Although restitution is penal  in nature, 
it  is  highly  favored  in  the  law  and  encouraged  so  that  the  criminal 
will understand the egregiousness of his or her conduct, be deterred 
from repeating the conduct, and be encouraged to live in a responsible 
 533 Pa. 14, 22, 617 A.2d 702, 706–07 
way. 

Commonwealth v. Harner,

2      Chapter 1      

Introduction

(1992). Thus, restitution, at its core, involves concepts of rehabilitation 
and deterrence.

Commonwealth v. Brown

, 981 A.2d 893, 895-896 (Pa. 2009)(citations omitted).

 
Restitution  is  a  creature  of  statute  and,  without  express  legislative  direction,  a 
Commonwealth v. Kinnan
court  is  powerless  to  direct  a  defendant  to  make  restitution  as  part  of  his  sentence. 
, 71 A.3d 983, 986 (Pa. Super. 2013). Where that statutory 
authority  exists,  however,  the  imposition  of  restitution  is  vested  within  the  sound 
discretion of the sentencing judge. 

Id.

The trial court is authorized to order restitution pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9721 as 

 
follows:

§ 9721. Sentencing generally

(a)  General  rule.--In  determining  the  sentence  to  be  imposed,  the 
court shall, except as provided in subsection (a.1), consider and select 
one  or  more  of  the  following  alternatives,  and  may  impose  them 
consecutively or concurrently:

(1) An order of probation.
(2) A determination of guilt without further penalty.
(3) Partial confinement.
(4) Total confinement.
(5) A fine.
. . .

(c)  Mandatory  restitution.--In  addition  to  the  alternatives  set  forth 
in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  the  court  shall  order  the  defendant 
to  compensate  the  victim  of  his  criminal  conduct  for  the  damage  or 
injury  that  he  sustained.  For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  the  term 
“victim” shall be as defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 
(P.L. 177, No. 175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929.

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9721.

 
Two scenarios implicate the statutory authority for restitution: (1) as part of a direct 
sentence, or (2) as a condition of probation. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106 and 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 
9763(b)(10), respectively.

Previously,  Pennsylvania  legislation  also  provided  for  a  restitution  order  in 
 
intermediate punishment sentences.  However, effective December 18, 2019, Title 42 was 
amended and repealed the provisions for state and county intermediate punishment, 

3      Chapter 1      

Introduction

replacing each with similar programs, but neither mentions a separate grant of authority 
to order restitution distinct from the two provisions stated above. 

Additionally, the provisions regarding restitution in probationary sentences were 
 
renumbered and moved from 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9754 to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763.  All of the cases 
cited in this benchbook refer to the prior version of Section 9754; however, in light of 
the  similarities  in  the  two  sections,  the  cases  construing  the  prior  version  should  be 
1
considered applicable to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763. 

 

The regulations governing the Sentencing Guidelines also address restitution:

(1) Restitution shall be added to any guideline sentence, as authorized 
by law. Relevant statutes include but are not limited to:
(i) 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106 (relating to injuries to person or property)
(ii) 18 Pa.C.S. § 1107 (relating to theft of timber)
(iii) 18 Pa.C.S. § 1107.1 (relating to restitution for identity theft)
(iv) 18 Pa.C.S. § 1110 (relating to restitution for cleanup of clandestine 
laboratories)
(v)  18  P.S.  §  11.1302  (relating  to  restitution  to  the  Office  of  Victim 
Services)
(vi) 42 Pa.C.S. § 9721(c) (relating to mandatory restitution)

(2) Restitution may be imposed as a direct sentence or as a condition 
of  probation  or  intermediate  punishment,  and  is  considered  a  non-
confinement  sentencing  alternative  (see  restorative  sanction  § 
303.9(f)).

Restitution is authorized by Section 1106 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106.

that various entities are entitled to receive restitution:

§ 1106. Restitution for injuries to person or property

(a) General rule. — Upon conviction for any crime wherein:

(1)  property  of  a  victim  has  been  stolen,  converted  or  otherwise 
unlawfully  obtained,  or  its  value  substantially  decreased  as  a  direct 
result of the crime; or

other government agency but shall order the defendant to pay any 
restitution ordered for loss previously compensated by the board to 
the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund or other designated account 
when  the  claim  involves  a  government  agency  in  addition  to  or  in 
place of the board. The court shall not reduce a restitution award by 
any amount that the victim has received from an insurance company 
but shall order the defendant to pay any restitution ordered for loss 
previously compensated by an insurance company to the insurance 
company.

(ii)  If  restitution  to  more  than  one  victim  is  set  at  the  same  time, 
the court shall set priorities of payment. However, when establishing 
priorities, the court shall order payment in the following order:

(B) The Crime Victim’s Compensation Board.
(C) Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement 
to the victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct.

Commonwealth v. Whatley

 

A “Victim” is defined in Section 1106 as follows:

“Victim.” As defined in section 103 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L. 
882, No. 111), known as the Crime Victims Act. The term includes an 
affected government agency, the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund, 
if  compensation  has  been  paid  by  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation 
Fund to the victim, any insurance company that has compensated the 
victim for loss under an insurance contract and any business entity.

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(h). The Crime Victim’s Act defines “Victim” as:

“Victim.” The term means the following:
(1) A direct victim.
(2) A parent or legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim, except 
when the parent or legal guardian of the child is the alleged offender.
(3)  A  minor  child  who  is  a  material  witness  to  any  of  the  following 
crimes and offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to crimes and offenses) 
committed or attempted against a member of the child’s family:
Chapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide).
Section 2702 (relating to aggravated assault).
Section 3121 (relating to rape).
(4) A family member of a homicide victim, including stepbrothers or 
stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a fiance, one of whom is to be 
identified to receive communication as provided for in this act, except 
where the family member is the alleged offender.

(2) At the time of sentencing the court shall specify the amount and 
method  of  restitution.  In  determining  the  amount  and  method  of 
restitution, the court:

(i)  Shall  consider  the  extent  of  injury  suffered  by  the  victim,  the 
victim’s request for restitution as presented to the district attorney 
in  accordance  with  paragraph  (4)  and  such  other  matters  as  it 
deems appropriate.

Commonwealth v. Holmes

In  imposing  an  order  of  probation,  the  trial  court  is  empowered  to  require  the 

 
defendant to make restitution pursuant to 42 PA.C.S.A. § 9763, which states: 

(a) General rule.

— In imposing probation, the court shall consider 
guidelines  adopted  by  the  Pennsylvania  Commission  on  Sentencing 
under section 2154 (relating to adoption of guidelines for sentencing) 
or  2154.1  (relating  to  adoption  of  guidelines  for  restrictive 
conditions)  and  specify  at  the  time  of  sentencing  the  conditions  of 
probation,  including  the  length  of  the  term  of  restrictive  conditions 
under subsection (c) or (d). The term of restrictive conditions under 
subsection  (c)  shall  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  mandatory 
minimum term of imprisonment required by statute.

In 2019, the Legislature, in reference to probation, moved the condition of restitution from 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9754(c)(8) to Section 9763(b)
(10). The language used in Section 9763(b)(10) is similar to the prior section.

7      Chapter 1      

Introduction

  When restitution is imposed as a condition of probation pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. 
§ 9763(b)(10), its purpose is to rehabilitate the defendant and provide some redress 
to the victim. This gives the sentencing court the flexibility to fashion the condition to 
  617 A.2d 702, 706 (Pa. 1992). 
rehabilitate the defendant. 
Therefore,  the  requirement  of  a  nexus  between  the  loss  and  amount  of  restitution  is 
relaxed. See 

, 80 A.3d 1204, 1215 (Pa. 2013). 

Commonwealth v.  Harner,

Commonwealth v. Hall

Notably, restitution imposed under section 9763 differs from restitution imposed 
 
4
under section 1106
  (as part of a direct sentence) in that it requires a court to explicitly 
Commonwealth  v. 
consider  a  defendant’s  ability  to  pay  when  it  initially  imposes  the  total  amount  of 
Whatley
restitution,  which  cannot  exceed  the  loss  suffered  by  the  victim. 

, 221 A.3d 651 (Pa. Super. 2019)(decided under 42 Pa.C.S.A.  § 9754).

Furthermore, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106 provides that a defendant’s compliance with an 

 
order of restitution may be a condition of probation or parole:

(b) Condition of probation or parole.--Whenever restitution has been 
ordered pursuant to subsection (a) and the offender has been placed 
on  probation  or  parole,  the  offender’s  compliance  with  such  order 
may be made a condition of such probation or parole.

some amount and method of restitution at the initial sentencing, and the requirements 
of Section 1106(c)(3) are met.  
, 197 A.3d 766, 779 (Pa. Super. 
2018).    However,  a  generalized,  open-ended  restitution  order  at  sentencing  with  the 
intent  to  “work  out  the  details  and  amount  later”  constitutes  an  illegal  sentence,  as 
would a sentencing court’s delegation to the probation department or another agency 
to determine the amount of restitution. 

If  the  initial  sentencing  order  satisfies  two,  inextricable  components  which  are 

 
derived from Section 1106(c), it can be modified at a later date: 

the time at which a restitution sentence must be imposed, that is, at 
the sentencing hearing; and the specific nature of such a sentence, that 
is, definite as to amount and method of payment.

We  recognize  the  tension  between  having  finality  in  the  restitution 
order at sentencing and the desire to have a sentence imposed speedily. 
Rule  704  of  the  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure  requires  imposition  of 
a  sentence  within  90  days  of  conviction  or  the  entry  of  a  plea.  See 
Pa.R.Crim.P.  704(A)(1).  However,  full  restitution  amounts  are  often 
undeterminable  within  the  90–day  period.  The  Comment  to  Rule 
704 recognizes this and provides that if the full amount of restitution 
cannot be determined at the time of sentencing, the judge should state 
on the record the basis for determining the amount set at sentencing. 
.,  cmt.  ¶  20  (“In  all  cases  in  which  restitution  is  imposed,  the 
See 
sentencing judge must state on the record the amount of restitution, if 
determined at the time of sentencing, or the basis for determining an 
amount of restitution.”). Further, the legislature provides sentencing 
courts broad authority to amend restitution orders at any time, if the 
court provides its reasons for doing so as a matter of record. See 18 
Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(3).

Commonwealth v. Dietrich

 

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(3) provides:

(3)  The  court  may,  at  any  time  or  upon  the  recommendation  of  the 
district attorney that is based on information received from the victim 
and  the  probation  section  of  the  county  or  other  agent  designated 
by the county commissioners of the county with the approval of the 
president  judge  to  collect  restitution,  alter  or  amend  any  order  of 
restitution made pursuant to paragraph (2), provided, however, that 
the court states its reasons and conclusions as a matter of record for 
any change or amendment to any previous order.

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c).

Therefore, modification is especially apt following a plea and immediate sentencing.  
 
However,  the  Commonwealth  must  still  be  prepared  to  present  the  sentencing  court 
with  the  necessary  evidence  to  support  the  imposition  of  restitution  at  the  time  of

of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c).
 

B.  The Restitution Hearing

 
The  Commonwealth  has  the  burden  to  prove  the  amount  of  “full  restitution.”  18 
Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1).  Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 705.1, which addresses 
restitution, became effective on July 1, 2016. The rule provides:

 

Rule 705.1. Restitution

(A)   At the time of sentencing, the judge shall determine what restitution, if any,   
         shall be imposed.

(B)   In any case in which restitution is imposed, the judge shall state in the sentencing   
        order:

1)    the amount of restitution ordered;
2)    the details of a payment plan, if any, including when   
         payment is to begin;
3)    the identity of the payee(s);
4)    to which officer or agency the restitution payment shall      
         be made;
5)    whether any restitution has been paid and in what 
         amount; and
6)    whether the restitution has been imposed as a part of the 
         sentence and/or as a condition of probation.

Pa.R.Crim.P. 705.1

 
In all cases in which restitution is imposed, the sentencing judge must state on the 
record the amount of restitution at the time of sentencing, whether it is a result of direct 
sentence or a probationary sentence.

The  plain  text  of  the  statute  requires  the  trial  court  to  specify  the 
amount of restitution at the time of the original sentencing as well as a 
method of payment. [18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(2).] In addition, our cases 
unequivocally  hold  that  “[t]he  [trial]  court  [is]  not  free  to  delegate 
these duties to an agency.”

2002).

, 801 A.2d 1254, 1257 (Pa. Super. 

  When determining the amount of restitution, Section 1106(c)(2) requires a hearing 
at the trial court level by directing the trial court to  “consider the extent of injury suffered 
by the victim, the victim’s request for restitution as presented to the district attorney. . . 
and such other matters as it deems appropriate.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(2)(i). 

The Superior Court explained how a trial court should compute a restitution award 

 
as follows:

Although  restitution  does  not  seek,  by  its  essential  nature,  the 
compensation  of  the  victim,  the  dollar  value  of  the  injury  suffered 
by the victim as a result of the crime assists the court in calculating 
the appropriate amount of restitution. A restitution award must not 
exceed  the  victim’s  losses.  A  sentencing  court  must  consider  the 
victim’s  injuries,  the  victim’s  request  as  presented  by  the  district 
attorney and such other matters as the court deems appropriate. The 
court must also ensure that the record contains the factual basis for 
the  appropriate  amount  of  restitution.  In  that  way,  the  record  will 
support the sentence.

C.  Restitution as a Direct Sentence vs. Restitution as a Condition of Probation

 

 

Restitution pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a) is limited to:

(1)  Property of a victim if it has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully 

(2)  The value of the aforesaid property if it has been substantially decreased as 

obtained; or

a direct result of the crime; or

(3)  For the personal injury of the victim if directly resulting from the crime.

 
Restitution  as  a  condition  of  probation  under  42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  9763  is  for  “loss  or 
damage caused by the crime.”  Although this statute includes the word “caused,” it does 
not contain the language directly resulting from the crime as does 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a). 
Case law has made clear that there is a significance to this difference in language. 

Specifically,  when  restitution  is  imposed  as  a  condition  of  probation  under  42 
 
Pa.C.S.A.  §  9763(b)(10),  rather  than  a  direct  sentence  under  the  Crimes  Code,  cases 
decided under the prior law stated that there need not be a direct nexus between offense 
and loss.  While restitution cannot be indiscriminate, an “indirect connection between

is penal in nature and 
 
See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(i) (court shall order restitution “[r]egardless of the current 
financial resources of the defendant”). 
Probation:

 The addition of conditions to an order of probation, including restitution, 
is primarily directed at  rehabilitative goals and is intended to assist the defendant in 
leading a law-abiding life. In this context, restitution is imposed for losses or damages 
caused by the crime, and is to be set “in an affordable amount and on a schedule that the 
defendant can afford to pay.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10). 

 
An  order  for  restitution  as  a  direct  sentence  continues  past  any  period  of 
Commonwealth v. Griffiths
supervision, while restitution ordered as a condition of probation terminates at the end 
of the probationary period. In 
, 15 A.3d 73 (Pa. Super. 2010), 
the  Superior  Court  stated,  in  dicta,  that  “an  order  of  restitution  [as  a  direct  sentence 
under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106] is enforceable until paid.” 
, 15 A.3d at 78; see also 42 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9728(c) (“[n]otwithstanding [42 Pa.C.S.A. §] 6353 (relating to limitation on 
and change in place of commitment) or 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(2) (relating to restitution 
for injuries to person or property), the period of time during which such judgments shall 
have full effect may exceed the maximum term of imprisonment to which the offender 
could have been sentenced for the crimes of which he was convicted or the maximum 
term of confinement to which the offender was committed”).  

 Griffiths

Commonwealth v. Karth

Conversely,  when  restitution  is  ordered  as  a  condition  of  probation  under  42 
 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10), the restitution must be viewed as “a ‘condition’ that is required 
to be met in order to successfully complete . . . probation.”  
, 994 
A.2d 606, 610 (Pa. Super. 2010).  Therefore, “[o]nce the term of probation expires, so, 
too, must any conditions attached thereto,” including any condition requiring that the 
probationer pay restitution – regardless of whether the amount of restitution ordered 
en banc
has been paid in full.

) (plurality) (explaining that, when restitution is ordered as a condition

term of probation regardless of whether the obligation has been paid in full”).

restitution. 

 
If  restitution  is  imposed  as  a  condition  of  probation,  the  court  must  order  the 
defendant to pay the total amount of restitution “on a schedule that the defendant can 
afford to pay.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10). The same is also true for restitution imposed 
as a direct sentence:

In determining the amount 
order restitution in a lump sum, by monthly installments or according 
to such other schedule as it deems just.

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(2). Whenever a defendant is unable to pay restitution “in a single 
remittance,” the payment plan must be based on:

the  defendant’s  financial  resources,  the  defendant’s  ability  to  make 
restitution and reparations and the nature of the burden the payment 
will impose on the defendant.

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9730(b)(3). This statute also requires that payment plans be imposed after 
a hearing, so courts cannot, for example, simply apply a one-size fits-all approach to all

Introduction

Generally, the collection of restitution is by the County’s Probation Department. 42 
 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9728(a); 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(e). Although a sentence for restitution is to be 
considered a judgment in favor of the probation department, it is not a debt. However, the 
collection of restitution may be referred to a private collection agency. The sentencing 
court must make a determination that the offender is financially able to pay restitution 
before it may turn a delinquent account over to a private collection agency.  42 Pa.C.S.A. 
§ 9730(b)(2).

 
42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9728 provides that a “sentence . . . for restitution” shall be a “judgment 
in  favor  of  the  probation  department  upon  the  person  or  the  property  of  the  person 
sentenced or subject to the order.”  Subsection (c) further provides that “the period of 
time during which such judgments shall have full effect may exceed the maximum term 
of  imprisonment  to  which  the  offender  could  have  been  sentenced  for  the  crimes  of 
which he was convicted or the maximum term of confinement to which the offender was 
committed.” 

 
Restitution orders are automatically entered as civil judgments if the total amount—
combined with fines and costs—exceeds $1,000, and the clerk of courts has the option 
of doing so if the amount is less than $1,000. 

(1)    The  county  clerk  of  courts  shall,  upon  sentencing,  pretrial 
disposition  or  other  order,  transmit  to  the  prothonotary  certified 
copies  of  all  judgments  for  restitution,  reparation,  fees,  costs,  fines 
and penalties which, in the aggregate, exceed $1,000, and it shall be 
the duty of each prothonotary to enter and docket the same of record 
in his office and to index the same as judgments are indexed, without 
requiring the payment of costs as a condition precedent to the entry 
thereof.

(2)    The  clerk  of  courts,  in  consultation  with  other  appropriate 
governmental  agencies,  may  transmit  to  the  prothonotary  of  the 
respective  county  certified  copies  of  all  judgments  for  restitution, 
reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties which, in the aggregate, do 
not exceed $1,000, and, if so transmitted, it shall be the duty of each 
prothonotary to enter and docket the same of record in his office and 
to  index  the  same  as  judgments  are  indexed,  without  requiring  the 
payment of costs as a condition precedent to the entry thereof.

42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  9728(b).  This  process  is  automatic,  as  the  law  mandates  that  the  clerk 
of  courts  transmit  the  financial  information  to  the  civil  Prothonotary  for  entry  as  a 
judgment 

 
A court also, upon application by the Commonwealth, may enter a restraining order 
or  injunction,  require  the  execution  of  a  satisfactory  performance  bond,  or  take  any 
other action to preserve the availability of property which may be necessary to satisfy

an anticipated restitution order. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9728(e).  

 
The payment of restitution is addressed at 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9730 as follows, and now 
includes the use of credit and bank cards, as well as explicit authorization for a wage 
attachment: § 9730. Payment of court costs, restitution and fines

(a)  Method  of  payment

.--The  treasurer  of  each  county  may  allow 
the  use  of  credit  cards  and  bank  cards  in  the  payment  of  court 
costs,  restitution  and  fines  and  may  provide  for  automatic  periodic 
deductions  from  a  bank  account,  subject  to  the  agreement  of  the 
(a.1) Wage attachment
owner of the account.

.--A court may, at sentencing, assign an amount 
not greater than 25% of the defendant’s gross salary, wages or other 
earnings to be used for the payment of court costs, restitution or fines.

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9730. Courts may impose the wage attachment at the time of sentencing 
pursuant  to  §  9730  (a.1).  However,  post-sentencing,  courts  may  impose  a  wage 
attachment only following a hearing at which the court determines that the defendant 
 at § 9730(b)(2). If the defendant is unable to pay, the court 
is “financially able to pay.” 
cannot impose a wage attachment.

Id.

 
The  legislature  has  also  made  community  service  available  as  an  alternative  to 
paying  restitution,  but  only  if  the  court  finds  that  the  defendant  is  unable  to  pay.  42 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9730(b)(3). The statute specifies that such community service must be “just 
and practicable under the circumstances.” 

 
No less than 50% of the money that a defendant pays goes towards restitution, with 
the remaining moneys to be used to pay fees, costs, and other court-ordered obligations: 

(g.1)    Payment.--No  less  than  50%  of  all  moneys  collected  by  the 
county probation department or other agent designated by the county 
commissioners of the county with the approval of the president judge 
of  the  county  pursuant  to  subsection  (b)(1)  and  deducted  pursuant 
to  subsection  (b)(5)  shall,  until  the  satisfaction  of  the  defendant’s 
restitution  obligation,  be  used  to  pay  restitution  to  victims.  Any 
remaining moneys shall be used to pay fees, costs, fines, penalties and 
other court-ordered obligations.

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9728(g.1). 

 
However,  if the  sentencing  court does not  specify the percentage,  then  only  50% 
of  the  money  that  a  defendant  pays  goes  towards  restitution,  with  the  other  50% 
going towards fines and costs. See also 204 Pa. Code 29.353(I)(A)(3). The trial court, 
15      Chapter 1      

Introduction

however, can specify in its sentencing order that as much as 100% of payments first go 
to restitution until it is paid in full.

  Whenever  a  defendant  defaults  on  a  payment  plan,  the  court  has  the  authority 
to  enforce  its  restitution  order,  either  through  its  contempt  powers,  or—if  payment 
has been made a condition of probation—probation violation proceedings. The court 
must hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant is “financially able to pay.” 42 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9730(b). This hearing must occur before a defendant is punished, even if the 
court has previously held such a hearing:

Judges  must  hold  separate  hearings  for  each  alleged  contemnor  to 
ascertain  whether  any  noncompliance  flowed  from  (a)  deliberate 
disregard  of  the  court’s  order  or  (b)  circumstances  beyond  the 
defendant’s control. This must be done every time someone appears 
or  reappears  for  a  costs-and-fines  proceeding,  because  the  person’s 
financial situations may have changed since the last time she or he was 
before the court.
Commonwealth v. Mauk

, 185 A.3d 406, 411 (Pa. Super. 2018).

Bearden  v.  Georgia

Depending  on  the  outcome  of  that  hearing,  the  court  may  punish  the  defendant, 
modify the payment plan, or permit the defendant to perform community service. The 
critical  question,  which  Pennsylvania  courts  have  imported  from  the  U.S.  Supreme 
Court  question  in 
,  461  U.S.  660,  672-673  (1983),  is  whether  a 
defendant has “willfully” refused to pay. These issues are discussed at length later in 
this benchbook.

Procedures regarding default

In summary, if a defendant defaults in the payment of restitution after imposition of 
 
sentence, a hearing should be scheduled to determine whether the defendant is financially 
capable of making payments.  Section 9730(b), 
, allows 
for modification of a payment plan when the defendant’s circumstances have changed, 
and grants options to the sentencing court to alter the schedule of payments as is just and 
practicable under the circumstances.  The sentencing court may even consider replacing 
an order of restitution with community service if it is established that the defendant is 
unable to pay.

be raised by either the defendant or the Commonwealth.

In a recent decision, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court fully explained the differences 
in an appeal involving restitution and the challenge to a sentence which sounds in legality 
or the discretionary aspects of the sentence and the issue preservation implications of 
those determinations. In 
 --- A.3d ---, 2020 WL 5822534 (Pa. 
Oct. 1, 2020), the Supreme Court stated, in reference to a legality challenge:

Commonwealth v. Weir,

In the context of issue preservation principles, Section 1106 requires 
an  integrated  analysis  of  its  relevant  provisions.  Section  1106(a) 
is  mandatory  in  its  directive  and  removes  any  discretion  from  the 
sentencing court to impose restitution as punishment upon conviction 
of a crime under two circumstances: where the property of a victim 
has  been  stolen,  converted  or  otherwise  unlawfully  obtained  or  its 
value has been substantially decreased as a direct consequence of the 
crime, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a)(1), or where the victim, if an individual, 
suffered  personal  injury  resulting  from  the  crime,    18  Pa.C.S.A.  § 
1106(a)(2).  Thus,  the  failure  of  a  trial  court  to  impose  restitution 
where the circumstances described in Section 1106(a)(1) or (2) are 
established results in an illegal sentence. Conversely, and as relevant 
to  a  defendant’s  challenge,  if  the  statutory  circumstances  are  not 
established and the sentencing court orders restitution, the challenge 
to  the  sentence  implicates  its  legality.  In  either  of  these  sentencing 
scenarios,  a  challenge  to  the  sentence  of  restitution  need  not  be 
preserved.

Commonwealth v. Weir

As  to  a  challenge  to  the  discretionary  aspects  of  a  sentence  which  includes  a 

 
restitution order, the Supreme Court stated:

Moreover,  the  discretionary  nature  of  the  amount  of  restitution 
is  established  in  Section  1106(c)(2),  which  sets  forth  the  factors 
to  be  considered  by  the  sentencing  court  in  fashioning  an  award  of

to limit the order of restitution because the victim had signed a general release in favor of the defendant as a result of civil settlement 
which was paid by the defendant’s insurer.  The Superior Court found:

In the present case, the sentencing judge refused to consider restitution (beyond the aforesaid $900.00) because 
the victim had signed a general civil release, having obtained a settlement from Appellee which was paid by his 
insurer. The court reasoned that the release precluded its consideration of restitution. We find this determination 
to be legal error. The victim could no more release Appellee from a potential sentence of restitution than from a 
potential sentence of incarceration or probation. All such matters are within the sentencing court’s authority and 
duty. It was not for the victim to circumscribe the criminal court’s powers or obligations.

by the victim, the victim’s request for restitution as presented to the 
district attorney ... and such other matters as it deems appropriate.” 
18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(2)(i). This language, placing the determination of 
the amount of restitution under the sentencing court’s consideration 
based on the stated factors and “other matters it deems appropriate,” is 
the clearest possible indication of the General Assembly’s recognition 
that fashioning the restitution order remained in the exercise of the 
sentencing  court’s  discretion.  [An  appellant’s]  discontent  with  the 
amount  of  restitution  and  the  evidence  supporting  it  is  a  challenge 
to the sentencing court’s exercise of discretion, not to the legality of 
the sentence. To access review of his challenge by the Superior Court, 
[an appellant is] required to file a Pa.R.A.P 2119(f) statement in his 
appellate brief.

Authority  Appeal  from  Restitution  Order

  –  challenge  directed  to  the  trial  court’s 
statutory authority to impose restitution, - considered a challenge to the legality of the 
sentence.
Discretionary Appeal from Restitution Order

 – challenge directed at the amount of 
the restitution order under the circumstances presented to the trial court - considered a 
challenge to the discretionary aspects of the sentence.

  Where the court’s authority to impose restitution is challenged, such as on the basis 
that the trial court’s order of restitution is to a person who is not considered a “victim” 
of the crime as defined in the Crimes Code under Section 1106(h), it is a challenge which 
Commonwealth v. Langston
implicates  the  legality  of  the  restitution  sentence  and  is  consequently  non-waivable.  
, 904 A.2d 917, 921 (Pa. Super. 2006).  “Restitution” and 

“Victim” are defined in 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106 as:

(h)  Definitions.--As  used  in  this  section,  the  following  words  and 
phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subsection:

“Restitution.” The return of the property of the victim or payments in 
cash or the equivalent thereof pursuant to an order of the court.

“Victim.” As defined in section 103 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L. 
882, No. 111), known as the Crime Victims Act.1 The term includes an 
affected government agency, the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund, 
if  compensation  has  been  paid  by  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation 
Fund to the victim, any insurance company that has compensated the 
victim for loss under an insurance contract and any business entity.

Commonwealth 
A challenge to the amount of restitution under the circumstances presented to the 

 
v. Walker
trial court is a challenge to the discretionary aspects of sentence. See 

, 666 A.2d 301, 307 (Pa. Super. 1995) (stating that challenges alleging that a 
sentence of restitution is excessive under the circumstances of the case are challenges to 
the discretionary aspects of sentencing). 

In  the  Interest  of  M.W.

In  an  earlier  decision, 

 
,  725  A.2d  729  (Pa.  1999),  the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court addressed the confusion surrounding whether an appeal 
challenges the discretionary aspects of sentencing rather than the legality, and clarified 
that a claim that the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose restitution implicates 
the legality of sentence, whereas a claim that the amount of restitution is excessive under 
the circumstances presented to the trial court implicates the discretionary aspects of 
sentencing. 

 at 731 n. 4. 

Id.

An  appellant  challenging  the  discretionary  aspects  of  his  sentence,  in  regard  to 
 
a  restitution  order,  must  comply  with  the  requirements  for  raising  a  challenge  to  the 
discretionary aspects of a sentence. 
 708 A.2d 1279, 1281 (Pa. 
Super. 1998). There is a four-part test:

Commonwealth v. Colon,

[W]e conduct a four-part analysis to determine: (1) whether appellant 
has  filed  a  timely  notice  of  appeal,  see  Pa.R.A.P.  902  and  903;  (2) 
whether the issue was properly preserved at sentencing or in a motion 
to reconsider and modify sentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P. [720]; (3) whether 
appellant’s brief has a fatal defect, Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether 
there is a substantial question that the sentence appealed from is not 
appropriate under the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(b).

Commonwealth v. Moury,

F.  The “Causal Connection” 

 992 A.2d 162, 170 (Pa. Super. 2010).

As a general rule, when restitution is imposed under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a) as a direct 
sentence, there must be a specific nexus between the amount of restitution ordered by a 
trial court and the crime committed. 

Case  law  speaks  of  restitution  imposed  under  §  1106(a)  as  being 
Interest  of  M.W.
a  direct  sentence,  rather  than  just  a  condition  of  probation  or

Commonwealth v. Harner,

, 919 A.2d 234, 237-238 (Pa. Super. 2007)(emphasis added).  
Similarly, in 
 617 A.2d 702 (Pa. 1992),  the Supreme Court 
noted  that  Section  1106  “applies  only  for  those  crimes  to  property  or  person  where 
there has been a loss that flows from the conduct which forms the basis of the crime for 
which a defendant is held criminally responsible.” 617 A.2d at 706.

Commonwealth v. Kinnan

However, when restitution is imposed as a condition of probation under 42 Pa.C.S.A. 
 
§ 9763, the required nexus between the defendant’s criminal conduct and the victim’s 
loss is relaxed.  
, 71 A.3d 983, 986 (Pa. Super. 2013) (decided 
under Section 9754).  

However,  when  restitution  is  ordered  as  a  condition  of  probation, 
the sentencing court is accorded the latitude to fashion probationary 
conditions designed to rehabilitate the defendant and provide some 
measure of redress to the victim.... Thus, the requirement of a nexus 
between  the  damage  and  the  offense  is  relaxed  where  restitution  is 
ordered as a condition of probation.

Commonwealth v. Hall

Commonwealth v. Kinnan

, 80 A.3d 1204, 1215 (Pa. 2013).  Even with this relaxed nexus, 
“there  must  be  at  least  an  indirect  connection  between  the  criminal  activity  and  the 
loss.”

IV.  TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS

 

 
In  October  2011,  the  Pennsylvania  Office  of  the  Victim  Advocate  convened  the 
Restitution in Pennsylvania Task Force.  The final report of the Task Force contained 47 
recommendations for the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government. A 
summary of the recommendations are grouped into four overarching categories.  Those 
recommendations which relate to trial courts are printed in bold lettering:

2.  Develop  restitution  bench  books  for  the  juvenile  justice  and 

Uniformity of Policy and Practice Recommendations: 
 
1.  Convene  a  group  of  stakeholders  to  further  review  existing 
restitution law and compile recommendations for judicial, legislative or 
department/agency clarifications or revisions. 
 
criminal justice systems.
 
3. Upon completion of the restitution bench books, develop quick 
reference sheets for restitution in the criminal and juvenile justice systems.
 
4. In conjunction with the development of restitution bench books, 
develop  educational  strategies,  training  and  technical  assistance  for 
bench, bar, victim services, police and probation. 
5. Develop a toolkit which would clarify policy and practice around 
 
restitution  issues,  identify  evidence  based  and/or  promising  practices, 
clarify available enforcement tools and provide helpful articles, brochures, 
etc. 
 

6.  Encourage  Administrative  Office  of  Pennsylvania  Courts  and/or 

21      Chapter 1      

Introduction

the Court Rules Committee to standardize a restitution order for use at 
sentencing/disposition. 
 
7.  Encourage  counties  to  establish  collections  enforcement  units 
and  hire  dedicated  staff  to  solely  focus  on  collections  enforcement 
efforts within the jurisdiction. 
8.  Encourage  President  Judges  to  establish  restitution,  fines  and 
 
costs contempt courts allocating the judicial resources to preside over 
such hearings. 
9. The General Assembly should consider amending Title 42 Section 
 
9728 (b)(5) to establish a mandated minimum percentage threshold for 
deductions from inmate personal accounts for both county correctional 
facilities and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. 
10.  Encourage  counties  to  provide  Pennsylvania  Department 
 
of  Transportation  with  non-payment  information  so  that  the  newly 
enacted mandate (Act 146 of 2012) for drivers’ license suspension can 
be utilized, as appropriate. 
 
11. Make wider use of dunning letters or overdue notices to notify 
or  remind  defendants  that  their  payments  are  past  due  and  of  the 
sanctions that may be imposed by the court if they do not come into 
payment plan compliance. 
 
both the criminal and juvenile justice systems. 
13.  Expand  the  availability  of  programs  and  processes  such  as  Victim 
Offender  Conferencing/Dialogue  throughout  both  the  criminal  and 
juvenile justice systems.

12. Develop restitution funds and restitution programs throughout 

Strengthening Accountability Recommendations: 
 
 
14.  Reinforce  the  mandate  that  all  Clerks  of  Court  comply  with 
Act  84  of  1998  and  transmit  “copies  of  all  orders  for  restitution  and 
amendments  or  alterations  thereto,  reparation,  fees,  costs,  fines  and 
penalties”  to  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Corrections  for  state 
sentenced  inmates  and  to  the  county  correctional  facility  for  county 
sentenced inmates. 
15. Reinforce the mandate that all Clerks of Court comply with the 
 
Act 84 of 1998 requirement to file civil judgments when a case balance 
reaches or exceeds $1,000 and to exercise the option to file below $1,000 
if effective in a particular case to enforce payment compliance. 
 
Pennsylvania. 
 
17.  Establish  performance  measures  for  agencies  supervising 
probationers  and  parolees  relative  to  the  payment/collection  of 
restitution. 
 
18.  Counties  should  conduct  annual  reviews  to  ensure  that 
restitution collections are not superseded by the collection of county-
assessed  prison  room  and  board  rates  and  other  county-established 

16.  Provide  support  for  on-going  research  regarding  restitution  in 

22      Chapter 1      

Introduction

fees and payment allocation priorities. 
19.  Strengthen  existing  tools  to  enhance  restitution  collection 
 
with  particular  attention  to  the  issue  of  collecting  restitution  from 
adjudicated delinquents between the ages of 18 and 21. 
 
20. Encourage the Juvenile Court Judges Commission to work with 
the Pennsylvania Council of Chief Juvenile Probation Officers to create or 
modify  existing  juvenile  justice  data  collection  and  reporting  processes 
to accurately and in detail track and publish county-specific information 
regarding the ordering and collection of restitution. 

24.  Establish  a  web-based  system  for  victims/survivors  to  update 

Coordination of Information Recommendations: 
 
 
21. Identify an overarching agency or organization to continue the 
efforts of the Restitution in Pennsylvania Task Force, such as Pennsylvania 
Commission  on  Crime  and  Delinquency,  Administrative  Office  of 
Pennsylvania Courts or the Office of the Victim Advocate.
22.  Establish  or  agree  to  a  unique  individual  identifier  to  be  used 
 
across executive agencies and the judicial branch to better match records 
pertaining  to  individuals  owing  restitution,  court  costs  and  fines  in  the 
commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  within  databases  i.e.,  Pennsylvania 
Department  of  Transportation,  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Public 
Welfare and Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts’ records. 
 
23. Develop the capacity for Administrative Office of Pennsylvania 
Courts, the courts, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Office of the 
Victim Advocate, Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and similar 
county-level  agencies  to  share  information  to  ascertain  a  defendant’s 
total fines, costs, and restitution payments owed across all cases. 
 
personal contact information related to their restitution order. 
 
25.  Encourage  all  counties  to  establish  communication  protocols 
to determine whether individuals are in payment plan compliance with 
respect to public assistance eligibility. 
26. Place defendants on a single electronic payment plan (including 
 
restitution owed on juvenile delinquency cases) in the Common Pleas 
Case Management System and/or the Magisterial District Judge System 
applications  maintained  by  the  Administrative  Office  of  Pennsylvania 
Courts for Courts of Common Pleas and Magisterial District Courts end 
users. 
 
27.  Enable  the  identification  and  collection  of  restitution  owed 
in delinquency cases from offenders under the jurisdiction of criminal 
courts,  adult  probation  departments,  Pennsylvania  Department  of 
Corrections and Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole. 
 
28.  Encourage  counties  to  enter  warrants  surrounding  the  issue 
of  failing  to  pay  restitution,  fines,  and  costs,  and/or  failure  to  appear 
for said proceedings into Commonwealth Law Enforcement Assistance 
Network/National  Crime  Information  Center,  as  appropriate.  Such 

23      Chapter 1      

Introduction

action will assist in the location of offenders outside of the originating 
jurisdiction and once located could result in the immediate collection of 
monies without the necessity to extradite/transport offenders.
 
29.  Clarify  accepted  documentation  and  practice  for  Pennsylvania 
Department of Corrections in order to maximize the collection of restitution 
from  inmates;  and  modify  required  forms  to  include  all  outstanding 
restitution, fines and costs owed by an individual upon commitment to 
the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. 
30. Attach priority to the collection of restitution, fines and costs 
 
in  the  development  of  the  Common  Pleas  Case  Management  System 
delinquency module. 
 
31. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania should consider providing 
a  capacity  to  address  collections  performance  measures  and  promote 
evidence-based and/or promising practices to improve the collection of 
restitution. 
32.  Pennsylvania  Commission  on  Crime  and  Delinquency,  through 
 
Criminal  Justice  Advisory  Boards,  should  conduct  training  and  share 
information  with  counties  and  prison  boards  on  the  evidence-based 
and  promising  practices  of  other  counties  that  improve  the  restitution 
processes, including collection methods, prison policies, costs, etc. 
 
33. Create or modify existing criminal justice data collection and 
reporting processes to accurately and in detail track and publish county-
specific information regarding the ordering and collection of restitution. 
34. Provide practical information about restitution to victims. 
 
35. Provide practical information about restitution to defendants. 
 

Expansion of Authority Recommendations: 
 
 
36. Maintain the current mandatory threshold of filing civil judgments 
as  per  Title  42  Section  9728  (b)(1)  when  “judgments  for  restitution, 
reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties which, in the aggregate, exceed 
$1,000.” 
 
37.  The  General  Assembly  should  consider  amending  Title  42 
Section 9728 (b)(5) to mandate both county correctional facilities and the 
Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to make deductions from inmate 
personal accounts. 
 
38. Expand Pennsylvania Department of Transportation’s authority 
to suspend and/or prohibit renewal of driver licenses for payment non-
compliance.  [It  is  noted  that  this  recommendation  was  accomplished 
through the passage of Act 146 of 2012.]
 
39.  The  General  Assembly  should  consider  amending  relevant 
statutes  to  authorize  counties  or  courts  to  suspend  or  prohibit  the 
issuance of state-issued licenses when the applicant is delinquent in the 
payment  of  restitution,  fines  or  costs.  Types  of  licenses,  registrations 
or  other  authorizations  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  driver’s  license; 
hunting; fishing; professional licenses; vehicle registrations; etc. License 

24      Chapter 1      

Introduction

limitations  or  suspensions  shall  be  based  on  an  individual  case  by  case 
determination. 
 
40.  The  General  Assembly  should  consider  amending  Title  42 
Section 9728 (g) Costs, etc., to clearly state that costs incurred by counties 
in  support  of  collections  enforcement  efforts  (staff,  overhead)  shall  be 
borne by defendants. 
 
41. The General Assembly should consider amending Title 42 Section 
9730 adding section (a. 1) to clarify the authority of the court to assign the 
wages of a defendant who agrees to an assignment of income of not more 
than 25% of the defendant’s gross salary, wages or other earnings to the 
court for payment of any restitution, fines or court cost. This amendment 
should also impose obligations on employers in this regard. 
42.  The  Criminal  Procedural  Rules  Committee  should  consider  re-
 
visiting  Pa.R.Crim.P.  535  and  recommend  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme 
Court adopt a revision authorizing the sentencing court to order any cash 
bail  money  posted  by  the  defendant  to  be  applied  to  any  restitution, 
court costs or fines imposed. Alternatively the General Assembly should 
consider  amending  Title  42  adding  a  Section  5703  to  provide  for  bail 
money posted by a defendant to be applied to restitution, fines and costs.
43.  The  General  Assembly  should  consider  authorizing  courts  to 
 
order wage attachment for defendants who have been found in contempt 
for nonpayment of restitution, costs or fines. 
44.  The  General  Assembly  should  consider  authorizing  courts 
 
to  order  wage  attachment  for  defendants  who  have  the  ability  to  pay 
restitution, costs or fines. 
 
45.  The  United  States  Congress  should  consider  amending  the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Section 6402 to require the IRS to pay any 
state judicial debt to include overdue costs, fines and/or restitution from 
any federal income tax refund due to a delinquent defendant. 
46.  The  General  Assembly  should  consider  enacting  or  amending 
 
statute  to  require  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Revenue  and 
Pennsylvania  Lottery  to  pay  any  state  judicial  debt  to  include  overdue 
restitution, costs and/or fines from any state income tax refunds and/or 
lottery winnings. 
 
47.  The  Criminal  Procedures  Rules  Committee  should  consider 
examining  current  court  rules  and  the  rules  of  other  jurisdictions  to 
consider whether any rules should be amended or new rules adopted to 
improve the collection of restitution.

  Section 9721 of the Sentencing Code, regarding sentencing generally, provides

§ 9721. Sentencing generally

(a) General rule.--In determining the sentence to be imposed the court 
shall, except as provided in subsection (a.1), consider and select one or 
more of the following alternatives, and may impose them consecutively 
or concurrently:

(1) An order of probation.
(2) A determination of guilt without further penalty.

2.  The Definition of a “Victim”

); 

 
Both  Section  9721(c)  and  Section  1106(a)  refer  to  a  “victim”,  but  defining  who
  qualifies as a “victim” for purposes of ordering mandatory restitution can be confusing
 due to incorporation by reference and legislative amendments.

Prior Version of 18 Pa.C.S.A. §1106

 
Section 9721(c) requires a court to order restitution to a victim for damage resulting 
from a defendant’s criminal conduct. The statute provides that “the term ‘victim’ shall be 
as defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 177, No. 175), known as The 
4      Chapter 2      

Mandatory Restitution at Sentencing

Administrative Code of 1929.” Section 479.1 however, was repealed by the act of May 15, 
1998 (P.L. 882, No. 111, § 5103), also known as the Crime Victims Act.

Prior  to  October  24,  2018,  section  1106(h)  also  defined  the  term  “victim”  as 
 
“defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 177, No. 175), known as The 
Administrative Code of 1929.”

Commonwealth v. Holmes
  The use of section 479.1 in the prior version of section 1106(h)  was discussed 
, 155 A.3d 69 (Pa. Super. 
by the Superior Court in 
2017) (
).  The Superior Court examined whether the parents of a child 
who was killed in a DUI fatality may be considered victims under 1106(a) for 
purposes  of  ordering  restitution  to  recover  the  costs  of  the  child’s  funeral 
expenses. Initially, to answer that question, the Court had to determine what 
definition of the term “victim” was applicable in light of the legislative repeal of 
section 479.1. After examining the subsequent history to section 479.1 and its 
repealer provisions, the opinion in support of affirmance (OISA) determined 
Id.
that the CVA was a codification of the repealed statute and that unless clearly 
 
different from current law, the CVA was a continuation of the prior law. 
at  80-81.    Under  these  legislative  directives,  the  OISA  concluded  that  the 
definition of “victim” under the repealed section 479.1 and the current CVA 
revealed that they were consistent with each other and therefore, the current 
definition of “victim” under the CVA is, as intended, a part of the definition of 
“victim” under section 1106(h).  

The opinion in support of reversal (OISR) disagreed, reasoning, that in light 
of  the  legislature’s  various  amendments  to  the  Crimes  Code  subsequent  to 
1998  when  section  479.1  was  repealed,  and  the  continued  inaction  by  the 
legislature  to  replace  section  479.1  with  the  CVA,  that  a  court  could  only 
order  restitution  to  a  “direct    victim”  under  section  1106(a).    According  to 
the OISR, this did not include the parents of a child victim.  It was the position 
of the OISA that prior cases failed to consider section 5103 of the CVA that 
deemed the CVA to be a continuation of the repealed provisions of the Crimes 
Code, and that in fact, the Supreme Court reserved resolution of the interplay 
between section 1106 and the CVA for purposes of defining “victims” under 
, 80 A.3d 1204 (Pa. 
those statutes.  
2013).  The OISA was the Superior Court’s attempt to resolve that interplay. 
 
The 2018 amendment to incorporate the definition of “victim” as contained 
under the CVA into section 1106(h) may be considered a legislative ratification 
of the OISA position in

Current Version of 18 Pa.C.S.A. §1106

“Victim” is now defined in section 1106(h) as:

As defined in section 103 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L. 882, 

5      Chapter 2      

Mandatory Restitution at Sentencing

Crime  Victims  Act

affected government agency, the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund, 
if  compensation  has  been  paid  by  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation 
Fund to the victim, any insurance company that has compensated the 
victim for loss under an insurance contract and any business entity.

18 Pa.C.S.A. §1106(h). (Emphasis added). 

et. seq

The  Crime  Victim’s  Act  (“CVA”),  18  P.S.  §  11.101, 

 
.,  provides  definitions  for 
both a “direct victim” and a “victim”.  Section 11.103 of the CVA defines a “Direct” victim 
as 

“Direct victim.” An individual against whom a crime has been committed 
or attempted and who as a direct result of the criminal act or attempt 
suffers physical or mental injury, death or the loss of earnings under 
this  act.  The  term  shall  not  include  the  alleged  offender.  The  term 
includes  a  resident  of  this  Commonwealth  against  whom  an  act  has 
been  committed  or  attempted  which  otherwise  would  constitute  a 
crime as defined in this act but for its occurrence in a location other 
than this Commonwealth and for which the individual would otherwise 
be  compensated  by  the  crime  victim  compensation  program  of  the 
location  where  the  act  occurred  but  for  the  ineligibility  of  such 
program  under  the  provisions  of  the  Victims  of  Crime  Act  of  1984 
(Public Law 98-473, 42 U.S.C. § 10601 

et seq.

).

 

The designation of a “Victim” includes the following terms:

“Victim.”

 The term means the following:

(1) A direct victim.

(2) A parent or legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim, except 
when the parent or legal guardian of the child is the alleged offender.

(3)  A  minor  child  who  is  a  material  witness  to  any  of  the  following 
crimes and offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to crimes and offenses) 
committed or attempted against a member of the child’s family:
Chapter 25 (relating to criminal homicide).
Section 2702 (relating to aggravated assault).
Section 3121 (relating to rape).

(4) A family member of a homicide victim, including stepbrothers or 
stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a fiance, one of whom is to be 
identified to receive communication as provided for in this act, except

  While  Section  9721

18  P.S.  §  11.103. 
  and  Section  1106  complement  each 
other   addressing   restitution   to   victims   of   crime,   two   distinctions   between   these 
statutes  are  notable.

 
First, while Section 9721 speaks in terms of a defendant compensating a “victim” for 
loss or injury resulting from a defendant’s criminal conduct, Section 1106 speaks in terms 
of  compensating  a  “victim”  who  suffers  loss  to  property  or  personal  injury  “directly” 
resulting from an offender’s crime.  To date, no appellate case has addressed whether 
the reference to victim under 9721 and the reference to a victim who directly suffers 
harm  under  Section  1106  are  in  conflict  where  both  statutes  provide  that  restitution
  is  mandatory.  Under  rules  of  statutory  construction,  these  two  provisions  should  be
  construed together in 
 as one statute, as they relate to the same thing, and
See
 in a manner where the more specific provision controls the general if the two provisions
 are irreconcilable.  
 1 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 1932, 1933. When viewed in this light, section 9721
 is the general rule and Section 1106 the more specific.  Therefore, it may be considered
 that under both statutes courts are obligated to order restitution to a victim who suffers
 property loss or personal harm as a direct result from an offender’s criminal action.

pari materia

Second, as currently written, Sections 9721 and 1106 do not share the same definition
 of a “victim”. 





  Section  9721  incorporates  the  definition  of  a  “victim”  by  reference  to 
Section  479.1  of  the  act  of  April  9,  1929  (P.L.  177,  No.  175),  known  as  The 
Administrative Code of 1929.  In contrast, section 1106(h) incorporates by 
reference the definition of a “victim” as contained in the Crime Victims Act.  
As explained above, this was not always the case.   It would seem however, 
that since Section 9721 presents the same repealer and amendment problem 
as that considered in 
, that the same result should be reached, that 
being, that the definition of “victim” under Section 9721 is as defined under
the CVA.   This should be especially so where the legislature acted to amend
the definition of “victim” to be as defined under the CVA.

Holmes

  At  sentencing,  when  a trial  court  must  consider ordering restitution  under 
Section 1106(a), it first must be careful to identify who qualifies as a “victim”, 
since  restitution  under  Section  1106(a)  only  may  be  paid  to  those  victims 
identified  as  such  under  that  statute.    The  incorporation  of  the  CVA  into 
the definition of “victim” under Section 1106(h) expands who qualifies as a 
Section 1106(a) victim who suffers a loss as a direct result of a defendant’s 
criminal conduct.  

1    42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9721. 
 

The interplay between the definitions of “victim” and “direct victim” is illustrated

child killed in a car accident as a result of the car owner being convicted of REAP for 
allowing the child to drive the owner’s car while drunk, could be awarded restitution for 
funeral expenses as a victim under Section 1106(a).   Following the definition of “victim” 
as defined under the CVA, the OISA found that the parents were entitled to be awarded 
restitution.  Incorporating the CVA’s definition of “victim” into Section 1106(a) qualified
 the  parents  as  Section  1106(a)  victims,  since  the  CVA’s  definition  of  “victim”  includes
  the parents of a child who was a direct victim of a crime.   Without this connection, 
 could  not  qualify  for  restitution  under  Section  1106(a).   The

may be imposed without regard to the defendant’s ability to pay. See 
18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(i)(court shall consider restitution regardless 
of  the  current  financial  situation  of  the  defendant).  However,  when

ordered,  the  amount  must  be  determined  at  the 
time  of  sentencing,  18  Pa.C.S.A.  §  1106(c)(2).  It  also

the defendant could afford to pay.  That is no longer a factor when restitution is mandatory at the time of sentencing because of the 
amendments to Section 1106(c) which establish that a defendant’s ability to pay is irrelevant except when the court imposes a payment 
plan or if the defendant defaults on the restitution order.  18 Pa.C.S.A.§ 1106(c)(1)(i).

As a result, Section 1106 requires the sentencing court to determine the specifics 
of restitution at the initial sentencing hearing.  If the sentencing court does not address 
the  specific  amount  of  restitution  and  a  payment  method,  or  if  the  sentencing  court 
refers these items to another agency of the court (such as the probation department), 
the sentencing order will be vacated:

Commonwealth  v.  Deshong

The record reflects that at the sentencing hearing, the court ordered 
Appellant  “to  pay  costs,  [and]  make  restitution,  which  is  capped 
at  $1,481,562.54.”  N.T.,  1/4/2006,  at  32.  While  the  court  did  set  a 
maximum  cap,  the  court  did  not  specify  any  particular  amount  of 
restitution, particularly as to future medical expenses. Moreover, the 
court did not specify any method of payment.

which the court attempted to clarify both the amount and the method 
of payment. N.T., 5/19/2006, at 4–5. Specifically, the court indicated its

is only so that if such costs are accrued, Defendant will be responsible 
for  their  payment.”)  Unfortunately,  the  court  never  modified  the 
sentencing order to make these facts clear. Rather, the certified record 
continues  to  reflect  only  a  generalized  order  of  restitution  with  no 
amount or method of payment. We are constrained to hold that such 
an order is illegal and must be corrected.

The  court  was  required  to  assess  the  loss  to  the  victim  and  order 
full  restitution  as  of  the  date  of  the  sentencing  hearing.  The  record 
establishes that as of that date, [the victim] owed the full amount of 
the medical bills to the hospital, and that none of the bills had been 
paid by any party. Accordingly, the restitution order properly provided 
for  full  payment  to  the  victim  who  at  the  time  of  sentencing  had  an 
outstanding  obligation  to  pay  the  full  amount  of  the  bills.  An  order 
requiring  [Appellant]  to  pay  “restitution”  to  the  hospital,  which  was 
very unlikely to ever be paid, would not extinguish [Appellant’s] legal 
obligation  to  pay  [the  victim’s]  hospital  bills.  Moreover,  there  is  no 
provision  in  the  restitution  statute  that  empowers  a  court  to  order 
that  restitution  be  paid  to  a  creditor  of  a  victim:  only  parties  who

C.  Priorities of Restitution Payments

 
Although Section 1106 of the Crimes Code provides for mandatory restitution, the 
sentencing court must set priorities of payment, in the event more than one victim is 
to  receive  restitution.  In  accordance  with  Section  1106(c)(1)(ii),  when  establishing 
priorities, the sentencing court must order payment in the following order:

•  Any individual victim.
•  Any  affected  government  agency,  defined  as  the  Commonwealth, 
a  political  subdivision  or  local  authority  that  has  sustained  injury  to 
property.

•  The Crime Victim’s Compensation Board.
•  Any other governmental agency which has provided reimbursement to 

the victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct.

•  For  example,  the  extent  that  restitution  is  ordered  either  prior  to  or 
subsequent to the making of an award by the Office of Victims’ Services, 
the restitution shall be paid to the Commonwealth to the extent of the 
award by the Office of Victims’ Services. 18 P.S. § 11.1302

•  Any  insurance  company  which  has  provided  reimbursement  to  the 
victim  as  a  result  of  the  defendant’s  criminal  conduct  –  insurance 
company defined as an entity that compensates a victim for loss under 
an insurance contract;

•  Any estate or testamentary trust; 
•  Any business entity organized as a nonprofit or not-for-profit entity;
•  Any other business entity. 

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(ii). A “business entity” is defined as a domestic or foreign:

(1) business corporation;
(2) nonprofit corporation;
(3) general partnership;
(4) limited partnership;

Commonwealth v. Keenan

 
It is important to note that although the listing of priorities in Section 1106(c)(1)

an estate or testamentary trust, none of these is included in the definition of “victim” in 
Section 1106(h). 

Commonwealth v. Brown

In 

, 981 A.2d 893 (Pa. 2009), the Pennsylvania Supreme 
 
Court  was  faced  with  a  similar  problem  when  they  reviewed  the  decision  of  the  trial 
court  which  had  granted  restitution  to  Medicare.    At  the  time,  Section  1106  did  not 
mention Medicare or any specific governmental entities, so that it was unclear whether 
Medicare, as a governmental agency, could receive restitution. The Supreme Court noted 
that the Legislature, by adopting Section 1106, made clear that it intended a variety of 
possible persons to be eligible to receive restitution by including a priority scheme when 
.  at  898. 
restitution  to  more  than  one  person  was  ordered  at  the  same  sentencing. 
“Thus,  while  the  General  Assembly  seemingly  envisions  certain  government  agencies 
to be entitled to restitution, which government agencies are to receive restitution is not 
plain.” 

Id.

Id

 
1995 and 1996

The Supreme Court recognized that the Legislature had rewritten Section 1106 in 

12

  in order to expand the class of entities eligible for restitution.  

While  not  the  model  of  clarity,  the  legislature  certainly  evinced  an 
extension of those entities who could receive restitution through the 
priorities scheme. As noted above, this included not only the “victim,” 
but  also  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation  Board,  other  government 
agencies,  and 
insurance  companies.  Furthermore,  the  General 
Assembly explicitly enlarged the definition of “victim” to include the 
Crime  Victim’s  Compensation  Fund  and  insurance  companies.  Thus, 
while  the  General  Assembly  expanded  the  definition  of  “victim,”  .  .  . 
and  in  doing  so  widened  the  definition  of  that  term,  the  revamping 
of  Section  1106  was  even  more  sweeping  and  implicitly  broadened 
the  class  of  entities  eligible  for  restitution  to  include  government 
agencies, in addition to manifesting a heightened focus on the need for 
and importance of restitution.

Brown

,  981  A.2d  at  899–900.    The  Supreme  Court  then  looked  to  the  legislative 
history of Section 1106, the object to be obtained, and the consequences of particular 
interpretations. After a review of these standards, the Supreme Court concluded:

12  Of course, this would occur again in 2004 and 2018. 

[T]he legislature intended that a criminal offender not only be required 

18      Chapter 2      

Mandatory Restitution at Sentencing

to provide restitution to the victim directly, but to government agencies 
which  indirectly  provide  reimbursement  to  the  victim,  including 
payment to a medical provider on the victim’s behalf. As Medicare, a 
government agency, made payments to a medical provider on behalf of 
the victim as a direct result of Brown’s crime, we find that it is entitled 
to reimbursement under Section 1106.

A.2d 617 (Pa. 1995). In 
, a victim, who was a welfare recipient, was assaulted 
and  hospitalized  for  her  injuries.  The  Department  of  Public  Welfare  paid  the  victim’s 
medical costs and filed for restitution.  The Supreme Court opined that the prior version 
of Section 1106 failed to indicate whether government agencies were considered to be 
within the definition of “victim,” which was defined, at the time, as any “person” who 
suffered injuries as a direct result of the crime. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(h).  Therefore, the 
Court  turned  to  the  Statutory  Construction  Act’s  definition  of  “person.”  1  Pa.C.S.A.  § 
1991. The Court reasoned that, based upon the statutory definition of that term, which 
excluded from the definition of “person” governmental agencies of the Commonwealth, 
government agencies did not fall within the definition of “victim,” and, therefore, were

A number of statutory provisions define the term “victim”:
1. The Crimes Code

The  propriety  of  ordering  restitution  to  a  victim  is  delineated  in  the  Crimes 
victim
Code, in Chapter 11, Authorized Disposition of Offenders, which provides that upon 
conviction for any crime wherein the 
 suffered personal injury, “the offender 
shall  be  sentenced  to  make  restitution  in  addition  to  the  punishment  proscribed 
therefore.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a).  The term “victim” is defined under this section 
as follows:

“Victim.”

 As defined in section 103 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L. 
882, No. 111), known as the Crime Victims Act. The term includes an 
affected government agency, the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund, 
if  compensation  has  been  paid  by  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation 
Fund to the victim, any insurance company that has compensated the 
victim for loss under an insurance contract and any business entity.

 
 2. The Crime Victims Act

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(h).  The Crime Victims Act is codified at 18 P.S. § 11.103. 

The Crime Victims Act, 18 P.S. §§ 11.101 – 11.5102, defines a victim as:

“Victim.” The term means the following:

(1)  A direct victim.

(2)  A parent or legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim, except 
when  the  parent  or  legal  guardian  of  the  child  is  the  alleged 
offender.

(3)  A minor child who is a material witness to any of the following 
crimes  and  offenses  under  18  Pa.C.S.  (relating  to  crimes  and 
offenses) committed or attempted against a member of the child’s 
family:

Because  the  language  of  Section  1106  clearly  evidences  the  intent  to  provide 
the  victim  with  fullest  compensation  for  his  losses  suffered  as  a  direct  result  of  the 
defendant’s  criminal  conduct,  the  Superior  Court  found  justification  for  a  restitution 
order for lost wages in 
, 58 A.3d 790 (Pa. Super. 2012).  The 
Court looked to the statute’s explicit permission for an insurance company or employer 
(who  provides  an  employee’s  insurance  benefits)  to  be  reimbursed  by  the  defendant 
when  the  victim’s  lost  wages  were  covered  by  an  insurance  or  employment  contract.

of victim stood in the shoes of victim under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c), and therefore it was 
proper to award restitution for the amounts owed by the estate as reimbursement to 
the Department of Public Welfare.  The Department was a “victim” within meaning of

“Victim.”

 As defined in section 103 of the act of November 24, 1998 (P.L. 
1
882, No. 111), known as the Crime Victims Act.
 The term includes an 
affected government agency, the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund, 
if  compensation  has  been  paid  by  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation 
Fund to the victim, any insurance company that has compensated the 
victim for loss under an insurance contract and any business entity.

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(h). 

 
It is clear that the Crime Victim’s Compensation Board is an appropriate recipient 
Commonwealth  v.  Langston
of mandatory restitution for amounts it has advanced to crime victims in Pennsylvania.  
,  904  A.2d  917  (Pa.  Super.  2006).    However,  the  statute 
Id. 
requires that “a victim’s loss be caused directly by a defendant’s criminal conduct rather

Victim Of The Criminal Conduct

than a loss consequential to such conduct.” 
at 923. The mandatory payment of restitution 
pursuant to Section 1106 of the Crimes Code 
is limited to victims who suffer a direct loss and not to third parties, including family 
members, who shoulder the burden of the victim’s losses.

 

Payments to Family Members

Commonwealth  v.  Langston

In 

 
,  904  A.2d  917  (Pa.  Super.  2006),  restitution  was 
ordered to be paid to the Crime Victims Compensation Fund for monies it paid on behalf 
of  Michael  Clark,  who  was  in  utero  at  the  time  of  the  underlying  car  accident  which 
formed  the  basis  for  the  criminal  charges.  There  was  no  evidence  presented  that  he 
suffered any physical injuries as a result of defendant’s conduct. Michael Clark’s loss of 
support resulting from the death of his father, Glenn Clark, and the injuries to his mother, 
Annette Clark, caused during the car accident, while tragic, was an indirect consequence 
of defendant’s criminal conduct.

Langston

The  Court  in 

 
  held  that  it  was  not  disputed  that  Michael  was  a  victim/
claimant for purposes of the Crime Victims Act (CVA).  However, a “claimant” for purposes 
of  the  CVA  is  not  necessarily  a  “victim”  entitled  to  mandatory  restitution  under  18 
Pa.C.S.A. § 1106.  The defendant could only have been required to reimburse the Fund 
under  Section  1106(c)(1)(i)  for  compensation  paid  to  the  direct  victims,  Glenn  Clark 
and Annette Clark, Michael’s parents. Here, the Fund did not make any payments to  the
  direct   victims   of   defendant’s   crimes.   Restitution   is   not   a   replacement   for   child 
support unless the recipient is a direct victim of the crime.

holding  that  a  government  agency,  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Community  and 
Economic Development, was “neither a ‘direct victim’ nor a reimbursable compensating 
government  agency  under  Section  1106.” 
, 150 A.3d at  455  (footnote  omitted). 
Importantly,   the  Supreme  Court  scrutinized  the  language  in  Section  11.103  and 
determined that it applied to human beings only:

Veon

Veon

i.e

Notwithstanding any legislative expansion of the definition of “victim,” 
it is clear that the plain text of Section 11.103 still envisages “victims” 
as “persons” commonly understood. A “victim” under Section 11.103 
must be “a direct victim,” 
., an “individual” who has suffered injury, 
death, or loss of earnings; or a “child,” “parent,” “guardian,” or “family 
member.”  Every  relevant  noun  unequivocally  describes  a  human

definition that persuades us to broaden the common understanding

as an individual who has been harmed by the offender” and noting that 
“a government agency is not entitled to restitution because it is [not] 
an individual victim ....”). Further, we are bound by the 
 Court’s 
holding that the CVA precludes using the now-repealed definition of 
“victim” set forth in the Administrative Code of 1929 or the definition 
of  “person”  in  1  Pa.C.S.  §  1991  to  interpret  the  meaning  of  “victim” 
under the restitution statute. See

that the CVA’s definition of ‘victim’ “is the sole definition” for purposes 
of  Section  1106); 
  18  Pa.C.S.  §  1106(h);  18  P.S.  §  11.103. 
Therefore, based on our governing case law, because the USCG cannot 
be classified as a ‘direct victim’ under the CVA, the restitution portion 
of Appellant’s sentence is illegal and must be vacated. See

Restitution for Compensation Paid to Victim under Section 1106

 
The  1998  amendments  to  the  definition  of  a  “victim”  under  the  Crimes  Code 
broadened  the  class  of  those  entities  eligible  to  receive  restitution.    “Mandatory 
restitution” under Section 1106(c) requires the trial court to order full restitution:

(i) Regardless of the current financial resources of the defendant, so 
as  to  provide  the  victim  with  the  fullest  compensation  for  the  loss. 
The court shall not reduce a restitution award by any amount that the 
other government agency but shall order the defendant to pay any 
victim has received from the Crime Victim’s Compensation Board or 
restitution ordered for loss previously compensated by the board 
to  the  Crime  Victim’s  Compensation  Fund  or  other  designated 
account when the claim involves a government agency in addition 
to or in place of the board.

  Medicare

Commonwealth v. Brown
In light of the statutory amendments enacted in 1998, the Supreme Court in 
, 981 A.2d 893 (Pa. 2009), upheld a sentencing court’s 
order of restitution to Medicare for expenses it paid to medical providers on 
behalf of an assault victim who suffered injuries at the hands of the defendant. 
981 A.2d at 902. The defendant had argued that Medicare did not pay the victim 
directly, but paid the victim’s medical providers, and therefore Medicare had 
not provided “reimbursement” to the victim. 

Commonwealth  v.  Brown

,  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  decided  that 
In 
Medicare  was  entitled  to  restitution  for  payments  made  in  reference  to  the 
victim  of  the  defendant’s  criminal  conduct  and  for  the  treatment  of  injuries 
from defendant’s assault.  The Court stated:

[I]nterpreting Section 1106 to embrace those government entities 
that indirectly provide reimbursement to a victim would serve the 
salutary  purposes  of  making  manifest  to  criminal  offenders  the 
egregious nature of their actions, impressing upon defendants that 
they are responsible for their conduct, deterring repeat malfeasance, 
and  encouraging  these  individuals  to  live  in  a  responsible  way. 
Furthermore, we do not believe that such an interpretation would 
Commonwealth v. Figueroa
result in the adverse consequences suggested by [the defendant] 
and posited by the Superior Court in [
, 
such  an  interpretation 
691 A.2d 487 (Pa. Super. 1997)], where restitution is transformed

  Public Assistance Fraud

In  Pennsylvania,  it  is  a  crime  for  any  person  to  willfully  obtain

misrepresentation, impersonation, or other fraudulent means. 

Restitution to the government is mandatory:

  Benefits for Injured Police Officer
Commonwealth  v.  Smith

,  699  A.2d  1303  (Pa.  Super.  1997),  the  Superior 
In 
Court was faced with deciding whether the City of Allentown was entitled to 
restitution for having paid the police officer victim’s medical bills, indemnified 
 court 
his wages, and absorbed the cost of his portable police radio.  The 
discussed the 1995 amendments to the restitution statute which were intended 
to reimburse governmental agencies and insurance companies that had paid 
victims  for  losses  that  were  a  direct  result  of  a  defendant’s  criminal  actions.  
Specifically,  the 
  Court  relied  upon  the  dual  purpose  of  mandatory 
restitution: 

Smith

Smith

(1)  to  provide  the  victim  with  the  fullest  compensation 

for the loss, and 

(2)  to  rehabilitate  the  offender  by  impressing  upon  him 
that  his  criminal  conduct  caused  the  victim’s  loss 
or  personal  injury  and  that  it  is  his  responsibility  to 
repair the loss or injury as far as possible.  

In keeping with the purposes behind restitution, the Court held that the City 
was,  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  the  victim’s  insurer,  although  it  was  self-
insured, and that it was entitled to be reimbursed for the amounts it paid to the 
victim to compensate him for his wage loss.

defendant  had  pled  guilty  to  four  counts  of  Delivery  of  a  Controlled 
Substance.  The  Commonwealth  spent  $3,240  for  the  purchase  of 
controlled  substances  from  defendant.  Defendant  argued  that  his 
trial  counsel  should  have  objected  to  the  restitution  because  the 
Commonwealth  failed  to  prove  that  it  was  a  “victim”  within  the 
meaning  of  the  restitution  statute.  Because  the  Commonwealth  had 

31      Chapter 2

not reimbursed the victim, directly or indirectly, for property damage 
or  personal  injury,  the  Commonwealth  did  not  fall  under  section

4.  Payments by Insurance Companies

901 A.2d at 1033.

Reimbursement Of Insurance Proceeds Paid To Victim For Defendant’s Conduct

See 
An insurance company is only entitled to restitution if it is a victim as defined 

by Section 11.103, or it has compensated a victim for loss under Section 1106. 
18 P.S. § 11.103; 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(ii)(D). The Crime Victims Act, 18 P.S. § 
11.103, defines “victim” as:

(1) A direct victim
(2) A parent of legal guardian of a child who is a direct victim, except 
when the parent or legal guardian of the child is the alleged offender.
(3)  A  minor  child  who  is  a  material  witness  to  any  of  the  following 
crimes and offenses under 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to crimes and offenses) 
committed or attempted against a member of the child’s family...
(4) A family member of a homicide victim, including stepbrothers or 
stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a fiance, one of whom is to be 
identified to receive communication as provided for in this act, except 
where the family member is the alleged offender.

18 P.S. § 11.103 (1)-(4). “Direct victim” is defined in Section 11.103, in pertinent 
part, as:

individual

An 
 against whom a crime has been committed or attempted 
and who as a direct result of the criminal act or attempt suffers physical 
or mental injury, death or the loss of earnings under this act. The term 

32      Chapter 2      

Mandatory Restitution at Sentencing

shall not include the alleged offender.

Id. 

(emphasis added). Therefore, it would not appear that an insurance company 

could be considered a victim under the Crime Victims Act. 

  However,  under  18  Pa.C.S.A.  §  1106,  the  definition  of  “victim”  includes  an 
insurance  company  which  has  provided  reimbursement  to  a  victim  due  the 
defendant’s  criminal  conduct.  18  Pa.C.S.A.  §§  1106(c)(1)(i)  &(c)(1)(ii)(D).  
Insurance companies are listed in the priorities of payments in § 1106(h). 

[R]estitution for amounts paid by an insurer must be awarded to that 
insurer. The argument that an insurer cannot be considered a victim 
is  clearly  refuted  by  the  definition  of  “victim”  contained  within  the 
statute.  The  term  “Victim”  “includes  ...  any  insurance  company  that 
has compensated the victim for loss under an insurance contract.” 18 
Pa.C.S. § 1106(h). 

Commonwealth v. Stradley

, 50 A.3d 769, 773 (Pa. Super. 2012). 

Therefore, an insurance company that provides payment to a victim of a crime 

is considered a victim itself and entitled to mandatory restitution. 

The term “victim” includes any insurance company that has compensated the 
, 780 

victim for loss under an insurance contract. 
A.2d 714, 720 (Pa. Super. 2001).

Commonwealth v.  Opperman

Furthermore,  the  defendant  does  not  avoid  a  restitution  order  because  the 
victim has already received insurance proceeds which cover the damage caused 
by the defendant’s criminal conduct. Rather, under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(i), the 
sentencing court should not subtract from its restitution order any sums already 
received by the victim from insurance proceeds, but instead order the defendant 
to pay restitution to an insurance company for loss previously compensated.

Thus,  in  no  uncertain  terms,  the  statutory  language  requires  the 
sentencing court to order restitution so as to provide the victim with 
full compensation for his or her actual loss and that such an award is 
not to be reduced by any amount the victim received from an insurer.

Stradley,

 50 A.3d at 773. 

Victim’s Settlement with Insurance Company Irrelevant

Any release signed due to settlements in civil cases against the defendant, with 
reference to the defendant’s criminal conduct, do not serve to offset mandatory 
restitution.  The release is irrelevant to the sentencing court’s obligation to order

accident, Guerra had ingested large amounts of cocaine and alcohol. The victim’s 
parents  instituted  a  civil  suit  against  Guerra,  which  was  settled  by  Guerra  for 
amounts paid by AAA–Mid–Atlantic Insurance Group, Guerra’s insurer.  Guerra 
argued that he was entitled to a credit for the amounts paid by his insurer. The 
Court held that there is no entitlement to credit against a restitution obligation 
based upon civil settlement payment made by (or paid on behalf of) a defendant 
to victim’s family.  “The fact that a civil settlement agreement was reached by the

Although Section 1106(c)(3) allows the judge to alter restitution, this 
does  not  mean  that  in  every  case  the  judge  can  alter  the  restitution 
award at any time for any reason. There must be justifiable reasons 
for the modification, and other principles of law must be followed. At

A.  Best Practices: Advise Defendant at Time of Guilty Plea or Nolo Contendere Plea

854 A.2d at 1282

JUDICIAL POLICY:  Limited Rights to 
 
Appeal After Guilty Plea

 
Although  not  required  by  statute  or  under  the  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure,  in 
appropriate cases it is best to advise the defendant at the time of a plea of the trial court’s 
mandatory obligation to order restitution at sentencing and of the defendant’s right to 
a hearing on the appropriateness and amount 
of restitution.  By advising the defendant of the 
mandatory nature of restitution at sentencing, 
the trial court can ensure that the defendant is knowingly and voluntarily agreeing to 
the plea.  

JUDICIAL POLICY:  Notice to 
 
Defendant of Plea Premised Upon 
Specific Amount of Restitution

 
If the plea is premised upon the trial court imposing a specific amount of restitution 
upon acceptance of the plea, it is best for the trial court to provide the defendant with 
notice,  both  oral  and  written,  of  the  restitution  provision  prior  to  accepting  the  plea. 
 
  909  A.2d  805  (Pa.

Use of a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report

 

JUDICIAL POLICY:  Pre-sentence 
 
Reports May Be Utilized To

Pa.R.Crim.P.  702  provides  that  a  pre-sentence  investigation  report  “shall  include 
a  victim  impact  statement  as  provided  by  law.” 
Pa.R.Crim.P.  702(A)(4).  Although  a  defendant 
has a right to a hearing on restitution, that right 
can be waived when the defendant stipulates to 
the amount of restitution and raises no objection to the restitution order at the time of 
sentencing.

The presentence report contained copies of the billing invoices for the medical, 
hospital and emergency services provided to the victim for the injuries directly 
attributable  to  the  defendant’s  conduct.    The  trial  court  ruled  that  because 
the victim impact statement was made part of the record, was provided to the 
defendant, and the information contained therein was subject to reasonableness

JUDICIAL POLICY:  Restitution Not 
 
Dischargeable in Bankruptcy Chapter 7

by Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that mandatory 
restitution  in  the  amount  of  $6,700  as  part 
of a sentence for theft by deception, arising 
out of the victims’ advance payments to the 
defendant for remodeling work that he never performed, together with the defendant’s 
failure  to  refund  money,  was  exempt  from  discharge  in  Chapter  7.    The  Court  ruled 
that  the  restitution  order  was  not  dischargeable  regardless  of  whether  the  criminal

had failed to object to the discharge order in the bankruptcy proceedings.

Kelly  v.  Robinson

Upon examination of the facts of this case, in light of the relevant law, we 
hold that an order of restitution, payable pursuant to the Pennsylvania 
Crimes Code, is not subject to discharge under the Bankruptcy Code. 
.  We  further 
See  11  U.S.C.A.  §  523(a)(7); 
hold that an order of restitution entered subsequent to a bankruptcy 
discharge  is  separate  and  distinct  from  any  discharge  involving  a 
civil debt. Here, the trial court’s order of restitution arose out of the 
traditional responsibility of the Commonwealth to protect its citizens 
by  enforcing  its  criminal  statutes  and  to  rehabilitate  offenders  by 
imposing a criminal sanction intended for that purpose. See 
. Neither 
the Bankruptcy Code nor Pennsylvania law will allow appellant to avoid 
the  consequences  of  his  criminal  scheme,  as  the  decision  to  impose 
restitution turns on the penal goals of the State and the situation of the 
offender. A condition of restitution in a criminal sentence simply does 
not recreate the civil debtor-creditor relationship that existed in the 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
 Accordingly, we will not disturb the trial 
court’s restitution order.

Because, as all parties agree, the Commonwealth did not recommend

award at the sentencing hearing, and there is no support in the record

  Furthermore, the trial court must enter a definite amount of restitution, and a

The Superior Court has stated that as long as the sentencing court sets “some” type 
of restitution at the initial sentencing, meaning an amount and method of payment, in 
accordance with Rule 704, then the court retains the authority to modify restitution at a 
later date if necessary under the circumstances.

(2)  the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (“MVRA”), largely codified at 18

(3)  the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), largely codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771.

  Under the MVRA, the burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained 
by  a  victim  as  a  result  of  the  offense  is  on  the  attorney  for  the  Government  by  a

prove the amount of restitution:

proving the amount of the loss by a preponderance of the evidence. 
Moreover,  the  defendant  must  have  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  and 
to  cross-examine  witnesses.  The  defendant  is  entitled  to  rebut  the

United States v. Milkiewicz

People v. Mercer,

Restitution is, at its essence, a restorative remedy that compensates 
victims  for  economic  losses  suffered  as  a  result  of  a  defendant’s 
criminal conduct. In this sense, even though restitution is a criminal 
punishment,  it  does  not  transform  a  defendant’s  punishment  into 
something more severe than that authorized by pleading to, or being 
convicted of, the crime charged.

Rather,  restitution  constitutes  a  return  to  the  status  quo,  a  fiscal 
realignment whereby a criminal’s ill-gotten gains are returned to their 
rightful owner. In these circumstances, we do not believe that ordering 
a convicted defendant to return ill-gotten gains should be construed

,  911  A.2d  169  (Pa.  Super.  2006),  the  defendant  was 
 
convicted of simple assault and recklessly endangering another person after he battered 
the  victim,  leaving  the  victim  unconscious.  Immediately  after  the  assault,  the  victim 
required  surgery  because  he  had  fluid  in 
his  brain.    As  a  result,  the  victim  suffered 
an  organic  brain  syndrome  due  to  head 
trauma; he needs to reside at a nursing home 
indefinitely  because  he  is  unable  to  bathe,  dress,  or  care  to  this  personal  needs.  The 
sentencing court ordered restitution in the amount of $1,229,229.09, based upon the 
evidence of the victim’s continued medical and care needs presented at the sentencing 
hearing.  Although it will take the defendant a lifetime to pay the restitution, the Superior 
Court affirmed:   

While we do not doubt defendant’s assertion that he may be making 
restitution payments for the balance of his lifetime since he currently 
earns  only  $2,500.00  per  month  as  a  machine  operator,  we  will  not 
make  the  sweeping  pronouncement  he  seeks.  We  hold  that  the  trial 
court’s imposition of restitution does not constitute per se cruel and 
unusual punishment simply because it may take defendant a lifetime 
to pay. We conclude the trial court properly exercised its authority and 
did not impose restitution which was disproportionate to the injuries 
caused by defendant.

 Method and Payment of Restitution

Both the Crimes Code and the Sentencing Code address the amount and method of 
 
payment of restitution. Section 1106 of the Crimes Code refers only to restitution. The

In  most  cases,  the  court  will  need  to  create  a  payment  plan  for  the  collection  of 

 
restitution. 

  When restitution is imposed as a direct sentence, the court must adopt a method of 
payment on a schedule that the defendant can afford to pay because a defendant cannot 
be incarcerated for the failure to pay restitution if the failure results from the offender’s 
inability to pay:

55      Chapter 2

1106(f) provides

(f) 

 

  Noncompliance  with  restitution  order.

--Whenever  the 
offender  shall  fail  to  make  restitution  as  provided  in  the  order  of  a 
judge, the probation section or other agent designated by the county 
commissioners of the county with the approval of the president judge 
to collect restitution shall notify the court within 20 days of such failure. 
Whenever the offender shall fail to make restitution within 20 days to 
a magisterial district judge, as ordered, the magisterial district judge 
shall  declare  the  offender  in  contempt  and  forward  the  case  to  the 
court of common pleas. Upon such notice of failure to make restitution, 
or upon receipt of the contempt decision from a magisterial district 
judge, the court shall order a hearing to determine if the offender is in 
contempt of court or has violated his probation or parole.

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(f).  This provision addresses noncompliance with restitution orders 
before both a magisterial district court and a common pleas court.   

 

Default from MDJ Order of Restitution

  While cases involving restitution before magisterial district judges (“MDJ”) are rare, 
MDJs have jurisdiction to enter orders in cases involving summary offenses or certain 
misdemeanors of the third-degree where the amount of restitution is less than $500.  
42 Pa.C.S.A. § 1515(a)(1) and 6(i). However, Section 1106 applies only to “crimes,” not 
  Thus, courts of 
summary offenses, which are treated differently in the Crimes Code.
common pleas only pursue the nonpayment of restitution arising from cases where the 
MDJ sentenced a defendant in a third-degree misdemeanor. 

27

Restitution in summary offenses is governed by a combination of Pa.R.Crim.P. 456 
 
and 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9730. In short, Rule 456 sets forth the basic procedural requirements 
that  govern  contempt  proceedings  for  nonpayment  of  fines,  costs,  and  restitution. 
Because  the  relevant  statutory  and  constitutional  provisions  are  the  same  as  for 
contempt proceedings involving court of common pleas proceedings, they are discussed 
at length below. 

 

Default from Trial Court Order of Restitution

  When a common pleas court receives notice from a probation office that an offender 
has failed to make restitution, Section 1106(f) requires that the court order a hearing 
to determine if the defendant “is in contempt of court or has violated his probation or 
parole.” Such a proceeding is governed by both statutory and constitutional requirements. 
Section 9730(b) of the Sentencing Code, as amended in December 2019, provides the 
27  18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(a) specifies that it applies only “upon conviction for any crime.” The definitions in 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 106(c), in turn,

explain that “summary offenses” are not “crimes.”

the issuing authority, senior judge or senior magisterial district judge 
that default is imminent, the issuing authority, senior judge or senior 
magisterial  district  judge  may  schedule  a  rehearing  on  the  payment 
schedule.  At  the  rehearing  the  defendant  has  the  burden  of  proving 
changes of financial condition such that the defendant is without the 
means  to  meet  the  payment  schedule.  The  issuing  authority,  senior 
judge  or  senior  magisterial  district  judge  may  extend  or  accelerate

of community service as the issuing authority, senior judge or senior

In short, the court must hold a hearing, and it must do so each time the defendant 

 
appears before it for nonpayment:
57      Chapter 2      

Mandatory Restitution at Sentencing

Judges  must  hold  separate  hearings  for  each  alleged  contemnor  to 
ascertain  whether  any  noncompliance  flowed  from  (a)  deliberate 
disregard  of  the  court’s  order  or  (b)  circumstances  beyond  the 
defendant’s control. This must be done every time someone appears 
or  reappears  for  a  costs-and-fines  proceeding,  because  the  person’s 
financial situations may have changed since the last time she or he was 
before the court.
Commonwealth v. Mauk,

 

 185 A.3d 406, 411 (Pa. Super. 2018).

As stated above, if the court determines that the defendant is able to pay, then the 
 
court may enter an order for wage attachment, turn the delinquent account over to a 
private  collection  agency,  or  impose  imprisonment  for  nonpayment  “as  provided  by 
law.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9730(b)(2). 

The hearing contemplated under Section 9730(b) may be conducted by the court, or by 
a senior judge or senior magisterial district judge appointed by the president judge of 
the court.  In many respects the sanctions or remedies available to a court are similar to 
those that may be considered by an issuing authority under Rule 456.



If the court determines that the defendant is financially able to pay the restitution, 
the court may enter an order for wage attachment, turn the delinquent account over 
to a private collection agency or impose imprisonment for nonpayment, as provided 
by law.  

If the court determines a defendant is without the financial means to pay restitution 
immediately  or  in  a  single  remittance,  the  court  may  provide  for  payment  in 
installments with due consideration for a defendant’s ability to make payments and 
the burden payments may impose on the defendant.  

  Where a defendant is in default of a payment or advises that default is imminent, 
the  court  may  schedule  a  rehearing  on  the  payment  schedule,  at  which  time  the 
defendant  has  the  burden  of  proving  changes  of  financial  condition  such  that  he 
is without the means to meet the payment schedule.  If the defendant satisfies the 
burden  of  proof,  then  the  court  may  extend  or  accelerate  the  schedule,  leave  it 
unaltered, or sentence the defendant to a period of community service as is just and 
practical under the circumstances.

  While a court is not mandated to order imprisonment for failure to pay restitution 
when it is determined that a defendant is financially able to pay, it also is the case that a 
Commonwealth 
court may not imprison a person for nonpayment without a public hearing as required 
v. Smetana
under Section 9730(b)(1).

Contempt Proceedings

Contempt proceedings may be either civil or criminal in nature, and the court should 

 
determine at the start which method it is using. 

•  Civil  Contempt:  If  the  court  will  issue  an  order  designed  to  compel  payment, 
  Bruzzi  v. 
and  the  court  sets  certain  conditions  by  which  the  defendant  can  “purge”  the 
Bruzzi
contempt  and  escape  punishment,  it  is  a  civil  contempt  proceeding.

,  481  A.2d  648,  652  (Pa.  Super.  1984).  “If  the  dominant  purpose  of  the 
Commonwealth  v.  Pruitt
court is to prospectively coerce the contemnor into compliance with the court’s 
, 
directive,  the  adjudication  is  one  of  civil  contempt.” 
764 A.2d 569, 574 (Pa. Super. 2000).  The purge amount set by the court must be 
within the present ability of the defendant to comply, and the court must make 
that finding beyond a reasonable doubt.

E.  Payments During Incarceration

 
Both  the  Department  of  Corrections  and  county  prisons  automatically  deduct 
restitution  from  an  inmate’s  account.  Section  9728(b)(5) of  the  Sentencing  Code  was

Section  9728,  the  Department  of  Corrections  and  county  correctional  facilities  were 
treated the same for purposes of making deductions and transmitting amounts under this 
subsection. As amended, the legislature now has seen fit to require that the Department 
of  Corrections  deduct  at  least  25%  of  an 
inmate’s  wages  and  personal  accounts  for 
purposes  of  the  amounts  owed,  and  with 
respect  to  county  correctional  facilities,  to 
authorize monetary deductions to fully satisfy any amounts owed in addition to any to 
 than 50% 
be collected for support. In addition, section 9728(g.1) provides that 
of all monies collected by a county probation department or other agency shall be used 
to pay restitution to victims until satisfaction of the defendant’s restitution obligation, 
although  a  sentencing  court  can  specify  a  higher  amount  if  it  wishes  to  prioritize 
payments of restitution. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9728(g.1).

A jury’s decisions in setting the amount of restitution sometimes plays a role in the 

Mandatory Restitution at Sentencing

sentencing court’s determination of full restitution. When a victim suffers a loss directly 
resulting from a defendant’s crime, the Sentencing Code provides that a court shall order 
full restitution to a victim, regardless of the current financial resources of a defendant so 
as to provide a victim with the fullest compensation for a loss. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c).

  Therefore, it was held in 

 that an order of restitution, supported by the 
record,  for  property  damage  resulting  directly  from  a  defendant’s  criminal 
conduct in the amount of $20,745.82, was not an abuse of the court’s discretion, 
even though the misdemeanor crimes for which the defendant was convicted 
only  required  that  the  jury  determine  the  loss  to  be  more  than  $1,000.00, 
but	 less	 than	 $5,000.00.	  	 Once	 a	 defendant	 has	 been	 convicted	 of	 a	 crime

consideration of the underlying conviction, since the purpose of restitution is 
to make the victim whole.

, the victim suffered damages to crops and two pieces of farm 
In 
equipment as a direct result of the criminal conduct.  However, at the time 
of trial, only one of the pieces of farm equipment had estimates and repair 
bills available for evidence.  Accordingly, the jury only had before it the loss 
of  the  single  piece  of  farm  equipment.  After  the  defendant’s  conviction, 
and at the time of sentencing, the prosecution presented evidence of the 
repair costs of the other piece of equipment.  Therefore, because the victim 
had now provided, and the Commonwealth moved into evidence, the total 
damages for both pieces of equipment, the trial court ordered restitution 
in this total amount. The Superior Court affirmed, holding that although 
the jury had made a determination for grading purposes, the sentencing 
court could award restitution beyond that amount because the record, at 
the time of sentencing, supported the order.

ommonwealth v. Holmes

In 

 
, 155 A.3d 69 (Pa. Super. 2018), the Superior Court had 
occasion to discuss the difference in discharge between an order of restitution under 
Section 1106(a) and an order providing for restitution as a condition of probation under 
Section 9754.  As explained, an order of restitution for losses resulting directly from a 
defendant’s criminal conduct under Section 1106(a) is not discharged until paid in full, 
whereas any unpaid restitution ordered as a condition of probation is discharged upon 
completion of probation.  The Court stated  

  Harner,

When a victim suffers injury to person or property, a sentencing court 
is  mandated  under  Section  1106(a)  to  enter  an  order  of  restitution. 
Restitution  under  Section  1106(a),  as  part  of  a  sentence,  is  penal 
in  character  and  is  imposed  for  losses  for  which  a  defendant  has 
been  held  criminally  accountable.
  617  A.2d  at  706.  When 
restitution  is  issued  under  Section  1106(a),  a  sentencing  court  is 
obligated  to  order  full  restitution  regardless  of  the  current  financial 
resources of a defendant. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(i). Once an order 
of restitution has been made as part of a defendant’s sentence under 
Section 1106(a), it is enforceable until paid. 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(2)
(ii); 

,15 A.3d 73, 75 (Pa. Super. 2010).

Commonwealth v. Griffiths

In contrast, restitution may be ordered under Section 9754(c)(8) as 
a condition of probation. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9754(c)(8). When ordered as 
a  condition  of  probation  a  court  may  order  a  defendant  “[t]o  make 
restitution  of  the  fruits  of  his  crime  or  to  make  reparations,  in  an 
Id.
amount he can afford to pay, for the loss or damage caused thereby.” 
  Unlike  restitution  under  Section  1106(a)  that  serves  a  punitive 
purpose, restitution ordered as a condition of probation under Section 
9754(c)(8)  is  primarily  aimed  at  rehabilitating  and  integrating  a 
defendant  into  society  as  a  law-abiding  citizen  and  is  deemed  a 
Hall, supra

action, to recover from the offender for property or personal injury damages, provided, 
however,  that any civil award will be reduced by the amount paid under the criminal 
judgment.(g)  Preservation  of  private  remedies

Victim’s Insurance 

A victim is entitled to restitution regardless of whether the victim has submitted an 

 
insurance claim or has been partially or fully reimbursed by the victim’s insurer. 

[A] defendant, as part of a sentencing scheme, can be directed to make 
restitution to a victim injured by the defendant’s conduct, even though 
the victim has already been paid through a civil settlement or when 
the victim receives compensation from the victim’s insurer for the loss

authority to impose restitution

A  challenge  to  the  trial  court’s  imposition  of  restitution  falls  into  one  of  two 
 
categories: a legality challenge or a discretionary challenge. The appellate courts have 
drawn  a  distinction  between  those  cases  where  the  challenge  is  directed  to  the  trial 
 (legal challenge) and those cases where the 
court’s 
challenge is premised upon a claim that 
  (challenge 
to discretionary aspects of sentence).

– challenge directed to the 
trial court’s statutory authority to impose restitution, - considered a

A challenge to a court’s authority to impose restitution is generally considered to 
 
be a challenge to the legality of the sentence. 
 101 A.3d 813 
(Pa. Super. 2014). These challengers include when there is an appeal on the basis that 
the restitution order is unsupported by the record, or inapplicable to a certain crime.  It 
is well-settled that “[i]f no statutory authorization exists for a particular sentence, that 
sentence is illegal  and subject  to correction.”

In the context of issue preservation principles, Section 1106 requires 
an  integrated  analysis  of  its  relevant  provisions.  Section  1106(a) 
is  mandatory  in  its  directive  and  removes  any  discretion  from  the 
sentencing court to impose restitution as punishment upon conviction 
of a crime under two circumstances: where the property of a victim 
has  been  stolen,  converted  or  otherwise  unlawfully  obtained  or  its 
value has been substantially decreased as a direct consequence of the

1106(a)(2).  Thus,  the  failure  of  a  trial  court  to  impose  restitution 
where the circumstances described in Section 1106(a)(1) or (2) are 
established results in an illegal sentence. Conversely, and as relevant 
to  a  defendant’s  challenge,  if  the  statutory  circumstances  are  not 
established and the sentencing court orders restitution, the challenge 
to  the  sentence  implicates  its  legality.  In  either  of  these  sentencing 
scenarios,  a  challenge  to  the  sentence  of  restitution  need  not  be 
preserved.

As  to  a  challenge  to  the  discretionary  aspects  of  a  sentence  which  includes  a 

 
restitution order, the Supreme Court stated:

Moreover,  the  discretionary  nature  of  the  amount  of  restitution 
is  established  in  Section  1106(c)(2),  which  sets  forth  the  factors 
to  be  considered  by  the  sentencing  court  in  fashioning  an  award  of 
restitution:  “...  the  court  shall  consider  the  extent  of  injury  suffered

by the victim, the victim’s request for restitution as presented to the 
district attorney ... and such other matters as it deems appropriate.” 
18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(2)(i). This language, placing the determination of 
the amount of restitution under the sentencing court’s consideration 
based on the stated factors and “other matters it deems appropriate,” is 
the clearest possible indication of the General Assembly’s recognition 
that fashioning the restitution order remained in the exercise of the 
sentencing  court’s  discretion.  [An  appellant’s]  discontent  with  the 
amount  of  restitution  and  the  evidence  supporting  it  is  a  challenge 
to the sentencing court’s exercise of discretion, not to the legality of 
the sentence. To access review of his challenge by the Superior Court, 
[an appellant is] required to file a Pa.R.A.P 2119(f) statement in his

from  is  not  appropriate  under  the  Sentencing  Code,  42  Pa.C.S.A.  § 
9781(b).
Commonwealth v. Moury

, 992 A.2d 62, 170 (Pa. Super. 2010).

The standard of review in an appeal from the discretionary aspects of a sentence is 

 
well settled:

Sentencing is a matter vested in the sound discretion of the sentencing 
judge,  and  a  sentence  will  not  be  disturbed  on  appeal  absent  a 
manifest abuse of discretion. In this context, an abuse of discretion is 
not shown merely by an error in judgment. Rather, the appellant must 
establish, by reference to the record, that the sentencing court ignored 
or misapplied the law, exercised its judgment for reasons of partiality, 
prejudice,  bias  or  ill  will,  or  arrived  at  a  manifestly  unreasonable 
decision.

Chapter Three

I. GENERALLY

A. Introductory Note

Effective December 18, 2019, the Pennsylvania legislature amended Title 42.  Among 
 
other things, the amendments eliminated state and county intermediate punishments 
as sentencing alternatives and renumbered the section titled “conditions of probation” 
from 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9754 to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763.  For ease of understanding and for faster 
reference,  within  this  chapter,  we  have  changed  all  instances  of  the  prior  statutory 
numbering to the current numbering. 
B. Introductory Warning

In  cases  where  there  exists  a  statutorily  defined  “victim”  who,  as  a  result  of  the 
 
crime,  suffers  damage  or  injury  to  their  person  or  property,  the  sentencing  court  is

(providing for mandatory restitution “

Full discussion regarding the mandatory restitution provisions of the Crimes Code and 
the Sentencing Code is beyond the scope of this chapter.  We direct the sentencing court 
to review those sections, as well as Chapter Two of this book, case law interpreting those 
sections, and 18 P.S. § 11.103 (defining the term “victim” for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 
9721(c) and defining, in part, the term “victim” for purposes of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106), for 
consideration as to whether those statutes are applicable to the facts of the case.

Commonwealth  v.  Hall

In 

 
Court declared:

,  80  A.3d  1204  (Pa.  2013),  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme 

As  described  in  [42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  9763(b)(10)],  monetary  conditions 
of  probation  may  be  for  the  purpose  of  “restitution”  or  “to  make 
reparations”  for  the  loss  or  damage  caused  by  the  crime,  but  they 
must be limited to an amount the defendant “can afford to pay.” . . .
[T]he common dictionary definitions of the terms used in [42 Pa.C.S.A. 
§ 9763(b)(10)] are somewhat general.  “Restitution” has been defined 
as:  “a giving back to the rightful owner of something that has been lost 
or taken away; restoration” and “a making good for loss or damage; 
reimbursement.”  Webster’s New World Dictionary 1212 (2nd College 
ed.  1986).    The  legal  definition  of  “restitution”  is:    “[c]ompensation 
of  a  loss;  esp.,  full  or  partial  compensation  paid  by  a  criminal  to  a 
victim,  .  .  .  ordered  as  part  of  a  criminal  sentence  or  as  a  condition 
of  probation.”    Black’s  Law  Dictionary  1339  (8th  ed.  2004).  [The 
Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court]  has  explained  that  restitution  “refers 
to  compensation  required  for  the  wrongful  appropriation  of  money

Likewise,

describes “a making of amends; making up for a wrong or injury” and 
“compensation . . .  for crimes committed against individuals; payable 
in  money,  labor,  goods,  etc.”    Webster’s  at  1204.    The  legal  definition 
(a) General rule.--In imposing an order of probation the court shall specify at the time of sentencing the 
length of any term during which the defendant is to be supervised, which term may not exceed the maximum 
term for which the defendant could be confined, and the authority that shall conduct the supervision. The 
court shall consider probation guidelines adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing under 
sections 2154 (relating to adoption of guidelines for sentencing) and 2154.1 (relating to adoption of guidelines 
for restrictive conditions).

(b) Conditions generally.--The court shall attach reasonable conditions authorized by section 9763 (relating to

E. Purposes Served 

See  Commonwealth  v.  Veon

 
Criminal sentencing essentially serves one or more of the following four purposes:  
“(1) deterrence, (2) incapacitation, (3) rehabilitation, [and] (4) retribution.”  Arthur W. 
Campbell, Law Of Sentencing § 2.1.  The primary purpose of any order of restitution 
(whether  imposed  as  a  direct  sentence  under  18  Pa.C.S.A.  §  1106,  as  a  condition  of 
probation under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763, or as an order of disposition of a delinquent child 
,  150  A.3d 
under  42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  6352)  is  rehabilitation.   
435, 451 (Pa. 2016) (in considering the mandatory restitution statute of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 
1106(c), the Supreme Court held:  “the primary purpose of restitution is rehabilitation 
of  the  offender.    Consequently,  recompense  to  the  victim  is  only  a  secondary  benefit, 
as  restitution  is  not  an  award  of  damages,  a  proposition  reinforced  by  the  General 
Assembly’s 1998 amendment of Section 1106 making restitution mandatory rather than 
discretionary”) (quotations and some citations omitted);

juvenile court to order “payment by the child of reasonable amounts of money as fines, 
costs, fees or restitution as deemed appropriate as part of the plan of rehabilitation”).  
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained:

Commonwealth v. Petrick

generally  speaking,  restitution  is  the  requirement  that  the  criminal 
offender repay, as a condition of his sentence, the victim or society, in 
money or services.  It is well established that the primary purpose of 
restitution is rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him or 
her that his [or her] criminal conduct caused the victim’s loss or personal 
injury and that it is his [or her] responsibility to repair the loss or injury 
as far as possible.  Thus, recompense to the victim is only a secondary 
2   In earlier cases, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated that, when imposed as a direct sentence under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106, restitution 
benefit, as restitution is not an award of damages.  Although restitution 
serves a “primarily punitive” purpose.  See Commonwealth v. Harner, 617 A.2d 702, 704 (Pa. 1992) (“where restitution is imposed in 
addition to a statutory punishment, such as imprisonment, the order must be strictly scrutinized since its purpose is primarily punitive”); 
Commonwealth v. Walton, 397 A.2d 1179, 1184 (Pa. 1979) (same).  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has, sub silentio, retreated from 
this statement in recent years and now holds that the “primary purpose of restitution is rehabilitation of the offender.”  Commonwealth 
v. Brown, 981 A.2d 893, 895-896 (Pa. 2009); Veon, 150 A.3d at 451; Petrick, 217 A.3d at 1225 1226.

is penal in nature, it is highly favored in the law and encouraged so that 
the  criminal  will  understand  the  egregiousness  of  his  or  her  conduct, 
be  deterred  from  repeating  the  conduct,  and  be  encouraged  to  live  in

Id

 

The Pennsylvania Superior Court explained:

Whether imposed as a direct sentence or as a condition thereof (e.g., 
condition  of  probation),  the  primary  purpose  of  restitution  is  the 
rehabilitation  of  the  offender.    It  is  true  that  restitution  helps  the 
victim,  but  this  fact  is  secondary  to  the  reality  that  restitution  is  an 
aspect  of  sentencing  imposed  by  a  court  on  an  offender  in  order  to 
facilitate the administration of criminal justice. 

Various  characteristics  of  restitution  further  illustrate  that  its  true 
nature is that of a criminal sanction. For example, while a crime victim 
certainly  may  ask  the  district  attorney  to  seek  restitution,  it  is  the 
district attorney who has the authority to present that request to the 
court.    Moreover,  an  order  of  restitution  does  not  create  a  creditor-
debtor relationship between the victim and the offender.  Unlike a civil 
judgment,  the  victim  has  no  standing  to  enforce  a  restitution  order.   
Instead, restitution can only be enforced by the criminal court, just as 
penalties of incarceration or probation are within the court’s exclusive 
purview.  . . . In the end, restitution is simply not an award of damages 
but, rather, a sentence.

H. Restitution Encouraged

 

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated:

the practice of ordering restitution or reparation as [] a condition [of 
probation] is widely established and highly favored in the law, as an 
aid both to the criminal in achieving rehabilitation and to his victim in 
obtaining some measure of redress. 

Such sentences are encouraged and give the trial court the flexibility to 
determine all the direct and indirect damages caused by a defendant 
and then permit the court to order restitution so that the defendant 
will  understand  the  egregiousness  of  his  conduct,  be  deterred  from 
repeating this conduct, and be encouraged to live in a responsible way.

A  restitution  order  imposed  in  a  criminal  proceeding  is  not  dischargeable  in  a 
liquidation  or  “straight  bankruptcy”  proceeding  under  Chapter  7  of  the  Bankruptcy 
:    “[11  U.S.C.]  §

Commonwealth  v.  Petrick

In 

,  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  specifically  held:   
 
“[h]aving  determined  that  the  basis  for  restitution  orders  in  Pennsylvania  remains 
focused on the rehabilitative needs of defendants, we conclude the holding of the United 
,  217  A.3d  1217, 
States  Supreme  Court  in

Pa.C.S.A. § 1106, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held:

Commonwealth  v.  Petrick

  applies.”   

Kelly

Because  the  mandatory  restitution  order  serves  criminal  justice 
goals, restitution orders remain distinct from civil debt liability with 
respect to discharge in bankruptcy. This distinction is unaffected by 
the temporal relationship between the proceedings in the bankruptcy 
court and the criminal prosecution.  Additionally, it is unaffected by a 
creditor’s participation in the bankruptcy proceedings.

Id.

 
Further,  the  automatic  stay  provision  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  does  not  apply  to 
restitution.  Because the collection of restitution is a continuation of a criminal action, 
a state court may proceed with a criminal prosecution without violating the automatic 
stay provisions of bankruptcy law:

The  plain  language  of  §  362(b)(1)  exempts  the  “commencement  or 
continuation  of  a  criminal  action  or  proceeding  against  the  debtor” 
from the automatic stay afforded by § 362(a).

On  appeal,  the  defendant  claimed  the  trial  court  did  not  have  authority  to  order 
 
her  to  pay  restitution  to  Carmichaels  Borough.    Among  other  things,  the  defendant 
claimed  that,  in 
,  150  A.3d  435  (Pa.  2016),  the  Pennsylvania

Supreme Court “concluded that, with some limited exceptions, only a human being may 
be considered a victim entitled to recover restitution under Section 1106.”

Id.

As the Court initially noted, “pursuant to 

 
 and its progeny, a sentence directing 
[the defendant] to pay restitution to Carmichaels Borough under Section 1106 would 
[indeed] be illegal.”  
  However, in this case, the trial court imposed restitution as a 
condition of the defendant’s probation, under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10).  The Superior 
Court held that, in contrast to 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10) does not 
expressly limit the individuals or entities that may receive restitution as a condition of 
a defendant’s probation – and nothing prohibited the trial court from ordering that the 
defendant pay restitution to a municipality as a condition of her probation.  Thus, the 
Superior Court held that the restitution order was proper.

Thus, the requirement of a nexus between the damage and the offense 
is relaxed where restitution is ordered as a condition of probation.

, 976 A.2d 1191, 1193 (Pa. Super. 2009) (“where restitution 
is imposed as a condition of probation, the required nexus is relaxed.  While restitution 
cannot be indiscriminate, an indirect connection between the criminal activity and the 
loss  is  sufficient.    Thus,  even  without  direct  causation,  a  court  may  properly  impose 
restitution  as  a  probationary  condition  if  the  court  is  satisfied  that  the  restitution  is 
designed to rehabilitate the defendant and to make some measure of reimbursement to 
the victim”) (quotations, citations, and corrections omitted).

 
Even  under  this  relatively  lax  standard,  the  Pennsylvania  Superior  Court  has 
stressed  that,  for  restitution  imposed  as  a  condition  of  probation,  “there  must  be  at 
least  an  indirect  connection  between  the  criminal  activity  and  the  loss.  Additionally, 
4    The Pennsylvania Superior Court has explained direct causation under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106:
to the extent a sentence of probation is imposed to make restitution for losses caused 
when a victim suffers injury to person or property, a sentencing court is mandated under § 1106(a) to enter an 
order of restitution for the loss or damage directly resulting from the crime. 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(a). . . .

Because of the statutory language “directly resulting from the crime,” restitution under § 1106(a) is proper only 
if there is a direct causal connection between the crime and the loss.  [Commonwealth v. Harner, 617 A.2d 702, 
706 (Pa. 1992)] (stating that § 1106(a) “is clear on its face and applies only for those crimes to property or person 
where there has been a loss that flows from the conduct which forms the basis of the crime for which a defendant 
is held criminally accountable”). Thus, the sentencing court is statutorily required to impose restitution under 
§ 1106(a) when the Commonwealth has established that the defendant committed a crime, the victim suffered 
injury to person or property, and there exists a direct causal nexus between the crime of which defendant was 
convicted and the loss or damage suffered by the victim.  See 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(a); see also Commonwealth v. 
Pappas, 845 A.2d 829, 842 (Pa. Super. 2004) (holding that restitution under § 1106(a) may be imposed only for 
those crimes to property or person where the victim suffered a loss that flows from the conduct that forms the 
basis of the crime for which the defendant is held criminally accountable).

defendant to pay this restitution, as a condition of his probation, for the indirect damage 
his criminal activity caused.  The Superior Court reasoned:  

We  recognize  that  a  restitution  order  as  a  condition  of  probation 
cannot be indiscriminate.  It is true that the court in this case heard 
no testimony as to how [the defendant] obtained the CD player, and 
“assumed he paid 20 bucks on the street from some unknown guys.”  
However, the verdict means [the defendant] was convicted of buying 
the goods, and he either knew they were stolen or reasonably should 
have known they were stolen. We note that [the trial court] reasoned 
that “if those people aren’t out there buying stolen property, people 
aren’t  breaking  in.”    In  other  words,  [the  defendant]  provided  a 
market  for  that  person  who  is  criminally  responsible  for  the  break-
in  and  damage  to  the  truck.    While  this  would  not  be  enough  to  be

The Court reasoned:

following  the  acquittal  on  the  assault  charges  with  respect  [to  the 
stabbing of the victim], the jury finding indicates that [the defendant] 
was not directly responsible for the injuries to [the victim].  However, 
[the  defendant]  could  be  held  to  be  indirectly  responsible  for  them.   
It is not certain from the jury’s verdict whether [the victim] was cut 
accidentally  during  the  scuffle,  or  whether  he  was  stabbed  in  self-
defense  because  he  was  choking  [the  defendant].  In  either  event,

While  driving,  [the  defendant]  did  not  wreck  into  another  vehicle, 
collide  with  property,  strike  a  pedestrian  or  injure  anyone.    In 
fact,  the  restitution  had  nothing  to  do  with  any  such  matters.    [The 
defendant’s] drunk driving did not directly cause the officers to require 
precautionary blood testing.  Therefore, the direct nexus required by 
§ 1106(a) is lacking, and the statute does not authorize, as part of the 
DUI sentence, restitution for the blood tests in this case.

Second,  [the  defendant]  was  not  placed  on  probation  for  DUI.   
Therefore, we cannot affirm the restitution as a condition of probation 
under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § [9763(b)(10)].

However, the 

 Court held that the restitution order was permissible as a 
 
condition of (the now-repealed) county intermediate punishment restitution provision.  
The Superior Court held:

[The  defendant]  was  .  .  .  ordered  to  serve  intermediate  punishment 
as part of the DUI sentence.  While the act of spitting was plainly not 
the same as drunk driving, it certainly was a part of [the defendant’s] 
overall conduct which stemmed from her DUI.  We believe that there 
is  an  undeniable,  albeit  indirect,  link  connecting  [the  defendant’s] 
drunk  driving,  her  presence  at  the  hospital  for  DUI  blood  alcohol 
testing, her act of spitting on officers who arrested her for DUI, and 
their need for precautionary blood testing.  Restitution will serve the 
purposes of helping to teach [the defendant] the egregiousness of her 
conduct, to deter her from re-offending, and to encourage her to live 
responsibly.  The restitution also will provide reimbursement to the 
Commonwealth  v.  Colon,
insurance  company.  The  insurance  company  is  properly  considered 
to  be  a  victim  for  restitution  purposes.  [
 
708  A.2d  1279,  1281  (Pa.  Super.  1998)]  (finding  that  restitution  to 
insurer was a proper condition of intermediate punishment imposed 
for  DUI  conviction).    Based  on  the  foregoing  analysis,  we  find  that 
the restitution is supportable as a condition of [county intermediate 
punishment].

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

The Superior Court summarized the underlying facts:  

[The defendant] was driving a car belonging to her purported common 
law husband when it collided with the vehicle in front of her, which 
was owned and operated by [the victim].  [The victim’s] vehicle struck 
the vehicle in front of him.  [The victim] was injured and his vehicle 
“totaled.”  [The defendant], who was driving with a suspended license, 
told [the victim] to pull over to exchange information, but when he did, 
[the defendant] fled.  [The victim] had no collision coverage.  Because 
[the  defendant]  was  driving  while  her  license  was  suspended,  her 
insurance company refused to indemnify [the victim’s] loss.

Commonwealth v. Nuse,

 976 A.2d 1191, 1192 (Pa. Super. 2009).

The defendant pleaded guilty to “accidents involving damage to an attended vehicle 
 
or  property”  and  “driving  while  operating  privilege  is  suspended  or  revoked.”    At 
sentencing, the trial court ordered the defendant “to pay restitution to [the victim] in 
the amount of $5,224.69, his property loss, as a condition of probation.”  

Id. 

 
The  defendant  appealed  and  claimed  that  the  restitution  order  was  erroneous 
because “the loss resulted from the accident, not from her criminal act of leaving the 
scene of an accident involving damage to the attended vehicle.”  
 Court found 
the claim meritless and held that the restitution order was permissible as a condition of 
the defendant’s probation:

919  A.2d  234  (Pa.  Super.  2007)].    Burglary  is  not  an  element  of  the 
crime of receiving stolen property. 
 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3925.  Spitting on 
an officer is not an element of a DUI offense.  Yet, this Court concluded 
that there was still a sufficient indirect connection between the damage 
and  the  criminal  conduct  in  both 
[].  Here,  it  is 
uncontested that defendant struck the victim’s vehicle causing damage, 
and then left the scene of the accident.  Causing damage to an attended 
vehicle  is  a  pre-requisite  element  of  the  crime  to  which  defendant 
pleaded guilty, creating a more direct connection between the damage 
and the criminal conduct than in either of the aforementioned cases.  
Furthermore, [the victim’s] vehicle would not have been damaged if 
[the  defendant]  had  not  been  driving,  as  she  should  not  have  been 
given the suspension of her license, the companion offense to which 
she pleaded guilty.  The facts of record support a finding of at least an 
indirect connection between the damage and the commission of either 
crime.

The Court reasoned that, since there was no permanent loss and no property damage, 
the trial court could not impose restitution as a condition of probation under either 42 
5
Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10) or the ”catchall” provision in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b):
 

 [Commonwealth 
Although [the employer] was temporarily deprived of its property, it 
v. Hall
suffered no permanent loss as a result of the theft. See

, 994 A.2d 1141, 1145 n. 3 (Pa. Super. 2010) (en banc), affirmed 
on  other  grounds,  80  A.3d  1204  (Pa.  2013)]  (stating  that  “to  the 
extent  a  sentence  of  probation  is  imposed  to  make  restitution  for 
losses  caused  by  the  defendant’s  criminal  conduct,  there  should  be 
proof of the damages suffered”).  Further, [the Pennsylvania Superior] 
Court  has  stated  that  “a  court  may  properly  impose  restitution  as  a 
probationary condition if the court is satisfied that the restitution is 
designed  to  rehabilitate  the  defendant  and  to  make  some  measure 
of  reimbursement  to  the  victim.”    [
,  919 
A.2d 234, 238 (Pa. Super. 2007)].  Here, the sentencing court ordered 
[the  defendant]  to  pay  $3,010.41  in  restitution  to  [the  employer]  as 
a condition of [the defendant’s] probation.  However, [the employer] 
suffered no loss, and, therefore, the sentencing court’s imposition of 
See  Harriott
restitution could not have been designed to reimburse [the employer].  
5    The “catchall” probationary condition is now found at 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(15).  It currently reads:  “[t]he court may attach any of

the following conditions upon the defendant as it deems necessary: . . . (15) To do other things reasonably related to rehabilitation.”  42 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(15).  We note that this provision is worded slightly differently than the catchall provision that existed at the time 
Kinnan was decided.  See Kinnan, 71 A.3d at 987-988 (quoting the catchall provision that existed at the time).

impose restitution as a probationary condition if the court is satisfied 
that  the  restitution  is  designed  [(1)]  to  rehabilitate  the  defendant[;] 
and [(2)] to make some measure of reimbursement to the victim.”

. . .

In  its  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(a)  Opinion,  the  sentencing  court  explained 
that  its  imposition  of  restitution  as  a  probationary  condition  was 
[rehabilitative] in nature and opined that this condition was authorized 
by  [the  “catchall”  probation  condition,  which,  at  the  time,  provided 
that,  as  a  condition  of  probation,  a  sentencing  court  may  order  a 
defendant “[t]o satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the 
rehabilitation of the defendant and not unduly restrictive of his liberty 
or  incompatible  with  his  freedom  of  conscience”].    However,  after  a 
thorough review of the case law interpreting section 97[63], we cannot 
agree  that  [the  “catchall”  provision]  authorized  the  imposition  of 
restitution under the circumstances of this case.  There is no appellate 
case  in  Pennsylvania  upholding  a  sentencing  court’s  imposition  of 
restitution as a condition of probation under [the “catchall” provision] 
where, as here, the victim of the crime suffered no permanent loss.

The 

 
 Court concluded that the trial court improperly ordered restitution as 
a condition of probation under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763.  Therefore, the Court vacated the 
illegal sentence and remanded for resentencing.  
5. Amount of Restitution in Relation to the Loss

 at 988.

Id.

  When mandatory restitution is imposed as a direct sentence, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106 
demands that the sentencing court “order full restitution . . . so as to provide the victim 
with the fullest compensation for the loss.”  18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(1)(i).  On the other 
hand,  when  restitution  is  imposed  as  a  condition  of  probation  under  42  Pa.C.S.A.  § 
9763(b)(10), the statute declares that the trial court “may” require the defendant “[t]
o  make  restitution  of  the  fruits  of  the  crime  or  to  make  reparations,  in  an  affordable 
amount and on a schedule that the defendant can afford to pay, for the loss or damage 
caused by the crime.”  42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10).  

 
As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held, Section 9763 provides the sentencing 
court with a broad measure of discretion to fashion an award of restitution as a condition 
Commonwealth v. Hall
of  probation  that  is  “appropriate  to  the  circumstances  of  the  individual  case.”    See 
, 397 
A.2d 1179, 1184 (Pa. 1979) (“courts . . . are traditionally and properly invested with a 
broader measure of discretion in fashioning conditions of probation appropriate to the

, 80 A.3d 1204, 1215 (Pa. 2013);

circumstances of the individual case”).  However, this discretion is not unbridled and, 
when restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, the restitution order cannot be 
indiscriminate,  speculative,  or  excessive.    Rather,  “[b]ecause  restitution  is  a  sentence, 
, 201 
the amount ordered must be supported by the record.”

has caused, what amount of restitution he can afford to pay[,] and how he should pay 
Hall,
it.”

appeal  granted

  80  A.3d  at  1216  (holding  that  the  trial  court’s  probationary  condition  that  the 
defendant pay $200.00 per month in child support, to support the children of the victim 
he killed, failed, in part, because “the award here seems so speculative, as a matter of 
child support, as to approach being arbitrary.  . . . There is, in fact, nothing in the record to 
reflect how the court fixed the support amount at $200 monthly. Nor did the court make 
findings regarding the actual financial needs of the victim’s children (including needs 
unmet by the resources available to their mother), or to what extent the victim actually 
provided financial support for his children — in any dollar amount — prior to his death.  
Rather,  the  amount  fixed  by  the  court  seems  to  be  unmoored  —  and  perhaps  purely 
symbolic.  . . . The probationary condition imposed by the trial court is not sustainable 
on the record here”).
6. Determination of the Defendant’s Ability to Pay 

 
Under the mandatory restitution provision of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106, the sentencing 
court “shall order full restitution . . . [r]egardless of the current financial resources of 
the defendant, so as to provide the victim with the fullest compensation for the loss.”  
6
18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c).
   Thus, under Section 1106(c), the sentencing court is required 
to order full restitution, regardless of the defendant’s ability to pay.  Contrariwise, when 
restitution is ordered as a condition of probation under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10), the 
statute requires the trial court to determine “what loss or damage has been caused, and 
Commonwealth v. Harner
what amount of restitution [the defendant] can afford to pay, and how it should be paid.” 
, 617 A.2d 702, 707 (Pa. 1992) (footnote omitted).  The trial 
court may then only order the defendant to make restitution as a condition of probation 
“in an affordable amount and on a schedule that the defendant can afford to pay.”  42 
Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10).
7. Expiration of Payment Obligation

6  18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(2)(iii) goes on to say:  “the court . . . [s]hall not order incarceration of a defendant for failure to pay restitution if 
the failure results from the offender’s inability to pay.”  18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(c)(2)(iii); see also 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106(f) (procedure when the 
“offender shall fail to make [mandatory] restitution”); Commonwealth v. Rush, 909 A.2d 805, 811 (Pa. Super. 2006) (under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 
1106, “the court need not consider the defendant’s ability to pay at the time of imposing restitution[;] the defendant’s ability to pay need 
only be considered upon default”); Commonwealth v. Petrick, 217 A.3d 1217, 1225 (Pa. 2019) (declaring that, while Section 1106 requires 
that the original sentencing court order mandatory, full restitution regardless of the defendant’s ability to pay, “[t]he Legislature did not 
foreclose a sentencing court’s consideration of a defendant’s ability to pay restitution; it merely eliminated ability to pay as a prerequisite 
consideration. . . .  The Legislature simply placed the consideration of a defendant’s ability to pay at the more pertinent stage, when a 
sentencing court must assess a defendant’s compliance with the order”).

The Comment to Rule 705.1 states:

Comment:

  This  rule  provides  the  procedures  for  the  statutory 
requirement for the judge to impose restitution. In all cases in which 
restitution is imposed, the sentencing judge must state on the record 
  18  Pa.C.S.  § 
the  amount  of  restitution  at  the  time  of  sentencing. 
1106 and 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9721, 9728.
See,  e.g

See

., 
The  extent  of  restitution  also  may  be  provided  by  statute. 
18 Pa.C.S. § 1107 (restitution for timber theft); § 1107.1 (restitution 
for identity theft); and § 1110 (restitution for cleanup of clandestine 
labs).

When  imposing  restitution,  the  sentencing  judge  should  consider 
whether  the  defendant  has  received  notice  of  the  intention  to  seek 
restitution  prior  to  the  hearing  and  whether  the  defendant  intends 
to object to the imposition of restitution. The sentencing hearing may 
need to be continued as a result.
Paragraph  (B)(6)  requires  that  the  sentencing  order  make  clear 

22      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

whether  any  restitution  is  being  imposed  as  a  part  of  the  sentence 
pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106 or as a condition of probation pursuant 
to 42 Pa.C.S. § 97[63]. 

Unlike  restitution  imposed  under  §  1106  that  is  penal  in  nature, 
restitution imposed as a condition of probation is primarily aimed at 
7
rehabilitation.
 Sentences of probation give a trial court the flexibility

B. Prior Notification

As stated in the comment to Rule 705.1, “[w]hen imposing restitution, the sentencing 
 
judge  should  consider  whether  the  defendant  has  received  notice  of  the  intention  to 
7     This  sentence  paraphrases  similar  language  found  in  a  Pennsylvania  Superior  Court  opinion  and  unpublished  Superior  Court 
memoranda.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Karth,  994  A.2d  606,  607  (Pa.  Super.  2010).    However,  the  sentence  can  cause  confusion.    The 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court has, many times, declared that restitution ordered under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106 is “penal in nature” (and, thus, 
that the statute must be strictly construed) and, in the same breath, declared that this type of restitution (like all restitution) serves the 
“primary purpose” of rehabilitation.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Runion, 662 A.2d 617, 618-619 (Pa. 1995) (holding that Section 1106 is 
a “penal provision” that demands a strict interpretation and also declaring:  “[i]t is a well-established principle that the primary purpose 
of restitution is rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him that his criminal conduct caused the victim’s loss or personal injury 
and that it is his responsibility to repair the loss or injury as far as possible”), superseded by statute as recognized in Commonwealth v. 
Veon, 150 A.3d 435, 450 (Pa. 2016); Commonwealth v. Brown, 981 A.2d 893, 895-896 (Pa. 2009) (speaking of restitution ordered under 18 
Pa.C.S.A. § 1106, the Supreme Court held:  “restitution is penal in nature.  . . . It is well established that the primary purpose of restitution 
is rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him or her that his criminal conduct caused the victim’s loss or personal injury and 
that it is his responsibility to repair the loss or injury as far as possible”).  Further, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently reaffirmed 
that mandatory restitution under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106 has, as its primary purpose, the rehabilitation of the offender.  Commonwealth v. 
Petrick, 217 A.3d 1217, 1225-1226 (Pa. 2019).

In addition, when restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, the restitution obligation is still a part of the judgment of sentence 
and it is still imposed by a sentencing court, at a criminal sentencing proceeding, and as the result of a criminal conviction.  Thus, like 
restitution imposed as a direct sentence under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106, restitution imposed as a condition of probation is undoubtedly “penal 
in nature.”  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hall, 80 A.3d 1204, 1212 (Pa. 2013) (“provisions for payment of monetary sums as the result of 
criminal convictions are penal in nature”).  

  Nevertheless, simply because a statute is penal does not mean that its primary purpose must be punitive, or that it cannot be rehabilitative.  
To be sure, criminal sentencing essentially serves one or more of the following four purposes:  “(1) deterrence, (2) incapacitation, (3) 
rehabilitation, [and] (4) retribution.”  Arthur W. Campbell, LAW OF SENTENCING § 2.1.  Thus, the criminal justice system is “concerned 
not only with punishing the offender, but also with rehabilitating him.”  Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 52 (1986).  As such, it is not 
contradictory to view restitution as penal in character, but having the primary purpose of rehabilitating the defendant.

C.f.  Commonwealth  v.  Zrncic

D. Restitution Must be Determined by the Trial Court at Sentencing

1. Generally

 
Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 705.1 clearly states that, for any restitution 
order,  the  judge  must  determine,  “[a]t  the  time  of  sentencing,  .  .  .  what  restitution,  if 
any, shall be imposed.”  Pa.R.Crim.P. 705.1(A).  Thus, regardless of whether restitution is 
imposed as a direct sentence (under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106) or as a condition of probation 
(under  42  Pa.C.S.A.  §  9763),  the  trial  court  must  determine,  at  sentencing,  and  then 
state, in the sentencing order: (1) the amount of restitution ordered; (2) the details of a 
payment plan, if any, including when payment is to begin; (3) the identity of the payee(s); 
(4) to which officer or agency the restitution payment shall be made; (5) whether any 
restitution has been paid and in what amount; and (6) whether the restitution has been 
imposed as a part of the sentence and/or as a condition of probation.  
 Pa.R.Crim.P. 
,  850  A.2d  712,  715  (Pa.  Super.  2004) 
705.1(B); 
(“whether [the restitution is imposed as] a condition of probation or a direct sentence, 
the amount and manner of restitution must be determined by the sentencing court”).

. [t]o make restitution of the fruits of the crime or to make reparations, in an affordable 
amount and on a schedule that the defendant can afford to pay, for the loss or damage 
caused by the crime”).
2. Non-Delegation

 

Also implicit in Rule 705.1 (and required by Pennsylvania case law), when restitution 
 
is imposed as a condition of probation, the trial court must itself determine the specifics 
of the restitution order, such as the amount and manner of restitution.  The trial court 
may not delegate this duty to an agency, such as a probation or parole department.  The 
Pennsylvania Superior Court held:

Even  if  [the  restitution  order]  were  a  condition  of  probation,  the 
sentencing  court  bears  the  duty  of  determining  the  specifics  of 
restitution.  The court is not free to delegate these duties to an agency.  
Here, the trial court improperly permitted the Fulton County Probation 
Department to determine the amount and recipients of restitution. . . .

Relatedly,  the  Pennsylvania  Board  of  Probation  and  Parole  “has  no  authority  to

of . . . restitution since the Board is without the authority to alter a judicially imposed 
sentence.”

3. Non-Waivable

Commonwealth v. Deshong

The  trial  court’s  failure  to  specify  restitution  at  the  time  of  sentencing,  and/or 
 
the  court’s  failure  to  determine  the  defendant’s  ability  to  pay  restitution,  and/or  the 
court’s  delegation  of  the  restitution  amount  to  an  agency  will  all  result  in  an  illegal

does not put the burden on defendants to inform the court that they might have trouble 
paying a fine.  Instead, it instructs sentencing courts not to impose a fine absent record 
evidence of the defendant’s ability to pay”).  Further, since the sentence is illegal, any 
claim challenging the illegal sentence “cannot be waived.”

the Sixth Amendment and Due Process Clause require questions of fact 
necessary to support restitution awards to be decided by juries under 
the  standard  of  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  Nearly  all  lower 
courts  have  concluded  that  jury  factfinding  is  not  constitutionally 
required in this setting, but the Supreme Court has not spoken to the

penal  in  nature.”

that the accepted procedure in Pennsylvania for imposing restitution as a condition of 
probation  is  to  allow  judges  to  determine,  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  all  of 
the direct and indirect losses and damages caused by the defendant and to use this as 
the basis for any restitution order.  Given that indirect damages are – by definition – not 
“submitted  to  a  jury[]  and  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,”  an  argument  may  be 
made that Pennsylvania’s procedure for imposing restitution as a condition of probation 
(if not its entire structure of permitting restitution on the basis of indirect damages) is 
unconstitutional.  
IV. TRIAL COURT CONSIDERATIONS

, 530 U.S. at 490.

See Apprendi

 
The Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing its entitlement to restitution 
and  the  trial  court  has  the  obligation  of  determining  the  amount  of  restitution  the 
defendant must pay and the specifics of any restitution order.  When imposing restitution 
27      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

as a condition of probation, the trial court must determine and/or state in the sentencing 
order:

1) All of the direct and indirect damages caused by the defendant;

2) What amount of restitution the defendant can afford to pay; 

3)  What  amount  of  restitution  the  defendant  must  pay,  “so  that  the  defendant  will 
understand the egregiousness of his conduct, be deterred from repeating this conduct, 
and be encouraged to live in a responsible way” (this amount is not necessarily equal to 
the amount of restitution the defendant can afford to pay – it may be less (but it may not 
be more));

4) The details of a payment plan, if any, including when payment is to begin;

5) The identity of the payee(s);

6) To which officer or agency the restitution payment shall be made; 

7) Whether any restitution has been paid and in what amount; and,

8)  Whether  the  restitution  has  been  imposed  as  a  part  of  the  sentence  and/or  as  a 
condition of probation.
A. Direct and Indirect Damages 

As noted above, when a trial court imposes restitution as a condition of probation, 
 
the trial court has the “flexibility to determine all the direct and indirect damages caused 
by a defendant and then [is] permit[ted] to order restitution so that the defendant will 
understand the egregiousness of his conduct, be deterred from repeating this conduct, 
, 617 A.2d 
and be encouraged to live in a responsible way.”  
Commonwealth v. Harriott
702,  707  (Pa.  1992)  (regarding  restitution  imposed  as  a  condition  of  probation); 
, 919 A.2d 234, 238 (Pa. Super. 2007) (regarding restitution 

Commonwealth v. Harner

imposed as a condition of (the now-repealed) county intermediate punishment).

 
Examples regarding restitution imposed for direct damages are found in Chapter 2 
of this book; examples regarding restitution imposed for indirect damages are found in 
Section I.J.4 of this Chapter.
B. Defendant’s Ability to Pay 

1. May not exceed the total amount of direct and indirect damages

28      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

 Commonwealth v. Griffiths
“An  order  of  restitution  is  a  sentence,  whether  it  is  imposed  as  a  direct  sentence 
 
or as a condition of probation.” 
, 15 A.3d 73, 77 (Pa. Super. 
2010).  “Because restitution is a sentence, the amount ordered must be supported by 
, 722 A.2d 
the record; it may not be speculative or excessive.”  
157, 159 (Pa. Super. 1998). Thus, in imposing restitution as a condition of probation, 
the trial court must ensure that the amount awarded does not exceed the total amount 
of direct and indirect damages proved by the Commonwealth – even if the defendant’s 
“ability to pay” exceeds the total amount of direct and indirect damages.
2. May not exceed the defendant’s ability to pay

Commonwealth v. Wright

Moreover, when restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, the restitution 
,  722  A.2d  at  159 

 
amount  must  not  “exceed  the  [defendant’s]  ability  to  pay.”   
(quotations and citations omitted).  

Wright

 
Although an order of restitution imposed as a condition of probation may not exceed 
the defendant’s ability to pay, “an order of restitution need not be in an amount which 
can be paid from a defendant’s current earnings.” 
, 595 A.2d 
1180, 1189 (Pa. Super. 1991).  The Superior Court explained:

Commonwealth v. Boyles

We  recognize  that,  in  most  cases,  when  a  court  sentences  the 
defendant  to  a  period  of  incarceration  and  the  defendant  is  serving 
the period of incarceration, his income will frequently be drastically 
diminished  and  consequently  he  may  not  be  able  immediately  to 
satisfy the sentence of restitution.  In fact, some defendants, at the time 
of  sentencing,  will  have  already  been  incarcerated  for  a  substantial 
period of time, and will have no income from which to pay restitution.  
However,  a  defendant’s  inability  to  presently  pay  restitution  at  the 
time  of  sentencing  or  immediately  thereafter  does  not  impede  the 
court’s authority to sentence the defendant to pay restitution if at the 
time of sentencing the record establishes the future possibility of the 
defendant satisfying the sentence of restitution.  “There is no rule of 
law which holds that a defendant can be ordered to make restitution 
Commonwealth  v.  Gallowa
only if he has a present financial ability to make immediate restitution.”  
y,  448  A.2d  568,  579  (Pa.  Super.  1982) 
(Wieand, J., concurring).  Thus, in determining the defendant’s ability 
to pay an  order of restitution, the court can consider the education, 
vocational training, and employment history of the defendant as they 
may affect the defendant’s future ability to make restitution in addition 
to considering any assets which defendant may have at present or is 
likely to acquire in the future and any present income.

that Defendant’s education and business experience, reflected in Defendant’s testimony

order”); 
, 457 A.2d 509, 514 (Pa. Super. 1982) (holding that,

business operations, all of which reflect on his potential capacity, giving consideration

a. Sacrifices may be required

 

The Pennsylvania Superior Court has stated:

In  many  instances  .  .  .  it  will  be  necessary  for  a  defendant  to  make 
substantial sacrifices in order to make restitution to the victims of his 
crimes.  This is not an obstacle to an order requiring such restitution.  
Rather, where sacrifice is necessary, the probationer or parolee may 
learn to consider more carefully the consequences of his or her acts 
and thereby strengthen the offender’s sense of responsibility.  Thus, 
an order of restitution may properly require additional or alternative 
employment, a reduction of expenses, and even a temporary change 
in  lifestyle  in  order  to  achieve  that  sense  of  responsibility  which 
signals  effective  rehabilitation.    The  true  rehabilitative  purpose  of 
restitution is well served when a probationer or parolee is called upon 
to make reasonable sacrifices in order to compensate those who have 
sustained losses as a result of his criminal conduct.  The rehabilitative 
goal is defeated only when the payments ordered by the court are so 
unreasonable in view of the defendant’s financial circumstances and 
ability to work that, despite good faith efforts, the defendant cannot 
hope to comply.

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

(1). Defendant may be required to sell property 

Commonwealth  v.  Madron

In 

 
,  the  trial  court  ordered  the  defendant  to  “make 
restitution jointly and severally with two co-defendants” to the victims, in the amount of 
$45,000.00.  On appeal, the defendant claimed that the restitution amount was excessive 
Commonwealth 
because “it cannot be paid from current income and will compel [the defendant] to sell a 
v. Madron, 
residence which she owns in order to make restitution to her victims.”  

488 A.2d 331, 332 (Pa. Super. 1985).  The Superior Court found this claim 

meritless.  It explained:

Where  the  defendant  owns  assets  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  make 
restitution,  he  or  she  may  be  called  upon  to  sell  or  borrow  on  the 
security of those assets and use the proceeds to make restitution. The 
rights of a victim to be made whole will not be made subservient to 
the criminal’s desire to retain an unencumbered title to capital assets.

In  the  instant  case,  the  record  discloses  that  [the  defendant]  is 
the  owner  of  a  residential  property  whose  value  is  approximately 
$60,000,  with  a  mortgage  of  less  than  $7,500.00.  This  suggests  that 
[the defendant’s] financial circumstances are adequate to allow her to 
make restitution for the losses of $45,000 which her criminal conduct 
caused  to  others.    Finding  no  abuse  of  discretion  on  the  part  of  the 
sentencing court, the judgment of sentence will be affirmed.

C. Determining the Total Amount of Restitution

 

As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained:

Restitution may [] be imposed as a condition of probation and, under 
such circumstances, the courts are traditionally and properly vested 
with  a  broader  measure  of  discretion  in  fashioning  conditions  of 
probation  appropriate  to  the  circumstances  of  the  individual  case. 
The  reason  for  this  attitude  stems  from  the  purpose  of  imposing 
conditions  of  probation  which  are  primarily  aimed  at  rehabilitating 
and reintegrating a law breaker into society as a law-abiding citizen. 
This is deemed a constructive alternative to imprisonment.

. . .

Commonwealth  v. 

Walton
As  [the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court]  noted  in  [

,  397  A.2d  1179,  1185  (Pa.  1979),]  the  practice  of  ordering 
restitution or reparation as such a condition is widely established and 

31      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

highly favored in the law, as an aid both to the criminal in achieving 
rehabilitation and to his victim in obtaining some measure of redress. 

Such sentences are encouraged and give the trial court the flexibility to 
determine all the direct and indirect damages caused by a defendant 
and then permit the court to order restitution so that the defendant 
will  understand  the  egregiousness  of  his  conduct,  be  deterred  from 
repeating this conduct, and be encouraged to live in a responsible way.

Commonwealth v. Harner,

 617 A.2d 702, 706-707 (Pa. 1992) (some citations omitted).

 
From  the  above  excerpt,  it  is  apparent  that  trial  courts  retain  broad  discretion 
to  impose  restitution  as  a  condition  of  probation  and,  correspondingly,  retain  broad 
discretion  to  fashion  an  appropriate  restitution  amount,  “so  that  the  defendant  will 
understand the egregiousness of his conduct, be deterred from repeating this conduct, 
and be encouraged to live in a responsible way.”  

 at 707.  

Id.

Therefore,  while  the  total  restitution  amount  may  not  exceed  the  total  amount 
 
of  direct  and  indirect  damages  or  the  defendant’s  ability  to  pay,  the  trial  court  is  not 
obligated  to  order  restitution  for  the  full  amount  of  the  defendant’s  ability  to  pay.  
Instead, if the trial court, in its discretion, determines that a lesser amount of restitution 
will make it “so that the defendant will understand the egregiousness of his conduct, be 
deterred from repeating this conduct, and be encouraged to live in a responsible way,” 
the trial court has the discretion to impose restitution at this lesser amount.

The  trial  court  must  then  expressly  state,  in  the  sentencing  order,  “the  amount  of 
restitution ordered.”  Pa.R.Crim.P. 705.1.

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9728 provides, in full:

§ 9728.  Collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and 
penalties

(a) General rule.--

(1)  Except  as  provided  in  subsection  (b)(5),  all  restitution, 
reparation,  fees,  costs,  fines  and  penalties  shall  be  collected  by 
the  county  probation  department  or  other  agent  designated  by 
the  county  commissioners  of  the  county  with  the  approval  of  the 
president  judge  of  the  county  for  that  purpose  in  any  manner 
provided by law. However, such restitution, reparation, fees, costs, 
fines and penalties are part of a criminal action or proceeding and 
shall  not  be  deemed  debts.  A  sentence,  pretrial  disposition  order 
or  order  entered  under  section  6352  (relating  to  disposition  of 
delinquent  child)  for  restitution,  reparation,  fees,  costs,  fines  or 
penalties shall, together with interest and any additional costs that 
may  accrue,  be  a  judgment  in  favor  of  the  probation  department 
upon the person or the property of the person sentenced or subject 
to the order.

(2)  In  accordance  with  section  9730.1  (relating  to  collection  of 
court costs, restitution and fines by private collection agency), the 
collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties 
under  this  section  may  be  referred  to  a  private  collection  agency. 
Any county that does not engage the services of a private collection 
agency  shall  operate  a  collections  enforcement  unit  consistent 
with  the  provisions  of  paragraph  (1)  and  dedicated  to  carrying 
out  the  duties  therein  provided.  Statistical  information  relating 
to  the  amount  of  restitution  collected  by  the  county  probation 
department or any agent designated by the county commissioners 
of the county with the approval of the president judge of the county 
shall  be  provided  to  the  Pennsylvania  Commission  on  Crime  and 
Delinquency  and  Pennsylvania  Commission  on  Sentencing  on 
an  annual  basis.  The  statistical  information  shall  be  sufficiently 

33      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

detailed  so  as  to  show  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this 
section, including subsection (g.1).

 

 

(b) Procedure.--

(1)  The  county  clerk  of  courts  shall,  upon  sentencing,  pretrial 
disposition  or  other  order,  transmit  to  the  prothonotary  certified 
copies of all judgments for restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines 
and  penalties  which,  in  the  aggregate,  exceed  $1,000,  and  it  shall 
be the duty of each prothonotary to enter and docket the same of 
record in his office and to index the same as judgments are indexed, 
without requiring the payment of costs as a condition precedent to 
the entry thereof.

(2)  The  clerk  of  courts,  in  consultation  with  other  appropriate 
governmental  agencies,  may  transmit  to  the  prothonotary  of  the 
respective county certified copies of all judgments for restitution, 
reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties which, in the aggregate, 
do not exceed $1,000, and, if so transmitted, it shall be the duty of 
each  prothonotary  to  enter  and  docket  the  same  of  record  in  his 
office  and  to  index  the  same  as  judgments  are  indexed,  without 
requiring the payment of costs as a condition precedent to the entry 
thereof.

(3)  The  county  clerk  of  courts  shall,  upon  sentencing,  pretrial 
disposition or other order, transmit to the Department of Probation 
of  the  respective  county  or  other  agent  designated  by  the  county 
commissioners  of  the  county  with  the  approval  of  the  president 
judge of the county and to the county correctional facility to which 
the offender has been sentenced or to the Department of Corrections, 
whichever  is  appropriate,  copies  of  all  orders  for  restitution  and 
amendments or alterations thereto, reparation, fees, costs, fines and 
penalties. This paragraph also applies in the case of costs imposed 
under section 9721(c.1)(relating to sentencing generally).

(4)  The  total  amount  for  which  the  person  is  liable  pursuant  to 
this section may be entered as a judgment upon the person or the 
property of the person sentenced or ordered, regardless of whether 
the amount has been ordered to be paid in installments.

(5) Deductions shall be as follows:

(i)  The  Department  of  Corrections  shall  make  monetary 
deductions of at least 25% of deposits made to inmate wages and 
personal accounts for the purpose of collecting restitution, costs 

34      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

imposed under section 9721(c.1), filing fees to be collected under 
section  6602(c)  (relating  to  prisoner  filing  fees)  and  any  other 
court-ordered obligation.

(ii) The county correctional facility to which the offender has been 
sentenced shall:

(A)  Be  authorized  to  make  monetary  deductions  from  inmate 
wages  and  personal  accounts  for  the  purpose  of  collecting 
restitution, costs imposed under section 9721(c.1), filing fees to 
be collected under section 6602(c) and any other court-ordered 
obligation or fees owed to the county jail or prison related to the 
inmate’s incarceration.

(B)  Deduct  an  amount  sufficient  to  satisfy  any  outstanding 
restitution,  costs  imposed  under  section  9721(c.1),  filing  fees 
to  be  collected  under  section  6602(c)  or  other  court-ordered 
obligations before releasing funds on deposit.

(iii) Any amount deducted under this paragraph shall be in addition 
to  the  full  amount  authorized  to  be  collected  pursuant  to  any 
order for support. Any amount deducted shall be transmitted to 
the probation department of the county or other agent designated 
by the county commissioners with the approval of the president 
judge of the county in which the offender was convicted.

(iv) The Department of Corrections and each county correctional 
facility  shall  develop  guidelines  relating  to  its  responsibilities 
under this paragraph. The guidelines shall  be incorporated into 
any contract entered into with a correctional facility.

(b.1) Restitution file.--

Upon receipt of each order from the clerk of 
courts as provided in subsection (b)(3), the department of probation 
of  the  respective  county  or  other  agent  designated  by  the  county 
commissioners of the county with the approval of the president judge 
of the county shall open a restitution file for the purposes of recording 
the amounts of restitution deducted by the Department of Corrections 
or  county  correctional  facility  or  collected  by  the  department  of 
probation or the agent designated by the county commissioners of the 
county with the approval of the president judge of the county.
(b.2) Mandatory payment of costs.--

Notwithstanding any provision 
of  law  to  the  contrary,  in  the  event  the  court  fails  to  issue  an  order 
under subsection (a) imposing costs upon the defendant, the defendant 
shall nevertheless be liable for costs, as provided in section 9721(c.1), 

35      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

unless  the  court  determines  otherwise  pursuant  to  Pa.R.Crim.P.  No. 
706(C) (relating to fines or costs). The absence of a court order shall 
not affect the applicability of the provisions of this section.
(c)  Period  of  time.--

Notwithstanding  section  6353  (relating  to 
limitation  on  and  change  in  place  of  commitment)  or  18  Pa.C.S.  § 
1106(c)(2) (relating to restitution for injuries to person or property), 
the period of time during which such judgments shall have full effect 
may exceed the maximum term of imprisonment to which the offender 
could have been sentenced for the crimes of which he was convicted 
or  the  maximum  term  of  confinement  to  which  the  offender  was 
committed.
(d) Priority.--

Notwithstanding any other statutory provisions in this 
or any other title, any lien obtained under this section shall maintain 
its priority indefinitely and no writ of revival need be filed.
(e) Preservation of assets subject to restitution.--

Upon application 
of  the  Commonwealth,  the  court  may  enter  a  restraining  order  or 
injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond 
or take any other action to preserve the availability of property which 
may be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution order under this 
section:

(1) upon the filing of a criminal complaint, information or indictment 
charging a criminal violation or a petition alleging delinquency for 
which  restitution  may  be  ordered  and  alleging  that  the  property 
with respect to which the order is sought appears to be necessary 
to satisfy such restitution order and judgment; and

(2) if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the 
property  and  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing,  the  court  determines 
that:

(i) there is a substantial probability that:

(A) the Commonwealth will prevail on the underlying criminal 
charges or allegation of delinquency;

(B) restitution will be ordered exceeding $10,000 in value;

(C)  the  property  appears  to  be  necessary  to  satisfy  such 
restitution order; and
(D) failure to enter the order will result in the property being 
destroyed,  removed  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  court  or 
otherwise  made  unavailable  for  payment  of  the  anticipated 

36      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

restitution order; and

(ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through 
the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any 
party against whom the order is to be entered.

(f)  Temporary  restraining  order.--

A 

temporary  restraining 
order  under  subsection  (e)  may  be  entered  upon  application  of 
the  Commonwealth  without  notice  or  opportunity  for  a  hearing, 
whether  or  not  a  complaint,  information,  indictment  or  petition 
alleging delinquency has been filed with respect to the property, if the 
Commonwealth demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe 
that the property with respect to which the order is sought appears 
to be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution order under this 
section and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of 
the  property  to  satisfy  such  restitution  order  and  judgment.  Such  a 
temporary order shall expire not more than ten days after the date on 
which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless 
the  party  against  whom  it  is  entered  consents  to  an  extension  for  a 
longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under 
this subsection shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to 
the expiration of the temporary order.
(g)  Costs,  etc.--

Any  sheriff’s  costs,  filing  fees  and  costs  of  the 
county  probation  department,  clerk  of  courts  or  other  appropriate 
governmental  agency,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  any  reasonable 
administrative  costs  associated  with  the  collection  of  restitution, 
transportation costs and other costs associated with the prosecution, 
shall be borne by the defendant and shall be collected by the county 
probation  department  or  other  appropriate  governmental  agency 
along  with  the  total  amount  of  the  judgment  and  remitted  to  the 
appropriate agencies at the time of or prior to satisfaction of judgment.
(g.1)  Payment.--

No  less  than  50%  of  all  moneys  collected  by  the 
county probation department or other agent designated by the county 
commissioners of the county with the approval of the president judge 
of  the  county  pursuant  to  subsection  (b)(1)  and  deducted  pursuant 
to  subsection  (b)(5)  shall,  until  the  satisfaction  of  the  defendant’s 
restitution  obligation,  be  used  to  pay  restitution  to  victims.  Any 
remaining moneys shall be used to pay fees, costs, fines, penalties and 
other court-ordered obligations.
(h)  Effect  on  contempt  proceedings.--

contempt proceedings mandated by 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(f).

This  section  shall  not  affect

VI. MODIFICATION

Commonwealth v. Lane

  When restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, the trial court possesses 
the statutory authority to modify the restitution condition “at any time.”  42 Pa.C.S.A. § 
9771(a) (“[t]he court has inherent power to at any time terminate continued supervision, 
lessen the conditions upon which an order of probation has been imposed or increase 
c.f. Commonwealth v. Dietrich,
the conditions under which an order of probation has been imposed upon a finding that a 
 
person presents an identifiable threat to public safety”); 
970  A.2d  1131,  1135  (Pa.  2009)  (“[t]he  plain  language  of  [18  Pa.C.S.A.]  §  1106(c)(3) 
provides courts with broad authority to modify restitution amounts at any time if the 
court  states  reasons  for  doing  so  as  a  matter  of  record.    18  Pa.C.S.  §  1106(c)(3).  .  .  .  
There is no statutory requirement the reasons for modification be undiscoverable at the 
time of sentencing.  Section 1106(c)(3)’s broad language indicates a legislative intent 
that courts have jurisdiction to modify restitution orders at any time without regard to

In  terms  of  the  procedure  regarding  modification  or  revocation  of  an  order  of 

 
probation, Section 9771(d) declares:

(d)  Hearing  required.--

There  shall  be  no  revocation  or  increase  of 
conditions  of  sentence  under  this  section  except  after  a  hearing  at 
which the court shall consider the record of the sentencing proceeding 
together  with  evidence  of  the  conduct  of  the  defendant  while  on 
probation. Probation may be eliminated or the term decreased without 
a hearing.

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9771(d).
VII. REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS - FAILURE TO PAY

 

  With  respect  to  the  revocation  of  probation,  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court 
summarized:

[42  Pa.C.S.A.  §]  9771  allows  for  termination  of  supervision  or 
modification of the conditions of probation at any time. [42 Pa.C.S.A.] 
§  9771(a).  Revocation  of  probation,  however,  is  sanctioned  only 
Id.
“upon proof of the violation of specified conditions of the probation.” 
  §  9771(b)[].    If,  after  finding  a  violation,  the  court  revokes  a 
defendant’s probation, it may only resentence the defendant to a term 
of  incarceration  if  (1)  the  defendant  was  convicted  of  a  new  crime; 
(2) the defendant’s conduct makes it likely that he or she will commit 
a  new  crime  if  not  incarcerated;  or  (3)  incarceration  “is  essential 
to  vindicate  the  authority  of  the  court.”   
  §  9771(c).  A  hearing  is 
required before a court may revoke probation or increase the terms of 
a defendant’s probation, “at which the court shall consider the record 
of the sentencing proceeding together with evidence of the conduct of 
the defendant while on probation.” 

 § 9771(d).

Id.

 i.e.

We find the language of the pertinent statutory provisions to be clear 
and unambiguous. The law provides a general condition of probation 
, that the defendant 
– that the defendant lead “a law-abiding life,”
refrain  from  committing  another  crime. 
  §  97[63](b).  To  [ensure] 
that  general  condition  is  met,  or  to  assist  the  defendant  in  meeting 
that  general  condition,  the  order  must  also  include  certain  “specific 
conditions” from the list enumerated in section 97[63(b)]. Only upon 
Id. 
the violation of any of the “specified conditions” in the probation order 
(general or specific) may a court revoke the defendant’s probation. 

40      Chapter 3      

Restitution as a Condition of Probation

§ 9771(b). In other words, a court may find a defendant in violation 
of  probation  only  if  the  defendant  has  violated  one  of  the  “specific 
conditions”  of  probation  included  in  the  probation  order  or  has 
committed  a  new  crime.  The  plain  language  of  the  statute  does  not 
allow for any other result.

revoke a defendant’s probation upon a finding that the defendant violated the “specific 
condition” of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9763(b)(10).  Nevertheless, as the United States Supreme 
Court has held:

10

in  revocation  proceedings  for  failure  to  pay  a  fine  or  restitution,  a 
sentencing court must inquire into the reasons for the failure to pay. If 
the probationer willfully refused to pay or failed to make sufficient bona 
fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to pay, the court may revoke 
probation  and  sentence  the  defendant  to  imprisonment  within  the 
authorized range of its sentencing authority.  If the probationer could 
not pay despite sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to 
do so, the court must consider alternate measures of punishment other 
than  imprisonment.  Only if alternate measures are not adequate to 
meet the State’s interests in punishment and deterrence may the court 
imprison a probationer who has made sufficient bona fide efforts to 
pay. To do otherwise would deprive the probationer of his conditional 
freedom simply because, through no fault of his own, he cannot pay 
the  fine.  Such  a  deprivation  would  be  contrary  to  the  fundamental 
fairness required by the Fourteenth Amendment.

9    As the Pennsylvania Superior Court has explained, following a probation revocation hearing, a trial court must engage in a two-pronged 
analysis.  First, the court must determine whether the facts warrant revocation. This step “involves a wholly retrospective factual question: 
whether the [ ] probationer has in fact acted in violation of one or more conditions of his parole or probation.”  Commonwealth v. Sims, 
770 A.2d 346, 349 (Pa. Super. 2001) (corrections omitted), quoting Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 784 (1973); see also 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 
9771(b) (“[t]he court may revoke an order of probation upon proof of the violation of specified conditions of the probation”).  “Only if it 
is determined that the [] probationer did violate the conditions does the second question arise: should the [] probationer be recommitted 
to prison or should other steps be taken to protect society and improve chances of rehabilitation?” Sims, 770 A.2d at 349 (corrections

10  We note that, in Commonwealth v. Hall, 80 A.3d 1204 (Pa. 2013), the Supreme Court declared that the “catchall” provision of 42 Pa.C.S.A. 
§ 9763(b) “is written in broader terms” than Section 9763(b)(10).  The Hall Court stated that the catchall “provision authorizes imposi-
tion of ‘any’ other conditions of probation reasonably related to the defendant’s rehabilitation, so long as they are not ‘unduly restrictive’ 
of the defendant’s constitutional liberty or conscience.  This subsection neither approves nor excludes monetary obligations and is not 
oriented towards the past in the same manner as the terms in subsection [(b)(10)].”  Hall, 80 A.3d at 1213.

1.  This foundation of the Juvenile Act is rooted in the philosophy of “restorative 
justice,”  which  gives  priority  to  repairing  the  harm  done  to  crime  victims  and 
communities,  and  which  defines  offender  accountability  in  terms  of  assuming 
responsibility and taking action to repair harm. The “balanced attention” mandates 
in the Juvenile Act provide the framework for implementing restorative justice in 
Pennsylvania’s juvenile justice system.

2.  Also at the foundation of this mandate is the concept that crime victims and 
the community, as well as juvenile offenders, should receive balanced attention and 
gain  tangible  benefits  from  their  interactions  with  Pennsylvania’s  juvenile  justice 
system.
B.  Basic Principles of Restitution in the Juvenile Act

1.  The Juvenile Act authorizes a judge who adjudicates a child delinquent to 
, probation, commitment to 

enter an order of disposition, which includes, 
an institution for delinquent juveniles, and restitution. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a).

inter alia

Id.

.  The disposition of the child shall be consistent with “the protection of the 
public interest and best suited to the child’s treatment, supervision, rehabilitation 
and welfare.” 

 

3.  The disposition shall also be “appropriate to the individual circumstances of 
the child’s case” and “provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, 
the imposition of accountability for the offenses committed, and the development of 
competencies to enable the child to become a responsible and productive member 
of the community.” 

Id.

4.  When considering whether to order that the child pay “reasonable amounts 
of  money  as  fines,  costs,  fees  or  restitution,”  the  court  should  also  consider  “the 
nature of the acts that the child committed and the earning capacity of the child.” 42 
Pa.C.S. § 6352(a)(5).

Restitution in Juvenile Court

I.  RESTITUTION IN JUVENILE COURT

A.  Foundational Principles of the Juvenile Act

Restitution in Juvenile Court

juvenile court has jurisdiction over the juvenile. The juvenile court, however, may 
consider  the  child’s  earning  capacity  over  a  longer  period  of  time  if  the  juvenile 
court believes that considering a longer period of time will better meet the goals of 
the Juvenile Act.
C.   Statutory Basis for Imposing Restitution

  

1.      The  legislature  amended  the  Juvenile  Act  to  include  Section  6352(a)(5) 
that authorizes the juvenile court to impose “fines, costs or restitution as deemed 
In the 
appropriate as part of the plan of rehabilitation considering the nature of the acts 
Interest of Steven J.
committed and the earning capacity of the child.” 42 Pa.C.S.  § 6352(a)(5); 
, 491 A.2d 125, 128 (Pa. Super. 1985).

.    Pennsylvania  Juvenile  Court  Procedural  Rules  provide  that  if  the  juvenile 

court orders restitution in its dispositional order, the order shall include:

●
●
●

  2

  A specific amount of restitution to be paid by the juvenile;
  To whom the restitution shall be paid; and
  A payment schedule, if so determined by the court.

Pa.R.J.C.P. 515(B).
 

D.  Policy Considerations in Ordering Restitution

The  juvenile  court  should  consider  the  restorative  justice  aspect  of  ordering 
 
restitution  so  that  the  order  is  consistent  with  the  protection  of  the  public  interest 
and the community. The rehabilitative purpose of the Juvenile Act is attained through 
In  the 
accountability and the development of personal qualities that will enable the juvenile 
Interest of M.W
offender  to  become  a  responsible  and  productive  member  of  the  community. 
II.  FACTORS IN DETERMINING RESTITUTION AMOUNT

., 725 A.2d 729, 733 (Pa. 1999).

A.  Juvenile Court’s Broad Discretion in Determining Restitution

 

1.  The policies underlying the Juvenile Act and its restitution provision, as well 
as the plain language of Section 6352, grant the juvenile court a broad measure of 
discretion  to  apportion  responsibility  for  damages  based  upon  the  nature  of  the 
, 555 
delinquent act and the earning capacity of the juvenile. 
Pa. 505, 725 A.2d 729 (1999).

In the Interest of M.W.

current

2.  When considering the “earning capacity of the child,” the best practice is to 
consider the child’s 
 earning capacity; i.e., the child’s earning capacity while 
juvenile court has jurisdiction over the juvenile. The juvenile court, however, may 
consider  the  child’s  earning  capacity  over  a  longer  period  of  time  if  the  juvenile

Restitution in Juvenile Court

court believes that considering a longer period of time will better meet the goals of 
the Juvenile Act.

B.D.G.

3.  Even if a victim settles with another party in a civil suit that arose out of 
, 959 
 

juvenile’s delinquent act, the juvenile court may still impose restitution. 
A.2d at 371.
B.  Factors Juvenile Court Should Consider in Ordering Restitution  
     (“Dublinski Factors”)

 

Generally

  1.  

The juvenile court must consider four factors before imposing restitution:

 The amount of loss the victim suffered;

 The fact that the juvenile’s action caused the injury;

 The amount awarded does not exceed the juvenile’s ability to pay; and

 The type of payment that will best serve the needs of the victim and the          

    capabilities of the juvenile.

In the Interest of Dublinski

 

Dublinski Factor No. 1: Amount of Loss Suffered by the Victim

, 695 A.2d 827 (Pa.Super. 1997).

  An  order  of  restitution  is  not  an  order  of  damages.  While  the  juvenile’s 
payment of restitution may aid the victim, its true purpose and the reason 
for its imposition is the rehabilitative goal it serves by impressing upon the 
juvenile the loss he has caused and his responsibility to repair the loss to 
the extent that he is able to do so. 
, 959 A.2d 362, 
371 (Pa.Super. 2008)(

Commonwealth v. B.D.G.

)(citation omitted).

en banc

 

B.D.G.

In determining the amount of restitution, the juvenile court, in its discretion, 
may ignore insurance proceeds that a victim’s insurance company paid the 
victim  as  a  result  of  the  loss  the  juvenile  caused  the  victim.  The  juvenile 
court, however, may only do so if the juvenile court believes that ignoring 
the  amount  of  insurance  proceeds  furthers  the  goal  of  rehabilitating  the 
juvenile. 
,  444  A.2d  758, 
760 (Pa. Super. 1982).

“earning capacity.” 

 419 A.2d 1224,1227 (Pa. Super. 1980).

  The  juvenile  court  should  evaluate  relevant  factors,  such  as,  juvenile’s 
mental ability, maturity and education, work history, if any, the likelihood 
of  future  employment  and  the  extent  to  which  a  juvenile  can  reasonably 
meet  a  restitution  obligation,  the  impact  that  the  restitution  award  will 
have on the juvenile’s ability to acquire higher education and thus increase 
the  juvenile’s  earning  capacity,  and  the  juvenile’s  present  ability  to  make 
restitution.

  When  considering  the  “earning  capacity  of  the  child,”  the  best  practice  is 
to  consider  the  child’s 
  earning  capacity;  i.e.,  the  child’s  earning 
capacity while juvenile court has jurisdiction over the juvenile. The juvenile 
court,  however,  may  consider  the  child’s  earning  capacity  over  a  longer

may  defer  imposition  of  a  payment  plan  until  an  appropriate  time  in  the 
future.

  When  considering  the  “earning  capacity  of  the  child,”  the  best  practice  is 
  earning  capacity;  i.e.,  the  child’s  earning 
to  consider  the  child’s 
capacity while juvenile court has jurisdiction over the juvenile. The juvenile 
court,  however,  may  consider  the  child’s  earning  capacity  over  a  longer 
period of time if the juvenile court believes that considering a longer period 
of time will better meet the goals of the Juvenile Act.
An Award of Restitution is Not an Award of Damages

1.   An order of restitution is not an award of damages. While a juvenile’s payment 
of  restitution  may  aid  the  victim,  its  true  purpose  and  the  reason  for  its 
imposition is the rehabilitative goal it serves by impressing upon the juvenile 

6      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

the loss he has caused and his responsibility to repair the loss to the extent 
that he is able to do so.  

, 959 A.2d at 371 (citation omitted).

B.D.G.

2.    For  example,  juvenile  recklessly  drove  a  car  that  resulted  in  the  death  of 
one  victim  and  severe  injuries  to  two  other  victims.  Superior  Court  found 
that it was in the discretion of the juvenile court to impose restitution as a 
rehabilitative goal. It is irrelevant that the insurance company of the juvenile’s 
parents made a monetary payment to the injured victim seeking restitution 
or that the injured victim signed a release upon settlement with the insurance 
company. 

 868 A.2d 1203, 1205-06 (Pa. Super. 1997).

Facts in the Record to Support an Order of Restitution

Appeal of B.T.C.,

Dublinski

The order of restitution must be supported by the record and not be excessive 
or speculative. 
Impact  of  Criminal  Statutes  and  Cases  Regarding  Restitution  on  the 
Interpretation of Juvenile Cases and Statutes

, 695 A.2d at 829.

D. 
 

E. 

1.  Criminal statutes are not controlling on an interpretation of Juvenile Act, 42 
Pa.C.S. § 6352. Similarly, cases interpreting such statutes are not binding on 
the  juvenile  court.    The  juvenile  court,  however,  may  rely  on  criminal  law 
jurisprudence when those principles are consistent with the purposes of the 
Juvenile Act. 

B.D.G.

, 959 A.2d at 367.
Dublinski,

●

  For example, in 

 695 A.2d at 830, the Superior Court found that 
the principles about the scope of restitution enunciated in an adult criminal 
case aligned with purposes of Juvenile Act and adopted the “but for” test to 
determine the scope of a juvenile’s restitution.

Dublinski

●

 

In contrast, in 
, the Superior Court refused to adopt the requirement 
set  forth  in  18  Pa.C.S.  §  1106  because  this  provision  is  contrary  to  the 
Juvenile Act. Section 1106, which applies to an adult offender, provides that 
the trial court, when determining restitution, should not consider the adult 
offender’s ability to pay. In contrast, 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352 requires the juvenile 
court to consider the juvenile’s ability to pay. 

 695 A.2d at 830. 

Dublinski,

III.  DISPOSITIONAL COURT’S RESPONSIBILITIES

A.    Restitution Hearing

 

1.   Before entering an order imposing restitution, a juvenile court should hold 
a hearing to ensure that the amount of restitution is not speculative, reflects 
the amount of loss the victim suffered, the juvenile’s actions in causing the 
injury, the juvenile’s earning capacity, and that the payment will best serve 
the needs of the victim and the capabilities of the juvenile.

7      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

current

2.  When considering the “earning capacity of the child,” the best practice is to 
consider the child’s 
 earning capacity; i.e., the child’s earning capacity 
while  juvenile  court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  juvenile.  The  juvenile  court, 
however, may consider the child’s earning capacity over a longer period of 
time if the juvenile court believes that considering a longer period of time will 
better meet the goals of the Juvenile Act.  

3.   After the hearing, the court shall state on the record the amount of restitution 

and the basis for its decision. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(c).

4.   If  a  victim  submits  a  written  or  oral  impact  statement  that  addresses  the 
economic, physical or psychological effect that the crime had on the victim, the 
juvenile court shall consider the statement when determining the disposition 
of the juvenile, including the imposition of restitution. 28 P.S. 11.201(5).

B.  Restitution Order

Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Juvenile  Court  Procedure  515  requires  that  the  court 
include the following information in an order for restitution:

  1.  A specific amount of restitution that the juvenile is to pay;
  2.  To whom the restitution shall be paid; and
  3.  A payment schedule, if so determined by the court.

Pa.R.J.C.P. 515(B).
C.    Parties To Whom Juvenile May Pay Restitution

 

 
 
 

 

   

 
 

 

 

1.  Juvenile Court may order that the juvenile pay restitution to the victim or a 

third-party, such as an insurance company, or the State.

2.   It  is  within  the  discretion  of  the  juvenile  court,  when  it  determines  that  a 
victim  or  other  party  is  entitled  to  restitution  funds,  whether  it  should  be 
paid  sooner  than  the  time  period  in  which  the  juvenile  will  be  able  to  pay 
restitution, and may order that the juvenile pay restitution to the restitution 
fund.  42  Pa.C.S.  §  6352(a)(5).  In  such  case,  the  President  Judge  of  a  Court 
of  Common  Pleas,  in  his  or  her  discretion,  may  make  payments  from  the 
restitution fund to a victim or other party for financial losses resulting from 
delinquent acts.  

Id.

3.   It is within the discretion of the juvenile court to order that the juvenile pay 
restitution to an insurance company that reimburses an insurance company 
for amounts that the insurance company paid the victim. 
, 45 A.3d 
1118 (Pa. Super. 2012).  It is also within the discretion of the juvenile court 

In re: J.G.

8      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

In re: B.T.C.

to  order  the  juvenile  to  pay  restitution  to  a  victim  even  if  the  payment  is 
duplicative. 

, 868 A.2d 1203 (Pa. Super. 2005).

4.   It  is  also  within  the  discretion  of  the  juvenile  court  to  order  as  restitution 
that  the  juvenile  reimburse  the  state  for  the  investigation  that  led  to  the 
adjudication of delinquency of the juvenile. In re 
, 847 A.2d 685 (Pa. Super. 
2004).
D.  Timeliness and Deferment of Restitution Order

R.S.

In  the 
1.   The Juvenile Act, unlike the Crimes Code, does not require the juvenile court 

Interest of J.G.
to  impose  restitution  within  thirty  days  of  the  dispositional  order. 

, 45 A.3d 1118, 1121 (Pa. Super. 2012). Rather, the Juvenile Act 
provides the juvenile court with broad discretion in ordering that the juvenile 
pay restitution to the victim. This discretion includes determining the time 
period during the proceedings in which the juvenile court orders restitution. 
It  was  proper  for  the  juvenile  court  to  wait  to  order  restitution  until  the 
information regarding the damages became available, even if it took 114 days 
 at 1122. However, a court may not impose an 
to obtain the information. 
See also Commonwealth v. Ramos,
open-ended order of restitution with the amount to be determined at a later 
 197 
date. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a)(5) and (6). 
A.3d 766, 770 (Pa.Super. 2018). 

Id.

2.   Juvenile court did not violate a juvenile’s due process rights when the juvenile 
court imposed restitution more than ninety days after final disposition and

Super. 2005) (providing that an order modifying restitution is an appealable 
order)).

, 45 A.2d at 1122 (citing 

In re: J.E.D.

3.    If  the  juvenile court enters an  order for  restitution  and the  juvenile cannot 
pay the restitution at the time of the order, the juvenile court may defer the 
juvenile’s restitution obligation or order that juvenile pay the restitution over 
a period of time. 

, 959 A.2d at 371.

E.   Restitution as Part of Probation Order

B.D.G.

 

 

1.   Section 6352(a)(2) authorizes a juvenile court to, inter alia, place a juvenile 
under the supervision of the probation officer of the court “under conditions 
and limitations the court prescribes.” Although this section does not specifically 
list  restitution  as  one  of  the  conditions  of  probation,  it  is  reasonable  to 
interpret this provision as permitting the juvenile court to impose restitution 
as a condition of probation so long as the juvenile’s payment of restitution is 
consistent with the policy of the Juvenile Act.  
, 725 A.2d 729, 
732 (Pa. 1999).

See In re M.W.

9      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

2.   When  a  trial  court,  in  an  adult  proceeding,  imposes  restitution  as  part  of 
the sentence, rather than as a condition of probation, the courts have found 
different legal implications. See generally 
 844 A.2d 
13, 19 (Pa. Super. 2004). The juvenile courts have not made such a distinction.

Commonwealth v. Popow,

3.   The  goals  and  purposes  of  restitution  in  the  juvenile  context  are  the  same 
for disposition orders and probation orders. A juvenile court should always 
impose restitution that is “appropriate to the individual circumstances of the 
child’s case” in light of “the nature of the acts that the child committed and the 
earning capacity of the child.”  42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a). 
F.   Determination of Restitution For Intercounty Transfers

 

 
When  a  juvenile  commits  an  offense  in  a  county  that  is  not  his  home 
county and the juvenile judge in the county in which he committed the offense 
makes findings of facts about the offense, the juvenile judge should also make a 
finding about the amount of restitution.
G.  Retention of Jurisdiction Until Age 21 and Then Judgment Against Juvenile

 

The  Juvenile  Act  provides  that  a  court  that  orders  restitution  retains 
 
jurisdiction until there is full compliance with the order or until the juvenile 
is 21 years old. If a restitution order remains unpaid when the child turns 21, 
any remainder continues to be collectible as a judgment in favor of the county 
probation department under Section 9728. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a)(5).

1.      

 
A court may impose restitution as a term of a consent decree voluntarily 
entered by the juvenile. The juvenile court, in either approving or setting the 
amount of restitution, must consider the juvenile’s ability to pay.

Informal Adjustment 

In re J.J.

 
When making an informal adjustment to allegations under Juvenile Court 
Procedural  Rule  312,  a  probation  officer  may  include  as  a  condition  of  the 
adjustment a payment of restitution to which the parties agreed. Pa.R.J.C.P. 312.

causing the injury, the juvenile’s ability to pay the restitution award and that 
the payment will best serve the needs of the victim and the capabilities of the 
juvenile.  

Juvenile Court’s Discretion to Hold a Hearing

Juvenile court has the discretion to hold a hearing before accepting the terms 
of a consent decree, informal adjustment or plea agreement that includes 
the  payment  of  restitution.  Juvenile  court  should  ensure  that  the  amount 
of restitution is not speculative,  reflects amount of loss the victim suffered, 
the juvenile’s actions in causing the injury, the juvenile’s earning and that 
the payment will best serve the needs of the victim and the capabilities of 
the juvenile.

current 

  When  considering  the  “earning  capacity  of  the  child,”  the  best  practice  is 
to  consider  the  child’s 
earning  capacity;  i.e.  the  child’s  earning 
capacity while juvenile court has jurisdiction over the juvenile. The juvenile 
court,  however,  may  consider  the  child’s  earning  capacity  over  a  longer 
period of time if the juvenile court believes that considering a longer period 
of time will better meet the goals of the Juvenile Act.  
Victim Offender Conferencing

  Another method to determine restitution is to have the victim and juvenile 
engage in Victim/Offender Conferencing. This involves a facilitated dialogue 
between the victim and the juvenile offender. Victim/offender conferencing 
encourages  offenders  to  take  responsibility  for  their  actions,  understand 
the harm he caused and take action to make things right.

  Victim Offenders Conferencing is primarily about the restoration of crime 
victims. The research has shown that the use of VOC enhances the ability to 
collect restitution and empowers the victim to express their needs and wants 
regarding the repair of harm to them. While this practice has meaningful 
restorative justice value, it must be implemented carefully, primarily as a 
service to victims. It should only be an element of an appropriate disposition 
of a case, not the entire disposition of a case.

IV.  Parental Participation and Liability

A.   Parental Participation in Juvenile’s Restitution Obligation

 

      

may
Section 6310 of the Juvenile Act, “Parental Participation,” provides that a 
 
 order a parent to participate in restitution. Parental “participation” 
court 
in a juvenile’s restitution order should be limited to attending the restitution 
hearing,  helping  the  juvenile  find  employment,  arranging  transportation  to 
employment,  overseeing  the  juvenile’s  income,  or  ensuring  that  the  juvenile

remits  the  required  payments.

B.   Liability of Parents for Juvenile’s Delinquent Acts that are Tortious.

  7  A.3d  891,  896-97  (Pa.  Cmwlth. 

 

 

 
Liability for Tortious Acts of Children, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5501-5509 imposes 
liability on a parent if a court adjudicates a juvenile delinquent for committing 
a tortious act that caused an injury. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5502; 23 Pa.C.S. § 5505. The 
parent  is  only  liable  for  damages  up  to  $1000  for  one  victim  or  $2500  for 
multiple victims
●

 

In  a  juvenile  proceeding,  the  juvenile  court  shall  ascertain  the  amount  to 
reimburse any person who has suffered injury because of the delinquent 
and tortious act of the child and direct the parents to make a payment not 
to  exceed  $1000  for  one  victim  or  $2500  for  multiple  victims.  23  Pa.C.S. 
§§ 5503(a), 5505. If the parent fails to make the payment, the victim may 
recover the amount in a civil suit against the parent or parents. 23 Pa.C.S. § 
5503(b).

  The limitations of $1000 for one victim and $2500 for multiple victims also 
apply when two or more children of the parent engaged jointly in one or 
more delinquent and tortious acts. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5505(c).

  A parent shall not be liable for the delinquent and tortious act of his child 
if at the time the child committed the act, the parent “has neither custody 
nor  is  entitled  to  custody  of  the  child”  or  if  the  child  is  institutionalized 
or  emancipated.  23  Pa.C.S.  §  5508(a).  A  parent  is  still  liable  if  the  parent 
deserted the child. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5508(b).

  This Act only applies to “natural or adoptive” parents and does not apply to 
a Child and Youth Agency who had custody over the child at the time that 
,  7  A.3d 
the  child  committed  the  delinquent  and  tortious  acts.

.  Restitution Fund

A. Contribution.

 

 

 
In  addition  to  authorizing  the  payment  of  restitution  to  a  victim,  the 
Juvenile Court may order that the juvenile contribute to a “restitution fund” the 
President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of each county may create.  23 
Pa.C.S.  §6352(a)(5).  Under  the  JCJC  Standards  Governing  the  Administration 
of Restitution Funds, any court that collects such contributions from juveniles 
must  establish  a  fund  for  the  deposit  of  the  contributions.  An  established 
restitution fund will pay the victim before the time that the juvenile pays the 
fund.  

12      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

B.  Guidelines

 

 

 

 

 

 
When  establishing  such  a  fund,  the  President  Judge  of  the  Court  of 
Common  Pleas  should  promulgate  written  guidelines  for  its  administration. 
The guidelines should specify that no disbursements from the fund may occur 
without  the  signature  of  two  persons  designated  by  the  President  Judge. 
Disbursements from the fund shall be at the discretion of the President Judge, 
adhere to the written guidelines, and remain within the limitations of Chapter 
63 of Title 42.  42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a). Restitution funds should be audited annually, 
and an annual report must disclose individual and aggregate data on payments 
to and disbursement from the fund.

C.   Judgment for Unpaid Restitution

Under the JCJC Standards Governing the Collection and Disbursement of 
 
Restitution, each county must adopt a written policy requiring that the juvenile 
court  enter  a  judgment  for  any  unpaid  restitution  when  the  juvenile  court’s 
jurisdiction  over  the  juvenile  terminates.  At  least  one-half  of  any  amount 
collected under such a judgment must be applied to the payment of restitution 
to the victim, as opposed to fees, costs, fines, and other obligations. 42 Pa.C.S. § 
9728(g.1). As a matter of best practices, however, all funds collected should be 
applied to the restitution obligation until it is fully satisfied. 

VI.  COLLECTION OF RESTITUTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF ORDER

A.  Probation Department

The  county  probation  department  (or  other  agent  designated  by  the 
 
county commissioners with the approval of the president judge) shall collect 
restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9728(a). 

B.  Procedure for Collection of Restitution Order

1.  Upon sentencing, pretrial disposition or other order, the county clerk of courts 
shall transmit copies of all orders for restitution. 42 Pa.C.S. §9728(b)(3).

2.  The county probation department or designated agent, upon receipt of each 
order  from  the  clerk  of  courts,  will  open  a  restitution  file  for  the  purposes 
of recording the amounts of restitution received, collected, or deducted. 42 
Pa.C.S. § 9728(b.1).

C.   Default in Payment

1.  If a juvenile fails to make restitution payments, it is the best practice of juvenile 
court to conduct a hearing to determine the reasons for the juvenile’s failure 

13      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

to pay and take action consistent with the Juvenile Act.

2.  If  the  juvenile  court  finds  that  it  is  necessary  and  appropriate  to  refer  the 
juvenile’s delinquent account to a private collection agency, the juvenile court 
may do so. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9730.

not

3.  If the juvenile court determines that the juvenile is 

 able to pay, it should 
assess the extent of that inability, the burden that payment imposes on the 
juvenile, and adjust the payment schedule or sentence the juvenile to a period 
of  community  service—whatever  the  court  finds  to  be  just  and  practicable 
under the circumstances. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352.

D.   Judgment May Be Entered

 

 

If  it  is  appropriate  to  enter  a  judgment  for  the  juvenile’s  failure  to  pay 
 
restitution,  the  judgment  shall  be  against  the  juvenile  and  in  favor  of  the 
probation department. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9728(a).

 
JUVENILE COURT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF RESTITUTION, FEES AND  

VII.   PROPOSED AMENDMENT OF Pa.R.J.C.P. 515 AND 610 TO PERMIT THE  
 
 

 
  COSTS. 

 
The Juvenile Court Procedural Rules Committee has proposed a comment 
to Pennsylvania Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure Section 515 (Dispositional 
Order) and 610 (Dispositional and Commitment review) making explicit that 
a  juvenile  may  petition  the  juvenile  court  to  reduce  his  obligations  to  pay 
restitution, fees and costs.

 
If  the  juvenile  court  modified  a  juvenile’s  obligation  to  pay  restitution, 
fees,  and  costs  and  the  juvenile  was  otherwise  compliant,  the  juvenile  court 
would have the discretion to decide that supervision is no longer necessary and 
to terminate supervision.

VIII.  APPELLATE REVIEW

A.   Standard of Review

1.  “The Juvenile Act grants broad discretion to the juvenile court to determine 
an appropriate disposition. The appellate court will not disturb a disposition 
absent  a  manifest  abuse  of  discretion.”   
,  45  A.3d  1118,  1120  (Pa. 
Super. 2012) (citation omitted). 

In  re  J.G.

2.    The  appellate  courts  review  whether  the  disposition  is  consistent  with  the 
protection  of  the  public  interest  and  the  community,  and  the  rehabilitative 
purpose of the Juvenile Act. The purpose of the disposition order is to ensure 

14      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

accountability  and  the  development  of  personal  qualities  that  will  enable 
the juvenile offender to become a responsible and productive member of the 
community.  Thus  the  policies  underlying  the  Juvenile  Act  and  its  restitution 
provision,  as  well  as  the  plain  language  of  Section  6352,  serve  to  invest  the 
juvenile court with a broad measure of discretion to apportion responsibility 
for  damages  based  upon  the  nature  of  the  delinquent  act  and  the  earning 
capacity of the juvenile.

B.   Abuse of Discretion

C.   Claims Waived on Appeal

, 959 A.2d at 367. 

 

 

 
When a juvenile failed to object before the juvenile court to a restitution 
order  that  required  him  to  pay  for  funeral  expenses,  the  juvenile  waived  his 
challenge on appeal that the juvenile court erred in not considering the nature 
of the delinquent act or his earning capacity.

Super. 2005).
  BEST PRACTICES AND CONSIDERATIONS WHEN ORDERING RESTITUTION  
 

IN JUVENILE CASES

In re B.T.C.

IX. 
 

1.  The juvenile court, when determining an amount of restitution, should set an 

amount that reflects:
●

 

 
 
 
 
 

●
●
●
●
●

●

the  current  earning  capacity  of  the  juvenile,  including  employment 
opportunities;
the harm the juvenile caused the victim, 
the culpability of the juvenile in causing the harm, 
the impact that restitution will have on rehabilitating the juvenile,
the juvenile’s age, 
the length of time that the juvenile might be under supervision in order to 
complete all other conditions of the disposition order, and

  any other relevant factors.

2.  The  juvenile  court  must  place  on  the  record  the  basis  for  the  amount  of 

15      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

restitution  ordered.  If  the  amount  of  claimed  restitution  is  in  question,  the 
court should conduct a hearing to determine the actual amount. 

3.  The juvenile court should ensure that the victim is notified and provided with 
an opportunity to be heard at dispositional and dispositional review hearings, 
especially when the juvenile court determines the amount of restitution or 
the juvenile files a motion to modify restitution. 

4.  Before setting an amount of restitution, the juvenile court must review proof 
of the victim’s damages to establish the amount requested (i.e., victim claims 
forms,  receipts,  appraisals,  estimates,  etc.).  The  amount  of  restitution  may 
not be speculative.

5.  The juvenile court is not required to set restitution at the full amount of the 
victim’s  damages.  Rather,  the  juvenile  court  should  consider  this  factor  as 
well as the factors listed above.

6.  If the juvenile court determines that it is not in the best interest of the juvenile 
to  order  that  the  juvenile  pay  restitution  in  the  full  amount  of  the  victim’s 
damages, it is appropriate for the juvenile court to ask the victim about the 
victim’s position on an alternative disposition as a means to repair harm in 
lieu  of  restitution,  such  as  community  service,  that  is  consistent  with  the 
mission of balanced and restorative justice.

7.  When more than one juvenile has committed the delinquent act(s) and the 
juvenile court determines that it is appropriate to impose restitution on each of 
the juveniles, the juvenile court should separately determine the appropriate 
amount of restitution for each juvenile. The juvenile court should not require 
one juvenile to be responsible for paying the amount of restitution that the 
juvenile court orders for the other juvenile.

8.  When considering the juvenile’s current ability to pay restitution, the juvenile 
court should not consider the financial resources of the juvenile’s parents or 
guardians.

9.  It is the responsibility of the juvenile court and the probation department to 
create  and  provide  work  and  community  service  programs  and  restitution 
funds to assist juveniles with paying restitution.

10. The juvenile court should order that the juvenile make restitution payments 
in installments if the juvenile is unable to pay the full amount at one time. 

11. If the juvenile fails to make one or more restitution payments, the juvenile 
court,  when  deciding  whether  to  impose  additional  sanctions  against  the 
juvenile, should consider the juvenile’s current earning capacity, the juvenile’s 

16      Chapter 4      

Restitution in Juvenile Court

current behavior and rehabilitative needs.

12. When appropriate, the court should encourage victims to apply to the Crime 
Victims’  Compensation  Fund  for  recovery  of  financial  loss,  as  permitted  by 
the Fund, especially in cases where the amount of restitution sought is high 
or when the court has found that a juvenile is unable to pay any or all of the 
restitution.

13. Juveniles should not make payments directly to the victim. Rather, the juvenile 
should  make  the  payments  to  the  probation  department  or  juvenile  court 
who will in turn properly disburse the funds. 

14. The juvenile court should require the juvenile to pay restitution for the period 
of  time  that  is  appropriate  for  juvenile  and  meets  the  goals  of  the  Juvenile 
Act.  In other words, the juvenile court should not automatically require the 
juvenile  to  pay  restitution  until  the  juvenile  turns  21  years  old;  rather,  the 
juvenile court should require the juvenile to pay restitution for the period of 
time that the juvenile court determines is appropriate under the Juvenile Act 
and is in line with other conditions of supervision.

15. The court should review the juvenile’s progress towards making restitution 
payments  at  each  dispositional  review  hearing.  The  juvenile  court  should 
also consider whether it is in a juvenile’s best interest for the case to remain 
open until the age of 21 when the juvenile has otherwise satisfied all other 
obligations of the dispositional order.  The juvenile court should consider the 
negative impact on a juvenile’s transition to adulthood when a juvenile has a 
judgment entered against him for failing to pay restitution while under the 
jurisdiction of the juvenile court.

I.   ENABLING STATUTES and RULES

RESTITUTION IN GENERAL (Crimes Code)

18 Pa.C.S.A. § 1106
Restitution for injuries to person or property

(a) General rule.

(b) Condition of probation or parole.

--Upon conviction for any crime wherein property has been stolen, 
 
converted  or  otherwise  unlawfully  obtained,  or  its  value  substantially  decreased  as 
a  direct  result  of  the  crime,  or  wherein  the  victim  suffered  personal  injury  directly 
resulting from the crime, the offender shall be sentenced to make restitution in addition 
to the punishment prescribed therefor.
 
--Whenever restitution has been ordered 
pursuant to subsection (a) and the offender has been placed on probation or parole, 
 
his compliance with such order may be made a condition of such probation or parole.

(c) Mandatory restitution.--

 

(1) The court shall order full restitution:

(i)  Regardless  of  the  current  financial  resources  of  the  defendant,  so  as  to 
provide the victim with the fullest compensation for the loss. The court shall 
not  reduce  a  restitution  award  by  any  amount  that  the  victim  has  received 
from the Crime Victim’s Compensation Board or other governmental agency 
but shall order the defendant to pay any restitution ordered for loss previously 
compensated by the board to the Crime Victim’s Compensation Fund or other 
designated account when the claim involves a government agency in addition 
to  or  in  place  of  the  board.  The  court  shall  not  reduce  a  restitution  award 
by any amount that the victim has received from an insurance company but 
shall  order  the  defendant  to  pay  any  restitution  ordered  for  loss  previously 
compensated by an insurance company to the insurance company.
(ii) If restitution to more than one person is set at the same time, the court 
shall  set  priorities  of  payment.  However,  when  establishing  priorities,  the 
court shall order payment in the following order:

 
 
 
 
 
 

(A) The victim.
 
(B) The Crime Victim’s Compensation Board.
 
(C) Any other government agency which has provided reimbursement   
 
       to the victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct.
 
(D) Any insurance company which has provided reimbursement to the  
 
 
       victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct.
(2) At the time of sentencing the court shall specify the amount and method of 
restitution. In determining the amount and method of restitution, the court:

2      Chapter 5     

Statutory Provisions and Rules of Court

(i)  Shall  consider  the  extent  of  injury  suffered  by  the  victim,  the  victim’s 
request for restitution as presented to the district attorney in accordance with 
paragraph (4) and such other matters as it deems appropriate.
(ii) May order restitution in a lump sum, by monthly installments or according 
to such other schedule as it deems just.
(iii) Shall not order incarceration of a defendant for failure to pay restitution if 
the failure results from the offender’s inability to pay.
(iv)  Shall  consider  any  other  preexisting  orders  imposed  on  the  defendant, 
including, but not limited to, orders imposed under this title or any other title.
(3) The court may, at any time or upon the recommendation of the district attorney 
that is based on information received from the victim and the probation section of 
the county or other agent designated by the county commissioners of the county 
with the approval of the president judge to collect restitution, alter or amend any 
order of restitution made pursuant to paragraph (2), provided, however, that the 
court states its reasons and conclusions as a matter of record for any change or 
amendment to any previous order.
(4)  (i)  It  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  the  district  attorneys  of  the  respective 
counties  to  make  a  recommendation  to  the  court  at  or  prior  to  the  time  of 
sentencing as to the amount of restitution to be ordered. This recommendation 
shall be based upon information solicited by the district attorney and received 
from the victim.
(ii)  Where  the  district  attorney  has  solicited  information  from  the  victims 
as  provided  in  subparagraph  (i)  and  has  received  no  response,  the  district 
attorney shall, based on other available information, make a recommendation 
to the court for restitution.
(iii) The district attorney may, as appropriate, recommend to the court that the 
restitution order be altered or amended as provided in paragraph (3).

(d) Limitations on district justices.--

(e)  Restitution  payments  and  records.--

Restitution ordered by a magisterial district 
 
judge  shall  be  limited  to  the  return  of  the  actual  property  or  its  undisputed  dollar 
amount or, where the claim for restitution does not exceed the civil jurisdictional limit 
specified  in  42  Pa.C.S.  §  1515(a)(3)  (relating  to  jurisdiction)  and  is  disputed  as  to 
amount, the magisterial district judge shall determine and order the dollar amount of 
restitution to be made.
 
Restitution,  when  ordered  by  a  judge, 
shall  be  made  by  the  offender  to  the  probation  section  of  the  county  in  which  he 
was convicted or to another agent designated by the county commissioners with the 
approval  of the  president judge  of the county to collect  restitution according to  the 
order of the court or, when ordered by a magisterial district judge, shall be made to 
the magisterial district judge. The probation section or other agent designated by the 
county commissioners of the county with the approval of the president judge to collect 
restitution and the magisterial district judge shall maintain records of the restitution 
order and its satisfaction and shall forward to the victim the property or payments 
made pursuant to the restitution order.
 

(f) Noncompliance with restitution order.--

Whenever the offender shall fail to

agent  designated  by  the  county  commissioners  of  the  county  with  the  approval 
of  the  president  judge  to  collect  restitution  shall  notify  the  court  within  20  days  of 
such failure. Whenever the offender shall fail to make restitution within 20 days to a 
magisterial district judge, as ordered, the magisterial district judge shall declare the 
offender in contempt and forward the case to the court of common pleas. Upon such 
notice of failure to make restitution, or upon receipt of the contempt decision from a 
magisterial district judge, the court shall order a hearing to determine if the offender 
is in contempt of court or has violated his probation or parole.
 
No  judgment  or  order  of  restitution 
shall  debar  the  owner  of  the  property  or  the  victim  who  sustained  personal  injury,

MANDATORY RESTITUTION (Sentencing Code)

 Mandatory Restitution in subsection 9721(c)

42 PA.C.S.A. § 9721
Sentencing Generally

(a)  General  rule.--

  
In  determining  the  sentence  to  be  imposed  the  court  shall, 
except as provided in subsection (a.1), consider and select one or more of the following 
alternatives, and may impose them consecutively or concurrently:

(1) An order of probation.
(2) A determination of guilt without further penalty.

4      Chapter 5     

Statutory Provisions and Rules of Court

(3) Partial confinement.
(4) Total confinement.
(5) A fine.
(6) County intermediate punishment.
(a.1) Exception.—
(7) State intermediate punishment.

 

(1) Unless specifically authorized under section 9763 (relating to a sentence 
of  county  intermediate  punishment)  or  61  Pa.C.S.  Ch.  41  (relating  to  State 
intermediate punishment), subsection (a) shall not apply where a mandatory 
minimum sentence is otherwise provided by law.
(2) An eligible offender may be sentenced to State intermediate punishment 
pursuant  to  subsection  (a)(7)  and  as  described  in  61  Pa.C.S.  Ch.  41  or  to 
State  motivational  boot  camp  as  described  in  61  Pa.  C.S.  Ch.  39  (relating  to 
motivational  boot  camp),  even  if  a  mandatory  minimum  sentence  would 
otherwise be provided by law.
(3)  An  eligible  offender  may  be  sentenced  to  total  confinement  pursuant  to 
subsection (a)(4) and a recidivism risk reduction incentive minimum sentence 
pursuant to section 9756(b.1) (relating to sentence of total confinement), even 
if a mandatory minimum sentence would otherwise be provided by law.

(b) General standards.--

 
In selecting from the alternatives set forth in subsection 
(a), the court shall follow the general principle that the sentence imposed should call 
for confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the 
offense as it relates to the impact on the life of the victim and on the community, and the 
rehabilitative needs of the defendant. The court shall also consider any guidelines for 
sentencing and resentencing adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing 
and  taking  effect  under  section  2155  (relating  to  publication  of  guidelines  for 
1
sentencing, resentencing and parole and recommitment ranges following revocation).
 
In  every  case  in  which  the  court  imposes  a  sentence  for  a  felony  or  misdemeanor, 
modifies a sentence, resentences an offender following revocation of probation, county 
intermediate punishment or State intermediate punishment or resentences following 
remand, the court shall make as a part of the record, and disclose in open court at the 
time of sentencing, a statement of the reason or reasons for the sentence imposed. In 
every case where the court imposes a sentence or resentence outside the guidelines 
adopted by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing under sections 2154 (relating 
to adoption of guidelines for sentencing), 2154.1 (relating to adoption of guidelines 
for county intermediate punishment), 2154.2 (relating to adoption of guidelines for 
State intermediate punishment), 2154.3 (relating to adoption of guidelines for fines), 
2154.4 (relating to adoption of guidelines for resentencing) and 2154.5 (relating to 
adoption of guidelines for parole) and made effective under section 2155, the court 
shall provide a contemporaneous written statement of the reason or reasons for the 
deviation from the guidelines to the commission, as established under section 2153(a)
(14) (relating to powers and duties). Failure to comply shall be grounds for vacating 
the sentence or resentence and resentencing the defendant.
In addition to the alternatives set forth in subsection 
 
(a)  of  this  section  the  court  shall  order  the  defendant  to  compensate  the  victim  of 
5      Chapter 5     

(c) Mandatory restitution.--

subsection, the term “victim” shall be as defined in section 479.1 of the act of April 9, 
2
1929 (P.L. 177, No. 175), known as The Administrative Code of 1929.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section 
 
9728 (relating to collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties) 
or  any  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  in  addition  to  the  alternatives  set  forth  in 
subsection (a), the court shall order the defendant to pay costs. In the event the court 
fails to issue an order for costs pursuant to section 9728, costs shall be imposed upon 
the defendant under this section. No court order shall be necessary for the defendant 
to incur liability for costs under this section. The provisions of this subsection do not 
alter the court’s discretion under Pa.R.Crim.P. No. 706(C) (relating to fines or costs).
 
by the court are set forth in this subchapter.

    in subsection (e)

42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9728
Collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties

(a) General rule.—

(1) Except as provided in subsection (b)(5), all restitution, reparation, fees, costs, 
fines and penalties shall be collected by the county probation department or other 
agent designated by the county commissioners of the county with the approval of 
the president judge of the county for that purpose in any manner provided by law. 
However, such restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties are part of a 
criminal action or proceeding and shall not be deemed debts. A sentence, pretrial 
disposition order or order entered under section 6352 (relating to disposition of 
delinquent  child)  for  restitution,  reparation,  fees,  costs,  fines  or  penalties  shall, 
together with interest and any additional costs that may accrue, be a judgment in 
favor of the probation department upon the person or the property of the person 
sentenced or subject to the order.(2) In accordance with section 9730.1 (relating 
to collection of court costs, restitution and fines by private collection agency), the 
collection of restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties under this section 
may be referred to a private collection agency. Statistical information relating to 
the  amount  of  restitution  collected  by  the  county  probation  department  or  any 
agent  designated  by  the  county  commissioners  of  the  county  with  the  approval

order, transmit to the prothonotary certified copies of all judgments for restitution, 
reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties which, in the aggregate, exceed $1,000, 
and it shall be the duty of each prothonotary to enter and docket the same of record 
in his office and to index the same as judgments are indexed, without requiring the 
payment of costs as a condition precedent to the entry thereof.
(2)  The  clerk  of  courts,  in  consultation  with  other  appropriate  governmental 
agencies,  may  transmit  to  the  prothonotary  of  the  respective  county  certified 
copies of all judgments for restitution, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties 
which,  in  the  aggregate,  do  not  exceed  $1,000,  and,  if  so  transmitted,  it  shall  be 
the duty of each prothonotary to enter and docket the same of record in his office 
and to index the same as judgments are indexed, without requiring the payment of 
costs as a condition precedent to the entry thereof.
(3) The county clerk of courts shall, upon sentencing, pretrial disposition or other 
order, transmit to the Department of Probation of the respective county or other 
agent designated by the county commissioners of the county with the approval of 
the president judge of the county and to the county correctional facility to which 
the offender has been sentenced or to the Department of Corrections, whichever 
is appropriate, copies of all orders for restitution and amendments or alterations 
thereto, reparation, fees, costs, fines and penalties. This paragraph also applies in 
the case of costs imposed under section 9721(c.1)(relating to sentencing generally).
(4) The total amount for which the person is liable pursuant to this section may be 
entered as a judgment upon the person or the property of the person sentenced 
or  ordered,  regardless  of  whether  the  amount  has  been  ordered  to  be  paid  in 
installments.
(5) The county correctional facility to which the offender has been sentenced or 
the Department of Corrections shall be authorized to make monetary deductions 
from  inmate  personal  accounts  for  the  purpose  of  collecting  restitution  or  any 
other  court-ordered  obligation  or  costs  imposed  under  section  9721(c.1).  Any 
amount  deducted  shall  be  transmitted  by  the  Department  of  Corrections  or  the 
county  correctional  facility  to  the  probation  department  of  the  county  or  other 
agent  designated  by  the  county  commissioners  of  the  county  with  the  approval 
of  the  president  judge  of  the  county  in  which  the  offender  was  convicted.  The 
Department of Corrections shall develop guidelines relating to its responsibilities 
under this paragraph.

(b.1) Restitution file.--

Upon receipt of each order from the clerk of courts as provided 
in subsection (b)(3), the department of probation of the respective county or other 
agent designated by the county commissioners of the county with the approval of the 
president judge of the county shall open a restitution file for the purposes of recording 
the  amounts  of  restitution  deducted  by  the  Department  of  Corrections  or  county 
correctional facility or collected by the department of probation or the agent designated 
by the county commissioners of the county with the approval of the president judge

(b.2)  Mandatory  payment  of  costs.--
of the county.

Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  law  to  the 
contrary, in the event the court fails to issue an order under subsection (a) imposing 
costs  upon  the  defendant,  the  defendant  shall  nevertheless  be  liable  for  costs,  as 
provided  in  section  9721(c.1),  unless  the  court  determines  otherwise  pursuant  to 
Pa.R.Crim.P. No. 706(C) (relating to fines or costs). The absence of a court order shall

not affect the applicability of the provisions of this section.

Notwithstanding  section  6353  (relating  to  limitation  on  and 
change in place of commitment) or 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(2) (relating to restitution for 
injuries to person or property), the period of time during which such judgments shall 
have full effect may exceed the maximum term of imprisonment to which the offender 
could have been sentenced for the crimes of which he was convicted or the maximum 
(d)  Priority.--
term of confinement to which the offender was committed.

Notwithstanding  any  other  statutory  provisions  in  this  or  any  other 
title, any lien obtained under this section shall maintain its priority indefinitely and no 
(e)  Preservation  of  assets  subject  to  restitution.--
writ of revival need be filed.

Upon  application  of  the 
Commonwealth,  the  court  may  enter  a  restraining  order  or  injunction,  require  the 
execution of a satisfactory performance bond or take any other action to preserve the 
availability of property which may be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution 
order under this section:

(1) upon the filing of a criminal complaint, information or indictment charging a 
criminal violation or a petition alleging delinquency for which restitution may be 
ordered and alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought 
appears to be necessary to satisfy such restitution order and judgment; and
(2) if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and an 
opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that:
 

(i) there is a substantial probability that:

 

(A) the Commonwealth will prevail on the underlying criminal charges or 
allegation of delinquency;
(B) restitution will be ordered exceeding $10,000 in value;
(C) the property appears to be necessary to satisfy such restitution order; 
And
(D)  failure  to  enter  the  order  will  result  in  the  property  being  destroyed, 
removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise made unavailable 
for payment of the anticipated restitution order; and

(f) Temporary restraining order.--

(ii) the need to preserve the availability of the property through the entry of the 
requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order 
is to be entered.

A temporary restraining order under subsection 
(e)  may  be  entered  upon  application  of  the  Commonwealth  without  notice  or 
opportunity  for  a  hearing,  whether  or  not  a  complaint,  information,  indictment 
or  petition  alleging  delinquency  has  been  filed  with  respect  to  the  property,  if 
the  Commonwealth  demonstrates  that  there  is  probable  cause  to  believe  that  the 
property with respect to which the order is sought appears to be necessary to satisfy

an  anticipated  restitution  order  under  this  section  and  that  provision  of  notice 
will  jeopardize  the  availability  of  the  property  to  satisfy  such  restitution  order  and 
judgment. Such a temporary order shall expire not more than ten days after the date on 
which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against 
whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested 
concerning an order entered under this subsection shall be held at the earliest possible

not limited to, any reasonable administrative costs associated with the collection of 
restitution, transportation costs and other costs associated with the prosecution, shall 
be borne by the defendant and shall be collected by the county probation department 
or other appropriate governmental agency along with the total amount of the judgment 
and  remitted  to  the  appropriate  agencies  at  the  time  of  or  prior  to  satisfaction  of

No  less  than  50% of  all  moneys collected  by  the county  probation 
department or other agent designated by the county commissioners of the county with 
the approval of the president judge of the county pursuant to subsection (b)(1) and 
deducted pursuant to subsection (b)(5) shall, until the satisfaction of the defendant’s 
restitution  obligation,  be  used  to  pay  restitution  to  victims.  Any  remaining  moneys

204 Pa. Code § 29.405

The  Supreme  Court  of  Pennsylvania,  pursuant  to  general  authority  set  forth  by  Art. 
V
,  §  10  of  the  Pennsylvania  Constitution,  and  42  Pa.C.S.  §  1721,  has  authorized  the 
Court  Administrator  of  Pennsylvania  to  promulgate  regulations  in  accordance  with 
all applicable statutory provisions pertaining to the distribution and disbursement of 
all fines, fees, costs, reparations, restitution, penalties and other remittances imposed 
and collected by the Criminal Division of the Courts of Common Pleas, Philadelphia 
Municipal Court, and any other entity on behalf of the Court using the Common Pleas 
Criminal Court Case Management System (CPCMS).

(1) Schedule for Standard Distribution of Funds Collected by the Criminal Division of 
the Courts of Common Pleas, Philadelphia Municipal Court, and any other entity on 
behalf of the Court Using the Common Pleas Criminal Court Case Management System 
(CPCMS).

9      Chapter 5     

Statutory Provisions and Rules of Court

(i)  All  fines,  fees,  costs,  reparations,  restitution,  penalties  and  other  remittances 
imposed  and  collected  by  the  Criminal  Division  of  the  Courts  of  Common  Pleas, 
Philadelphia Municipal Court and any other entity on behalf of the Court using the 
CPCMS shall be distributed in the following prioritized order:

(A) The collection agency fee provided for in 42 Pa.C.S. Section 9730.1 shall 
be  paid  first,  but  only  in  cases  wherein  the  private  collection  agency  has 
secured the funds from the defendant or a third party and the payment is 
made  to  the  court.  No  more  than  25%  of  each  payment  secured  from  the 
defendant by the private collection agency may be applied towards this fee.
(B) The Crime Victim Compensation Fund and Victim Witness Services Fund 
shall be paid, but only in cases in which the defendant has been sentenced to 
incarceration,  probation  or  is  admitted  into  an  accelerated  rehabilitative 
disposition program (see 18 P. S. § 11.1101). Otherwise, these costs shall be 
distributed in accordance with subsection (A)(6) of these regulations.
(C)  At  least  50%  of  any  additional  payment  shall  go  to  restitution  until  it 
is  paid  in  full  (see  42  Pa.C.S.  §  9728(g.1)).  When  restitution  is  ordered  to 
more than one recipient at the same time, the court shall set the priority of 
payment as follows, in accordance with 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(1)(ii)(A)--(D):

(I) the victim;
(II) the Crime Victim’s Compensation Board;
(III) any other governmental agency which has provided reimbursement 
to the victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct;
(IV) any insurance company which has provided reimbursement to the 
victim as a result of the defendant’s criminal conduct.

(D) Judicial Computer Project/Access To Justice (JCS/ATJ) Fee (see 42 Pa.C.S. 
§ 3733(a.1)).
(E) Electronic monitoring fees, offender supervision fees (as set forth in 18 P. 
S. § 11.1102(c)), alcohol highway safety school fees (see 75 Pa.C.S. § 1548(b)), 
service fees (such as sheriff’s fees set forth in 42 P. S. § 21101 et. seq., and 
constable’s fees set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 2950), transcript fees (see Pa.R.J.A. 
No.  000.7),  witness  fees  (as  provided  for  in  42  Pa.C.S.  §  5903),  and  other 
similar fees shall be paid based upon a pro-rated formula, unless the fees are 
prioritized by court order or the judicial district. The Administrative Office 
of Pennsylvania Courts may preclude a fee from being classified as an “other 
similar fee.” The amount of the payment allocated to each outstanding item 
shall be determined by dividing the outstanding balance for the individual 
item  by  the  combined  total  of  the  outstanding  balances  for  all  items.  The 
resulting  number  is  then  multiplied  by  the  amount  of  the  payment  to 
determine how much of the payment shall be allocated to the outstanding 
balance of the individual item involved.

For example, a defendant owes $80.00 in electronic monitoring fees, $10.00 
in offender supervision fees, and $10.00 in service fees, for a total of $100.00 
in outstanding fees. Defendant makes a payment of $10.00 in his/her case. 
To  determine  the  amount  to  be  allocated  to  electronic  monitoring  fees, 

10      Chapter 5     

Statutory Provisions and Rules of Court

 

divide the outstanding balance of the electronic monitoring fee ($80.00) by 
the combined total outstanding balances of all items ($80.00 + 10.00 + 10.00 
= $100.00). The result in this example is .8 (80/100). Multiply the resulting 
figure by the amount of the payment to determine the allocation to electronic 
monitoring fees, which in this example is $8.00 (.8 x $10.00= $8.00).
 
(F) All other fines, fees, costs, reparations, penalties and other remittances 
except  for  judgment  or  satisfaction  fees  shall  be  distributed  based  upon  a 
pro-rated formula. Specifically, the amount of the payment allocated to each 
outstanding item shall be determined by dividing the outstanding balance 
for  the  individual  item  by  the  combined  total  of  the  outstanding  balances 
for all items. The resulting number is then multiplied by the amount of the 
payment to determine how much of the payment shall be allocated to the 
outstanding balance of the individual item involved.

For example, a defendant owes $80.00 in costs, $10.00 in fines, and $10.00 in 
fees,  for  a  total  of  $100.00  in  outstanding  costs,  fines  and  fees.  Defendant 
makes a payment of $20.00 in his/her case. To determine the amount to be 
allocated to the fines, divide the outstanding balance of the fines ($10.00) by 
the combined total outstanding balances of all items ($80.00 + 10.00 + 10.00 
= $100.00). The result in this example is .1 (10/100). Multiply the resulting 
figure by the amount of the payment to determine the allocation to the fines, 
which in this example is $2.00 (.1 x $20.00= $2.00).

(G)  Fees  charged  by  the  clerk  of  courts,  prothonotary,  other  entity  in  the 
county  responsible for the distribution and disbursement of all fines, fees, 
costs, reparations, restitution, penalties, or other remittances, or the Clerk of 
Philadelphia Municipal Court for the entry or satisfaction of a civil judgment 
related to a criminal proceeding, as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 1725, 42 P. S. §§ 
21010,  21042,  and  21071  shall  be  paid  last.  The  amount  of  the  payment 
allocated to each fee shall be determined by dividing the outstanding balance 
for the individual fee by the combined total of the outstanding balances for 
both  fees.  The  resulting  number  is  then  multiplied  by  the  amount  of  the 
payment to determine how much of the payment shall be allocated to the 
outstanding balance of the individual fee involved.

For  example,  a  defendant  owes  $60.00  in  judgment  fees  and  $40.00  in 
satisfaction fees for a total of $100.00 in outstanding fees. Defendant makes 
a payment of $10.00 in his/her case. To determine the amount to be allocated 
to judgment fee, divide the outstanding balance of the judgment fee ($60.00) 
by the combined total outstanding balances of all items ($60.00 + 40.00 = 
$100.00). The  result  in  this  example  is  .6  (60/100). Multiply  the  resulting 
figure by the amount of the payment to determine the allocation to judgment 
fee, which in this example is $6.00 (.6 x $10.00 = $6.00).

11      Chapter 5     

Statutory Provisions and Rules of Court

(ii) Each payment shall be applied to a single case, unless otherwise ordered by the 
court.

(2)  The  county  probation  department  or  other  agent  designated  to  collect  all  fines, 
fees,  costs,  reparations,  restitution,  penalties  and  other  remittances  pursuant  to  42 
Pa.C.S. § 9728, shall use the Common Pleas Criminal Court Case Management System 
when performing collection related activities.
(3) Nothing in these regulations shall be applicable to the collection and/or distribution 
of any filing fee which is authorized by law. Filing fees shall include but not be limited 
to the clerk of courts automation fee set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. Section 1725.4(b).

as trials in criminal cases are conducted in the courts of common pleas when jury trial 
has  been  waived;  however,  in  all  summary  cases  arising  under  the  Vehicle  Code  or 
local traffic ordinances, the law enforcement officer observing the defendant’s alleged 
offense may, but shall not be required to, appear and testify against the defendant. In 
no event shall the failure of the law enforcement officer to appear, by itself, be a basis 
for dismissal of the charges against the defendant.
(C)  The  attorney  for  the  Commonwealth  may  appear  and  assume  charge  of  the 
prosecution.  When  the  violation  of  an  ordinance  of  a  municipality  is  charged,  an

eligibility for intermediate punishment.
(F) At the time of sentencing, the issuing authority shall:  

(1) if the defendant’s sentence includes restitution, a fine, or costs, state the date on 
which payment is due. If the defendant is without the financial means to pay the 
amount in a single remittance, the issuing authority may provide for installment 
payments and shall state the date on which each installment is due;
(2) advise the defendant of the right to appeal within 30 days for a trial 

de novo

 in 

   

   

the court of common pleas, and that if an appeal is filed:
(a) the execution of sentence will be stayed and the issuing authority may set 
bail or collateral; and
(b)  the  defendant  must  appear  for  the  de  novo  trial  or  the  appeal  may  be

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
