NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

AMY J. SUNDAY       

 

Appellant 

 

 

v. 

LIFFORD D. FORESTER; JULIA R. 
FORESTER; AND FORESTER & PAUL 
REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS, LLC 

 No. 110 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the Order Entered January 4, 2022, 
in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, 
Civil Division at No(s):  2020-04911-CV. 

EFORE:  BOWES, J., OLSON, J., and KUNSELMAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY KUNSELMAN, J.:       FILED: MARCH 23, 2023 

In this business-dissolution case, Amy J. Sunday appeals from the order 

directing her to execute a settlement agreement with some – but not all – of 

the defendants.  Because Ms. Sunday’s cause of action for dissolution against 

Forester & Paul Real Estate Holdings, LLC (“F&P” or “the LLC”) is unresolved, 

we quash this appeal as premature. 

On August 24, 2020, Ms.  Sunday sued  Clifford and  Julia  Forester and 

F&P.  In her Complaint, she raised three counts:  (1) against Mr. Forester and 

F&P for dissolution of the LLC, (2) against Mr. Forester for breach of contract, 

and (3) the Foresters for unjust enrichment.  See Complaint at 9-13. 

A lawyer entered her appearance on behalf of the Foresters.  However, 

no  attorney  entered  an  appearance  on  behalf  of  F&P.    As  such,  F&P  never 

appeared  to  participate  in  this  matter  before  the  court  of  common  pleas  or

this Court.1  Moreover, none of the defendants filed preliminary objections or 

an answer to the Complaint. 

The  docket  sat  essentially  dormant  for  a  year;  Ms.  Sunday  and  the 

Foresters negotiated a possible settlement.  On August 2, 2021 the Foresters 

filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement against Ms. Sunday.  The trial 

court received Joint Stipulations of Fact.  Following briefing, the court entered 

an order granting the motion to enforce, and Ms. Sunday appealed. 

After receiving Ms. Sunday’s notice of appeal and docketing statement, 

this Court issued a show-cause order.  We questioned, sua sponte, whether 

the appealed-from order was final, as Ms. Sunday asserted in her docketing 

statement.  See Superior Court Order, 3/8/22, at 1.  She filed a response to 

the order.  This Court discharged the show-cause order and deferred the issue 

of appellate jurisdiction to this merits panel. 

“The  establishment  of  jurisdiction  is  of  equal  importance  as  the 

establishment of a meritorious claim for relief.”  Robinson v. Pennsylvania 

Bd. of Probation & Parole,  582  A.2d  857,  860  (Pa.  1990).    Although  the 

parties  have  not  raised  appealability,  this  Court  “may  always  consider  that 

question on our own motion.”  Kapcsos v. Benshoff, 194 A.3d 139, 141 (Pa. 

Super. 2018) (en banc).

383 (Pa. 2021).

A jurisdictional issue presents us with “a question of law; the appellate 

standard of review is de novo, and the scope of review plenary.”  Id. 

This Court’s appellate jurisdiction only extends to “(1) a final order or 

an order certified by the trial court as a final order; (2) an interlocutory order 

as of right; (3) an interlocutory order by permission; (4) or a collateral order.”  

Chase  Manhattan  Mortgage  Corp.  v.  Hodes,  784  A.2d  144,  144  (Pa. 

Super. 2001).   

Ms. Sunday argues that the appealed-from order is final.  However, she 

omits the definition of a “final order” from her response to this Court’s show-

cause order, and she fails to analyze our jurisdiction in her brief.  Instead, Ms. 

Sunday claims the appealed-from order “is final because it requires [her] to 

sign a settlement agreement which has the effect of terminating the litigation 

. . . .”  Ms. Sunday’s Response to March 8, 2022 Order at 1 (citing Kulp v. 

Hrivnak, 765 A.2d 796 (Pa. Super. 2000)). 

Under the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, “an appeal may 

be taken of right from any final order of a . . . trial court.” Pa.R.A.P. 341(a).  

By definition, a final order “disposes of all claims and of all parties . . . [or] is 

entered as a final order pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Rule . . . .”  Pa.R.A.P. 

341(b).  Paragraph (c) provides: 

When  more  than  one  claim  for  relief  is  presented  in  an 
action,  whether  as  a  claim,  counterclaim,  cross-claim,  or 
third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the 
trial court or other government unit may enter a final order 
as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims and parties 
only  upon  an  express  determination  that  an  immediate 
appeal would facilitate resolution of the entire case.   Such 

- 3 - 

J-A09036-23 

an  order  becomes  appealable  when  entered.    In  the 
absence of such a determination and entry of a final 
order,  any  order  or  other  form  of  decision  that 
adjudicates fewer than all the claims and parties shall 
not  constitute  a  final  order.    In  addition,  the  following 
conditions shall apply: 

(1)   An  application  for  a  determination  of  finality 
under  paragraph  (c)  must  be  filed  within  30 
days of entry of the order.  During the time an 
application  for  a  determination  of  finality  is 
pending, the action is stayed. 

(2)   Unless the trial court or other government unit 
acts on the application within 30 days after it is 
filed,  the  trial  court  or  other  government  unit 
shall  no  longer  consider  the  application  and  it 
shall be deemed denied. 

(3)   A notice of appeal may be filed within 30 days 
after  entry  of  an  order  as  amended  unless  a 
shorter  time  period  is  provided  in  Pa.R.A.P. 
903(c).    Any  denial  of  such  an  application  is 
reviewable  only 
for 
permission to appeal under Pa.R.A.P. 1311. 

through  a  petition 

Pa.R.A.P. 341(c) (emphasis added). 

As mentioned, Ms. Sunday relies upon Kulp, supra, for the proposition 

that the appealed-from order is, in effect, a final order.  Admittedly, the Kulp 

Court  said,  “Although  the  instant  order  does  not  fit  any  of  [the  final-order 

definition]  perfectly,  we  must  consider  whether  the  practical  ramification  of 

the order will be to dispose of the case, making review appropriate.”  Kulp, 

765  A.2d  at  798  (citing  Commonwealth  v.  J.H.B., 760  A.2d  27,  28  (Pa. 

Super.  2000)).    Thus,  Ms.  Sunday’s  reliance  upon  Kulp  and  argument  that 

the order “effectively puts [her] out of court” is understandable.  Ms. Sunday’s 

- 4 - 

J-A09036-23 

is misplaced.   

Response to March 8, 2022 Order at 2.  Nevertheless, her reliance upon Kulp 

Twenty years ago, this Court rejected the statement from Kulp as being 

no longer good law.  In Brickman Group, Ltd. v. CGU Ins. Co., 829 A.2d 

1160, (Pa. Super. 2003), we explained as follows: 

[Appellant] urges that, in those cases where an order “does 
not fit any of these [Rule 341(b)] definitions perfectly,” this 
Court should “consider whether the practical ramification of 
the  order  will  be  to  dispose  of  the  case,  making  review 
appropriate.”   Kulp  .  .  . 765 A.2d [at] 798.    We  first  note 
that the  preceding  language  from Kulp traces its origin  to 
caselaw  evaluating  the  appealability  of  orders  prior  to  the 
1992  amendment  of  Rule  341.    See  [id.]  (citing 
Commonwealth  v.  J.H.B., 760  A.2d  [at]  28  .  .  .  (“In 
ascertaining  what  is  a  final  appealable  order,  this  Court 
must look beyond the technical effect of the adjudication to 
its  practical 
(quoting Grove  North 
America v. Arrow Lift & Constr. Equip. Co., . . . 617 A.2d 
369, 372 (Pa. Super. 1992)).   

ramifications.”) 

The Court in Robert H. McKinney, Jr., Associates, 
Inc.  v.  Albright, .  .  .  632  A.2d  937  (Pa.  Super.  1993), 
explained the significance of the 1992 amendment: 

Case  law  which  interpreted  the  earlier  provisions  of 
Rule  341,  considered  final  all  orders  which  had  a 
practical consequence of putting a litigant out of court.  
These included instances where a party was dismissed 
from a case or, in some circumstances, where some, 
but  not  all  of  the  counts  of  a  multi-count  complaint 
were dismissed.  Thus, finality was often determined 
without  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  litigation  did  not 
end as to all claims or all parties.  However, under the 
amended version of Rule 341, as quoted above, this 
is no longer the case for actions commenced after July 
6, 1992.  Under the [current] rule, an appeal may not 
be taken from an order dismissing less than all claims 
or all parties from a case.  An exception to this general 
rule  exists  under  subparagraph  (c),  whenever  an 

- 5 - 

J-A09036-23 

express  determination  has  been  made  by  the  trial 
court  that  an  immediate  appeal  would  facilitate 
resolution of the entire case. 

Id. at 938–39. 

[Appellant]  maintains  that  the  conditional  nature  of 
[appellee’s]  claims  against  the  additional  defendants 
rendered  them  essentially  dismissed  upon  the  granting  of 
summary  judgment  in  favor  of  [appellee].    Therefore, 
[appellant]  asserts,  we  should  consider  that  the  “practical 
ramification”  of  the  order  is  to  dispose  of  the  entire  case.  
Yet, it has been firmly established since the promulgation of 
the 1992 amendment to  Pa.R.A.P. 341 that orders can be 
considered  final  and  appealable  only  if  they  meet  the 
requirements set forth in the rule.  Keefer v. Keefer, 741 
A.2d 808 (Pa. Super. 1999) (quashing appeal where three 
actions consolidated into one and order did not dismiss all 
three 
claims  and  all  parties  arising  under 
actions); Prelude,  Inc.  v.  Jorcyk, 695  A.2d  422  (Pa. 
Super. 1997) (en banc ) (quashing appeals where order did 
not dismiss all defendants and finality determination under 
341(c) was not pursued notwithstanding  the fact  that  two 
remaining  defendants  had  filed  for  federal  bankruptcy 
protection) . . . 

the 

As  stated  by  the  majority  in Prelude, 695  A.2d  at 
422, “Rule 341 is fundamental to the exercise of jurisdiction 
by this court.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the rule 
has been rigorously applied.”  Id. at 424 (collecting cases). 
In Prelude, the case had been dismissed against all but two 
defendants.   The two remaining defendants both had filed 
for federal bankruptcy protection.  The Court held that the 
order dismissing less than all of the defendants was not a 
final,  appealable  order.    The  Court  further  noted  that  no 
finality determination pursuant to 341(c) had been pursued.  
Therefore,  the  Court  held  that  it  did  not  have  jurisdiction 
over the case and quashed the appeal.   

The  dissent  argued  [appellant’s]  position,  stating, 
“Because  Prelude  has,  in  effect,  been  put  out  of  court,  I 
believe that an immediate appeal from the trial court's order 
is  warranted.”   Id. at  425–426.    The  dissent,  while 
conceding that the appeal did not meet the requirements of 
Rule 341, nevertheless found quashal to be an “inequitable” 

- 6 - 

J-A09036-23 

result and urged a “liberal construction of Rule 341.”  Id. at 
425. 

Brickman Group, Ltd. v. CGU Ins. Co., 829 A.2d 1160, 1163–64 (Pa. Super. 

2003).  We quashed the appeal. 

Like the appellant in Brickman Group, Ms. Sunday argues for the same 

construction of Rule 341(b) as the dissent in Prelude.  Although the appealed-

from order does not perfectly meet the definition of a final order, she would 

have us overlook the absence of true finality, because the appealed-from order 

“effectively” puts her out of court.  As this Court sitting en banc has rejected 

that  approach  to  Rule  341(b),  we  may  not  apply  it  in  such  a  fashion.    See 

Prelude, supra.  To do so would be to exercise an appellate jurisdiction that 

has yet to vest under Rule 341(a). 

As stated, Ms. Sunday sued F&P for dissolution.   The LLC has  neither 

responded to her claim in an answer, nor has it filed preliminary objections.  

Additionally, F&P is not a party to the settlement agreement  which the trial 

court ordered Ms. Sunday to execute.   Thus,  the appealed-from order  does 

not dispose of “of all claims and of all parties,” because Ms. Sunday’s claim 

for dissolution against F&P remains pending before the trial court.  Pa.R.A.P. 

341(b)(1). 

Furthermore, Ms. Sunday did not ask the trial court to certify “that an 

immediate appeal  [from the order in question]  would facilitate resolution of 

the entire case . . . within 30 days of entry of the order.”  Pa.R.A.P. 341(c)(1).  

“In the absence of such a determination and entry of a final order, any order 

- 7 - 

J-A09036-23 

or other form of decision that adjudicates fewer than all the claims and parties 

shall not constitute a final order.”  Pa.R.A.P. 341(c) (emphasis added).  Nor 

did Ms. Sunday petition for permission to appeal with this Court regarding the 

appealed-from order.  See Pa.R.A.P. 341(c)(3); Pa.R.A.P. 1311. 

Therefore, the order is, by definition, not final. 

Also, the appealed-from order does not meet the definition of a collateral 

order.  Under, Rule of Appellate Procedure 313 a collateral order is “an order 

[(1)] separate from and collateral to the main cause of action, [(2)] where the 

right  involved  is  too  important  to  be  denied  review  and  [(3)]  the  question 

presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, 

the claim will be irreparably lost.”  Pa.R.A.P. 313(b).  While the enforceability 

of the settlement agreement is separable from the main cause of action, and 

Ms. Sunday’s rights under it are arguably too important to be denied review, 

those  rights  will  not  be  irreparable  lost  “if  review  is  postponed  until  final 

judgment in the case.”  Id.   

The Foresters may not enter a settlement agreement on behalf of the 

unrepresented LLC, which took no part in settlement negotiations, the motion 

to  compel,  or  this  appeal.    Accordingly,  the  Foresters  have  no  authority  to 

compel Ms. Sunday to discontinue her lawsuit against an unrepresented LLC.   

Thus, once the matter between Ms. Sunday and F&P resolves itself (via 

discontinuance or judgment), Ms. Sunday may appeal from the order resolving 

her case against it.  In a future appeal, Ms. Sunday may, if she wished, raise 

issues  regarding  the  order  that  directed  her  to  execute  the  settlement 

- 8 - 

J-A09036-23 

agreement with the Foresters.  If the trial court erroneously compelled her to 

sign the settlement agreement, the remedy of reversal will cure that error.  If 

that  occurs,  Ms.  Sunday  and  the  Foresters  may  resume  negotiations  or 

proceed to trial.  Either way, her rights would not be irreparably lost.  Thus, 

the appealed-from order is not a collateral order. 

Lastly,  the  order  is  not  an  interlocutory  order  appealable  as  of  right 

under Rule of Appellate Procedure 311.   

The order is unappealable.  See Chase Manhattan Mortgage, supra.  

We lack jurisdiction to decide the merits at this time. 

Oral argument scheduled for April 12, 2023, canceled.  

Appeal quashed.
