Received 06/30/2021 Supreme Court Eastern District 

Filed 06/30/2021 Supreme Court Eastern District 

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 

Docket No. 

In Re: First Judicial District of Pennsylvania â€” Philadelphia Municipal 

Court's Request Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 1952(B)(2)(s) to 
Temporarily Authorize Continuation of the Philadelphia 
Municipal Court Landlord-Tenant Diversion Program 

Patrick F. Dugan, President Judge of the Philadelphia Municipal Court, hereby requests 
the Supreme Court to temporarily authorize the continuation of the Philadelphia 
Municipal Court Landlord-Tenant Diversion Program, pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 
1952(B)(2)(s), and represents as follows: 

1.  In furtherance of,  and consistent with, the Judicial Emergency declared by the 

Pennsylvania Supreme Court and by the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania (see 
Administrative Order No. 9 of 2020, attached), the undersigned issued an Order on 
April 1, 2021 which required Landlords seeking possession based on non-payment 
of rent to file with the City of Philadelphia for Diversion/Rental Assistance, and to 
wait 45 days before filing a Statement of Claim against tenants (see Administrative 
Order Amended No. 15 of 2021, attached). 

a.  This pre-filing diversion program has been successful and has facilitated judicial 

management of landlord tenant cases. 

b.  The City of Philadelphia has received more than 33,000 applications for rental 
assistance and approximately 25,000 applications are pending review at this 
time, and $100,000,000 of federal funds for rental assistance remain available. 

2.  There are currently more than two thousand Alias Writs of Possession 

(lockouts/evictions) issued by the Court in pending cases and more than 900 Alias 
Writs of Possession (lockouts/evictions) which are imminently to be served upon 
cessation of any applicable moratoria. 

3.  It  is anticipated that the Court will be overwhelmed with filing of eviction cases based 
on non-payment of rent and that the continuation of the Philadelphia Municipal Court 
Diversion Program will enable the Court to manage the backlog of evictions and the 
anticipated filing of claims for possession based on non-payment of rent while both 
landlords and tenants seek to utilize the available funding as noted above. 

Therefore, the undersigned respectfully request that this Court authorize the 
Philadelphia Municipal Court to require that a landlord first file an application with the 
PHL Rent Assist Program through www.phirentassist.orq and then wait 45 days before 
filing a Landlord-Tenant Complaint seeking possession based on non-payment of rent. 
Such authorization and extension of the Philadelphia Municipal Court Landlord-Tenant 
Diversion Program shall terminate on August 31, 2021.

FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
PHILADELPHIA MUNICIPAL COURT 
President Judge Administrative Order 

Amended No. 15 of 2021 

In re: Residential Eviction Moratorium and Exceptions. Service of Writs and 

Alias Writs of Possession  

AMENDED ORDER 

AND NOW, this 1st day of April, 2021, the within Order is amended to read as follows: 

upon consideration of: 

(a)  the continuing global pandemic affecting the gathering of people, requiring social 
distancing, and preventing the listing of Landlord/Tenant cases in large numbers; 

(b) the Order dated March 28, 2021 issued by Rochelle P. Walensky, Director of the Centers 

for Disease Control and Prevention extending the eviction moratorium through June 30, 
2021; 

(c) the Eviction Diversion Program being conducted by the City of Philadelphia which has 
saved the court's resources, prevented negative consequences of eviction during a 
pandemic, and benefited landlords and tenants in coming to agreements in lieu of 
lawsuits; 

(d) the continuing declaration of Judicial Emergency in the First Judicial District, and the 

emergency powers provided under Pa.R.J.A. 1952(B) to order the diversion of cases 
through alternative dispute resolution programs for health and safety reasons 
accomplished both by reducing the congregation of litigants in the courthouse as well as 
by avoiding evictions through agreements facilitated by such eviction diversion 
programs; 

(e) the approximate one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000.00) in rental assistance 

funds that have been made available to the City of Philadelphia which may be accessed 
through the eviction diversion program; and 

(e) the Landlord Tenant Act which requires cases to be heard within 21 days, but as of the 
date of this order, due to the global pandemic, Landlord/Tenant trials are now being 
scheduled over ninety (90) days out, then, 

it is hereby ORDERED and DECREED that: 

(1) As of April 1, 2021, no landlord may file a Landlord Tenant Complaint seeking 

possession based on non-payment of rent owed prior to the date of filing until 45 
days after they have first completed an application with the PHL Rent Assist 
Program through www.phlrentassist.org. Upon completing the application, the 
landlord will be automatically enrolled in the Eviction Diversion Program as well. 
The PHL Rent Assist Hotline is (215) 320-7880.  It will be a dispositive affirmative 
defense for any tenant to show that the landlord did not pursue either rental 
assistance or eviction diversion through the City of Philadelphia Program timely or 
in good faith. 

(2) As of the date of this order, Plaintiff Landlords may only request the Landlord 

Tenant Officer to serve outstanding writs cfpossession that have not yet been served, 
other than those provided in Section (5) below. Provided, however, that the Landlord 
Tenant Officer shall insert "May 16, 2021" as the date the Named Defendant, 
Tenants and Occupants are to vacate the premises (" You are hereby to vacate 
premises ...  no later than 
intent of this order is to permit the service of the first of the two writs required for a 
Plaintiff Landlord to seek possession, in anticipation of the resumption of lockouts 
after June 30, 2021 or at some other point in the future when conditions permit. 

.") on the writ of possession Cover Sheet. The 

(3) No alias writs cfpossession issued by the Philadelphia Municipal Court shall be 

served in any residential case (i.e., no residential evictions) until after May 16, 2021, 
except upon order of court previously entered or upon good cause shown as provided 
in this order. 

(4) In residential cases, Plaintiff Landlords who have not already obtained an exemption 

who have obtained a judgement of possession may seek leave of court to be 
exempted from the eviction moratorium by filing a petition, supported by exhibit(s) 
and sworn affidavits or declarations subject to the penalty of perjury, establishing 
good cause to serve a writ of possession or an alias writ of possession, pursuant to 
any of the following bases: 

(a)  Good faith belief based on first-hand knowledge that the tenant has already 

vacated the unit/property. 

(b) Breach of the lease terms, such as alleged criminal conduct or damage to the 
property, served as the basis for the Judgement of Possession.  Habitual non-
payment, late payment of rent or non-payment of utilities shall not be good cause 
under this order. Plaintiff Landlords should demonstrate a material breach in 
support of their petition. 

(c)  Landlords owning no more than five (5) rental units, either individually or 

through separate entities, who are in severe financial distress, supported by filed 
documentary evidence (i.e., not solely testimonial evidence) of such distress. 

(d) Other compelling basis not specifically enumerated above, which shall be strictly 

scrutinized to ensure that the negative effects of a residential eviction during the 
pandemic are mitigated to the satisfaction of the Court. 

(5) Notwithstanding the relief available as provided in Section (4) above, Plaintiff 

Landlords are not entitled to request leave of court for permission to serve writs of 
possession or alias writs of possession if the eviction is otherwise prohibited by law, 
such as provided in the September 1, 2020 Order issued by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, as extended through June 30, 2021. 

(6) Calculation of the six-month period set forth in Rule 126(e) ("[a]n alias writ of 
possession may not be issued after six months from the date of the judgment for 
possession without leave of court") and the 180-day period for serving alias writs of 
possession (the practice of the Philadelphia Municipal Court is to serve the alias writ 
of possession within 180 days from the entry of a judgment for possession), shall 
exclude the time from March 16, 2020 through and including May 16, 2021, from the 
computation of those time periods. Landlords may file petitions to extend this 180 
day period. 

7) The Court will be closely monitoring the implementation and impact of the 
(

provisions of this order and the conditions surrounding the pandemic to determine 
the necessity of continuing, modifying or terminating any or all of the terms of this 
order. 

(8) This Order supersedes conflicting provisions contained in any prior Administrative 

Order.
