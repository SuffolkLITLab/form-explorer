      <pre>Received 07/29/2021 Supreme Court Middle District 

Filed 07/29/2021 Supreme Court Middle District 

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 

In Re: Seventh Judicial District of Pennsylvania — 

No. 43 MM 2020 

Bucks County Court of Common Pleas' Request 

Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2)(m) and (s) to 

Temporarily Authorize the Court Action to Reduce 

Evictions Program 

Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2)(m) and (s), Wallace H. Bateman, Jr., President Judge of 

the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, hereby requests the Supreme Court to temporarily 

authorize implementation of the Court Action to Reduce Evictions Program and in support of his 

request represents as follows: 

1. 

Notwithstanding the expiration of the formal judicial state of emergency in the 

Commonwealth and the Seventh Judicial District, the economic and societal effects of the COVID-

19 pandemic continue. 

2. 

In consideration of the adverse impacts of the pandemic specific to the context of residential 

tenants and in an attempt to broaden the reach and effectiveness of the Bucks County Emergency 

Rental Assistance Program ("BERA"), which benefits both tenants and landlords by securing 

delivery of available government funds to satisfy past and ongoing rental obligations in appropriate 

cases, the Court worked with County agencies to formulate the Court Action to Reduce Evictions 

program ("eviction reduction program").  See Exhibit "A," proposed Administrative Order. 

3. 

To summarize, the eviction reduction program provides for a mandatory 30-day continuance 

of all residential landlord tenant actions for non-payment of rent in which BERA certifies that an 

application for assistance has been submitted and further provides for a discretionary continuance 

upon request of the defendant, without BERA certification, indicating that such an application has 

been or will be made.  The continuance, whether entered on a mandatory or discretionary basis, may 

be extended one time for an additional thirty days, and no more than one continuance may be 

imposed in any case.  In practice, the nature and indicated length may bring a continuance entered 

pursuant to the order into conflict with Pa.R.C.P.M.D.J. Nos. 209 (as applied to hearing) and 515-

519 (as applied to orders of possession). 

4. 

The BERA program has been successful in mitigating the harmful effects of eviction during 

the pandemic.  As of July 28, 2021: 

a.  BERA has received $56,134.176.00 in federal funding. 

b.  1,589 applications for assistance have been submitted to BERA, of which 859 have 

been approved thus far, resulting in $7,789,761.18 being distributed to landlords on 
behalf of tenants and thereby allowing the tenants to avoid eviction.  102 

applications are in the process of payment. 

c.  402 applications remain under review.  The time necessary for review varies 

substantially based on the completeness of the application upon submission, but 

generally review is complete in not more than 60 days. 

5. 

It is  anticipated that with the July 31, 2021 expiration of the CDC Order imposing a 

moratorium on evictions, filing activity in actions for recovery of possession of residential real 

estate, including both new cases and requests for orders of possession, will increase dramatically, 

creating incentive for more tenants to apply for the assistance offered by BERA. The expected 

influx of new filings is in addition to the 325 hindlord/tni-Lut cases filed since the onset of the 

pandemic in March 2020, that await hearing, and the 1,874 judgments entered for the plaintiff in that 

timeframe, many of which have not yet proceeded to possession. 

6. 

The continuances contemplated by the eviction reduction program will permit courts to 

better manage their caseloads and allow BERA to complete the application review process prior to 

any potential eviction, thereby securing funds in appropriate cases sufficient both to satisfy landlords 

and to allow tenants to retain their residences. 

Wherefore, given the above and the considerations cited in the preamble of the attached 

proposed administrative order, the undersigned respectfully requests that the Court enter a special 

order pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2)(s) to authorize the Bucks County Court of Common 

Pleas to implement the Court Action to Reduce Evictions program pursuant to the terms of the 

attached proposed administrative order through October 31, 2021 or such other time as the Court 

deems appropriate, and, pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2)(m) insofar as the timeframes 

described therein may conflict with Pa.R.C.P.M.D.J. Nos. 209 and 515-519, to temporarily suspend 

the operation of said rules as applied to matters subject to the program, for the duration of the 

program. 

iNa-e Al •-•  

Wallace H. Bateman, Jr. 

President Judge 

Bucks County Court of Common Pleas 

IN THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA 
CIVIL DIVISION 

IN RE: ADOPTION OF COURT 
ACTION TO REDUCE 
EVICTIONS PROGRAM 

: ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 

And now, this 

day of 

, 2021, upon consideration of: 

ORDER 

1.  the continuing economic effects  of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including with 

particular  relevance  to  this  order,  job  losses  and the  attendant  income reduction or 

elimination for those who have lost employment, many of whom rely on residential rental 

properties to provide shelter for themselves and their families; 

2.  the potential negative impacts upon individuals,  families  and public health  caused by 

eviction for those who due to the above economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 

have been unable make the timely payments required to maintain their residential rental 

3.  the pending July 31, 2021, expiration of the CDC Order originally issued on September 1, 

2020, and most recently extended on June 24, 2021, which continuances all  residential 

evictions for non-payment of rent upon submission of a declaration in compliance with 

arrangement; 

the Order; 

4.  the existence of available government funds to assist both tenants facing eviction and 

landlords whose rental income has been reduced or eliminated due to the combination of 

the  economic effects  of the  COVID-19 pandemic and the  continuance on evictions 

imposed by the CDC Order; and 

5.  the valuable work of the Bucks County Emergency Rental Assistance (`SERA") program 

and other similar organizations for the benefit of tenants and landlords in both educating 

the public regarding die availability of government assistance, and securing delivery of 

funds to satisfy past and ongoing rental obligations in appropriate cases; 

it  is  ORDERED and DECREED that the Court Action to  Reduce Evictions program is 

adopted as follows: 

1.  At any  time  subsequent to  commencement of an action  for  recovery  of possession  of 

residential real property for non-payment of rent, any party to the action,  or BERA upon 

consent of a party to the action, may submit a request to the presiding Magisterial District 

Judge for a continuance of proceedings, which request shall be signed by a representative of 

BERA and certify  that the defendant has applied for  emergency rental assistance.  Upon 

receipt by the Magisterial District Judge of such a request, all proceedings, including pending 

execution on any order of possession, shall be continued for 30 days. 

2.  If a request for continuance pursuant to this  order is  not submitted by or not signed by a 

representative of BERA, the Magisterial District Judge, if satisfied that a good faith application 

for rental assistance has been or will be submitted to BERA or another comparable assistance 

agency, may continue the matter in her or his sole discretion for 30 days. 

3.  In the Magisterial District Judge's sole discretion, a continuance pursuant to this order may be 

extended for an additional 30 days upon request or sua sponte.  One such extension of the 

continuance may be granted; no further extension is permitted.  No continuance shall exceed 

a total of 60 days, and only one continuance pursuant to this order may be imposed in any 

action. 

4.  Should the BERA application be denied, withdrawn, or otherwise finally  determined in  a 

manner adverse to the applicant during the continuance period, the Magisterial District judge 

may in her or his discretion terminate the continuance and the action shall proceed. 

5.  A continuance pursuant to  this  order  shall  be imposed only in  actions  for  recovery  of 

possession of residential real property for non-payment of rent in which an application for 

rental  assistance  has  been submitted to BERA or another comparable assistance  agency. 

Nothing herein shall be construed to require imposition of a continuance in actions brought 

for reasons other than non-payment of rent or actions in which no application for rental 

assistance has been submitted. 

6.  A continuance imposed pursuant to this order prior to expiration of the order shall survive 

the expiration of the order and may be extended as permitted above.  Said continuance shall 

expire 30 or 60 days from imposition as directed herein. 

This order shall be effective August 1, 2021, and shall expire on October 31, 2021.
