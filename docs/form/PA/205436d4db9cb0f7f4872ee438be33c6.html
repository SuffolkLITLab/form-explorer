IT leadership transitions 

After nearly 35 years of dedicated service with the 
judiciary, Director of AOPC Information Technology Amy 
Amy 
Ceraso retired in June. 
Ceraso

For the last 20 years, Amy has led AOPC IT through many 
technological advances that have augmented the AOPC’s 
mission in supporting the administration of justice. 

Amy has worked for the Pennsylvania Courts throughout 
her entire legal career. During those 35 years, she said 
that she has seen many things change drastically, but 
what she’s enjoyed most was the opportunity to be a part 
of a team that developed systems that have significantly 
improved the delivery of court services throughout the 
Commonwealth. 

“When I started at AOPC, there were barely any county 
case management systems in place, let alone statewide 
ones. Now we have over 20,000 people using our case 
management systems, and we provide data to scores of 
state and county agencies. When I look at what has been 
accomplished, I am proud of what we’ve done, particularly 
in the last several years in building innovative systems 
like the Guardianship Tracking System,” she said. 

“As director, I’ve been able to help build a strong and 
professional IT team that will hopefully continue on this 
path, and I truly appreciate all of their hard work and 
commitment. I’m also thankful for the opportunity to 
have worked with so many wonderful people who make 
the court and justice systems run - at all levels of court, 
including our partners at JNET and other state agencies, 
and of course, my colleagues at AOPC.”

In retirement, Amy looks forward to playing more golf, 
reading the pile of books that she has accumulated over 
the years and hopefully, doing a lot of traveling. 

Upon her retirement, Assistant Director of IT Russel 
Russel 
Montchal will take over as director. Russel has been with 
Montchal
the AOPC for 22 years, six of those as assistant director. 

“We are so fortunate to have incredibly smart and 

dedicated people that work in the IT Department. We 

are always looking for ways to make tangible, positive 

contributions for the courts,” Russel said.

“I look forward to building new relationships and cultivating existing ones in 
collaborating with the many internal and external groups that enable us to 
successfully accomplish improved efficiencies and workflow through the use of 
technology for the Pennsylvania Judiciary.”

April and May were fairly quiet months legislatively, with the chambers meeting on a 

handful of days. That changed in June as the House and Senate were both scheduled for

12 voting days, leading up to the passage of the 2021-22 budget. 

Budget   
Budget

The judiciary’s 2021-22 budget request includes three 
points.  The first is a modest 5.7 percent increase in state 
funding – state funding has been flat since FY 2015-
16. The second and third are statutory changes critical 
to the operation of the judiciary. One is a repeal of the 
annual diversion of $15 million from the Judicial Computer 
System – a third of the system’s annual budget – to ensure 
operations continue without impact. The other is the 
reauthorization of what is known as “Act 49” surcharges, 
which provides for a significant portion of the judiciary’s 
general operations budget. The surcharges are set to 
expire later this year.    

Constitutional amendment to change the entity 
Constitutional amendment to change the entity 
that advertises constitutional questions 
that advertises constitutional questions 

Readers will recall from the last newsletter a discussion 
about a Department of State error in failing to advertise 
legislative passage of a constitutional amendment 
providing for a two-year window to bring childhood sexual 
abuse civil claims. In addition to the need to restart the 
amendment process, the error has resulted in legislation to 
modify advertisement procedures.   

HB 1010 would amend the constitution to replace the 
Secretary of the Commonwealth with the Legislative 
Reference Bureau (LRB) or a successor legislative agency, 

3

as the entity responsible for publishing constitutional 
amendments. The bill also requires that the second 
publication of proposed amendments include only the 
language of the amendment, the ballot question to be 
used and a summary of the amendment as prepared by 
the LRB or successor agency. The legislation passed 
the House 113-88 and was referred to Senate State 
Government. If the Senate also passes the bill, it will 
have to be considered and passed again in the 2023-24 
legislative session before it could appear on the ballot. 

Sovereign immunity and two-year window
Sovereign immunity and two-year window

House Bill 951 provides for a two-year window to 
commence civil actions when the individual was under 18 
years of age at the time the cause of action ensued, and 
the time limitation for the cause of action has expired. 
Additionally, the bill applies the sexual abuse exception 
to the defenses of sovereign and governmental immunity 
“retroactively to a cause of action that arose prior to the 
effective date of this subparagraph [i.e., immediately upon 
enactment]” and, “prospectively to a cause of action that 
arises after the effective date,” respectively. 

The bill grants the Pa. Supreme Court with extraordinary 
jurisdiction to hear challenges to, or render declaratory 
judgements concerning, the constitutionality of the 
provisions. It states that the Court may take action as it 
deems appropriate, consistent with the court retaining 

jurisdiction over the matter, to find facts or to expedite 
a final judgement in connection with the challenge or 
request for declaratory relief.

The House passed HB 951 by a vote of 149-52.  The bill 
was reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 
vote of 11-3 and is pending further action.

Sentencing – murder of unborn child 
Sentencing – murder of unborn child 

HB 1095 addresses the decision in Commonwealth v. 
Haynes, 125 A.3d 800 (Pa.Super.2015), clarifying that 
convictions of third degree murder of an unborn child, 
murder of an unborn child and voluntary manslaughter of 
an unborn child require a sentence of life. The bill passed 
the House 123-80 and was referred to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 

District attorney/attorney general law licenses
District attorney/attorney general law licenses

SB 420 adds a qualification of district attorneys to the 
County Code – specifically, that the individual continually 
hold an active law license during the period he/she is 
in office. The legislation creates a process for situations 
when a district attorney is disbarred or suspended. If 
disbarred, the office is considered vacant, and the vacancy 
must be filled pursuant to the provisions of the respective 
County Codes.  

If the district attorney’s license is suspended, the district 
attorney is suspended from the office until the sooner of 
reinstatement or term expiration. If the first assistant is 
willing and qualified, he/she acts as the district attorney 
during the suspension. If the first assistant is unwilling 
or unqualified, the Court of Common Pleas appoints a 
competent person meeting the requirements. 

The bill passed the Senate unanimously and has been 
referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

Senate Bill 457 is a constitutional amendment governing 
the qualifications of the attorney general, clarifying 
that he/she must be an active member of the bar. The 
legislation establishes a process for situations when the 
attorney general is disbarred or suspended. If disbarred, 
the office is considered vacant.  

If the attorney general’s license is suspended, the first 
deputy attorney general if qualified and able to hold the 
office, serves as the acting attorney general until the 
sooner of the reinstatement of the license, or the expiration 
of the current term. If the first deputy attorney general 
is not qualified or able to serve, the executive deputy 
attorney general of the Criminal Law Division serves as the 
acting attorney general.  

The bill was reported unanimously from the Senate 
Judiciary Committee and is pending further consideration.

Failure to appear for payment determination

SB 516 allows issuing authorities to turn delinquent 
accounts over to private collection agencies or county 
collection enforcement units when a defendant fails 
to appear for a scheduled and noticed financial 
determination hearing. The bill was reported 13-0 from the 
Senate Judiciary Committee and is pending further action 
in the Senate.  

Compulsory Joinder Statute and Perfetto
Compulsory Joinder Statute and Perfetto

SB 588 addresses the decision in Commonwealth v. 
Perfetto, 652 Pa. 101 (2019), clarifying that prosecution 
is not barred for offenses based on the same conduct or 
arising from the same criminal episode if the offense for 
which the defendant was formerly convicted or acquitted 
was a summary offense or a summary traffic offense. A 
companion bill has been introduced in the House – HB 
1231. SB 588 was reported 12-0 from the Senate Judiciary 
Committee and is pending further action in the Senate.

School Justice 
Partnership introduced 
in Allegheny County 

In an effort to divert youth away from school-related 
arrests and toward supportive, restorative and skill-
building alternatives, Allegheny County Juvenile Probation 
has recently signed a contract with the National Center of 
State Courts (NCSC) Court Consulting Services. 

The goal of the new partnership is to strengthen existing 
relationships and build new formal agreements between 
Allegheny County schools and the Court's Juvenile Court 
Division. 

There is inherent overlap between schools and juvenile 
court. Not only is school connectedness a protective factor 
to keep youth out of the justice system, but those who 
experience exclusionary school discipline (like out-of-
school suspensions and expulsions) are significantly more 
likely to enter the juvenile justice system in the subsequent 
year.  

Additionally, students of color are significantly more likely 
to experience exclusionary school discipline and referrals 
to court for school-based incidents.  

School justice partnerships aim to reduce these negative 
outcomes and support student success by implementing 
formal agreements between courts and schools.

Dwayne Woodruff, Allegheny County Juvenile 

With the leadership of Allegheny County Common Pleas 
Judge Dwayne Woodruff
Court has partnered with three schools to develop 
strategies for reducing referrals to court and plans to 
initiate partnerships with two additional schools this year.  

With support from the Pittsburgh Foundation, NCSC 
will provide support in sustaining existing partnerships, 
coordinating new partnerships and evaluating the efforts.  

The evaluation will end up documenting what these 
School Justice Partnerships look like in action and assess 
the extent to which they are being implemented as 
intended.  

The hope is that this work not only contributes to positive 
outcomes for young people and their communities, but 
also informs similar partnerships in other school districts.  

For more information on this work, please contact Teri 
Deal at tdeal@ncsc.org.

Water intrusion project at the PJC

Working with AOPC Administrative Services, 
the Pa. Department of General Services 
is managing and funding the public works 
project. 

As construction continues, the fencing will 
remain around the front of the building through 
September, when work will then move to the 
right side of the building facing North Street. 

Currently ahead of schedule, the project is 
slated to be completed in December. 

Throughout the duration of the work, AOPC 
Administrative Services staff have attempted to 
minimize any disruptions caused by the noise, 
doing their best to identify and work around 
court hearings and shift meetings to the side of 
the building opposite to the construction site.   

Employees and visitors will continue to have 
access to the PJC front entrance during the 
entire construction period.

For any questions about the project, please 
contact Administrative Services (Facilities) at 
AdminSrvDept-Facilities@pacourts.us.

Employees working in the Pennsylvania Judicial Center (PJC) 
who have been reporting into the office may have noticed fencing 
around different areas of the building over the past several months. 

The process first began several years ago to resolve a leak in the 
building’s foundation and restore the areas where water damage 
had occured.

Emerging issues in elder law 

In May, the AOPC Judicial Education 
Department held a virtual, two-part 
program for judges that focused on 
identifying the emerging issues in 
elder law and how courts should 
address them.  

During the program, speakers 
identified the physical, social and 
emotional characteristics of the 
elderly population and explored 
how these traits make them uniquely 
vulnerable.  

Judges learned about the general 
victimization, and particularly the 
prevalence of financial exploitation, 
within this group. 

The course laid out for judges what 
financial exploitation can look 

like, types of evidence they can 
anticipate lawyers will present and 
what safeguards and resources are 
available.  

Representatives from the Pa. Office 
of Attorney General, Pa. Department 
of Aging, Temple University/ Beasley 
School of Law and the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office all presented on a range of 
topics, including: 

•  Cognitive aging, mild cognitive 
impairment and dementia
•  Neglect of a care-dependent 

person 
Enforcement of nursing home 
failure-of-care cases
Elder financial abuse 

• 

• 

Sheila Woods-Skipper were 

Lois 
Montgomery County Judge Lois 
Murphy
Murphy and Philadelphia County 
Judge Sheila Woods-Skipper
featured presenters during the 
second part of the course, where they 
discussed specific considerations for 
the courts to address in elder abuse 
and exploitation cases. 

They explained some of the unique 
issues faced in elder abuse cases, 
how courts can meet the needs of 
elderly victims, the different tools 
available for different courts in 
preserving assets, recommended 
practices when seniors are witnesses, 
exploitation that can occur using 
power of attorneys etc. 

WHAT THE COURTS CAN LEARN 
FROM IMPLICIT BIAS RESEARCH

The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery last 
year prompted court leaders around 
the country to adopt a resolution to 
“intensify existing efforts” to improve 
racial equity in the justice system. 
At the same time, NCSC researchers 
were working to update a previous 
report examining implicit bias.

The recently released report – The 
Evolving Science on Implicit Bias: An 
Updated Resource for the State Court 
Community – explains how implicit 
bias fits into broader conversations 
about equity and fairness; defines 
commonly used terms originating 
from the science of implicit bias; and 
summarizes current research in the 
psychological and brain sciences, 
including implicit bias strategies 
generally found to be effective and 
ineffective.

In the report, NCSC researchers 
Jennifer Elek and Andrea Miller 
write that implicit bias, sometimes 

also referred to as unconscious 
bias, is a term often used to refer 
to the attitudes and beliefs people 
have about others that they may be 
unaware of, and it manifests itself 
everywhere, including in the courts. 
Removing these biases is difficult 
because people are not always fully 
aware of their influence. But there 
is hope that they can be lessened, 
according to research.

The report lists three key takeaways 
from the scientific research on implicit 
bias:

•  One of the most effective 

strategies for reducing prejudice 
and discrimination is through 
positive, meaningful intergroup 
contact 

• 

Implicit bias interventions that 
attempt to change implicit 
associations in memory are not 
consistently effective 

• 

Implicit bias interventions 
that bypass or disrupt biased 
responding show more promise 

Funded by the State Justice Institute 
and NCSC, the report also addresses 
some implications of this knowledge 
for state court leaders, lawyers and 
others, and it defines key terms and 
clarifies how they’re used.

Research on implicit bias continues 
to develop, and there are a lot of 
unknowns. But court leaders must be 
aware that implicit bias exists and 
combat against it in order to more 
effectively provide justice for all.

“In the meantime,” Elek and Miller 
wrote, “court leaders forge ahead, 
continuing to make the best decisions 
they can with the knowledge we have 
today."

Judge Lois Murphy accepting Champion of Justice award during virtual ceremony

Judge Murphy honored as Champion of Justice

In early May, Hon. Lois Murphy
Lois Murphy, administrative judge of the 
Montgomery County Orphans’ Court Division, was honored 
as a Champion of Justice by the SeniorLAW Center.

Among her many contributions to the advancement of 
elder justice across the Commonwealth, Judge Murphy 
serves on the Advisory Council on Elder Justice in the 
Courts. She has served on both the Pa. Supreme Court’s 
Elder Law Task Force and Elder Justice Roundtable of 
Montgomery County.

She has also helped to update the Orphans’ Court Rules, 
draft the Elder Abuse Bench Book and Guardianship 
Bench Book, and has been commended for her work on 
new guardianship forms and case management systems.

“I cannot think of a more deserving recipient 
of SeniorLAW Center’s Champion of Justice 
Award than Judge Lois Murphy. I have had 
the pleasure of working side by side with 
Judge Murphy for the past eight years through 
our Supreme Court’s Elder Law Task Force 
and Advisory Council on Elder Justice. She 
is so much more than a participant in our 
efforts to protect and advance the interests of 
Pennsylvania seniors, she is a leader,”  
Pa. Supreme Court Justice Debra Todd said.  

7

Judge Paula Ott
Paula Ott also offered her congratulations 
saying, “Judge Lois Murphy’s award from the SeniorLAW 
Center is well deserved.  She is an invaluable member 
of the Advisory Council and brings her vast courtroom 
experience in Orphans’ court and her innovative ideas 
to improve the lives of those under guardianship in 
Pennsylvania.” 

Judge Murphy was first elected to the bench in 2009, 
after having served as a litigator for the U.S. Department 
of Justice and spending time in private practice serving 
individuals, families and charities.

She earned both her undergraduate and J.D. at Harvard 
University.

Culturally-responsive practices 
in the courts 

Using STOP Grant funds, AOPC Judicial District Operations 
offered a two-part, virtual training on culture and bias in 
May. 

court staff to minimize the impact of implicit bias in DV 
cases.

Held a week apart, the first of the 90-minute webinars 
focused on culturally-responsive practices in the courts 
while the second webinar addressed bias in domestic 
violence (DV) cases. 

Around 60 people attended each session including minor 
court administrators, who took this course as part of their 
annual MDJ Court Administrator Workshop. 

The training was presented by Nida Abbasi, associate 
director of Gender & Family Justice at the Center for Court 
Innovation and Jose Juan Lara, project manager at Casa 
de Esperanza/National Latin@ Network. 

The goal of the first part of this training was to discuss 
culturally-specific barriers experienced by survivors 
seeking legal relief in the Pennsylvania justice system, 
identify role-specific responsibilities in implementing these 
practices and design strategies for overcoming those 
challenges. 

During the second training, participants explored how to 
distinguish between systemic and individual bias in the 
legal system, how implicit bias can prevent litigants from 
accessing justice on DV cases and assess strategies for 

With positive feedback among those who attended, the 
training will later be modified and offered as separate 
webinars to court administrators and department 
supervisors, common pleas and magisterial district judges 
and frontline court staff.  

To supplement these trainings, there are also plans to 
develop a series of short webinars for all court employees 
including judges, managers/supervisors, front line staff, 
row offices etc., with each webinar exploring a different 
culture based on the top languages where interpreters are 
requested. 

In 2020, those languages were Spanish, American Sign 
Language, Chinese, Nepali, Russian, Arabic, Vietnamese, 
Portuguese, Haitian Creole and Korean. 

These trainings will help familiarize court employees with 
the practices, beliefs and customs of people from different 
cultures and backgrounds who come to the courthouse 
using local community partners who can talk about what 
they see in their communities and suggest practical tips on 
ways the court can be more accessible.

Recognizing AOPC’s frontline workers 

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as most of the 
AOPC’s staff transitioned to working remotely, there 
remained a group of essential staff who stayed onsite 
and have reported to the office since the beginning of 
the pandemic, servings as the organization’s “frontline 
workers.”

These personnel are deserving of our gratitude as they 
have played a uniquely vital role in ensuring that court 

operations remained functional and effective during the 
unprecedented, and at some parts daunting, times faced 
throughout the past year and a half. 

To all of the court employees who fall in this category – 
from facilities staff and department directors to NOC/Help 
Desk staff and various administrative assistants, etc. – the 
AOPC recognizes and appreciates all of your contributions 
and sacrifices that have been made. 

Veterans Treatment Court Virtual Summit 

In May, the AOPC Problem-Solving Courts held a two-day 
Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) Virtual Summit where over 
150 participants heard from a panel of qualified experts 
about issues of importance in the veteran-treatment 
community. 

During his presentations, he described some of the 
established norms, beliefs and embedded principles of 
military personnel and how treatment court professionals 
and mentors can structure their programs around these 
shared traits to optimize participants’ success.  

Dr. Brian Meyer hosted three sessions throughout the 
summit presenting on effective substance use disorder 
treatments for justice-involved veterans; identifying and 
providing treatment for traumatic brain injury; and effective 
clinical interventions for justice-involved veterans. 

Speaking about mentor-mentee relationship fundamentals, 
Philadelphia Veterans Court Mentor Coordinator Tim 
Wynn described ways that mentors can build effective 
relationships by being responsive, dependable, 
empathetic and non-judgmental. 

Scott Tirocchi, U.S. Army Major (ret.) and Justice for Vets 
division director, also presented on both days of the 
training explaining ways to leverage military cultural 
nuances to the participants’ benefit and apply principles of 
criminogenic risk and need in VTCs. 

Other panelists went into details about how to identify and 
provide treatment for veterans with military sexual trauma 
and posttraumatic stress disorder. 

The summit was recorded and has been posted on the 
AOPC Problem-Solving Courts webpage. 

Virtual town halls address elder abuse and financial exploitation

what to do if abuse is suspected and available resources. 

The discussions took place on WebEx and were streamed 
live on both Facebook and YouTube. Elders without access 
to the internet were able to participate by telephone. 

In recognition of Elder Abuse Awareness Month, the Pa. 
Advisory Council on Elder Justice in the Courts held two 
virtual town hall sessions educating older Pennsylvanians, 
caregivers, senior organizations and other stakeholders 
on recognizing and preventing elder abuse and financial 
exploitation. 

The Advisory Council partnered with the Pa. Department 
of Aging, Pa. Office of Attorney General, Pa. Department 
of Banking and Securities and the SeniorLAW Center 
to raise awareness about how these issues affect 
Pennsylvania’s elders. 

On June 16, the first session focused on elder abuse, 
while the following week’s town hall on June 23 
addressed financial exploitation of elders. 

Participants heard from both victims and panelists 
about their experiences with these issues, what the 
Pennsylvania’s courts and its elder justice partners are 
doing to address them, how to recognize elder abuse,

New rule changes mandate small procedural 
changes in district court security

The Pa. Supreme Court recently 
approved proposed amendments to 
Pa. Rules of Judicial Administration 
1950-1952 and 1954, requiring all 
district court facilities to implement 
emergency action plans (EAPs) 
and requiring local court security 
committees to meet at least twice a 
year. 

The proposed rule changes were the 
result of the work by the Magisterial 
District Court Security Task Group, 
whose report was issued in August 
2020. 

Later this fall, AOPC Judicial District 
Operations and Judicial District 
Security will be providing trainings 
to judicial districts to help courts 
implement or enhance their EAPs and 
run their local court security committee 
meetings – as mandated in these rule 
changes that take effect Jan. 1, 2022. 

administrator, a magisterial district 
judge and a member of the county 
executive branch. Often these 
committees include the sheriff and 
representatives from other county 
offices housed in the court facilities. 

The purpose of these committees is 
ultimately to make recommendations 
to the president judge on security 
protocols, policies and procedures and 
communicate that information to all 
court employees. 

The training will offer a sample 
agenda that these committees 
are encouraged to consider when 
preparing for these meetings. A few 
critical points to cover during these 
meetings include the reviewing of 
PAJIRS incidents, EAPs and Continuity 
of Operations Plan (COOP), and 
other security projects, trainings and 
assessments. 

The first training will offer best 
practices for hosting dynamic, 
effective local court security 
committee meetings. 

Chaired by the president judge, 
members of the local security 
committees include the district court 

The second training, “The ABC’s of 
EAPs,” will outline exactly what is 
expected to be included in a court’s 
EAP and offers a template to help 
districts complete this task. 

An EAP, different from a COOP plan, 
is a concrete plan for courts to use 

during an emergency. These plans 
require a level of customization 
that contains specific guidance that 
court employees can follow in the 
event of an emergency including 
escape routes, emergency assembly 
locations, notification protocols etc.

Emergencies can be man-made or 
of natural origin. Some examples of 
emergency events that EAP’s should 
specifically address include utility 
outages, active attacker situations, 
severe weather, medical emergencies, 
suspicious packages, judicial threats 
etc. 

The training will cover the three main 
sections that should be included in 
an EAP and give specific examples 
for what needs to be identified before 
the emergency happens, what to do 
during the actualized emergency 
event and how to handle the situation 
after the emergency has ended.  

While judicial districts should certainly 
prioritize these security efforts, the 
work required to comply with these 
new rule changes should be minimal – 
especially for those courts who have 
established good collaboration with 
their county partners and already 
engage in routine review of their 
security posture. 

Legal advice vs. procedural information

their own opinion or legal 
interpretation to litigants. 
The presenters clarified that 
the only time court staff 
may help litigants fill out 
a form is if the litigant has 

a disability that prevents 
them from doing so. 

A recording of the full 
training is available here.

The AOPC’s Judicial District 
Operations Department 
recently sponsored a virtual 
training on “Legal Advice 
vs. Procedural Information.” 

Judicial Programs 
Administrator Rick Pierce
Rick Pierce 
and Berks County Deputy 
Lisa 
Court Administrator Lisa 
Siciliano
Siciliano presented the 
webinar that explained 
how court staff can help 
self-represented litigants 
without crossing a legal 
line. 

The webinar was held 
at the beginning May 
with around 640 people 
attending virtually including 

court administration staff 
and frontline court staff in 
MDJ courts and court-filing 
offices. 

When it comes to assisting 
self-represented litigants, 
court staff are only allowed 
to provide procedural 
information including 
forms and instructions 
for a particular pleading 
upon request, or answer 
technical questions such 
as where to file documents, 
how much it costs, how 
many copies etc. 

The training emphasized 
the need for court staff to 
refrain from ever providing

IT couple rides 
for a cause 

During the first weekend of May, AOPC IT Systems Analyst 
Amy Hyde
Dan Hyde 
Amy Hyde and IT Senior Project Manager Dan Hyde 
participated in an annual charity event to raise money for 
children with muscular dystrophy – a cause near and dear 
to the couple’s hearts. 

Dan and Amy first became involved in the Muscular 
Dystrophy Association (MDA) Ride for Life in 2016 when 
they became members of the Cumberland Valley Harley 
Owners Group (HOG). 

Participating in the event every year are Harley 
Davidson owners, riders, dealerships, HOG chapters 
and local families who have been affected by one of the 
neuromuscular diseases that MDA supports. 

Despite this year’s event being scaled back with only a 
fraction of the normal participants due to COVID, their 
sponsoring dealership alone raised $30,000. Nearly 
$498,000 was raised and donated in total.  

All the money raised goes directly to supporting the 
families with medical bill payments, wheelchair and other 
essential purchases, and pays for a week of summer camp 
for the children. 

Held at the Lebanon County Expo Center, the weekend-
long event started on Saturday with a silent auction, corn 

12

hole competition, FMX stunt show and a dinner reception, 
followed by music and dancing. 

On Sunday morning, 300 motorcycle riders went on a 
police-escorted parade through downtown Lebanon 
followed by an hour-long motorcycle ride around Lebanon 
County – with many of the MDA ambassadors, who are 
all children living with neuromuscular disease, riding in 
sidecars. 

Dan and Amy’s HOG chapter sponsors a local family that 
has twin 15-year-old boys who are affected by Duchenne’s 
disease, a severe type of muscular dystrophy. 

“Throughout the years, as we have both gotten to know 
the boys and their parents personally, we have seen the 
effects this disease has on the entire family. This MDA 
event, and helping these families in any way we can, 
became very important to us,” Amy said. 

Together, they continue to raise money, volunteer and 
participate in this wonderful event each year – which many 
of the MDA ambassadors say is the highlight of their year.

IT cybersecurity tips 

Cleaning up your cyber footprint

aking the time to clean up your technology and cyber footprint not only 

helps remove digital clutter from your life, but it can be important for 
protecting your personal information online. 

•  Review your passwords and update them as needed. 
• 

Enable multi-factor authentication on accounts wherever it is available 
– especially on accounts that contain financial or personal information 
such as online banking, credit card, retirement accounts etc.

•  Review and update your contacts. Delete contacts that are no longer 

•  Review applications on your devices and remove those you no longer 

necessary or current.

use. 

•  Review social media accounts and associated privacy settings. If you 

want to delete a social media account, make sure you delete your entire 
profile – not just the app.

•  Review your backup routines and schedule and test the backups to 

validate they are being successfully completed.

Pulling the Plug? Row Over Court Budget 
Could Shutter Pa.’s Docket System
With the $45 million diverted through Act 42 of 2018 and the additional money 
taken to help with the most recent budget shortfall, the JCS budget has sustained 
a $75 million loss over the past three years, the documents say.

By Max Mitchell | May 12, 2021

Pennsylvania court officials are 
now worried that unless some of its 
IT budget is restored after years of 
diversion of funds, they will be forced 
to shut down the statewide docketing 
system, creating filing difficulties 
across the state and impacting 
criminal justice.

According to letters obtained by The 
Legal, repeated budget diversions 
over the past few years, which were 
exacerbated last year by a $30 
million reallocation from the court’s 
budget to shore up the state’s COVID-
affected 2020-21 budget, now mean 
that the court will be forced to begin 
winding down the Common Pleas 
Computer Management System 
starting in July if current funding 
levels remain in place.

The CPCMS, which is a central hub 
for statewide criminal dockets and 
court information, is relied on by 
attorneys, court and law enforcement 
for everything from uploading legal 
filings to performing inter-county 
warrant searches by police officers.

“The impacts of this reality are 
manifold. Collections to state, 
county and local governments not 
only will be interrupted but almost 
certainly will be diminished,” a 
letter Chief Justice Max Baer sent 
to leaders of the state Senate and 
House appropriations committees 
in March warned. “Additionally, the 
existing implementation of statewide 
legislative policies such as Clean 
Slate and lottery and tax intercept 
for restitution will no longer be 
possible. Moreover, a real threat to 
public safety will accompany the 
loss of ‘real-time’ data exchanges, 

including warrant databases used 
by law enforcement and information 
on dependent children utilized by 
judges.”

Letters recently obtained by The 
Legal show that, along with Baer, 
Court Administrator of Pennsylvania 
Geoff Moulton has been reaching out 
to state officials, including president 
judges, county commissioners and 
legislators, in an attempt to relay their 
concerns about the looming budget 
and raise awareness.

data to state agencies, including state 
police, PennDOT and the Department 
of Revenue.

“It would be an absolute catastrophe 
for the entire state of Pennsylvania 
and the criminal justice system,” said 
James Troutman, who has been clerk 
of courts for Berks County for more 
than 30 years. “It’s just terrible to think 
about it. … I’m praying they don’t, with 
67 clerks of courts, have to go back 
to 15 years ago when we had our own 
systems.”

The letters, all sent in early March, 
outline the recurring budget 
diversions, and ask the recipients 
to reach out to state legislators to 
help ensure the General Assembly 
becomes aware of the situation as 
part of their effort to restore some of 
the funding. 

One letter from Moulton to the 
County Commissioners Association 
of Pennsylvania says that, based on 
current budget projections, if funding 
is not restored in this cycle, new 
systems will have to be put in place 
and all existing data will need to be 
migrated over to those systems by 
December 2022.

The current statewide docketing 
system, which includes criminal, 
dependency and juvenile 
delinquency, has been in place at 
most counties since 2006. According 
to state officials, without CPCMS, 
counties would be forced to develop 
their own individual docketing 
systems, with no guarantee that any 
of the systems would communicate 
with each other. It could also mean 
losing the ability to transfer court 

14

According to Brinda Penyak, deputy 
executive director at the County 
Commissioners Association, it is 
impossible to know exactly what the 
fallout would be if the AOPC had to 
wind down the CPCMS, but it would 
mean that these systems would need 
to rely on funding at the local county 
level, rather than at the state level.

“Counties don’t have a lot of 
resources for revenue. There would 
be kind of a pass along there,” she 
said. “It would be a really hard 
consideration for the counties to figure 
that out. We wouldn’t want to head in 
that direction until we absolutely have 
to.”

The current problem stems in large 
part from a three-year-old piece of 
legislation, Act 42 of 2018, which 
has allowed legislators to divert $15 
million annually from the Judicial 
Computer System into the state 
General Fund to help pay for school 
safety. 

The JCS budget, which was 
established in 1987, is primarily 
funded from fines, court costs and 
fees. Known as a restricted revenue 

account, it is designed to be self-
funding and cannot be funded through 
taxes.

According to the AOPC letters, as 
well as the court’s 2021-22 budget 
proposal, for the past 10 years, the 
JCS budget has been largely flat, 
however, under Act 42 of 2018, 
legislators have diverted $15 million 
from the budget each year for the 
past three years. Then, an additional 
$30 million was taken out of the 
JCS budget to help balance the 
most recent funding accord the state 
approved in November. With the 
$45 million diverted through Act 42 
of 2018 and the additional money 
taken to help with the most recent 
budget shortfall, the JCS budget has 
sustained a $75 million loss over the 
past three years, the documents say.

The latest budget proposal from Gov. 
Tom Wolf does not include restoration 
of any funding that had been 
previously diverted.

In an emailed statement, Lyndsay 
Kensinger, a spokeswoman for the 
governor’s office, expressed support 
for restoring the funding.

“The administration agrees that the 
transfers are unsustainable and plan 
to work with the General Assembly to 
address the upcoming fee expiration,” 

she said, referring to additional 
revenue for the courts under Act 49 of 
2009, which is expected to expire at 
the end of the year.

A spokeswoman with the AOPC 
confirmed the budget diversions, but 
did not comment further about the 
situation.

Neither Sen. Patrick M. Browne, 
R-Lehigh, nor Sen. Vincent Hughes, 
D-Philadelphia, who are chairmen of 
the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
returned a call seeking comment. 
House Appropriations Chairman Stan 
Saylor, R-York, also did not return a 
call seeking comment.

Megan Augustine, press secretary 
for Rep. Matthew Bradford, 
D-Montgomery, said in an emailed 
statement that Bradford fully supports 
“the courts and a restoration of funds 
in the 2021/22 budget.”

“A failure to fix this budgetary issue 
creates an imminent problem, 
beginning on July 1, that would result 
in a shutdown of the Common Pleas 
Case Management System,” she said. 
“This would threaten critical public 
and law enforcement safety systems, 
as well as statutory requirements such 
as the Clean Slate Program.”

One effect from the court’s letters is 
that some in the state’s criminal justice 

system are stepping up to make 
legislators aware of the situation.

During a budget hearing in March, 
Secretary of Corrections John Wetzel 
told lawmakers that allowing the 
CPCMS to disappear “would grind 
the entire criminal justice system to 
a halt,” noting that it would affect 
background checks, record checks 
and victim notifications.

“It’s kind of the hub and the spokes. 
It’s a pretty critical aspect of the 
criminal justice system’s data right 
now,” he told legislators.

Troutman also said he has also been 
speaking with his representatives. 
Although he said he is hopeful, 
he said animosity and mistrust 
between many legislators and the 
courts could be at play in the recent 
budget diversions. But, he had 
one suggestion for what the courts 
should do if legislators don’t provide 
sufficient funding for the JCS by the 
July 1 budget deadline.

“If I was the courts, I would file 
a mandamus action and sue the 
legislature for proper funding,” he 
said. “If they have to, go into court 
and get it straightened out because 
we cannot give up this system.”
