UBJECT:  Judicial Conduct Board Elects Executive Committee 

ARRISBURG,  PA  –  At  its  February  14,  2023  meeting,  the  Judicial  Conduct  Board  of 
Pennsylvania  (“Board”)  voted  to  make  the  chairs  of  the  Budget  and  Personnel  Committees 
members  of  the  Executive  Committee.    Thereafter  the  Board  elected  the  following  slate  of 
members for its Executive Committee:  Nancy L. Clemens as Chair, Magisterial District Judge 
William  C.  Wenner  as  Vice  Chair,  Scott  B.  Cooper,  Esquire  as  Secretary,  President  Judge 
Emeritus (ret) Susan Peikes Gantman as Chair of the Board’s Budget Committee, and Sudhir R. 
Patel, Esquire as Chair of the Board’s Personnel Committee.  

he  twelve-member  Board  is  an  independent  Board  within  the  Judicial  Branch  of  the 
Commonwealth’s  government  comprised  of  twelve  Pennsylvania  citizens:  three  judges,  three 
lawyers and six non-lawyer electors. The Governor and the Supreme Court each appoint six of 
the  Board’s  members.  The  Board’s  members  serve  four-year  terms,  without  pay,  and  no  more 
than one-half of its members may be from the same political party.  

reated by constitutional amendment in 1993, the Board reviews, investigates, and, where 
warranted,  prosecutes  complaints  of  judicial  misconduct.    If  the  Board,  by  majority  vote, 
decides  that  there  is  probable  cause  to  believe  that  a  judge  engaged  in  misconduct,  the  Board 
may file a complaint in the Court of Judicial Discipline where the Board must prove the charges 
against the judge by clear and convincing evidence.  The Court of Judicial Discipline decides if 
the Board has sustained its burden of proof and also decides the sanction to be imposed upon the 
judge for any proven misconduct.
