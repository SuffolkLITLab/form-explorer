Welcoming 
Pennsylvania’s 
New Courthouse 
Facility Dog 
Advisor 

Jerri Rook and Ludo

Jerri	Rook, executive assistant to Lycoming County 
President Judge Nancy	Butts, is also the handler for 
Lycoming County’s Courthouse Dog, Ludo. 

our facility dogs to assist other counties where there are 
no current programs and to help facilitate programs in 
courthouses looking to start their own program.”

In early summer of 2022, Jeri was appointed by the 
Courthouse Dogs Foundation to be the Pennsylvania State 
Coordinator of Justice Facility Dogs U.S. 

Courthouse Dogs Foundation educates legal professionals 
about the benefits of using courthouse facility dogs, 
including information on reducing stress during legal 
proceedings and how to successfully implement a 
courthouse facility dog program using best practices in this 
field. 

Jerri previously worked for former Lycoming County 
Judge Joy	Reynolds	McCoy, who was the family court, 
dependency and juvenile delinquency judge. McCoy was 
instrumental in starting a dog program in their county.

In 2018, their first facility dog, Jedi, who was donated by 
Canine Companions, began working with children in the 
court system. They then started to work with victims in 
the criminal system, victims of domestic violence and 
treatment courts. 

Jerri is currently working on compiling a list of working 
courthouse facility dogs and their handlers in the state, 
as well as organizations that may have a facility dog that 
works in a courthouse. 

Jedi was diagnosed with lymphoma in September 2021. 
Although they started the chemo process, he was too weak 
to continue chemo and sadly passed away in November 
2021. 

As a member of Courthouse Dogs Foundation, Jerri 
wanted to learn all that she could about courthouse facility 
dogs and provide training in the areas where she uses her 
facility dog, Ludo. 

“The foundation and program have brought so many 
handlers together and long-lasting friendships are made 
through them,” she said. “They also provide much needed 
support and training to the handlers. My hope is to 
someday have a statewide facility dog program to allow

In April 2022, Jerri was invited back to Canine Companions 
for a successor dog, and Ludo started working in June. 

“I could go on and on about the dogs I’ve worked 
with. They have changed my life for the better, that’s for 
sure,” added Jerri. “I hope that in the future, all courthouses 
have a facility dog available for their visitors, staff, victims 
and children.”

Pa. Supreme Court Advisory Council Releases Latest Progress 
Report and Data on Elder Abuse and Guardianships 

Focused on addressing critical issues confronting 
Pennsylvania’s elders, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s 
Advisory Council on Elder Justice in the Courts recently 
released its latest progress report and data on the status of 
guardianships statewide. 

“The progress recounted in this report represents our 
ongoing effort to address the challenges facing our 
commonwealth’s elders,” Chief Justice of Pennsylvania  
Debra	Todd said. 

“As Pennsylvania’s population ages, the court 
system faces an unprecedented challenge 
to monitor guardianships and protect our 
vulnerable adults from financial exploitation 
and abuse... The collective work of this council 
and our agency partners will become even more 
critical in changing and saving the lives and 
protecting the dignity of our elders,”  
Chief Justice Todd said. 

Since the Task Force report was released in 2014, from 
among the recommendations offered, the Council identified 
the need for a Guardianship Tracking System (GTS), which 
allows courts to better monitor active guardianships 
through a statewide uniform process. 

“This report is a testament to the Pennsylvania Courts 
and their agency partners’ commitment and dedication to 
Pennsylvania’s older adults,” Montgomery County Common 
Pleas and Orphans’ Court Judge Lois	Murphy said. “The 
collective accomplishments and initiatives continue to 
serve as a blueprint for courts and others to follow.” 

“As a result of the Council’s work, including through the 
extraordinary challenges faced during the global pandemic, 
statewide guardianship data and other critical information 
is now available to guardians, interested organizations and 
the public,” continued Murphy. “This will change and save 
lives.” 

Rolled out in 2018, the GTS permits courts to scrutinize 
red flags prompted on guardianship cases and respond to 
potential problems immediately, allowing better oversight 
and protection for persons under guardianship. The 
statewide data contained in GTS allows the Advisory 
Council to track guardians’ compliance with filing 
mandated reports and take a data-driven approach to 
guardianship reform. 

“The ability to generate accurate and comprehensive 
statistics from the data collected by GTS is critically 
important, as nationally there is a dearth of information 

3

available on 
guardianship 
cases,” said 
Advisory Council 
Chair, the Hon. 
Paula	Francisco	
Ott. 

“With the data 
and additional 
information 
available, we are 
better equipped 
to address 
the needs and 
challenges facing 
Pennsylvania’s 
aging population 
and to improve and 

protect access to justice for elders.” 

As of Dec. 31, 2021, there were more than 18,000 active 
guardianship cases in GTS, with 382 professional guardians 
and more than 19,000 non-professional (family/lay) 
guardians. The total amount of guardianship assets under 
court supervision was more than $1.7 billion. 

In addition to the new GTS data available, the Council has 
focused on efforts to educate judges, court staff, attorneys, 
guardians and the public about elder abuse and financial 
exploitation, including: 

• 

Training programs, educational sessions and materials 
for judges, including the Pennsylvania Guardianship 
Bench Book and Pennsylvania Elder Abuse Bench 
Book

•  Use of advanced communication technology as a 
means for homebound elders and long-term care 
residents to access essential support and court 
services, including participating in hearings

•  Virtual town hall sessions focused on the prevention of 
and response to elder abuse and financial exploitation 
and on recognizing alternatives to guardianship

• 

Training programs and resources for family and 
lay guardians about their powers, duties and 
responsibilities.

Caseload  
Statistical Data 
Updated for 2021

Caseload stats are updated annually, 
and the interactive data dashboards 
on the Pa. Courts website now reflect 
verified data for calendar year 2021.  

Data dashboards are used to identify 
court trends and are heavily relied 
upon by judges and court staff to 
manage court operations. In addition 
to being a valuable resource for court 
management, the dashboards also 
help to assure court data is easily 
accessible and transparent.

The dashboards are a series of 
interactive, digital data visuals that 
simplify how users look up court data. 
They allow court staff, researchers, 
reporters and the public to quickly sift 
through caseload data and analyze 
and interpret court statistics at a 
glance. 

A wide range of caseload data 
is accessible through the 
dashboards including civil, 
criminal, magisterial district 
court, orphans’ court, custody 
and divorce, child dependency, 
paternity and support, juvenile 
delinquency, problem-solving 
courts and protection from abuse 
statistics. 

Data are used by the judiciary 
in policy development, program 
evaluation and workload analysis – 
and also by organizations outside the 
judiciary including the Legislature 
and other county, state and federal 
agencies.

Caseload statistics are available both 
statewide and at the county level 
on the judiciary’s website at www.
pacourts.us under the “Research and 
Statistics” page. In addition, monthly 
preliminary data for 2022 are also 
now available and posted under the 
caseload highlights tab.

Sharpsburg judge 
sends a trauma-
informed message 
with art and animals

By Abby MacKey

Copyright ©, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2022, all rights 
reserved. Reprinted with permission.

Fox Chapel-area District Magisterial Judge Matt	
Rudzki	knows those appearing in his, or any, court 
feel a sense of “helplessness.”

Whether they’re there to fight a speeding ticket, solve 
a landlord-tenant dispute, or, for juveniles, to defend 
themselves against accusations of vaping in school or 
truancy, those individuals — and those who support 
them — are stressed.

And for many, there’s another layer of anxiety.

Research shows that 70 to 90% of youth offenders 
have experienced one or more types of trauma, and 
there’s mounting evidence that childhood trauma 
exposure is likely a key risk factor for run-ins with the 
law.

That trauma can be triggered by knowing they are not 
in control, being confined to a small space (that some 
district magisterial courtrooms and waiting rooms 
are), having to face accusers or abusers, or even the 
colors on the wall.

“Most of the people coming into court are there on, 
what is likely, the worst day of their lives,” he said. 
“We need to meet people where they are.”

For Rudzki, who took the bench in January after one 
term as the mayor of Sharpsburg, that’s achieved 
by acknowledging all the facets of trauma-informed 
justice.

He’s one of only two Allegheny County district 
magisterial judges to offer night court — held on 
the last Thursday of every month — to allow citizens 
to avoid the stress of missing work or school. He 
covers his waiting room walls with locally created art 
stamped with positive affirmations. And he’s the only 
magisterial judge in the county to invite therapy dogs 
and trained handlers.

“I think you get better responses from people when 
they’re comfortable, and they know they’re in a setting 
where they’re being heard,” he said. “It’s intimidating 
to be in front of a judge in robes. I want to try to break 
own those barriers.”

Man’s	best	friend

Animal Friends Therapets liaison Marcy Fenell didn’t know 
what to expect when she brought a dog to Rudzki’s courtroom 
for a experimental visit in April.

The organization’s therapy dogs have experience inside Beaver 
County family courtrooms, but in Rudzki’s case, they’re asked 
to visit in the waiting room, once per month on days when 
juvenile cases are heard.

“It helps the kid in question, but also those around he or she,” 
Fenell said. “It makes people a little bit nicer, chills them out a 
little bit, because you aren’t focused on being the next one in 
the court.”

Volunteer handlers of Therapets dogs are trained to only 
engage with individuals who seem willing, and to do so while 
essentially ignoring their environment — ask no identifying 
information and nothing about the reason for their presence.

Instead, they introduce their dogs, talking about funny things 
they do or what they like. Often, those visiting the courtroom 
will offer stories about their own pets.

But the dogs offer more than distraction: They’re scientifically 
proven to lower stress hormones.

“The last few years have been tough for everybody,” Fenell 
said. “When someone is going in to meet with the judge, I think 
if you’re in a happier, better frame of mind, there’s probably a 
better outcome for everybody.”

Art	with	authority

Whether it’s a juvenile day or not, those visiting Rudzki’s 
courtroom need only look at the waiting room walls for a 
reminder that their current situation is impermanent and a 
shared experience.

that’s exactly who she wanted to reach,” Mr. Whysong said. 
“We know that mental health is a huge part of what comes 
across Matt’s desk. So, being able to provide that support, 
that’s what the whole goal is.”

Compassion	rules

Before Rudzki invited therapy dogs into his courtroom, 
he sought the approval of 5th Judicial District President 
Judge Kimberly	Berkeley	Clark, who was “very glad” to 
approve his request. Not only does it align with her own 
beliefs about trauma-informed court, but also she knows 
such initiatives are supported by the Pennsylvania Judicial 
Roundtable, on which she serves.

“Many people who have issues that lead them to court, 
they also have histories of poverty and trauma and a lot 
of other things,” she said. “What we want to do is at least 
do no additional harm, and really understand how trauma 
impacts everything.”

While night court, art and therapy dogs are all appreciated, 
those are just part of how sensitivities are displayed.

“The physical space is part of being trauma-informed, but 
I’m not sure it’s the first part of it,” Clark said. “A lot of it

is the atmosphere the judge creates, being respectful of 
people, being understanding and patient.”

Issues such as space in magisterial district courtrooms 
and waiting rooms, lease agreements in those buildings, 
budgets, and concerns about allergies or phobias of dogs 
all factor into why some jurists choose not to partner with 
therapy animal programs or other more demonstrative 
gestures of trauma-informed justice, she said.

And there are those with even more robust programs. 
In the 5th Judicial District’s Family Division, led by 
Administrative Judge Kim	D.	Eaton, trauma-informed 
measures are unmistakable, with a playground, wellness 
center, sensory room, wiring to dock kids’ electronic 
devices and decor in therapeutic colors.

Six pieces of abstract art emblazoned with messages such 
as “You matter,” “It’s OK to not be OK” and “You are not 
alone,” decorate the waiting room walls.

While the messages are meaningful, their backstory lends 
authority.

Katie Whysong was a Fox Chapel School District middle 
school student when she was diagnosed with depression. 
After hearing about a program where students and 
teachers decorated school restrooms with positive 
messages, she approached her art teacher, Nanci 
Goldberg, with a similar idea, thinking it was a way to reach 
kids battling mental illness, just like her.

Goldberg championed the idea, but then the COVID-19 
pandemic hit.

Although Katie received unwavering support from her 
parents, Alisa and Todd Whysong, friends, doctors, 
medication and therapies, she took her own life 10 days 
after her 15th birthday in March 2021.

Soon after she died, her parents picked up a piece of mail 
meant for their daughter. It was a welcome packet from 
the Human Rights Campaign to which she’d donated her 
allowance money.

“She was really into advocacy for mental health, just any 
kind of marginalized community,” Ms. Whysong said. “She 
was really a little activist.”

To honor Katie’s legacy, they started the nonprofit Positive 
Painting Project. At events, which are held at community 
gatherings and in schools, individuals paint whatever 
strikes them onto canvases. After they dry, one of six 
“messages of hope” are screen printed on top of their 
art, and they’re hung in public spaces such as schools, 
businesses and, now, Rudzki’s courtroom.

“I think the extension of her interest in human rights to 
what Matt’s doing would please her, that she would feel 

Other measures include Clark’s years-old initiative to adopt 
time-specific hearings rather than forcing defendants and 
families to wait for unknown amounts of time — a policy 
that continues to spread to other jurists. In the future, she’d 
like to adopt hospital-like progress screens for juvenile 
cases, where defendants are assigned numbers instead of 
having cases paged on a loudspeaker.

But no matter how implicit or overt the efforts, they express 
compassion that can permanently alter how citizens 
interact with the legal system.

“I can make all the right decisions, but if I deliver the 

message in a way that’s disrespectful or not trauma-
informed, litigants may perceive that the system is not fair,” 
she said.

Although trauma-informed court may not require the 
existence of hope-inspiring art or therapy animals, there 
are benefits to such obvious displays, as Rudzki sees 
it: “I think people want change, and people can see I’m 
implementing that change on the bench.”

New Director of Juvenile Court Judges’ Commission 

On July 16, 2022, Robert	J.	Tomassini was appointed 
executive director of the Juvenile Court Judges’ 
Commission (JCJC). 

Mr. Tomassini began his career back in 1987 as a juvenile 
probation officer in Adams County where he was later 
promoted to deputy chief juvenile probation officer in 1991.  

In 2008, Mr. Tomassini was recognized by the JCJC as 
Juvenile Probation Supervisor of the Year and two years 
later, he was promoted to the position of director of juvenile 
probation services in that jurisdiction, where he remained 
until 2013. 

It was then when Mr. Tomassini was hired by the JCJC as 
director of administration and grant programs, overseeing 
the agency’s operating budget as well as management of 
the agency’s Juvenile Probation Services Grant Program, 
which provides nearly $18 million of state funding to 
juvenile probation departments across the commonwealth.

Mr. Tomassini was later promoted to the position of 
director of the JCJC’s Center for Juvenile Justice Training 
and Research (CJJT&R) in 2015 located at Shippensburg 
University of Pennsylvania. 

In 2016, Mr. Tomassini was promoted to the position of 
deputy director of the JCJC. 

In this role, Mr. Tomassini also served as the project 
coordinator of Pennsylvania’s Juvenile Justice System 
Enhancement Strategy (JJSES) – a statewide initiative to 

JCJC Executive Director Robert J. Tomassini

implement evidence-based practices at every stage of the 
juvenile justice process. 

Additionally, Mr. Tomassini currently serves in a leadership 
role with a team of statewide juvenile justice stakeholders 
participating in the Pennsylvania Reducing Racial and 
Ethnic Disparities in Juvenile Justice Certificate Program 
delivered by Georgetown University’s Center for Juvenile 
Justice Reform.

Legislative Roundup by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

As of this writing, the legislature is halfway through its fall 2022 voting session days – the 
House has three and the Senate has six voting days remaining prior to the General Election.
It is expected several pending bills will advance to the governor’s desk during this time.

On Nov. 8, all 203 House seats and 25 Senate seats (even-numbered districts) are on  
the ballot. The current balance of power in the legislature slants heavily to the GOP.  
The Republicans control the House 113-88 (two vacancies) and the Senate 29-21. 

Amendments to Article V (Judiciary)

At least 12 proposed constitutional amendments seeking 
to amend Art. V have been introduced this session. One 
amendment, district elections for appellate court judges, 
passed in the prior legislative session (2019-20). An outside 
possibility exists that this amendment could be considered 
this fall. 

The others – establishing term limits for appellate jurists, 
requiring all jurists to stand for reelection, creating a 
legislative role in procedural rulemaking, requiring the 
election of common pleas president judges in counties 
with three or more judges, establishing appellate court 
merit selection, repealing the judicial compensation 
clause, establishing six-year terms for all jurists, and 
requiring Supreme Court justices to run for reelection 
every four years – have not passed previously nor were 
they considered in enough time this session to meet the 
constitutional deadline for publication three months before 
the next general election. 

Determinate Sentence in Summary  
Traffic Cases

House Bill 521, Senate Bill 1031 and House Bill 2106 allow 
a court to impose a determinate sentence for a summary 
violation under Title 75 when the maximum sentence of 
total confinement imposed is 90 days or less. The bills 
remove current sentencing ranges enumerated in 75 Pa.C.S. 
§ 1543 (driving while operating privilege is suspended or 
revoked). 

Each of the three bills include other provisions in addition 
to the determinate sentencing changes. The bills are at 
various points in the process, with HB 521 the furthest 
along having passed the House 143-58 and reported from 
Senate Transportation 11-3. 

MDJs and Referral to Collection Agencies

Senate Bill 1208 is a reintroduction of previously vetoed 
legislation, Senate Bill 516. The bill amends Title 42, 
prioritizing Crime Victims Act costs in the order of payment 

(continued on page 9)

of monies that remain after restitution is paid. Additionally, 
the bill allows MDJs to turn delinquent accounts over to 
a private collection entity if the defendant fails to appear 
for the hearing. In those circumstances, the defendant 
may request a new hearing, and upon such request, 
collection activities must cease. Collection activities may 
resume if the defendant fails to appear at the new financial 
determination hearing. Finally, the legislation allows for the 
waiver or reduction of fines and costs, except those levied 
pursuant to the Crimes Victim Act, if the defendant is found 
unable to pay. The legislation has passed all chambers and 
is awaiting action by the governor.

Suspension of Operating Privilege

House Bill 987 amends Title 75, requiring PennDOT to 
update driver records to address an active sanction 
imposed for a conviction of any controlled substance 
offense under law, changing the record to indicate the 
active departmental sanction has ended. 

The bill repeals provisions imposing a suspension of 
operating privilege upon receipt of a certified record of 
conviction, adjudication of delinquency or admission into 
a preadjudication program for misrepresentation of age 
to secure liquor or malt or brewed beverages, purchase, 
consumption, possession or transportation of liquor or malt 
or brewed beverages and carrying a false identification 
card. The legislation has passed all chambers and is 
awaiting action by the governor.

(AIPs) in any matter for which counsel has not been 
retained by the AIP, including subsequent proceedings to 
consider, modify or terminate a guardianship.

Additionally, the bill requires petitions seeking to have 
an individual declared incapacitated to include facts 
demonstrating that less restrictive alternatives were 
considered, and reasons why the alternatives were 
insufficient – courts must make specific findings of fact 
as to the insufficiency prior to ordering a guardianship. 
Lastly, the bill mandates certification of individuals 
seeking guardianship of three or more persons. The bill 
was reported unanimously from the Senate Judiciary 
Committee.

Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and 
Visitation

House Bill 2287 amends Titles 23 and 51, repealing current 
provisions governing child custody proceedings during 
military deployment and adding a new chapter, Uniform 
Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation. The legislation 
is based on a model law developed by the Uniform Law 
Commission. Similar laws have been adopted in 16 states. 

Broadly, the bill defines numerous terms, adds subchapters 
governing custodial responsibilities during deployment 
and judicial procedure for granting custodial responsibility 
during deployment. The legislation passed the House 
unanimously and was referred to Senate Judiciary.

Indigent Defense Advisory Committee

Select Committee on Law and Order

Senate Bill 1317 amends the Pennsylvania Commission 
on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD) Law, establishing 
the Indigent Defense Advisory Committee within PCCD 
comprised of five non-voting and 20 voting members. The 
committee consists of ex officio, and members appointed 
by legislative leaders, the governor and the chief justice. 
The seven chief justice appointments include three 
criminal court judges, a county chief public defender from 
recommendations of the Public Defender Association of 
Pennsylvania (PDAP) and three public defenders from 
specific classes of counties from recommendations of 
PDAP. 

The legislation requires the committee to work with the 
AOPC and Juvenile Court Judges’ Commission on data 
requests involving cases involving public defenders. Finally,

PAJIRS 2.0 to Debut in 2023

The Pennsylvania Judicial Security Incident Reporting System (PAJIRS) provides 
judges, court administrators, judicial staff and county sheriffs with the ability to 
advise the AOPC/Office of Judicial District Security of security events occurring 
within Pennsylvania’s 60 judicial districts.

While this innovative application has served Pennsylvania courts for almost 
two decades, AOPC/Judicial District Security is spearheading an initiative to 
enhance technologies that simplify the log-on process, streamline reporting and 
enable greater analytical capabilities of reportable events.  

“The transition to the new PAJIRS 2.0 system will be intuitive for new and 
existing users and enable security incident reporting with unprecedented ease 
and speed to readily report security incidents to the AOPC,” said	Rob	Granzow, 
Judicial District Security administrator.  

Although the product’s official debut is set for January 2023, plans are underway 
to ensure the upcoming transition is well-communicated to Pennsylvania’s 
judicial districts and sheriffs’ offices. 

“While the original PAJIRS application has served the AOPC well since its 
inception in 2005, we are truly excited to provide judicial districts with PAJIRS 
2.0. The new application will implement the same security incident reporting 
system being used by many government agencies across the United States,” 
stated Kyle	Ramberger, Judicial District Security assistant administrator.

“Common Pleas Courts and Sheriffs’ offices will be able to access the reporting 
form by simply clicking on an Incident Reporting icon located on the AOPC/
Judicial District Security’s webpage, while Magisterial District Judges and their 
staff will find the ‘Incident Reporting’ icon on their Magisterial District Judge 
System portal,” added Ramberger.

Addressing 
recruitment and 
retention issues 
in MDJ offices

By Michael	Passiment,  
AOPC Judicial District Operations and 
Programs administrator

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about 
significant changes in how our economy and 
job market function, and employers are finding 
it exceedingly difficult to fill vacant positions as 
prospective employees are being more selective in 
terms of job pay, benefits and perks.

Anticipated retirements are accelerating as well, 
placing a greater impetus on employers to fill the 
talent gap.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
from January 2020 – just prior to the pandemic – to 
January 2022, the government sector lost more 
than 600,000 workers – more than manufacturing, 
wholesale trade and construction combined.

The magisterial district courts in Pennsylvania are 
no stranger to this growing problem. Across the 
commonwealth, court administrators are seeing MDJ 
office staff leave in large numbers.

A common refrain for why staff are heading for the 
exit is low wages. In some counties, MDJ offices 
are competing with private sector businesses who 
can offer a more competitive wage, more flexible 
work hours, and other fringe benefits that the courts 
cannot.

Traditionally, the perception has been that while 
public sector employers tend to offer below-
market compensation, they make up for this with 
job security, a robust retirement plan, great health 
insurance and a sense of public service.

While these values still hold up for some, they are 
being challenged by a younger workforce with 
different values. This younger workforce seeks 
greater flexibility in work environment and structure, 
more opportunities to advance and exercise 
entrepreneurship and employers who promote their 
well-being.

Shelly Forte, director of enterprise recruitment for the Commonwealth of 
Pa., speaking on public sector hiring challenges

employees in the MDJ courts, AOPC/Judicial District Operations 
and Programs recently hosted a Minor Court Administrators’ 
Workshop on Sept. 28-29 in Harrisburg to connect 
administrators with human capital management experts.

Bob Oglesby, Strategic Advisor at NEOGOV, a government 
software solutions company that assists public sector 
organizations in attracting and retaining top talent, presented 
‘The Data You Need to Know – How to Reach, Attract, and 
Retain Talent.’

His presentation gave attendees a comprehensive overview of 
the challenges facing public sector recruiters across the country 
and high-level solutions on how the courts in Pennsylvania 
can try new methods for reaching pools of talent in their 
communities.

NEOGOV conducted extensive surveys with nearly 300 public 
sector HR directors to gather firsthand insight into the hiring 
situation. Some notable results included the following:

• 

• 

83% of respondents identified voluntary turnover as the 
biggest driver of job openings in the public sector

Increased competition in the job market, higher salaries 
elsewhere and remote work/flexible work arrangements 
were the most significant reasons given for this turnover

•  Public sector organizations are contending with significantly 

fewer applicants per job opening, with the number of 
applicants per open job down 56% in the last year for the 
public sector

To assist judicial districts in navigating these 
challenging times for recruiting and retaining 

• 

Lower paying jobs received the biggest drop in applications, 
dropping nearly 40% in the last year

11

(continued on page 12)

• 

The struggle to fill vacant positions is placing greater 
strain on existing employees – 82% of those surveyed 
identified staff burnout as a significant challenge in the 
workplace.

After outlining the hiring crisis in the public sector, Oglesby 
segued into addressing what employers can do to combat 
this difficult job market.

Identifying what motivates workers in the public sector is 
critical to combating the hiring crisis. Surveying showed 
job security, attractive benefits packages and opportunity 
to do meaningful work were the most common motivators. 
These motivators were found equally important in 
retaining existing employees.

Another possible solution to boost employee recruitment 
is to improve the job application process. As Oglesby 
explained, “across all age groups, job seekers find that the 
process for getting a job is too cumbersome and slow.”

Many prospective employees were deterred from pursuing 
employment in some public sector agencies because of the 
negative experience in applying.

He explained that there is plenty of room for improvement 
in how employers facilitate the hiring process, starting 
with the application process. A challenge for employers is 
to make job descriptions clear, concise and responsive to 
those elements that attract job seekers.

Job	advertisements	should	be:

Transparent – communicating expectations, 
processes and outcomes expected of the 
successful job candidate

Open and honest about pay

Include day-to-day information about what 
the job looks and feels like

Job postings should also be seen as promotions or 
advertisements needing to be sold, with top motivators 
evident in the description and the most appealing aspects 
of the job marketed to a rapidly diversifying workforce.

Shelly Forte, director of Enterprise Recruitment with the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, provided an overview 
of public sector hiring challenges here in the Keystone 
State, as well as her department’s efforts to make the 
Commonwealth an employer-of-choice.

12

Forte’s presentation served as a perfect segue into the 
hiring challenges and needs of the county courts.

She identified several challenges in talent management 
in state government, including inconsistent, delayed and 
outdated efforts to reach applicants, a persistent wage gap, 
a restrictive civil service system and a need to create more 
opportunities for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the 
workforce.

Forte explained some of the extensive employee 
recruitment and retention reform efforts that have been 
underway since the start of the Wolf Administration.

Some	innovative	ideas	suggested:

Recruitment videos using real employee 
testimonials

Branding the Commonwealth as an 
employer at high schools, colleges and 
community organizations

Greater usage of professional networking 
sites like LinkedIn, Indeed and Handshake

In addition to these suggestions, workshop attendees 
were provided examples of how to rewrite and promote job 
postings using dynamic and attention-grabbing language.

Workshop attendees expressed great interest in taking 
these ideas back to their judicial districts and several 
expressed their desire to reframe difficult to fill jobs with an 
eye toward what motivates prospective employees.

In the open discussion and peer learning session following 
the speakers, administrators across the state shared 
challenges they saw in their specific districts. While some 
judicial districts had unique challenges, the commonalities 
became abundantly clear.

While these challenges seem intractable, attendees from 
across the commonwealth, as well as AOPC staff, agreed 
that there were many recruitment ideas to take back and 
try in their districts.

As the job market continues to evolve in these uncertain 
times, the camaraderie and professionalism among all in 
attendance offers hope that many possible solutions exist 
to ensuring the courts are staffed and ready to meet the 
needs of their communities.

Lawrence County Treatment Court 
Launches Veterans Treatment Track

Lawrence County recently added a Veterans Treatment 
Track as part of its long-running Treatment Court Program. 

The Veterans Track is a specialized track targeting justice-
involved veterans charged with qualifying offenses who 
may be suffering from addiction, mental health issues and 
other combat-related disorders. 

The new track falls under the existing Treatment Court 
Program and is a partnership between the Court of 
Common Pleas, the Lawrence County District Attorney’s 
office, local defense counsel, Lawrence County 
Adult Probation & Parole, Lawrence County Drug & 
Alcohol Commission, the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Administrations (VA) and the Lawrence County Veterans 
Affairs Office. 

A crucial addition to the partnerships between agencies 
is the relationship between a veteran participant and their 
assigned veteran mentor. These volunteer veterans engage 
and empower the veteran participants to change their lives 
while providing camaraderie and vet-to-vet support, as well 
as assistance navigating through the services available to 
them at the local, state and federal levels.

13

Veterans Treatment Courts and Tracks divert qualified 
cases of justice-involved veterans, offering treatment for 
substance use disorder, mental health conditions and any 
other appropriate services as an alternative to traditional 
prosecution and case disposition. This particular structure 
works closely with the VA, specifically collaborating 
regularly with the Veterans Justice Outreach Coordinator 
to determine appropriate treatment levels as well as other 
services available to address the unique needs of the 
specific individual while protecting public safety concerns. 

The Veterans Track in Lawrence County was established in 
January 2022. Currently, there are four active participants in 
the program at different stages in their journey to recovery 
and stability. 

Nationwide, since 2021 there are 511 active Veterans 
Treatment Courts since the first one launched in Buffalo, 
NY in 2008. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there 
are 25 active Veterans Treatment Courts with a 76% 
successful completion rate. 

Divorce and Children:  
Helping Kids Deal 
with the Effects

Excerpt reprinted with permission from BHS Focus 2022 

How	Divorce	Affects	Children	

Researchers have filled volumes 
studying and analyzing the effect 
of divorce on children. Studies 
examining the children of divorce have 
found that most suffer a sense of loss 
that can manifest in many different 
ways, depending on the children’s 
ages and unique personalities, as well 
as on how parents handle the divorce 
themselves. 

Younger children may regress in 
areas such as sleeping and toilet 
training, or throw more tantrums. 
School-age and teenage children 
may show symptoms of depression, 
rebel against discipline, or change 
their eating and sleeping habits. 
Recent research has shown that 
adult children of divorce have higher 
divorce rates than adults with parents 
in stable marriages -- and even those 
who remain married report they are 
have less trust for their spouses than 
people whose parents have remained 
married. As a parent, you can take an 
active role in easing your children’s 
pain and reducing negative feelings 
and behaviors. 

How	to	Help	Your	Children	
Cope	with	Divorce	

The single most important way 
that you can help your kids during 
a divorce is to have a cooperative 
relationship with your ex and keep 
conflicts to a minimum. Especially if 
your kids are still young, it’s important 
to reassure them repeatedly that 
you both love them, that the divorce 
was not their fault, and that they will 
always have two parents. It’s also 
crucial to provide your kids with the 
practical information they’ll want to 
know, like who will be driving them to 
school and where they will sleep. But 
the proof is in the pudding. To provide 

them with the assurances they 
need, you will have to be a model of 
maturity. Here are some tips on how 
to do this:

Process,	don’t	vent. You don’t 
have to hide the fact that you are 
stressed or that the divorce brings 
up difficult feelings for you. It’s fine 
to talk about those things in general 
ways, without burdening the kids 
with the details. In fact, airing some 
of these feelings and encouraging 
the children to reciprocate by sharing 
their own feelings may help them lose 
some of the fear and anger they may 
harbor about the divorce. Even years 
after the divorce, make sure you are 
available to listen to your kids express 
their feelings whenever they want to 
talk. As they grow and develop, they 
may need new information or want 
to express differing perspectives. 
Depending on their ages and 
personalities, you may need to 
encourage them to continue to talk 
about their feelings about the divorce. 

Keep	children	out	of	the	middle. If 
the children are teens or even adults 
when you divorce, be especially 
careful not to drag them into the 
fray by confiding too many details 
or enlisting them as negotiators in 
your divorce. Be sure to address any 
nagging issues directly with your 
ex-spouse -- either alone or with the 
help of a mediator -- rather than using 
the kids as messengers or sounding 
boards. 

Keep	free	of	venom. Don’t express 
bitterness towards your ex -- and 
don’t in any way imply that your 
former spouse isn’t a good parent or 
that your kids are wrong to want a 
relationship with their other parent. 
Instead, continue to support and 
foster their relationship in every way 
you can so that the kids can be free of 

14

guilt and ambivalence mental health 
conditions. 

Establish	new	traditions. Remember 
that it isn’t only young children who 
may feel a sense of loss around 
holidays and special times. Many 
adult children become angry and 
confused about losing family rituals 
(even if they once groused about 
them). Be flexible in establishing new 
traditions, especially around holidays 
and celebrations of special events, 
such as birthdays. Be sensitive about 
incorporating new individuals into 
family groupings, and look for fun 
activities to help relieve stress and 
encourage building or rebuilding 
relationships. 

Be	vigilant.	Divorce is stressful for 
kids of any age. Even if your child 
has generally had a positive spin on 
things, keep an eye out for rough 
patches. Arrange for counseling or 
encourage your children to seek help 
if you see serious signs of emotional 
fragility. 

If	Your	Children	Are	Young	

If you have young children, your 
post-separation life will involve 
coordination and cooperation as 
parents. It’s a good idea to anticipate 
parenting issues by spelling out 
guidelines and ground rules in a 
written parenting plan that goes 
beyond the cursory custody terms 
that might have been spelled out in 
a divorce agreement. A parenting 
plan for young children of divorcing 
parents can cover: 

• 

• 

• 

responsibility for medical and 
dental care 

the times your children spend 
with each of you 

holiday arrangements 

(continued on page 15)

• 

how to handle schooling, 
discipline, and extracurricular 
activities, and other specific 
issues that likely to come up, 
especially related to child-rearing. 

If	Your	Children	Are	Adults	

Even adult children may face thorny 
issues when parents divorce, 
particularly concerning the changed 
relationship they will have with each 
parent. Just like younger kids, adult 
children often go through a sort of 
grieving process when their parents 
divorce -- complete with anger, 
confusion, and despair.

Foster	sibling	bonding.	One 
unexpected phenomenon related to 
divorce is that it often brings adult 
children emotionally closer to one 
another, even if they were not close 
as younger children. Do what you can 
to foster such relationships -- and 
resist the temptation to view them as 
threatening or divisive. Realize that 
your children, with their shared past 
and experiences, are often natural 
sources of comfort and support for 
one another. 

Encourage	them	to	seek	support	
from	outsiders.	The overwhelming 
emotion adult children report when 

they learn their parents are divorcing 
is loneliness. Support groups in which 
they can talk with those experiencing 
similar feelings may be especially 
helpful in easing this pain. A number 
of such groups operate online.

Civic Engagement and Education 
in Franklin and Fulton Counties

On Sept. 16, 2022, the 39th Judicial District celebrated 
the adoption of the U.S. Constitution and ratification 
of the Bill of Rights in a ceremony at the Franklin 
County Judicial Center. The ceremony was live-
streamed to Fulton County Courthouse as well.

President Judge Shawn	Meyers opened the 
ceremony by welcoming attendees and explaining his 
pursuit of civic engagement and education with the 
citizens of Franklin and Fulton Counties, by holding 
these ceremonies. 

President of Dickinson College, and former federal 
judge John E. Jones III, spoke about the Constitutional 
Convention held by our framers during the summer 
of 1787. He spoke not only of the differing viewpoints, 
but also of the challenges of the blistering summer 
weather, crowded living conditions and perilous travel 
to hold the convention in Philadelphia that summer. 

The achievement of the framers to overcome physical 
and financial hardship and to compromise to create 
our Constitution reminds us that in in today’s climate 
of political polarization the need for civil discourse 
is paramount to preserving our democracy and 
principles of the Constitution.

Staff Appreciation Events

On Oct. 12, the Pennsylvania 
Judicial Center held a staff 
appreciation fun fest event that 
was open to all PJC occupants, as 
well as staff from the Philadelphia 
and Pittsburgh offices. 

After enjoying the food trucks 
and some delicious milkshakes 
from the Dairymen’s Association, 
some employees played outdoor 
games including Jumbo Jenga, 
while others participated in a 
cornhole cornament, chili cookoff 
or pumpkin decorating contest. 

Also present were some sweet 
treats via the candy and caramel 
apple stations, and some free 
therapy in the form of comfort/
service animals visiting from 
Speranza Animal Rescue. 

(continued on page 17)

AOPC/IT in Mechanicsburg also celebrated staff on Sept. 
21 at their Makin’ Waves event with picnic style food, live 
music, bocce ball, ladder golf and the annual cornhole 
cornament.  

Throughout the year, the 10-member organizing 
committee planned activities for the big day and 
organized fundraising events such as raffles, silent 
auctions, bake sales and online cooking classes. 

The morning of the event was quite a sight with over 30 
IT staff working with the organizing committee to setup 
tents and tables. Staff volunteers grilled burgers, veggie 
burgers, bratwursts and hotdogs.

The event gives employees a chance to unwind and 
socialize with coworkers in a relaxed atmosphere. 

A great time was had by all!

Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone 
to Inspire Your Future

By Darren	Breslin, assistant director, AOPC/Judicial Education

Ever since adolescence, I wanted to learn 
the martial arts. As a teen I dabbled, but 
life and work and family took priority. Then, 
somewhere in my forties, I decided to put 
aside insecurity and finally learn. This was 
the same time I took up ballroom dancing, 
but that’s a story for another time!  

The decision to walk through the dojo 
doors wasn’t easy. Everyone inside was 
young and fit and looked both elegant and 
powerful! But in I walked with as much 
confidence I could muster; a decision that 
literally changed and enhanced my life! 

are promoted to a new rank, to hearing the 
gratitude and seeing the tears of delight of 
parents fills me with overwhelming pride 
and joy.

Another source of pride through martial 
arts occurs when I have the opportunity 
to train with and help instruct some 
members of law enforcement. A few of my 
training partners are police, probation and 
corrections officers or have other jobs in 
law enforcement. Occasionally I’ve been 
invited to assist in training law enforcement 
officers in Maryland and Virginia. 

Martial arts has opened up 

many opportunities, introduced 

me to now-cherished friends 

and enabled some of the most 

rewarding and meaningful 

experiences in my life. 

Throughout my journey, I’ve studied several 
martial arts, including kenpo, modern 
arnis, small circle jujitsu and others. I have 
earned first and second dan (degrees of 
black belt) ranks in several of those arts. I 
will be a student for life, but I also teach at 
diverse levels. 

While I love teaching both children and 
adults, helping them grow and realize their 
potential, probably the most rewarding 
teaching experiences are my “kenpo kids” 
classes. 

These classes are given to small groups 
of children and young adults with unique 
needs and/or on the autism spectrum. 
Working with these amazing young men 
and women is simply incredible. In my 
experience, martial arts study in quiet 
focused settings allows these amazing 
individuals to really flourish. Seeing the 
elation on my students’ faces when they 
grasp a move or technique, or when they 

Whenever I have the opportunity to 
train with or help teach these brave 
men and women, I am always aware 
that what I am showing or helping them 
learn may literally save a life someday: 
their own, or someone else’s. 

What a profound and rewarding 
opportunity to help others through 
an art I have learned to relish. I get a 
similarly rewarding experience when 
I can show my friends some simple 
but effective self-defense techniques. 
When this happens, my protective 
nature is sated. I am so grateful knowing 
that sharing my passion may help prevent 
injury or worse.

As I mentioned earlier, the study of martial 
arts has changed my life. Embarking on 
this journey has been one of the most 
meaningful decisions I’ve made. I have 
improved my physical and mental well-
being and learned practical self-defense; I 
have relished in the gratitude from parents 
and peers for teaching; I have enjoyed 
knowing that I help others in achieving 
their martial arts goals; I’ve written on the 
study of martial arts; and, I have taken 
great pride in knowing I may provide 
potentially life-saving self-defense skills to 
many.  

On top of all of this, I have made 
international friendships that I will cherish 
and cultivate for the rest of my days.  I’m 
glad I stepped out of my comfort zone a 
few years ago and enabled this inspired 
future.

Magisterial District Judge Brings 
Courtroom to Local Classrooms

By Katherine Mansfield, Observer-Reporter - Reprinted with permission from the Observer-Reporter

Magisterial District Judge John	
Bruner brought the courtroom to 
fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms 
last week at Trinity South 
Elementary School.

“When I became a magistrate, I 
noticed ... that some of the school 
misbehaviors can lead a student 
into the courtroom. Truancy, 
vaping, underage drinking, 
smoking, bullying, harassment – 
these types of things often ... take 
that child in front of a magistrate 
judge,” said Bruner, who launched 
Classrooms Versus Courtrooms 
earlier this year.

“The purpose of this is to educate 
(students) in their classrooms, 
versus having to officially preside 
over a case in my courtroom. 
Education and prevention is the 
purpose.”

Fifth graders at Trinity South wave their U.S. Constitutions high in the air Sept. 16. Karen 
Huff’s class welcomed Magisterial District Judge John Bruner Friday, and learned about U.S. 
law, the judicial branch, the role of judges and peer pressure. 

Together with principals at 
McGuffey and Trinity school 
districts, Bruner wrote a crash course in U.S. government, 
tailored to students on the cusp of teenage-dom.

Classrooms Versus Courtrooms covers America’s 
beginnings, highlights three important documents that 
serve as our government’s foundation, explores the judicial 
branch and sets the tone for students’ futures.

“I love having the kids realize the founding documents do 
set up everything for daily life,” said fifth-grade teacher 
Karen Huff, whose class welcomed Bruner on Friday. “He 
focused a lot on what they need to know: How to handle 
peer pressure and how that will affect them in their lives.”

Aided by a creative SmartBoard presentation, Bruner 
taught students about the Declaration of Independence, 
the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Huff’s class 
learned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court predates the U.S. 
Constitution; the Constitution was signed in 1787; and the 
Constitution’s birthday is Sept. 17.

“Let’s give a thumbs up to the Constitution,” Bruner said. 
“It’s 235 years old. It’s one of the oldest constitutions in the 
world. A lot of other countries have used our constitution to 
create theirs.”

Bruner also took students on a judicial journey. He 
explained court levels, talked about who judges are and 
what they do, and briefly recounted his own career.

While the Bill of Rights and U.S. law are important subjects, 
the heartbeat of Classrooms Versus Courtrooms is Bruner’s 
candid discussion of impulse control and peer pressure.

“You want to know the secret to life?” Bruner asked a class 
full of attentive Trinity Hillers. “It’s choices. Choices define 
who you are.”

The former police officer engaged students in a game 
of Good Choice, Bad Choice, and explained the role of 
magistrates in bad choices. He talked about truancy, vaping 
and other issues, and why they’re categorized as “bad 
choices.”

“Students can be cited under Pennsylvania law. And I do 
have cases in front of me that involve sixth graders,” Bruner 
said. “Truancy – it’s something that every year, the numbers 
get higher. Staying at home and not wanting to come to 
school ... is not a good idea.”

Neither is vaping, Bruner said, noting the Centers for 
Disease Control labeled teenage vaping a national 
epidemic.

“Being addicted to something is bad 
because you can’t stop when you 
want to stop,” Bruner said. “We want 
to educate you ... so you never start.”

An informal survey revealed Huff’s 
class knows vaping is bad for their 
lungs and finances, and Bruner 
explained it can lead to court 
appearances, community service 
and eight-hour Smokeless Saturday 
classes. Why, then, do children vape?

“Peer pressure,” Bruner said.

He taught students the perils of 
giving in to peer pressure and helped 
them practice saying “No” to things 
they know are bad for their health 
and future. The judge also offered 
alternatives to the high associated 
with drugs: Set and accomplish goals, 
and be kind.

“It’s OK to not care what other people 
think, if you’re making the right 
choice,” he said. “Keep practicing 
saying ‘No!’ to the wrong things.”

The program ended on a light note, 
with volunteers shrugging into judges 

robes. Students inked their names on 
a copy of the U.S. Constitution, flipped 
through booklets containing the full 
text, and recounted the program with 
friends.

It’s good for students to hear that 
from someone other than educators ... 
someone in the community, who can 
really reinforce what we’re saying here 
in school.”

“I learned not to say ‘yes’ to peer 
pressure,” Mackenzie Hull said.

And that’s what Bruner is getting at. 
He said kids who get in trouble grow 
into adults who get in trouble, and he 
hopes to help establish healthy habits 
early. He wants students to know why 
law exists, how the U.S. government 
works and how to set themselves up 
for future success.

“I thought it was a great opportunity 
not only to hear about the judicial 
system and the different levels of 
government, but also on a career 
perspective, on what he does,” said 
Trinity South principal Pete Keruskin, 
who worked with Bruner to bring 
Classrooms Versus Courtrooms to 
the district. “I think students today, 
especially at this level, going in to 
middle school, need to know as you 
grow older, there’s more responsibility. 

Keruskin already plans to invite 
Bruner back next year, and the 
detective-turned-judge looks forward 
to sharing his message often. He 
first presented Classrooms Versus 
Courtrooms to McGuffey elementary 
and middle schoolers in May and 
hopes to bring the program to 
students within his jurisdiction.

Bruner said Classrooms Versus 
Courtrooms is a team effort and, 
ultimately, the goal is to spread 
awareness for the law and encourage 
students to establish healthy habits.

“The fear of feeling lonely is peer 
pressure,” Bruner said. “Sometimes 
doing what is popular isn’t the right 
choice. Saying no to peer pressure 
takes courage.”

New data: Courts cleared more criminal 
cases in 2021 than were filed 

Reprinted with permission from the National Center for State Courts newsletter – @ the Center.

State courts cleared far more criminal 
cases—especially felonies—than 
they received in 2021, according 
to extensive preliminary data 
provided from the case management 
systems of state courts in 19 
states. The data provide insight 
into how courts nationwide have 
successfully prioritized clearing 
criminal dockets that were built 
up in 2020, when public health 
considerations prevented some 
courts from constituting juries and the 
pandemic forced courts to slow some 
proceedings.

The figures come from a just-released 
report from the Court Statistics 
Project, a joint project of NCSC 
and the Conference of State Court 
Administrators, which collects 
comprehensive, aggregate caseload 

data from state courts annually.

Across the 16 states providing 
outgoing caseload data, about 
350,000 more criminal matters were 
resolved in 2021 than were filed that 
same year, reflecting the urgency that 
state court systems have placed on 
upholding the constitutional right to 
a speedy trial. Additionally, courts 
cleared 25% more felony cases and 
9% more misdemeanor cases in 
2021 than in 2020, the year in which 
the pandemic presented the biggest 
challenges to justice systems across 
the country. 

Overall, the number of new court 
filings across the 19 states was down 
24% from the last pre-pandemic year 
of 2019. The number of incoming 
felony cases in 2021 was virtually the 

22

same as in 2019. Interestingly, there 
is little variation in the types of filings 
across the last three years’ worth of 
data. Traffic cases represented 53% 
of all new filings, the exact same 
percentage as in 2019. Meanwhile, 
civil cases constituted 19% of all 
filings in each of 2019, 2020, and 
2021, though there were one million 
fewer contracts cases filed in 2021 
compared to 2019. The figures also 
reveal that only one case type—
probate and estate cases—saw more 
new filings in 2021 than in 2019.

The 19 states reporting include many 
of the nation’s largest—including 
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
and Texas—and account for nearly 
40% of the total population. Complete 
reporting on all 2021 data will be 
released later this year.
