Record Retention Schedule and Guidelines – Program 

1. Record Retention Program 

1.1 Background 

Pennsylvania Rule of Judicial Administration No. 507 establishes three categories of offices for 
purposes of record retention and disposition: 1) offices scheduled by the County Records 
Committee (that must dispose of records in conformity with the applicable retention schedules 
established by the Committee)1; 2) offices scheduled by the Supreme Court (that must dispose of 
records in conformity with the applicable retention schedules established by the Supreme Court)2; 
and 3) non-scheduled offices (that can only dispose of records upon request to the Pennsylvania 
Historical and Museum Commission [PHMC] and the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania 
Courts [AOPC] and with approval by the AOPC)3. 

The record retention and disposition schedules set forth hereunder have been adopted by the 
Supreme Court. This document contains guidelines and procedures for storing and archiving 
records, as well as the disposal of both permanent and non-permanent records. 

1.2 Definitions 

Court Records - “Court records” are those papers, dockets, books, photographs, or other 
documentary materials in any form made or received in a Judicial District pursuant to law, 
statute, or rules of court, in connection with transactions of its business and the discharge of its 
responsibilities. 

Permanent Records - “Permanent records” are those which may not be destroyed. Permanent 
records may, however, be disposed if they are replicated as required by the applicable schedules 
adopted by the Supreme Court, and provided that prior approval has been received from the 
AOPC. (See §2.2 Disposal Request Procedure – Permanent Records) 

Non-permanent Records - “Non-permanent records” are those records which need to be 
retained for a specified period of time and which may be disposed without prior approval upon 
expiration of the retention period provided in the applicable record retention schedule,. These 
records must be listed in the appropriate Records Disposal Log which must be filed with the 
AOPC on an annual basis, as further set forth herein. (See  §2.3 Disposal Request Procedure & 
Log – Non-Permanent Records) 

Electronic Records - “Electronic records” include numeric, graphic, and text information which may be 
recorded on any medium capable of being read by a computer and which satisfies the definition of a record 
as defined in §1.2 Definitions. This includes, but is not limited to: magnetic media such as computer tapes, 
disks, optical disks, diskettes and other electronic storage devices and electronic filing systems containing 
records. These requirements apply to all electronic records systems, whether microcomputers, 
minicomputers or main-frame computers, in network or stand-alone configurations. (See §3. Microfilm and 
Electronic Archival Systems) 
Records not subject to retention - “Records not subject to retention” are those records which

Record Retention Schedule and Guidelines – Program 

need not be maintained permanently or for a specified period of time, and which may be used by 
system and related personnel of the Unified Judicial System as unofficial in-house working papers, 
reference and drafts. No approval is required to dispose of these records. 

Unscheduled Records – Questions concerning retention periods for records not included in this 
schedule, or, for records created subsequent to the adoption of this schedule, should be directed 
to the AOPC. 

1.3 Application of the Schedules 

This document sets forth schedules and guidelines for records that are being used by personnel 
of the Unified Judicial System and related staff that support the courts of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania, but not records maintained by county officers which are set forth in the County 
Records Manual. 

These schedules and guidelines are intended to supplant existing practices for the retention and 
disposition of permanent and non-permanent records and to help officials responsible for record 
disposition proceed consistently throughout the Unified Judicial System of the Commonwealth. It 
is recognized that the same type of record may be under the control of different offices or 
personnel in the various Judicial Districts. Nonetheless, the retention period of the record remains 
the same, although the office or personnel charged with the responsibility of retaining or 
disposing of the record may vary. 

1.3.1 Conflict With Other Retention Schedules 
These schedules are intended to be consistent with those set forth in the County Records Manual. 
However, if conflicts arise, this schedule shall govern. 

1.4 Mandatory Minimum Retention Periods 

The record retention periods set forth herein are minimum terms for the retention of the 
respective files after which the files may be disposed. While the files may be destroyed – in 
accordance with the conditions and procedures contained herein – they may also be retained for 
longer than the established retention periods. Those decisions are best left to court records 
management officials and their leaders. The District Record Retention Officer – as further defined 
in §2.1 below – will be available to provide information and guidance as necessary. 

Absent good cause to the contrary, personnel should dispose of files in conformity with the minimum 
standards in the schedules. The retention periods have undergone considerable scrutiny, both in terms 
of practicality and for conformance with legally accepted standards from many sources. 

1.4.1 Identification of Records 
The ability to dispose of records in an efficient and responsible manner is dependent upon the 
reliable identification of the records in question. Therefore, officials, when storing records subject 
to these retention schedules, should do so in a manner that clearly sets forth the materials 
contained in the files under consideration. Information may include such elements as the date the 
record was created, the subject matter, record type (i.e., presentence reports, notes of testimony, 
etc.), and scheduled destruction date.

1.5 Effective Date 

This Record Retention Schedule shall become effective as provided by the Supreme Court.

2. Record Disposal and Retention Procedures 

Record Retention and Disposition Schedule – Program 

No permanent or non-permanent record may be disposed unless in compliance with the 
procedure set forth in this Schedule. 

2.1 Central Point of Contact for Record Retention 

As a central point of contact, a “Record Retention Officer”, designated by the District Court 
Administrator with the approval of the President Judge, will coordinate the disposition of 
records within each Judicial District. No records may be destroyed without the approval of the 
Record Retention Officer. 

2.2 Disposal Request Procedure: Permanent Records 

Within each District, the record custodian (or person making the disposal request) must submit 
requests to destroy or transfer permanent records to the Record Retention Officer utilizing a 
Unified Judicial System Scheduled Court Records Disposal Certification Request form adopted by 
the AOPC pursuant to Pa. R.J.A. 507(b). The Record Retention Officer shall review the form for 
completeness and ascertain and certify in writing that the records to be destroyed have been 
replicated on a medium approved by the Supreme Court, (See §6 Retention Forms) and must 
forward the original form to the AOPC at such location as may be provided from time to time. A 
copy of each request form must be retained by the Record Retention Officer for the District. The 
AOPC shall review the Disposal Certification Request and shall forward same to the PHMC in the 
event an advisory opinion is deemed necessary, or, if not, shall approve or deny the request. The 
AOPC will return a copy of the request form reflecting the decision to authorize or deny the 
request. If the request is authorized, the specified record(s) may be destroyed or transferred to the 
PHMC, as specifically provided in the form. No permanent records may be destroyed or 
transferred unless the request form with the authorization from the AOPC has been received by the 
Record Retention Officer. The form must be retained permanently. 

The following procedure must be followed: 

1. 
2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Permanent records must not be destroyed without approval of the AOPC. 
Requests for the destruction of permanent records will be submitted by the records 
custodian to the Record Retention Officer utilizing a form approved by the AOPC 
pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 507(b). 
The Record Retention Officer will review the request form to verify that the records in 
question are permanent records and confirm in writing that those records have been 
transferred to an acceptable medium (See §6 Retention Forms). Only then will the Record 
Retention Officer forward the request to the AOPC. Where records have been transferred 
to microfilm format, the standards and quality control measures set forth in the County 
Records Manual shall apply (See County Records Manual at page 1-MF-1). 
Upon receipt of the Disposal Certification Request form, AOPC shall determine whether 
an advisory opinion should be solicited from the PHMC. If so, the AOPC shall forward a 
copy of the form to the PHMC for review, and shall consider the recommendation of the 
PHMC in deciding whether to grant or deny the request. If an advisory opinion is not 
deemed necessary, the AOPC shall determine whether to grant the request based upon a 
review of the form. Upon determination, the AOPC shall send a copy to the Record 
Retention Officer. When the Record Retention Officer receives the written response from 
the AOPC, a copy shall be sent to the record custodian of the unit that requested leave to 
destroy the records, with instructions for their disposal. 
No permanent record may be destroyed without having complied with the specific 

Record Retention Program Page 4 

Record Retention and Disposition Schedule – Program 

direction set forth by the AOPC at the time permission to destroy the permanent record 
is granted. 

2.3 Disposal Request Procedure & Log: Non-permanent 
Records 

A request to destroy non-permanent scheduled records must be submitted by the record custodian 
requesting permission to dispose of the record(s) to the Record Retention Officer utilizing a 
Unified Judicial System Disposal Log for Non-Permanent Records form adopted by the AOPC as 
provided in Pa.R.J.A. No. 507. The Record Retention Officer shall review the Records Disposal 
Log Form for completeness and shall grant written permission to dispose of such non-permanent 
records upon ascertaining that the applicable retention period as set forth in the schedule has been 
met. Written approval from the AOPC is not necessary before destroying non-permanent records 
as identified in the schedule. A log of individual disposition actions involving non-permanent 
records must be maintained. Copies of the Records Disposal Log Form shall be submitted on an 
annual basis to the AOPC. (See  §4.5 Form Retention) 

The following procedure must be followed: 

1. 

2. 

3. 
4. 

The record custodian seeking permission to dispose of the record shall complete a Record 
Disposal Log Form for records designated for destruction pursuant to the appropriate 
schedule, and shall submit the form to the Record Retention Officer for review and 
approval. (See §6. Retention Forms at the end of this document) 
The Record Retention Officer will indicate approval or disapproval in the provided 
place(s), and return a copy to the individual submitting the destruction request. The 
original Records Disposal Log Form will be retained by the Record Retention Officer. 
If approved, the records listed on the log form may then be destroyed. 
No later than January 31st of every year, the Record Retention Officer will forward to the 
AOPC a copy of the log forms listing the records that have been disposed during the 
previous year. 

2.4 Destruction Hold Procedures 

2.4.1 Matters In Litigation 
Notwithstanding the disposition schedules set forth herein, no record which is otherwise eligible for 
disposition shall be destroyed if the District becomes aware that the record may be needed for 
pending litigation. District Court Administrators or their designees, upon having the knowledge or 
belief of actual or impending litigation requiring the preservation of certain records, shall 
immediately so notify in writing the Record Retention Officer, and appropriate deputies or other 
staff, to ensure the preservation of the subject records, as well as suspending any destruction or 
transfer activities. Such records shall be retained until all related proceedings have been concluded 
or until such time as, in the written opinion of counsel for the District or the AOPC, the threat of 
litigation has been removed. (See also §4.9 Litigation: Judicial Districts and Employees) 

2.4.2 Matters Pending Audit 
Records subject to audit must be retained for the periods listed in the schedule and must be audited 
and all findings resolved before such records may be destroyed. Applicable Federal and State 
statutes and administrative regulations may necessitate retaining records for a longer period of 
time than indicated in the schedule. Information on specific program regulations should be 
obtained from the appropriate administering/funding/licensing agency. 

Record Retention Program Page 5 

Record Retention and Disposition Schedule – Program 

2.5 Methods of Record Destruction 

2.5.1 Confidential Records 
Where confidential information may be contained in the records, shredding is the preferred method 
of destruction. Otherwise, records may be incinerated under the direct supervision of the District. 

2.5.2 Non-Confidential Records 
Records that do not contain confidential information may be shredded, incinerated, or 
otherwise disposed according to general practice. 

Records stored at vendor sites designated for record storage, maintenance, and disposition may be 
destroyed under the supervision of the vendor with written confirmation from the vendor that the 
records have been disposed. 

2.6 Liability of Record Retention Officer and System 
and Related Personnel. 

Record retention officers and/or system and related personnel involved in record retention and 
disposal duties shall be immune from all civil liability that may be related to records management 
practices provided that the disposition of records is accomplished in accordance with the terms of 
the within schedule, and any amendment thereto.4 

2.7 Disposal Request Procedure: Damaged Records 
Records are to be maintained at such appropriate locations as to minimize their potential loss or 
damage. It is crucial that Districts periodically undertake risk assessments of the conditions under 
which records are stored, and take appropriate steps to mitigate the threat of damage. Extensive 
information on Disaster Planning and Vital Records protection is provided by the Pennsylvania 
Historical Commission on its website, at http://www.phmc.state.pa.us (see Records Management, 
State Government Services, Disaster Planning & Vital Records; and Local Government/Judicial 
System Services, Disaster Planning & Vital Records Management). All Record Retention Officers 
are encouraged to take advantage of the information provided, which includes generic templates for 
the establishment of Disaster Response and Recovery Plans. 

Despite periodic risk assessments, some records may be damaged before the expiration of their 
retention period by unforeseeable natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, fires, or other 
causes. When records are damaged, an assessment must be immediately conducted to determine 
the potential for their recovery. Districts should attempt to salvage and preserve all damaged 
records whenever possible. Only after an appropriate determination has been made that the 
damaged records cannot be salvaged or restored should their disposal be requested. Of course, 
records that are beyond their mandatory minimum retention period and have no administrative, 
legal or historical value may be destroyed without approval from the AOPC, provided, 
however, that the protocol established in Section 2.3 is followed. 

The request to dispose of damaged records must be made by the District Court Administrator, after 
consultation with the official responsible for the records and the Record Retention Officer and at the 
conclusion of the evaluation process necessary to determine the salvageability of the damaged 
records. The District Court Administrator must personally view all records whose disposal is 

4Patterned after the County Records Act, which provides that “No County officer shall be held liable on his official bond or in any way, either 
civil or criminal, because of the disposition of records, provided he disposes of the records in accordance with the schedules adopted by the 
committee.” Act No. 407, August 14, 1963, as amended. See 16 P.S. § 13005 

Record Retention Program Page 6 

Record Retention and Disposition Schedule – Program 

sought, and must attach photographs and other appropriate description of the damage and 
justification for the request to dispose of the records. 

The District must consider the following factors in determining that the records cannot be salvaged 
and must be destroyed: whether the records are permanent or non-permanent; whether the records 
are subject to audit, and if so, whether an audit has been completed; whether the records can be 
salvaged by ordinary methods such as air drying; whether the records may be salvaged by 
extraordinary means such as retaining an expert in record reconstruction; whether the damaged 
records pose a health risk in their continued storage; whether any movement of the damaged 
records can be safely made; whether the cost of restoring the record exceeds its value, 
administrative, historical, or otherwise. 

In the event the damaged records whose destruction is being sought are subject to an audit, and 
copies of the damaged records are not available, the official responsible for the records shall notify 
the auditing entity, as soon as practicable, that the specified records were damaged, describe the 
nature of the damage, and represent that on a date certain a Unified Judicial System Record 
Disposal Certification Request - Damaged Records form will be submitted to the Administrative 
Office of Pennsylvania Courts seeking permission to destroy the damaged records unless the 
auditing entity requests, before the submission date, a reasonable delay in seeking destruction of the 
damaged records. Information concerning the notice provided (date, name of auditing entity and 
address) as well as responses, if any, will be entered on the Unified Judicial System Record 
Disposal Certification Request - Damaged Records form. Of course, no notification need be made if 
a copy of the records exists, if the damaged records were audited, or are not subject to an audit. 

A Unified Judicial System Record Disposal Certification Request - Damaged Records form must 
be submitted by the District Court Administrator to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania 
Courts, at such location as may be provided from time to time. In order to expedite the approval 
process where public health and safety concerns are present, the Record Disposal Certification 
Request form should be submitted by electronic mail or fax. The AOPC will return a copy of the 
request form reflecting the decision to authorize or deny the request. If the request is authorized, 
the specified damaged record(s) may be destroyed 

The following procedure must be followed to seek permission to dispose of Damaged Records: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The official responsible for maintaining the records must notify the Record 
Retention Officer and District Court Administrator immediately upon ascertaining 
that records which are subject to a Record Retention Schedule have been damaged. 
The Record Retention Officer will immediately conduct a personal inspection of the 
damaged records. In the event the Record Retention Officer is of the opinion that the 
damaged records may not be salvageable, the Record Retention Officer must inform 
the District Court Administrator. 
The District Court Administrator will direct the Record Retention Officer and official 
responsible for the records to conduct an appropriate evaluation of the options available 
to restore the damaged records and will request the preparation of a comprehensive 
report detailing the available options, if any. The Report should include photographs or 
other representations of the current condition of the damaged records. 
If the Report issued by the Record Retention Officer and official responsible for the 
records reveals that the damaged records cannot be safely salvaged, the District Court 
Administrator shall personally review the damaged records and, if he/she is in 
agreement with the Report, shall complete a Unified Judicial System Record Disposal 
Certification Request - Damaged Records form and forward it to the Administrative 
Office of Pennsylvania Courts. 

5. 

The damaged records must be maintained until such time as the District Court

the damaged records.

3. Microfilm and Electronic Archival Systems 

Record Retention and Disposition Schedule – Program 

The last several years have seen the introduction of numerous technologies with indications that 
they may have the potential to change traditional archiving practices. Magnetic tape, optical disk 
and CD Rom have caused the use of microfilm as the sole method of non-paper archiving to be 
questioned by some. However, officials are cautioned that the decision to utilize archiving media 
other than microfilm requires implementation of policies and practices to ensure that the 
integrity of the data is maintained and that the ability to extract the data in a human readable 
format is present for the entire retention period. Therefore, all records stored in any electronic 
manner, including but not limited to Magnetic Tape, Optical Disk or CD Rom, must be refreshed 
or migrated at intervals not exceeding eight years. Additionally, under no circumstances are 
computer hard drives or disks running on direct access storage devices to be used for archiving 
purposes as these devices are subject to periodic failure. 

When considering the preservation of documents having a retention period in excess of twenty-
five years, it is recommended that the conservative microfilm method be utilized. The 
microfilming standards and quality control guidelines contained in the County Records Manual 
are adopted herein. That manual also contains guidelines concerning the retention and disposition 
of records onto optical imaging and storage systems. These also are hereby adopted, with the 
exception of §8(d)(iii) and §8(d)(iv). 

Paper documents with less than a twenty-five year retention period and all documents originating 
electronically such as indices and dockets may be archived using media other than microfilm 
provided the refresh/migrate safeguards noted above are followed. Used within the context of this 
Schedule, the following definitions shall apply: 

Refresh - To move data/images from one medium to the same medium (i.e., tape to tape). This 
requires an analysis of the medium and the associated software and hardware to determine its 
viability for the next eight years. 

Migrate - To move data/images from one medium to a new medium (i.e., tape to CD Rom) one 
software program to a current version or another program and/or from one hardware platform to 
a new hardware platform. 

Retention periods that govern files in paper form also govern records in electronic form. (See §1.2 
Definitions, Electronic Records)

office.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
