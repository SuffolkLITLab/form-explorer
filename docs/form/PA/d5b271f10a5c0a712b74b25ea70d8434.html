The House and Senate returned to session in September. Each chamber is scheduled for 
12 additional voting session days this fall.

Judicial Ethical Rules
Judicial Ethical Rules

House Resolution 114 urges the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court to modify or adopt rules to require the posting of 
statements of financial interest on a publicly accessible 
Internet website, codify more restrictive policies on the 
reporting gifts, transportation, lodging and hospitality, 
impose a one-year prohibition on attorneys leaving 
government service and lobbying the governmental body 
with which the attorney had been associated and end the 
practice of judges and justices receiving honoraria. 

The resolution includes a general request that the 
Court conduct a full examination of ethical and financial 
reporting requirements for jurists and staff to determine 
whether additional amendments would promote greater 
transparency and avoid impropriety and the appearance 
thereof. The resolution was referred to the House 
State Government Committee and re-referred to the 
Subcommittee on Campaign Finance and Elections.

The Subcommittee on Campaign Finance and Elections of 
the House State Government Committee held a hearing 
on a package of bills dealing with lobbying reform and 
disclosure. The resolution was reported unanimously from 
committee to the floor. 

is alleged to be unconstitutional. Achieving special 
standing to intervene as a party requires action of the 
Senate Committee on Management Operations and/
or the House Bi-partisan Management Committee. The 
legislation passed the House 113-86. Referred to the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. 

Kayden’s Law and Custody
Kayden’s Law and Custody

Senate Bill 78 establishes Kayden’s Law, comprehensive 
changes to the custody statute focusing on the health 
and safety of the child. The legislation defines a number 
of new terms, requires courts to consider party criminal 
charges and convictions, child abuse and involvement 
with protective services in custody decisions, modifies the 
custody factors and defines what circumstances dictate 
the order of nonprofessional or professional supervised 
custody. 

The bill codifies that no single custody factor may by 
itself be determinative in awarding custody. Courts must 
examine the totality of the circumstances, giving weighted 
consideration to the factors that impact the health and 
safety of the child, when issuing a custody order that is 
in the best interest of the child. Also, criminal convictions 
cannot by themselves be determinative in the awarding of 
custody. 

Legislative Standing 
Legislative Standing

House Bill 1196 provides either or both chambers of the 
General Assembly with special standing to intervene 
as a party in an action and to defend the act in judicial 
proceedings in which all or part of a legislative enactment 

Finally, the bill allows the AOPC to develop and implement 
an ongoing education and training program for judges, 
MDJs and relevant court personnel, including guardians 
ad litem, counsel for children, masters and mediators 
regarding child abuse. The education and training program 

2

must include all aspects of the maltreatment of children, 
including sexual and physical abuse, implicit and explicit 
bias, trauma and neglect and the impact of child abuse 
and domestic violence on children and include the latest 
best practices from evidence-based and peer-reviewed 
research by recognized experts in the specific types of 
abuse. 

The legislation passed the Senate 46-4 and was referred 
to the House Judiciary Committee. The Subcommittee 
on Family Law of the Judiciary Committee will conduct a 
public hearing on the bill on November 15. 

Right to Know Law – Exempt Information
Right to Know Law – Exempt Information

Senate Bill 745 adds birth date to the list of personal 
information that is exempt from access by a requester. 
The bill was reported from the Senate State Government 
Committee 10-1 and is pending on the Senate floor. 

Constitutional Amendments
Constitutional Amendments

Constitutional amendments are introduced as joint 
resolutions that must be passed in successive legislative 
sessions and then submitted to the voters for approval. 

Election Code 
Election Code

Voter ID and Other Qualifications 
Voter ID and Other Qualifications

House Bill 1800 provides for comprehensive voting process 
and procedure changes. Broadly, the topics include early 
voting, supervised absentee voting, ballot curing, number 
of ballots required at each polling place, voter ID, drop 
boxes, signature matching, access to pre- and canvassing 
meetings, elimination of third-party voter registration 
programs, registration and ballot deadlines and the 
creation of the Bureau of Election Audits. 

Two additional provisions are of note to the judiciary. 
First, similar to House Bill 1196, the legislation provides 
for special legislative standing for each chamber of the 
General Assembly to intervene in proceedings alleging 
that a portion of the act is unconstitutional. Second, 
the bill requires county boards of election to enter into 
agreements with the Unified Judicial System to receive 
records of county residents who claim ineligibility for 
service as a juror under 42 Pa.C.S. § 4502 to investigate 
the registration status of any registered elector who 
claimed ineligibility to serve as a juror on the basis of a 
lack of citizenship. The legislation was reported from the 
House State Government Committee 15-10 and is tabled.

District Attorney (DA) Law Licenses
District Attorney (DA) Law Licenses

Senate Bill 420 adds to the qualifications of DAs that the 
individual must continually hold an active law license 
during the period he/she is in office and establishes 
a process for when a DA is disbarred or suspended. If 
disbarred, the office is considered vacant and the vacancy 
must be filled pursuant to the provisions of the County 
or Second-Class County Code, or for a county of the first 
class, pursuant to Act 385 of 1850. 

Notwithstanding the class of county, if a DA’s license is 
suspended, the DA is suspended from the office until 
the sooner of the license being reinstated or the term 
expiration. If the first assistant DA is willing, qualified 
and able, he/she shall act as the DA. If not, the court of 
common pleas appoints a competent person satisfying 
the requirements. The legislation passed the Senate and 
House unanimously and the Senate concurred in House 
amendments. The bill now goes to the governor. 

House Bill 1596 requires the presentation of a valid 
government issued ID for in-person voting and proof of 
valid government issued ID and a signature for matching 
purposes for mail voting. The amendment removes current 
constitutional language that allows for the enactment 
of uniform laws regulating and requiring the registration 
of electors that apply to cities of the same class. The 
amendment provides for audits of each election by the 
auditor general and provides for the statewide election of 
the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The bill was reported 
from the House State Government Committee 15-10 and is 
pending on the House floor. Prior passage – none. 

Senate Bill 735 requires qualified electors voting in person 
to present a valid ID to receive a ballot and requires 
qualified electors not voting in person to provide proof of 
a valid ID with his or her ballot. The amendment defines 
valid ID as any valid government-issued ID, unless 
otherwise provided by law. The legislation passed the 
Senate 30-20 and referred to the House State Government 
Committee. Prior passage – none. 

Advertising entity 
Advertising entity 

House Bill 1010 replaces the Secretary of the 
Commonwealth with the Legislative Reference Bureau 
(LRB) or a successor legislative agency as the entity 
responsible for publishing constitutional amendments. 
The bill requires that the second publication of 
proposed amendments include only the language of the 
amendment, the ballot question to be used and a summary 
of the amendment as prepared by the LRB or successor 
agency. The legislation passed House 113-88, was 
reported from the Senate State Government Committee by 
a vote of 7-4 and is pending in the Senate Appropriations 
Committee.

Clean Slate 2.0

In the summer of 2019, AOPC/IT began 
automatically identifying and marking 
certain cases as limited access in the 
statewide case management systems 
based on Act 56 of 2018 – known as 
the Clean Slate Act.  

The goal of this Act is to remove 
from all forms of public view any 
information regarding offenses with a 
non-conviction disposition, as well as 
certain low level, older misdemeanor 
and summary offenses which resulted 
in a conviction, provided the court 
assessments on the case are paid in 
full.  

Given the positive reactions to the 
Clean Slate initiative, legislators 
sought to broaden the rules and allow 
even more cases to be eligible. 

At the end of October 2020, Act 83 of 
2020, or Clean Slate II, was passed 
and AOPC/IT immediately began 
working on implementation. 

This Act expanded the category of 
eligible cases to include pardoned 
offenses and reduced the financial 
eligibility requirements for those 
with convictions to satisfy any court-
ordered restitution and statutorily 
mandated fee authorized to carry out 
Clean Slate. 

Likewise, the financial requirement 
for non-convictions is reduced to only 
satisfying restitution to be eligible for 
Clean Slate. 

Over the course of 
10 months, AOPC/IT 
sealed over 46 million 
offenses across 33 
million cases,  
and to date that 
number has risen to 
over 51 million offenses. 

Design and development for Clean 
Slate II continued through the spring 
of 2021, and testing was successfully 
completed over the summer.

During that time, the IT staff worked 
closely with the Pennsylvania Board 
of Pardons to design a mechanism for 
the Board to provide the AOPC with 
the information needed to identify 
pardoned cases and include them in 
the monthly Clean Slate process.  

The initial run of the expanded 
rules for Clean Slate II took place in 
September and included over nine 
million additional offenses that will 
become sealed once the county 
judges sign the orders in October.

Pa. judges welcome kids back to school

This fall, nearly 100 judges statewide volunteered to 
partner with local school districts and welcome students 
back for the 2021-22 school year. 

“The last few school years have been hard on teachers 
and students amid the ongoing pandemic,” said Pa. 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Max Baer
the courts’ mission is to educate all Pennsylvanians about 
the work and role of the courts in our communities.”

“Pennsylvania judges are part of the communities in which 
kids live and go to school. With the pandemic still front-of-
mind for students and educators, it was important for us to 
join with the schools so children can see judges at work in 
the community as they head back to the classroom.” 

Following all individual school district COVID safety 
protocols, judges across the state participated in first 
day of school and other welcome events, standing with 
teachers and administrators to welcome kids as they 
exited the buses and entered school buildings for the first 
time this year. 

The back-to-school events are the first of several planned 
initiatives to increase public awareness about the work 
and role of the courts in the lives of Pennsylvania citizens 
and its communities.

Jefferson County judge and court staff save employee’s life 

A scene in May at the Jefferson County Courthouse could 
have been dire if not for the quick action of President Judge 
John Foradora and other courthouse employees. 
John Foradora

First Deputy Jennifer Shaffer sustained a life-threatening 
injury at the county courthouse when she fell down the 
stairs of the courthouse and cut her arm on a glass dish she 
had in her bag, resulting in a cut to an artery on her arm. 

Immediately and without question, her co-workers took 
action to call for help and render medical aid. 

Sharon Griffin started to make a tourniquet for her when 
President Judge John Foradora arrived to assist and help 
make it tighter to stop the bleeding.

“As employees of the courts, we are in a unique position 
to help people on a daily basis with legal problems,” said 
PJ Foradora. “I definitely thank God that we were able to 

do everything correct when confronted with a real medical 
emergency.”

An ambulance arrived less than 20 minutes after the 
incident and Shaffer was rushed into surgery. 

Thanks to the heroism of her co-workers, Shaffer was able 
to watch her son graduate from high school the following 
week. 

In August, the American Red Cross held a special ceremony 
presenting Certificates of Extraordinary Personal Action to 
the courthouse employees involved in the incident for their 
life-saving response. 

Certificates were presented to PJ Foradora, Sergeant Levi 
Campbell, Jennifer Shaffer, Deputy Dean Smith, Sharon 
Griffin and Peggy Smith.

Franklin County Courts – 
new and improved

Over the course of the last two years, the Franklin County 
Court Facility Improvement Project has been underway – 
with steadily-progressing renovations offering increased 
security, space and convenience for all court users. 

The multi-faceted project includes the construction of 
a new judicial center and administration building, an 
archives facility, and renovations to the historic courthouse 
and courthouse annex.

“The new judicial center will provide an improved 
experience for litigants, counsel, court staff and the 
judiciary on a day-to-day basis,” said Franklin County 
President Judge Shawn Meyers

Shawn Meyers. 

“Compared to existing facilities, the new judicial center not 
only has courtrooms that can accommodate the needs of 
the disabled, at the encouragement of the judiciary, it also 
has a significant number of conference rooms and places 
for counsel to privately confer with clients, which assists in 
the orderly processing of cases.”

“The new facility also provides safety enhancements 
that in conjunction with the hard work of the Sheriff’s 

Department will allow all who appear in court to do so in a 
safe environment.” 

Since the last major expansion of court facilities over 
40 years ago, Franklin County has seen a 37 percent 
population increase and has added three judges with 
related support staff. 

Prior to this project, court-related offices were fragmented 
and spread out around Chambersburg at seven different 
locations. 

The consolidation of most of these operations to one 
convenient downtown campus is expected to increase 
accessibility and reduce overall expenses. 

First approved in 2018, the project officially began with the 
groundbreaking at the old courthouse in October 2019.

The archives facility was finished first in October 2019 and 
the administration building construction was completed in 
February 2021. The new judicial center opened at the end 
of September and the historic courthouse renovations are 
on track to be completed in January 2022.

Veteran Mentors Bootcamp 

Justice for Vets 
Justice for Vets 

In August, AOPC Problem-Solving 
Courts provided 23 scholarships 
to Veteran Treatment Court (VTC) 
team members to attend the 2021 
National Association of Drug Court 
Professionals Conference in National 
Harbor, MD.  

During the conference, Justice for Vets 
provided both a Mentor Coordinator 
Training and a Mentor Corps Boot 
Camp. Of the scholarship recipients, 
Lackawanna County VTC Mentor 
Coordinator James McHugh and 
Mentor George Wright and Lycoming 
County Veteran Mentor Coordinator 
Mike McMunn attended the trainings.  

During the boot camp, volunteer 
veterans learned how to effectively 
mentor veteran participants with 
coursework that examined the roles, 
responsibilities and boundaries of 
veteran mentors, unique issues and 
how to swiftly connect veterans to 
local, state and federal services and 
benefits.

Boot camp sessions included an 
overview of VTCs, mentor-mentee 
relationships, active listening skills, 

boundaries, suicide prevention, 
mentor self-care and building veteran 
community coalitions. 

“Veteran mentors play a critical role in 
veterans treatment courts by offering 
support, encouragement and guidance 
to their fellow veterans.  They 
exemplify the phrase ‘Leave no one 
behind’,” said Problem-Solving Court 
Administrator Angela Lowry

Angela Lowry. 

The mentor coordinator training was 
offered to VTC mentor coordinators, 
who are typically volunteers 
that oversee the matching of 
veteran mentors and participants 
in a VTC. The training provided a 
foundational understanding of the 
role and responsibilities of the mentor 
coordinator position. 

A division of the National 

Association of Drug Court 

Professionals, Justice for Vets 

is dedicated to transforming 

the way the justice system 

identifies, assesses and treats 

veterans. Since 2010, Justice 

For Vets has helped establish 

over 250 veterans treatment 

courts and trained over 3,000 

court staff. In addition, Justice 

For Vets has conducted 40 

volunteer veteran mentor 

boot camp trainings, serving 

thousands of veteran mentors.

Sessions specifically focused on the 
building, executing and sustaining of 
the mentoring component in a VTC 
program; communicating effectively 
with mentors; the mentor coordinator/
program coordinator partnership; 
and community connection through 
networking.

New leadership in SCJAP and PACM

The Special Court Judges Association of Pennsylvania 
(SCJAP) and the Pennsylvania Association of Court 
Management (PACM) recently announced new leadership. 
Susan 
Somerset County Magisterial District Judge Susan 
Mankamyer
Mankamyer is serving as the new president of SCJAP and 
Franklin County District Court Administrator Mark Singer
the president of PACM. 

Mark Singer as 

Judge Mankamyer has been a Magisterial District Judge 
in Somerset County for 16 years and became an active 
member of the SCJAP soon after taking the bench, serving 
in various capacities including assistant webmaster and 
a member of the publications, court administration and 
computer/technical committees. 

“Being an active member of the SCJAP has allowed me to 
interact with other judges from across the state, resulting 
in the exchange of valuable information on processes and 
procedures for the improvement of all our court systems,” 
Mankamyer said.

Reflecting on the important role the SCJAP plays in the 
work and the role of the courts Mankamyer said:

“The association provides an invaluable network of 
information to assist us in our daily lives on the bench.” 

“As the first (and sometimes only) level of Pennsylvania’s 
Unified Judicial System that most citizens ever have contact 
with, efficient and accurate justice is paramount to the 
trust we instill in the entire system. Most of the people who 
come to our courts are unrepresented and seek a fair and 
accurate decision of their disputes. As local, community 
courts, we provide a delicate balance between remaining 
a neutral arbiter of facts and law and helping people to 
understand the decisions we make.”

Judge Mankamyer plans to focus on ensuring access to 
justice and addressing security concerns during her time as 
SCJAP president. 

“Every single citizen in Pennsylvania must have access to 
our courts, and must be given the appropriate time and 
attention to resolve their disputes and to feel safe.”

Mark Singer recalls always having a strong interest in 
the court system. After graduating from Penn State, Mark 
began working as an investigative aide in the Public 
Defender’s Office. 

Nearly two years into the job, he took the opportunity to 
serve the state’s attorney general as the Victim/Witness 
Coordinator, working with victims, witnesses, prosecutors 
and police. Following his time with the AG’s Office, Mark 
took his career in a new direction, working as a program 
director in the newly created criminal justice degree 
program for a local college in Maryland.

(l) MDJ Susan Mankamyer (r) Franklin County DCA Mark Singer 

In Nov. 2010, he joined the 39th Judicial District in Franklin 
County as District Court Administrator and was named 
president of PACM earlier this year.

Reflecting on the work and role of PACM, Singer said:

“PACM has been critical in my success as DCA due to 
the educational opportunities provided combined with 
networking opportunities. It has opened doors for Court 
Management opportunities, which lends itself to sharing 
successes and learning from each other as to trial and 
errors that come with being court leaders. 

“To me, inclusion is what PACM is all about. I remember my 
first conference and seeing all the new faces in the room, 
but those new faces quickly became mentors, colleagues, 
and friends. This exemplifies what PACM is about – 
collaboration and what led me to get and stay involved. 
When I became president, my theme seemed clear – 
Bridging Gaps. Fostering long-term collaboration. This is 
what PACM did for me. This is what I would like to see it do 
for all our membership. 

Being president of PACM is a privilege and an honor. I have 
been on the PACM Board since 2013 and have had the 
privilege to observe past presidents in action. I recognize 
I have big shoes to fill. Each president brings a unique 
perspective while balancing and delivering PACM's vision 
and mission to our membership while doing our "day job" 
that keeps us busy regardless of the size of one's judicial 
district.”

Lancaster County PJ appointed 
to NADCP Board of Directors 

Lancaster County President Judge 
David Ashworth was recently selected 
David Ashworth
to join the National Association for 
Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) 
Board of Directors.

The NADCP is the premier training 
and advocacy organization for the 
treatment court model – with divisions 
including the National Drug Court 
Institute, National Center for DWI 
Courts and Justice for Vets. Judge 
Ashworth was nominated and elected 
by the NADCP membership to serve a 
six-year term. 

“I’m honored to be able to work with 
so many distinguished people from all 
over the country who are dedicated 
to the treatment court concept. I look 
forward to being able to tap into all of 
the resources NADCP has to offer so I 
am better able to serve the Lancaster 
community and the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania,” he said. 

Founder and presiding judge of 
Lancaster County’s Adult Drug Court, 
PJ Ashworth also helped to create the 
county’s mental health and veterans 
treatment courts. 

“The more I learn 
about treatment 
courts, the more I am 
convinced that it is the 
most productive, cost 
effective and humane 
way to address 
people with drug 
and alcohol issues 
who are embroiled in 
the criminal justice 
system,” PJ Ashworth 
said. “Participants 
are held responsible 
for their actions while 
providing them with an 
opportunity to get their 
lives back.” 

Lancaster County President 
Judge David Ashworth 

Among his other roles, Judge 
Ashworth previously served as 
president of the Pennsylvania 
Association of Drug Court 
Professionals from 2010-2012. 

He also serves as a senior adjunct 
professor at Franklin and Marshall 
College, where he has taught a 
community-based learning course 
titled, “Problem-Solving Courts: A 
Different World” for more than 10 
years. 

Wyoming County Courthouse 
focuses on security 

In order to resolve potential 
security deficiencies at 
the Wyoming County 
Courthouse, the sheriff and 
county court administration 
decided to address the 
issue together. 

The County Commissioners 
agreed with their concerns 
and decided to financially 
support efforts to increase 
overall security measures at 
the courthouse. 

Due to COVID, the project 
has spanned 21 months thus 

far – most recently including 
a lethal threat drill that was 
conducted in September. 

In addition, the courts have 
put in place an evacuation 
drill for employees, a shot 
recognition with firearms 
in the courthouse and a 
lethal threat table-top 
exercise involving different 
community stakeholders. 

“I fully believe it is not a 
matter of if an incident 
happens at the courthouse, 
it is a matter of when,” said 

13

Wyoming/Sullivan District 
Court Administrator Jessica 
Jessica 
EllisEllis. 

“It is my top priority that 
every employee and 
constituent that comes in 

the courthouse daily, goes 
home safe each night. The 
lethal threat drill will help 
mitigate and minimize the 
consequences when a 
threat arises.”

Sign language 
interpreter video 
makes debut

Coming to court can be a daunting experience for 
anyone – and possibly even more so for people 
who are deaf and hard of hearing. 

“We have several resources available on our 
website, including a brochure entitled ‘Do you 
need a court interpreter,’ but for the first time we 
now have a video available in sign language 
Mary Vilter, Esq., 
and closed captioning,” said Mary Vilter
coordinator, Court Access for the Administrative 
Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC). 

Osvaldo Avilés, AOPC’s Interpreter Program 
Osvaldo Avilés
administrator, added “Providing language services for 
individuals who speak limited English or who are deaf or 
hard of hearing is essential to ensure that they are able to 
fully participate in judicial proceedings and court services, 
programs and activities in which their rights and interests 
are at stake.”

Produced by AOPC Communications, the video explains:
•  How to request a court interpreter
•  What to expect
•  How to communicate with court staff outside the 

courtroom 

•  Who is qualified to be a court interpreter.

Signed by Heather Schmerman and voiced by Jesse Bentley-Sassaman.

Two certified sign language interpreters from AOPC’s 
interpreter roster, Heather Schmerman and Jesse Bentley-
Sassaman signed, voiced and captioned the video in 
order to ensure maximum accessibility for deaf and 
hard of hearing court users. Bentley-Sassaman serves 
on the Monitoring & Evaluation Team, charged with 
implementing and evaluating the Language Access Plan 
for Pa. Courts. She is also a professor in the Sign Language 
department at Bloomsburg University. Schmerman is a 
certified deaf interpreter and holds a bachelor’s degree in 
Communications.

The video is posted on the Language Access and 
Interpreter Program page of the www.pacourts.us website.

Knitting for a cause

Hats, gloves and scarves donation drive for children and adults

Disciplinary Board launches online filing module

In an effort to simplify and streamline 
the manner in which documents 
and pleadings are filed with the Pa. 
Disciplinary Board, the Board has 
recently designed an online filing 
system. 

Among other documents, filings with 
the Board may include briefs, petitions 
for reinstatement, joint petitions in 
support of discipline on consent, 
motions and affidavits.

Once released to all Pennsylvania 
attorneys, the filing system will be 
housed within a larger “Attorney 
Gateway” which will be accessible 
via the “For Attorneys” tab on the 
Disciplinary Board website.

The Attorney Gateway landing page 
will allow users to update contact 
information, create new filings and 
view submitted filings. 

When creating a filing, a user will 
confirm relevant contact information 
and then select from a series of 
dropdown menus to label and 
categorize the submission. 

After a filing is submitted, it will appear 
on the user’s dashboard where the 
user will have the ability to track the 
submission through its processing. 

On the dashboard, filings will be 
designated as submitted, in review, 
accepted or rejected. While noted 

as submitted, the user will be able to 
modify the pending filing – and if a 
submission is rejected, the user will 
be contacted by the Prothonotary’s 
Office.

All submissions made by a user will 
remain listed on the dashboard until 
the Prothonotary’s Office clears the 
filing, usually after a case has been 
formally closed. 

Office of Disciplinary Counsel staff 
have been using the new system 
successfully throughout the summer 
and following the current round of 
testing, the system will be released to 
all Pa. attorneys in the near future.

Judge Murphy 
testifies about 
guardianship 

 Lois Murphy, Administrative 

On Oct. 26, Judge Lois Murphy
Judge of the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court 
of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, testified 
before the House Aging and Older Adult Services 
Committee.  

The committee was examining three bills – House 
Bills 1928, 1356 and 1890. The legislation requires 
the appointment of counsel to represent alleged 
incapacitated persons in guardianship proceedings, 
increases the reimbursement rate under the 
medical assistance program for guardians of 
older adults to $300 per month and subjects 
court-appointed guardians to criminal background 
checks, respectively.  

Judge Murphy provided the committee with a basic 
description of guardianship cases and discussed 
the opportunities for reform and improvement 
provided by the three bills based on her individual 
experience as a trial judge presiding over 
guardianship cases.

Protect yourself from  
QR code phishing 

IT Security Reminders

QR codes were almost rendered obsolete, but they have 
made a dramatic comeback thanks to the global pandemic. 
From being introduced in the 1990s to simply track product 
inventory, their versatile use has brought them a long way 
– from restaurant menus, to customer engagement with 
brands, and even faster airport check-ins. 

A QR code is a two-dimensional 
barcode, which is easily read by 
smartphones – all you need is a camera 
and an app to read the code. Perhaps 
their widest use is in the contactless-
payment ecosystem – scan the QR code 
and pay.

New forms of payment mean more scope  
New forms of payment mean more scope  
for confusion 
for confusion 

One scam tactic is the embedding of fake QR codes into a 
phishing email, text or via social media. Upon scanning the 
code, users are directed to websites with realistic-looking 
landing pages, where they may be prompted to login and 
enter personally identifiable information. 

A forged QR code also has the potential to connect to 
an unsecured Wi-Fi network or automatically navigate to 
a malicious link. Phony codes can take you to websites 
where malware can be automatically downloaded and 
used to steal sensitive information from your device, or 
even transfer spyware or viruses. 

Public QR codes (like at fuel stations or kiosks) also pose 
a risk, as cybercriminals may swap them by replacing their 
own QR codes over genuine ones. The problem is there 
is no way of reading the information contained inside the 
code before exposing the device to the unsuspecting fraud. 

How to protect yourself 
How to protect yourself 

While this type of fraud is relatively unconventional, the 
technicalities of QR codes are somewhat of a mystery to 
most users, making them potentially dangerous. Predictions 
for 2021 highlight that hackers will increasingly use these 
QR schemes and broaden them by using social-engineering 
techniques. 

It’s critical to pay close attention, even to small details 
while making payments or transactions using QR codes. 
It is best to pay using these only in secure and familiar 
environments. Remember that the risks of scanning 
an unknown QR are like clicking on links in unknown 
messages. Treat a QR code like any other link – don’t 
follow it if you don’t fully trust the source. 

Once you scan the QR code, a pop-up to view its 
embedded URL must emerge. If there is no URL, or if it 
seems like a shortened one (like bit.ly) – be cautious. It’s 
best to install a QR scanner that checks or displays the URL 
before it follows the link.

Install and update security software regularly across 
devices. If you suspect any suspicious activity, immediately 
contact your bank and have them change your login 
credentials. 

Although the QR codes themselves are a secure and 
convenient mechanism, it is widely expected for them to 
be misused by cybercriminals in the future. Knowledge of 
QR code fraud may lag significantly today, but vigilance on 
your part will ensure that you’re scanning a safe QR code 
instead of falling victim to a scam.

REMOTE HEARINGS: 
JUDGES DISCUSS THE 
GOOD AND THE BAD

Eighteen months into the coronavirus pandemic is a good 
time to reflect on the pros and cons of remote hearings 
and ask these questions: Which hearings should always 
be remote? Which should never be remote? What are 
the biggest challenges these hearings present? How is 
procedural fairness ensured, given the digital divide?

These are some of the questions that were asked and 
answered late last week at the first of five webinars 
on remote hearings presented by the Pandemic Rapid 
Response Team’s Implementation Lab. The answers came 
from New Mexico Supreme Court Justice C. Shannon Bacon 
and Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Samuel Thumma. 
Watch the full recording.

“Most judges I talk with prefer video,” Justice Bacon said. 
“They like the control it gives them over certain litigants. 
They’ve come to embrace the use of the mute button.”

With so many hybrid hearings –people making 
appearances in person and by video and phone – what do 
judges need to know?

“Patience, patience, patience,” Justice Bacon said. “The 
phone adds an interesting element. Sometimes it can be 
easy to forget that someone is appearing that way.”

Thumma pointed out that lawyers and others have 
appeared at hearings via phone for several years, but 
there’s a different dynamic now with video, in-person and 
phone.

WHICH HEARINGS SHOULD ALWAYS BE 
REMOTE? 

“Discovery disputes,” said Justice Bacon. “It’s just two 
lawyers making their best pitch to the judge, and it doesn’t 
require client participation. …I was a trial court judge for 10 
years and discovery disputes are perfect for Brady Bunch 
boxes.”

She and Judge Thumma said scheduling conferences also 
are perfect for remote hearings.

WHICH SHOULD NEVER BE REMOTE? 

Both said criminal and civil jury trials lend themselves 
to in-person hearings. Bacon added that in New Mexico, 
certain criminal proceedings, including plea and sentencing 
hearings, are always conducted in person, as are 
hearings for orders of protection, adult guardianship and 
conservatorships and termination of parental rights.

GIVEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, HOW DO JUDGES 
INCORPORATE PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS?

Judge Thumma said judges must first accept that the digital 
divide exists. Both judges said in Arizona and New Mexico, 
there are vast Native American lands without high-speed 
internet. They said computers at public libraries should be 
made available to those who would rather attend remote 
hearings but lack computers or smart phones.

NCSC Vice President of Court Consulting Services David 
Slayton said Texas, where he was state court administrator, 
identified two significant benefits to conducting remote 
jury selection proceedings: Appearance rates dramatically 
increased, as did the number of Black jurors.

“We asked potential jurors about access to technology and 
provided iPads to people without it,” he said. 

The next webinar on remote hearings will occur at 3 p.m. 
ET Thursday Oct. 21.

WHICH IS BETTER – VIDEO OR PHONE?

National Center for State Court’s newsletter – @ the Center. 

“I like being able to see people,” Judge Thumma said. 
“Visual clues help a lot.”
