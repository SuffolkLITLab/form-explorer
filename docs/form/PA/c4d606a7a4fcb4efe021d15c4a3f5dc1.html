1.  Prohibition Against Discrimination

.  Prohibition Against Harassment  

a.  Sexual Harassment  

Sexual  harassment  is  sex  discrimination.    Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission 
(EEOC)  guidelines  define  sexual  harassment  as  unwelcome  sexual  attention,  sexual 
advances,    requests  for  sexual  favors  and  other  verbal  or  physical  conduct  of  a  sexual 
nature where: 

1.  The submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly 

a term or condition of an individual’s employment; or 

2.  The submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis 

for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 

3.  Such  conduct  has  the  purpose  or  effect  of  unreasonably  interfering  with  an 
individual’s  work  performance  or  creating  an  intimidating,  hostile,  or  offensive 
working environment. 

Sexual  harassment  does  not  refer  to  socially  acceptable  behavior  or  occasional 
compliments  of  a  socially  acceptable  nature.    It  refers  to  behavior  that  a  reasonable 
person could and does consider unwelcome or personally offensive.  Sexual harassment 
involves  improper  behavior  or  requests  that  establish  improper  quid  pro  quo  workplace 
requirements of a sexual nature, or which otherwise create a hostile work environment for 
a reasonable person of that gender.  Types of sexual harassment include: 

1.  “Quid  Pro  Quo”  Harassment  –  Is  when  an  individual  in  a  position  of  authority 
demands  sexual  consideration  in  exchange  for  the  promise  of  a  job,  certain  job 
benefits such as raises or promotions, or the promise of continued employment. 

2.  “Hostile  Work  Environment”  Harassment  –  Is  when  unwelcome  sexual  advances, 
requests  for  sexual  favors  or  other  verbal  or  physical  conduct  of  a  sexual  nature 
create  an  atmosphere  which  unreasonably  interferes  with  an  individual’s  work 
performance  or  creates  an  intimidating,  hostile,  or  offensive  work  environment for 
any individual.   

Sexual  harassment  may  take  different  forms  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  following 
examples. 

1.  Verbal:  Sexually  explicit  language,  sexual  innuendoes,  suggestive  comments, 

jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions or threats. 

2.  Non-Verbal:  Display  of  sexually  suggestive  objects  or  pictures,  commentaries, 

suggestive or insulting sounds, leering, whistling, or obscene gestures. 

3.  Physical:  Unwanted  physical  contact,  or  the  threat  of  unwanted  physical  contact, 
including  offensive  touching,  un-welcomed  sexual  intercourse,  sexual  assault  and 
other forms of physical contact of a sexual nature.

b.  Racial and Other Harassment 

Under  this  Policy,  racial  and  other  harassment  is  verbal  or  physical  conduct  that 
denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of that individual’s 
race,  color,  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity  or  expression,  national  origin,  age, 
disability, or religion.  Harassing conduct may include, but is not limited to, the following: 

1.  Verbal: Epithets, slurs, stereotyping, or denigrating jokes. 

.  Non-Verbal: Display of written or graphic materials that denigrate or show hostility 
or aversion toward an individual or group in such a manner as to be readily viewed 
by others. 

.  Physical: Threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts.

rohibition Against Retaliation 

in  any 

Retaliation 
form  against  any  person  who  complains  about  harassment  or 
discrimination, who files a harassment or discrimination complaint, or who cooperates with, or 
assists  in,  the  investigation  of  such  complaints  is  prohibited  under  this  Policy.    Retaliation 
constitutes an abuse of authority, and will not be tolerated.  Retaliation by any Personnel of 
the  System,  Supreme  Court  Boards  and  Committees,  or  Related  Staff  will  be  considered 
misconduct  warranting  disciplinary  action.  All  judicial  officers,  managerial  and  supervisory 
Personnel  of  the  System,  and  Supreme  Court  Boards  and  Committees  shall  ensure 
adherence to and compliance with this Policy. 

harges  of  retaliation will  be  viewed  as  separate  and  distinct from  the  original  complaint  or 
action which precipitated the alleged retaliation and may form the basis for a new complaint.  
Retaliation  may  result  in  disciplinary  action  even  though  the  original  harassment  or 
discrimination complaint was determined to be unfounded and dismissed. 

ompliance and Reporting Responsibilities 

All Personnel of the System, Supreme Court Boards and Committees, and Related Staff are 
expected  to  comply  with  this  Policy,  and  all  judicial  officers,  managerial  and  supervisory 
Personnel of the System, and Supreme Court Boards and Committees are obligated to take 
appropriate  measures  to  ensure  that  prohibited  conduct  does  not  occur,  or  is  properly 
reported, if observed.   

ersonnel  of  the  System  and  Supreme  Court  Boards  and  Committees  who  engage  in  any 
form  of  prohibited  discrimination  or  harassment  within  a  Court  Facility  may  be  subject  to 
disciplinary action.  

elated Staff who serve the UJS and who engage in any form of prohibited discrimination or 
harassment  within  a  Court  Facility  will  be  reported  to  the  chief  official  in  their  Related  Staff

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
