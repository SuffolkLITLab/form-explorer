v. 

 

 

ONTEZ PERRIN,   

Appellant 

[J-42-2022] [MO: Mundy, J.] 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
EASTERN DISTRICT 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA,   

No. 2 EAP 2022 

CONCURRING OPINION 

USTICE DOUGHERTY  

 

 

 

 

DECIDED:  March 21, 2023 

I  agree  the  trial  court  here  was  not  required  to  accept  the  parties’  post-verdict 

stipulation to the credibility of a witness, and accordingly join the Majority Opinion.  I write 

separately to address the additional question implicated by this case, but apparently left 

open  by  the  Majority,  concerning  whether  trial  courts,  while  not  obligated  to  accept 

proposed  stipulations  to  witness  credibility,  nonetheless  retain  the  discretion  to  do  so.  

See Majority Opinion at 13 n.7 (“We do not address the question of whether the trial court, 

in its discretion, may accept a proposed stipulation as to witness credibility as that is not 

the  circumstance  currently  before  the  Court.”).    In  my  view,  Pennsylvania  law  forbids 

stipulations to the credibility of witnesses, either before or after the verdict, and because 

purported stipulations to witness credibility are invalid ab initio, trial courts may not accept 

them under any circumstances.

“A stipulation is a declaration that the fact agreed upon is proven.”  Commonwealth 

v.  Rizzuto,  777  A.2d  1069,  1088  (Pa.  2001).    “A  stipulation  of  facts  is  binding  and 

conclusive  on  a  trial  court,  although  the  court  may  nonetheless  draw  its  own  legal 

conclusions  from those  facts.”    Mader  v.  Duquesne Light  Co.,  241  A.3d 600,  615  (Pa. 

2020).  There is no doubt “stipulations are highly favored in our judicial system[.]”  Chao 

v. Hotel Oasis, Inc., 493 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2007).  Among other benefits, stipulations 

can streamline the factual issues before the court, eliminate the need for tedious proof, 

expedite  litigation,  reduce  costs  to  the  court  system,  and  minimize  expenses  to  the 

parties.    See  83  C.J.S.  Stipulations  §2  (2022).    Nonetheless,  the  ability  of  parties  to 

stipulate is not boundless.  “[P]arties cannot stipulate to matters affecting the jurisdiction, 

business, or convenience of the courts.”  Northbrook Life Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 949 

A.2d 333, 337 (Pa. 2008), citing Parsonese v. Midland Nat. Ins. Co., 706 A.2d 814, 815 

(Pa. 1998), and Foote v. Maryland Cas. Co., 186 A.2d 255, 258 (Pa. 1962); accord Mader, 

241 A.3d at 615 (“Under Pennsylvania law, litigants may limit the issues to be considered 

by the court except for matters affecting the jurisdiction, business, or convenience of the 

court.”) 

 

As an initial matter, witness credibility is not a fact subject to stipulation.  A “fact” 

is “[s]omething that actually exists; an aspect of reality[.]”  Fact, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 

(11th ed. 2019).  “Credibility,” on the other hand, is “[t]he quality that makes something 

(as a witness or some evidence) worthy of belief.”  Credibility, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 

(11th ed. 2019); see also 81 AM. JUR. 2D Witnesses §917 (2023) (“Witness credibility is a 

subjective,  amorphous  quality,  often  defined  as  much  by  the  preconceptions  of  the 

persons who perceive the witness as by the witness’s personal characteristics.”).  It is 

 
[J-42-2022] [MO: Mundy, J.] - 2 

axiomatic  that  a  witness  can  appear  worthy  of  belief,  and  thus  be  deemed  credible, 

without this actually being the case.  Simply because a witness may give the impression 

of  being  truthful  does  not,  of  course,  make  it  so.    When  parties  purport  to  stipulate  to 

witness credibility they are not agreeing to an objective fact, but rather a highly subjective 

and vague quality that may or may not reflect reality.  Indeed, the agreement to credibility 

may say just as much (if not more) about the preconceptions and biases of those doing 

the agreeing than it does the actual credibility of the witness.  The indefinite characteristic 

of credibility is not a fact amenable to stipulation. 

 

Moreover, a stipulation to witness credibility impermissibly invades the business of 

the  trial  court.    It  is  well-settled  in  this  Commonwealth  that  assessing  the  credibility  of 

witnesses  is  within  the  exclusive  province  of  the trial  court,  either  acting on  its  own or 

through a jury.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Alston, 373 A.2d 741, 743 (Pa. 1977) (“The 

resolution of issues of credibility is within the province of the trial court.”); Commonwealth 

v.  Garvin,  293  A.2d  33,  39  (Pa.  1972)  (“The  law  is  well  settled  that  it  is  the  exclusive 

province of the trier of facts to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be 

accorded their testimony.”).  If the parties simply stipulate to the credibility of a witness, 

however, this freezes out the trial court entirely, and usurps the court’s sole prerogative 

to  decide  questions  of  credibility.    Importantly,  the  “bedrock  principle  that  questions  of 

credibility are exclusively for the fact-finder[,]” Armbruster v. Horowitz, 813 A.2d 698, 703 

(Pa. 2002), is not merely “a limitation on appellate courts” deciding credibility on a cold 

record.  Commonwealth’s Reply Brief to Brief of Amicus Curiae the Office of the Attorney 

General  at  3  n.1.    This  Court  has  never  so  held,  nor  is  there  any  support  for  such  a 

construction.  On the contrary, in the stipulation context, as on appeal, there is no firsthand 

 
[J-42-2022] [MO: Mundy, J.] - 3 

evaluation of the witness’s in-court testimony under oath and subject to the crucible of 

questioning,  which  is  indispensable  to  an  informed  evaluation  of  credibility.    See 

Commonwealth v. King, 990 A.2d 1172, 1180 (Pa. Super. 2010) (holding judge “could not 

possibly  have  made  fully  informed  credibility  determinations  without  observing  the 

demeanor of the witnesses”).  A party stipulation to credibility, like appellate credibility-

finding,  lacks  the  procedural  safeguards  essential  to  a  proper  assessment  of  the 

credibility of a witness.   

 

Finally, barring credibility stipulations will not “unduly burden” the criminal justice 

system.    Commonwealth’s  Brief  at  27.    Explicit  stipulations  to  witness  credibility,  in 

contrast to stipulations only inferentially implicating credibility which are beyond the scope 

of this case, are hardly “routine” in this Commonwealth.  Appellant’s Opening Brief at 16.  

Quite  the  opposite,  express  credibility  stipulations  appear  to  be  rare  to  the  point  of 

nonexistent.    Indeed, the  parties  fail  to  cite even  a  single Pennsylvania  case  involving 

such  a  stipulation.    Their  reliance  on  Commonwealth  v.  Williams,  215  A.3d  1019  (Pa. 

Super. 2019), is misplaced.  In Williams, the parties stipulated “[t]he Commonwealth does 

not  stand  behind  the  credibility  of  [Philadelphia  Police]  Officer  [Reginald]  Graham’s 

testimony  at  Williams’[s]  trial.”    Williams,  215  A.3d  at  1025.    Thus,  the  stipulation  in 

Williams  was  not  to  the  witness’s  credibility, but  the  Commonwealth’s  confidence  in  it.  

Moreover, a  formal  investigation  independent  of  the parties concluded  Officer  Graham 

engaged  in  criminal  conduct  and  lacked  credibility.    See  Williams,  215  A.3d  at  1028 

(“Following  Williams’  2007  arrest,  an  investigation  by  the  Philadelphia  Police  Board  of 

Inquiry determined that Graham engaged in criminal conduct as a police officer. . . . [T]he 

Board of Inquiry found that Graham committed theft, prior to Williams’ trial, and then lied 

 
[J-42-2022] [MO: Mundy, J.] - 4 

about it during the internal affairs investigation.”) (citation to record omitted).   Further, the 

Williams stipulation concerned testimony at a previous trial, not upcoming testimony at a 

future proceeding.  As the Majority correctly notes, there was no stipulation in Williams, 

as there is here, that a witness would testify credibly (or incredibly for that matter) at a 

forthcoming hearing or trial.  See Majority Opinion at 9 (“Unlike the proposed stipulations 

at  issue  herein,  the  stipulations  in  Williams  did  not  assert  a  potential  witness  at  an 

evidentiary hearing would testify credibly.”); id. (“[T]here was no proposed stipulation to 

witness credibility in Williams[.]”).  In any event, to the extent Williams may be read to 

endorse credibility stipulations, it runs headlong into, and is superseded by, this Court’s 

precedents  providing  that  only  facts  are  amenable  to  stipulation  and  credibility 

assessments are the exclusive prerogative of the trial court.  Furthermore, while amicus, 

perhaps in an abundance of caution, vaguely indicates stipulations to credibility may be 

permissible  “in  limited  and  appropriate  circumstances,”  it  does  not  specify  what  such 

circumstances  might  entail  or  cite  any  authority  endorsing  this  procedure.    Brief  for 

Amicus Curiae the Office of Attorney General at 19.   

For the foregoing reasons, I believe stipulations to witness credibility are not, and 

should  not  be,  permitted  in  this  Commonwealth.    Hence,  while  I  fully  agree  with  the 

Majority the trial court in this case did not err in refusing to accept the parties’ proposed 

credibility stipulation, in my view no court in any context has the discretion to do otherwise. 

Justice Wecht joins this concurring opinion.
