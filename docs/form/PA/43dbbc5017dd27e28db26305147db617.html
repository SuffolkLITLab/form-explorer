Monica  Staniec  (Staniec)  appeals  from  the  order  of  the  Court  of  Common 

Pleas  of  Philadelphia  County  (the  trial  court)  denying  her  motion  for  class 

certification.  On appeal, Staniec argues the trial court erred in determining she failed 

to establish a prima facie case for the commonality, typicality, and predominance 

requirements for class certification.  Upon review, we vacate the trial court’s order 

and remand for further consideration of the motion for class certification.  

I. 

Background 

The City of Philadelphia (the City) organizes and operates the Broad Street 

Run (the Race), which is an annual running race in the City.  Reproduced Record 

(R.R.)  at  3a,  15a.    The  Race  was  scheduled  to  take  place  on  May  3,  2020.    Id.  

Potential racers entered an online lottery,1 and, if they were selected, paid a $57.00 

entry fee to register for the Race.  Id.  Approximately 43,500 people (the Racers) 

registered for the Race.   Trial Ct. Op., 10/22/21, at 1.  On March 23, 2020, after 

accepting the Racers’ registration fees, the City delayed the Race and rescheduled it 

to October 4, 2020, due to the recent onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  R.R. at 3a, 

15a.   

 

On July 14, 2020, the City announced its decision to transition the Race to a 

virtual event,2 which it admitted was “a result of the public health dangers involved 

in holding a race of 40,000 runners during the COVID[-]19 pandemic.”  R.R. at 3a, 

15a.  The City also informed the Racers they would each receive their official race 

t-shirt, a finisher’s medal, and guaranteed entry into the 2021 Broad Street Run with 

a 20% registration fee discount.  Id. at 6a, 16a.  Regarding refunds, the City posted 

a statement on the Race’s website indicating “[u]nfortunately, we can’t offer runners 

a refund. . . . We appreciate your understanding of the position we are in and our 

need  to  follow  our  ‘no  refund’  policy  that  was  included  in  your  registration 

materials.”  Id. at 6a-7a, 17a. 

On August 12, 2020, Staniec filed a class action lawsuit against the City in 

the trial court.  See R.R. at 1a-13a.  In her lawsuit, Staniec brought a cause of action 

for  breach  of  contract,  alleging  the  City  unilaterally  changed,  and  breached,  the 

terms of the contract between the City and the Racers.  Id. at 9a-10a.  Staniec also 

brought a second, alternative cause of action for unjust enrichment, alleging the City 

 

1   The  City  gave  approximately  5,000  people  a  guaranteed  registration  opportunity  as  part  of 
signing up for a separate running event.  R.R. at 5a, 16a.  The City also gave a small number of 
people a guaranteed registration opportunity as tenured or deferred runners.  Id.  
    
2   Virtual  races,  which  became  common  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  are  running  events 
where runners must run a specific race distance during a specific date range, at a location of their 
choosing.  R.R. at 6a.   

2 

was unjustly enriched by retaining the Racers’ registration fees and not providing an 

in-person race.  Id. at 10a-11a. 

On September 22, 2021, after Staniec filed a motion for class certification and 

the parties submitted briefs, the trial court held a class certification hearing.  See R.R. 

at  415a-40a.    At  the  hearing,  Staniec’s  counsel  presented  argument,  through  a 

PowerPoint presentation, as to why class certification was appropriate in this matter.  

See R.R. at 417a-33a, 441a-74a.  Staniec’s counsel did not admit any documents or 

other evidence into the record.  See R.R. at 415a-40a.  Thereafter, the City argued 

Staniec failed to carry her burden of proof with regard to each element necessary for 

class certification, except for numerosity (which the City conceded), because Staniec 

only  presented  conclusory  statements  and  allegations  through  argument,  not 

evidence, at the class certification hearing.  Id. at 433a-34a.  Thus, the City rested 

and did not present evidence in opposition to Staniec’s proposed class certification.  

Id. at 433a-37a. 

On October 25, 2021, the trial court entered an order denying Staniec’s motion 

for class certification and transferring Staniec’s individual claims to the trial court’s 

compulsory arbitration program.  See Trial Ct. Order, 10/25/21.  In its opinion, the 

trial court determined Staniec failed to present evidence to “satisfy the commonality, 

typicality, and predominance requirements for certifying a class.”3  See Trial Ct. Op., 

10/25/21, at 11.   

 

3   The trial court initially opined that “the [a]dequacy of [r]epresentation [r]equirement [was] [n]ot 
[f]ully  [s]atisfied”  because  “there  [was]  no  evidence  that  representative  plaintiff’s  interests  in 
maintaining this class action are not in conflict with those of class members who waived their right 
to  a  refund  or  otherwise  wish  to  let  the  City  retain  their  registration  fee.”    See  Trial  Ct.  Op., 
10/25/21, at 9.  Despite this statement, the trial court did not include adequacy of representation in 
its list  of reasons  for denying  class certification.   See id.  at  11.   Additionally, in  its  opinion in 
support of order, filed pursuant  to  Pennsylvania  Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a), the trial 
(Footnote continued on next page…) 

3 

With respect to commonality, the trial court concluded “[t]here are questions 

of law and fact common to each class member’s claims, questions of law and fact 

that may require the creation of several sub-classes, and other questions of law and 

fact that may require individualized inquiries.”  Id. at 2.  The trial court noted the 

City admitted many of the material facts and opined that the remaining issues are 

“issues of law that cannot be resolved without taking into consideration the City’s 

defenses . . . .”  Id. at 5.  The trial court then conceded the City’s two main defenses 

to Staniec’s breach of contract claim (waiver and impossibility) are common to all 

class members.  Id. at 5-6.  If those common defenses fail, however, the trial court 

opined it would have to “consider the City’s additional, much more individualized, 

affirmative defenses to the breach of contract claim . . . .”  Id. at 6.   

Those  “affirmative  defenses”  included  (a)  whether  “some  or  all  class 

members receive[d] sufficient value in exchange for their registration fee[,]” such 

as: (1) “the [r]unners’ [p]ackage[,]” (2) participation in “the 2020 virtual race[,]” (3) 

the “right to run in 2021 at a discounted rate[,]” and (4) the right to “transfer their 

[registration] for free to other persons[,]” (b) whether “some class members ‘value 

the  civic  and  charitable  nature  of  the  race  [and/or]  simply understand  the  unique 

public health circumstances that forced the change in the race and seek no further 

remedy[,]’”  and  (c)  whether  “some  class  members  .  .  .  fail[ed]  to  mitigate  their 

damages by not asking for a refund[.]”  Trial Ct. Op., 10/25/21, at 7.   

Finally, the trial court noted that if Staniec’s “contract claim fails, the class 

[would be] left with only the unjust enrichment claim . . . .”  Id.  According to the 

 

court expressly stated that “this court did not base its decision to deny certification on any failure 
of plaintiff to satisfy the adequacy requirement . . . but rather this court based its decision not to 
certify  the  class  on  plaintiff’s  failure  to  make  out  a  prima  facie  case  with  respect  to  the 
commonality, typicality, and predominance requirements.”  See Trial Ct. Op., 12/10/21, at 4.   

4 

trial court, Staniec’s unjust enrichment claim “‘demands an individualized inquiry, 

because it requires a showing that the plaintiff [conferred benefits] in good faith, that 

the defendant  [appreciated those benefits], and that the plaintiff had a reasonable 

expectation of compensation.’”  Id. at 7-8 (citation and emphasis omitted).  The trial 

court concluded “these issues necessarily involve individual inquiries not suited to 

resolution through the class action mechanism.”  Id. at 8.     

With respect to typicality, the trial court concluded Staniec’s “claims may not 

be typical with respect to the questions concerning every potential sub-class, and her 

claims may not be typical with respect to the individual defenses.”  Trial Ct. Op., 

10/25/21, at 3.  The trial court noted the “named plaintiff’s position appears to have 

diverged from that of other class members,” because she did not ask for or receive a 

refund, run in the virtual race, or transfer her registration to someone else.  Id. at 8-

9.  In addition, the trial court noted Staniec may not ascribe the same value as other 

class members to receiving the runners’ package, automatic entry and discounted 

registration for the 2021 Broad Street Run, or the City’s charitable endeavors.  Id. at 

9.  As a result, the trial court concluded “there is no testimony or other evidence that 

[Staniec’s] claims are typical of the entirety of the putative class.”  Id.   

With respect to predominance, the trial court, noting the issues outlined above, 

opined that the common questions of law or fact did not predominate over questions 

affecting only individual members, because “there is no evidence that the common 

unanswered questions of law and fact raised by plaintiff predominate over the many 

individualized questions raised by the City’s myriad pled defenses, which apply to 

each of the putative class members differently.”  Id. at 10. 

5 

Staniec timely appealed to this Court4 from the trial court’s October 25, 2021 

order.5  In her appeal, Staniec asserts the trial court committed several errors of law 

in  determining  she  did  not  establish  a  prima  facie  case  for  the  commonality  and 

predominance requirements for class certification.  In addition, Staniec asserts the 

trial  court  applied  the  incorrect  legal  standard  and  relied  upon  speculation  in 

determining she did not establish the typicality requirement.    

II.  Analysis 

In reviewing a trial court’s decision on class certification, we are mindful that: 

[c]lass certification presents a mixed question of law and fact.  The trial 
court is vested with broad discretion in deciding whether an action may 
be pursued on a class-wide basis and, where the court has considered 
the  procedural  requirements  for  class  certification,  an  order  granting 
class  certification  will  not  be  disturbed  on  appeal  unless  the  court 
abused its discretion in applying them. . . . In deciding whether class 
action procedural requirements were misapplied or ‘an incorrect legal 

 

4   Staniec asserts this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 762(a)(4).  Despite the title 
(“local government civil and criminal matters”), 42 Pa.C.S. § 762(a)(4) does not confer jurisdiction 
on the Commonwealth Court every time a local government is a named party in a civil lawsuit.  In 
this particular case, none of the specific provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. § 762(a)(4) confer jurisdiction 
on this Court, as this is a breach of contract and/or unjust enrichment claim that is unrelated to any 
statutes regulating local governmental entities.  Nevertheless, since the City did not  object, our 
jurisdiction was perfected pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 704(a). 
   
5   The trial court’s October 25, 2021 order is appealable as a collateral order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 
313, as this Court has held that orders denying class certification are collateral orders.  See, e.g., 
Doe 1 v. Franklin Cnty., 272 A.3d 1022, 1031 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2022); Dunn v. Allegheny Cnty. Prop. 
Assessment Appeals & Rev., 794 A.2d 416 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002).  Our sister court, the Pennsylvania 
Superior  Court,  has  likewise  consistently  held  that  “an  order  refusing  to  certify  a  class  is  an 
appealable collateral  order.”   See Cardinale v. R.E. Gas Dev., LLC, 154 A.3d 1275,  1285 (Pa. 
Super. 2017) (quoting Kern v. Lehigh Valley Hosp., Inc., 108 A.3d 1281, 1283 n.2 (Pa. Super. 
2015)).    “In  general,  Superior  Court  decisions  are  not  binding  on  this  Court,  but  they  offer 
persuasive precedent where they address analogous issues.”  Lerch v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. 
of Rev., 180 A.3d 545, 550 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018) (citation omitted).

standard [was] used in ruling on class certification,’ we review issues 
of law subject to plenary and de novo scrutiny. 

Samuel-Bassett v. Kia Motors Am., Inc., 34 A.3d 1, 15 (Pa. 2011) (internal citations 

omitted).  When our scope of review is plenary, we may review the entire record.  

When our standard of review is de novo, we may fully reconsider the issues.  See 

Passel  v.  Dep’t  of  Transp.,  Bureau  of  Driver  Licensing,  928  A.2d  381,  383  (Pa. 

Cmwlth. 2007).      

A  class  action  is  a  “procedural  device  designed  to  promote  efficiency  and 

fairness in the handling of large numbers of similar claims, while providing a forum 

for small claimants to seek compensation for claims that would otherwise be too 

small to litigate.”  Dunn v. Allegheny Cnty. Prop. Assessment Appeals & Rev., 794 

A.2d 416, 423 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002).  Accordingly, “decisions in favor of maintaining 

a class action should be liberally made.”  Id. (citing Janicik v. Prudential Ins. Co. of 

Am., 451 A.2d 451 (Pa. Super. 1982)).  A case may proceed as a class action if: 

(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; 
(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; 
(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the 

claims or defenses of the class; 

(4) the  representative  parties  will  fairly  and  adequately  assert  and 
protect  the  interests  of  the  class  under  the  criteria  set  forth  in 
[Pennsylvania] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 1709; and 

(5) a class action provides a fair and efficient method for adjudication 
of the controversy under the criteria set forth in [Pennsylvania] Rule 
[of Civil Procedure] 1708. 

Pa.R.Civ.P. 1702. 

Once the pleadings close and a plaintiff files a motion for certification of a 

class  action,  trial  courts  must  hold  a  class  certification  hearing.    See  Pa.R.Civ.P. 

1707.  At the class certification hearing, the burden of proof is upon the party seeking 

certification.  Janicik, 451 A.2d at 454.  The party seeking certification “need only 

7 

present evidence sufficient to make out a prima facie case ‘from which the court can 

conclude  that  the  five  class  certification  requirements  are  met.’”    Baldassari  v. 

Suburban Cable TV Co., 808 A.2d 184, 189 (Pa. Super. 2002) (quoting Janicik, 451 

A.2d at 455).  Prima facie evidence is “[e]vidence that will establish a fact or sustain 

a judgment unless contradictory evidence is produced.”  BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 

(11th  ed.  2019).    While  this  “burden  is not  heavy,  more  than  mere  conjecture  or 

conclusory allegations are required.”  Doe 1 v. Franklin Cnty., 272 A.3d 1022, 1033 

(Pa. Cmwlth. 2022).  A trial court must “consider all relevant testimony, depositions, 

admissions and other evidence.” Pa.R.Civ.P. 1707.6  Trial courts also “regularly and 

properly employ reasonable inferences, presumptions, and judicial notice.” Janicik, 

451 A.2d at 454-55 (citations omitted).      

“Because the requirements for class certification are closely interrelated and 

overlapping,  the  class  proponent  need  not  prove  separate  facts  supporting  each; 

rather, her burden is to sufficiently establish those underlying facts from which the 

court  can  make  the  necessary  conclusions  and  discretionary  determinations.”  

Janicik,  451  A.2d  at  455  (citations  omitted).    Additionally,  “[w]ell-pleaded  class 

action allegations, if admitted by the class opponent, may be considered as evidence 

at  the  class  certification  hearing.”    Id.  (citations  omitted).    If  the  party  seeking 

certification carries its burden, the burden then shifts to the class opponent to present 

contrary  evidence  that  class  certification  is  improper.    Id.  at  455-56.    Absent  a 

contrary showing, the class action is presumed valid.  Id. at 457.        
 

 

 

6    “At the certification hearing, the court will have before it the class action allegations in the 
complaint, the defendant’s answer to these allegations, any depositions or admissions relating to 
these allegations and any testimony relating to those allegations that may be offered at the hearing.” 
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1707, 1977 Explanatory Comment. 

8 

A. Commonality and Predominance 

We begin our analysis by considering Staniec’s  position that the trial court 

committed 

legal  errors 

in  analyzing 

the  commonality  and  predominance 

requirements for class certification.  To maintain a class action, the class proponent 

must establish there are “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  Pa.R.Civ.P. 

1702(2).  This is referred to as the commonality requirement.  In analyzing whether 

a class meets the commonality requirement, “[t]he critical inquiry for the certifying 

court is whether the material facts and issues of law are substantially the same for 

all class members.”  Samuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 22. 

The  predominance  requirement,  as  it  is  commonly  referred  to,  examines 

“whether common questions of law or fact predominate over any questions affecting 

only  individual  [class]  members.”    See  Pa.R.Civ.P.  1702(5),  1708(a)(1).    “The 

standard  for  showing  predominance  is  more  demanding  than  that  for  showing 

commonality, . . . but is not so strict as to vitiate Pennsylvania’s policy favoring 

certification of class actions.”   Samuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 23 (citations omitted).  

“The ‘predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive 

to warrant adjudication by representation.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  “Thus, a class 

consisting of members for whom most essential elements of its cause or causes of 

action may be proven through simultaneous class-wide evidence is better suited for 

class  treatment  than  one  consisting  of  individuals  for  whom  resolution  of  such 

elements  does  not  advance  the  interests  of  the  entire  class.”    Id.  (citations  and 

emphasis omitted).  

Staniec’s  first  argument  is  that  the  trial  court  committed  legal  error  in 

concluding she failed to establish the commonality and predominance requirements 

for  class  certification  by  improperly  considering  the  City’s  unsupported  claims.  

9 

Staniec chose to only present argument at the class certification hearing, and she did 

not admit any evidence or provide the testimony of any witnesses.  See R.R. at 415a-

40a.  The City, believing Staniec did not present any evidence to sustain her burden 

of proof, chose to also not present any evidence or testimony at the class certification 

hearing.    See  R.R.  at  433a-37a.    The  trial  court,  however,  had  an  obligation  to 

consider  all  “[w]ell-pleaded  class  action  allegations,  if  admitted  by  the  class 

opponent, . . . as evidence at the class certification hearing.”  Janicik, 451 A.2d at 

455.  Since the City admitted to facts in its Answer to Staniec’s Complaint, Staniec 

did not need to introduce additional evidence at the hearing to sustain her burden.  

Instead, the burden shifted to the City.     

Unlike the City, Staniec only admitted one material allegation from the City’s 

Answer  and  New  Matter,  which  was  that  she  did  not  request  a  refund  of  her 

registration fee.  See R.R. at 20a, 24a-26a.  Because Staniec did not admit the City’s 

additional allegations and the City chose to not present any evidence to support those 

allegations,  the  trial  court  was  not  permitted  to  consider  them.    See  Pa.R.Civ.P. 

1707(c) (“[T]he court shall consider all relevant testimony, depositions, admissions, 

and other evidence.”).  The trial court did, however, consider the City’s unsupported 

allegations.7  As Staniec asserted, this was an error of law. 

Staniec’s  second  argument  is  the  trial  court  failed  to  properly  consider  the 

facts admitted by the City in its commonality and predominance analysis.  The trial 

court identified many of the facts the City admitted in its opinion.  See Trial Ct. Op., 

 

7   As  one  example  of  the  trial  court’s  error,  the  trial  court  noted  that  the  City  asserted  in  its 
memorandum of law in opposition to class certification that some class members “value the civic 
and charitable nature of the race [and/or] simply understand the unique public health circumstances 
that forced the change in the race and seek no further remedy[.]”  See Trial Ct. Op., 10/25/21, at 
7.  The trial court improperly considered these assertions, which had no evidentiary backing and 
were  not  the  subject  of  any  of  Staniec’s  admissions,  and  analyzed  them  as  “individualized[] 
affirmative defenses.”  See id. at 6-7. 

10 

10/25/21, at 5.  However, the trial court then only considered the remaining contested 

matters when determining whether the case presented common questions of law or 

fact.  Id. at 5-8, 10 (“[T]here is no evidence that the common, unanswered questions 

of law and fact raised by plaintiff . . .”) (emphasis added).  The “critical inquiry,” as 

set forth in Samuel-Bassett, is not whether the unanswered material facts and issues 

of  law  are  substantially  the  same  for  all  of  the  class  members,  but  whether  “the 

material facts and issues of law are substantially the same for all class members.”  

Samuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 22.  This includes  material facts and/or issues of law 

which  have  been  admitted  by  the  parties.    See  Janicik,  451  A.2d  at  455  (“Well-

pleaded  class  action  allegations,  if  admitted  by  the  class  opponent,  may  be 

considered as evidence at the class certification hearing.”).  Accordingly, we agree 

with Staniec that the trial court committed legal error by failing to consider the City’s 

admissions in its commonality and predominance analysis.   

Staniec also argues the trial court improperly considered the City’s position 

that  the  proposed  class  members  could  have  requested  a  refund.    The  trial  court 

considered the proposed class members’ failure to request a refund, thereby failing 

to  mitigate  damages,  as  a  potential  “individualized[]  affirmative  defense”  to  the 

breach of contract claim.  See Trial Ct. Op., 10/25/21, at 6-7.  Unlike the City’s other 

potential  defenses,  the  City  had  an  evidentiary  showing  to  support  this  potential 

defense,  because  Staniec  admitted  in  her  Reply  to  New  Matter  that  she  did  not 

request  a  refund  of  her  registration  fee.8    See  R.R.  at  20a,  24a.    At  the  class 

certification stage, “the merits of the action and the right of the plaintiff to recover 

are  to  be  excluded  from  consideration.”    See  Pa.R.Civ.P.  1707,  Explanatory 

8   Staniec did not request a refund because the City posted on the Race’s website that it “can’t 
offer runners a refund” and “need[ed] to follow [its] ‘no refund’ policy.”  R.R. at 6a-7a.     

 

11 

Comment.    Accordingly,  the  trial  court  properly  disregarded  the  merits  of  this 

defense and considered it, not as a proven defense, but as a potential defense.   

The trial court did err, however, in considering the potential class members’ 

failure  to  request  refunds  as  an  individualized  defense.    Staniec’s  proposed  class 

included all registrants for the Race who did not receive a refund.  The City admitted 

that it refunded the registration fees for each Racer who requested a refund.  See R.R. 

at 15a.  As a result, the City’s defense relating to the class members not requesting 

a refund will be common to the entire class.     

Staniec  also  posits  that  the  trial  court  erred  when  it  considered  the  City’s 

efforts  to  mitigate  damages  as  negating  the  fact  damages  exist  and  creating 

individualized defenses to the breach of contract claim.  Specifically, Staniec argues 

the  trial  court  erred  in  questioning  the  “subjective  ‘value’  the  modified  contract 

provided,” because “[t]he City’s arguments, and the trial court’s naked acceptance 

of them, all related to post-breach conduct and the improper contract modification.”  

Appellant’s Br. at 23-26.  Thus, Staniec argues “[w]hether the virtual race had any 

value is immaterial; or at most goes generally to the concept of mitigation.”  Id. at 

26.    Staniec  further  argues  the  City’s  “purported  individualized  defenses”  “at 

best . . . go to the amount of damage each Proposed Class member suffered, not the 

fact of damage.”  Id. at 27 (emphasis in original).  We agree. 

An  affirmative  defense  is  defined  as  “a  defendant’s  assertion  of  facts  and 

arguments that, if true, will defeat the plaintiff’s . . . claim, even if all the allegations 

in the complaint are true.”  BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019).  To prove 

her primary breach of contract claim, Staniec would have to establish three basic 

elements: (1) the existence of a contract, including its essential terms, (2) a breach 

12 

of a duty imposed by the contract, and (3) resultant damages.  Gen. State Auth. v. 

Coleman Cable & Wire Co., 365 A.2d 1347, 1349 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1976).   

As fully outlined above, and as found by the trial court, the City admitted the 

material facts that were necessary for Staniec to establish a prima facie case for her 

breach of contract claim.   See Trial Ct. Op., 10/25/21, at 4-5.    The  City’s claims 

regarding its conduct after the alleged breach of contract (providing the Racers with 

a race shirt, runner’s package, virtual race, guaranteed and discounted entry to the 

next year’s race, and the ability transfer their registration for free) do not defeat any 

of the three basic elements of Staniec’s breach of contract claim.  Instead, they relate 

to mitigation and the amount of damages, not whether damages exist.  “[I]t is well 

established that questions as to the amount of individual damages will not preclude 

a class action.”  Baldassari, 808 A.2d at 194-95.  Accordingly, the trial court erred 

in utilizing the City’s mitigation efforts as a basis to deny class action certification.   

With the trial court’s specific errors in mind, we review its conclusion Staniec 

failed  to  establish  the  commonality  and  typicality  requirements  for  class 

certification.  The “critical inquiry”  for commonality is whether “the material facts 

and issues of law are substantially the same for all class members.”  Samuel-Bassett, 

34 A.3d at 22.  This includes all admitted material facts.  See Janicik, 451 A.2d at 

455 (“Well-pleaded class action allegations, if admitted by the class opponent, may 

be considered as evidence at the class certification hearing.”).  Predominance favors 

“a class consisting of members for whom  most  essential elements of its cause or 

causes  of  action  may  be  proven  through  simultaneous  class-wide  evidence.”  

Samuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 23.  Each element of Staniec’s breach of contract claim 

and each defense to that claim are common to the City and all the proposed class 

13 

members.  In addition, the first two elements9 of Staniec’s unjust enrichment claim 

are also common to the parties.      

While it is true there are some more individualized inquiries with respect to 

the  third  element  of  Staniec’s  unjust  enrichment  claim  (whether  the  City’s 

acceptance  and  retention  of  the  Racer’s  registration  fees  was  under  inequitable 

circumstances),  “the  existence  of  distinguishing  individual  facts  is  not  ‘fatal’  to 

certification.”    Samuel-Bassett,  34  A.3d  at  23  (citation  omitted).    Instead,  “the 

common  questions  of  fact  and  law  merely  must  predominate  over  individual 

questions.”  Id.  When we consider Staniec’s primary contractual claim and much of 

her alternative unjust enrichment claim are comprised of common questions of fact 

and  law,  the  common  issues  readily  predominate  over  the  far  less  significant 

questions affecting only individual members.10  Accordingly, we conclude the trial 

court applied incorrect legal standards and erred in determining that Staniec failed 

to establish a prima facie case for the commonality and predominance requirements 

of class certification.   

B. Typicality 

We next consider Staniec’s argument the trial court applied an incorrect legal 

standard and improperly speculated in determining she did not establish “the claims 

or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the 

class.”  See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1702(3).  This is commonly known and referred to as the 

 

9   A claim for unjust enrichment requires proof of “(1) benefits conferred on the defendant by the 
plaintiff; (2) appreciation of the benefits by the defendant; and (3) the defendant’s acceptance and 
retention of the benefits under circumstances that it would be inequitable to do so.”  Wilson Area 
Sch. Dist. v. Skepton, 860 A.2d 625, 631 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004) (citation omitted).  
   
10  Should the trial court grant class certification and determine that this is no longer true at any 
point in the litigation, “[t]he court may alter, modify, or revoke the [class] certification.”  Janicik, 
451 A.2d at 455 (citing Pa.R.Civ.P. 1710, 1711). 

14 

typicality  requirement. 

  “Its  purpose 

is  to  determine  whether  the  class 

representative’s overall position on the common issues is sufficiently aligned with 

that of the absent class members to ensure that her pursuit of her own interests will 

advance those of the proposed class members.”  Janicik, 451 A.2d at 457 (citation 

omitted).  “Typicality exists if the class representative’s claims arise out of the same 

course of conduct and involve the same legal theories as those of other members of 

the putative class.”  Samuel-Bassett, 34 A.3d at 31 (citing Dunn, 794 A.2d at 425).     

The trial court only considered the differing amount of damages that various 

class  members  could  recover  in  determining  that  Staniec  had  not  established 

typicality.  See Trial Ct. Op., 10/25/21, at 8-9.  “It is well established that questions 

as to the amount of individual damages will not preclude a class action.”  Baldassari, 

808 A.2d at 194-95; Cook v. Highland Water & Sewer Auth., 530 A.2d 499, 505 (Pa. 

Cmwlth.  1987)  (“Where  a  common  source  of  liability  can  be  clearly  identified, 

varying amounts of damage among the plaintiffs will not preclude class certification.  

However, where there exists [ ] various intervening and possibly superseding causes 

of the damage, liability cannot be determined on a class-wide basis.”).  Accordingly, 

the trial court erred in determining Staniec did not establish a prima facie case for 

the typicality requirement.   

In  analyzing  the  correct  legal  standard,  we  note  that  the  City  admitted  it 

entered into a contract with the Racers for an in-person race, received the Racers’ 

registration  fees,  cancelled  the  in-person  race,  and  did  not  refund  the  Racers’ 

registration fees.11  Staniec is seeking compensation for the Racers, in the form of a 

refund  of  their  registration  fees,  on  theories  of  breach  of  contract  and  unjust 

enrichment.  Staniec’s claims arose from the same course of conduct and involve the 

11  Except for those individuals who ignored the City’s directive that it would not provide refunds 
and, nevertheless, requested a refund. 

 

15 

same legal theories as the rest of the putative class’s claims.  In addition, Staniec’s 

pursuit of her own interests, where she seeks a refund of her own registration fee, 

will advance the proposed class members’ interests.  Thus, we conclude Staniec has 

established  a  prima  facie  case  for  the  typicality  requirement  and  the  trial  court’s 

contrary conclusion was based upon the application of an improper legal standard.  

C. Fair and Efficient Method for Adjudication 

Although  we  have  determined  the  trial  court  erred  in  determining  Staniec 

failed  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  for  the  commonality,  predominance,  and 

typicality  requirements  for  class  certification,  we  cannot  simply  reverse  the  trial 

court.    The  predominance  requirement  is  only  one  of  several  factors  outlined  in 

Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1708 for determining the fifth requirement for 

class certification, which is that “a class action [must] provide[] a fair and efficient 

method  for  adjudication  of  the  controversy  under  the  criteria  set  forth  in 

[Pennsylvania]  Rule  [of Civil Procedure] 1708.”    Pa.R.Civ.P. 1702(5).    After the 

trial court determined Staniec had not established the predominance requirement, it 

stopped analyzing the other factors set forth in Rule 1708.  “It is not for this Court, 

in the first instance, to make findings on these factors.”  Doe 1, 272 A.3d at 1036.  

Accordingly, we must vacate the trial court’s order and remand this matter to the 

trial court to make  findings of fact and conclusions of law  as to  whether Staniec 

established  that  a  class  action  would  provide  a  fair  and  efficient  method  for 

adjudication of the controversy under the criteria set forth in Pa.R.Civ.P. 1708.    

III.  Conclusion 

For the reasons set forth above, we conclude the trial court applied incorrect 

legal standards in determining that Staniec failed to establish a prima facie case for 

16 

the commonality, typicality, and predominance requirements12 for class certification.  

In analyzing the correct legal standards, we conclude Staniec has established a prima 

facie case for each of these requirements.  The trial court did not, however, analyze 

the remaining factors set forth in Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1708.  As a 

result, we vacate the trial court’s order and remand this matter to the trial court for 

further findings and conclusions consistent with this opinion.
