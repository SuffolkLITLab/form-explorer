RoboLaw

Artificial intelligence is rapidly disrupting every industry in America 
and every sector of society – and the courts are not exempt.

RoboLaw:
Coming soon to 
your courtroom

By Gary E. Marchant 
Regents Professor and Faculty Director, Center for Law, Science & Innovation, 
Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, Arizona State University

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly 
disrupting every industry in America 
and every sector of society – and the 
legal system and the courts are not 
exempt. Indeed, there are already 
a number of court functions and 
elements of legal practice that are 
being transformed by AI, with much 
more to come over the next decade. 

Even though AI has been around since 
the late 1950s, its recent emergence 
and prevalence is the result of some 

2

important leaps forward in how AI 
operates. Until recently, AI was rule-
based, in that machines implemented 
instructions coded by a human 
programmer. 

Today, most AI is data-based, in 
which the machine is not instructed 
what to do by any human, but rather 
learns itself how to solve problems or 
accomplish tasks by processing data 
and experience. This new approach 
known as machine learning is radically 

expanding the utility and capabilities 
of AI.

Machine-learning AI already permeates 
our daily lives. Examples of this 
include internet search engines, voice 
capabilities on our smart phones and 
home speakers, Google Maps, ride-
sharing apps like Uber and Lyft, online 
shopping and music sites that predict 
our preferences, etc. 

But machine-learning AI also has 
application to the courts. 

Recently, U.S. Supreme Court Chief 
Justice John Roberts was asked 
“Can you foresee a day when smart 
machines, driven with artificial 
intelligences, will assist with courtroom 
fact-finding or, more controversially 
even, judicial decision-making?” 

The Chief Justice replied: “It’s a day 
that’s here and it’s putting a significant 
strain on how the judiciary goes about 
doing things.”

There are three primary domains in 
which AI interacts with the judiciary 
and court system: AI in legal 
practice and court operations, AI as 
evidence and legal claims against AI 
applications.

AI in Legal Practice and Court 
Operations

problem that the United States and 
other jurisdictions face. 

Although still in its early days AI is 
already being implemented in legal 
practice and judicial operations. 

Technology-assisted review (TAR) for 
electronic discovery was one of the 
first legal applications, and is now 
quite advanced and common. Courts 
are often asked to weigh in on the 
appropriateness and conduct of TAR in 
specific cases.

Other AI-enabled tools are also being 
used for legal research, either from 
stand-alone vendors, or established 
legal research databases like Westlaw 
and Lexis. 

An even more fundamental change 
is the use of AI to help make judicial 
decisions, not just advocate for and 
inform such decisions. A handful of 
judges have started using AI systems 
such as IBM’s Watson to sift through 
the large records in many cases and 
recommend decisions on specific 
issues or even the entire case. 

The cohort of judges using AI on the 
bench is expected to grow rapidly. 

AI as Evidence

The second major category of AI 
application for the courts is the use 

by governments for various functions. 
AI algorithms will increasingly 
be used as evidence in toxic tort 
causation inquiries, antitrust analyses, 
discrimination cases and many other 
types of cases.

Legal Claims Against AI 
Applications

The last category of AI interactions 
applicable to the courts is when 
legal claims are made against AI 
applications. These can be safety 
claims in tort or product liability, which 
we are already starting to see with 
autonomous vehicles and AI medical 
devices. There may also be legal 
claims of bias or discrimination against 
AI applications. 

Recently U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was asked “Can you  
foresee a day when smart machines, driven with artificial intelligences, will assist 
with courtroom fact-finding or, more controversially even, judicial decision-making?” 
The Chief Justice replied: “It’s a day that’s here and it’s putting a significant strain 
on how the judiciary goes about doing things.”

These AI research programs were 
initially used by private law firms, but 
now are being marketed to and used 
by judicial staff as well. 

Perhaps most provocatively, several 
vendors now market AI brief-writing 
systems that are targeted to specific 
judges, which integrate data on 
previous decisions, favorable and 
unfavorable arguments, and other 
available data about specific judges, to 
customize and target a brief to make it 
most appealing to an individual judge.

Online dispute resolution (ODR) 
systems are a subject of active 
investigation by both private 
companies and courts in the United 
States and elsewhere. These systems 
will employ AI to provide quick and 
inexpensive preliminary decisions, 
especially in simpler cases, without any 
initial involvement by human lawyers or 
judges. Such ODR systems could help 
address the major access to justice 

of AI algorithms as evidence. The 
first major use has been algorithms 
to assist judges in sentencing, 
recidivism risk assessment and pre-trial 
detentions. 

The use of such AI algorithms raise 
issues about whether they should 
be used, how and when they should 
be used, and who gets access to the 
underlying algorithm code and data, 
which often are proprietary. 

The Wisconsin Supreme Court recently 
decided such issues in its Loomis 
v
 Wisconsin decision holding that 
.
algorithms can be used in sentencing 
but cannot be the exclusive factor, 
and that criminal defendants are not 
entitled under due process to obtain 
access to the underlying algorithm and 
data. 

Other state courts have held that it 
may be a due process violation not to 
disclose the underlying algorithm used 

Other AI uses may raise privacy 
legal claims. Intellectual property will 
become a big issue for the courts 
– for example, how does copyright 
and patent law apply to inventions or 
creations in which AI was all or part of 
the design function? 

In all of these types of cases, as 
in the other domains of AI and the 
courts described above, judges and 
court staff will soon start seeing 
more and more applications of AI 
in the process and substance of 
their work, and will need to become 
sophisticated consumers of this soon-
to-be ubiquitous technology in order 
to promote and protect the justice 
function of our court systems.

the Pennsylvania State Trial Judges 
Conference where he spoke about how 
AI is being used in the legal industry.)

Staying secure - cybersecurity defenses

With access to sensitive data on 
individuals and organizations, 
government entities are 
increasingly becoming a desirable 
target for cybercriminals. 

While the AOPC has many lines 
of technological defense in 
place to protect us from possible 
cyberattacks, unfortunately there 
is no way to guarantee complete 
prevention of a successful breach. 

“These cyberattacks can come 
in many forms, but the most 
challenging to defend against 
originate through phishing emails, 
and our end users serve as one of 
the most important security layers,” 
said Betty Torrey, AOPC/IT user 
security specialist.

Phishing attacks use social 
engineering to try to gain 

confidential information, including 
usernames, passwords and network 
credentials, or to trick the user into 
installing a malicious computer 
program. By posing as a known 
and trusted source, cybercriminals 
attempt to manipulate the user into 
entering personal information into 
a phony website or installing a fake 
version of a legitimate application. 

All court personnel should be 
highly suspicious of all links and 
attachments included in emails, 
even if the sender is well known. 
If there is any doubt as to their 
authenticity, it is best to have the 
email checked before opening 
anything.

Employees should contact AOPC/
IT Security (ITSecurity@pacourts.us) 
with any cybersecurity questions, or 
to have an email checked.

Cybersecurity tips:

1.  Use passphrases to 
increase password length  

and strength while still 

making them memorable

2.  Remove any unnecessary 
software on your computer 

3.  Avoid entering personal 
information when using  

public Wi-Fi 

New video 
provides civics 
refresher on 
the courts 

Facilitating access to justice is the highest priority of 
Pennsylvania’s courts. But if people don't understand 
government, they might not appreciate the role the courts 
play in protecting their rights and freedoms. If people are 
unaware of the role of the courts, they may see no harm in 
political attacks on judges and attempts to weaken or strip 
courts of their powers. 

The AOPC recently released a new “Learn about the Courts” 
education video that describes in basic terms the role of the 
courts in a democracy, how the Pennsylvania court system is 
structured and how various types of cases advance through 
the system.

Developed and produced by AOPC/Communications, the 
video debuted at a Judicial Independence Commission 

event entitled “Inside the Pennsylvania Courts: A live-stream 
Panel Discussion” in September.  

The 3-minute video is a modern concept aimed at a broad 
audience, including high-school students. The new video 
replaces a longer-form video used for the past 15 years. 
Hopefully the video will catch attention both on social media 
as well as in classrooms and courthouses. 

With more than 200,000 people summoned to jury 
duty each year in Pennsylvania, the video can serve as 
an educational resource. Members of the judiciary are 
encouraged to use the video when making presentations 
at schools, community meetings or giving speeches to 
fraternal organizations or other groups.

Pennsylvania’s 
court technology 
receives national 
recognition

A reaffirmation of Pennsylvania’s leadership status in court 
technology, the National Association for Court Management 
(NACM) and Court Information Technology Officers 
Consortium (CITOC) selected Pennsylvania as a two-time 
winner of their 2019 Technology Awards. 

Two AOPC/IT projects garnered the national recognition – 
the recently implemented Guardianship Tracking System 
(GTS) and the PDF/A electronic document archival solution. 

“For more than 30 years, Pennsylvania has been a 
technology leader among other state court systems. While 
this is not the first time our talented staff has been honored 
by peers nationally, it is the first time two such honors have 
occurred in the same year,” said Court Administrator of 
Pennsylvania, Tom Darr. 

Coming on the heels of implementation of Pennsylvania’s 
landmark Clean Slate program, which depends on 
Pennsylvania’s Judicial Computer System for data, this 
is a year of significant technological achievement for 
Pennsylvania’s Judiciary.”

Guardianship Tracking System

The GTS won the Court Process Innovations Award in the 
Court Management category for its “optimization of the 
way people, processes and technology work together to 
transform courts.” 

GTS provides a tool for court offices to better manage 
guardianship cases, and it allows for the e-filing of required 
annual reports and inventories by guardians.

The system includes functionalities such as electronic 
notifications to guardians for upcoming and overdue reports, 
compliance tracking, the insertion of flags for potential areas 
of loss and neglect, statewide alerts placed on guardians 
and the delivery of detailed statistics for reporting and policy 
making.

PDF/A electronic document archival solution

Simultaneously, the AOPC’s PDF/A electronic document 
archival solution received the Emerging Technologies Award 
in the Court Technology category. 

This project developed a way for courts to permanently store 
court documents electronically, and was recognized for its

President Paul DeLosh from VA.

Enterprise IT Applications Architect Judy Tosten

utilization of cutting-edge technologies that solve the 
increasing retention problems county courts are facing in 
attempts to store all their paper records.

This new innovative format ensures the long-term 
preservation, as well as the accurate display of all electronic 
documents – even in the distant future after computer 
standards and formats have evolved. 

The Pennsylvania courts were recognized at both the 2019 
NACM Annual Conference on July 25 in Las Vegas, Nevada, 
and at the 2019 Annual CITOC meeting in New Orleans, 
Louisiana, on Sept. 9.

Security:  
past, present 
and future

By Rob Granzow
judicial district security administrator  

Kyle Ramberger
assistant director of judicial district security 

Security is both a personal and a collective responsibility. 
While AOPC/Judicial District Security strives to provide the 
technical expertise and resources necessary to drive an 
environment of safety and security in the Pennsylvania court 
system, they also heavily rely on the vigilant participation of 
all those working and having business in the courts. 

In response to several security incidents which occurred in 
the magisterial district courts, a Magisterial District Court 
Security Task Force was formed in 2018.

This Task Force, chaired by Magisterial District Judge John 
Fishel, has a diverse complement of stakeholders and 
is charged with the responsibility of providing front-line 
observations and recommendations for potential procedural 
and technological security enhancements within the 
magisterial district courts. 

Further championing the importance of judicial district 
security, Justin Mammen, Emergency Services and Security 
Manager for the Superior Court of California, Orange 
County, delivered a compelling presentation to attendees at 
the June 2019 PJ/PACM Conference in State College. 

Mammen’s presentation focused on current trends in court 
security including the expanded use of cameras, panic/
duress alarms systems, weapon-screening and mass 
notification systems. 

He reinforced the fact that while technological 
enhancements are generally beneficial, they remain 
dependent upon the human element to maximize their 
effectiveness, as no technology unto itself will stop an 
incident from occurring.

Local court security committees

The importance and value of Pennsylvania’s local court 
security committees, comprised of president judges, 
county executives, sheriffs, district court administrators and 
magisterial district judges, convening regularly to review 
security matters in their districts cannot be underestimated.

Local court security committees are also responsible for 
developing policies and procedures that are clear, concise, 
cohesive and comprehensive.

6

These policies and procedures bring optimal value when 
they are applied consistently throughout the various 
magisterial and common pleas courts and modified as 
necessary when a vulnerability in a local policy or procedure 
is identified.  

Utilizing PAJIRS

All of Pennsylvania’s courts have the capacity to accurately 
document security incidents and events through the 
Pennsylvania Judicial Incident Reporting System (PAJIRS).  

It is important to remember that a security incident in 
Pennsylvania is defined as “an event that has the potential 
to cause, or has in fact caused personal injury or property 
loss.”  

Reporting a security threat or incident via PAJIRS is vital for 
the safety of judges, court employees and the public who 
utilize the court system. It not only allows for the accurate 
documentation of the incident, but for a timely review by 
AOPC/Judicial District Security staff where security guidance 
and direction is routinely provided.  

Effective training

While there is not a single piece of equipment, nor policy 
or procedure that can prevent all emergent situations from 
ever occurring, effective training of personnel can and will 
enhance the safety and security of our courts.

While judicial districy security staff welcomes suggestions 
for future training and education programs, topics currently 
under development include, Situational Awareness 
and Violence Avoidance, Emergency Preparedness for 
Courthouse Emergencies, Hostile Intruder and Active 
Shooter Response for Judicial Environments and Managing 
Aggressive Persons (MAP).   

With 2020 on the horizon, AOPC/Judicial District Security is 
well-energized to continue its mission of providing technical 
expertise and resources necessary to drive an environment 
of safety and security within the Pennsylvania Court system. 
However, for this vision to be fully realized, it will require 
everyone’s active participation.

L to R:  Commonwealth Court’s Gretchen Hanrahan, chief legal counsel and Michael Krimmel, prothonotary 

Leadership changes to 
Commonwealth Court

Commonwealth Court 
recently announced a series 
of leadership changes that 
took effect on July 22. 

most recently as a staff 
attorney in the Office of the 
Prothonotary – which is now 
the Office of Legal Counsel. 

The Court’s newly-appointed 
Chief Legal Counsel 
Gretchen Hanrahan, Esq., 
has assumed the duties of 
former Prothonotary Kristen 
Brown, Esq. following her 
recent retirement after 37 
years with the Court. 

Hanrahan has worked 
for the Court for 23 years 
in various capacities, 

“I am grateful to the 
President Judge and the 
Board of Judges for their 
confidence,” said Hanrahan.

I have been with the Court 
for most of my professional 
career, and I look forward to 
working with the judges and 
our talented court staff in 
this new role.” 

Meanwhile, Commonwealth 
Court’s former Chief 
Clerk, Michael Krimmel, 
Esq. has assumed the 
title of prothonotary, and 
is now responsible for 
managing the Office of the 
Prothonotary—formerly 
known as the Office of the 
Chief Clerk. 

Krimmel served as staff 
counsel to the Minor Court 
Rules Committee before 
being appointed chief clerk 
of the Commonwealth 

Court in 2006. Prior to that, 
he worked in county court 
administration for 14 years. 

“This is a change in titles, 
not a change in functions,” 
explained President Judge 
Mary Hannah Leavitt.  

These new titles will better 
reflect the functions, duties, 
and responsibilities of each 
position and each office 
within the Court.”

Supreme Court Chief Law Clerk John Witherow recently published a military 
fiction novel – “THE GAP: Fort Indiantown.”

The story follows a young helicopter pilot, Mark Ashford, through the 
many challenges he faces at the Army National Guard flight facility at Fort 
Indiantown, Pennsylvania. Upon his arrival for his first duty assignment, 
Mark suffers a cold welcome, finding little empathy from the older and more 
experienced pilots under his command.

On a drug interdiction assignment, Mark befriends a boy who is being 
manipulated by drug dealers. As he tries to help the boy, Mark must also 
confront a subordinate’s secret traumatic past and make irreversible 
decisions putting his lifelong dream of flying at risk.

“The Gap is a coming-of-age story that poses questions about the wisdom 
of the current drug war while employing themes from another lost war,” said 
Witherow.

He wrote this novel as a tribute to the veteran pilots at Fort Indiantown Gap. 
His first-hand experience as a former helicopter pilot in the Pennsylvania 
National Guard, coupled with his sensitivity to the challenges facing the 
American criminal justice system, offers an incredibly unique perspective.

All are welcome to join him in celebrating the book’s launch at his book-
signing on Thurs., Oct. 24 at 7 p.m. at the Midtown Scholar Bookstore in 
Harrisburg.

Raising butterflies and 
awareness is an AOPC 
employee’s passion

“My love and fascination for butterflies started before I can 
even remember,” AOPC/IT’s Marisol Barrios explained. 

When she was five years old, Marisol loved butterflies so 
much that her parents opened a clothing store and named it 
“The Butterfly Boutique.” Her love for the creatures has only 
continued to grow.

When asked how she got into raising butterflies, Marisol said 
that it started with just one butterfly she found nearly 20 
years ago. 

 “I knew from doing some research in the early 2000’s that 
monarchs love a plant called milkweed – but I wasn’t sure 
what milkweed looked like. A co-worker of mine who was a 
master gardener took me to a patch of milkweed behind our 
office building where I actually found my first caterpillar.”

Marisol explained that she now continues to raise Monarchs 
because of their endangered status.  

“It’s actually quite easy to raise them,” Marisol said. “I’ll 
collect the eggs and raise 20 to 30 at a time in my kitchen 
with rubber bands, coffee filters and plastic cups.”

Marisol researches and visits locations near her in 
Pennsylvania that are dense with milkweed, the Monarchs’ 
host plant, where she finds and collects eggs.

“Monarchs actually have a very unique life cycle,” Marisol 
said. “They stay in Mexico all winter and then start flying 
north to Canada around March, so their migration season in 
Pennsylvania doesn’t begin until late June or July.”

She can raise around 100 butterflies every season with a 90 
percent success rate. In comparison, only about 10 percent 
of Monarchs in the wild survive on their own. 

“The biggest threats to Monarchs are pesticides in the U.S. 
and illegal logging in Mexico, and I want people to be aware 
of the devastating effects that our systemic agricultural 
practices are having – they are putting all of our insects at 
risk,” she said. 

I was initially drawn to them because of their beauty, but 
it’s become more about helping them once I found out how 
much trouble they’re in.” 

“You don’t have to raise them like I do, but there are a lot of 
little things that people can do to help Monarchs – use fewer 
pesticides, buy more organic, tag Monarchs and report 
sightings on the Journey North app to help with research,” 
Marisol elaborated. 

The good news is that Monarchs are set to make a 
comeback this year thanks to the efforts of dedicated 
people like Marisol who use their passion to make a 
difference!

Berks County implements new 
notification system 

This summer, Berks County became 
the second county in the state to 
implement a new electronic notification 
system that sends automatic text and/
or email messages to defendants 
reminding them about upcoming 
criminal court dates.

The alerts are sent out three days 
before preliminary hearings at 
magisterial district courts, and two 
days prior to all Common Pleas Court 
appearances.  

Participation in this program is 
mandatory and defendants are 
required to provide their mobile phone 
number and email on an intake form 
located on the county’s website. 

“We hope this program increases 
efficiency, decreases warrants for 
defendants who may have simply 
forgotten, and decreases costs for both 
defendants and for the county,” said 
President Judge Thomas G. Parisi. 

The program is administered by the 
County Commissioners Association of 

Pennsylvania (CCAP) and launched on 
July 1. 

The county will evaluate its results after

How the PA relay service works

Tips for successful 
relay calls:

•  Don’t hang up.

•  Say “Go Ahead” or “GA” each 

time you have finished speaking. 

•  Speak directly to the person 

calling, not to the CA. 

•  Ask questions one at a time. 

•  Be patient and speak slowly. 

•  Know that the CA will type 

everything he or she hears.

You're manning the front desk. 
A call comes in. You answer, but 
there's a long delay between 
what you say and any response 
from the caller. You hear 
something about a relay service. 
What's happening?

Chances are you're taking a 
call from a person using the 
Pennsylvania Relay Service – a 
service that makes telephone 
conversations possible for those 
who are deaf or hard of hearing. 

to a particular phone number 
and person using a special 
device called a TTY. 

When you answer a relay 
call, the CA will say “Hello, a 
person is calling you through 
Pennsylvania Relay. This is 
CA number XXXX. Have you 
received a relay call before?” 
If you are not familiar with 
relay, say “NO” and the CA will 
explain how it works in more 
detail.  

Here’s how it works – the deaf 
or hard of hearing person dials 
711 and asks a Communications 
Assistant (CA) to connect them

Legislative roundup by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

The House and Senate are recessed for the summer and return on Sept. 17 and 23, 
respectively. Prior to recess, a flurry of legislative activity took place. 

2019-20 General Appropriations Act:
This year’s general fund budget level-funded the judiciary’s 
government operations at $355.789 million. An increase of 
$286,000 was included for the Judicial Conduct Board.

Changes to the composition of the Commission on 
Sentencing: 
Pursuant to changes made in the Administrative Code 
and becoming effective Oct. 1, the chief justice will now 
appoint two judges of courts of record and a law professor 
knowledgeable in criminal sentencing. 

The president judges of the Superior and Commonwealth 
Courts will now each appoint one judge of a court of record. 
The amendment removes all executive appointments and 
eliminates the victim advocate as an ex officio nonvoting 
member. 

Finally, the amendment increases the number of legislative 
appointments to the Commission. 

Victim/witness legislation:  
Marsy’s Law – a victim rights constitutional amendment 
– passed for the required second time, and a question 
seeking voter approval will appear on the November 
ballot. The amendment passed in tandem with statutory 
amendments to protect victims/witnesses, and became 
effective on Aug. 27:
•  Act 23 – adds a new right in the Crime Victims Act 

prohibiting the exclusion of victims from any criminal 
proceedings, absent court finding that the victim’s 
testimony would be materially altered if he/she heard 
other testimony at the proceeding;  

•  Act 24 – amends the Rape Shield Law to exclude 
in certain circumstances evidence of past sexual 
victimization or allegations thereof;

•  Act 30 – grants protections similar to those afforded to 
children under the tender years exception to individuals 
with intellectual disabilities and autism. 

School police officers:
Previously under the Public School Code, school entities 
could apply to Courts of Common Pleas for the appointment 
of school police officers. Upon appointment, judges could 
grant the school police officers the power to arrest, issue 
citations for summary offenses and/or detain students until 
the arrival of local law enforcement.  

Act 67 removes school police officer arrest power.  
Additionally, the act requires judges, at the request of a 
school entity, to grant school police officers the authority to 
carry firearms if the officer:
• 

has successfully completed basic training as required 
by the Municipal Police Officers’ Education and 
Training Commission, OR is a graduate of the PA State 
Police Academy, was employed as a trooper and has 
separated from service in good standing, AND 
has successfully completed the Basic School Resource 
Officer Course of Instruction or an equivalent course of 
instruction approved by the Pennsylvania Comission on 
Crime and Delinquency.

• 

Act 67 became effective Aug. 27, and contains numerous 
other amendments pertaining to school resource officers 
and security guards – the changes discussed above are 
only those involving Courts of Common Pleas. 

Coming up: 
The House and Senate are scheduled for 24 and 15 
voting days, respectively, this fall. Among other issues, it is 
expected the legislature will: 
1.  Continue to debate reforms to statutory probation 

provisions, building upon a two-day Senate hearing 
held in June in which a panel of Common Pleas judges 

participated; and
2.  Continue debate on a second justice 

reinvestment initiative.

Commonwealth Court 
hosts mock trial 

By Amy Kehner
AOPC/Judicial Programs administrator 

On May 23, with two weeks of middle school remaining 
before summer break, a group of 135 soon-to-be high 
school freshmen from Cumberland Valley’s Good Hope 
Middle School visited the Pennsylvania Judicial Center. 

As the final project in their U.S. History class, students 
conducted a mock trial to decide how much responsibility 
Germany should be assessed for World War I.

Commonwealth Court Judge Ellen Ceisler and state Rep. 
Greg Rothman, 87th Legislative District, Cumberland County, 
welcomed students to the James S. Bowman En Banc 
Courtroom. 

Judge Ceisler reminded students how the three different 
branches of government function and summarized the 
significance of an independent judiciary. She impressed 
upon the class the importance of the American jury system 
and the civic duty to serve as a juror.

While Judge Ceisler presided over the courtroom, the 
students were solely responsible for assuming all roles 
involved - including judges, jurors, prosecuting lawyers, 
defense counsel, witnesses, bailiffs and sketch artists. The 
proceedings were even recorded by the Court’s own court 
reporter.

Judge Ceisler asked questions to engage the students and 
explained why certain court procedures are critical to the 
fair and impartial administration of justice.

Now in its fifth year, this program offers students a hands-
on experience that helps enhance their listening skills, 
gain confidence in public speaking, and practice the art of 
advocacy, all while learning about possible careers.
