 No. 1009 MDA 2022 

Appeal From the Judgment of Sentence Entered June 10, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-31-CR-0000598-2020 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., OLSON, J., and DUBOW, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY OLSON, J.: 

FILED:  MARCH 17, 2023 

Appellant,  Dante  C.  Carter,  appeals  from  the  judgment  of  sentence 

entered  on  June  10,  2022,  as  made  final  by  the  denial  of  Appellant’s 

post-sentence  motion  on  June  21,  2022.    On  this  direct  appeal,  Appellant’s 

counsel  has  filed  both  a  petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  as  counsel  and  an 

accompanying brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) 

and Commonwealth v. Santiago, 978 A.2d 349 (Pa. 2009).  We conclude 

that  Appellant’s  counsel  has  complied  with  the  procedural  requirements 

necessary to withdraw.  Moreover, after independently reviewing the record, 

we conclude that the instant appeal is wholly frivolous.  We, therefore, grant 

counsel’s  petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  and  affirm  Appellant’s  judgment  of

NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

As the trial court explained: 

sentence. 

 

  

J-S02028-23 

[Appellant] is an inmate serving a life sentence in the custody 
of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.  On June 10, 
2022, he was convicted, via pleas of nolo contendere, of one 
count  each  of  assault  by  prisoner,  strangulation,  and 
aggravated assault.[1]  The charges arose out of an incident 
that  occurred  at  SCI-Huntingdon  on  August  13,  2018,  in 
which  [Appellant]  twice  engaged  in  physical  combat  with 
corrections officers.  [Appellant] was sentenced on the same 
day  that  he  entered  his  pleas,  resulting  in  a  sentence  of 
84-168  months'  incarceration  on  the  first  count,  12-24 
months'  incarceration  on  the  second  count,  and  15-30 
months'  incarceration  on  the  third  count,  to  be  served 
concurrently [with Appellant’s life sentence]. 

Trial Court Opinion, 8/30/22, at 1 (footnote and some capitalization omitted). 

The  trial  court  denied  Appellant’s  post-sentence  motion  on  June  21, 

2022  and  Appellant  filed  a  timely  notice  of  appeal.    On  appeal,  Appellant’s 

counsel  filed  a  petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  and  counsel  accompanied  this 

petition with an Anders brief. 

Before  reviewing  the  merits  of  this  appeal,  this  Court  must  first 

determine  whether  counsel  has 

fulfilled 

the  necessary  procedural 

requirements  for  withdrawing  as  counsel.    Commonwealth  v.  Miller,  715 

A.2d 1203, 1207 (Pa. Super. 1998). 

To  withdraw  under  Anders,  counsel  must  satisfy  certain  technical 

requirements.  First, counsel must “petition the court for leave to withdraw 

stating that, after making a conscientious examination of the record, counsel 

has determined that the appeal would be frivolous.”  Miller, 715 A.2d at 1207.  

Second, counsel must file an Anders brief, in which counsel: 

____________________________________________ 

1 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2704, 2718(a)(1), and 2702(a)(3), respectively. 
 

- 2 - 

1) provide[s] a summary of the procedural history and facts, 
with  citations  to  the  record;  (2)  refer[s]  to  anything  in  the 
record  that  counsel  believes  arguably  supports  the  appeal; 
(3)  set[s]  forth  counsel’s  conclusion  that  the  appeal  is 
frivolous;  and  (4)  state[s]  counsel’s  reasons  for  concluding 
that  the  appeal  is  frivolous.    Counsel  should  articulate  the 
relevant facts of record, controlling case law, and/or statutes 
on  point  that  have  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  appeal  is 
frivolous. 

Santiago, 978 A.2d at 361. 

Finally, counsel must furnish a copy of the  Anders brief to his or her 

client  and  advise  the  client  “of  [the  client’s]  right  to  retain  new  counsel, 

proceed pro se or raise any additional points worthy of this Court’s attention.”  

Commonwealth v. Woods, 939 A.2d 896, 898 (Pa. Super. 2007).   

If  counsel  meets  all  of  the  above  obligations,  “it  then  becomes  the 

responsibility  of  the  reviewing  court  to  make  a  full  examination  of  the 

proceedings and make an independent judgment to decide whether the appeal 

is  in  fact  wholly  frivolous.”    Santiago,  978  A.2d  at  355  n.5;  see  also 

Commonwealth  v.  Yorgey,  188  A.3d  1190,  1197  (Pa.  Super.  2018)  (en 

banc) (holding that the Anders procedure requires this Court to review “the 

entire  record  with  consideration  first  of  the  issues  raised  by  counsel.    .  .  .  

[T]his  review  does  not  require  this  Court  to  act  as  counsel  or  otherwise 

advocate on behalf of a party.  Rather, it requires us only to conduct a review 

of the record to ascertain if[,] on its face, there are non-frivolous issues that 

counsel, intentionally or not, missed or misstated.  We need not analyze those 

issues of arguable merit; just identify them, deny the motion to withdraw, and 

  (

J-S02028-23 

- 3 - 

order  counsel  to  analyze  them”).    It  is  only  when  all  of  the  procedural  and 

substantive  requirements  are  satisfied  that  counsel  will  be  permitted  to 

In  the  case  at  bar,  counsel  complied  with  all  of  the  above  procedural 

obligations.  We must, therefore, review the entire record and analyze whether 

this appeal is, in fact, wholly frivolous.  Our analysis begins with the claims 

raised in the Anders brief: 

1.] Whether the trial court erred in dismissing [Appellant’s] 
post-sentence motion in the form of a preliminary objection 
of  [Appellant]  to  [the  Commonwealth’s]  complaint  and 
criminal procedure? 

2.] Whether the trial court erred in dismissing [Appellant’s] 
post-sentence motion in the form of a petition for warrant in 
lieu of habeas corpus without a hearing? 

3.]  Whether  claims  of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel 
should be presented in a collateral proceeding? 

  [

  [

  [

Appellant’s Brief at 3 (some capitalization omitted). 

Appellant’s first two claims are grounded in his belief that he, personally, 

enjoys sovereign immunity from all criminal prosecution and that the court of 

common pleas thus lacked jurisdiction over Appellant’s person.  This claim is 

frivolous, as Appellant is not a sovereign. 

Finally, Appellant claims that his trial counsel was ineffective.  This claim 

is unreviewable on direct appeal.  Commonwealth v. Grant, 813 A.2d 726, 

738 (Pa. 2002) (“as a general rule, a [defendant] should wait to raise claims 

of 

ineffective  assistance  of 

trial  counsel  until  collateral  review”); 

J-S02028-23 

withdraw. 

- 4 - 

J-S02028-23 

Commonwealth v. Holmes, 79 A.3d 562, 620 (Pa. 2013) (“absent [certain, 

specified] circumstances [(that are inapplicable to the case at bar)] claims of 

ineffective assistance of counsel are to be deferred to PCRA review; trial courts 

should not entertain claims of ineffectiveness upon post-verdict motions; and 

such  claims  should  not  be  reviewed  upon  direct  appeal”).  Appellant's 

ineffective assistance of counsel claim is thus frivolous. 

We have independently considered the issues raised within Appellant’s 

brief and we have determined that the claims are frivolous.  In addition, after 

an  independent  review  of  the  entire  record,  we  see  nothing  that  might 

arguably  support  this  appeal.    The  appeal  is  therefore  wholly  frivolous.  

Accordingly, we affirm Appellant’s judgment of sentence and grant counsel’s 

petition for leave to withdraw. 

Petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  appearance  granted.    Judgment  of 

sentence affirmed.  Jurisdiction relinquished.
