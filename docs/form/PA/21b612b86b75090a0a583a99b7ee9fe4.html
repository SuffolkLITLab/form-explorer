NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

IN RE: I.M.R., AN ALLEGED 
INCAPACITATED PERSON 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

PPEAL OF: WILLIAM CARDWELL 

Appeal from the Decree Entered April 8, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon County Orphans’ Court at 
No(s):  2021-281 

 No. 728 MDA 2022 

EFORE:   BOWES, J., McCAFFERY, J., and STEVENS, P.J.E.* 

MEMORANDUM  BY  BOWES,  J.:                              FILED:  MARCH  16,  2023

 

William  Cardwell  appeals  from  the  April  8,  2022  decree  adjudicating 

I.M.R.  to  be  a  totally  incapacitated  person  and  appointing  Huntingdon-

Bedford-Fulton Area Agency on Aging (the Agency”) as the permanent plenary 

guardian of the person and estate of I.M.R.  We remand for the preparation 

of  a  supplemental  orphans’  court  opinion  explaining  the  reasons  for  its 

adjudication or specifying where in the record such reasons may be found.  

 

I.M.R.  was  born  in  November  1938.    In  2014,  I.M.R.  displayed 

symptoms  of  cognitive  decline  and  memory  loss  that  would  eventually  be 

diagnosed  as  vascular  dementia,  a  progressive  condition  which  impairs  her 

ability to function independently.  Immediately prior to September 2021, she

resided with her adult son, Appellant, who exercised power of attorney on her 

behalf.  The agency became involved with the family on September 13, 2021, 

after a stranger discovered I.M.R. wandering alone, unable to state her name, 

and indicating that she did not want to live with her son.  N.T., 12/20/21, at 

24.    Appellant  refused  to  cooperate  fully  with  the  Agency’s  subsequent 

investigation of the incident.  Id. at 25-27.  

On December 6, 2021, the Agency sought and received the appointment 

of  an  emergency  plenary  guardian  of  both  the  person  and  estate  of  I.M.R.  

Thereafter, on December 15, 2021, the Agency filed a petition to adjudicate 

incapacity and to appoint a permanent plenary guardian for the person and 

estate  of  I.M.R.    The  petition  alleged  that  I.M.R.  needed  daily  care  and 

supervision  to  ensure  her  safety,  and  it  averred  that  no  alternative  to  the 

appointment of a guardian had been considered.   

 

Following four non-consecutive evidentiary hearings, the orphans’ court 

entered  the  above-described  decree  adjudging  I.M.R.  to  be  totally 

incapacitated and appointing the Agency as the permanent plenary guardian 

of  both  the  person  and  estate  of  I.M.R.    Appellant  timely  filed  a  notice  of 

appeal, and the orphans’ court filed a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) order directing him 

to  file  and  serve  a  Rule  1925(b)  statement  within  twenty-one  days  of  the 

order.    Appellant  failed  to  file  the  statement  within  the  allotted  period.  

Instead, he filed the statement five days late.  Then, without leave of court, 

he filed an amended statement two weeks later.  Finding all the issues to be

presented. 

waived, the orphans’ court declined to address the merits of any of the issues 

 

Appellant’s  brief  reiterates  six  of  the  issues  that  he  included  in  his 

untimely Rule 1925(b) statement: 

1. Did the orphans’ court abuse its discretion or make an error of 
law when it granted the Huntingdon- Bedford- Fulton Area Agency 
on Aging’s motion for access to records without giving [I.M.R.] or 
William Cardwell an opportunity to respond? 

. Did the [orphans’] court abuse its discretion or make an error 
of law when it granted emergency guardianship without a hearing 
when there was no adequate proof of an actual emergency? 

. Did the [orphans’] court abuse its discretion or make an error 
of law when it prohibited Shaun O’Toole, Esq., [I.M.R.’s] previous 
attorney, from representing [her] . . . in this matter? 

. Did the [orphans’] court abuse its discretion or make an error 
of  law  when  it  failed  to  appoint  William  Cardwell  as  guardian  of 
[I.M.R.’s] person despite no Area Agency on Aging observ[ations] 
inside  their  home;  only  one  caretaker  witness  who  observed 
William  Cardwell  and  [I.M.R.]  together  inside  the  home  over  a 
span of a few months; and [evidence that I.M.R.] walk[ed] away 
from  the  home  on  one  brief  occasion  three  months  before  the 
guardianship petition was filed? 

. Did the [orphans’] court abuse its discretion or make an error 
of  law  when  it  failed  to  appoint  William  Cardwell  as  guardian  of 
[I.M.R.’s] estate in light of four witnesses and the estate planning 
documents  presented  clearly  stating  [I.M.R.’s]  desired  intention 
for William Cardwell to inherit everything from her and the ability 
to make gifts to himself? 

. Did the [orphans’] court abuse its discretion or make an error 
of law when it voided the deed signed by William Cardwell in light 
of the fact  that the Area Agency on  Aging never requested that

William Cardwell be removed as power of attorney of [I.M.R.] and 
the court did not remove him prior to signing the deed?[1] 
 

Appellant’s brief at 4-6 (cleaned up) (unnecessary capitalization omitted).  

 

At the outset, we consider whether Appellant has waived his claims by 

failing to comply with Rule 1925(b).  Generally, an appellant’s failure to timely 

comply  with  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(b)  will  result  in  waiver  of  the  issues  raised  on 

appeal.  See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vii) (“Issues not included in the Statement 

and/or not raised in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) 

are waived.”). 

There  is  no  dispute  that  Appellant  filed  an  untimely  Rule  1925(b) 

statement.    Pursuant  to  the  orphans’  court’s  Rule  1925(b)  order,  the 

statement  was  required  to  be  filed  with  the  clerk  of  the  orphans’  court  and 

served upon the orphans’ court judge by May 26, 2022, twenty-one days after 

the entry of the order.  Appellant filed the statement on May 31, 2022, five 

days  late.    It  is  unclear  when,  if  ever,  Appellant  served  the  Rule  1925 

statement upon the orphans’ court judge.   

Nevertheless, before this Court may find waiver under Rule 1925(b), we 

must  determine  whether  the  orphans’  court’s  Rule  1925(b)  order  complied

of land stating that “if there was a valid power of attorney, the alleged agent 
has  failed  to  act  in  good  faith  and  failed  to  act  loyally  for  the  principal’s 
benefit.”    Orphans’  Court  Order, 4/7/22.  As Appellant  failed to appeal  that 
order, this Court will not address it or the propriety of the deed referenced in 
Appellant’s statement of questions presented.

strictly  with  the  requirements  of  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(b)(3).    See  e.g.,  Rahn  v. 

Consol. Rail Corp., 254 A.3d 738, 745-46 (Pa.Super. 2021).  In the case at 

bar, the orphans’ court’s order stated: 

AND NOW, this 5th day of May, 2022, having filed a Notice 
of Appeal in the above-captioned matter, [Appellant] is directed 
to file of record  a Statement of  Errors Complained of on Appeal 
within twenty-one (21) days from this date.  Said Statement shall 
be filled of record with the Clerk of the Orphans’ Court and served 
on this Court and opposing counsel.  Any issue not properly raised 
shall be deemed waived.  

rder, 5/5/22.  Significantly, the orphans’ court neglected to “specify . . . both

which the appellant can mail the Statement.”  See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(3)(iii).2

within which the appellant must file and serve the Statement; 

ii) that the Statement shall be filed of record; 

iii) that the Statement shall be served on the judge pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) and both the place the appellant can serve 
the  Statement  in  person  and  the  address  to  which  the

appellant to serve the Statement on the judge; and

____________________________________________ 

2  Rule 1925(b)(3) provides:  
 

J-A23044-22 

Our  decision  in  Rahn  is  instructive.    In  declining  to  find  waiver  in  a 

similar,  but  admittedly  different  situation  that  involved  the  failure  to 

simultaneously  serve  upon  the  trial  court  a  timely-filed  Rule  1925(b) 

statement, we first observed that “in determining whether an appellant has 

waived his issues on appeal based on non-compliance with Pa.R.A.P. 1925, it 

is the trial court’s order that triggers an appellant’s obligation . . . therefore, 

we  look  first  to  the  language  of  that  order.”    Id.  at  746-47  (quoting  In  re 

Estate  of  Boyle,  77  A.3d  674,  676  (Pa.Super.2013)).    Thereafter,  we 

reasoned that the failure to serve a Rule 1925(b) statement on the trial court 

did not warrant waiver because the trial court’s Rule 1925(b) order neglected 

to identify the address to serve the statement on the trial court judge.  Id. at 

747  (“[T]he  trial  judge  failed  to  follow  the  express  requirement  of  the 

amended Rule 1925(b) to provide [the appellant] with specific information on 

how to serve his 1925(b) statement. . . .  In light of these defects in the order, 

we decline to quash the appeal.”).   

Instantly,  the  orphans’  court  order,  like  the  order  in  Rahn,  did  not 

conform  with  Rule  1925(b)(3)(iii)’s  requirement  to  identify  “the  address  to 

which the appellant can mail the Statement.”  Hence, Appellant’s failure to file 

a  timely  Rule  1925(b)  concise  statement  is  not  grounds  to  find  waiver 

pursuant to Rule 1925(b)(4)(vii).   

While Rahn involved a slightly different situation concerning improper 

service of a timely filed statement, this is a difference without distinction, and 

- 6 - 

J-A23044-22 

the  rule  expressed  in  Rahn  requiring  a  non-defective  Rule  1925(b)  order 

applies in the present case.  Our perspective is buttressed by the Note to Rule 

1925, which emphasizes that Subparagraph (b)(3) “specifies what the judge 

must advise appellants when ordering a Statement.”   Pa.R.A.P. 1925, Note 

(emphasis  added).    Instantly,  the  court  was  required  to,  inter  alia,  identify 

both the location to serve the statement in person and the address to mail it.  

It  provided  neither.    To  excuse  the  orphans’  court’s  omission  in  support  of 

finding  waiver  in  this  case  would  be  inequitable.    See  Boyle  v.  Main  Line 

Health, Inc., 272 A.3d 466 (Pa.Super. 2022) (non-precedential decision at 

11  n.8)  (explaining,  “Where  the  trial  court’s  order  is  inconsistent  with  the 

requirements  of  Rule  1925(b)(3)(iii),  we  hold  that  the  waiver  provisions  of 

subsection  (b)(4)(vii)  do  not  apply.    It  would  be  fundamentally  unfair  to 

require appellants to strictly comply with the requirements of Rule 1925, but 

not require the same diligence from the trial court requesting a Rule 1925(b) 

statement.”).   

As  the  orphans’  court’s  Rule  1925(b)  order  is  facially  deficient,  we 

conclude  that  Appellant’s  failure  to  file  a  Rule  1925(b)  statement  did  not 

render his claims waived on appeal.  However, rather than attempt to address 

the merits of the six issues that are both asserted in Appellant’s May 31, 2022 

Rule  1925(b)  statement  and  raised  on  appeal  without  the  orphans’  court’s 

explanation of its reasons for fashioning the guardianship order, we direct the 

- 7 - 

J-A23044-22 

orphans’ court to draft a supplemental opinion  that outlines the reasons for 

its order or specifies where in the record such reasons may be found.3 

Accordingly,  we  remand  this  case  to  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  of 

Huntingdon County for issuance of an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).  

The  orphans’  court  shall  file  its  Rule  1925(a)  opinion  within  thirty  days  of 

receipt of the certified record.   

Remanded with instructions.  Jurisdiction retained.   

Judge McCaffery joins this Memorandum. 

P.J.E. Stevens files a Dissenting Statement. 

____________________________________________ 

3    In  addition  to  finding  all  of  Appellant’s  issues  waived  pursuant  to  Rule 
1925(b),  the  orphans’  court  provided  the  alternate  rationale  that  “the 
extensive  record  in  this  matter  speaks  for  itself  and  establishes  beyond  a 
reasonable  doubt  that  [I.M.R.]  is  both  incapacitated  and  in  need  of  an 
independent guardian of her person and estate (i.e., an entity person other 
than  [Appellant.]”).    Orphans’  Court  Rule  1925(a)  Opinion,  5/27/22,  at  2.  
Contrary  to  the  orphans’  court’s  assertion,  the  general  reference  to  the 
certified record is an inadequate explanation of the reasons for its order and 
fails to address Appellant’s specific contentions.  At a minimum, Rule 1925(a) 
requires that the court “specify where in the record where such reasons may 
be found.”  Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).
