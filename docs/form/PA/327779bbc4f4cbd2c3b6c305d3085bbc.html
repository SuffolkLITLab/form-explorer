EFORE:  HONORABLE RENÉE COHN JUBELIRER, President Judge 

HONORABLE ANNE E. COVEY, Judge 
HONORABLE LORI A. DUMAS, Judge 

PINION NOT REPORTED 

EMORANDUM OPINION  

BY JUDGE DUMAS 

 

 

 

 

 

   FILED: March 17, 2023 

Ian Neyman (Petitioner) has petitioned pro se for this Court’s review 

of an order issued by the Secretary of Human Services, of the Department of Human 

Services (the Department), which denied Petitioner’s application for reconsideration 

of an underlying adjudication.  We affirm.  

I. BACKGROUND1 

Petitioner is a member of Health Plan Partners (HPP), a managed care 

organization (MCO) contracted to provide medical services to Pennsylvania Medical 

Assistance Program recipients through the HealthChoices Program administered by 

the Department.  On November 23, 2020, Petitioner’s dental provider submitted a 

dental claim form and requested a benefit limit exception (BLE) for nerve treatment, 

post, and crown, i.e., a root canal.  HPP denied Petitioner’s request for a BLE.  HPP 

reasoned that Petitioner’s documentation did not show that he had a serious health 

1 Except as stated otherwise, we derive this background from the adjudication issued by 

the administrative law judge (ALJ).  ALJ’s Adjudication, 3/17/21.

condition; that his health would be at risk if the service was not approved; or that the 

service was medically necessary.  Petitioner timely filed a grievance review but was 

denied relief.   

 

 

Thereafter, Petitioner requested a fair hearing2 before an ALJ.  At the 

hearing, the Department presented the testimony of Chava Kintisch, a compliance 

specialist;  Dr.  William  Celko,  a  dental  consultant;  and  Dr.  Sanjay  Dabral,  the 

medical  director  for  HPP.    Notes  of  Testimony  (N.T.)  Hr’g,  3/2/21,  at  9,  11-26.  

Petitioner testified on his own behalf and did not present witnesses.  Id. at 30. 

On March 17, 2021, the ALJ denied relief.  Although the ALJ found 

that  Petitioner  credibly  testified  that  he  had  undergone  the  root  canal  procedure 

because  he  was  in  pain,  the  ALJ  credited  expert  testimony  that  Petitioner’s  BLE 

request was neither medically necessary3 nor cost effective.  On that same date, the 

Chief ALJ affirmed the adjudication.  See Final Admin. Action Order, 3/17/21 (Final 

Order). 

 

2 Recipients of medical assistance have the right to appeals and fair hearings.  See 55 Pa. 
Code § 275.1(a).  The objectives of fair hearings are to “afford [recipients] an opportunity for an 
impartial,  objective  review  of  decisions,  actions  and  delays,  or  in  actions  made  by  County 
Assistance Offices and the Department”; “settle the issue or issues raised by the client in requesting 
a  hearing  and  to  produce  a  clear  and  definitive  decision  setting  forth  the  findings  of  the 
Department”; “contribute to uniformity in the application of Departmental regulations”; and “[t]o 
reveal  aspects  of  Departmental  regulations  that  are  deficient,  inequitable,  or  constitute  a 
misconstruction of law.”  See 55 Pa. Code § 275.1(b). 

3 In this context, medically necessary is defined as “[a] service, item, procedure or level of 
care” that is “[c]ompensable under the [medical assistance] program,” “[n]ecessary to the proper 
treatment  or  management  of  an  illness,  injury  or  disability[,]”  and  “[p]rescribed,  provided,  or 
ordered by an appropriate licensed practitioner in accordance with accepted standards of practice.”  
See 55 Pa. Code § 1101.21. 

2 

 

 

 

On  March  22,  2021,  Petitioner  timely  filed  an  application  for 

reconsideration  by  the  Department.4    On  April  21,  2021,  the  application  was 

considered denied by operation of law.5  On June 8, 2021, the Department issued an 

order  notifying  Petitioner  of  the  denial.    See  Order  Den.  Recons.,  6/8/21 

(Reconsideration Order).6 

On June 22, 2021, Petitioner pro se filed correspondence that the Court 

treated as an attempt to petition for review.  See Correspondence, 6/22/21, at 1-3.  

Petitioner attached copies of both the Final Order and the  Reconsideration Order.  

See id.  Thereafter, Petitioner filed a petition for review, which this Court docketed 

at No. 798 C.D. 2021.   

Upon review, the Court determined that Petitioner’s merits appeal “may 

be  untimely”  and  directed  the  parties  to  address  the  issue.    Cmwlth.  Ct.  Order, 

Docket No. 798 C.D. 2021, 8/26/21, at 1.  The Court further ordered that: (1) June 

22, 2021, was the effective date of the filing of the appeal at Docket No. 798 C.D. 

2021; (2) the appeal docketed at No. 798 C.D. 2021 was deemed to be from the Final 

Order; (3) if Petitioner wished to appeal the Reconsideration Order, he must file a 

separate petition for review within 30 days; and (4) June 22, 2021, was preserved as 

the appeal date of the  Reconsideration Order.  See id. at 1-2.  As directed by the 

Court, Petitioner timely filed the instant petition, challenging the Reconsideration 

 

4 The application for reconsideration was post-marked March 22, 2021, and received on 
March 25, 2021.  It appears that the Department erroneously noted March 25, 2021, as the receipt 
date in the certified record, but the correct receipt date of March 22, 2021, while calculating the 
time for denial by operation of law.  See, e.g., 55 Pa. Code § 275.61(a)(1). 

5 See 1 Pa. Code § 35.241(d). 
6 The Reconsideration Order stated: (1) the application was deemed denied by operation of 
law on April 21, 2021; and (2) Petitioner could appeal to this Court within thirty days from the 
date of the order, i.e., June 8, 2021.  See Recons. Order, 6/8/21.

Order.    Upon  receipt,  the  prothonotary  of  this  Court  created  a  separate  action  at 

Docket No. 1118 C.D. 2021.   

On March 22, 2022, the Department filed an application to dismiss for 

lack of jurisdiction Petitioner’s appeal from the Final Order.  See Appl. to Dismiss, 

Cmwlth. Ct. Nos. 798, 1198 C.D. 2021, 3/22/22, at 1-3.  On May 3, 2022, this Court 

granted  the  Department’s  application  and  dismissed  Petitioner’s  appeal  from  the 

Final Order as untimely.  Mem & Order, Cmwlth. Ct. Nos. 798, 1118 C.D. 2021, 

5/3/22.7  However, our decision therein did not impact the matter presently before 

the Court.8   

II. ISSUES 

Petitioner asks why the Department denied his request that HPP provide 

coverage for his root canal treatment.  Pet’r’s Br. at 6.  In response, the Department 

contends  that  the  Reconsideration  Order,  informing  Petitioner  of  the  denial  of 

 

7 Petitioner sought to appeal the Final Order 97 days after it issued.  Appellate review of a 
quasi-judicial order shall be filed with the appellate court within 30 days after the date of the entry 
of the order.  See Pa. R.A.P. 1512(a)(1).  An application to reconsider does not extend this period.  
Fleeher v. Dep’t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 850 A.2d 34, 36 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004); 1 
Pa. Code § 35.241(e), (f).  Thus, it was untimely. 

8 This matter has been complicated by procedural irregularities that may have contributed 
to confusion of the parties, particularly Petitioner, who has navigated the rather Byzantine system 
administering his healthcare and ultimately requesting relief from this Court without the benefit of 
counsel.  Because of the way Petitioner filed documents in this Court, it was assigned two separate 
docket numbers and, thus, proceeded in disjointed fashion.   

At Docket No. 798 C.D. 2021, this Court considered Petitioner’s substantive appeal from 
the Final Order issued by the Department. The Final Order denied Petitioner’s request that HPP 
provide coverage for his root canal treatment.  Because Petitioner did not request appellate relief 
from this Court in timely fashion, we were constrained to dismiss his appeal because we lacked 
jurisdiction to consider the merits.  In other words, we lacked authority to consider Petitioner’s 
appeal.   

At  Docket  No.  1118  C.D.  2021,  the  matter  presently  before  this  Court,  we  consider 
Petitioner’s further appeal from the Reconsideration Order.  As we will discuss in some further 
detail  below, our review of the Reconsideration Order is  far more limited than a  review of the 
substantive merits of the Department’s decision to deny Petitioner’s request for coverage. 

4 

reconsideration by operation of law, is not subject to judicial review because it issued 

beyond the 30-day period for appeals.  See Resp’t’s Br. at 9.  Absent this alleged 

procedural  flaw,  the  Department  asserts  in  the  alternative  that  Petitioner  has  not 

asserted  either  bad  faith  or  an  abuse  of  the  Department’s  discretion  in  denying 

reconsideration  of  the  Final  Order.    See  id.  at  11-13.    Thus,  according  to  the 

Department, no relief is due.  See id. at 14. 

III. DISCUSSION 

A. Petitioner’s Appeal may Proceed 

 

 

Initially,  we  must  determine  whether  we  have  jurisdiction  to  review 

Petitioner’s appeal from the Reconsideration Order.  Following a hearing decision, 

either party may request reconsideration provided that such request is postmarked 

within 15 days of the decision.  55 Pa. Code § 275.61; see also 1 Pa. Code § 35.241 

(relating to application for rehearing or reconsideration).  If such request is denied, 

the party may appeal the denial of reconsideration within 30 days.   42 Pa. C.S. § 

5105(a)(2); Pa. R.A.P. 1512(a)(1). 

Generally, if a timely application for reconsideration is filed, an agency 

has 30 days from the date of the filing to act on the request.  1 Pa. Code § 35.241(d).  

If the agency does not  act  on the application,  it shall be  deemed denied.   See id.  

Further,  where  the  agency  does  not  act  on  such  a  request  within  the  prescribed 

period,  it  loses  jurisdiction  over  the  request,  “and  any  action  taken  beyond  the 

[prescribed] period [is] null and void.”  See Ciavarra v. Com., 970 A.2d 500, 503 

(Pa. Cmwlth. 2009); see also Colonial Manor Pers. Care Boarding Home v. Dep’t 

of  Pub.  Welfare,  551  A.2d  347,  350  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  1988)  (stating  that  an 

administrative order issued after a deemed denial of reconsideration is “a nullity . . .  

[with] nothing to appeal”). 

5 

 

 

 

 

Here,  the  Department  did  not  act  on  Petitioner’s  application  for 

reconsideration  within  the  prescribed  period.    Per  the  rules  set  forth  above,  the 

application was deemed denied by operation of law on April 21, 2021.  Therefore, 

Petitioner had until May 21, 2021, to appeal the deemed denial of reconsideration.  

42 Pa. C.S. § 5105(a)(2); Pa. R.A.P. 1512(a)(1).  He failed to do so. 

Thereafter, on June 8, 2021, the Department issued the Reconsideration 

Order.  However, because the Reconsideration Order issued after the Department 

lost  jurisdiction  to  entertain  Petitioner’s  application,  the  Reconsideration  Order 

constitutes a legal nullity.  See Ciavarra, 970 A.2d at 500; Colonial Manor Pers. 

Care  Boarding  Home,  551  A.2d  at  350.    It  would  appear  that  the  Department  is 

correct  that  its  denial  of  reconsideration  is  not  subject  to  judicial  review  by  this 

Court.  See Colonial Manor Pers. Care Boarding Home, 551 A.2d at 350.    

However, that does not end our inquiry.  In limited circumstances, this 

Court  may  consider  appeals  nunc  pro  tunc  from  the  decisions  of  administrative 

bodies.  See Harris v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Rev., 247 A.3d 1223, 1229 (Pa. 

Cmwlth. 2021).  “An appeal nunc pro tunc is only warranted . . . in extraordinary 

circumstances involving fraud or some breakdown in the court’s operation, or where 

the delay is caused by non-negligent circumstances either by the claimant or a third 

party.”    See  id.  (internal  citations  and  quotations  omitted).    An  administrative 

breakdown occurs when “an administrative body acts negligently, improperly or in 

a misleading way.”  Union Elec. Corp. v. Bd. of Prop. Assessment, Appeals & Rev., 

746 A.2d 581, 584 (Pa. 2000).   

As noted above, the Department’s Reconsideration Order incorrectly 

informed Petitioner that he could appeal to this Court “within thirty (30) days from 

the  date  of  this  [Reconsideration]  Order.”    Recons.  Order.    This  misinformation 

6 

constitutes an administrative breakdown.  See Union Elec. Corp., 746 A.2d at 584. 

Without  the  benefit  of  counsel,  Petitioner  took  the  Department  at  its  word  and 

promptly filed his petition for review from the Reconsideration Order on June 22, 

2021.  Accordingly, we consider Petitioner’s appeal.  Harris, 247 A.3d at 1229. 

B. Petitioner is Due No Relief 

 

 

Petitioner asserts that the Department erred in denying him coverage 

for the root canal.  See Pet’r’s Br. at 8-10.  He maintains that he “desperately needed 

the  [root  canal] procedure  and  did  not  want  [his]  tooth  extracted.”    Id.  at 10.    In 

summarizing  his  argument,  Petitioner  proposes  an  analogy:  “if  my  finger  were 

infected would [HPP] argue in favor of having that finger amputated?”  Id. at 8.9  

Petitioner’s  assertion  of  error  goes  to  the  merits  of  the  Department’s  underlying 

adjudication.  See Final Order at 6-7 (concluding that HPP was correct in denying 

Petitioner’s request for coverage). 

It is well settled that we may not review the merits of an adjudication 

when a petition for review has been filed more than 30 days after the date of the 

adjudication.  Fleeher, 850 A.2d at 36; Muehleisen v. State Civ. Serv. Comm’n, 443 

A.2d 867 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1982), aff’d, 461 A.2d 615 (Pa. 1983).  Rather, our review 

is limited to the Department’s denial of reconsideration.  Fleeher, 850 A.2d at 36.  

“The  decision  to  grant  or  deny  a  request  for  reconsideration  is  a  matter  of 

 

9  Petitioner’s  brief  is  inadequate.    He  cites  no  case  law  and  does  not  develop  a  legal 
argument.  Accordingly, he risks waiver.  See Pa. R.A.P. 2119(a) (“The argument shall be divided 
into as many parts as there are questions to be argued; and shall have at the head of each part . . . 
the particular point treated therein, followed by such discussion and citation of authorities as are 
deemed  pertinent.”);  Commonwealth  v.  Spotz,  716  A.2d  580,  585  n.5  (Pa.  1998)  (holding  that 
failure to develop issue in appellate brief results in waiver); Browne v. Dep’t of Transp., 843 A.2d 
429,  435  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  2004)  (“At  the  appellate  level,  a  party’s  failure  to  include  analysis  and 
relevant authority results in waiver.”).  Nevertheless, because we are generally inclined to construe 
pro se filings liberally, we decline to find waiver in this case.  See, e.g., Richardson v. Pa. Ins. 
Dep’t, 54 A.3d 420, 425-29 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2012).   

7 

administrative  discretion  and,  as  such,  will  only  be  reversed  for  an  abuse  of 

discretion.”   Id.    An abuse of  discretion is more than an  error of judgment.   The 

decision must be manifestly unreasonable, constitute an error or misapplication of 

law, or result from partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will.  Payne v. Workers’ Comp. 

Appeal Bd. (Elwyn, Inc.), 928 A.2d 377, 380 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2007).     

Petitioner’s  passionate  assertion  of  error,  without  more,  does  not 

establish  an  abuse  of  discretion.    See  id.    Petitioner  does  not  assert  an  error  or 

misapplication of the law; he does not accuse the Department of partiality, prejudice, 

bias,  or  ill  will;  nor  does  Petitioner  articulate  any  legal  basis  for  this  Court  to 

conclude  that  the  Department’s  denial  of  reconsideration  was  manifestly 

unreasonable.  See generally Pet’r’s Br.   

Similarly,  our  review  of  Petitioner’s  application  for  reconsideration 

reveals no grounds for further action by the Department.  In response to instructions 

from the Department to identify a policy, regulation, or law misapplied during his 

administrative appeal, Petitioner recounted factual reasons for his belief that a root 

canal  procedure  was  appropriate.    See  Appl.  for  Recons.,  3/5/21,  at  1-2 

(unpaginated).   

IV. CONCLUSION 

For  these  reasons,  Petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  an  abuse  of  the 

Department’s discretion and is due no relief.  Payne, 928 A.2d at 381; Fleeher, 850

reconsideration.10 

     

 
 

 

10 As we have stated repeatedly, the merits of the Department’s underlying adjudication 
are not properly before this Court.  Nevertheless, we briefly note the following.  Petitioner’s dental 
provider requested a benefit limit exception (BLE) for the root canal procedure because it was “a 
cost-effective  alternative.”    Ex.  C-5  (“BLE  Request  Form,”  11/12/20).    The  provider  did  not 
indicate that Petitioner suffered from a “serious chronic illness or other serious health condition” 
such that denial of the BLE would jeopardize his life or result in the serious deterioration of his 
health.  Id.  At Petitioner’s hearing, Dr. William Celko testified as a dental consultant on behalf of 
HPP.    Dr.  Celko  noted  the  absence  of  evidence  suggesting  that  Petitioner  had  a  serious  health 
condition  or  that  the  root  canal  procedure  was  medically  necessary.    See  N.T.  Hr’g  at  22-23.  
Further,  Dr.  Celko  testified  specifically  that  a  “root  canal  .  .  .  is  certainly  not  a  cost-effective 
advantage treatment alternative in lieu or instead of an extraction process.”  Id. at 23.  Dr. Sanjay 
Dabral,  a  medical  director  with  HPP,  similarly  testified  that  the  procedure  was  not  medically 
necessary.  Id. at 27.  In response, Petitioner testified that he was in “excruciating pain” and was 
worried that an “infection would spread throughout [his] body.”  Id. at 30.  Thus, in Petitioner’s 
view, he “had absolutely no recourse other than to get that emergency root canal.”  Id.  However, 
Petitioner  provided  no  medical  evidence  to  support  his  testimony.  Specifically  absent  from 
Petitioner’s testimony or from other evidence introduced was any explanation or justification for 
the provider’s assertion that the root canal procedure was a cost-effective alternative to extraction.  
Thus, even if we were to review the merits of the underlying adjudication, we would discern neither 
error  nor  abuse  of  discretion  in  the  ALJ’s  conclusion  that  Petitioner’s  request  for  a  BLE  was 
properly denied.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
