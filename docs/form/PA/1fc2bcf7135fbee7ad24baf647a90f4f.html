Appellant 

 No. 280 WDA 2022 

Appeal from the Order Entered February 18, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Venango County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-61-CR-0000545-2018 

EFORE:  BENDER, P.J.E., OLSON, J., and KUNSELMAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY BENDER, P.J.E.:  

 

FILED:  March 23, 2023 

 

Appellant,  Travis  John  Berry,  appeals  pro  se  from  the  trial  court’s 

February  18,  2022  order  denying  his  “Motion  to  Enforce  Plea  Agreement” 

(hereinafter,  “Motion”).    Appellant  alleges  that  his  plea  agreement  was  for 

concurrent sentences on all counts, which the court allegedly violated when it 

imposed a sentence on one of his counts to run consecutively.  After careful 

review, we affirm. 

The  facts  underlying  Appellant’s  convictions  are  not  pertinent  to  our 

disposition of his present appeal.  We need only note that on December 17, 

2018,  Appellant  pled  guilty  to  one  count  of  terroristic  threats,  18  Pa.C.S.  § 

2706(a)(1), and two counts of recklessly endangering another person (REAP), 

18 Pa.C.S. § 2701(a)(1).  On January 4, 2019, the court imposed a sentence 

of  9  to 60  months’  incarceration  for  his  terroristic  threats  conviction,  and  a 

term of 9 to 24 months’ incarceration for each of his two REAP offenses.  The 

     

    T

   

 

 

  B

  

J-A29012-22  

J-A29012-22 

court  directed  that  Appellant’s  REAP  sentences  run  concurrently  to  one 

another,  and  consecutively  to  his  sentence  for  terroristic  threats.    Thus, 

Appellant’s aggregate term of incarceration is 18 to 84 months. 

On January 11, 2019, Appellant filed  a  pro se  motion to withdraw his 

guilty plea, arguing that he “did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently 

enter  into  a  plea  agreement  in  which  …  he  was  sentenced  to  consecutive 

sentences.”    Motion  to  Withdraw  Guilty  Plea,  1/11/19,  at  1  (single  page).  

However,  on  February  6,  2019,  Appellant  moved  to  withdraw  that  motion, 

stating that “he no longer wishe[d] to withdraw his plea of guilty….”  Motion 

to Withdraw Withdrawal, 2/6/19, at 1 (single page).   

On  February  6,  2019,  Appellant  also  filed  a  pro  se  motion  for 

reconsideration  of  his  sentence,  asking  for  a  “concurrent  sentence  on  all 

counts … instead of consecutive.”   Motion for Reconsideration, 2/6/19, at 1 

(single  page).    On  March  8,  2019,  the  court  issued  an  order  denying  that 

motion on the basis that it was untimely filed.  Appellant did not file a direct 

appeal. 

Instead, on December 23, 2019, Appellant filed a pro se petition under 

the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546, alleging that 

his  trial  counsel  was  ineffective  for  “allow[ing]  the  plea  agreement  to  be 

changed  from  a  concurrent  sentence  to  a  consecutive  sentence,”  and  for 

failing  to  “advise  [Appellant]  to  withdraw  the  same….”    PCRA  Petition, 

12/23/19, at 10 (unnumbered).   Counsel was appointed and an evidentiary 

hearing  was  held.    On  March  2,  2021,  the  court  issued  an  order  denying 

- 2 - 

J-A29012-22 

Appellant’s  petition,  apparently  finding  no  arguable  merit  to  his  claim  that 

counsel  was  ineffective  for  not  objecting  to  his  consecutive  sentence  or 

advising Appellant to withdraw his plea.  Specifically, the court stated:   

[T]he plea agreement is clear on its face.[1]  [Appellant] was aware 
of the recommendation of the Commonwealth at sentencing prior 
to  being  sentenced.    [Appellant]  never  raised  the  issue  at 
sentencing that the Commonwealth was arguing against the plea 
agreement.    The  [c]ourt  did  follow  the  plea  agreement  and 
sentencing  …  [with  the REAP]  [c]ounts … being  concurrent, and 
this  [c]ourt  made  the  sentence  on  [terroristic  threats]  and  [the 
two REAP c]ounts consecutive.   

PCRA Court Order, 3/2/21, at 1 (single page).  Appellant filed a timely notice 

of appeal from this order, but then later filed a motion to withdraw that appeal, 

which this Court granted.  See Per Curiam Order, 5/7/21, at 1 (single page). 

 

On February 16, 2022, Appellant filed the Motion at issue in the present 

appeal.    Therein,  he  again  contended  that  his  plea  agreement  called  for 

concurrent  sentences  on  all  counts.    He  insisted  that  the  “written[,] 

contractual  plea  agreement”  was  explicitly  accepted  by  the  court  and  then 

violated  when  the  court  imposed  a  consecutive  sentence  for  his  terroristic-

threats offense.  See Motion, 2/16/22, at 2 (unnumbered).  On February 18, 

2022, the trial court issued an order denying Appellant’s Motion. 

 

On March 3, 2022, Appellant filed a timely, pro se notice of appeal.  The 

court thereafter ordered him to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of 

____________________________________________ 

1  The  written  plea  agreement  stated  the  sentencing  recommendation  as 
follows: “Standard [r]ange with counts [five] and [six] concurrent.”  Written 
Plea,  1/9/19,  at  1.    The  plea  lists  counts  five  and  six  as  Appellant’s  REAP 
charges.   

- 3 - 

J-A29012-22 

errors  complained  of  on  appeal,  and  Appellant  timely  complied.    The  court 

filed a Rule 1925(a) opinion on June 30, 2022.   

Herein, Appellant states two issues for our review: 

[I.] Did the [trial c]ourt err when it denied Appellant’s Motion…? 

[II.] Does Appellant’s plea agreement need [to be] enforced so he 
can get the full benefit of his plea bargain? 

Appellant’s Brief at 4. 

 

Preliminarily, we observe that,  

a PCRA petition, including a second or subsequent petition, shall 
be  filed  within  one  year  of  the  date  the  underlying  judgment  of 
sentence becomes final.  42 Pa.C.S.[] § 9545(b)(1).  A judgment 
of sentence is final “at the conclusion of direct review, including 
discretionary  review  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States 
and  the  Supreme  Court  of  Pennsylvania,  or  at  the  expiration  of 
time for seeking the review.”  42 Pa.C.S.[] § 9545(b)(3). 

A  petition  for  collateral  relief  will  generally  be  considered 
a PCRA petition if it raises issues cognizable under the PCRA.  See 
Commonwealth v. Peterkin, … 722 A.2d 638, 640 ([Pa.] 1998); 
42 Pa.C.S.[] § 9542 (stating [the] PCRA shall be [the] sole means 
of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common 
law  and  statutory  remedies  for  same  purpose).    The  plain 
language  of  the  PCRA  mandates  that  claims  which  could  be 
brought  under  the  PCRA,  must  be  brought  under  the  PCRA.  
Commonwealth v. Hall, 771 A.2d 1232, 1235 ([Pa.] 2001).   

“On  the  other  hand,  a  collateral  petition  to  enforce  a  plea 
agreement is regularly treated as outside the ambit of the PCRA 
and  under  the  contractual  enforcement  theory  of  specific 
performance.  The designation of the petition does not preclude a 
court 
from  deducing  the  proper  nature  of  a  pleading.”  
Commonwealth  v.  Kerns,  220  A.3d  607,  611-12  (Pa.  Super. 
2019) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

Further: “[T]he convicted criminal is entitled to the benefit of his 
bargain  through  specific  performance  of  the  terms  of  the  plea 
agreement.    Thus,  a  court  must  determine  whether  an  alleged 
term is part of the parties’ plea agreement.  If the answer to that 
inquiry  is  affirmative,  then  the  convicted  criminal  is  entitled  to 
specific performance of the term.”  Commonwealth v. Martinez, 
147  A.3d  517,  532-33  ([Pa.]  2016)  (some  internal  citations 
omitted). 

Commonwealth v. Snook, 230 A.3d 438, 443–45 (Pa. Super. 2020). 

 

Here, Appellant alleged in his Motion that his negotiated plea agreement 

mandated concurrent sentences for each of the counts to which he pled guilty 

and, because the court accepted that plea, it was bound to impose concurrent 

sentences.  Nevertheless, the trial court imposed a consecutive sentence for 

his  terroristic-threats offense,  thereby  violating the  terms  of the  negotiated 

plea agreement.  Appellant averred in his Motion that he is entitled to specific 

performance  of  the  plea  agreement  for  concurrent  sentences.    Because 

Appellant’s  Motion  sought  specific  performance  of  his  negotiated  plea 

agreement, we conclude that his claim is not cognizable under the PCRA or 

subject to the timeliness requirements thereof.  See id.  

 

Nevertheless,  no  relief  is  due.    Appellant’s  argument  that  his  plea 

agreement  called  for  concurrent  sentences  on  all  counts  is  waived.    In 

Commonwealth  v.  Parsons,  969  A.2d  1259,  1268  (Pa.  Super.  2009)  (en 

banc), this Court held that, “[a]ssuming the plea agreement is legally possible 

to fulfill, when the parties enter the plea agreement on the record, and the 

court accepts and approves the plea, then the parties and the court must abide 

by the terms of the plea.”  However,  

- 5 - 

J-A29012-22 

[t]o be clear, a trial court legally may impose a harsher sentence 
than  the  one  agreed  upon,  even  after  accepting  a  plea  with  a 
negotiated sentence.  Commonwealth v. Tann, 79 A.3d 1130, 
1133 (Pa. Super. 2013) (“Following the acceptance of a negotiated 
plea,  the  trial  court  is  not  required  to  sentence  a  defendant  in 
accordance with the plea agreement.  Such a sentence is legal, so 
long as it does not exceed the statutory maximum.”).  However, 
when it does so, the trial court must give the defendant the option 
to  withdraw  his  plea  and  proceed  to  trial.    Id.    (“[A]  criminal 
defendant who is sentenced to more than was agreed upon in a 
negotiated plea may withdraw his guilty plea upon being deprived 
of  the  benefit  of  his  bargain.”)  (citing  Commonwealth  v. 
Wallace, … 870 A.2d 838, 843 n.5 ([Pa.] 2005)). 

Commonwealth v. Root, 179 A.3d 511, 518 (Pa. Super. 2018). 

 

Here,  even  if  Appellant  is  correct  that  his  negotiated  plea  called  for 

concurrent sentences, the court’s acceptance of that plea still did not legally 

preclude  it  from  imposing  a  harsher,  consecutive  sentence  for  terroristic 

threats.  To challenge the imposition of that sentence as violative of the plea 

agreement,  or  seek  to  withdraw  his  plea  because  of  the  court’s  sentencing 

decision,  Appellant  was required to file a post-sentence motion to withdraw 

his plea or modify his sentence.   

Indeed, Appellant did file a post-sentence motion to withdraw his plea, 

asserting that the trial court’s sentence violated the terms of his negotiated 

plea  agreement  with  the  Commonwealth.    However,  he  then  withdrew  that 

motion  before  the  trial  court  could  rule  on  it.    Appellant  also  filed  a  post-

sentence  motion for  reconsideration of his  sentence, arguing for concurrent 

terms  of  incarceration,  but  that  motion  was  untimely.    Thus,  Appellant 

forfeited  the  opportunity  to  withdraw  his  plea  or  seek  sentencing 

- 6 - 

J-A29012-22 

reconsideration  on  the  basis  that  the  court’s  imposition  of  a  consecutive 

sentence violated the terms of his negotiated plea agreement.   

Appellant seemingly recognized this fact when he filed a PCRA petition 

asserting that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the court’s 

sentence  as  violative  of  Appellant’s  plea  agreement,  or  advise  Appellant  to 

move to withdraw his plea.  In rejecting this claim, the PCRA court found that 

Appellant’s sentence conformed to his negotiated plea agreement.  Appellant 

chose not to challenge that ruling on direct appeal.  

 

Based  on  this  record,  we  conclude  that  the  trial  court  did  not  err  in 

denying  Appellant’s  Motion.    Appellant  did  not  pursue  his  post-sentence 

motion to withdraw his plea,  or timely  challenge the court’s  imposition of a 

consecutive  term  of  incarceration  in  a  motion  for  reconsideration  of  his 

sentence.  He also failed to appeal when the PCRA court denied his request to 

withdraw his guilty plea after concluding that his sentence comports with his 

negotiated  plea  agreement.    Accordingly,  the  trial  court’s  purportedly 

sentencing  Appellant  more  harshly  than  the  negotiated  plea  agreement 

contemplated was legal, and there is no contrary plea agreement to enforce.

Order affirmed.
