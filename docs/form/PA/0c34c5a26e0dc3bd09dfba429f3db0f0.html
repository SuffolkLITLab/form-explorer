ADA 

Requirements

Effective Communication

Overview

The Department of Justice 

published revised final 

regulations implementing 

the Americans with 

Disabilities Act (ADA) for 

title II (State and local 

government services) 

and title III (public 

accommodations and 

commercial facilities) 

on September 15, 2010, 

in the Federal Register. 

These requirements, or 

rules, clarify and refine 

issues that have arisen 

over the past 20 years and 

contain new, and updated, 

requirements, including 

the 2010 Standards for 

Accessible Design (2010 

Standards). 

People who have vision, hearing, or speech disabilities 
(“communication disabilities”) use different ways to com-
municate. For example, people who are blind may give 
and receive information audibly rather than in writing 
and people who are deaf may give and receive informa-
tion through writing or sign language rather than through 
speech.

The ADA requires that title II entities (State and local govern-
ments) and title III entities (businesses and nonprofit organi-
zations that serve the public) communicate effectively with 
people who have communication disabilities. The goal is 
to ensure that communication with people with these dis-
abilities is equally effective as communication with people 
without disabilities. 

This publication is designed to help title II and title III enti-
ties (“covered entities”) understand how the rules for effec-
tive communication, including rules that went into effect on 
March 15, 2011, apply to them. 

•	 The purpose of the effective communication rules is to 
ensure that the person with a vision, hearing, or speech 
disability can communicate with, receive information 
from, and convey information to, the covered entity.

•	 Covered entities must provide auxiliary aids and services 
when needed to communicate effectively with people 
who have communication disabilities. 

•	 The key to communicating effectively is to consider 
the nature, length, complexity, and context of the 
communication and the person’s normal method(s) of 
communication. 

Effective Communication

•	 The rules apply to communicating 

with the person who is receiving the 
covered entity’s goods or services 
as well as with that person’s parent, 
spouse, or companion in appropriate 
circumstances.  

Auxiliary Aids and Services

The ADA uses the term “auxiliary aids and 
services” (“aids and services”) to refer to 
the ways to communicate with people who 
have communication disabilities. 

•	 For people who are blind, have vision 
loss, or are deaf-blind, this includes 
providing a qualified reader; information 
in large print, Braille, or electronically 
for use with a computer screen-reading 
program; or an audio recording of 
printed information. A “qualified” reader 
means someone who is able to read 
effectively, accurately, and impartially, 
using any necessary specialized 
vocabulary.

•	 For people who are deaf, have hearing 
loss, or are deaf-blind, this includes 
providing a qualified notetaker; a 
qualified sign language interpreter, oral 
interpreter, cued-speech interpreter, or 
tactile interpreter; real-time captioning; 
written materials; or a printed script 
of a stock speech (such as given on 
a museum or historic house tour) . A 
“qualified” interpreter means someone 
who is able to interpret effectively, 
accurately, and impartially, both 
receptively (i.e., understanding what the 
person with the disability is saying) and 
expressively (i.e., having the skill needed 

2   ADA Requirements

to convey information back to that 
person) using any necessary specialized 
vocabulary.

•	 For people who have speech disabilities, 
this may include providing a qualified 
speech-to-speech transliterator (a 
person trained to recognize unclear 
speech and repeat it clearly), especially 
if the person will be speaking at length, 
such as giving testimony in court, or just 
taking more time to communicate with 
someone who uses a communication 
board. In some situations, keeping 
paper and pencil on hand so the person 
can write out words that staff cannot 
understand or simply allowing more 
time to communicate with someone who 
uses a communication board or device 
may provide effective communication. 
Staff should always listen attentively 
and not be afraid or embarrassed to ask 
the person to repeat a word or phrase 
they do not understand.

In addition, aids and services include a wide 
variety of technologies including 1) assis-
tive listening systems and devices; 2) open 
captioning, closed captioning, real-time 
captioning, and closed caption decoders 
and devices; 3) telephone handset amplifi-
ers, hearing-aid compatible telephones, text 
telephones (TTYs), videophones, captioned 
telephones, and other voice, text, and 
video-based telecommunications products; 
4) videotext displays; 5) screen reader soft-
ware, magnification software, and optical 
readers; 6) video description and secondary 
auditory programming (SAP) devices that 
pick up video-described audio feeds for tele-
vision programs; 7) accessibility features in 
electronic documents and other electronic 

and information technology that is acces-
sible (either independently or through assis-
tive technology such as screen readers). 

Real-time captioning (also known as com-
puter-assisted real-time transcription, or 
CART) is a service similar to court reporting 
in which a transcriber types what is being 
said at a meeting or event into a computer 
that projects the words onto a screen. This 
service, which can be provided on-site or re-
motely, is particularly useful for people who 
are deaf or have hearing loss but do not use 
sign language. 

The free nationwide telecommunications 
relay service (TRS), reached by calling 
7-1-1, uses communications assistants (also 
called CAs or relay operators) who serve as 
intermediaries between people who have 
hearing or speech disabilities who use a 
text telephone (TTY) or text messaging and 
people who use standard voice telephones. 
The communications assistant tells the tele-
phone user what the other party is typing 
and types to tell the other party what the 
telephone user is saying. TRS also provides 
speech-to-speech transliteration for callers 
who have speech disabilities.

Video relay service (VRS) is a free, sub-
scriber-based service for people who use 
sign language and have videophones, 
smart phones, or computers with video 
communication capabilities. For outgoing 
calls, the subscriber contacts the VRS inter-
preter, who places the call and serves as an 
intermediary between the subscriber and 
a person who uses a standard voice tele-
phone. The interpreter tells the telephone 
user what the subscriber is signing and 
signs to the subscriber what the telephone 
user is saying.

Effective Communication

Video remote interpreting (VRI) is a fee-
based service that uses video conferencing 
technology to access an off-site interpreter 
to provide real-time sign language or oral 
interpreting services for conversations 
between hearing people and people who 
are deaf or have hearing loss. The new 
regulations give covered entities the choice 
of using VRI or on-site interpreters in situ-
ations where either would be effective. 
VRI can be especially useful in rural areas 
where on-site interpreters may be difficult 
to obtain. Additionally, there may be some 
cost advantages in using VRI in certain cir-
cumstances. However, VRI will not be effec-
tive in all circumstances. For example, it will 
not be effective if the person who needs the 
interpreter has difficulty seeing the screen 
(either because of vision loss or because 
he or she cannot be properly positioned to 
see the screen, because of an injury or other 
condition). In these circumstances, an on-
site interpreter may be required. 

If VRI is chosen, all of the following specific 
performance standards must be met: 

•	

real-time, full-motion video and 
audio over a dedicated high-speed, 
wide-bandwidth video connection 
or wireless connection that delivers 
high-quality video images that do 
not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or 
grainy images, or irregular pauses in 
communication;

•	 a sharply delineated image that is large 
enough to display the interpreter’s face, 
arms, hands, and fingers, and the face, 
arms, hands, and fingers of the person 
using sign language, regardless of his or 
her body position;

  ADA Requirements   3

Effective Communication

•	 a clear, audible transmission of voices; 

and

Other solutions may be needed where the 
information being communicated is more 
extensive or complex. For example: 

•	 adequate staff training to ensure quick 

set-up and proper operation. 

Effective Communication 
Provisions

Covered entities must provide aids and ser-
vices when needed to communicate effec-
tively with people who have communication 
disabilities. 

The key to deciding what aid or service is 
needed to communicate effectively is to 
consider the nature, length, complexity, and 
context of the communication as well as the 
person’s normal method(s) of communica-
tion. 

Some easy solutions work in relatively 
simple and straightforward situations. For 
example: 

•	

•	

In a lunchroom or restaurant, reading 
the menu to a person who is blind 
allows that person to decide what dish 
to order.

In a retail setting, pointing to product 
information or writing notes back and 
forth to answer simple questions about 
a product may allow a person who is 
deaf to decide whether to purchase the 
product. 

•	

•	

In a law firm, providing an accessible 
electronic copy of a legal document that 
is being drafted for a client who is blind 
allows the client to read the draft at 
home using a computer screen-reading 
program. 

In a doctor’s office, an interpreter 
generally will be needed for taking the 
medical history of a patient who uses 
sign language or for discussing a serious 
diagnosis and its treatment options.

A person’s method(s) of communication 
are also key. For example, sign language 
interpreters are effective only for people 
who use sign language. Other methods of 
communication, such as those described 
above, are needed for people who may have 
lost their hearing later in life and do not use 
sign language. Similarly, Braille is effec-
tive only for people who read Braille. Other 
methods are needed for people with vision 
disabilities who do not read Braille, such as 
providing accessible electronic text docu-
ments, forms, etc., that can be accessed by 
the person’s screen reader program.

Covered entities are also required to accept 
telephone calls placed through TRS and 
VRS, and staff who answer the telephone 
must treat relay calls just like other calls. 

Many deaf-blind individuals use support service providers (SSPs) to assist them 
in accessing the world around them. SSPs are not “aids and services” under the 
ADA. However, they provide mobility, orientation, and informal communication 
services for deaf-blind individuals and are a critically important link enabling them 
to independently access the community at large. 

4   ADA Requirements

The communications assistant will explain 
how the system works if necessary.

Remember, the purpose of the effective 
communication rules is to ensure that the 
person with a communication disability can 
receive information from, and convey infor-
mation to, the covered entity.  

Companions 

In many situations, covered entities commu-
nicate with someone other than the person 
who is receiving their goods or services. 
For example, school staff usually talk to a 
parent about a child’s progress; hospital 
staff often talk to a patient’s spouse, other 
relative, or friend about the patient’s condi-
tion or prognosis. The rules refer to such 
people as “companions” and require cov-
ered entities to provide effective communi-
cation for companions who have communi-
cation disabilities. 

The term “companion” includes any family 
member, friend, or associate of a person 
seeking or receiving an entity’s goods or 
services who is an appropriate person with 
whom the entity should communicate.  

Use of Accompanying Adults or 
Children as Interpreters

Historically, many covered entities have ex-
pected a person who uses sign language to 
bring a family member or friend to interpret 
for him or her. These people often lacked 
the impartiality and specialized vocabulary 
needed to interpret effectively and accu-
rately. It was particularly problematic to use 
people’s children as interpreters. 

Effective Communication

The ADA places responsibility for provid-
ing effective communication, including 
the use of interpreters, directly on covered 
entities. They cannot require a person to 
bring someone to interpret for him or her. 
A covered entity can rely on a companion 
to interpret in only two situations. 

(1) In an emergency involving an im-
minent threat to the safety or welfare 
of an individual or the public, an adult 
or minor child accompanying a person 
who uses sign language may be relied 
upon to interpret or facilitate commu-
nication only when a qualified inter-
preter is not available. 

(2) In situations not involving an im-
minent threat, an adult accompanying 
someone who uses sign language may 
be relied upon to interpret or facilitate 
communication when a) the individual 
requests this, b) the accompanying 
adult agrees, and c) reliance on the ac-
companying adult is appropriate under 
the circumstances. This exception does 
not apply to minor children. 

Even under exception (2), covered entities 
may not rely on an accompanying adult to 
interpret when there is reason to doubt the 
person’s impartiality or effectiveness. For 
example: 

•	

It would be inappropriate to rely on 
a companion to interpret who feels 
conflicted about communicating bad 
news to the person or has a personal 
stake in the outcome of a situation. 

•	 When responding to a call alleging 

spousal abuse, police should never rely 
on one spouse to interpret for the other 
spouse. 

  ADA Requirements   5

Effective Communication

Who Decides Which Aid  
or Service Is Needed?

When choosing an aid or service, title II enti-
ties are required to give primary consider-
ation to the choice of aid or service request-
ed by the person who has a communication 
disability. The state or local government 
must honor the person’s choice, unless it 
can demonstrate that another equally effec-
tive means of communication is available, 
or that the use of the means chosen would 
result in a fundamental alteration or in an 
undue burden (see limitations below) . If the 
choice expressed by the person with a dis-
ability would result 
in an undue burden 
or a fundamental 
alteration, the public 
entity still has an 
obligation to provide 
an alternative aid or 
service that provides 
effective communi-
cation if one is avail-
able. 

Title III entities are encouraged to consult 
with the person with a disability to discuss 
what aid or service is appropriate. The goal 
is to provide an aid or service that will be 
effective, given the nature of what is being 
communicated and the person’s method of 
communicating.  

Limitations 

Covered entities are required to provide aids 
and services unless doing so would result 
in an “undue burden,” which is defined as 
significant difficulty or expense. If a particu-

6   ADA Requirements

lar aid or service would result in an undue 
burden, the entity must provide another ef-
fective aid or service, if possible, that would 
not result in an undue burden. Determining 
what constitutes an undue burden will vary 
from entity to entity and sometimes from 
one year to the next. The impact of chang-
ing economic conditions on the resources 
available to an entity may also be taken into 
consideration in making this determination. 

State and local governments: in deter-
mining whether a particular aid or service 
would result in undue financial and admin-
istrative burdens, a title II entity should take 
into consideration the cost of the particular 

Covered entities may require reason-
able advance notice from people 
requesting aids or services, based on 
the length of time needed to acquire 
the aid or service, but may not impose 
excessive advance notice require-
ments. “Walk-in” requests for aids 
and services must also be honored to 
the extent possible. 

aid or service in 
light of all resourc-
es available to fund 
the program, ser-
vice, or activity and 
the effect on other 
expenses or opera-
tions. The decision 
that a particular aid 
or service would 
result in an undue 
burden must be 

made by a high level official, no lower than 
a Department head, and must include a 
written statement of the reasons for reach-
ing that conclusion. 

Businesses and nonprofits: in determining 
whether a particular aid or service would 
result in an undue burden, a title III entity 
should take into consideration the nature 
and cost of the aid or service relative to 
their size, overall financial resources, and 
overall expenses. In general, a business or 
nonprofit with greater resources is expected 
to do more to ensure effective communica-
tion than one with fewer resources. If the 

entity has a parent company, the admin-
istrative and financial relationship, as well 
as the size, resources, and expenses of the 
parent company, would also be considered. 

In addition, covered entities are not required 
to provide any particular aid or service in 
those rare circumstances where it would 
fundamentally alter the nature of the goods 
or services they provide to the public. In the 
performing arts, for example, slowing down 
the action on stage in order to describe the 
action for patrons who are blind or have 
vision loss may fundamentally alter the 
nature of a play or dance performance. 

 
Staff Training 

A critical and often overlooked component 
of ensuring success is comprehensive and 
ongoing staff training. Covered entities may 
have established good policies, but if front 
line staff are not aware of them or do not 
know how to implement them, problems 
can arise. Covered entities should teach 
staff about the ADA’s requirements for 
communicating effectively with people who 
have communication disabilities. Many local 
disability organizations, including Centers 
for Independent Living, conduct ADA train-
ings in their communities. The Depart-
ment’s ADA Information Line can provide 
local contact information for these organiza-
tions.
