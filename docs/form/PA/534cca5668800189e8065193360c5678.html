NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

NTONIO JUNIOR SERRANO       

 

Appellant 

 No. 949 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered March 7, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-39-CR-0003675-2018 

EFORE:  DUBOW, J., KUNSELMAN, J., and NICHOLS, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY DUBOW, J.: 

 

 

     FILED MARCH 20, 2023 

Appellant,  Antonio  Junior  Serrano,  appeals  pro  se  from  the  March  7, 

2022 order dismissing his first petition filed pursuant to the Post Conviction 

Relief Act (“PCRA”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-46. After careful review, we affirm. 

On July 20, 2020, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 15 to 30 years’ 

incarceration after a jury convicted him of Rape, Aggravated Indecent Assault, 

Indecent  Assault,  and  Terroristic  Threats  related  to  acts  he  perpetrated 

against his aunt. On August 6, 2021, this Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment 

of sentence. Commonwealth v. Serrano, 262 A.3d 472, 2021 WL 3465961 

(Pa. Super. filed Aug. 6, 2021) (non-precedential decision). Appellant failed 

to perfect an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.1 

____________________________________________ 

1 On September 21, 2021, Appellant filed an untimely petition for review with 
our Supreme Court. On October 4, 2021, the Court administratively closed the

v. 

 

 

     

    A

   

 

On September 20, 2021, Appellant pro se filed the instant PCRA Petition, 

his first. On December 9, 2021, the PCRA court appointed counsel. On January 

4,  2022,  counsel  filed  a  Turner/Finley2  no  merit  letter  and  petition  to 

withdraw as counsel.  

On  February  2,  2022,  the  PCRA  court  granted  counsel’s  request  to 

withdraw. On February 15, 2022, the court issued notice to Appellant of its 

intent to dismiss his petition without a hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. 

On March 7, 2022, the PCRA court dismissed Appellant’s petition.3 

Appellant timely filed a Notice of Appeal and both he and the PCRA court 

complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. In his brief, Appellant raises a litany of issues 

for our review, which we organize as follows: 

1.  Was  PCRA  counsel  ineffective  for  not  raising  trial  counsel’s 
ineffectiveness, for failing to: 

A.  Challenge  the  admission  of  prior  bad  acts  evidence  at 
Appellant’s trial? 

B. Introduce exculpatory DNA evidence? 

C.  Preserve  and  raise  a  challenge  to  the  weight  of  the 
evidence?  

appeal. Then, on October 12, 2021, Appellant filed a request for nunc pro tunc 
relief  in  the  Supreme  Court.  The  Court  again  administratively  closed  the 
appeal.  

 Commonwealth v. Turner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa. 1988), Commonwealth v. 
Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa. Super. 1988). 

 As discussed infra, Appellant filed an untimely response to the court’s Rule 
907 notice.

2. Did the PCRA court err by permitting counsel to withdraw based 
on an insufficient Turner/Finley letter? 

____________________________________________ 

- 2 - 

J-S43007-22 

. Did the PCRA court err by conducting an insufficient review of 

the record before dismissing Appellant’s petition?  

See Appellant’s Br. at 4, 10-32.4 

A. 

We review the denial of a PCRA Petition to determine whether the record 

supports the PCRA court’s findings and whether its order is otherwise free of 

legal  error.  Commonwealth  v.  Fears,  86  A.3d  795,  803  (Pa.  2014).  This 

Court grants great deference to the findings of the PCRA court if the record 

supports  them.  Commonwealth  v.  Boyd,  923  A.2d  513,  515  (Pa.  Super. 

2007). We give no such deference, however, to the court’s legal conclusions. 

Commonwealth v. Mullen, 267 A.3d 507, 511 (Pa. Super. 2021).  

Additionally,  an  appellant  must  “support  [his]  claims  with  pertinent 

discussion, with references to the record and with citation to legal authorities.” 

Commonwealth v. Hardy, 918 A.2d 766, 771 (Pa. Super. 2007). We “will 

not act as counsel and will not develop arguments on behalf of an appellant.” 

____________________________________________ 

4  Appellant  also  complains  that  because  the  Department  of  Corrections 
(“DOC”)  mail  procedures  require  the  use  of  Smart  Communications,  he 
received  the  PCRA  court’s  Rule  907  notice  late  and  he  could  not  file  his 
response until March 8, 2022, which was the day after the court dismissed his 
petition.  Appellant’s  Br.  at  11,  17-18.  In  his  Rule  907  response,  Appellant 
requested solely that the PCRA court appoint him new counsel or allow him 
“to  go  pro  se  with  a  stand  by  lawyer[.]”  Letter  response,  3/8/22,  at  1-2 
(unpaginated).  As  this  Court  has  recognized,  Pennsylvania  law  “forbids 
appointment of new counsel where a proper Turner[]/Finley no-merit letter 
has been accepted and counsel was permitted to withdraw.” Commonwealth 
v. Williams, 204 A.3d 489, 493 (Pa. Super. 2019) (citation omitted). Thus, 
even if the court has timely received Appellant’s response, it would not have 
changed the court’s disposition.

Id. Where briefing defects “impede our ability to conduct meaningful appellate 

review,  we  may  dismiss  the  appeal  entirely  or  find  certain  issues  to  be 

waived.”  Id.  See  also  Pa.R.A.P.  2101.  Appellant’s  pro  se  status  does  not 

relieve  him  of  the  obligation  to  comply  with  this  Court’s  briefing  rules. 

Commonwealth v. Blakeney, 108 A.3d 739, 766 (Pa. 2014). 

B. 

Appellant’s issue contains multiple allegations of layered ineffectiveness 

of  PCRA  and  trial  counsel.  Appellant’s  Br.  at  20-33.  The  law  presumes  that 

counsel  has  rendered  effective  assistance.  Commonwealth  v.  Rivera,  10 

A.3d  1276,  1279  (Pa.  Super.  2010).  “[T]he  burden  of  demonstrating 

ineffectiveness  rests  on  [A]ppellant.”  Id.  To  satisfy  this  burden,  Appellant 

must  plead  and  prove  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that:  “(1)  his 

underlying  claim  is  of  arguable  merit;  (2)  the  particular  course  of  conduct 

pursued by counsel did not have some reasonable basis designed to effectuate 

his interests; and, (3) but for counsel’s ineffectiveness, there is a reasonable 

probability that the outcome of the challenged proceeding would have been 

different.” Commonwealth v. Fulton, 830 A.2d 567, 572 (Pa. 2003).  

To  prevail  on  a  layered  ineffectiveness  claim,  Appellant  must  satisfy 

each element of the test “as to each layer of allegedly ineffective counsel[.]” 

Commonwealth  v.  Dennis,  17  A.3d  297,  302  (Pa.  2011).  Where  an 

appellant fails to meaningfully discuss and apply each of the three prongs of 

the  ineffectiveness  test,  we  will  deny  relief.  Commonwealth  v.  Reid,  259 

A.3d 395, 405 (Pa. 2021). 

- 4 - 

J-S43007-22 

Unfortunately,  Appellant’s  claims  are  universally  underdeveloped.  He 

does  not  address  any  of  the  three  prongs  of  the  ineffectiveness  test  with 

respect  to  trial  or  PCRA  counsels’  stewardship.  Additionally,  the  argument 

section of Appellant’s brief is devoid of citation to the notes of testimony and 

includes only two citations to the certified record. In short, despite presenting 

three allegations of layered ineffectiveness across thirteen pages of argument, 

Appellant has failed to develop his argument sufficiently and through the lens 

of  the  well-established  test  for  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.  We,  thus, 

deny relief.  

C. 

In  his  second  issue,  Appellant  alleges  that  the  PCRA  court  erred  by 

permitting PCRA counsel to withdraw from representation based on a deficient 

Turner/Finley letter. Appellant’s Br. at 13. He alleges that “a fair reading of 

[his]  defective  [pro  se  petition]  reveals  that  he  wished  to  raise  issues 

concerning challenges to the collection [and] admissibility of DNA evidence.” 

Id.  at  14.  In  essence,  Appellant  alleges  that  counsel  failed  to  satisfy  the 

dictates  of  Turner/Finley  by  not  addressing  this  issue  and,  therefore,  the 

court erred by permitting counsel to withdraw.  

 

As  is  relevant  to  this  case,  to  be  permitted  to  withdraw,  counsel’s 

Turner/Finley letter must, inter alia, list each issue the petitioner wished to 

have  reviewed  and  explain  why  the  petitioner’s  issues  are  meritless. 

Commonwealth v. Muzzy, 141 A.3d 509, 511 (Pa. Super. 2016).   

- 5 - 

J-S43007-22 

 

A  review  of  Appellant’s  pro  se  PCRA  Petition  and  counsel’s 

Turner/Finley letter proves that counsel complied with Turner/Finley and, 

therefore, Appellant’s claim is without merit. In his pro se petition, Appellant 

argued  that  the  Commonwealth  obtained  his  DNA  through  “entrapment.” 

PCRA  Petition,  9/20/21,  at  3.  Counsel  addressed  this  allegation  in  his 

Turner/Finley  letter,  explaining  that  an  entrapment  defense  provided  “no 

support” in Appellant’s case because the record is devoid of proof that a law 

enforcement officer induced Appellant to engage in criminal conduct.5 Motion 

to  Withdraw,  1/4/22,  at  Ex.  A,  pg.  3  (unpaginated).  Moreover,  counsel 

explained that “a sample of your bodily tissue was obtained through the use 

of a motion to compel DNA extraction[ based on probable cause provided by] 

your  [aunt’s]  statements  that  you  sexually  assaulted  her  and  the  forensic 

examination of her body following her disclosure of [the] abuse.” Id.  

Since  counsel  complied  with  the  dictates  of  Turner/Finley  by 

addressing  the  issue  Appellant  wished  to  have  reviewed,  it  was  within  the 

PCRA court’s discretion to permit counsel to withdraw. We discern no abuse 

of that discretion.  

In  his  final  issue,  Appellant  argues  that  the  PCRA  court  erred  by 

dismissing his petition without a hearing. Appellant’s Br. at 16-17. Appellant 

____________________________________________ 

5  See  18  Pa.C.S.  §  313(a)  (“[a]  public  law  enforcement  official  [commits] 
entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an 
offense,  he  induces  or  encourages  another  person  to  engage  in  conducting 
constitution such offense[.]”  

D.

J-S43007-22 

does not, however, explain why a hearing was necessary.6 Instead, he makes 

a generalized statement about “meritorious issues” and “cumulative” error: 

In this case, [Appellant] was deprived of a hearing on meritorious 
issues  concerning  the  cumulative  effect  of  trial  counsel  and 
appellate  counsel’s  errors,  because  the  PCRA  court  failed  to 
independently evaluate the [record]. 

Appellant’s Br. at 17.  

Appellant does not elaborate on what “meritorious issues” he raised, or 

what “cumulative” error counsel committed. As a result of Appellant’s failure 

to adequately develop this issue, it is waived.7 

Considering  the  above,  we  affirm  the  PCRA  court’s  order  dismissing 

Appellant’s petition without a hearing.  

Order affirmed.   

____________________________________________ 

6  A  petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  a  PCRA  hearing,  and  a  PCRA  court  has  the 
discretion  to  dismiss  a  petition  without  a  hearing  when  it  is  satisfied  “that 
there are no genuine issues concerning any material fact, the defendant is not 
entitled to post-conviction relief, and no legitimate purpose would be served 
by any further proceedings.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 907(1). 

  Moreover,  Appellant’s  claim  is  without  merit.  As  the  PCRA  court’s  opinion 
indicates, and our review of the record confirms, the PCRA court adequately 
considered  each  issue  Appellant  raised  before  dismissing  his  petition.  See 
PCRA Petition at 3; PCRA Ct. Op., 2/15/22, at 1 n.1. We discern no abuse of 
the PCRA court’s discretion in doing so.
