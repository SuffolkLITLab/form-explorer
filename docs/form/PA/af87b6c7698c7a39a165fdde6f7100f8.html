      <pre>JUDGE  

KELLY C.
WALL

Judge Kelly C. Wall assumed her judicial duties on the Court of Common Pleas of 
Montgomery County on January 4, 2010 and served as Administrative Judge of the Family 
Bench from 2013 through 2017. Judge Wall has presided over domestic matters, civil 
arguments, criminal and pre-immigration matters, as well as protection from abuse, sexual 
violence and intimidation cases.

Prior to becoming a judge, Ms. Wall was a partner in the law firm of Miller, Turetsky, Rule 
and McLennan for 15 years serving as a litigator in both state and federal courts in areas of 
civil, employment and family law to name a few. She also represented individuals and not-
for-profit corporations before the Board of Assessment and Appeals.

Throughout her career, Judge Wall has been an advocate for children and families and has 
lectured on several subjects including, but not limited to, women and children's legal rights, 
domestic law, domestic violence, and civil and employment law. She was a solicitor for the 
Office of Children and Youth and volunteered for the Montgomery County Child Advocacy 
Project representing children who were victims of physical, mental and sexual abuse. Judge 
Wall also volunteered her time as a Parent Advocate for the Office of Children and Youth, 
sat on the Governance Board of the Norristown Family Center, and provided free services 
to clients of both the Montgomery County Women's Center and Legal Aid of Southeastern 
PA.

Judge Wall worked with domestic violence agencies to educate and improve services 
for domestic and sexual violence in the educational, faith based and legal communities. 
Judge Wall collaborated with the Victim Services Center and Womenâ€™s Center to develop a 
program to train Montgomery County Court personnel, social service agencies, and school 
districts on the Protection Against Sexual Violence and Intimidation Act. Judge Wall also 
serves on the Domestic Violence Task Force and the Domestic Violence Legal Network 
and partnered with domestic violence agencies to produce a PFA Tutorial Video for victims 
of domestic violence.

Judge Wall created the Friend of the Court Program which utilized volunteer lawyers 
to facilitate settlements in custody, support and special relief in Protection from Abuse 
matters. Judge Wall initiated miscellaneous family orders and increased the use of civil-stay 
away orders to further encourage resolution of PFA matters.

In her role as Administrative Judge of the Family Bench, Judge Wall implemented several 
new programs to improve services in the Family Court system including, but not limited 
to, Motions' Court, discovery certification in Equitable Distribution matters and record 

hearings in support exceptions. Judge Wall's programs significantly shortened the time 
delay in scheduling litigants for court hearings.

Judge Wall is a member of the Montgomery Bar Association where she served on various 
committees from 1996 through her ascendency to the bench. She is active with the 
Pennsylvania Bar Association where she has served as a Delegate since 2006, and is 
currently a member of the PBA Judicial Administrative Committee and the Commission on 
Women in the Profession. Judge Wall has been a frequent lecturer for the Pennsylvania Bar 
Institute as well as various bar and community organizations on topics including, but not 
limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act, family law, civility and domestic violence. 
Judge Wall has been involved in the MBA Civics Education Program teaching 6th grade 
students about civics and the law since 2012.

Judge Wall currently sits on the Board of Merakey which provides services in the areas of 
Autism, Therapeutic Foster Care and Intellectual & Development Disabilities. In 2013, Judge 
Wall collaborated with law enforcement and autism spectrum disorder experts to develop 
the Montgomery County Autism Awareness Seminar to educate first responders and court 
personnel on the issues facing autistic children. In 2016 and 2017, Judge Wall presented 
seminars on Autism and Family Court to both Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties and 
presented a Town Hall forum for psychotherapists and the legal and judicial communities.

Judge Wall also serves on the Rachel and Troy Foundation which provides funding to 
agencies that educate, support and care for children and families who are victims of 
domestic abuse.

Judge Wall was active in her community and served as an elected Supervisor in 
Whitemarsh Township for 4 years where she presided over public safety issues and zoning 
and land use matters, and was actively involved with preserving nearly 200 acres of open 
space in one of the largest land conservation projects in Montgomery County. Judge 
Wall graduated from the Whitemarsh Township Citizens' Police Academy in 2010 and the 
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation Citizens' Academy in 2014.

In 2015, Judge Wall was inducted into the Plymouth Whitemarsh High School Class 
of 1975 Distinguished Graduates Organization for Public Service. In 2016, Judge Wall 
was presented the Montgomery County Victim Services Center Leadership Award, the 
Montgomery County Domestic Relations Child Support Award and was honored by the 
Montgomery County Women's Center for her contribution to the Protection from Abuse 
Courtroom Orientation Tutorial. On October 16, 2017, Judge Wall was also honored by the 
Domestic Violence Legal Network in recognition for her fight against domestic violence. 
In December of 2018, Judge Wall was selected to receive the Woman of Distinction Award 
2018 from the Montgomery County Foundation.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
