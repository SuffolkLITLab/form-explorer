MEMORANDUM BY BOWES, J.:  

 

 

     FILED: MARCH 23, 2023 

 

KRG  Kings,  LLC  (“Tenant”)  appeals  from  the  April  18,  2022  order 

denying  Tenant’s  petition  to  open  a  confessed  judgment  arising  from  a 

commercial ground lease between the parties and declining to issue a rule to 

show cause.  We reverse and remand for further proceedings. 

 

On  September  15,  1995,  King’s  Family  Restaurant  (“King’s”)  entered 

into a  twenty-year commercial  ground  lease (“the lease”)  with  Sierra North 

Associates  Limited  PA  (“Landlord”),  the  owner  of  certain  unimproved  real 

estate  located  in  Allegheny  Township,  Blair  County,  Pennsylvania  (“the 

premises”),  for  King’s  to  construct  thereon  a  building  and  outside 

improvements for use as a restaurant.  The lease included additional five-year 

and four-year options, and provided for the following graduated rent schedule:

ee Ground Lease, 9/15/95, at ¶ 8.   On April 1, 2015, King’s assigned  the 

lease to Tenant, with an effective date of April 3, 2015. 

 

In  August  2020,  Landlord  initiated  confessed  judgment  proceedings 

against  Tenant  (“the  2020  proceedings”).    The  filings  related  to  the  2020 

proceedings  are  not  included  in  the  certified  record,  but  it  appears  that 

Landlord  terminated  the  lease  shortly  before  commencing  the  2020 

proceedings because Tenant had failed to timely pay rent during the COVID-

19  pandemic.    Tenant  filed  a  petition  to  open/strike,  which  the  trial  court 

denied,  and  Tenant  appealed  to  this  Court.    In  exchange  for  Tenant 

withdrawing  its appeal and Landlord  discontinuing  the underlying confessed 

judgment  action,  the  parties  executed  an  amendment  of  the  lease  (“the 

amendment”).1  See First Amendment to Lease Agreement, 4/16/21.

The amendment, which was set to commence retroactively to April 1, 

2021,  and  run  until  December  31,  2022,  addressed  Tenant’s  outstanding 

obligations dating back to July 2020.  Of relevance to the instant appeal, ¶ 3 

of the lease was amended to provide that, as additional consideration for the 

amendment, Tenant was required by April 16, 2021, to pay Landlord a lump 

sum of $37,545.00, and Landlord’s attorney a lump sum of $10,000.00.   

Regarding rent payments, ¶ 8 from the lease, which set forth the lease’s 

rent schedule, was revised to read as follows: 

8.  Minimum  monthly  rent  shall  be  $12,814.00  payable  on  or 
before the first of each consecutive month, commencing on May 
1,  2021  and  continuing  to  and  including  the  October  1,  2021 
payment, and commencing with the November 1, 2021 payment, 
the monthly minimum rent shall be $6,250.00 for the balance of 
the term.  The rent due April 1, 2021 is included in the payment 
by  Tenant  under  Paragraph  3.    Late  fees  shall  continue  to  be 
calculated in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

withdrawing the underlying confessed judgment action, the parties  included

d. at 1-2. 

  I

In  December  2021,  after  Tenant  failed  to  pay  the  monthly  rent  for 

October,  November,  and  December  2021,  as  well  as  the  2021-2022  school 

real estate tax, Landlord terminated the amended lease and demanded that 

Tenant vacate the premises.  Tenant did not vacate the premises.  Therefore, 

on December 17, 2021, Landlord filed the underlying petition for confession 

of judgment for money and possession, seeking ejectment and judgment in 

favor  of  Landlord  and  against  Tenant  in  the  amount  of  $45,918.13  for  the 

missed rent payments, school taxes, late fees, and attorney fees.  

On  March  3,  2022,  Tenant  filed  a  petition  to  open  the  confessed 

judgment and stay execution.  Tenant asserted a meritorious defense that it 

was  not  in  default  at  the  time  Landlord  filed  the  underlying  petition  for 

confessed judgment because it had overpaid Landlord.  First, as supported by 

attached emails, Tenant averred that the amendment’s $37,545.00 lump-sum 

payment to Landlord comprised reimbursement for the 2020 real estate taxes 

($19,996.00),  2021  Blair  County/Allegheny  Township  taxes  ($5,911.00), 

common area maintenance fees ($5,074), and the April 2021 holdover rent

J-A02019-23 

2-3.      

payment ($6,564.00).  See Petition to Open, 3/3/22, Exhibit 4 at unnumbered 

Second, Tenant relied on the same email communications to explain the 

reason for the amendment’s two-tiered rent schedule.  To wit, Tenant claimed 

that the amendment provided for new, increased monthly rent payments of 

$6,250.00  beginning  May  1,  2021.    In  addition,  Tenant  was  to  pay  the 

outstanding rent for July 20, 2020 through March 31, 2021 ($39,384.04), in 

six equal payments of $6,654.00 for each of the first six months of the new 

rent schedule.  Thus, according to Tenant, the rent payable for the first six 

months under the amendment was a total of $12,814.00 per month.  See id. 

at Exhibit 4 unnumbered 2.   

Notwithstanding this agreement, Tenant remitted to Landlord five rent 

checks pursuant to the lease’s rent schedule, i.e., $4,713.92, between August 

2020 and March 2021, before remitting in May 2021 a rent check pursuant to 

the amendment’s new rent schedule, i.e., $12,814.01.  See id. at Exhibit 5.  

During  that  same  period,  Tenant  also  remitted  to  Landlord  a  check  for 

$28,283.52  in  August  2020,  and  a  check  for  $14,141.76  in  March  2021, 

though the reason for these disbursements is unclear.  See id.  Based upon 

the foregoing, Tenant attached an accounting spreadsheet and argued to the 

trial court that at the time it supposedly was in default for failing to make a 

payment, it had in fact overpaid Landlord because it had remitted payments 

both under the lease’s rent schedule and pursuant to the amendment’s rent 

- 5 - 

J-A02019-23 

schedule for the same period.  See id. at 5, 7 (arguing that “because [Tenant] 

remitted payments intended to satisfy [Landlord’s] rent claims for July 2020 

to April 2021 that had already been paid in full as of March 2021, [Tenant] 

had a credit in its favor under the [l]ease as of October 2021”).     

Landlord filed a motion to dismiss and an answer, contesting Tenant’s 

assertion that it was not in default and had overpaid.  Landlord attached its 

own  accounting  sheet,  along  with  additional  correspondence  regarding  the 

October,  November,  and  December  2021  missed  payments.    Additionally, 

Landlord increased its monetary damages claim to $141,544.73.  See Motion 

to Dismiss, 3/21/22, at 4.  In response, Tenant filed a memorandum in support 

of issuance of a rule to show cause regarding its petition to open the confessed 

judgment.2    

On  April  18,  2022,  the  trial  court  denied  Tenant’s  petition  to  open 

judgment and declined to issue a rule to show cause.  The court  found that 

Tenant had not met its prima facie burden to establish a viable defense.  In 

short, it discredited Tenant’s argument that it had overpaid and not defaulted 

“[g]iven [Tenant’s] history of defaulting on rent with [Landlord]” in the 2020 

proceedings.  See Order, 4/18/22, at 2.  The trial court entered judgment in 

the amount of $141,544.73 and, upon Landlord’s filing of a writ of execution,

directed the sheriff to remove Tenant from the premises.  Thereafter, Landlord 

filed praecipes for writs of execution for money and possession.  Tenant filed 

a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied.  

Tenant timely filed an appeal to this Court.  Tenant and the trial court 

have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.3  Tenant presents the following issues for 

our consideration: 

I.  Whether the trial court erred in refusing to issue a rule to 
show  cause  and  stay  of  proceedings  in  accordance  with 
Pa.R.Civ.P. 2959(b) because the Petition to Open Judgment 
filed by [Tenant] stated prima facie grounds for relief. 
 

II.  Whether the trial court erred in finding that [Tenant] was in 
default under the terms and conditions of the parties’ Lease 
Agreement at the time judgment by confession was entered 
in favor of [Landlord] because [Landlord] failed to properly 
credit all payments made by [Tenant4]. 

III.  Whether the trial court erred in increasing the amount of the 
money judgment by confession originally entered in favor of 
[Landlord] on December 7, 2021 to include additional rent 
that  accrued  after  judgment  by  confession  for  possession 
was  entered  and/or  without  a  motion  by  [Landlord]  to 
reassess damages. 

enant’s brief at 4.  

We review the denial of a petition to open a confessed judgment for an 

abuse of discretion or error of law.  Ferrick v. Bianchini, 69 A.3d 642, 647 

____________________________________________ 

3  In  lieu  of  a  Rule  1925(a)  opinion,  the  trial  court  relied  on  the  reasoning 
proffered within its two-page April 18, 2022 order. 

 In its statement of questions, Tenant referred to “Appellee” here.  However, 
in context, we believe that Tenant meant to refer to payments that had been 
made by Tenant and have made the appropriate correction.

(Pa.Super. 2013).  Tenant first argues that the trial court erred in not issuing 

a  rule  to  show  cause  and  stay  of  proceedings  in  accordance  with  Pa.R.C.P. 

2959(b).  See Tenant’s brief at 10.  Rule 2959(b) provides as follows: 

If the petition states prima facie grounds for relief the court shall 
issue a rule to show cause and may grant a stay of proceedings.  
After being served with a copy of the petition the plaintiff shall file 
an answer on or before the return day of the rule.  The return day 
of the rule shall be fixed by the court by local rule or special order. 
 

Pa.R.C.P. 2959(b).  The issuance of a rule to show cause is mandatory when 

the  petitioner  has  satisfied  this  prima  facie  requirement.    See  Ohio  Pure 

Foods,  Inc.  v.  Barbe,  697  A.2d  252,  253  (Pa.  1997).    Such  issuance  “is 

merely the first step in the process which culminates in the disposition of the 

rule, i.e., a determination of whether the judgment should be opened.”  Id.   

Disposition of the rule to show cause is then governed by Rule 2959(e), 

which states that 

[t]he court shall dispose of the rule on petition and answer, and 
on  any  testimony,  depositions,  admissions  and  other  evidence.  
The court for cause shown may stay proceedings on the petition 
insofar  as  it  seeks  to  open  the  judgment  pending  disposition  of 
the application to strike off the judgment.  If evidence is produced 
which in a jury trial would require the issues to be submitted to 
the jury the court shall open the judgment. 
 

Pa.R.C.P. 2959(e).  This Court has explained that “[a] judgment by confession 

will be opened if the petitioner acts promptly, alleges a meritorious defense, 

and  presents  sufficient  evidence  in  support  of  the  defense  to  require  the 

submission of the issues to a jury.”  Ferrick, supra at 647 (citation omitted).  

“A meritorious defense is one upon which relief could be afforded if proven at 

- 8 - 

J-A02019-23 

trial.”  Id. (citation omitted, emphasis added).  A petitioner need not prove 

that he would prevail if the judgment was opened.  See Neducsin v. Caplan, 

121  A.3d  498,  506  (Pa.Super.  2015).    In  adjudicating  a  petition  to  open 

judgment,  the  trial  court  must  consider  the  evidence  in  the  light  most 

favorable to the moving party, including all reasonable inferences, and reject 

any contrary evidence from the non-moving party.  Id. 

Tenant argues that the first question before the trial court upon filing of 

the  petition  was  whether  Tenant  had  “stated  prima  facie  grounds  for  relief 

such that a rule to show cause was mandated.”  Tenant’s brief at 13.  Tenant 

avers that it satisfied this preliminary burden and therefore “was entitled to 

present further evidence in support of the [p]etition and to test the allegations 

raised by [Landlord] in its [a]nswer.”  Id.  We agree. 

The trial court offered the following explanation for finding that Tenant 

had  not  satisfied  its  prima  facie  burden  or  presented  a  meritorious  defense 

that would warrant opening the confessed judgment:5 

In  [the  2020  proceedings],  this  Court  previously  ruled  on  a 
petition to open judgment of confession between these same two 
parties due to several defaults in payment of rent.  [In the 2020 
proceedings], we found that [Tenant] had defaulted in its payment 
of rent, and we declined to open the judgment then as well.  Given 
[Tenant’s] history of defaulting on rent with this landlord, we find 
the argument that not only were they not in default, but that they 
actually overpaid rent in this instance to be inaccurate. 
 

____________________________________________ 

5 We note that Landlord’s challenge to the petition to open and the trial court’s 
denial focus on  the merits of Tenant’s  alleged  defense.  There has been no 
challenge to the timeliness of the petition to open.   

- 9 - 

J-A02019-23 

Order, 4/18/22, at 1-2.   

Not only are the court’s findings from the 2020 proceeding not germane 

to the question of whether Tenant had presented a meritorious defense to the 

instant confessed judgment proceedings, the 2020 proceedings were not even 

part  of  the  record  before  the  trial  court  at  the  time  it  rendered  the  above 

holding.    Indeed,  by  virtue  of  the  amendment’s  release,  any  violation  that 

occurred  as  part  of  the  2020  proceedings  was  legally  defunct.    Thus,  upon 

review,  we  conclude  that  in  adjudicating  Tenant’s  petition  to  open  the 

confessed  judgment,  the  trial  court  impermissibly  relied  on  the  2020 

proceedings.6  Moreover, the court failed to view the evidence in the light most 

favorable to Tenant as the moving party and instead improperly credited the 

contrary  evidence  submitted  by  Landlord,  the  non-moving  party.    See 

Tenant’s reply brief at 5 (observing that the trial court “discounted [Tenant’s] 

factual  assertions  in  favor  of  [Landlord]”);  see  also  Landlord’s  brief  at  21 

(noting that “after a review of the competing calculations offered by [Tenant] 

and  [Landlord],  the  trial  court  exercised  its  discretion  in  determining  that 

[Tenant] had defaulted under the lease”).   

Landlord counters that the trial court was permitted to credit Landlord’s 

averments over Tenant’s because Tenant had not presented a factual dispute 

____________________________________________ 

6 As noted, it appears that the 2020 proceedings concerned Tenant’s alleged 
late  payments  in  the  context  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.    No  such  defense 
has been raised in support of Tenant’s petition to open the instant confessed 
judgment.  

- 10 - 

J-A02019-23 

but  had  instead  raised  a  legal  question  that  could  be  determined  by 

“interpretation  of  the  agreement,  as  amended,  and  the  application  of  the 

payments made by [Tenant], and the resulting amount due.”  Landlord’s brief 

at  19-20  (capitalization  altered).    Id.  at  21.    This  argument,  like  the  trial 

court’s analysis, disregards the threshold question before the trial court, which 

was  merely  whether  Tenant  had  stated  prima  facie  grounds  for  relief,  and 

instead  focuses  upon  the  merits  of  Tenant’s  claim  and  whether  Tenant  was 

entitled to an opening of the confessed judgment.   Based on the foregoing, 

we conclude that the trial court palpably abused its discretion in bypassing its 

mandate to issue a rule to show cause once Tenant stated prima facie grounds 

for  relief  and  prematurely  denying  the  petition  to  open  the  confessed 

judgment based upon inappropriately viewing the evidence in the light most 

favorable to the non-moving party. 

Since Tenant satisfied its burden of setting forth prima facie grounds for 

relief and was therefore entitled to the issuance of a rule to show cause, we 

reverse  the  trial  court’s  April  18,  2022  order  and  remand  for  proceedings 

consistent with this memorandum.  In light of our disposition, we do not reach 

Tenant’s remaining claims on appeal. 

Order reversed.  Case remanded.  Jurisdiction relinquished.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
