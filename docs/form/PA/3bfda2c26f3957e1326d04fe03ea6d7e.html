W.M.C. (Mother) appeals from the decrees entered on August 25, 2022, 

that  granted  the  petitions  filed  by  the  Blair  County  Children,  Youth  and 

Families (CYF or  Agency) to involuntarily terminate Mother’s parental rights

appeal.2   

stating:   

(collectively  Children).1    Following  our  review,  we  affirm  the  decrees  on 

 

In its opinion, the trial court provided a procedural overview of the case, 

The  above  [C]hildren  were  subject 

 
to  dependency 
proceedings in the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas 
of Blair County.  During the dependency proceedings, this [c]ourt 
entered  Orders  regarding  both  [C]hildren  on  November  19, 
2021[,]  changing  the  goals  to  adoption.    Those  Orders  outlined 
the  [c]ourt’s  factual  reasoning  for  the  goal  of  adoption.  
Subsequent[]  to  the  entry  of  these  Orders,  the  Agency  filed 
petitions  to  terminate  the  parental  rights  of  the  parents  of  the 
subject  [C]hildren.    These  petitions  were  filed  against  the 
biological  [M]other  and  biological  [F]ather  on  March  17,  2022.  
Hearings  occurred  on  the  Agency’s  Petitions  for  Termination  of 
Parental  Rights  on  July  7,  2022[,]  and  August  18,  2022.    This 
[c]ourt entered Final Decrees regarding both subject [C]hildren on 
August  24,  2022[,]  granting  the  Agency’s  Petition[s]  for 
Termination of Parental Rights.  The Final Decrees contained this 
[c]ourt’s  legal  conclusions  and  also  indicated  that  the  facts  as 
contained in the Petitions for Involuntary Termination of Parental 
Rights  were  true.    …  Neither  parent  filed  a  [timely]  Concise 
Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal as required by the 
Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Therefore, this [c]ourt believes that 
any issues are waived.   

To the extent that the parents’ appeals are not waived, this 
[c]ourt  believes  that  our  Final  Decrees  of  August  24,  2022[,] 
which adopted the facts contained in the Petition for Involuntary 
Termination  of  Parental  Rights  as  well  as  the  factual  basis 
contained  in  our  goal  change  Orders  of  November  19,  2021[,] 
provide  sufficient  factual  and  legal  support  for  the  [c]ourt’s 
decision to grant the Agency’s Petitions for Termination of Parental 

   

1 Although C.A.K.’s (Father) parental rights were also terminated in regard to 
both Children at the same time Mother’s were terminated, Father is not a party 
to this appeal.   

  This  Court  consolidated  Mother’s  two  appeals  sua  sponte  by  order  dated 
December 13, 2022.

Rights.    We  incorporate  our  Final  Decrees  and  Dependency 
Order[s] of November 19, 2021[,] into this Opinion.   

Trial Court’s Opinion (TCO), 11/7/2022, at 1-2.   

The Petitions for Termination of Parental Rights, filed by the Agency on 

March  1,  2022,  outline  the  facts  of  this  matter,  indicating  that  O.J.K.  was 

removed  from  the  parents’  care  on  December  31,  2020,  and  K.W.K.  was 

removed from the parents’ care on July 21, 2021.  With regard to Mother, the 

Petitions,  which  the  trial  court  found  to  be  factually  true,  state  that  Mother 

has  a  history  of  criminal  activity,  illicit  drug  use,  and  a  lack  of  stable  and 

independent  housing.    Although  in  August  of  2021  Mother  was  successfully 

discharged from inpatient drug and alcohol treatment, by October 2021, she 

again tested positive for heroin and fentanyl and refused to re-attend inpatient 

drug  rehabilitation  for  detoxification  and  long-term  treatment.    Mother  also 

did not cooperate with the Agency and with law enforcement in that she failed 

to keep in contact with her probation officer and had outstanding warrants for 

her arrest due to a failure to comply with her supervision conditions.  Mother 

also  stopped  participating  in  reunification  services  with  the  Agency  and 

stopped  exercising  her  four-hours-per-week  visitation  sessions  with  the 

Children.   

 

Following the court’s filing of its decrees terminating Mother’s parental 

rights to the two Children on August 25, 2022, Mother filed a pro se appeal to 

this  Court  on  September  23,  2022.    However,  she  did  not  file  a  concise 

statement  of  errors  complained  of  on  appeal  concurrently  with  her  appeal.  

Rather, her attorney filed a statement on her behalf on September 28, 2022.  

- 3 - 

J-S05001-23 

Thus, we must first determine whether Mother has waived her issues as the 

trial court suggests.  We rely on this Court’s reasoning in the case of J.P. v. 

S.P., 991 A.2d 904, 907 (Pa. Super. 2010), wherein a mother “failed to file a 

concise  statement  of  errors  complained  of  on  appeal  concurrently  with  her 

notice  of  appeal[,]”  which  is  required  by  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(a)(2)(i).    The  J.P. 

opinion explains:   

In  In  re  K.T.E.L.,  983  A.2d  745  (Pa.  Super.  2009),  this 
Court addressed a similar issue and declined to extend the bright-
line waiver rule the Supreme Court adopted in Commonwealth 
v. Castillo, 585 Pa. 395, 888 A.2d 775 (Pa. 2005), to deem the 
appellant’s issues waived in a children’s fast track case for failing 
to comply with the amended rule strictly.  Specifically, we held,  

he  failure  of  an  appellant  in  a  children’s  fast  track 
case  to  file  contemporaneously  a  concise  statement 
with the notice of appeal pursuant to rules 905(a)(2) 
and  1925(a)(2),  will  result  in  a  defective  notice  of 
appeal.    The  disposition  of  the  defective  notice  of 
appeal  will  then  be  decided  on  a  case  by  case  basis 
under the guidelines set forth in Stout v. Universal 
Underwriters Ins. Co., 491 Pa. 601, 421 A.2d 1047, 
1049 (Pa. 1980). 
 

  t

K.T.E.L.,  983  A.2d  at  747.    In  reaching  this  decision,  we 
distinguished  between  a  court-ordered  Rule  1925(b)  statement 
and one mandated by a procedural rule.  Essentially, we reasoned 
that by failing to file the Rule 1925(b) statement concurrently with 
the notice of appeal, the appellant violated our rules of appellate 
procedure and not a trial court order as in Castillo.  Id. at 747 
n.1.    Accordingly,  we  concluded  that  a  bright-line  application  of 
the waiver rule was not warranted in that case for violating the 
procedure outlined in Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(i).   
 

Herein,  [the  m]other  failed  to  file  the  Rule  1925(b) 
statement concurrent with her notice of appeal.  However, mindful 
of our holding in K.T.E.L., we decline to find [the m]other’s issues 
waived  merely  for  violating  the  procedural  rules  outlined  in 
Pa.R.A.P.  1925(a)(2)(i).    Nevertheless,  as  noted  supra,  [the 

- 4 - 

J-S05001-23 

m]other  not  only  failed  to  comply  with  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(a)(2)(i), 
but she also failed to comply with the trial court’s order to file a 
Rule 1925(b) statement within twenty-one days of the date of the 
order.  Unlike the reasoning underlying our rationale in K.T.E.L., 
relating to violations of procedural rules, an appellant’s failure to 
comply with an order to file a Rule 1925(b) statement in a timely 
manner constitutes waiver of all objections to the order, ruling, or 
other matter complained of on appeal.  See Commonwealth v. 
Lord,  553  Pa.  415,  719  A.2d  306  (Pa.  1998);  Castillo,  supra.  
This waiver rule applies to family law cases.  In re L.M., 923 A.2d 
505, 509 (Pa. Super. 2007). 

 

J. P., 991 A.2d at 907-08 (emphasis in original).  Accordingly, in accordance 

with  J.P.,  we  conclude  in  the  present  matter  that  Mother’s  issues  were  not 

waived in that she only violated the pertinent procedural rule but did not fail 

to  comply  with  a  court  order.    Thus,  we  proceed  with  a  review  of  Mother’s 

issues now before our Court. 

 

Mother listed the following in her brief:   

I.   Whether  the  court  erred  in  terminating  [Mother’s] 
parental  rights  where  she  had  previously  made  great 
strides towards reunification, and was successful in her 
efforts for a substantial period of time.   
 

II. Whether  the  court  erred  in  terminating  [Mother’s] 
parental rights prior to determining the outcome of her 
criminal charges for which she was incarcerated.   
 

Mother’s brief at 4.   

following standard: 

We review an order terminating parental rights in accordance with the 

 
When  reviewing  an  appeal  from  a  decree  terminating 
parental  rights,  we  are  limited  to  determining  whether  the 
decision  of  the  trial  court  is  supported  by  competent  evidence.  
Absent  an  abuse  of  discretion,  an  error  of  law,  or  insufficient 
evidentiary support for the trial court’s decision, the decree must 

- 5 - 

J-S05001-23 

stand.  Where a trial court has granted a petition to involuntarily 
terminate  parental  rights,  this  Court  must  accord  the  hearing 
judge’s decision the same deference that we would give to a jury 
verdict.  We must employ a broad, comprehensive review of the 
record in order to determine whether the trial court’s decision is 
supported by competent evidence. 

In re R.N.J., 985 A.2d 273, 276 (Pa. Super. 2009) (quoting In re S.H., 879 

A.2d 802, 805 (Pa. Super. 2005)).  Moreover, we have explained that: 

The  standard  of  clear  and  convincing  evidence  is  defined  as 
testimony that is so “clear, direct, weighty and convincing as to 
enable  the  trier  of  fact  to  come  to  a  clear  conviction,  without 
hesitance, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.”   
 

Id. (quoting In re J.L.C. & J.R.C., 837 A.2d 1247, 1251 (Pa. Super. 2003)).  

The trial court is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence presented 

and is likewise free to make all credibility determinations and resolve conflicts 

in  the  evidence.    In  re  M.G.,  855  A.2d  68,  73-74  (Pa.  Super.  2004).    If 

competent evidence supports the trial court’s findings, we will affirm even if 

the record could also support the opposite result.  In re Adoption of T.B.B., 

835 A.2d 387, 394 (Pa. Super. 2003).   

 

We are guided further by the following:  Termination of parental rights 

is governed by Section 2511 of the Adoption Act, which requires a bifurcated 

analysis.  

Our case law has made clear that under Section 2511, the court 
must engage in a bifurcated process prior to terminating parental 
rights.  Initially, the focus is on the conduct of the parent.  The 
party  seeking  termination  must  prove  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence that the parent’s conduct satisfies the statutory grounds 
for termination delineated in Section 2511(a).  Only if the court 
determines that the parent’s conduct warrants termination of his 
or her parental rights does the court engage in the second part of 

- 6 - 

J-S05001-23 

the  analysis  pursuant  to  Section  2511(b):  determination  of  the 
needs and welfare of the child under the standard of best interests 
of the child.  One major aspect of the needs and welfare analysis 
concerns  the  nature  and  status  of  the  emotional  bond  between 
parent and child, with close attention paid to the effect on the child 
of permanently severing any such bond.   
 

In re L.M., 923 A.2d 505, 511 (Pa. Super. 2007) (citing 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511, 

other citations omitted).  The burden is upon the petitioner to prove by clear 

and convincing evidence that the asserted grounds for seeking the termination 

of parental rights are valid.  R.N.J., 985 A.2d at 276.   

 

The  trial  court’s  decrees  terminated  Mother’s  parental  rights  pursuant 

to section 2511(a)(2), (5) and (b).  We need only agree with the trial court as 

to any one subsection of section 2511(a), as well as section 2511(b), in order 

to  affirm.    In  re  B.L.W.,  843  A.2d  380,  284  (Pa.  Super.  2004)  (en  banc).  

Here, we analyze the court’s decision to terminate under sections 2511(a)(2), 

which provides:   

(a) General rule.--The rights of a parent in regard to a child may 
be  terminated  after  a  petition  filed  on  any  of  the  following 
grounds: 
 

 

*** 

(2)  The  repeated  and  continued  incapacity,  abuse, 
neglect or refusal of the parent has caused the child 
to  be  without  essential  parental  care,  control  or 
subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-
being and the conditions and causes of the incapacity, 
abuse,  neglect  or  refusal  cannot  or  will  not  be 
remedied by the parent. 
 

- 7 - 

23  Pa.C.S.  §  2511(a)(2).    To  address  whether  the  trial  court  abused  its 

discretion  by  terminating  Mother’s  parental  rights  pursuant  to  section 

2511(a)(2), we are further guided by the following:   

In order to terminate parental rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.[] § 
2511(a)(2),  the  following  three  elements  must  be  met:  (1) 
repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal; (2) 
such incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal has caused the child to 
be  without  essential  parental  care,  control  or  subsistence 
necessary  for  his  physical  or  mental  well-being;  and  (3)  the 
causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal cannot or will 
not be remedied.  

n re Adoption of M.E.P., 825 A.2d 1266, 1272 (Pa. Super. 2003) (citation 

  I

omitted).  “The grounds for termination due to parental incapacity that cannot 

be remedied are not limited to affirmative misconduct.  To the contrary, those 

grounds may include acts of refusal as well as incapacity to perform parental 

duties.”    In  re  A.L.D.,  797  A.2d  326,  337  (Pa.  Super.  2002)  (citations 

omitted).  

 

With  regard  to  Mother’s  first  issue,  she  contends  that  the  evidence 

supporting the termination of her parental rights was not clear and convincing.  

Specifically,  Mother  asserts that “[s]he attended visits and focused on drug 

rehabilitation efforts, attending multiple rehab programs, including inpatient, 

in [an] attempt to stay sober for her [C]hildren.”  Mother’s brief at 7.  Mother 

noted that the care of K.W.K. by her mother, who was using illicit substances, 

resulted in the child’s removal.  At that time, Mother claims that she herself 

was  making  strides  in  improving  conditions  that  had  led  to  the  finding  of 

dependency.  However, despite this argument, Mother then acknowledges that 

- 8 - 

J-S05001-23 

J-S05001-23 

since  July  of  2021,  she  “severed  contact  with  the  Agency  and  discontinued 

services, which ultimately led to the Agency[’s] seeking termination of [her] 

parental rights.”  Id.  Then, Mother asserts that, at the termination hearing, 

she argued that “if  given the opportunity, she would continue  with  services 

and remedy the conditions noted by the Agency.”  Id.  Essentially, Mother is 

claiming that her earlier efforts should be given substantial weight.3   

 

Having reviewed the record, we conclude that it supports the findings of 

the  trial  court  that  Mother  has  not  provided  Children  with  the  essential 

parental care, control and subsistence necessary for their mental and physical 

well-being. 

  While  the  trial  court  noted  Mother’s  earlier,  positive 

accomplishments, it is clear that Mother will not, or cannot, become a capable 

parent for Children at any point in the foreseeable future.  Thus, we conclude 

that the court’s determination that the Agency carried its burden of proving 

the  statutory  grounds  for  termination  under  subsection  2511(a)(2)  is 

supported by the evidence.  Therefore, Mother is not entitled to relief.   

 

In her second issue, Mother argues that little weight should have been 

given  to  her  incarcerated  status  by  the  trial  court,  because  “very  little  was 

known  about  what  would  transpire  with  regard  to  [Mother’s]  criminal 

circumstances.”    Mother’s  brief  at  8.    Mother  also  contends  that  if  she  had 

been granted reconsideration and admitted into the court’s drug program, her 

____________________________________________ 

3 Mother does not include any argument directed at subsection 2511(b).   

- 9 - 

J-S05001-23 

“criminal circumstances could have been remedied within a reasonable period 

of time.”  Id.  Mother overlooks the fact that her unresolved drug use in the 

past two years has been chronic and that even if she is not incarcerated for 

an extensive period of time, she will be required to re-establish her ability to 

provide safety and stability for the Children.  A child’s life cannot be put on 

hold  in  the  hope  that  the  parent  will  summon  the  ability  to  handle  the 

responsibilities of parenting.  In re C.L.G., 956 A.2d 999 (Pa. Super. 2008) 

(citing In re Z.S.W., 946 A.2d 726, 732 (Pa. Super. 2008)).  Moreover, “[t]he 

trial court, as the finder of fact, is entitled to weigh the evidence and assess 

its credibility.”  Id.  It is evident that the trial court here determined that the 

Children should not be subjected to an extended period without permanency.  

Mother has not convinced this Court otherwise.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
