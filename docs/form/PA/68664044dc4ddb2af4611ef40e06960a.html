In Re:  43rd Judicial District 
 

38 MM 2020 
 
Petition for Emergency Judicial Order 
Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2) 

 

Petition for Continuation of Emergency Judicial Order Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 
1952(B)(2) 
 

TO THE JUSTICES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT: 

Margherita Patti-Worthington, President Judge of the 43rd Judicial District, 

hereby files the following Petition for Emergency Judicial Order Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 

No. 1952(B)(2) and in support thereof, avers as follows: 

1. 

On March 16, 2020, we declared a judicial emergency in response to the 

COVID-19 Pandemic. 

30, 2021. 

2. 

By subsequent orders, we extended the judicial emergency through June 

3. 

On June 21, 2021, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court entered an order 

stating “[e]ffective July 6, 2021, operation of the Unified Judicial System shall return to 

pre-pandemic status. All courtrooms, adjacent judicial facilities, chambers, and offices 

within the Unified Judicial System shall be fully opened and staffed by judges and other 

4. 

On June 24, 2021, in response to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s June 

21st Order, we filed a “Petition for Emergency Judicial Order Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 

1952(B)(2),” which was granted, in part, by Order of the Supreme Court dated June 29, 

personnel.” 

2021. 

5. 

Every month since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s June 21st Order, we 

have filed Petitions for the continued use of advanced communication technology (ACT) 

 

in court proceedings. Every month, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has granted our 

Petitions, in part, and has authorized the President Judge to suspend state or local rules 

that restrict the use of ACT in court proceedings, subject to state and federal 

constitutional limitations. The Orders further require that Judges shall be present in the 

courthouse, judicial center, or other court facility whenever a proceeding is being 

conducted by ACT, except for extraordinary circumstances, such as when court 

properties have been closed due to inclement weather or other emergency under 

Pa.R.J.A. No. 1950-1954, or when a proceeding is not being conducted during normal 

business hours.   

6. 

For the following reasons, we again request that the Pennsylvania 

Supreme Court grant permission for this Court to continue to suspend any state or local 

rule that restricts the use of advanced communication technology (ACT) in court 

proceedings, through April 30, 2021 as a proactive, preventative and necessary 

measure and in support thereof avers: 

a. 

The full vaccination rate in the 43rd Judicial District remains under the 

average for all of Pennsylvania and our daily case count continues to 

be high and continue rising, with a current daily average of 107 new 

cases. This daily case count matches the County’s statistics from our 

largest spike in cases to date: December 2020. Additionally, earlier this 

month, we surpassed our highest 2020 case numbers with an average 

daily case count of 134. 

b. 

Over the month of December, Monroe County’s ICU utilization rate is 

currently 83%, which is considered “high.” However, over the month of 

December, ICU utilization did spike to “critical” levels (90%) and likely 

only decreased due to transfers to ICUs in other jurisdictions as our 

average daily number of COVID hospitalization has increased by 

 

10.5% over the last seven days. 

c. 

The County’s current COVID-19 incident rate per 100,000 is 474.0, 

with a percent positivity rate of 20%. These numbers are on par with 

what Monroe County was experiencing at the height of the pandemic in 

December of 2020. Moreover, our incident rate per 100,000 has 

increased 60% since our last petition filed on November 30, 2021. 

d. 

Currently, Monroe County’s daily new cases per 100,000 is more than 

double that of Philadelphia County and nearly double that of other 

larger jurisdictions including, Chester, Montgomery, Bucks and 

Delaware Counties. Notably, all of these larger jurisdictions also have 

significantly higher vaccination rates than Monroe County. 

e. 

The statewide statistics likewise remain troublesome as 

Pennsylvania’s daily case average is 7,649.  

f. 

Moreover, as the newest variant, Omicron, makes its way through the 

U.S., with confirmed cases in the areas surrounding Monroe County, 

we must remain vigilant in our efforts to maintain social distancing and 

other countermeasures. Indeed, while the trajectory of this variant is 

still unclear, preliminary research indicates, and our current statistics 

appear to support, that the Omicron variant is more transmissible and 

replicates more quickly than either of its predecessors. 

g. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or what we might be facing in the near 

future, all courts in the 43rd Judicial District have been and have 

remained open since our declaration of judicial emergency with health 

and safety measures in place that have enabled us to avoid any major 

outbreaks of COVID-19 among court and court-related employees and 

staff.  

 

h. 

Unfortunately, over the month of December, we have seen recent 

outbreaks of COVID-19 in three separate court-related Departments 

housed within the Courthouse. At least one of the outbreaks has led to 

employee hospitalization and yet another to employee ICU 

hospitalization. Thanks in large part to our current protocols, which 

include the invaluable use of ACT, we have been able to contain 

further spread within the Courthouse. 

i. 

We have been able to remain consistently open and operational by 

using both ACT and in-person proceedings at our Magisterial District 

Justice offices and the Court of Common Pleas. ACT has been vital in 

our ability to remain open. This is especially true in light of two recent 

COVID-19 outbreaks: one in our Sheriff’s Office, reducing the number 

of deputies available for in-court proceedings, and one in the Public 

Defender’s Office, which reduced the number of defense attorneys 

available for in-court proceedings.  

j. 

The continued use of ACT in Preliminary Hearings, Preliminary and 

Formal Arraignments, Pretrial Conferences, Guilty Plea Hearings,  

Bench Warrant Hearings, Sentencing Hearings, Post Sentence 

Motions Hearings, Bail Hearings, and PCRA Hearings is necessary 

while COVID-19 transmission rates remain high in Monroe County. 

The availability of ACT as an alternative to conducting in-person 

proceedings in the above matters allows this Court to limit the number 

of people in the Courthouse, overall, and the courtrooms, individually, 

to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and increase the availability of 

lawyers to handle multiple matters across multiple courtrooms or 

counties. ACT also allows this Court to continue conducting these 

 

types of proceedings with individuals incarcerated at state correctional 

facilities, to further cut down on transportation-related exposure. All 

judges and staff have been and will continue to preside in the 

courtroom and Court Facilities.  

k. 

Since March 12, 2020, we have had 9,566 criminal dispositions, 

including 122 total trial dispositions, 45 of which were jury trials and 30 

were bench trials. We continue to work consistently to reduce the 

backlog of cases that resulted from the initial state-wide shut down of 

Court Facilities and have nearly accomplished this monumental task.  

l. 

We have been able to maintain these numbers, despite space 

limitations, through the use of ACT. In our Courthouse, we are limited, 

based on safe social distancing standards, to selecting only one jury at 

a time in our largest courtroom, as opposed to multiple juries in 

multiple courtrooms. Additionally, throughout the course of a jury trial, 

we must internally simulcast the proceedings to another location in 

order to maintain proper public access, in addition to safe social 

distancing. Furthermore, we have been conducting all bench trials via 

ACT in an effort to free Courtroom space for jury trials to keep cases 

moving through the system in a fair and efficient manner. 

m. 

Nearly every Custody petition filed in this Court requires either a 

hearing or a conciliation conference. Custody filings in Monroe County 

remain steady and the accompanying hearings and conciliations are 

conducted utilizing ACT, with at least 24 ACT custody proceedings 

being scheduled every week. Without the use of ACT, we would be 

entirely unable to process our current Custody caseload. As explained 

above, Court Facility space that can be effectively used with proper 

 

social distancing is at a premium and must be used for jury trials where 

possible. By being able to conduct Custody hearings and conciliations 

via ACT, we do not have to divert precious Court Facility space, we 

can protect the litigants, including children who are not yet eligible for 

vaccination, and Court officers involved, and we can keep up with our 

Custody caseload without compromising on space, safety, or 

efficiency. 

n. 

The use of ACT has been favorably received by our justice partners in 

that it has proven efficient and effective in allowing the courts of the 

Forty-Third Judicial District to move matters through the system. The 

continued use of ACT will allow for further prompt resolution of cases.  

o. 

The vaccination rate of our local jail population remains well below the 

statewide average and ACT has proven to increase the safety of 

prisoners while providing a cost-effective alternative to the often-

unnecessary transport of prisoners to and from in-person proceedings. 

p. 

Though Monroe County’s case numbers have been steadily rising 

through the month of December, COVID cases at the jail have been 

surprisingly low. Due to space constraints at the jail, a COVID-19 

outbreak is incredibly difficult to contain when it does occur, as 

statistics from our previous Petitions have shown. However, due in 

large part to this Court’s use of ACT, the jail has been able to 

effectively keep the infection rate under 5% throughout the pandemic.  

q. 

85% or more of preliminary hearings are waived and the Magisterial 

District Justice offices of this Judicial District do not provide enough 

space to effectively implement social distancing precautions. ACT 

proceedings in this Judicial District have and continue to be invaluable 

 

to the health, safety, and welfare of all involved while maintaining the 

ability to move cases through the judicial process. 

r. 

For example, with the use of ACT proceedings for incarcerated 

individuals, we have been able to avoid transporting these individuals 

to MDJ Offices by police vehicles, which are small and confined and 

offer no ability for social distancing, and then back to the jail, where 

there is limited space to effectively quarantine. If this Judicial District 

were forced to abandon our pandemic-related ACT practices, these 

types of exposures could easily spark a more widespread infection at 

the jail. 

s. 

This Court seeks permission to continue using ACT in the manner we 

have been since the beginning of this pandemic pursuant to the 

definition of “emergency” as “an event or events that . . . poses a threat 

to the health and safety of court personnel, court users or the public,” 

Pa. R.J.A. No. 1950, in order to prevent a major outbreak of COVID-19 

at the jail or in any judicial facility, and to continue processing matters 

safely, fairly, and expeditiously. 

WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that in consideration of efficiencies in 

reducing backlog, cost effectiveness, and the health, safety, and welfare of the public, 

court and county employees, and the judges and staff of the 43rd Judicial District, this 

Court provide the following relief: 

1.  Authorize the President Judge of the 43rd Judicial District to continue to 

suspend any state or local rule that restricts, directly or indirectly, the use of 

ACT in court proceedings until April 30, 2021, with the exception of Rule of 

Criminal Procedure 600, to allow the continued use of ACT where at all 

possible and practicable for any and all proceedings within this Judicial 

District. 

 

Respectfully submitted,
