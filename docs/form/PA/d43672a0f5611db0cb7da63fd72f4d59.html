PINION NOT REPORTED 

EMORANDUM OPINION  

BY JUDGE WALLACE  

 

 

 

FILED:  March 22, 2023 

David  Smuck  (Claimant)  petitions  for  review  of the order of  the  Workers’ 

Compensation  Appeal  Board  (Board)  dated  October  5,  2021,  which  affirmed  the 

decision  and  order  of  the  Workers’  Compensation  Judge  (WCJ),  circulated 

December 8, 2020 (WCJ’s Decision).  The WCJ’s Decision granted the Modification 

Petition  filed  by  Dana  Holding  Corporation  (Employer)  and  changed  Claimant’s 

disability status from total to partial based upon a February 13, 2020  Impairment 

Rating Evaluation  (IRE).    Claimant  challenges as unconstitutional the  retroactive 

application  of  Act  111  of  2018  (Act  111),  which  added  Section  306(a.3)  of  the 

    B

  O

  M

 

   

Workers’ Compensation Act (Act).1  Claimant asserts the Board erred in applying 

Act 111 in his case because his work injury occurred before Act 111’s effective date.  

Upon review, we affirm.  

I. Background 

 

Claimant sustained a work-related injury on April 6, 2000.  WCJ Dec. at 3; 

Certified Record (C.R.), Item No. 4.  Employer issued a Notice of Compensation 

Payable  and  began  paying  Claimant  temporary  total  disability  (TTD)  benefits  of 

$449.60 per week.  Id.  On February 13, 2020, Claimant underwent an IRE, which 

demonstrated  a  10% impairment rating based on  the  6th  edition of the American 

Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (6th edition 

AMA  Guides).    Id.    Employer  filed  its  Modification  Petition  on  June  4,  2020, 

requesting Claimant’s disability status be changed from TTD to temporary partial 

disability (TPD) benefits as of the IRE date.  C.R., Item No. 2.   

 

The  WCJ  held  a  hearing  on  Employer’s  Modification  Petition,  wherein 

Claimant raised and preserved a constitutional challenge to Act 111.  Claimant did 

not present any medical evidence to rebut Employer’s IRE nor dispute the findings 

in the IRE.  C.R., Item No. 4.  The WCJ concluded Employer met its burden of proof 

under Act 111 and granted Employer’s Modification Petition, modifying Claimant’s 

benefits from TTD to TPD effective February 13, 2020.  Id.  On October 5, 2021, 

the Board affirmed the WCJ’s Decision.  C.R., Item No. 7.  On November 14, 2021, 

Claimant  filed  his  Petition  for  Review  (Petition)  with  this  Court  appealing  the 

1 Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, added by Act of October 24, 2018, P.L. 714, No. 111, 
77 P.S. § 511.3.   

2 

 

Board’s decision.   

   

II. Issue  

 

Claimant’s sole claim on appeal is that the Board “erred as a matter of law in 

holding  that  Act  111  is  to  be  applied  retroactively  to  cases  wherein  the  cause  of 

action  accrued/work  injury  occurred  prior  to  the  enactment  of  Act  111  .  .  .  .”  

Claimant’s  Br.  at  4.    Claimant  asserts  retroactively  applying  Act  111’s  IRE 

mechanism, effective October 24, 2018, to modify benefits awarded for an April 6, 

2000 injury is unconstitutional.  Id.  Claimant maintains he “had a vested interest in 

the continuation of his TTD benefits until he is found to be ineligible under a valid 

statute.”  Petition ¶ 9.  He argues because “Section 306(a.2) was declared null and 

void by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court it is unenforceable; therefore, the Claimant 

continues  to  have  a  valid,  vested  right  in  his  continuation  of  TTD  workers’ 

compensation benefits.”  Id.  Claimant requests this Court “reverse the Decision and 

Order of the Board dated October 5, 2021, which affirmed the Decision and Order 

of  the  WCJ  circulated  December  8,  2020[,]  which  granted  the  Employer’s 

Modification Petition.”  Id. ¶ 10. 

III.  Discussion  

 

 

Our review in this case is limited to “determining whether the WCJ’s findings 

of  fact  were  supported  by  substantial  evidence,  whether  an  error  of  law  was 

committed,  or  whether  constitutional  rights  were  violated.”    Pierson  v.  Workers’ 

Comp.  Appeal  Bd.  (Consol  Pa.  Coal  Co.  LLC),  252  A.3d  1169,  1172  n.3  (Pa. 

Cmwlth.), appeal denied, 261 A.3d 378 (Pa. 2021).   

In  response  to  our  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Protz  v.  Workers’ 

Compensation Appeal Board (Derry Area School District), 161 A.3d 827 (Pa. 2017), 

in which the Court held the IRE provisions contained in Section 306(a.2) of the Act, 

formerly 77 P.S. § 511.2, violated the nondelegation doctrine of the Pennsylvania 

3 

Constitution, the General Assembly enacted Act 111 on October 14, 2018.  Act 111 

repealed Section 306(a.2) of the Act, formerly 77 P.S. § 511.2, and added Section 

306(a.3) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 511.3, reestablishing the IRE process.   

 

While the IRE process remains substantially the same as it was before, Act 

111 requires a physician use the 6th edition AMA Guides when performing an IRE 

and permits modification to partial disability status if a claimant has a whole-body 

impairment of less than 35%.  Specifically, Act 111, Section 306(a.3) of the Act, 

states:  
 

(1) When an employe has received total disability compensation . . .  for 
a period of one hundred and four weeks, unless otherwise agreed to, the 
employe shall be required to submit to a medical examination which 
shall be requested by the insurer within sixty days . . . to  determine the 
degree of impairment due to the compensable injury, if any. The degree 
of  impairment  shall  be  determined  based  upon  an  evaluation  by  a 
physician who is licensed in this Commonwealth, who is certified by 
an  American  Board  of  Medical  Specialties-approved  board  or  its 
osteopathic equivalent and who is active in clinical practice for at least 
twenty  hours  per  week,  chosen  by  agreement  of  the  parties,  or  as 
designated  by  the  department,  pursuant  to  the  [6th  edition  AMA 
Guides]. 

2) If such determination results in an impairment rating that meets  a 
threshold  impairment  rating  that  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  [35%] 
impairment  under  [6th  edition  AMA  Guides],  the  employe  shall  be 
presumed  to  be  totally  disabled  and  shall  continue  to  receive  total 
disability compensation benefits . . . If such determination results in an 
impairment rating less than  [35%] impairment under the  [6th edition 
AMA Guides], the employe shall then receive partial disability benefits 
. . .  Provided, however,  [t]hat no reduction shall be made until sixty 
days’ notice of modification is given. 

3)  Unless  otherwise  adjudicated  or  agreed  to  based  upon  a 
determination of earning power . . . the amount of compensation shall 
not be affected as a result of the change in disability status and shall 
remain the same. An insurer or employe may, at any time prior to or 

 (

 (

4 

during the five hundred-week period of partial disability, show that the 
employe’s earning power has changed. 

4) An employe may appeal the change to partial disability at any time 
during  the  five  hundred-week  period  of  partial  disability;  Provided, 
That  there  is  a  determination  that  the  employe  meets  the  threshold 
impairment  rating  that  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  [35%]  impairment 
under the [6th edition AMA Guides].  

5) Total disability shall continue until it is adjudicated or agreed . . .  
that total disability has ceased or the employe’s condition improves to 
an impairment rating that is less than [35%] of the degree of impairment 
defined under the [6th edition AMA Guides].   

6)  Upon  request  of  the  insurer,  the  employe  shall  submit  to  an 
independent medical examination in accordance with the provisions of 
section 314 to determine the status of impairment: Provided, however, 
That for purposes of this clause, the employe shall not be required to 
submit to more than two independent medical examinations under this 
clause during a twelve-month period. 

7)  In  no  event  shall  the  total  number  of  weeks  of  partial  disability 
exceed  five  hundred  weeks  for  any  injury  or  recurrence  thereof, 
regardless of the changes in status in disability that may occur. In no 
event  shall  the  total  number  of  weeks  of  total  disability  exceed  one 
hundred and four weeks for any employe who does not meet a threshold 
impairment  rating  that  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  [35%]  impairment 
under the [6th edition AMA Guides].

Section 306(a.3) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 511.3.  Further, Section 3 of Act 111 provides, 

in pertinent part: 

1) For the purposes of determining whether an employee shall submit 
to a  medical examination to determine the degree of impairment and 
whether an employee has received total disability compensation for the 
period of 104 weeks under [S]ection 306(a.3)(1) of the [A]ct, an insurer 
shall  be  given  credit  for  weeks  of  total  disability  compensation  paid 
prior to the effective date of this paragraph. This [S]ection shall not be 
construed to alter the requirements of [S]ection 306(a.3) of the [A]ct. 

(2) For the purposes of determining the total number of weeks of partial 
disability  compensation  payable  under  [S]ection  306(a.3)(7)  of  the 

 

5 

[A]ct, an  insurer  shall  be  given  credit  for  weeks  of  partial  disability 
compensation paid prior to the effective date of this paragraph. 

Claimant asserts Act 111’s application to his case is improperly retroactive 

because  his  work  injury  occurred  before  the  enactment  date  of  Act  111.    A 

One which relates back to and gives a previous transaction a legal effect 
different  from  that  which  it  had  under  the  law  in  effect  when  it 
transpired.  .  .  .  A  law  is  given  retroactive  effect  when  it  is  used  to 
impose new legal burdens on a past transaction or occurrence. 
 

Whitfield v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd. (Tenet Health Sys. Hahnemann LLC), 188 

A.3d 599, 616 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018) (quoting Dep’t of Lab. & Indus., Bureau of Emp. 

Sec. v. Pa. Eng’g Corp., 421 A.2d 521, 523 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1980)).  “[T]he Remedies 

Clause prohibits the enactment of retroactive legislation if the application . . . would 

extinguish a vested right.”  Konidaris v. Portnoff Law Assocs., Ltd, 953 A.2d 1231, 

1235 (Pa. 2008).  “A ‘vested right’ is one that ‘so completely and definitely belongs 

to a person that it cannot be impaired or taken away without the person’s consent.’”  

Pierson, 252 A.3d at 1179 (citation omitted).  In Pierson, we explained that there 

are no vested rights in workers’ compensation benefits as calculated at the time of 

the injury because there are reasonable expectations under the Act that benefits may 

change  over  time.    Id.    Where  there  is  no  vested  right  involved,  an  act  is  not 

retroactive simply because it applies to a condition existing on its effective date.  Id.  

 

This  Court  has  previously  considered  and  rejected  arguments  similar  to 

Claimant’s regarding the retroactive application of Act 111.  In Pierson, 252 A.3d 

1169,  the  claimant  argued  applying  Act  111  to  injuries  occurring  before  its 

ct 111, § 3(1), (2).   

  A

 

retroactive law is:  
 

6 

enactment would impair a claimant’s vested rights.  In rejecting this argument, this 

Court explained:  
      

While [the claimant] argues that he has a right to benefits as calculated 
at the time of injury, there are reasonable expectations under the Act 
that  benefits  may  change.  We  acknowledge  that  a  claimant  retains  a 
certain right to benefits until such time as he is found to be ineligible 
for them. However, claimants, such as the one in the matter before us, 
did not automatically lose anything by the enactment of Act 111. Act 
111 simply provided employers with the means to change a claimant’s 
disability status from total to partial by providing the requisite medical 
evidence that the claimant has a whole body impairment of less than 
35%, after receiving 104 weeks of TTD benefits. 

As this Court opined in Rose Corporation [v. Workers’ Compensation 
Appeal Board (Espada), 238 A.3d 551, 561 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020)], the 
General  Assembly  made  it  clear  in  Act  111  that  weeks  of  TTD  and 
partial disability paid by an employer/insurer prior to the enactment of 
Act 111 count as credit against an employer’s new obligations under 
Act 111. In Rose Corporation, we said, in reference to Act 111: 
 

 

The plain language of Section 3 establishes a mechanism 
by which employers/insurers may receive credit for weeks 
of  compensation  previously  paid.  First,  Section  3(1) 
provides  that  an  employer/insurer  “shall  be  given  credit 
for weeks of total disability compensation paid prior to the 
effective  date  of  this  paragraph”  for  purposes  of 
determining whether the 104 weeks of total disability had 
been  paid.  This  104  weeks  is  important  because,  under 
both  the  former  and  current  IRE  provisions,  a  claimant 
need  not  attend  an  IRE  until  after  the  claimant  receives 
104 weeks of total compensation. 77 P.S. §[511.3(1)] . . . . 
See Section  3(1)  of  Act 111.  Therefore,  pursuant  to 
Section  3(1),  an  employer/insurer  will  receive  credit 
towards this 104 weeks for any weeks of total disability 
benefits  that  were  previously  paid  prior  to  Act  111’s 
enactment.  Second,  an  employer/insurer  will  be  given 
credit  for  any  weeks  of  partial  disability  compensation 
paid prior to enactment of Act 111 “[f]or the purposes of 
determining the total number of weeks of partial disability 
compensation payable under [S]ection 306(a.3)(7) of the 

7 

A]s  we  made  clear  in Rose  Corporation,  the  104-week  and  credit 
provisions  of  Act 111  were  explicitly  given  retroactive  effect by the 
clear language used by the General Assembly. 

[The c]laimant, herein, argues that the General Assembly cannot take 
away his “vested rights” and that it did not explicitly express an intent 
to apply the provisions of Act 111 in any sort of a retroactive fashion . 
. . As we noted above, [the c]laimant’s “vested rights” have not been 
abrogated by Act 111. Further, we believe it is clear that the General 
Assembly  intended  for  the  104-week  and  credit  weeks  provisions  of 
Act  111  to  be  given  retroactive  effect,  where,  as  we  noted  in Rose 
Corporation, it stated in plain language it was doing so.  

. . . .  

 [

[A]ct.”  Section  3(2)  of  Act  111.  In  short,  any  weeks  of 
partial  disability  previously  paid  will  count  towards  the 
500-week cap on such benefits. 
 

Rose Corp., 238 A.3d at 561-62. 

 

 

  P

ierson,  252  A.3d  at  1179-80.    Similarly,  in  Hutchinson  v.  Annville  Township 

(Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board), 260 A.3d 360, 366 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2021), 

relying on our precedent in Pierson, we rejected a claimant’s assertion that applying 

Act 111 to injuries predating its enactment renders it improperly retroactive.   

 

  Here,  as  in  Pierson  and  Hutchinson,  the  application  of  Act  111  did  not 

automatically change Claimant’s disability status or otherwise deprive him of vested 

rights under the Act.  Claimant had no vested right in his benefits as calculated at 

the time of his injury because there are reasonable expectations under the Act that 

benefits may change over time.  Thus, Act 111’s application to Claimant’s case was 

not retroactive simply because it applied to a condition that existed on its effective 

date.  Act 111 merely provided a mechanism for Employer to pursue a change in 

Claimant’s disability status.  Act 111 contains no limiting language regarding the 

date of injury or disability award.  In fact, Act 111’s IRE mechanisms apply only 

8 

after  an  employee  has  received  104  weeks  of  total  disability  benefits,  which 

necessarily contemplates application to injuries predating Act 111.  Thus, Claimant’s 

argument that Act 111 is not applicable to his case because his injury occurred before 

Act 111’s enactment lacks merit. 

IV. Conclusion 

Based  on  the  above,  and  consistent  with  this  Court’s  precedent,  this  Court 

rejects Claimant’s constitutional challenge to Act 111.  Accordingly, we affirm the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
