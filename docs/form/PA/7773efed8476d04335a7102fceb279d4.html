COMMENTARY 

Regarding Subsection B, “documents for any case filed with, accepted and 
maintained by a court or custodian” are those not created by a court or custodian, such as 
pleadings and motions. Indices are tools for identifying specific cases.

the wrong document or court personnel misspells a name in the caption. 

Regarding Subsection G, the definition of “custodian” includes clerks of court, 

prothonotaries, clerks of orphans’ court and magisterial district judges, for example. The 
definition does not include those entities listed in Pa.R.A.P. 3191 who receive copies of 
briefs filed in an appellate court or a register of wills.

Regarding Subsection K, this definition is derived from the definition of 

“health information” provided in 45 C.F.R. § 160.103 (HIPAA). Examples of case 
records that would fall within this exclusion are: drug and alcohol treatment records, 
psychological reports in custody matters, and DNA reports. 

Regarding Subsection M, amici curiae are not parties. See Pa.R.A.P. 531.

Section 2.0 Statement of General Policy 

A.  This policy shall govern access by the public to caserecords. 

B.  Security, possession, custody, and control of case records shall generally 
be the responsibility of the applicable custodian and designated staff. 

C.  Facilitating access by the public shall not substantially impede the orderly 

conduct of court business. 

D.  A court or custodian may not adopt more restrictive or expansive access 
protocols than provided for in this policy. Nothing in this policy requires 
a court or custodian to provide remote access to case records. However, if 
a court or custodian chooses to provide remote access to any of its case 
records, access shall be provided in accordance with Section 10.0. 

COMMENTARY 

The Electronic Case Record Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System 

of Pennsylvania provides for access to the statewide case management systems' web 
docket sheets and requests for bulk data. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Page 4 of 22 

Section 3.0 Access to Case Records 

All case records shall be open to the public in accordance with this policy.

Section 4.0 Requesting Access to Case Records 

A.  When desiring to inspect or copy case records, a member of the public 
shall make an oral request to the applicable custodian, unless otherwise 
provided by a local rule or an order issued by a court of record. 

B.  When the information that is the subject of the request is complex or 
voluminous, the custodian may require a written request. If the 
requestor does not submit a written request when required, access may 
be delayed until the written request is submitted or a time when an 
individual designated by the custodian is available to monitor such 
access to ensure the integrity of the case records is maintained. 

C.  Requests shall identify or describe the records sought with specificity to 
enable the custodian to ascertain which records are being requested. 

COMMENTARY 

Public access requests to the courts and custodians are routinely straightforward 

and often involve a limited number of records. Therefore, artificial administrative 
barriers should not be erected so as to inhibit making these requests in an efficient 
manner. 

This policy provides the courts and custodians latitude to establish appropriate 

administrative protocols for viewing/obtaining case records remotely. However, the 
definition of “remote access” in Section 1.0 clarifies that a request under this section is 
neither necessary nor expected under this policy. 

Nonetheless, Subsection B provides a custodian with the flexibility to require that 

a more complex request be submitted in writing to avoid misunderstandings and errors 
that can often result in more time being expended to provide the requested information 
than is necessary. This approach is not novel; submission of a written request form has 
been a longstanding practice under the Unified Judicial System’s Electronic Case Record 
Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania. 

Subsection C does not require a requestor to identify a case by party or case 
number in order to have access to the files, but the request shall clearly identify or 
describe the records requested so that court personnel can fulfill the request. 

Written requests should be substantially in the format designed and published by 

the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts. 

Page 6 of 22 

Section 5.0 Responding to Requests for Access to Case Records 

A.  A custodian shall fulfill a request for access to case records as promptly as 

possible under the circumstances existing at the time of the request. 

B.  If a custodian cannot fulfill the request promptly or at all, the custodian shall 
inform the requestor of the specific reason(s) why access to the information 
is being delayed or denied. 

C.  If a custodian denies a written request for access, the denial shall be in 

writing. 

D.  Except as provided in Subsection E, relief from a custodian's written denial 
may be sought by filing a motion or application with the court for which the 
custodian maintains the records. 

E.  Relief from a magisterial district court may be sought by filing an appeal 
with the president judge of the judicial district or the president judge’s 
designee. Relief from a written denial by the Philadelphia Municipal Court 
may be sought by filing a motion with the president judge of Philadelphia 
Municipal Court or the president judge’s designee. 

COMMENTARY 

Given that most public access requests for case records are straightforward and 

usually involve a particular case or matter, custodians should process the same in an 
expeditious fashion. 

There are a number of factors that can affect how quickly a custodian may 
respond to a request. For example, the custodian’s response may be slowed if the request 
is vague, involves retrieval of a large number of case records, or involves information 
that is stored off-site. Ultimately, the goal is to respond timely to requests for case 
records. 

In those unusual instances in which access to the case records cannot be granted 

in an expeditious fashion, the custodian shall inform the requestor of the specific 
reason(s) why access to the information is being delayed or denied, which may include: 

• 

• 
• 

the request involves such voluminous amounts of information that the 
custodian is unable to fulfill the same without substantially impeding the 
orderly conduct of the court or custodian’s office; 
records in closed cases are located at an off-site facility; 
a particular file is in use by a judge or court staff. If a judge or court staff 
needs the file for an extended period of time, special procedures should be 
considered, such as making a duplicate file that is always available for 
public inspection; 

Page 7 of 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 

• 

the requestor failed to pay the appropriate fees, as established pursuant to 
Section 6.0 of this policy, associated with the request; 
the requested information is restricted from access pursuant to applicable 
authority, or any combination of factors listed above. 

With respect to Subsection D, an aggrieved party may seek relief from a denial 
of a written request for access consistent with applicable authority (for example, in an 
appellate court, Pa.R.A.P. 123 sets forth procedures for applications for relief under 
certain circumstances, or pertinent motion practice at the trial court level).

Section 6.0 Fees 

A.  Unless otherwise provided by applicable authority, fees for duplication by 
photocopying or printing from electronic media or microfilm shall not 
exceed $0.25 per page. 

B.  Except as provided in Subsection C, a custodian shall establish a fee 
schedule that is (1) posted in the court facility in an area accessible to 
the public, and (2) posted on the custodian’s website. 

C.  Any fee schedule for a magisterial district court shall be established 

by the president judge of the judicial district by local rule pursuant to 
Pa.R.J.A. No. 103(c). The fee schedule shall be publicly posted in an 
area accessible to the public. 

COMMENTARY 

Reasonable fees may be imposed for providing public access to case records 
pursuant to this policy and in accordance with applicable authority. This section does not 
authorize fees for viewing records that are stored at the court facility. 

To the extent that the custodian is not the court, approval of the fee schedule by 

the court may be necessary. 

An example of applicable authority setting forth photocopying fees is 42 Pa.C.S. 

§ 1725(c)(1)(ii) that provides the Clerk of Orphans’ Court of the First Judicial District 
shall charge $3 per page for a copy of any record. See also 42 P.S. § 21032.1 (providing 
authority for the establishment of fees in orphans' court in certain judicial districts). In 
addition, the copying fees for appellate court records are provided for in 204 Pa. Code § 
155.1.  However, copies of most appellate court opinions and orders are available for free 
on the Unified Judicial System’s website, www.pacourts.us.

Section 7.0 Confidential Information 

A.  The following information is confidential and shall not be included in 
any document filed with a court or custodian, except on a Confidential 
Information Form filed contemporaneously with the document: 

1. 
2. 

3. 
4. 
5. 

6. 

Social Security Numbers; 
Financial Account Numbers, except an active financial account 
number may be identified by the last four digits when the financial 
account is the subject of the case and cannot otherwise be 
identified; 
Driver License Numbers; 
State Identification (SID) Numbers; 
Minors’ names and dates of birth except when a minor is charged 
as a defendant in a criminal matter (see 42 Pa.C.S. § 6355); and 
Abuse victim’s address and other contact information, including 
employer’s name, address and work schedule, in family court 
actions as defined by Pa.R.C.P. No. 1931(a), except for victim's 
name. 

This section is not applicable to cases that are sealed or exempted from 
public access pursuant to applicable authority. 

B.  The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts shall design and 

publish the Confidential Information Form. 

C.  Reserved. 

D.  Parties and their attorneys shall be solely responsible for complying with 
the provisions of this section and shall certify their compliance to the 
court. The certification that shall accompany each filing shall be 
substantially in the following form: “I certify that this filing complies with 
the provisions of the Case Records Public Access Policy of the Unified 
Judicial System of Pennsylvania that require filing confidential 
information and documents differently than non-confidential information 
and documents.” The certification language may be inserted in the 
document to be filed, thereby obviating the need for a separate 
certification form. 

Page 10 of 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E.  A court or custodian is not required to review or redact any filed document 
for compliance with this section. A party’s or attorney’s failure to comply 
with this section shall not affect access to case records that are otherwise 
accessible. 

F.  If a filed document fails to comply with the requirements of this section, a 
court of record may, upon motion or its own initiative, with or without a 
hearing, order the filed document sealed, redacted, amended or any 
combination thereof. A court of record may impose sanctions, including 
costs necessary to prepare a compliant document for filing in accordance 
with applicable authority. 

G.  If a filed document fails to comply with the requirements of this section, 
a magisterial district court may, upon request or its own initiative, with 
or without a hearing, order the filed document redacted, amended or 
both. 

H.  This section shall apply to all documents for any case filed with a court or 

custodian on or after the effective date of this policy. 

COMMENTARY 

This section is not applicable to cases that are sealed or exempted from public 

access pursuant to applicable authority, for example, cases filed under the Juvenile Act 
that are already protected by 42 Pa.C.S. § 6307, and Pa.Rs.J.C.P. 160 and 1160. 

Attorneys are reminded that Rules 1.1 and 1.6 of the Rules of Professional 

Conduct require familiarity and compliance with this policy. 

While Pa.R.C.P. No. 1931 is suspended in most judicial districts, the reference to 

the rule is merely for definitional purposes. 

Unless constrained by applicable authority, court personnel and jurists are advised 

to refrain from inserting confidential information in court-generated case records (e.g., 
orders, notices) when inclusion of such information is not essential to the resolution of 
litigation, appropriate to further the establishment of precedent or the development of 
law, or necessary for administrative purposes. For example, if a court’s opinion contains 
confidential information and, therefore, must be sealed or heavily redacted to avoid 
release of such information, this could impede the public’s access to court records and 
ability to understand the court's decision. 

When using a Confidential Information Form, the drafter shall indicate where in the 

document confidential information has been omitted by use of an alternative reference. For 
example, the drafter could insert minors’ initials in the document, while listing full names on 
the Confidential Information Form. If more than one child has the same initials, a different 
moniker should be used (e.g., child one, child two, etc.). The Confidential Information Form 

Page 11 of 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

published by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts includes alternative references 
that should be used by the drafter. 

Most filings in magisterial district courts are completed on statewide forms 

designed by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts. Safeguarding the 
information set forth in this Section for magisterial district courts is achieved through 
the use of a Confidential Information Form in tandem with other administrative 
protocols (e.g., a public access copy page that shields confidential information was 
added to the citation form set). 

With regard to Subsection D, the certification of compliance is required whether 

documents are filed in paper form or via an e-filing system. Moreover, the certification is 
required on every document filed with a court or custodian regardless of whether the filing 
contains “confidential information” requiring safeguarding under this policy. The 
certification is included on many forms that parties and attorneys file with the magisterial 
district courts. For documents e-filed through PACFile, available in the appellate courts 
and some common pleas courts, the filer can certify compliance by checking a box. In 
addition, the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts included the certification on 
the Confidential Information Form, as well as created a sample stand-alone certification 
form that parties and attorneys may use or simply incorporate the language into their filed 
documents. This form may be found on the Unified Judicial System’s website, 
www.pacourts.us. 

With regard to Subsection E, a court or custodian is not required to review or 

redact documents filed by a party or attorney for compliance with this section. However, 
such activities are not prohibited. 

With regard to Subsection F, any party may make a motion to the court of record to 

cure any defect(s) in any filed document that does not comport with this section. 

With regard to Subsection G, any party may file a request form designed and 
published by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts with a magisterial district 
court when there is an allegation that a filing was made with that court that does not 
comply with this policy. 

With regard to Subsection H, the policy was amended in 2021 to implement the 

Confidential Information Form as the single statewide method to safeguard the information 
identified in Subsection A. Prior to this amendment, an appellate or trial court could permit 
the filing of any document in two versions, a “Redacted Version” and 
“Unredacted Version,” rather than require the use of the Confidential Information Form.

Section 8.0 Confidential Documents 

A.  The  following  documents  are  confidential  and  shall  be  filed  with  a 
court  or  custodian  under  a  cover  sheet  designated  “Confidential 
Document Form”: 

1.  Financial Source Documents; 
2.  Minors’ educational records; 
3.  Medical/Psychological records; 
4.  Children and Youth Services’ records; 
5.  Marital Property Inventory and Pre-Trial Statement as provided in 

6.  Income and Expense Statement as provided in Pa.R.C.P. No. 

Pa.R.C.P. No. 1920.33; 

1910.27(c); and 

7.  Agreements between the parties as used in 23 Pa.C.S. §3105. 

This section is not applicable to cases that are sealed or exempted from public 
access pursuant to applicable authority. 

B.  The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts shall design and 

publish the Confidential Document Form. 

C.  Confidential documents submitted with the Confidential Document Form 

shall not be accessible to the public, except as ordered by a court. 
However, the Confidential Document Form or a copy of it shall be 
accessible to the public. 

D.  Parties and their attorneys shall be solely responsible for complying with 
the provisions of this section and shall certify their compliance to the 
court. The certification that shall accompany each filing shall be 
substantially in the following form: “I certify that this filing complies 
with the provisions of the Case Records Public Access Policy of the 
Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania that require filing confidential 
information and documents differently than non-confidential information 
and documents.” The certification language may be inserted in the 
document to be filed, thereby obviating the need for a separate 
certification form. 

E.  A court or custodian is not required to review any filed document for 

compliance with this section. A party’s or attorney’s failure to comply 
with this section shall not affect access to case records that are otherwise 
accessible. 

Page 13 of 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

F.  If confidential documents are not submitted with the Confidential 

Document Form, a court of record may, upon motion or its own initiative, 
with or without a hearing, order that any such documents be sealed. A court 
of record may also impose appropriate sanctions for failing to comply with 
this section. 

G.  If a filed document fails to comply with the requirements of this section,a 
magisterial district court may, upon request or its own initiative, with or 
without a hearing, order that any such documents be sealed. 

H.  This section shall apply to all documents for any case filed with a court or 

custodian on or after the effective date of this policy. 

COMMENTARY 

This section is not applicable to cases that are sealed or exempted from public 

access pursuant to applicable authority, such as Juvenile Act cases pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. 
§ 6307, and Pa.Rs.J.C.P. 160 and 1160. 

Attorneys are reminded that Rules 1.1 and 1.6 of the Rules of Professional 

Conduct require familiarity and compliance with this policy. 

Unless constrained by applicable authority, court personnel and jurists are advised 

to refrain from attaching confidential documents to court-generated case records (e.g., 
orders, notices) when inclusion of such information is not essential to the resolution of 
litigation, appropriate to further the establishment of precedent or the development of 
law, or necessary for administrative purposes. For example, if a court’s opinion contains 
confidential information and, therefore, must be sealed or heavily redacted to avoid 
release of such information, this could impede the public’s access to court records and 
ability to understand the court's decision. 

Examples of “agreements between the parties” as used in Subsection (A)(7) 

include the following types of agreements: marital settlement, post-nuptial, pre- 
nuptial, and property settlement. See 23 Pa.C.S. § 3105 for more information about 
agreements between parties. 

With regard to Subsection D, the certification of compliance is required whether 

documents are filed in paper form or via an e-filing system. Moreover, the certification is 
required on every document filed with a court or custodian regardless of whether the filing 
contains a “confidential document” requiring safeguarding under this policy. The 
certification is included on many forms that parties and attorneys file with the magisterial 
district courts. For documents e-filed through PACFile, available in the appellate courts 
and some common pleas courts, the filer can certify compliance by checking a box. In 
addition, the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts included the certification on

form that parties and attorneys may use or simply incorporate the language into their filed 
documents. This form may be found on the Unified Judicial System’s website,

Section 9.0 Limits on Public Access to Case Records at a 

Court Facility 

The following information shall not be accessible by the public at a court facility: 

A.  Case records in proceedings under 20 Pa.C.S. § 711(9), including but not 

limited to case records with regard to issues concerning recordation of birth 
and birth records, the alteration, amendment, or modification of such birth 
records, and the right to obtain a certified copy of the same, except for the 
docket and any court order or opinion; 

B.  Case records concerning incapacity proceedings filed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. 
§§ 5501-5555, except for the docket and any final decree adjudicating a 
person as incapacitated; 

C.  Any Confidential Information Form as set forth in Section 7.0; 

D.  Any document filed with a Confidential Document Form as set forth in 

Section 8.0; 

E.  Information sealed or protected pursuant to court order; 

F.  Information to which access is otherwise restricted by federal law, state law, 

or state court rule; and 

G.  Information presenting a risk to personal security, personal privacy, or the 
fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice, as determined by the 
Court Administrator of Pennsylvania with the approval of the Chief Justice. 
The Court Administrator shall publish notification of such determinations in 
the Pennsylvania Bulletin and on the Unified Judicial System’s website. 

H.  The Unredacted Version of any document filed in accordance with 

prior versions of this policy. 

COMMENTARY 

Unless constrained by applicable authority, court personnel and jurists are advised 

to refrain from inserting confidential information in or attaching confidential documents 
to court-generated case records (e.g., orders, notices) when inclusion of such information 
is not essential to the resolution of litigation, appropriate to further the establishment of 
precedent or the development of law, or necessary for administrative purposes. For 
example, if a court’s opinion contains confidential information and, therefore, must be 
sealed or heavily redacted to avoid release of such information, this could impede the 
public’s access to court records and ability to understand the court's decision.

With respect to Subsection F, Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 104(a), 
Pa.R.A.P. 104(a), provides that the appellate courts may make and amend rules of court 
governing their practice. The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts shall from 
time to time publish a list of applicable authorities that restrict public access to court 
records or information. This list shall be published on the Unified Judicial System’s 
website and in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. In addition, all custodians shall post this list in 
their respective court facilities in areas accessible to the public and on the custodians’ 
websites. 

With respect to Subsection G, the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts 

shall include any such determinations in the list of applicable authorities referenced 
above. The same provision appears in the Electronic Case Record Public Access Policy 
of the Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania. The provision is intended to be a safety 
valve to address a future, extraordinary, unknown issue of statewide importance that 
might escape timely redress otherwise. It cannot be used by parties or courts in an 
individual case. 

With regard to Subsection H, the policy was amended in 2021 to implement the 

Confidential Information Form as the single statewide method to safeguard the 
information identified in Subsection A. Prior to this amendment, an appellate  
 
or trial court could permit the filing of any document in two versions, a “Redacted  
 
Version” and “Unredacted Version,” rather than require the use of the Confidential 
Information Form.

Section 10.0 Limits on Remote Access to Case Records 

A.  The following information shall not be remotely accessible by the public: 

1.  The information set forth in Section 9.0; 
2.  In criminal cases, information that either specifically identifies or from 
which the identity of jurors, witnesses (other than expert witnesses), or 
victims could be ascertained, including names, addresses and phone 
numbers; 

3.  Transcripts lodged of record, excepting portions of transcripts when 

attached to a document filed with the court; 

4.  In Forma Pauperis petitions; 
5.  Case records in family court actions as defined in Pa.R.C.P. No. 

1931(a), except for dockets, court orders and opinions; 
6.  Case records in actions governed by the Probate, Estates and 

Fiduciaries Code, Adult Protective Services Act and the Older 
Adult Protective Services Act, except for dockets, court orders and 
opinions; and 

7.  Original and reproduced records filed in the Supreme Court, Superior 
Court or Commonwealth Court as set forth in Pa.R.A.P. 1921, 1951, 
2151, 2152, and 2156. 

B.  With respect to Subsections A(5) and A(6), unless otherwise restricted 

pursuant to applicable authority, dockets available remotely shall contain only 
the following information: 

1.  A party’s name; 
2.  The city, state, and ZIP code of a party’s address; 
3.  Counsel of record’s name and address; 
4.  Docket number; 
5.  Docket entries indicating generally what actions have been taken or 

are scheduled in a case; 
6.  Court orders and opinions; 
7.  Filing date of the case; and 
8.  Case type. 

C.  Case records remotely accessible by the public prior to the effective date of 

this policy shall be exempt from this section. 

COMMENTARY 

Remote access to the electronic case record information residing in the 
Pennsylvania Appellate Court Case Management System (PACMS), the Common Pleas 
Case Management System (CPCMS) and the Magisterial District Judges System 
(MDJS) is provided via web dockets, available on https://ujsportal.pacourts.us/, and is 
governed by the Electronic Case Record Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial 
System of Pennsylvania.

Depending upon individual court resources, some courts have posted online 
docket information concerning civil matters. If a court elects to post online docket 
information concerning family court actions and actions governed by the Probate, 
Estates and Fiduciaries Code, Adult Protective Services Act and the Older Adult 
Protective Services Act, the docket may only include the information set forth in 
Subsection B. This information will provide the public with an overview of the case, its 
proceedings and other pertinent details, including the court's decision. Release of such 
information will enhance the public’s trust and confidence in the courts by increasing 
awareness of the procedures utilized to adjudicate the claims before the courts, as well as 
the material relied upon in reaching determinations. This provision does not impact what 
information is maintained on the docket available at the court facility. 

Access to portions of transcripts when attached to a document filed with the court 

in family court actions is governed by Subsection A(5). While Pa.R.C.P. No. 1931 is 
suspended in most judicial districts, the reference to the rule is merely for definitional 
purposes.

Section 11.0 Correcting Clerical Errors in Case Records 

A.  A party, or the party’s attorney, seeking to correct a clerical error in a case 

record may submit a written request for correction. 

1.  A request to correct a clerical error in a case record of the Supreme 

Court, Superior Court, or Commonwealth Court shall be submitted to 
the prothonotary of the proper appellate court. 

2.  A request to correct a clerical error in a case record of a court of 

common pleas, the Philadelphia Municipal Court, or a magisterial 
district court shall be submitted to the applicable custodian. 

B.  The request shall be made on a form designed and published by the 

Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts. 

C.  The requestor shall specifically set forth on the request form the information 
that is alleged to be a clerical error and shall provide sufficient facts, including 
supporting documentation, that corroborate the requestor’s allegation that the 
information in question is in error. 

D.  The requestor shall provide copies of the request to all parties to the case. 

E.  Within 10 business days of receipt of a request, the custodian shall respond in 
writing to the requestor and all parties to the case in one of the following 
manners: 

1.  The request does not contain sufficient information and facts to 
determine what information is alleged to be in error, and no 
further action will be taken on the request. 

2.  The request does not concern a case record that is covered by this 

policy, and no further action will be taken on the request. 

3.  A clerical error does exist in the case record and the information 

in question has been corrected. 

4.  A clerical error does not exist in the case record. 

5.  The request has been received and an additional period not exceeding 
30 business days is necessary to complete a review of therequest. 

F.  A requestor may seek review of the custodian’s response under Subsections 

E(1)-(4) within 10 business days of the mailing date of the response.

1.  The request for review shall be submitted on a form that is designed 
and published by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts. 

2.  The request shall be reviewed by the judge(s) who presided over the 
case. However, if the request for review concerns a magisterial 
district court’s decision, it shall be reviewed by the president judge 
or his/her designee. 

COMMENTARY 

Case records are as susceptible to clerical errors and omissions as any other public 

record. The power of the court to correct errors in its own records is inherent. E.g., 
Jackson v. Hendrick, 746 A.2d 574 (Pa. 2000). It is important to emphasize that this 
section does not provide a party who is dissatisfied with a court’s decision, ruling or 
judgment a new avenue to appeal the same by merely alleging there is an error in the 
court’s decision, ruling or judgment. Rather, this section permits a party to “fix” 
information that appears in a case record which is not, for one reason or another, correct. 

Particularly in the context of Internet publication of court records, a streamlined 

process is appropriate for addressing clerical errors to allow for prompt resolution of 
oversights and omissions. For example, to the extent that a docket in a court’s case 
management system incorrectly reflects a court’s order, or a scanning error occurred with 
regard to an uploaded document, such clerical inaccuracies may be promptly corrected by 
the appropriate court staff, upon notification, without a court order. Since 2007, the 
Electronic Case Record Public Access Policy of the Unified Judicial System of 
Pennsylvania has provided a similar procedure for any errors maintained on the web 
docket sheets of the PACMS, CPCMS and MDJS. The procedure has successfully 
addressed clerical errors on docket entries in a timely and administratively simple 
manner. 

A party or party’s attorney is not required to utilize the procedures set forth in this 
section before making a formal motion for correction of a case record in the first instance. 
Alleged inaccuracies in orders and judgments themselves must be brought to the attention 
of the court in accordance with existing procedures. 

This section is not intended to provide relief for a party's or attorney's failure to 

comply with Sections 7.0 and 8.0 of this policy. Sections 7.0 and 8.0 already provide for 
remedial action in the event that non-compliance occurs. 

With respect to this section, a custodian includes, but is not limited to, the county 
prothonotaries, clerks of orphans’ court, clerks of the court, and magisterial district judges. 

A log of all corrections made pursuant to this section may be maintained by the 

custodian, so that there is a record if an objection is made in the future. Such a log 
should remain confidential. It is suggested that custodians include a registry entry on the 
case docket when a request is received and a response is issued.

Section 12.0 Continuous Availability of Policy 

A copy of this policy shall be continuously available for public inspection in 

every court and custodian’s office and posted on the Unified Judicial System's website.
