Received 03/17/2020  Middle District 

No.  53  MM 2020 

BERKS COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA 

In  Re:  23rd  Judicial  District 

Emergency Judicial Order 
No.  20-3264 
CP-06-AD-17-2020 

Administrative  Order 

AND  NOW,  this  17th  day  of  March,  2020,  pursuant to  the  March  16,  2020  Order of 
the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court (Judicial Administration  Docket No.  531  In  Re:  General 
the  March  17,  2020  Declaration  of  Judicial 

Statewide  Judicial  Emergency)  and 
Emergency in  this Judicial District,  Thomas  G.  Parisi,  President  Judge of the 23rd Judicial 
District, to provide for the safety  of court  personnel,  court  users and the public on  account 
of the current  COVID-19  pandemic,  hereby  ORDERS  the following  actions,  pursuant  to 

Rule  of Judicial  Administration  1925(b): 

1.  The time calculations for the purposes of time computation relevant to court cases, 
judicially  mandated  action  or  other judicial  business,  as  well  as  time  deadlines, 
subject to constitutional restrictions, are suspended  beginning  March 17,  2020 and 

ending April  14,  2020; 

2.  There will  be  an  expanded  use of advanced communication  technology to 

conduct court proceedings where  practicable, subject to  constitutional 
restrictions.  Transportation  of incarcerated / detained  out of county witnesses, 
criminal defendants, juvenile  defendants  or similar  persons for Berks  County 

hearings,  trials  or other proceedings shall  be avoided  if such  persons  may 

adequately participate  by  other means  or  if their appearance  is  waived  upon 

consent  of counsel.  When  possible use  email and  electronic mediums to create, 

file,  and  transmit documents  and  Court  Orders.  Remote work  by  staff may  be 

approved  by their Court Supervisor  or Department  Head  and  is encouraged 

where  possible. 

3.  The  Operation  of  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  600  is  hereby  suspended  within  this 

judicial  district,  beginning  on  March  17,  2020,  and  ending  April  14,  2020.  The 

constitutionally  protected  right  of  the  criminal  defendant  shall  continue  to  be 

upheld,  but  a  delay for  a  COVID-19  related  reason  shall  be attributed  to  the  Berks 

County  judiciary  during  the  time  period  of  the  judicial  emergency,  as  the 

circumstances  giving  rise  to  this  Order and  the  suspension  may  be relevant  to the 

constitutional  analysis.  This  time  shall  be  excluded  from  the  time  computation 

under  Rule  of Criminal  Procedure  600(c). 

4.  Jury trials,  both  criminal  and  civil,  shall  be  postponed  until  at least  March  31,  2020 

subject to  further extensions prior to  March  31st. 

If any bench  trials  are scheduled, 

an  order confirming  the intention  to proceed must  be  issued  by the assigned judge. 

5.  Criminal  judges  should  move  to  a  modified  schedule,  "staggering"  lists  to  avoid 

larger  groups  of  participants  and  attorneys.  Judges  are  authorized  to  liberally 

continue  proceedings,  even  without  a  continuance  motion  or an  agreement of the 

parties,  for  reasons  materially  pertaining  to  the  current  COVID-19  pandemic,  to 

avoid  the  transportation  of  participants  from  other  potentially  affected  areas  or 

other  reasons.  Priority  should  be  given  to  those  cases  that  can  be  resolved  and 

are  likely  to  result  in  a  release  from  incarceration.  All  other cases,  as  practicable, 

should  be  rescheduled.  Where  possible,  the  presence  of  defendants  may  be 

waived,  such  as status  hearings where a  final disposition  is  not  anticipated,  based 

on  assertion  of  counsel.  Counsel  are  encouraged  to  utilize  email  or  other 

electronic communication  or  phone  calls  to  request continuances  in  advance. 

6.  Essential  judicial  services,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  by  way  of example, 

preliminary  arraignments,  bail establishment hearings,  protection  from abuse  act 

proceedings,  emergency  dependency  hearings,  and  shelter and  detention 

hearings,  or where  absent such  proceedings,  there  would  be  a  threat of 

irreparable harm  shall  continue to be  heard. This  is  not an  exclusive  list. 

7.  Security:  Single  entry  point for all  County visitors  shall  be through  the  Berks 

County Services  Center from  6am  to 9:45pm.  All  employees  shall enter through 

the Services  Center  only  during  these  hours.  Single  entry point  for  all  County 

visitors and  employees from 9:45pm  to  6am  shall  be through  the Courthouse 

entry  on  Court  Street.  Eric Weaknecht,  Berks  County  Sheriff,  and  his  deputies, 

in  conjunction with  SGI,  shall  oversee the  designated  point  of entry. 

8.  Access to  the  Berks  County  Courthouse and  Services  Center shall  be  limited 

exclusively to  elected  officials whose  offices  are  maintained  in  the  respective 

Courthouse  and  Services  Center,  county commissioners,  department  heads, 

essential  employees  who  have  not been  permitted  to work  remotely,  attorneys 

with court  business,  parties to  a  case that has  not  otherwise been  continued, 

subpoenaed  witnesses  or  victims  in  proceedings  being  held,  prospective  jurors  at 

the time  trials  resume,  members  of the public  who have  official  County  business 

that must be  conducted  in  person  or  have prescheduled appointments with the 

Court or  County departments,  and  members of the  media.  Any  person who

welfare  of the  public,  county and  court  employees  and  users  of the  Berks  County

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
