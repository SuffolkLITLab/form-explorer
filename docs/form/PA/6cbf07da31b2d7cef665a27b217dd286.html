Appeal from the Order Entered June 8, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County 
Criminal Division at No(s):  CP-09-CR-0007286-2007 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., STABILE, J., and KING, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY KING, J.:   

 

 

      FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

Appellant, James P. Beal, appeals pro se from the order entered in the 

Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, which dismissed his pro se motion for 

return of property as untimely.1  We affirm.   

A prior  panel of this Court set  forth  the relevant facts and procedural 

history of this appeal as follows:  

[O]n  February  29,  2008,  Appellant  pleaded  guilty  to  a 
plethora of drug offenses, and was originally sentenced by 
the trial court to an aggregate period of incarceration of not 
less  than  20  nor  more  than  41  years’  incarceration  and  a 
fine in excess of $2.8 million.  Appellant filed a direct appeal, 
challenging the validity of his guilty pleas and the imposition 
of  his  sentence  “without  reference”  to  the  sentencing 

____________________________________________ 

1 “Preliminarily, we note that ‘[b]oth this Court and the Commonwealth Court 
have  jurisdiction  to  decide  an  appeal  involving  a  motion  for  the  return  of 
property filed pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 588.’”  Commonwealth v. Caviness, 
243 A.3d 735, 738 (Pa.Super. 2020) (quoting Commonwealth v. Durham, 
9 A.3d 641, 642 (Pa.Super. 2010), appeal denied, 610 Pa. 583, 19 A.3d 1050 
(2011)).

guidelines.    On  January  19,  2011,  we  determined  that 
Appellant had waived all issues pertaining to his guilty pleas, 
but vacated the sentence and remanded the case “so that 
the  trial  court  can  consider  the  applicable  sentencing 
guidelines and impose a punishment that is consistent with 
the Sentencing Code.”   

n December 22, 2011, the trial court convened a hearing, 
after which it re-sentenced Appellant to not less than 18 nor 
more than 40 years’ incarceration plus costs.  It re-imposed 
the fine exceeding $2.8 million.  Appellant filed a motion for 
reconsideration,  which  the  trial  court  denied.    Appellant 
appealed  to  this  Court.    A  panel  of  this  Court  affirmed 
Appellant’s judgment of sentence.  On December 11, 2014, 
our Supreme Court denied Appellant’s petition for allowance 
of appeal.   

 Appellant pro se filed [a] PCRA petition on September 28, 
2015.  In his petition, Appellant raised, among other things, 
mandatory minimum sentencing claims under  Alleyne [v. 
United States, 570 U.S. 99, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 
314 (2013),] as well as claims for ineffective assistance of 
counsel.    The  PCRA  court  appointed  counsel,  who  filed 
amended petitions.  On May 8, 2017, Appellant pro se filed 
a motion requesting the appointment  of new counsel.   On 
January 24, 2018, the PCRA court granted the motion and 
appointed a new counsel, who subsequently filed a no-merit 
letter … on April 24, 2018.  On May 17, 2018, the PCRA court 
issued  a  Pa.R.Crim.P.  907  notice  of  its  intent  to  dismiss 
Appellant’s  PCRA  petition  without  a  hearing.    On  May  25, 
2018, Appellant filed his response to the no-merit letter.  On 
June 7, 2018, the PCRA court issued an order, granting in 
part  and  denying  in  part  Appellant’s  post-conviction  relief 
petition.  Specifically, the PCRA court granted the petition to 
the  extent  it  challenged  Appellant’s  sentence  under 
Alleyne.  In this regard, the PCRA court granted him a new 
sentencing hearing without the application of the mandatory 
minimum  sentencing  provisions  of  18  Pa.C.S.A.  §  7508, 
relating  to  drug  trafficking  sentencing  and  penalties.    The 
PCRA  court,  however,  denied  Appellant  relief  on  his 
ineffectiveness claim with respect to the voluntariness of his 
guilty pleas.

Commonwealth v. Beal, No. 2474 EDA 2018, unpublished memorandum at 

- 2 - 

1-4  (Pa.Super.  filed  September  19,  2019)  (internal  citations  and  footnotes 

omitted).    Appellant  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  from  the  portion  of  the  order 

denying relief on his ineffectiveness claim, and this Court affirmed the order 

on September 19, 2019.   

 

Thereafter, the trial court proceeded with Appellant’s resentencing.  On 

February 18, 2020, the court appointed new counsel to represent Appellant at 

the resentencing hearing.  The court conducted the resentencing hearing on 

December  14,  2020.    At  that  time,  the  court  imposed  another  aggregate 

sentence of eighteen (18) to forty (40) years’ imprisonment.2  Appellant did 

not file post-sentence motions or a notice of appeal.   

 

On  February  25,  2021,  Appellant  filed  a  pro  se  motion  for  return  of 

property seeking the return of various items that were seized in conjunction 

with his arrest.3  The Commonwealth filed an answer on April 14, 2022.  In it, 

the  Commonwealth  argued  that  the  court  should  dismiss  the  motion  as 

untimely filed.  The court conducted a hearing on June 8, 2022.  After receiving 

2 In a separate order entered July 14, 2021, the court also vacated all fines 
previously imposed in the prior sentencing orders.   

 Appellant was incarcerated when he filed the pro se motion.  Although the 
trial court did not docket the pro se motion until March 8, 2021, the motion 
included  a  certificate  of  service  indicating  that  Appellant  submitted  it  for 
mailing on February 25, 2021.  Giving Appellant the benefit of the “prisoner 
mailbox  rule,”  we  deem  the  motion  as  filed  on  February  25,  2021.    See 
Commonwealth v. Chambers, 35 A.3d 34 (Pa.Super. 2011), appeal denied, 
616 Pa. 625, 46 A.3d 715 (2012) (explaining prisoner mailbox rule provides 
that pro se prisoner’s document is deemed filed on date he delivers it to prison 
authorities for mailing).

argument from the parties, the court dismissed Appellant’s pro se motion as 

untimely filed.4  (See N.T. Hearing, 6/8/22, at 24).   

 

Appellant timely filed a pro se notice of appeal on June 30, 2022.  On 

July 7, 2022, the court ordered Appellant to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise 

statement of errors complained of on appeal.  Appellant timely filed a pro se 

Rule 1925(b) statement on July 22, 2022.   

 

Appellant now raises one issue for our review:  

The trial court committed an error of law and abused [its] 
discretion  when  [it]  dismissed  [A]ppellant’s  motion  for 
return  of  property  that  was  filed  within  thirty  days  of  the 
final disposition of his case as untimely.   
 

(Appellant’s Brief at 4).   

 

Appellant  acknowledges  that  the  court  conducted  his  resentencing 

hearing on December 14, 2020.  Appellant emphasizes, however, that he was 

also litigating a federal habeas corpus petition at the time of the resentencing 

hearing.  Appellant alleges that his resentencing “was contingent on the fact 

that  [he]  would  withdraw  his  federal  [habeas  corpus  filing]  and  not  pursue 

any future appeals in regards to this criminal matter.”  (Id. at 8).  After the 

resentencing hearing, Appellant maintains that he “contacted the federal court 

____________________________________________ 

4  Despite  the  court’s  on-the-record  denial  of  Appellant’s  pro  se  motion,  the 
court  also  determined  that  “Appellant  actually  only  sought  the  return  of  … 
family and other personal photographs.”  (Trial Court Opinion, filed 8/4/22, at 
8).    Consequently,  the  court  “informally  directed  the  Commonwealth  to  go 
back  and  look  at  the  file  and  evidence  seized  in  the  case,  and  if  the 
Commonwealth was able to locate these sentimental photographs, [it] should 
return those to Appellant.”  (Id.) (citing N.T. Hearing at 24-25).

and  filed  the  appropriate  paperwork  to  have  his  …  federal  habeas  corpus 

withdrawn so that he could receive final disposition of his criminal matters.”  

(Id.)    Appellant  notes  that  the  federal  court  dismissed  the  habeas  corpus 

petition on January 29, 2021.   Under these circumstances, Appellant  insists 

that the “final disposition” of his criminal case did not occur until the federal 

court  dismissed  the  habeas  corpus  petition,  and  he  timely  filed  the  pro  se 

motion for return of property within thirty days of the federal court’s order.  

(Id. at 10).  Appellant concludes that this Court must vacate the order that 

dismissed the motion as untimely.  We disagree.   

 

The  following  principles  govern  our  review  of  an  order  disposing  of  a 

motion for return of property:  

The  standard  of  review  applied  in  cases  involving  motions 
for  the  return  of  property  is  an  abuse  of  discretion.    In 
conducting  our  review,  we  bear  in  mind  that  it  is  the 
province  of  the  trial  court  to  judge  the  credibility  of  the 
witnesses  and  weigh  the  testimony  offered.    It  is  not  the 
duty  of  an  appellate  court  to  act  as  fact-finder,  but  to 
determine whether there is sufficient evidence in the record 
to support the facts as found by the trial court.   
 

Caviness, supra at 738 (quoting Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 172 A.3d 

1162, 1165 (Pa.Super. 2017)).   

 

Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  588  governs  the  filing  of  a 

motion for return of property as follows:  

(A)  A  person  aggrieved  by  a  search  and  seizure, 
whether or not executed pursuant to a warrant, may move 
for the return of the property on the ground that he or she 

   

Rule 588.  Motion for Return of Property 

- 5 - 

J-S40041-22 

J-S40041-22 

is entitled to lawful possession thereof.  Such motion shall 
be filed in the court of common pleas for the judicial district 
in which the property was seized.   
 

Pa.R.Crim.P. 588(A).   

 

“Courts in this Commonwealth have long recognized that a motion for 

the return of property is timely if it is filed ‘during the pendency of the criminal 

proceedings, or while the trial court retains jurisdiction for thirty days following 

its  disposition  of  the  criminal  case.””    Caviness,  supra  at  739  (quoting 

Rodriguez, supra at 1164 n.10).   

Although Rule 588 does not directly address the question of 
timing, it is sufficiently precise with regard to who may file 
a  return  motion  and  where  the  motion  must  be  filed  to 
permit  us  to  discern  that  a  criminal  defendant  has  an 
opportunity to file a motion seeking the return of property 
while  the  charges  against  him  are  pending.    Specifically, 
return motions are filed by “a person aggrieved by a search 
and seizure” and must “be filed in the court of common pleas 
for  the  judicial  district  in  which  the  property  was  seized.”  
Pa.R.Crim.P. 588(A).  Additionally, a return motion may be 
filed pre-trial and joined with a motion to suppress.  Id. at 
588(C).  Pursuant to Rule 588, therefore, a return motion is 
timely when it is filed by an accused in the trial court while 
that court retains jurisdiction, which is up to thirty days after 
disposition.  See 42 Pa.C.S. § 5505 (providing that a trial 
court  retains  jurisdiction  to  modify  or  rescind  any  order 
within thirty days of its entry, if no appeal has been taken).   
 

Commonwealth v. Allen, 630 Pa. 577, 589, 107 A.3d 709, 716-17 (2014) 

(internal footnotes omitted).   

 

Additionally,  “federal  habeas  corpus  proceedings  are  civil  in  nature 

because they exist for the enforcement of a right to personal liberty, rather 

than as a stage of the state criminal proceedings or as an appeal therefrom[.]”

J-S40041-22 

Commonwealth  v.  Speight,  ___  Pa.  ___,  249  A.3d  1075,  1084  (2021) 

(internal  citation  and  quotation  marks  omitted).    “Thus,  a  proper  grant  of 

federal habeas relief to a state prisoner does not purport to revise or interfere 

with the state court’s criminal judgment.”  Id.   

 

Instantly, the trial court analyzed Rule 588 and the relevant case law, 

and  it  determined  that  Appellant’s  federal  habeas  corpus  petition  had  “no 

effect  on  the  time  frame  in  which  Appellant  can  file  a  Rule  588  motion  for 

return  of  property.”    (Trial  Court  Opinion  at  12).    Consequently,  the  court 

provided the following timeliness analysis:  

Appellant was resentenced, for the final time, on December 
14,  2020….    Therefore,  at  the  latest,  Appellant  had  until 
January  13,  2021,  to  file  a  motion  for  return  of  property 
pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 588(A), while [the trial c]ourt still 
retained jurisdiction.  See Allen[, supra at 589, 107 A.3d] 
at  717.    Appellant  did  not  file  his  motion  for  return  of 
property  until  February  25,  2021.    As  such,  Appellant’s 
motion is patently untimely….   
 

(Id. at 13).  We agree with this analysis and emphasize that the disposition 

of Appellant’s federal habeas corpus petition did not impact the finality of the 

criminal  proceedings  in  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas.    See  Speight,  supra.  

On this record, the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Appellant’s 

pro se motion for return of property.5  See Caviness, supra.  Accordingly, 

we affirm.   

____________________________________________ 

5  On  the  last  page  of  his  brief,  Appellant  provides  an  alternative  argument 
asking this Court “to take into consideration that  during this  time period, it 
(Footnote Continued Next Page)

was  one  of  the  worst  ongoing  outbreaks  of  Covid-19  …  at  SCI  Huntingdon 
where  [Appellant]  was  residing  at  such  time.”    (Appellant’s  Brief  at  11).  
Appellant did not include this argument in his Rule 1925(b) statement, and it 
is  waived  on  this  basis.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Landis,  277  A.3d  1172, 
1181  (Pa.Super.  2022)  (reiterating  that  issues  not  raised  in  Rule  1925(b) 
statement will be deemed waived).  Moreover, the Commonwealth correctly 
analyzes the relevant judicial emergency orders for Bucks County, which “did 
not affect the timeliness of filings in January of 2021.”  (Commonwealth’s Brief 
at 11).  See also Commonwealth v. Woolstrum, 271 A.3d 512 (Pa.Super. 
2022) (rejecting appellant’s argument that PCRA petition was timely in light 
of  judicial  emergency  orders  entered  in  response  to  Covid-19  pandemic; 
appellant’s late filing was due to flawed and unsupported reasoning regarding 
when his judgment of sentence became final).
