Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered March 28, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County Criminal Division at

EFORE:  OLSON, J., NICHOLS, J., and PELLEGRINI, J.* 

MEMORANDUM BY PELLEGRINI, J.:  

 

FILED:  March 16, 2023 

 

Mannar  Abdulhadi  Kadhim  (Kadhim)  appeals  from  the  judgment  of 

sentence  imposed  in  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  of  Allegheny  County  (trial 

court) following his bench conviction of receiving stolen property (RSP) and 

firearms  not  to  be  carried  without  a  license.1    Kadhim  challenges  the  trial 

court’s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of the firearm recovered from 

his person.  We affirm. 

I. 

 

This case stems from a December 2020 incident during which Kadhim 

reported his vehicle stolen to Police Officer William Kelly of the McKees Rocks

Police Department at a gas station.  Kadhim was homeless and living out of 

his  car  at  that  time.    After  Kadhim  requested  a  courtesy  transport  to  his 

girlfriend’s  workplace,  a  pat-down  of  his  person  for  officer  safety  led  to 

recovery of a stolen firearm from his waistband.  Kadhim moved to suppress 

evidence of the firearm before trial by contesting the validity of the search. 

A. 

Officer Kelly was the sole witness at the October 4, 2021 suppression 

hearing.    He  testified  that  on  December  15,  2020,  at  about  10:45  p.m., 

Kadhim approached him at a Speedway while he was fueling his police vehicle.  

Kadhim reported that his car had been stolen and Officer Kelly took the report, 

along with Police Officer Dimichele.2  Kadhim asked the officers if he could call 

his girlfriend and Officer Dimichele gave  Kadhim his cell phone to  place  the 

call.  Kadhim “then requested a courtesy transport to . . . where his girlfriend 

was working,” and the officers agreed to transport him.  (N.T. Suppression, 

10/04/21,  at  7).    Officer  Kelly  testified  that  when  Kadhim  asked  for 

transportation, he responded, “Yeah, we’ll give you a ride down there, but I’m 

going to check you for weapons before you get in the back of the patrol car, 

and I asked him if he had any weapons.”  (Id.).  Officer Kelly explained that 

he advised Kadhim of this “for officer safety and for his safety” and that “every 

time  someone  gets  in  my  patrol  vehicle,  I  pat  them  down.”    (Id.  at  7-8).

J-A06032-23 

Although this procedure is not a written police department policy, it is a routine 

practice to protect officer safety. 

When Officer Kelly asked Kadhim if he had any weapons, Kadhim “stated 

that he did not have a firearm and put his hands up.”  (Id. at 8).  The officer 

proceeded to pat him down.  Officer Kelly testified to his belief that Kadhim 

“was  consenting  to  a  search  or  pat-down”  when  he  put  his  hands  up,  that 

Kadhim never told him “No” or indicate that he no longer wanted a ride.  (Id. 

at  9).    Officer  Kelly  recounted  that  during  the  pat-down,  “upon  feeling  his 

waistband, I felt the distinct shape of a firearm.”  (Id.).  The officers placed 

Kadhim’s hands behind his back and handcuffed him. 

On  cross-examination,  Officer  Kelly  acknowledged  that  during  his 

interaction  with  Kadhim  before  the  pat-down,  he  observed  no  bulge  in  his 

waistband, furtive movements or any other indication that he was carrying a 

weapon.  Officer Kelly testified that “there was nothing to indicate prior to [the 

pat down that he] was armed or dangerous.”  (Id. at 16).  Officer Kelly also 

advised that if Kadhim had refused the pat-down, he was free to leave or walk 

to his girlfriend’s workplace.  The trial court took the matter under advisement 

and entered an order denying the suppression motion on October 13, 2021. 

Kadhim  waived  his  right  to  a  jury  trial  and  proceeded  to  a  stipulated 

bench trial on March 28, 2022.  The parties stipulated to the facts outlined in 

the Affidavit of Probable Cause, which reflected that after Officer Kelly found 

B.

J-A06032-23 

the firearm, Kadhim uttered, “I stole the gun.”  (Affidavit of Probable Cause, 

12/16/20,  at  2).    Officer  Kelly  cleared  the  gun  which  was  loaded  with  one 

round in the chamber and six rounds in the magazine.  After Kadhim was given 

Miranda3 warnings at the police station, he admitted that he “took the firearm 

from a bag [at a female friend’s home] when she wasn’t looking.”  (Id.).  A 

county  records  check  of  the  serial  number  on  the  gun  showed  that  it  was 

owned by Yolanda Gonzalez.  Ms. Gonzalez was in a relationship with Kadhim 

at the time, and she relayed to police that she did not know that the firearm 

was missing; she thought the gun was in her closet where she stored it and 

she did not give Kadhim permission to take it. 

The trial court found Kadhim guilty of RSP and the firearms offense and 

sentenced him to an aggregate term of one year of probation.  Kadhim timely 

appealed and he and the trial court complied with Rule 1925.  See Pa.R.A.P. 

1925(a)-(b). 

 

On  appeal,  Kadhim  challenges  the  trial  court’s  denial  of  his  pre-trial 

motion to suppress.  He claims the warrantless search of his person was illegal 

and that evidence  of the firearm recovered  from his waistband should have 

been suppressed.4  (See Kadhim’s Brief, at 7, 15-24).  According to Kadhim, 

 When reviewing an order denying a motion to suppress evidence, 

  4

II.

the  Commonwealth  failed  to  establish  any  exception  to  the  warrant 

requirement, including express or implied consent, and that “it is impossible 

to reasonably find that Kadhim impliedly consented” to the pat-down.  (Id. at 

“The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, 

Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution guarantee the right of the people 

to  be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and  possessions  from 

unreasonable  searches  and  seizures.”    Luczki,  supra  at  542  (citation 

omitted).    “It  is  well-settled  that  a  search  conducted  without  a  warrant  is 

unreasonable  and  unconstitutional  unless  an  established  exception  to  the 

[w]e  may  consider  only  the  Commonwealth’s  evidence  and  so 
much of the evidence for the defense as remains uncontradicted 
when  read  in  the  context  of  the  record  as  a  whole.    Where  the 
record  supports  the  factual  findings  of  the  trial  court,  we  are 
bound by those facts and may reverse only if the legal conclusions 
drawn therefrom are in error.  An appellate court, of course, is not 
bound by the suppression court’s conclusions of law.  It is within 
the suppression court’s sole province as factfinder to pass on the 
credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. 
 

Commonwealth v. Luczki, 212 A.3d 530, 542 (Pa. Super. 2019) (citations 
omitted). 

 We agree with Kadhim and the trial court that the holding of Terry vs. Ohio, 
392 U.S. 1 (1968), does not apply to the circumstances of this case, as Officer 
Kelly did not conduct a Terry stop, which would have required a showing of 
reasonable  suspicion  that  Kadhim  was  involved  in  criminal  activity.    (See 
Kadhim’s Brief, at 18; Trial Court Opinion, 6/15/22, at 6); see also Terry, 
supra at 30.

warrant requirement applies.”  Commonwealth v. Carmenates, 266 A.3d 

1117, 1124 (Pa. Super. 2021) (en banc) (citation omitted). 

One such exception to the warrant requirement is consent.  See id.  To 

establish  a  valid  consensual  search,  the  Commonwealth  must  demonstrate 

that  the  consent  was  given  during  a  legal  police  interaction  and  that  the 

consent was given voluntarily.  See id.  “To be considered valid, the consent 

must be the product of an essentially free and unrestrained choice—not the 

result of duress or coercion, express or implied, or a will overbourne—under 

the  totality  of  the  circumstances.”    Id.    (citation  omitted).    Additionally, 

consent may be express or implied.  See Commonwealth v. Fredrick, 230 

A.3d 1263, 1267 (Pa. Super. 2020).  The standard for measuring the scope of 

an individual’s consent is one of “objective reasonableness,” considering what 

“a reasonable person would have understood by the exchange between the 

officer and the person who gave the consent.”  Id. (citation omitted). 

The record in this case reflects that Kadhim initiated contact with Officer 

Kelly by approaching him to report that his car had been stolen.  At that time, 

Kadhim was a victim of theft, and Officer Kelly had no reason to suspect that 

he  was  involved  in  any  criminal  activity.    Kadhim  then  prolonged  the 

interaction by asking to borrow a cell phone to call his girlfriend and requesting 

a courtesy transport to her workplace.  Officer Kelly was amenable to assisting 

Kadhim but  advised him of the  need  to submit to a weapons  search before 

entering his police vehicle in accordance with his routine practice for courtsey

transport.    Officer  Kelly  explained  that  he  took  this  measure  for  safety 

purposes to prevent any person who may be armed from entering his vehicle, 

that Kadhim was under no obligation to get into the vehicle, and that he was 

free to secure other transportation or walk away from the scene.  When Officer 

Kelly informed Kadhim of the need for a pat-down, Kadhim did not in any way 

object.    Instead,  Kadhim  told  Officer  Kelly  that  he  was  not  armed  and, 

unprompted, raised his arms in the air. 

Given  the  foregoing,  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  we 

conclude  that  Officer  Kelly  reasonably  interpreted  Kadhim’s  gestures  as 

consent  to  the  search  of  his  person,  and  that  the  warrantless  search  was 

constitutionally  permissible.    There  is  nothing  in  the  record  to  indicate  that 

Kadhim’s  implied  consent  to  the  pat-down  was  the  result  of  anything  other 

than his free will.  Because Kadhim impliedly and voluntarily consented to the 

search  of  his  person,  the  gun  seized  from  his  waistband  was  admissible  at 

trial.    Accordingly,  the  trial  court  did  not  err  in  denying  Kadhim’s  pre-trial 

motion to suppress.6 

____________________________________________ 

6  Kadhim’s  reliance  on  Commonwealth  v.  Davenport,  308  A.2d  85  (Pa. 
1973), which involved an appeal from an order denying suppression of a blood 
draw  taken  from  an  incarcerated  defendant  faced  with  first-degree  murder 
charges, is misplaced.  (See Kadhim’s Brief, at 19-23).  In Davenport, the 
county coroner extracted a blood sample from Davenport at the “instigation” 
of police, to compare with that of the deceased without judicial authorization.  
Our  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  Davenport’s  rights  under  the  Fourth 
Amendment were violated and that his motion to suppress should have been 
granted.  Although the Commonwealth contended that Davenport consented 

- 7 - 

____________________________________________ 

to  the  blood  draw by  holding  out  his  arm  and  not  voicing  an  objection,  the 
Court found this argument lacked merit where Davenport was not advised of 
the  reasons  for  the  blood  draw  or  who  had  authorized  it.    The  Court 
determined that Davenport’s action “constituted mere acquiescence, and not 
a  knowing  and  intelligent  waiver  of  his  Fourth  Amendment  rights.”  
Davenport, supra at 88. 

n stark contrast, Kadhim was not incarcerated nor was he under investigation 
for any crime when the search at issue occurred.  Instead, he was the victim 
of car theft who affirmatively sought police assistance with transportation, and 
the pat-down was merely a condition of the courtesy ride and a routine safety 
measure  conducted  to  prevent  armed  individuals  from  entering  patrol 
vehicles.
