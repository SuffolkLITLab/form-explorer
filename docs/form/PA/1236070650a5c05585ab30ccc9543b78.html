SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 

21 EM 2020 

IN RE: FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
â€”PHILADELPHIA MUNICIPAL COURT'S REQUEST 
PURSUANT TO PA.R.J.A. 1952(B)(2)(S) TO AUTHORIZE 
THE CONTINUATION OF THE PHILADELPHIA 
MUNICIPAL COURT LANDLORD-TENANT DIVERSION 
PROGRAM 

RESPONSE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA OFFICE OF ATTORNEY 
GENERAL IN SUPPORT OF PHILADELPHIA MUNICIPAL COURT'S 
REQUEST TO CONTINUE THE LANDLORD-TENANT DIVERSION 
PROGRAM 

Pursuant to this Court's order of October 28, 2021, the Pennsylvania Office 

of Attorney General (OAG) hereby files this Response in support of the 

Philadelphia Municipal Court's Request to Extend the Philadelphia Municipal 

Court Landlord-Tenant Diversion Program (filed Oct. 20, 2021, and granted in part 

on Oct. 28, 2021). 

For the reasons stated in the attached letter (Exhibit A), OAG respectfully 

asks the Court to extend authorization for the program beyond its current expiration 

on November 30, 2021. The Diversion Program has proven to be a great success, 

benefiting tenants and landlords alike, and is rightly heralded as a model for other 

programs across the country. Indeed, the success of Philadelphia's program has 

spurred interest in creating similar programs across the Commonwealth. OAG 

encourages the Court to authorize similar programs in other counties.

The Honorable Max Baer 
Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Pennsylvania 
Pennsylvania Judicial Center 
601 Commonwealth Avenue 
Suite 1500 
Harrisburg, PA 17106 

Dear Chief Justice Baer: 

I am writing regarding the Philadelphia Municipal Court Landlord-Tenant 

Diversion Program. I am grateful for the support you and your colleagues have shown for this 
important program, and I respectfully ask the Court to grant the request submitted by President 
Judge Patrick F. Dugan to extend authorization for the program beyond its current expiration on 
October 31, 2021. The Diversion Program has proven to be a great success, benefiting tenants 
and landlords alike, and is rightly heralded as a model for other programs across the country. 
Indeed, the success of Philadelphia's program has spurred interest in creating similar programs 
across the Commonwealth and I encourage the Court to authorize similar programs in other 
counties. 

As we are all aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous burdens on 

our communities and our public institutions, including our courts. An unprecedented number of 
families in Philadelphia and throughout the Commonwealth have struggled to pay their rent 
during this crisis. Meeting this emergency has required encouraging the use of mutually 
beneficial, non-litigation dispute resolution programs. In that spirit, the Diversion Program has 
been a resounding success: to date, more than ninety percent of mediations conducted under the 
program have avoided eviction. With the support of the Diversion Program, Philadelphia has 
helped more than 33,000 households access more than $200 million in rental assistance funds. 
Moreover, because records of eviction cases cannot be expunged, regardless of outcome, the 
Program's pre-filing requirement allows tenants who are able to reach agreement with their 
landlord to avoid being permanently marked as having been the target of an eviction proceeding. 

Chief Justice Baer 
October 22, 2021 
Page Two 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the Diversion 

Program, the Philadelphia Municipal Court received around 20,000 eviction complaints every 
year, impacting one in 14 Philadelphia renter households.' Historically, nearly two-thirds of 
these complaints were based exclusively on non-payment of rent .2 For landlords, non-payment 
can result in an inability to pay a mortgage and potential loss of the property. 3 For tenants, non-
payment can result from an inability to pay, but can also result from a lawful withholding in 
response to poor housing conditions that threaten habitability.`' 

Without the Diversion Program, eviction cases often suffer from a power and 

knowledge imbalance between the parties that can make achieving fair outcomes difficult. Only 
10% of tenants in eviction proceedings pre-pandemic reported having access to legal counsel, 
compared to 82% of landlords. 5 In 74% of eviction cases pre-pandemic, only the landlord was 
represented by counsel. Such an imbalance in access to representation between tenants and 
landlords benefits neither the Philadelphia Municipal Court nor the interests of justice. And an 
eviction for non-payment of rent benefits neither party: the tenant risks homelessness and must 
quickly secure other housing and move all of their belongings, while the landlord must quickly 
find a new tenant or lose money on a vacant property. 

Against this backdrop, the Diversion Program encourages fair, efficient, and 

mutually beneficial outcomes that reduce the burden on the Philadelphia Municipal Court. Each 
tenant is assigned a City-funded housing counselor who helps tenants understand their rights and 
communicate productively with the landlord. Counselors also assist tenants in assessing available 
financial resources, including applying for programs such as rental assistance or unemployment 
benefits. The mediation date typically occurs within a month, creating the opportunity for a 
resolution in less time than an eviction would normally require. 7 Mediations are facilitated by

trained mediators with the goal of reaching an agreement that works for 

everyoneâ€”the tenant remains in the home and the landlord receives regular payments of rent. 

The City has committed to fund and staff the Diversion Program through the end 

of 2024, and a majority of City Councilmembers are dedicated to supporting the program beyond 
that date as well. In addition, the City recently received an additional $35 million in federal rent 
assistance and expects to receive further federal funding in the coming months. President Judge 
Dugan and his colleagues are likewise committed to the program, having seen firsthand the 
benefits it produces for tenants, landlords, and the judicial system. I respectfully ask the Court to 
authorize the continued authorization of the Landlord-Tenant Diversion Program in Philadelphia 
and to support the development of similar programs across the Commonwealth. 

All the best, 

JOSH SHAPIRO
