Appellant 

 No. 1051 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered May 13, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-36-CR-0003488-2008 

EFORE:   STABILE, J., NICHOLS, J., and STEVENS, P.J.E.* 

MEMORANDUM BY NICHOLS, J.:             FILED: MARCH 22, 2023 

Appellant  Donnelly  Joseph  LeBlanc  appeals  pro  se  from  the  order 

denying  his  third  Post  Conviction  Relief  Act1  (PCRA)  petition  as  untimely.  

Appellant argues that the PCRA court erred in denying his petition without a 

hearing.  We affirm. 

We adopt the facts and procedural history set forth in the PCRA court’s 

opinion.  See PCRA Ct. Op., 9/21/22, at 1-7.  Briefly, Appellant was convicted 

of  involuntary  deviate  sexual  intercourse  and  related  charges  for  sexually 

assaulting  a  minor  victim  multiple  times  in  2008.    On  December  28,  2009, 

Appellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of twenty-five to fifty years’ 

incarceration.  On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment of

sentence  and  our  Supreme  Court  denied 

further 

review. 

  See 

Commonwealth v. LeBlanc, 165 MDA 2010, 2010 WL 6795737 (Pa. Super. 

filed  Nov.  1,  2010)  (unpublished  mem.),  appeal  denied,  23  A.3d  541  (Pa. 

2011).    Appellant  subsequently  filed  a  timely  first  PCRA  petition  in  2011, 

followed by an untimely second petition in 2013, both of which were denied 

by  the  PCRA  court.    This  Court  affirmed  the  PCRA  court’s  denial  of  both 

petitions on appeal.  See Commonwealth v. LeBlanc, 2127 MDA 2014, 2015 

WL  6663637  (Pa.  Super.  filed  Sep.  2,  2015)  (unpublished  mem.); 

Commonwealth v. LeBlanc, 548 MDA 2016, 2016 WL 7422767 (Pa. Super. 

filed Dec. 23, 2016) (unpublished mem.). 

Appellant filed the instant pro se PCRA petition, his third, on December 

16, 2021.  The PCRA court issued an order dismissing Appellant’s petition on 

May 13, 2022.2  Appellant subsequently filed a notice of appeal3 and a court-

____________________________________________ 

2 We note that the PCRA court failed to issue a Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 notice before 
denying relief.  However, a PCRA court’s failure to issue a Rule 907 notice is 
not  reversible  error  where  the  record  is  clear  that  the  petition  is  untimely.  
See  Commonwealth  v.  Zeigler,  148  A.3d  849  (Pa.  Super.  2016); 
Commonwealth v. Taylor, 65 A.3d 462 (Pa. Super. 2013).  Here, because 
Appellant’s petition is clearly untimely, the PCRA court’s failure to comply with 
Rule 907 does not entitle him to relief.  

  We  note  that  the  PCRA  court  entered  an  order  denying  Appellant’s  PCRA 
petition on May 13, 2022.  Therefore, Appellant had thirty days, or until June 
13, 2022, in which  to file a timely  notice of appeal.   See  Pa.R.A.P. 903(a).  
Appellant  filed  his  notice  of  appeal  on  July  26,  2022,  making  it  facially 
untimely.  However, our review of the record reveals that the docket entry for 
the May 13, 2022 order denying Appellant’s PCRA petition does not contain a 
notation  regarding  service  of  the  order  on  Appellant.    See  Pa.R.Crim.P. 
114(C)(2)(c) (providing that trial court criminal docket entries shall contain, 
(Footnote Continued Next Page)

J-S06028-23 

J-S06028-23 

ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement.  The PCRA court issued a Rule 1925(a) 

opinion  reiterating  that  Appellant’s  petition  was  untimely  and  declining  to 

address his substantive claims. 

On appeal, Appellant raises the following issues for review: 

1.  The [PCRA court’s] refusal to disqualify itself is contrary to and 
in conflic[t] with clearly established state and federal law and 
the Constitution. 

2.  The  [PCRA  court’s]  denial,  without  notice,  of  post-conviction 
[relief]  is  contrary  to  and  in  conflict  with  clearly  established 
state and federal law and the Constitution. 

3.  The  [PCRA  court’s]  denial  of  post-conviction  [relief]  without 
hearing is contrary to clearly established state and federal law, 
the  Constitution  and,  based  upon  an  unreasonable 
determination of the facts and documents presented.  

4.  The  [PCRA  court]  abused  its  discretion  as  a  matter  of  law  in 
issuing a [Rule] 1925(b) [o]rder requiring Appellant to include 
a “developed supporting argument” in his statement of matters 
complained of on appeal. 

inter  alia,  “the  date  of  service  of  the  order  or  court  notice”);  see  also 
Commonwealth v. Hess, 810 A.2d 1249, 1253 (Pa. 2002) (noting that Rule 
114’s language leaves no question that trial court clerk’s obligations regarding 
docket  entries  are  not  discretionary);  In  re  L.M.,  923  A.2d  505,  509 
(interpreting similar civil rule, Pa.R.Civ.P. 236, and holding that where there 
is no indication on trial court docket that notice has been given, appeal period 
has not started to run).   

oreover, we note that the order denying Appellant’s PCRA petition appears 
to have only  been  served on Appellant’s prior counsel.   Because the record 
fails to indicate when Appellant was served with the order denying his PCRA 
petition,  we  conclude  there  was  a  breakdown  in  the  court’s  operation  and 
decline to quash the appeal.  See Commonwealth v. Braykovich, 664 A.2d 
133 (Pa. Super. 1995) (noting that this Court may permit enlargement of the 
filing  period  in  extraordinary  circumstances,  such  where  there  was  a 
breakdown in the processes of the court).

5.  The  [PCRA  court’s]  failure  to  file  an  opinion  pursuant  to 
Pa.R.A.P.  1925(a)(1)  is  contrary  to  clearly  established  law,  a 
violation of the Constitution and, an ambush, sandbagging the 
parties in litigation. 

6.  The  [PCRA  court’s]  dismissal  of  [Appellant’s  PCRA  petition] 
without  opportunity  for  amendment  is  contrary  to  clearly 
established  law,  the  reasoning  set  forth  in  the  district  court 
opinion and, in violation of the Constitutions of this state and 
the United States. 

Appellant’s Brief at 2 (some formatting altered). 

Our review of the denial of PCRA relief is limited to “whether the record 

supports  the  PCRA  court’s  determination  and  whether  the  PCRA  court’s 

decision  is  free  of  legal  error.”    Commonwealth v. Lawson,  90  A.3d  1, 4 

(Pa. Super. 2014) (citation omitted). 

“[T]he  timeliness  of  a  PCRA  petition  is  a  jurisdictional  requisite.” 

Commonwealth v. Brown, 111 A.3d 171, 175 (Pa. Super. 2015).  A PCRA 

petition, “including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one 

year of the date the judgment becomes final” unless the petitioner pleads and 

proves  one  of  three  statutory  exceptions.    42  Pa.C.S.  §  9545(b)(1).    A 

judgment of sentence becomes final for PCRA purposes “at the conclusion of 

direct  review,  including  discretionary  review  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  the 

United States and Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of time 

for seeking the review.”  42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3).   

It is the PCRA petitioner’s “burden to allege and prove that one of the 

timeliness  exceptions  applies.”    Commonwealth  v.  Albrecht,  994  A.2d 

1091, 1094 (Pa. 2010) (citation omitted and some formatting altered).  If a 

- 4 - 

J-S06028-23 

petition is untimely, and none of the timeliness exceptions are met, courts do 

not  have  jurisdiction  to  address  the  substance  of  the  underlying  claims.  

Commonwealth v. Cox, 146 A.3d 221, 227 (Pa. 2016). 

Here, Appellant’s judgment of sentence became final on September 5, 

2011, ninety days after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied his petition 

for allowance of appeal and the time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari 

in the United States Supreme Court expired.  See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3); 

U.S. Sup. Ct. R. 13.  Accordingly, Appellant had until September 5, 2012, to 

file a timely PCRA petition.  See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1).  Appellant’s instant 

PCRA petition, filed on December 16, 2021, is therefore facially untimely.  In 

his brief, Appellant does not claim that the instant petition is timely, nor does 

he attempt to invoke any of the PCRA’s timeliness exceptions.  See 42 Pa.C.S. 

§  9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).    Instead,  Appellant  raises  various  claims  concerning 

errors by the PCRA court, argues that he cannot prove that he met a timeliness 

exception without a hearing, and claims that his failure to invoke a timeliness 

exception was a “defect” which required the PCRA court to provide him with 

opportunity to amend his petition.  See Appellant’s Brief at 7-18. 

Because  Appellant’s  petition  is  facially  untimely  and  Appellant  neither 

pled nor proved a timeliness exception under the PCRA, he has failed to meet 

the  jurisdictional  threshold  for  a  court  to  consider  the  merits  of  his  claims.  

See Cox, 146 A.3d at 227; see also Brown, 111 A.3d at 175.  Therefore, 

the PCRA court correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to review 

- 5 - 

the merits of Appellant’s petition.  See Lawson, 90 A.3d at 4.  Accordingly, 

we affirm. 

Order affirmed.
