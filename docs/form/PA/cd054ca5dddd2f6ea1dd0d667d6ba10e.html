Appellant 

 No. 1277 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered February 14, 2022, 
in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County,  
Criminal Division at No(s):  CP-39-CR-0001199-2021. 

EFORE:  DUBOW, J., KUNSELMAN, J., and NICHOLS, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY KUNSELMAN, J.:  

 

     FILED MARCH 17, 2023 

Gary Paul Coles appeals from his judgment of sentence imposed after 

he pled guilty to sexual abuse of children.  Additionally, Coles’ counsel filed a 

petition  to  withdraw  representation  and  an  accompanying  brief  pursuant  to 

Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).  Upon review, we grant counsel’s 

petition, and affirm the judgment of sentence. 

 

On October 4, 2021, Coles entered an open guilty plea to one count of 

sexual abuse of children (dissemination of child pornography) and 19 counts 

of sexual abuse of children (possession of child pornography).1  Following a 

hearing,  the  trial  court  sentenced  Coles  to  an  aggregate  term  of  24  to  60 

months’ incarceration.  No post-sentence motion was filed.

NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

____________________________________________ 

1 18 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 6312(c) and (d). 

  

  

Coles filed this timely appeal.  Counsel filed a petition to withdraw from 

representation  and  an  Anders  brief  with  this  Court.    Coles  did  not  retain 

independent counsel or file a pro se response to the Anders brief. 

Before we may consider the issues raised in the Anders brief, we must 

first  consider  counsel’s  petition  to  withdraw  from  representation.    See 

Commonwealth  v.  Garang,  9  A.3d  237,  240  (Pa.  Super.  2010)  (holding 

that,  when  presented  with  an  Anders  brief,  this  Court  may  not  review  the 

merits  of  the  underlying  issues  without  first  passing  on  the  request  to 

withdraw).  Pursuant to Anders, when counsel believes an appeal is frivolous 

and wishes to withdraw from representation, counsel must do the following: 

(1)  petition  the  court  for  leave  to  withdraw  stating  that  after 
making  a  conscientious  examination  of  the  record,  counsel  has 
determined the appeal would be frivolous; (2) file a brief referring 
to any issues that might arguably support the appeal, but which 
does not resemble a no-merit letter; and (3) furnish a copy of the 
brief to the defendant and  advise him of his right to retain new 
counsel,  proceed  pro  se,  or  raise  any  additional  points  [the 
defendant] deems worthy of this Court's attention. 

Commonwealth  v.  Edwards,  906  A.2d  1225,  1227  (Pa.  Super.  2006) 

(citation  omitted).    In  Commonwealth  v.  Santiago,  978  A.2d  349  (Pa. 

2009), our Supreme Court addressed the second requirement of Anders, i.e., 

1) provide a summary of the procedural history and facts, with 
citations to the record; 

2) refer to anything in the record that counsel believes arguably 
supports the appeal; 

3) set forth counsel’s conclusion that the appeal is frivolous; and 

  (

  (

  (

the contents of an Anders brief, and required that the brief: 

- 2 - 

J-S43024-22 

4)  state  counsel’s  reasons  for  concluding  that  the  appeal  is 
frivolous.  Counsel should articulate the relevant facts of record, 
controlling case law, and/or statutes on point that have led to the 
conclusion that the appeal is frivolous. 
 

Santiago,  978  A.2d  at  361.    Once  counsel  has  satisfied  the  Anders 

requirements, it is then this Court’s responsibility “to conduct a simple review 

of the record to ascertain if there appear on its face to be arguably meritorious 

issues 

that  counsel, 

intentionally  or  not,  missed  or  misstated.”  

Commonwealth v. Dempster, 187 A.3d 266, 272 (Pa. Super. 2018).  

Here,  counsel  filed  both  an  Anders  brief  and  a  petition  for  leave  to 

withdraw  as  counsel.    Counsel's brief substantially  complies  with  our 

standards.    Additionally,  counsel's  petition  technically  satisfies  the  above 

requirements:  the petition states 1) that counsel made a conscientious review 

of the record and concluded that there were no meritorious issues and that 

the  appeal  was  frivolous;  and  2)  that  Coles  was  sent  a  copy  of  both  the 

Anders brief and the petition, along with a letter explaining his rights. 

However,  counsel’s  letter  to  Coles  misstates  his  rights.    Counsel 

incorrectly  advised  Coles  that  he  may  “request  the  appointment  of  counsel 

from the Superior Court should you feel that there are reasons for the same.”  

Additionally, in his petition to withdraw, counsel incorrectly advises Coles of a 

purported right to new counsel “by requesting from the Court the appointment 

of other alternative counsel, if he should so choose.”  Nevertheless, we decline 

to remand the matter for counsel to correct the deficiencies when this would 

- 3 - 

J-S43024-22 

  (

J-S43024-22 

serve  no  purpose  other  than  to  delay  resolution  of  this  appeal  and  waste 

judicial resources.2  See e.g. In re Adoption of V.G., 751 A2d 1174, 1178 

(Pa.  Super.  2000).    Because  Coles’  issue  is  patently  frivolous,  this  matter 

presents  a  rare  instance  where  we  decline  to  remand  for  a  more  accurate 

explanation of his rights.  We will address the merits of Coles’ issue. 

In the Anders brief, counsel sets forth one issue that Coles wishes to 

raise:    Whether  Coles’  sentence  was  manifestly  excessive  because  the  trial 

court focused on the severity of the offense and failed to fully and adequately 

consider any of the relevant factors set forth in 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9721(b).  See 

Anders Brief at 10.  This issue challenges the discretionary aspects of Coles’ 

sentence.  “Challenges to the discretionary aspects of sentencing do not entitle 

an  appellant  to  review  as  of  right.”    Commonwealth  v.  Moury,  992  A.2d 

162, 170 (Pa. Super. 2010).  This Court has explained that, to reach the merits 

of a discretionary sentencing issue, we must conduct a four-part analysis to 

determine:  

(1)  whether  the  appeal  is  timely;  (2)  whether  [a]ppellant 
preserved  his  issue;  (3)  whether  [a]pellant's  brief  includes  a 
concise  statement  of  the  reasons  relied  upon  for  allowance  of 
appeal  with  respect  to  the  discretionary  aspects  of  sentence  [in 
accordance with 2119(f)]; and (4) whether the concise statement 
raises  a  substantial  question  that  the  sentence  is  appropriate 
under the sentencing code. . . . [I]f the appeal satisfies each of 
these  four  requirements,  we  will  then  proceed  to  decide  the 
substantive merits of the case. 

____________________________________________ 

2  We  note  that  Coles  did  not  request  the  appointment  of  counsel  with  this 
Court.  Thus, counsel’s advice did not mislead Coles.

J-S43024-22 

Commonwealth  v.  Colon,  102  A.3d  1033,  1042–43  (Pa.  Super.  2014) 

(quoting Commonwealth v. Austin, 66 A.3d 798, 808 (Pa. Super. 2013)).   

Here,  Coles  has  satisfied  the  first  and  third  requirements  of  Colon.  

However,  upon  review  of  the  record,  we  observe  that  Coles  failed  to  file  a 

post-sentence  motion  or  raise  the  issue  with  the  trial  court  at  sentencing. 

Because  Coles  failed  to  preserve  a discretionary aspects of sentence issue 

either in a post-sentence motion or at the time of sentencing, he waived his 

discretionary aspects of sentencing issue on appeal.  “An issue that is waived 

is frivolous.”  Commonwealth v. Tukhi, 149 A.3d 881, 888–89 (Pa. Super. 

2016); see  also Commonwealth  v.  Kalichak,  943  A.2d  285,  291  (Pa. 

Super. 2008) (“Having been waived, pursuing this matter on direct appeal is 

frivolous.”).  Coles’ sentencing issue is frivolous.  

Furthermore, as required by Anders, we have independently reviewed 

the record to determine whether there are any non-frivolous issues present in 

this  case.    Our  review  of  the  record  discloses  no  other  non-frivolous  issues 

that Coles could raise that counsel overlooked.  See Dempster, supra. 

Having  concluded  that  there  are  no  meritorious  issues,  we  grant 

counsel’s petition to withdraw, and affirm the judgment of sentence.  

Petition  to  withdraw  as  counsel  granted.    Judgment  of  sentence 

- 5 - 

     

affirmed.
