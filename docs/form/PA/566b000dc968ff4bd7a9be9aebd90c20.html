NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

HANE ERNEST RICHARDSON       

 

Appellant 

 No. 1555 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered October 3, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-36-CR-0002693-2021 

EFORE:  BOWES, J., OLSON, J., and KUNSELMAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY BOWES, J.:               FILED: MARCH 21, 2023 

 

Shane Ernest Richardson appeals from the October 3, 2022 judgment 

of sentence of four and one-half to seventeen years of incarceration imposed 

following  his  convictions  for  aggravated  indecent  assault—person  less  than 

sixteen years of age and related charges.  After careful review, we vacate the 

sentencing order and remand with instructions. 

 

Over a four-year period between 2008 and 2011, Appellant repeatedly 

sexually  assaulted  two  sisters,  H.M.  and  K.W.,  in  his  home  in  Lancaster 

County.  On June 21, 2021, Appellant was charged with aggravated indecent 

assault of a person less than sixteen years of age, indecent assault of a person 

less  than  sixteen  years  of  age,  and  two  counts  of  unlawful  contact  with  a 

minor.    Following  a  four-day  jury  trial  at  which  H.M.  and  K.W.  testified, 

Appellant was convicted of all charges but one count of unlawful contact with 

a  minor.    The  trial  court  deferred  sentencing  so  that  the  Sexual  Offender

v. 

 

 

     

    S

   

 

 

  B

  

Assessment  Board  (“SOAB”)  could  evaluate  Appellant  and  a  pre-sentence 

report could be prepared.  The SOAB found that Appellant did not meet the 

criteria of a sexually violent predator.1  See N.T. Sentencing Hearing, 10/3/22, 

On October 3, 2022, the court imposed an aggregate term of four and 

one-half to seventeen years of incarceration.2  Id. at 28.  The trial court also 

noted  that,  while  it  had  no  control  over  what  conditions  the  department  of 

corrections imposed, it recommended that Appellant have no contact with the 

victims  or  their  family  members.    Id.  at  29.    Finally,  the  court  ordered 

Appellant  to  register  as  a  sex  offender  for  life  and  to  pay  $2,834.95  in 

restitution.    Id.  at  16-21,  31.    Although  the  trial  court  only  offered  a 

recommendation regarding a no-contact condition at the sentencing hearing, 

the sentencing order directed that Appellant have no contact with the victims 

and their family members, as follows: 

 

____________________________________________ 

1  Appellant  was  subjected  to  lifetime  registration  requirements  under 
Subchapter I of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA”) 
due  to  his  conviction  for  aggravated  indecent  assault.    See  42  Pa.C.S. 
§ 9799.55(b)(2)(i)(A). 

 Specifically, Appellant received the following sentence:  count 1 aggravated 
indecent assault (H.M.), three to ten years of incarceration; count 2 corruption 
of minors (H.M.), a concurrent term of one to seven years of incarceration; 
count 3 corruption of minors (K.W.), a concurrent term of one to seven years 
of  incarceration;  count  4  unlawful  contact  with  a  minor  (H.M.),  one  to  five 
years  of  incarceration  consecutive  to  count  1;  count  6,  indecent  assault 
(H.M.),  six  months  to  two  years  of  incarceration  consecutive  to  count  one.  
See N.T. Sentencing Hearing, 10/3/22, at 28.

No  Contact:  Defendant  to  have  no  contact  with  the  victim 
whatsoever. 

o  Contact  –  Victim’s  Family:    Defendant  is  to  have  no  contact 

with the victim’s family. 

See  Sentencing  Order,  10/5/22.    Appellant  did  not  file  a  post-sentence 

motion.    Instead,  this  timely  appeal  followed.    Both  the  trial  court  and 

Appellant have complied with the mandates of Pa.R.A.P. 1925.   

 

Appellant raises the following issue for our review:   

id the trial court err in ordering, as a condition of [Appellant’s] 
state sentence, that he could have no contact with the victims or 
their families, where the court had no jurisdiction to impose this 
condition,  as  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Corrections  has 
exclusive  authority  over  state  prison  conditions,  and  the 
Pennsylvania  Department  of  Probation  and  Parole  has  exclusive 
authority over state parole conditions? 

Appellant’s brief at 5. 

 

Initially,  we  observe  that  “[t]he  matter  of  whether  the  trial  court 

possesses the authority to impose a particular sentence is a matter of legality 

[of  the  sentence].”    Commonwealth  v.  Dennis,  164  A.3d  503,  510  (Pa. 

Super. 2017) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, 

he scope and standard of review applied to determine the legality 
of a sentence are well established.  If no statutory authorization 
exists for a particular sentence, that sentence is illegal and subject 
to correction.  An illegal sentence must be vacated.  In evaluating 
a  trial  court’s  application  of  a  statute,  our  standard  of  review  is 
plenary  and  is  limited  to  determining  whether  the  trial  court 
committed an error of law.

J-A09012-23 

Appellant  contends  that  the  trial  court  did  not  have  the  authority  to 

impose  a  condition  that  Appellant  have  no  contact  with  the  victims  or  their 

families.  See Appellant’s brief at 9-10.  We agree. 

This  Court  has  held  that  where  the  trial  court  imposes  a  maximum 

imprisonment  sentence  of  two  or  more  years,  the  Pennsylvania  Board  of 

Probation and Parole (“PBPP”) has exclusive authority over the terms of the 

defendant’s parole.  See 61 Pa.C.S. § 6132(a); see also Commonwealth v. 

Coulverson,  34  A.3d  135,  141  (Pa.Super.  2011)  (recognizing  “that  ‘the 

[PBPP]  has  exclusive  authority  to  determine  parole  when  the  offender  is 

sentenced  to  a  maximum  term  of  imprisonment  of  two  or  more  years’”) 

(quoting Commonwealth v. Mears, 972 A.2d 1210, 1211 (Pa.Super. 2009)).  

Further, the authority to impose a non-contact provision as a special condition 

of a defendant’s state incarceration rests with the Pennsylvania Department 

of Corrections (“DOC”).  See Commonwealth v. Olivo-Vazquez, 248 A.3d 

463 (Pa.Super. 2021) (non-precedential decision at *4) (finding the trial court 

lacked  statutory  authority  to  impose  a  non-contact  provision  as  part  of  an 

appellant’s  state  incarceration  sentence).    Therefore,  a  trial  court  does  not 

have statutory authority to impose conditions on a sentence of incarceration 

that exceeds two years, and “‘any condition the sentencing court purport[s] 

to  impose  on  [a  defendant’s]  state  parole  is  advisory  only.’”  Coulverson, 

supra at 141-42; see also 61 Pa.C.S. § 6134(b)(1), (2).   

Herein, the trial court imposed a sentence of imprisonment greater than 

two years, giving the DOC and PBPP exclusive authority over the terms of his 

- 4 - 

J-A09012-23 

incarceration and parole.  See Coulverson, supra at 141; see also Olivo-

Vazquez, supra at non-precedential decision *4.  Therefore, the sentencing 

court lacked statutory authority to impose incarceration and parole conditions 

upon Appellant.  Id.  In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court acknowledges 

the  illegality  of  the  sentence  it  issued,  explaining  that  the  conditions 

referenced by the court during sentencing were intended to be advisory to the 

PBPP  and  that  the  sentencing  order  stating  otherwise  amounted  to  an 

“unfortunate discrepancy.”  Trial Court Opinion, 12/7/22, at 5-6.  Whatever 

the  reason,  no  statutory  authority  exists  for  the  court  to  impose  such  a 

condition.   

However, the trial court does have the ability to make recommendations 

as to the conditions of Appellant’s supervision, and it clearly intended to do so 

in  this  case.    See  61  Pa.C.S.  §  6134;  Trial  Court  Opinion,  12/7/22,  at  5.  

Accordingly, we vacate the October 3, 2022 sentencing order and remand for 

the trial court to enter an order stating its recommendation to the DOC and
