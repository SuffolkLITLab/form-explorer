EMORANDUM OPINION   

PER CURIAM 

 

 

 

 

 

FILED:  March 21, 2023 

Justin D. Gilmore (Gilmore), pro se, petitions this Court for review of 

the Pennsylvania Parole Board’s (Board) March 24, 2022 order (mailed April 15, 

2022)1 affirming the Board’s decision recorded July 8, 2021 (mailed July 16, 2021).  

Gilmore presents one issue for this Court’s review: whether he was entitled to a jury 

for his parole revocation hearing.  After review, this Court affirms. 

   

Gilmore is currently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution 

(SCI) at Houtzdale.2  On September 29, 2011, Gilmore was sentenced to 3½- to 10-

years  of  incarceration  for  aggravated  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon  (Original 

Sentence).    See  Certified  Record  (C.R.)  at  1.    His  Original  Sentence  maximum 

release date was April 24, 2022.  See id.  On August 22, 2019, the Board reparoled 

Gilmore from his Original Sentence.  See C.R. at 21.  As a condition of his reparole, 

Gilmore consented to the following special condition: 
 

1 The Board mailed its March 24, 2022 order on March 25, 2022.  However, because the 
Board used an invalid institution number in the address, the decision was returned to the Board on 
April 13, 2022.  See Certified Record at 146.  By April 15, 2022 letter, the Board notified Gilmore 
of its error, enclosed the March 24, 2022 decision, and informed Gilmore: “You may use [April 
15, 2022,] for any [] appellate petitions to Commonwealth Court.”  Certified Record at 147.

If  you  are  convicted  of  a  crime  committed  while  on 
parole/reparole,  the  Board  has  the  authority,  after  an 
appropriate hearing, to recommit you to serve the balance 
of the sentence or sentences which you were serving when 
paroled/reparoled,  with  no  credit  for  time  at  liberty  on 
parole. 

C.R. at 22.   

On  November  15,  2019,  Erie  City  police  arrested  Gilmore  for 

Strangulation  -  Applying  Pressure  to  Throat  or  Neck  (F2),  Unlawful  Restraint/ 

Serious Bodily Injury (M1), Simple Assault (M2), and Harassment - Subject Other 

to Physical Contact (S) (New Charges), and placed him in the Erie County Prison.  

See C.R. at 36, 39-48, 66.  Gilmore did not post bail on his New Charges.  See C.R. 

at  70,  104.    That  same  day,  the  Board  issued  a  Warrant  to  Commit  and  Detain 

Gilmore pending disposition of the New Charges.  See C.R. at 35.   

On  November  26,  2019,  the  Board  issued  a  Notice  of  Charges  and 

Hearing, scheduling Gilmore’s detention hearing for December 13, 2019.  See C.R. 

at 36-37.  Gilmore admitted to being arrested on the New Charges and waived his 

right  to  counsel  and  the  detention  hearing.    See  C.R.  at  38,  49-53.    By  decision 

recorded February 21, 2020, the Board detained Gilmore pending disposition of his 

New Charges.  See C.R. at 51-52, 54.   

On March 11, 2021, Gilmore pled guilty to Simple Assault (M2) and 

the remaining New Charges were nolle prossed.  See C.R. at 60, 66, 71.  The Erie 

County Common Pleas Court sentenced Gilmore to 10 months to 23 months and 15 

days of  incarceration,  with  a credit  for  the  483 days he  spent  in  the  Erie  County 

Prison from November 15, 2019 to March 11, 2021.  See id.  The sentencing order 

specified  that  Gilmore’s  confinement  was  “[c]oncurrent  with  .  .  .  [a]ny  other 

sentence [he was] currently serving.”  See C.R. at 66.  Because Gilmore had already 

met his minimum sentence date, he was paroled that day, and was returned from the 

 

 

 

 

2 

Erie  County  Prison  to  state  custody  at  SCI-Smithfield  on  March  17,  2021,  then 

moved to SCI-Houtzdale on April 20, 2021.  See C.R. at 93, 102, 116. 

On May 14, 2021, the Board issued a Notice of Charges and Hearing, 

scheduling  Gilmore’s  parole  revocation  hearing  for  May  25,  2021,  based  on  the 

simple assault conviction.  See C.R. at 55-79.  Gilmore waived his right to a panel 

hearing,  but  requested  counsel,  and  Public  Defender  Steven  Johnston,  Esquire 

(Counsel) was appointed to represent him.  See C.R. at 57-58, 93.   

At the  May 25, 2021  revocation  hearing, Gilmore  acknowledged his 

simple assault conviction, see C.R. at 86-87, 90, 98, and Counsel represented:  

[Counsel:] [] Gilmore would like just to advise the Board, 
in determining his CPB [sic] sentence,[3] he would like the 
Board to consider not only the amount of time that he has 
served toward his [Original S]entence, but also his gainful 
employment  during  his  periods  of  parole.    And  he  also 
would like to advise the [B]oard that the particular --- the 
history with the particular victim in this case, who’s the 
complainant/victim of the underlying simple assault  that 
brings  us  before  the  Board  today,  there  is  a  rather 
checkered  history  with  that  victim.    She  has  in  the  past 
filed  numerous  charges,  several  of  which  have  been 
dropped.  He indicates that there was some indication that 
she may wish to recant portions or elements of her original 
complaint in this case.  In any event, for various reasons, 
he has accepted the guilty plea.  He has entered into the 
guilty  plea  and  does  recognize  that  that  establishes  the 
basis for a CPB [sic] to be imposed, but would ask to be 
recommitted  towards  the  bottom  end  of  the  standard 
guidelines for something on the order of nine months as 
opposed to being recommitted for completion of his entire 
remaining [Original S]entence. 

[Counsel:] [] Gilmore, have I failed to mention anything 
that you wish to address to the Board?  

 

3 It is unclear what Counsel meant by CPB.  Perhaps Counsel meant it to stand for convicted 
parole  backtime  or  maybe  he  said  CPV  (referring  to  a  convicted  parole  violator)  and  the 
stenographer misheard him. 

3 

 

 

 

[] GILMORE: No, sir. 

[Counsel]: Very well.  We have nothing further to present 
to the Board at this time. 

C.R. at 89-90; see also C.R. at 95. 

 

By decision recorded July 8, 2021 (mailed July 16, 2021), the Board 

recommitted Gilmore as a convicted parole violator to serve 12 months of backtime 

on his Original Sentence, without credit for time he spent at liberty on parole because 

he  “committed  a  new  conviction  that  is  the  same  or  similar  to  [his]  original 

offense[,]” and “committed a new offense that was assaultive in nature[.]”  C.R. at 

97;  see  also  C.R.  at  93-96,  98-101,  119-120.    The  Board  recalculated  Gilmore’s 

Original Sentence maximum release date to November 12, 2023.  See C.R. at 119-

120. 

 

On July 30, 2021, Gilmore, pro se, filed a Petition for Administrative 

Review  challenging  the  Board’s  Original  Sentence  maximum  release  date 

recalculation.4    See  C.R.  at  126-127.    On  October  20,  2021,  Gilmore  filed  an 

Administrative  Appeal/Petition  for  Administrative  Review  with  the  Board,5 

claiming that the Board’s recommitment order was void because his “new sentence 

[was] not authorized by a jury” as required by the United States  Constitution and 

United States v. Haymond, 139 S. Ct. 2369 (2019), which he claimed extended jury 

protection to revocation hearings.  C.R. at 129;  see also  C.R. at 130-139.  In the 

attachment appended to Gilmore’s October 20, 2021 appeal, Gilmore referenced that 

 

4 The Board received the appeal on August 6, 2021.  See C.R. at 126. 
5 Exhibit E attached to Gilmore’s October 20, 2021 appeal reflected that, on October 13, 
2021, he filed an Inmate Request  to  SCI  Staff Member seeking  the status  of his  July 30, 2021 
appeal.  See C.R. at 137.  SCI staff responded on October 15, 2021, that since he had not received 
the Board’s decision, he should resubmit it because “[t]he system d[id] not indicate it was ever 
received by Central Office.”  Id.; see also C.R. at 130.  However, the crux of his October 20, 2021 
appeal was his claim that he was entitled to a jury relative to his revocation hearing.  See C.R. at 
129.    Gilmore’s  reference  to  the  Original  Sentence  maximum  date  recalculation  was  in  an 
attachment appended to the October 20, 2021 appeal form.  See C.R. at 130. 

 

4 

he had not received the Board’s response to his July 30, 2021 appeal and again asked 

why the Board extended his Original Sentence maximum release date.  See C.R. at 

130. 

 

On March 24, 2022, the Board affirmed its decision recorded July 8, 

2021  (mailed  July  16,  2021)  as  to  Gilmore’s  Original  Sentence  maximum  date 

recalculation, see C.R. at 140-142, and declared: “[The a]dditional correspondence 

postmarked October 20, 2021[,] need not be considered, pursuant to [Section 73.1 

of]  the  Board’s  [R]egulation[s,] 37 Pa. Code  § 73.1  [(relating to untimely  appeal 

filings)].”6  C.R. at 140.  Gilmore timely appealed to this Court.7 

  

In his Petition for Review filed in this Court, Gilmore challenged the 

Board’s March 24, 2022 decision on the basis that the Board’s recalculation of his 

Original Sentence maximum release date was not supported by substantial evidence, 

and that the Board’s revocation decision was void because he was not afforded the 

protection of an impartial jury of his peers as part of the revocation process.  See 

Petition for Review at 13.  However, in the Statement of Questions Involved and 

Argument portions of  his brief to this Court,  Gilmore  only  argues that the Board 

violated the  United  States  Constitution  and  Haymond  by  imposing  a new,  higher 

maximum  prison  term  based  on  a  “nonjury/non-beyond  a  reasonable  doubt” 

revocation hearing.  Gilmore Br. at 11; see also Gilmore Br. at 1-10, 12-13.  The 

Board retorts that Gilmore waived his jury trial challenge because he did not raise 

any such objection at his revocation hearing, nor in his timely July 30, 2021 appeal 

from the Board’s decision recorded July 8, 2021 (mailed July 16, 2021). 

 

6 The Board mailed the decision to Gilmore on April 15, 2022.   
7 “This Court’s ‘review over actions of the Board is limited to determining whether the 
decision  was  supported  by  substantial  evidence,  whether  an  error  of  law  occurred  or  whether 
constitutional rights were violated.’  Ramos v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. [&] Parole, 954 A.2d 107, 109 n.1 
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2008).”  Brown v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole, 184 A.3d 1021, 1023 n.5 (Pa. Cmwlth. 
2017).

Section 73.1 of the Board’s Regulations mandates that administrative 

appeals and petitions for administrative review must be filed within 30 days of the 

mailing date of the Board’s determination, and the Board  “will not . . . receive[]” 

appeals that are not timely filed.  37 Pa. Code § 73.1(a)(3), (b)(3).  This Regulation 

is based on the fact that “the timeliness of an appeal is jurisdictional, [and] the Board 

[i]s without authority to consider” late-filed appeals.  Ayers v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. & 

Parole, 565 A.2d 1257, 1258 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1989); see also Pometti v. Pa. Bd. of 

Prob. & Parole, 705 A.2d 953, 955 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1998) (“[T]he Board does not have 

the jurisdiction to hear an untimely filed appeal.”). 

Moreover,  Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  1551(a) 

specifies:  “Only  questions  raised  before  the  government  unit  shall  be  heard  or 

considered” on appeal.  Pa.R.A.P. 1551(a).  “The law is well settled that issues not 

raised before the Board either at the revocation hearing or in the petitioner’s [timely] 

administrative  appeal  are  waived  and  cannot  be  considered  for  the  first  time  on 

appeal.”   Chesson v.  Pa. Bd.  of Prob.  & Parole, 47 A.3d 875, 878 (Pa.  Cmwlth. 

2012); see also Mesko v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole, 245 A.3d 1174, 1179-80 (Pa. 

Cmwlth.  2021)  (“It  is  well  settled  that  ‘issues  not  raised  by  a  [convicted  parole 

violator]  before  the  [B]oard  in  a  [timely]  administrative  appeal  are  waived  for 

purposes  of  appellate  review  by  this  [C]ourt.’    McCaskill  v.  Pa.  Bd.  of  Prob.  & 

Parole, . . . 631 A.2d 1092, 1094-95 ([Pa. Cmwlth.] 1993).”). 

  

 

Gilmore did not raise his jury challenge at the May 25, 2021 revocation 

hearing, nor in his July 30, 2021 appeal from the Board’s decision recorded July 8, 

2021 (mailed July 16, 2021) that was timely filed.8  Although Gilmore raised that 

issue in his October 20, 2021 appeal, because that appeal was not filed within 30 

 

8 Moreover, the record offers no basis on which this Court could hold that Gilmore’s jury 
issue was subsumed in the timely appeal of his  Original Sentence maximum date recalculation 
issue. 

 

6 

days of the mailing date of the Board’s decision recorded July 8, 2021 (mailed July 

16, 2021), the Board properly rejected the appeal as untimely and refused to consider 

the jury issue in its March 24, 2022 determination.  See C.R. at 140.  Even if Gilmore 

filed the October 20, 2021 appeal believing that the Board may not have received 

his July 30, 2021 appeal, his failure to raise the jury issue to the Board in the first 

instance  was  fatal.    Accordingly,  there  is  nothing  remaining  before  this  Court  to 

address.9    

Based on the foregoing, this Court affirms the Board’s order. 

 

9 Because Gilmore clearly limited his appeal to this Court to his jury challenge, he waived 
the opportunity for this Court to review any claim that the Board erred by affirming its Original 
Sentence  maximum  date  recalculation.    Although  Gilmore  raised  both  the  Original  Sentence 
maximum  release  date  recalculation  and  jury  challenges  in  his  Petition  for  Review,  he  did  not 
reference his Original Sentence maximum release date recalculation in his brief to this Court, let 
alone list it among his Statement of Questions Involved or discuss it in his Argument.  See Mandler 
v. Commonwealth, 247 A.3d 104 (Pa. Cmwlth.), aff’d, 263 A.3d 551 (Pa. 2021) (Issues not raised 
in a party’s statement of questions involved and argument sections of his brief are waived.). 

Even if the issue of recalculation were properly before this Court, this Court would affirm 
the Board’s order.  In his initial administrative remedies form, Gilmore argued that the Board erred 
in crediting the amount of backtime owed on his Original Sentence and recalculating his Original 
Sentence maximum release date.  Section 6138(a)(2) of Prisons and Parole Code (Code) authorizes 
the Board to recommit CPVs to serve the remainder of the term they would have been required to 
serve, which requires the Board to recalculate a sentence.  See 61 Pa.C.S. § 6138(a)(2).  At the 
time  Gilmore  was  paroled  from  his  Original  Sentence  on  August  22,  2019,  he  had  976  days 
remaining on his Original Sentence.  The Board denied Gilmore credit for time spent at liberty on 
parole for reasons relating to his new conviction and supervision history.  See C.R. at 131.  Because 
Gilmore was denied time spent at liberty on parole, he owed 976 days on his Original Sentence.  
Thus,  this  Court  would  conclude  that  the  Board  properly  recalculated  his  Original  Sentence 
maximum release date.   

Additionally, Section 6138(a)(5) of the Code provides that a CPV who is released from an 
SCI and receives a new sentence to be served in a county facility must serve the new sentence first.  
See 61 Pa.C.S. § 6138(a)(5).  Here, Gilmore became available to serve his Original Sentence on 
March 11, 2021, when he was paroled from his Erie County sentence.  Adding 976 days to March 
11,  2021,  yields  a  new  Original  Sentence  maximum  release  date  of  November  12,  2023.  
Accordingly,  this  Court  would  conclude  that  the  Board  had  properly  recalculated  Gilmore’s 
Original Sentence maximum release date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
