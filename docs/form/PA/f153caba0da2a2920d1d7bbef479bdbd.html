11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

Pennsylvania's Supreme Court is the oldest in the nation, predating the United States Supreme
Court by 67 years.  In matters of law, the state Supreme Court is Pennsylvania's  court of last
resort.  In matters of administration, the Court's seven Justices are responsible  for the effective
management  of  the  Commonwealth's  Unified  Judicial  System,  including  the  intermediate
appellate courts, the Courts of Common Pleas, the magisterial  district judge courts and related
minor  courts, and all staff who contribute to the system's administration.  Justices are elected
to  10-year  terms,  with  the  Chief  Justice  being  the  member  having  the  longest  continuous
service among the seven.

This appropriation provides funding for the salaries and benefits of the Supreme Court Justices,
their staff and the staff of the prothonotary offices in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia,
in addition to necessary  operating expenses  and fixed assets.  This  budget request reflects an
estimate of the expenses required for the Supreme  Court to carry out the programs  mandated
under the laws of the Commonwealth and to give the Court the ability to manage the increasing
workload of the entire judicial system.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  Art.V, Sec. 2, PA Constitution

1011. PROGRAM STATEMENT

In accordance with the Pennsylvania  Constitution and the provisions  of the Rules  of Judicial
Administration 301 and 302, the Judicial Council of Pennsylvania serves at the Chief Justice’s
discretion as an advisory body to assist the Court in managing  the Commonwealth’s Unified
Judicial System.  The appropriation funds selected program initiatives.

The Judicial Council has a two-pronged advisory role in making recommendations on matters
referred to it  by the Court and, from time  to time,  on  its own initiative.   Its work has  been
facilitated through the following committees:  Statewide Rules, Statewide Unification, Budget, 
Judicial Education, Judicial Safety and Preparedness, and Strategic Planning.

Notable accomplishments  by the Judicial Council are the publication of a continuing education
curriculum  for  state  trial  judges,  which  was  a  joint  initiative  of  the  Council's  Education
Committee  and  AOPC's  Judicial  Education  Department;  and  the  initiation  of  an  ongoing
security program  improving  the safety of court facilities across  the Commonwealth. Funding
from this appropriation  is supporting the seven-member  task force implemented in July 2017
by the Supreme  Court to evaluate  and recommend  improvements  to the investigating  grand
jury system.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The  24-member  Interbranch  Commission  for  Gender,  Racial  and  Ethnic  Fairness  was 
established in January 2005 by the three branches of state government. Its membership  consists 
of  appointments  from  the  majority  and minority   parties  of  the  House  and Senate,  t he 
Governor’s Office, and the Supreme Court. The Commission’s  work is conducted through six 
committees, summarized below.

Criminal  Justice  Committee:  Since  submitting  its  “Memorandum  on  Indigent  Defense 
Reform  in  Pennsylvania”  (which  includes  juvenile  defense  reform),  the  Committee  has 
convened several meetings with relevant stakeholders and key legislators  to secure bipartisan 
support  for  the  recommended  reforms.    Education continues  for  all  three  branches  of  the 
government and the public on the reforms recommended in the 2018 study of racial, ethnic and 
socio-economic  disparities in the death penalty system. A second, broader phase of the study 
is currently  underway. The  Committee also continues to promote the reform  of existing cash 
bail  and legal  financial  obligation  procedures  that result  in the unwarranted incarceration  of 
indigent individuals. Specifically,  this year, the Committee provided written testimony to the 
Board of Pardons opposing its new policy prohibiting clemency hearings for inmates who owe 
outstanding  costs  and  fees  to  the  courts,  and  has  submitted  formal  comments  and 
recommendations in connection with an initiative to update Allegheny County’s Rules of Court 
for Bail, Probation and Incarceration. The Committee is also working on a bill requiring police 
departments to either contract with a mental health practitioner or train in-house personnel  to 
accompany officers on calls involving individuals experiencing mental health crises.

Jury  Service  Committee:  In  November  2021,  the  Committee  published  and distributed a 
pamphlet designed to educate individuals who speak English as a second language about jury 
service  and the level of English language proficiency needed to serve on a jury. As part of its 
efforts to increase juror  diversity,  and to  assess  the  impact  of the  districts’  increased  use  of 
the  statewide juror  list,  the  Committee  sent  a  juror  demographic  survey  to  each  district 
court  administrator,  inquiring  whether they collect  juror  demographic  data and whether the 
data has yielded any information  about the diversity of their  juries.  The  Committee  has also 
submitted a  letter  in  support of legislation  that would reduce the range of criminal  offenses 
that currently d isqualify former offenders from jury service for life.

 14Equal Opportunity  and Diversity  Committee:  In connection  with its effort to educate the 
public  and  court  employees  about  the  UJS  Policy  on  Non-Discrimination  and  EEO,  the 
Committee is currently designing a one-page summary  of the policy and complaint process to 
distribute to judges, court personnel,  attorneys, and court users throughout Pennsylvania. The 
Committee also continues to monitor and offer comment on the various proposed versions  of 
new PA Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(g), prohibiting attorneys from knowingly engaging 
in discriminatory  conduct in the practice of law. In addition, the Committee is  distributing to 
relevant  stakeholders  the  finalized  Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Evidence  413,  which  limits  the 
admissibility  of  one’s  immigration  status  into  evidence.    The  new  Rule  was  initially 
recommended to the Supreme  Court by the Committee.   The  Committee has  also  convened 
additional meetings  of its Implicit Bias  in Legal Education Work Group, which is  drafting a 
multi-faceted  implicit  bias  training  program  for  law  schools  based  on  a  range  of  model 
programs  around  the  country.  The  Committee  additionally produced and distributed to  bar 
association  committees  and  other  groups  a  one-page  summary  of  Pennsylvania  attorney 
demographic data.  

Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victims Committee: The Committee is collaborating 
with  and  disseminating  information  about  an  Anti-Human  Trafficking  Initiative,  which 
provides pro bono civil  court representation to victims  of human trafficking. The Committee 
has  also  worked  on  and  is  currently  advocating  for  a  pending  bill  that  would  require  the 
Department  of  Health  to  launch  a  statewide  rape  kit  tracking  system.  In  addition,  the 
Committee  is  actively  pursuing  opportunities  to  educate  juvenile  service  providers,  law 
enforcement,  and the  courts  about  a  rule  clarification  that it  sought  and obtained  from  the 
Interstate Commission  for  Juveniles  in  2020. As  clarified,  the  rule  permits  juvenile  human 
trafficking victims who are not under supervision  in their home states to remain in the state in 
which they were found, rather than be involuntarily  returned to their home state.  

L.G.B.T.Q. Rights  Committee:  The  Committee  recently  submitted  letters  to  the  relevant
legislative  committees  in  support of pending legislation  to amend the  Pennsylvania  Human
Relations  Act  to  extend  non-discrimination  protections  for  LGBTQ  individuals.  The
Committee also convened several  meetings  of its Work  Group for LGBTQ Youth in Out-of-
Home Placements, which it established to secure non-discrimination  protections for LGBTQ
youth  and families  within  the  state  foster  care  system.  The  work  group  has  compiled  and
reviewed the relevant  portions of the Pennsylvania  Code, model regulations  implemented  in
other states, and best practices in place in  Allegheny County, and will approach the relevant
authorities with suggested regulatory changes.

Interpreter  Services  Committee:  Since  the passage  of Act 172, which mandates the use of 
certified or otherwise qualified interpreters in most court and administrative proceedings, the 
Committee  has  been  working  with  the  AOPC’s  Language  Access  Coordinator  to  ensure 
compliance  with the Act’s requirements.  The  Committee submitted formal  comments  to the 
AOPC’s recently proposed amendments to the regulations,  which among other things, would 

15ensure that interpreters are sufficiently compensated for their work both on-site and remotely. 
The amended regulations,  effective January 1, 2022, incorporated several of the Committee’s 
proposed changes.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

This  appropriation  funds  the  eight  Supreme  Court  standing  rules  committees:  Criminal
Procedural  Rules,  Civil  Procedural  Rules,  Domestic  Relations  Procedural  Rules,  Juvenile
Court Procedural Rules, Appellate Court Procedural Rules, Orphans’ Court Procedural Rules,
Committee on Rules of Evidence, and Minor Court Rules.

The rules  committees assist the Supreme Court in fulfilling  its constitutional responsibility  to
prescribe  general  rules  governing  court  proceedings  in  Pennsylvania’s  Unified  Judicial
System.   Acting as  advisory bodies, the rules  committees  study and recommend  procedural
and evidentiary  rules  to  the Court.    In  executing  this  role,  the committees  coordinate  with
members  of  the  bench,  bar,  public,  and  the  legislative  and  executive  branches  to  receive
information,  comments,  and  suggestions  regarding  the  rules  and  rule  proposals.    The
committees also monitor recent legislation and court opinions to maintain rules that are current
with the Commonwealth’s developing law.

Another committee function is rules  drafting.  During this process,  the committee may direct
staff to investigate and prepare  proposed changes,  additions, or  deletions to the rules.   After
consideration  by  the  full  committee,  which  may  or  may  not  have  been  preceded  by  a
subcommittee review, a proposed recommendation proceeds in accordance with Pennsylvania
Rule  of  Judicial  Administration  103.    Under  Rule  103,  a  proposed  recommendation  is
published  in  the  Pennsylvania  Bulletin  and  other  legal  publications  for  public  comment.
Subsequently,  the  committee  reviews  the public  comments  received  and, as  necessary,  the
committee  may  modify the proposal  before submitting  to the Court a final  recommendation
for its consideration.

In aggregate,  the eight  rules  committees  have  approximately  100  members  serving  without
compensation  and  supported  by  five  attorneys  and  two  administrative  staff.    The  rules
committees  meet  several  times  a  year,  generally  for  one-to-two  day  meetings.    Some
committees  use  standing or  ad  hoc  subcommittees,  which  meet  at  other  times  to  work  on
specific  issues.    In Fiscal  Year  2021-22,  the  various  rules  committees  will  have  convened

 19approximately  28 times  at either  the Pennsylvania  Judicial  Center or  by videoconferencing.  
During 2021 the rules  committees extensively used videoconferencing due to COVID and its 
associated restrictions.   

The work of the rules committees in 2021 has included:1 

• The  Juvenile  Court Procedural Rules Committee  published proposed rule  changes on
the following topics: 1)  extracting the rules  of construction from the Pennsylvania Rules
of  Juvenile  Court  Procedure  and  placing  them  in  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Judicial
Administration, including corollary  amendments to the various bodies of rules to reference
the newly placed rules of construction; (2) permitting the ongoing use of videoconferencing
and other electronic  communications  (Advanced Communication  Technology)  in various
proceedings;  and  (3)  providing  for  statewide  judicial  access  to  limited  information

Start-up costs for one new senior judge and one vacant judge - $276,000

The  Pennsylvania  General  Assembly  established the Superior  Court in 1895 to hear appeals
from certain  decisions  of the Commonwealth’s  Courts of Common  Pleas.  Since the Court’s
inception, the General Assembly has periodically  expanded the Superior  Court’s jurisdiction,
and  today  it  decides  appeals  touching  almost  every  aspect  of  life  and  commerce  in  the
Commonwealth. These  appeals  include, among others, family  matters such  as child custody,
visitation, adoption, divorce, and support; criminal  cases; matters concerning wills and estates;
property  disputes;  and  cases  involving  damages  for  breach  of  contract  or  personal  injury.
Superior  Court  judges  also  hear  applications  made  by  the  Attorney  General  and  district
attorneys under the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance  Control Act. The Superior Court
is very often the final arbiter  of legal  disputes in Pennsylvania.  Although the Supreme  Court
may grant a petition for an appeal from a decision of the Superior  Court, in the vast majority
of cases the Court denies such petitions.

The  Superior Court is comprised of 15 commissioned  judges. Currently, there are only three
senior  judges assisting  in  the work of the court.  Except for cases  in  which  the court orders
consideration by an en banc panel of nine judges, the court sits in three-judge panels, hearing
oral arguments an average of three times per month throughout the Commonwealth.

Each year, the Superior Court receives approximately 8,000 appeals and decides over 5,000 on
the merits. The Court also receives close to 18,000 motions per year. According to the National 
Center  for  State Courts, the  Superior  Court  is  the busiest  intermediate  appellate  court,  per
judge, in the nation. Specifically,  in calendar year 2021, the Superior  Court concluded 5,857
appeals.  To meet this rigorous  workload of the Court, each Judge had to author, on average,
190 decisions.

 28Overall,  this  appropriation  provides  funding  for  salaries  and  benefits  for  judges  and  staff, 
annuitant  benefits,  operating  expenses,  and  fixed  assets  necessary  for  judicial  and 
administrative operations. With the exception of approximately $155,000 received annually by 
the court in filing fees, and the use in recent years of augmentations to supplement limited state 
funding, the Superior  Court is entirely dependent upon this appropriation to provide the funds 
necessary to carry out its constitutional mandate. Funding of this budget request is essential to 
continue the efficient and effective operation of the court.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The  Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania  came  into existence January  1, 1970, created by
the  Pennsylvania  Constitution  of  1968.    The  court  hears  appeals  from  county  Courts  of
Common  Pleas  and state administrative  agencies.   From  county courts,  the Commonwealth
Court  hears  appeals  in  matters  involving  zoning,  taxation,  civil  service,  negligence  cases
involving  state  and  local  government,  and  eminent  domain,  among  others.    From  state
administrative  agencies, 
in  matters  involving  workers’  and
unemployment  compensation,  environmental  issues,  welfare  claims,  public  utility  rate
disputes, and taxation, among others.  In addition, the court acts as a trial court in certain types
of cases  where  the  Commonwealth  is  a  party,  including  actions  in  equity,  mandamus,  and
declaratory  judgment,  as  well  as  hearing  cases  arising  under the  Election  Code in  both its
original  and  appellate  jurisdiction.    The  court  also  actively  supervises  insolvent  insurance
company  estates in various  stages  of rehabilitation  or liquidation.   These  matters, which  are
akin  to bankruptcy  proceedings,  involve  complex,  protracted litigation,  and present  unique
case management challenges  requiring  significant judicial and staff resources.

the  court  hears  appeals 

The Court’s caseload remained lower than usual again in 2021 because of the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic  and decreased activity  in the courts  of common  pleas  and state administrative
agencies, which resulted in fewer appeals.  However, the court continued to handle – in a very
expedited manner – considerable original  jurisdiction litigation involving issues related to the
pandemic and ongoing election-related disputes.  Overall, 2,691 new actions were filed in the
court in calendar year 2021.  Of these, 493 were new original  jurisdiction cases, 350 of which
were filed by prisoners.    In the court’s  appellate  jurisdiction,  752 new agency  appeals  were
filed  in  2021,  including  230  unemployment  compensation  appeals  and  231  workers’
compensation appeals, among other categories.   In other major appellate categories,  the court
received 711 new appeals from the courts of common pleas, and 702 new tax appeals from the
board of finance and revenue.

 36In 2021 the Commonwealth Court disposed of 2,316  cases.  The  court’s  mediation program 
continued to be successful in  2021: 129 cases  were referred to mediation, and 69 cases were 
resolved, eliminating  the need for further litigation.

#Detail not provided by Governor’s Office of the Budget. 

^Fiscal Year 2021-22 – Personnel and Operating: Other Funds include augmenting revenues of 
$4,652 in Act 49 of 2009 revenues. 

^^Fiscal Year 2022-23 – Personnel and Operating: Other Funds include augmenting revenues of 
$4,652 in anticipated Act 49 of 2009 revenues. This budget is predicated on the expectation that the 
Act 49 sunset date will be extended beyond June 30, 2022. 

The federal funds shown each year in this presentation consist primarily  of funds under Title 
IV-B and IV-E of the Social  Security  Act from the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services,  Administration  on  Children,  Youth  and  Families  for  the  Court  Improvement 
Program  (CIP)  involving  the  dependency courts.    Each  year  also  includes  federal  funds 
provided by  the  Pennsylvania  Commission  on  Crime  and  Delinquency  (PCCD)  from  the 
STOP Violence  Against Women  grant program  to provide training  and technical assistance 
to Pennsylvania’s  judiciary.    Fiscal  Year  2021-22 and Fiscal  Year  2022-23 include  federal 
grant funds for Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) Strategic Planning.  This  grant will be used 
for training. Team-focused  training can help  team members  develop common  language and 
approaches  to challenges.  It is  anticipated that after holding several  regional  trainings  or  a 
VTC Summit addressing veteran-specific issues,  that courts will not only feel better prepared 
to deal with such issues,  but that they will establish  or revise their treatment court guidelines 
to be inclusive of all issues facing veteran participants.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

Pennsylvania’s Constitutional Convention of 1967-68 created a Unified Judicial System (UJS)
and formalized the Supreme Court’s authority to supervise  all of the Commonwealth’s courts.
That Constitution also  created the position  of Court Administrator of Pennsylvania,  with the
responsibility of leading the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) in assisting
the Supreme Court to carry out its supervisory  and administrative roles.

The  AOPC provides services  for jurists,  staff and the citizens of the Commonwealth.  Those
duties include providing statewide support in the areas of technology, communications, human
resources,  payroll,  budgeting  and  accounting,  law,  intergovernmental  relations,  court
programs, research  and education.

Funding for AOPC operations comes mainly from appropriated state funds, and also from fee
funding  and  a  small  amount  of  federal  funds.    Funding  for  its  information  technology
operations—known as the Judicial Computer System (JCS)—is provided by appropriations of
restricted receipts contained within the JCS Augmentation Account.  More information can be
found under the Statewide Judicial Computer System tab later in this book.

Highlights of UJS initiatives in which the AOPC has been involved over the past year include
the following:

• Held  the  first  ever  Veterans  Treatment  Court  Virtual  Summit  in  conjunction  with
Justice for Vets.  This event was open to all problem-solving  court teams and criminal
justice  professionals  who  support  justice-involved  veterans.    Some  of  the  topics
presented on included military  culture,  PTSD, traumatic brain  injury,  military  sexual
trauma,  effective  clinical  interventions  for  the  justice-involved  population,  and  the
mentor/mentee relationship.

• Presented two virtual “town hall” sessions  on the prevention of and responses  to elder
abuse and financial exploitation that were subsequently broadcast on the Pennsylvania
Cable Network.

• Developed  and  presented 

the  Monitoring  Guardianships  Cases: 

the
Guardianship Tracking System (GTS) Can Do for You course to judges and the courses
Reviewing  the  Inventory  and  Report  of  Guardian  of  the  Estate  and  Reviewing  the
Report of Guardian of the Person to court staff and orphans’  court clerks  to assist the
courts with reviewing  annual  guardianship  reports and addressing flags raised by the
GTS.

  What 

 44• Translated  a  number  of  important  court  forms  into  the  top  languages  for  which
interpreters  are  most  frequently  requested,  including  landlord/tenant, expungement,
language access, and juvenile delinquency forms which are posted to the UJS website.
Funding provided from the State Justice Institute.

• Developed Physical  Security  Self-Assessment instruments  for Common  Pleas  Courts

per RJA 1954.

• As of December  2021,  42 million  cases  were  sealed  across  the  MDJS and CPCMS
under the auspices of the Clean Slate law. This  accounts for 65% of the entire caseload
of these systems.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

This  appropriation  funds the  centralized  costs  to  operate  the Judicial  Center  in  the  capitol
complex.  This  budget request provides full-year funding for 12 staff positions (including one
new position) and related operating costs required to support this facility.

The  majority  of centralized operating  costs consist  of janitorial,  telephone and data circuits,
equipment maintenance,  facilities  management,  and mail  room expenses  required for central
support of building occupants and building operations of the Judicial Center.  Augmentations
of $354,000 are expected to be collected from tenants to offset on-going operating costs.

The  Judicial  Center  continues  to  be an  example  of intergovernmental  cooperation  with  the
move  of the grand jury  courtroom  from Strawberry  Square  to the sixth  floor of the Judicial
Center.  In addition, meeting rooms within the Judicial Center are routinely offered to and used
by executive and legislative  branch agencies.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

This  appropriation  funds  the  salaries,  benefits  and  related  expenses  of  the  district  court
administrative positions  transitioned to state service  January  1, 2000 in accordance with Act
12 of 1999 and those created subsequently.  Act 12 authorized those transfers as a means  of
developing  a  solid  management  infrastructure  between  the  state  and  district  courts  as
components of the overall  Unified Judicial  System.  Judicial  district (county)  administrative
positions have been held steady for some years, but requests to increase funding to fulfill long-
standing staff needs are under consideration.  As a result, this budget request provides funding
for 12 new positions for a total complement  of 208, an increase  of 33, or 19%,  over the 175
transitioned to the Unified Judicial System in 2000.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The  funding provided by  this  appropriation  enables  the  provision  of an  ongoing  education
program  to  allow  Judiciary  staff to participate  in  various  education  forums  to further  their
professional competence.  This includes attendance at seminars, professional conferences, and
other  venues  as  appropriate.    The  education  program  is  designed  to  further  develop  and
strengthen the skills  of both management and staff.

56This  budget request provides for continued professional  education of state-level  district court 
staff, presented in various venues, including regional settings and webinars.  Webinars  enable 
participants  to  attend at  no  cost  to  the  counties  and eliminat e  AOPC’s cost  to  present  the 
seminars  on-site  in  regional se ttings.   The  webinars  are supplemente d  by  a  special  session 
developed for and offered each spring in Harrisburg  to new court staff.  An optional course 
open to all  district court staff, both state-level  and county-level,  is also  traditionally offered 
each year. 

Education programs  are also made available  to other Judiciary staff through private providers 
so that offerings may be tailored to meet individual needs.  Group training sessions  have also 
traditionally  been used as needed to address specific  skills  for non-management  staff.  This 
program  of education is  designed to advance the contemporary  professional  and managerial 
skills  of  employees  throughout the  Judiciary,  and to  reduce  the  potential  for  litigation  for 
liability  which  would accrue  to  the  employer  as  a  result  of  the  professional  actions  of  its 
employees.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania adopted continuing education requirements on December
9,  2016,  effective January  1,  2017,  for  all  state trial  and appellate  court  judges.  The  order
required each judge to earn annually three hours of judicial ethics education and nine hours of
substantive continuing education in judicial practice and related areas.

On February  7,  2020,  the Supreme  Court adopted Rules  for Continuing  Judicial  Education
(CJE), effective March 7, 2020.  The  rules  replaced the Court’s Order of December  9, 2016.
While  the new rules  provided structure to the CJE requirements  established in the December
2016  order,  they  made  only  minor  changes  to  the  infrastructure  and mandates  established
thereunder.  Under the CJE Rules, Pennsylvania’s  trial and appellate court judges must earn a
minimum  of 12  hours of continuing  judicial  education annually,  three of which  much be  in
judicial  ethics.   Four  of the annual  credits must be  earned through courses  developed by or
under the supervision  of the AOPC Judicial  Education Department.  A 12-member  Board of
Judges  meets  quarterly,  and  oversees  the  implementation  of  the  rules,  including  both
compliance and the quality of programs offered.  The Board is supported by the AOPC Judicial 
Education Department.  It reports to the Supreme  Court annually, or whenever directed to do
so.

Since the onset of the pandemic, and by necessity,  CJE opportunities provided by accredited
and  non-accredited  providers  alike  have  been  delivered  nearly  exclusively  by  remote
technology.  To  facilitate  credit  accumulation,  the  Board  suspended  the  four  credit  hour
limitation on approved distance education for both the 2020 and the 2021 compliance periods.
Under  this  accommodation,  judges  could  satisfy  their  CJE  obligations  by  earning  an
unrestricted number of credit hours by participating in accredited distance education programs
that meet the Board’s interactive and technical  requirements.   Judges may carry forward into
2023 CJE credits earned during 2022, irrespective  of whether the program was delivered live
or by remote technology.

 60This  appropriation provides the funding for the program of professional continuing education 
for judges subject to the new mandatory education requirements.   This  program is  conducted 
through conferences and seminars  presented in both statewide and in regional  settings under 
the auspices  of AOPC's Judicial  Education Department.  The  department works closely  with 
the Pennsylvania  Conference of State Trial  Judges and other providers  to develop a state-of-
the-art curriculum  that includes timely and relevant continuing education courses presented to 
judges throughout the state. 

This  appropriation  funds conferences,  seminars,  and  educational  programs  as  well  as  two 
professional  educators and an  education specialist  to plan,  implement  and support  the vital 
continuing education program for jurists. 

It also funds orientation programs  offered biennially for newly-elected common pleas judges, 
informational  mailings,  and  records  maintenance.    These  programs  are  supplemented  by 
specialized  symposia  designed for specific  judicial  audiences,  such  as  annual  meetings  for 
president  judges  and  district  court  administrators  to  discuss  issues  pertinent  to  their 
responsibilities.    

Funding  requested  in  this  appropriation  will  allow  increased  course  offerings  and judicial 
participation, and costs associated with tracking and reporting compliance  with the education 
requirements.   It also funds the Continuing Judicial  Education Board of Judges noted above, 
who  are  charged  with,  inter  alia,  making  accreditation  decisions,  granting  waivers  and 
deferrals, and hearing non-compliance  appeals.

63Problem-solving courts continue to be seen as an effective means of rehabilitating individuals 
charged with criminal behavior stemming from problems better treated outside the traditional 
punitive corrections process. We believe these courts are both cost-effective and beneficial in 
providing meaningful help to people to address behavior that contributes to criminality. 

n 2005, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court endorsed the drug court model for judicial districts 
throughout the Commonwealth and sanctioned the nationally-recognized template which sets 
forth a protocol for their operation, and applied it to the operation of problem-solving courts 
in general. The Court's endorsement included the creation of performance standards to guide 
the operation and measurement of the efficacy of all problem-solving courts, and served as an 
impetus to their creation. 

he increased number of these courts over recent years increases the ability to deliver effective 
and efficient programs in response to local needs and desires to benefit court management and 
constituents.  As  of  January  2022,  there  were  129  problem-solving  courts  in  operation  in 
Pennsylvania,  including  drug  courts,  mental  health  courts,  domestic  violence  courts,  and 
veterans courts which address specific problems that contribute to criminal behavior, and their 
numbers continue to grow. Although there are differences in structure and operation among 
the  various  courts,  all  follow  the  foundation  provided  by  the  national  drug  court  model  in 
format and content. The AOPC provides education, training and support for these programs 
and assists in the coordination of related activities. 

his appropriation provides the resources used to assist counties in managing these courts in 
accordance with nationally-recognized standards for best practices. Such assistance takes the 
form of staff training, monitoring program performance, and costs associated with maintaining 
the  case  management  system  that  provides  data on  program  performance.  This  Fiscal  Year 
2022-23 budget request includes funding to support the regional drug court created to serve 
three rural counties, grant funding to counties to implement new problem-solving courts, and 
discretionary grants designed to support program functions of existing problem-solving courts.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The  goal of the Unified Judicial System's Security Program  is  to make  every court facility a
safe place for the general  public, litigants and their families,  jurors,  witnesses, and victims  of
crime to conduct their business.

Current year funding provides reimbursements to counties for the purchase of essential security 
equipment  including  duress alarms,  ballistic  shielding  for benches  and transaction  counters,
magnetics  locks for courtroom  doors, security lighting,  prisoner  anchoring  devices, intrusion
alarms,  CCTV, solid  core  doors, access  control  locks  for staff areas,  and intrusion  resistant
window film.

The  Fiscal  Year  2022-23 request continues  to build upon the past years’  work of enhancing
physical security and safety features for common pleas and magisterial  district courts in order
to mitigate and respond to the spectrum of risks  posed by natural and man-made emergencies
(e.g.,  active  shooter/assailants,  mass  casualty  events).    In  2021,  there  were  361  incidents
reported at common  pleas  courts,  and 439 at magisterial  district courts, for a record total of
800, an increase  of nearly 10% from the previous record of 732 incidents reported in 2019.

The  request  also  provides  for  the  continued  funding of  five  staff to  manage  the  incidents
reported  to  the  Pennsylvania  Judicial  Incident  Reporting  System  (PJIRS),  the  increased
demands for physical security assessments at common pleas and magisterial district courts, the
need for  development of expanded exportable  security  training  programs,  and the  need for
more comprehensive  protection services  for members  of the judiciary while at key conference
events.

JCS is funded primarily from a dedicated funding stream consisting of restricted revenues.  Act 
64 of 1987 instituted this funding mechanism based on future increases in fine collections and 
court costs resulting  from automated court systems.  The funding was later supplemented by 

71filing fees created by Act 59 of 1990, as amended by Act 122 of 2002.  Revenue collections 
are deposited into a restricted revenue account within the state Treasury, from which annual 
appropriations are made to JCS.  (42 Pa.C.S.A. Sec. 3734) 

Available  revenues  have fallen  56%,  or $36.7 million  over  the past 13 years;  nearly  half of 
which is the result of the enactment of Act 42 of 2018 which diverts the first $15 million  of 
Act 64 restricted revenues  earmarked for JCS to the School Safety and Security Fund.  As a 
result, over 100 staff and contractor positions have been eliminated, for annual operating cost 
reductions of $16 million.   Staff reductions have resulted in diminished services  to end-users 
including state and local agencies which rely on these systems. 

Act 24 of 2021 provided a one-year pause in the annual diversion of Act 64 restricted revenues. 
However,  in  order  for the  AOPC/IT department to  maintain  existing  systems  and continue 
providing  services  to  the  many  agencies  that  rely  on  the  AOPC/IT  department,  sufficient 
funding must be  provided.   Budget projections  indicate that unless  the pause  in  the  annual 
diversion of Act 64 funds is made permanent, the account balance will be depleted by the end 
of Fiscal  Year 2023-24. 

Other revenues,  estimated at $4.485  million  in  Fiscal  Year 2022-23,  are  designed to offset 
costs  of specific  JCS  functions and include  online  payment fees,  expungement  fees,  public 
access  fees  levied  on  nongovernmental  users  of  information  captured  by  the  Magisterial 
District Judge System (MDJS), and Medicare D subsidies.  Restricted revenues for the Jen and 
Dave program  derived from fees established by Act 119 of 1996 will be available  to support 
costs of these statutorily-required operations.   

Prior-year  encumbrances  of approximately  $4.5  million  are  available  and are  being  used to 
offset specific contract costs.

7211.  PROGRAM STATEMENT

Pennsylvania continues to be a national leader in judicial computerization.  The IT department
within AOPC has been recognized for making court information significantly more accessible,
improving  collection  of  fines,  fees,  costs  and  restitution,  and  administrative  efficiencies
throughout the court system.

Funded by revenues derived from court costs, filing fees and designated fines, rather than tax
dollars,  AOPC’s  IT  department creates,  maintains  and updates statewide case  management
systems  for  all  three  levels  of  Pennsylvania’s  courts  (Appellate,  Common  Pleas  and
Magisterial  District courts).    Local  court  officials  are  able  to access  court  case  information
about parties related to cases anywhere in the state.  Most importantly, the systems are linked,
allowing millions  of cases to be shared as each case moves through the court system.

Access to Data

•

•

•

•

2.15 million cases were docketed in 2021 by utilizing our three case management systems
– the  MDJS,  the  Common  Pleas  Court  Case  Management  System  (CPCMS)  and
Pennsylvania’s  Appellate Court Management System (PACMS).

105 million  docket sheets were viewed for free on our website in 2021.

171,000  electronic  case  transfers  from  the  MDJS  to  the  CPCMS  during  2021  saved
county court staff countless hours by eliminating  the need for redundant data entry.

38,000 law enforcement and public safety officials representing more than 20 criminal
justice  partners  and  law  enforcement  agencies  depended on  the  case  management
systems to perform their daily duties during 2021.

Docket sheets and customized court reports provide valuable information to media, academics, 
attorneys, legislators,  government agencies, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and others. 

Value and Savings 

The  data  maintained  and  shared  by  the  judiciary  is  valuable  and  widely-used  by  courts, 
government  agencies,  public  safety  and law-enforcement  officials,  members  of the  public, 
media and attorneys to name a few.   

• AOPC/IT has reduced  the cost  of manually  compiling  and mailing  boxes  of official
case  records  and  transcripts  through the development  of  an  electronic  original  record
system.  A total of 38 counties and agencies are e-filing  original  records with 3,564 cases
e-filed in 2021.

 73• During  2021, 1,011  individual  law  enforcement  entities/filing  types  used e-filing  for
traffic,  parking,  and  non-traffic  citations,  and  criminal  complaints.    In  addition  to
improving  accuracy  and saving  court  staff thousands of hours  a  year,  e-filing  also  cuts
down on the time  needed to complete  traffic stops, thereby  improving  the safety of law
enforcement officers.

Court Collections 

Features within the case management systems help court staff collect and process fines, court 
costs  and  restitution  –  and  the  very  popular  PAePay®,  an  online  payment  application 
developed by AOPC/IT, allows people to pay these costs online. 

• PAePay saw a record $164 million  collected  online in 2021, a 5 percent increase  over

last year.

• Over the last 10 years, AOPC/IT collected and processed nearly $4.6 billion in fines, costs,
and restitution.  This year saw a $20 million  increase  in funds distributed over last year.

• The  case management  systems also  enhance court collections  by allowing  court officials

to identify unpaid balances and actively collect  on old and new cases.

Electronic Filing/Document  Storage Initiatives 

Pennsylvania’s  courts continue to move towards a paperless operation.  PACFile® saves time 
by allowing  the direct electronic  filing of documents with the courts by attorneys and pro se 
litigants. 

• By the end of 2021, 41 counties were using PACFile to electronically  submit filings into
CPCMS, and 51 counties were using the electronic  records management system (ERMS)
for electronic document management.

• By the end of 2021, 51 counties  were using the ERMS solution  for electronic  document

management in the MDJS.

Clean Slate 

Act 56  of 2018, which  became  effective June  28, 2019,  expanded the criminal  case  sealing 
mandate to  include  additional offenses meeting  specific  criteria  which  required  significant 
systems changes to the two case management systems (MDJS and CPCMS).  Act 83 of 2020, 
referred to as Clean Slate II, further expanded the category of eligible cases to include pardoned 
offenses and reduced the financial eligibility requirements for those with convictions to satisfy 
only court-ordered restitution and statutorily mandated fee authorized to carry out Clean Slate. 
Likewise,  the financial  requirement  for non-convictions  was also  reduced to only  satisfying 
restitution to be eligible. 

74• AOPC/IT staff cost to implement Clean Slate exceeded $4 million.

• As  of  December  2021,  42  million  cases  were  sealed  accounting  for  65%  of the  entire

caseload of the MDJS and CPCMS.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

This  appropriation  funds portions of UJS activities in support of the Commonwealth's multi-
agency Integrated Criminal Justice Information System (JNET).  The UJS has been an active
participant in JNET since  its inception, and the source for important data from its automated
systems.

JNET  is  a  statewide effort that allows  information  from  criminal  justice  and  other  related
resources  to  be  shared  among  federal,  state,  county  and  municipal  agencies.    Information
makes  its  way  to  the  end  user  through  two  sources  -  a  secure  Web-based  interface  and
Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based messaging.

The Fiscal  Year 2022-23 budget request seeks continued funding for limited staff and related
operating costs in support of JNET  functions, and a portion of the telecommunications costs
between  the  Administrative  Office  of  Pennsylvania  Court's  Information  Technology
(AOPC/IT) department and magisterial  district judge (MDJ)  offices to allow  JNET traffic to
flow to and from MDJ offices and other supporting systems and provide JNET access  to the
district courts.

This  budget request  also  seeks  funding for the continuing  development and maintenance  of
messages  published by AOPC/IT and automated use of messages published by other criminal
justice  and  related  agencies.    Messaging  is  a  method  JNET  and  AOPC/IT  use  to  move
information  between  agency  computer  systems  in  order  to  share  case  data and  to  reduce
redundant data entry.

A number  of messages  are  in  various  stages of the product development lifecycle  including
initial  development  and maintenance.    These  messages  continue  to assist  in  supporting  the
statewide Magisterial  District  Judge System  (MDJS),  Common  Pleas  Criminal  Court Case
Management System (CPCMS) and other criminal  justice agency related systems:

• The  Court Case Event (CCE) messages  are  event-triggered messages  published from the
CPCMS  and  MDJS  systems.    County  agencies  filing  electronic  information  into  the
CPCMS will receive  updated case information through this JNET messaging structure.

 78• AOPC/IT provides  JNET  with data to be  used for  a  new  JNET  Recidivism  Dashboard
initiative.    In 2022,  JNET  will  begin  to  use  the  CCE messages  to  acquire  information,
process  it  through  a  data  analysis  tool  and  deliver  secure  information  for  recidivism
statistics.

• AOPC/IT provides information  to JNET’s  Federated Warrant Search  application  and its
Federated Address application and continues to report dispositions electronically through
the  JNET  infrastructure  updating  the  Criminal  History  Repository  (CHR).    AOPC/IT
implemented an enhancement project with JNET and PSP to improve the statewide warrant
process  that  allows  the  electronic  filing  of  warrants  into  the  Commonwealth  Law
Enforcement  Assistance  Network  (CLEAN)  and  National  Crime  Information  Center
(NCIC) if all required information is filed on the initiating criminal  complaint and entered
into the MDJS.  This  eliminates  the need for the manual  entry of warrant information by
local law enforcement officers.

• AOPC/IT implemented  a message  that allows  users  of the Pennsylvania  Commission  on
Sentencing’s (PCS) Web-based Sentencing Guideline Software (SGS) to query basic case
information from the CPCMS and MDJS to assist with data entry and to reduce errors.  Per
a  request by  the PCS, functionality  was added to support their  mandate to  implement  a
recidivism  risk  assessment  tool.  AOPC/IT continues to work with the PCS in support of
this  interface  that allows  the  PCS  to  make  a  CCE  Request/Reply  that will  return  case
information  on  all  cases  where  an  identified  offender  (as  determined  by  personal
demographic  information)  was the  defendant. The Department of Corrections  (DOC)  is
using this functionality as well.

• AOPC/IT, JNET,  and  the  County  Commissioners  Association  of  Pennsylvania  (CCAP)
continue to provide Case Initiation and Case Disposition and Sentencing events to populate
county-based systems, such as District Attorney (DA) systems, Probation systems, and Jail
systems.    CCAP  offers  a  Public  Defender version  of  their  Unified  Case  Management
system (UCM), and AOPC/IT produces a public  version  of the CCE message  to be used
with this initiative  that is  transmitted utilizing  the JNET  infrastructure. The  public  CCE
message is also used by the Pennsylvania State Employee Retirement System (SERS) and
Public School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS) to support compliance monitoring
of member  benefits.

AOPC/IT continues to work with JNET to make additional information available via the JNET 
interface.  Examples include the following: 

• A mechanism  for electronic  matching  of victims  that allows  for relevant  case  data to be
sent back to the Pennsylvania  Commission  on Crime  and Delinquency (PCCD) through a
message.    This  information  will  be  used  in  making  restitution  claims  at  the  Courts  of
Common Pleas.

• Ongoing support of various  electronic filing methods for criminal  complaints,  traffic, and
non-traffic citations.    AOPC/IT and PSP implemented  a statewide project  to file  traffic

79citations electronically  into the MDJS system, and AOPC/IT continues to work with local 
police agencies  to replicate this same functionality on a municipal  level.   Electronic filing 
at both the state and municipal  level has been expanded to include parking citations, non-
traffic  citations  and  criminal  complaints.  During  2021,  over  1,000  law  enforcement 
agencies (including each filing type) facilitated electronic filings, saving district court staff 
and law enforcement officers numerous  hours by averting the need for manual data entry 
and reducing the travel time to deliver the physical copy of the citation to the court. 

•

In  January  2019,  the  AOPC,  PSP,  JNET,  and  the  Chiefs  of  Police  Association  were
awarded a  National  Criminal  History  Improvement  Program  (NCHIP) sub  grant  under
PCCD to support an update to the electronic criminal complaint e-filing and OTN single
source  generator  system  which will  enhance  the quality  of records contained in the FBI
and National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).  In addition to enhancing 
the availability  of arrest and disposition records at the state and national level,  it will also
provide  a  uniform  tool  for  state  and  municipal  police  to  file  criminal  complaints
electronically with the courts. Both the JNET electronic compliant application and the OTN 
single  source  generator  system  were  deployed in  late  2021.  AOPC/IT, JNET,  and  PSP
continue to provide support to law enforcement as this is implemented statewide.

• Creation of Web  interfaces that allow  police  departments to review  court  schedules and
case and disposition information saving the officers and MDJ offices valuable  time.

• Maintenance  of  an  interface  to  electronically 

transfer  juvenile  delinquency  case
information  from  the  CPCMS  Juvenile  Court  Module  to  the  Juvenile  Court  Judges
Commission's (JCJC's) Juvenile Tracking System (JTS) through JNET on a statewide basis
providing near real-time  updates throughout the lifecycle of the delinquency case.

• Providing  access  to  secure  Web  docket sheets  and  court  calendars  for  all  cases  in  the

CPCMS and MDJS.

• Maintaining search services to support JNET application search modules including warrant
search,  address  search,  personal  identifier  search,  and  offense search  for  the  Office of
Victim Advocates.

• Providing  real  time  messaging  to  support  JNET’s  notification  service  providing  law
enforcement and criminal  justice  agencies with proactive information on individuals that
they are tracking.

• Receiving  updated inmate location information  from the county jails  and information on
assigned  probation  officers  for  population  within  the  MDJS  and  CPCMS  applications
through JNET’s Electronic Reporting (ER) II (jail) and ER2P (probation) projects.

• Participation with PCCD, JNET, PSP, Chiefs of Police, and the Attorney General’s Office
in  maintenance  of  fingerprint  compliance  reports  to  ensure  that  PSP  has  appropriate
identifying information resulting from an arrest.

80• Ongoing work with PSP and Attorney General's Office to provide case information needed

for Megan's Law/Walsh Act compliance  tracking.

• Receiving 

information  from  Central  Participant  Subscription  Services  related  to
activations,  terminations  and  address  changes  for  attorneys,  officers,  constables  and
certified bail insurers.

• Providing/receiving  case information to/from DA offices.

• Working  with  JNET  and  the  Mid-Atlantic  Regional  Information  Sharing  (MARIS)  to

provide access to court data in support of their federated person search initiative.

• Providing  the  State  Employees  Retirement  System  (SERS),  the  Pennsylvania  Public
School Employees’ Retirement System (PSERS) and the Department of State (DOS) with
public  CCE messages  to assist  in  the identification of individuals who should have their
pensions forfeited and/or their state licenses revoked due to convictions.

• AOPC/IT supports the Guardianship Tracking System (GTS) which uses a JNET interface.
The interface provides a mechanism  for the GTS to receive  electronic case initiation  data
as new petitions are filed in the counties’  Orphans’ Courts proprietary  case management
systems.  This  reduces the necessity  for the court staff to manually enter this information
into both local systems and the GTS.

• AOPC/IT developed and implemented  an essential  service  required  to support the Clean
Slate Law (Act 56 of 2019).  Utilizing  the JNET infrastructure, the AOPC/IT department
provides  PSP with candidates for  removal  of  approved  cases/charges  from  public  view,
and when a common pleas  judge issues a Clean Slate order, communication  of that order
is  transmitted to criminal  justice  agencies  via  JNET  so  that records  may  be  marked  as
“limited  access”.    AOPC/IT  has  updated the  service  process  multiple  times  to  support
additional legislative  requirements.

7. ASSUMPTIONS

Personnel:

Act  30  of  2007  provides  for  annual  increases  in  judges'  salaries,  including  per  diem
compensation  paid  to senior  judges,  effective each  January  1  to reflect  the  latest  12-month

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The Courts of Common Pleas are courts of general trial jurisdiction, having original jurisdiction
over all cases not exclusively  assigned to another court.  Legislative  acts over the last 20 years
have  increased  the complement  from  408  to 459, with the last  judgeship  being  added in the
2021 municipal  election, effective January  3, 2022 per  Act 49 of 2017.   This  budget request
includes funding for only 444 positions (15 positions are not funded as a budgetary allowance
for vacancies during Fiscal Year 2022-23).

In courts with seven or fewer judges, those who have the longest continuous record of service
become president judges.  When courts have eight or more judges, judges select from their ranks
a president judge who serves in that capacity for a single five-year term.  Such president judges
may not serve consecutive five-year terms.

This  appropriation  for the Courts of Common  Pleas  funds the salaries,  benefits, travel  costs,
legal fees and liability  insurance (ELSIF) for all Common Pleas judges.

his appropriation funds the per diem compensation, limited benefits, and related operating 

costs (liability insurance and travel) for senior Common Pleas judges. 

he senior judge program provides an alternative resource when there is a shortage of active 
Common Pleas judges.  Shortages may occur due to judicial vacancies, recusals, and increases 
in  caseload  within  the  various  jurisdictions.    These  senior  jurists  are  available  for  service 
throughout the Commonwealth.  

n  accordance  with  Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Judicial  Administration  701  as  amended  on 
November 20, 2007, eligibility for senior judge service ends the last day of the calendar year 
in which the senior judge attains age 78.  Senior judge service ends the last day of the calendar 
year in which age 80 is attained for those senior judges then in service who were exempted by 
the imposition of age limits by Pa RJA 701.  Eligibility for senior judge service was further 
restricted  by  a  December  17,  2009  amendment  to  Rule  701,  effective  January  4,  2010,  by 
adding a minimum age requirement of 65, or a combination of years of judicial service plus 
age that totals at least 80.  As of January 3, 2022, there were 100 authorized Common Pleas 
senior judges. 

he  Judicial  Needs  Assessment  tool  (a  performance-based  metric  developed  by  the  CP 
Weighted Caseload Study) must be considered by President Judges requesting senior judge 
use, and AOPC when approving them.

7. ASSUMPTIONS

Personnel:

Act  30  of  2007  provides  for  annual  increases  in  judges'  salaries,  including  per  diem
compensation  paid to senior  judges, effective each  January  1 to  reflect the  latest 12-month
change  in  the  Consumer  Price  Index (CPI)  for  the  Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic  City,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland area.  This budget request includes a 3.0%
increase  in  the  judicial  salaries  and  per  diems  effective  January  1,  2023.    Assumptions
regarding judges' salaries  and senior judge per diem compensation are as follows:

January - June, 2023 
$101,522 
$278.91 

Per  diem  compensation  rates  paid  to  assigned  senior  magisterial  district  judges  are 
calculated by dividing the annual salary by the number of days in the judicial year, which 
is  364 days in  both 2022  and 2023.   The  budgeted rate reflects an  average  of the above 
rates.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

Forming  the  first  level  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  are  Pennsylvania's  special  courts.
Magisterial  district judges preside over these courts in all counties except Philadelphia.

With jurisdiction over summary criminal cases, landlord-tenant matters, and other civil actions
where  the amount  claimed  does not exceed $12,000  (increased  from  $8,000  by  Act 114  of
2010),  magisterial  district judges may  also  accept guilty  pleas  to misdemeanors  of the third
degree  under certain  circumstances,  issue  warrants,  and hold arraignments  and preliminary
hearings  in  criminal  cases.   Although magisterial  district judges need not be lawyers,  those

91who are not attorneys must complete an educational course and pass a qualifying examination 
before taking office.  Every magisterial  district judge and authorized senior magisterial district 
judge  must  participate  in  one  week  of  continuing  education  each  year.    These  education 
programs  are administered by the Minor  Judiciary Education Board and are  funded from the 
Magisterial  District Judge Education appropriation. 

This  Magisterial  District Judge appropriation  funds the  salaries,  benefits, travel  costs, legal 
fees,  and  liability  insurance  costs  for  all  magisterial  district  judges.    A  senior  magisterial 
district judge  program,  a per  diem program  for  magisterial  district judges traveling  outside 
their districts, printing costs for the Magisterial District Judge Journal, and a grant payment for 
the  $200  annual  registration  fee  per  judge  to  the  Special  Court  Judges  of  Pennsylvania 
Association are also funded from this appropriation.  Health benefits are provided to all retired 
magisterial  district  judges  who  qualify.    Liability  insurance  is  provided  for  those  who  are 
assigned. 

The  Supreme  Court is  charged with realigning  magisterial  districts  following  the decennial 
census.  Following the 2010 census, the Supreme Court, in an effort to consolidate magisterial 
district judge offices in a cost-cutting effort, approved realignment plans creating, eliminating, 
realigning,  and reestablishing  districts which resulted in  a net decrease  of 33 districts.  Two 
additional districts have since been eliminated, bringing the current complement, as of January 
2022, to 510.  This  budget request includes funding for only 501 positions (nine positions are 
not funded as a budgetary allowance for vacancies during Fiscal Year 2022-23). 

The  Supreme Court is  again undertaking the task of realigning  the magisterial  districts using 
the results of the 2020 census.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

Article V, Section 12, of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires  magisterial  district judges to
be members  of the bar  of the Supreme  Court or  to have  completed a  course  of training  and
instruction in  the duties of their office and to have passed an examination  prior  to assuming
office.  Courses and examinations shall  be as provided by law.

Such courses  are provided pursuant to statute, 42 Pa.C.S. Chapter 31, by the Minor  Judiciary
Education Board.  This seven-member board is responsible for the instruction and certification
of  individuals  intending  to  become  magisterial  district  judges  and  Philadelphia  Municipal
Court arraignment  court magistrates  who are not members  of the bar.   Certifying classes  for
magisterial  district  judges  are  four  weeks  in  duration  and  one  week  for  Municipal  Court
arraignment  court  magistrates.    The  board approves  the curriculum,  appoints  and evaluates
instructors,  establishes  course  content, reviews  all  tests, and issues  certificates  to successful
program participants.

Continuing education for all of the Commonwealth’s magisterial  district judges and Municipal
Court arraignment  court  magistrates  is  mandated by  the  Judicial  Code (42  Pa.C.S. Section
3118).  In addition, the Minor  Judiciary Education Board implements  Rules 601 to 604 of the
Rules of Judicial Administration promulgated by the Pennsylvania  Supreme Court.  The rules
require  annual continuing  education for magisterial  district judges, senior  magisterial  district
judges, and Municipal  Court arraignment court magistrates.  Accordingly, the board conducts
week-long  continuing  education classes  for these  officials.   The  Minor  Judiciary  Education
Board  also  approves  one  week  of  supplemental  practicum  training  for  newly-elected  and
appointed magisterial  district judges within the first year of their taking office.

This  appropriation  provides  for  programs  of  certification  and  continuing  education  for
aspirants  to  the  above  referenced  offices,  and  continuing  education  for  the  authorized
complement  of  510  magisterial  district  judges,  and  six  Philadelphia  Municipal  Court
arraignment court magistrates.  Additionally, continuing education is available for the current
98 senior magisterial  district judges.

Providing training  to active and senior  magisterial  district judges – indeed to all  judges and
senior  judges, is  a tangible  expression  of the Supreme  Court’s commitment  to professional
education for both the bench and the bar.

Grants and Subsidies:

6. NON-EXPENSE/INTERAGENCY ($000)

The budget request is based on the December 31, 2021 authorized complement of Common 
Pleas judges calculated at the effective reimbursement rate of $45,460 funded in the current 
fiscal  year  (a  proportional  reduction  of  35.06%).    Although  the  statutory  rate  remains 
$70,000  with the requirement  that no county  shall  receive  less  than 77.5  percent  of the 
actual reimbursement for court costs provided to it from funds appropriated for Fiscal Year 
1980-81 (results in a flat $10,075,327 grant payment to Philadelphia for its 93 judges), Act 
37 of 2007 requires the proportional reduction in each county’s grant if insufficient funding 
is  provided to reimburse  at  the statutory rate.    The  Judiciary  requests  the same  level  of 
funding as provided in Fiscal Year 2021-22.  ** Funding this grant at the full statutory rate 
would require  an appropriation  of $35.626 million,  an amount  $12.49 million  above  the 
amount requested. ** 

The amount requested was computed as follows: 

365  judges @ $45,460 
  93   Philadelphia judges 
458  Total complement 

$16,592,832 
   6,543,168

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

This  budget requests funds to make grant payments to counties to reimburse  costs associated
with the administration and operation  of the Courts of Common Pleas.  The grant amount is
determined by language contained in statute, and in the annual Appropriation Act that specifies
that the grant is reimbursement for the costs incurred in the prior calendar year.  Act 37 of 2007
provides that in the event the total county reimbursement  qualifying for payment exceeds the
amount appropriated, every county’s grant is to be proportionally  reduced so as not to exceed
the  amount  appropriated.    In  judicial  districts  comprising  more  than  one  county,  county
allocations  are  based  on  each  county’s  percentage  of  the  district’s  total  population.    Such
population  figures  are  based  on the  data from  the most-current  decennial  census  available,
presently 2020.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

This  request is  to help  defray county expenses  in  support of assigned  Common  Pleas  Court
senior  judges  pursuant  to  Acts  40  and  49  of  2017,  and  Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Judicial
Administration 701.    Such expenses  are  incurred to provide  suitable  facilities  and adequate

106staff to senior judges formerly of the judicial district who are regularly  or periodically assigned 
in that district and for visiting  senior judges.  Suitable facilities  and staff consist of the use of 
judicial chambers, including office equipment and supplies, and the services of a law clerk and 
a  secretary  necessary  to  conduct judicial  business.    Rule  701  seeks  the  provision  of  this 
reasonable minimal  administrative support to senior judges while on assignment. 

The  county  payment  provided  by  42  Pa.C.S.  Section  1906.1  and the  Administrative  Code 
Section  2801-E  consists  of  two  components:    staff  support  and  facilities  (appropriate 
workspace, equipment and supplies)  actually provided to senior judges of the judicial  district 
who are regularly  or periodically  assigned in that district and for visiting  senior judges.  Staff 
support consists of the services  of a secretary and a law clerk.  The services  of a secretary are 
reimbursed at the statutory rate of $12 per hour, while the services of a law clerk are reimbursed  
at the rate of $20 per hour.  Facilities, including supplies and office equipment appropriate for 
the function, are reimbursed at the statutory rate of $60 per day, billable in half-day increments. 

As mandated by statute, no county shall receive in any year reimbursement  under this grant in 
an amount that exceeds 20 percent of the amount appropriated.  Also, in the event that the total 
amount counties  are eligible  to receive  as  evidenced by claims  submitted is  greater than the 
amount  appropriated,  Act 49,  as  did Act 37  before  it,  provides  that each  county's grant  be 
proportionately reduced to bring the total within the amount appropriated.  In FY 2020-21, the 
imposition of the cap was not applied as none of the reimbursement  requests were affected by 
the cap and each county received the amount of their submitted reimbursement request since 
the total reimbursements  did not exceed the appropriation. 

Claims  must  be  submitted  annually  by  the  counties  to  the  Administrative  Office  of 
Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC).  All claims  for calendar year 2021 are to be submitted by April 
1, 2022, with payment by June 30.  Reimbursement paid in any year is for costs incurred in the 
immediate prior calendar year. 

Senior  judges are  a resource  available  to the respective  courts at the request of the president 
judge to assist  on a temporary  basis  the prompt and proper disposition of the business  of the 
court.    Caseload,  recusals,  vacancies,  and the  absence  from  the bench  of a  judge  in  active 
service  may  warrant  the  temporary  assignment  of a  senior  judge.    Per  diem  compensation 
earned by senior  jurists and related expenses are funded by a separate state appropriation;  the 
facilities and staff are funded by the counties.

his budget request continues a grant to partially reimburse counties for the costs of language 
access  services,  including  interpreters  they  provide  for  both  sign  language  and  foreign 
languages, for litigants and other participants in court cases, and to increase such services in 
accordance with Judiciary policy. Required by state and federal law, providing qualified court 
interpreters is an essential element of providing access to justice. Counties can be faced with 
an unexpected and often large expenditure when confronted with a circumstance of providing 

      113an interpreter for a protracted or complex case or for  a language when an interpreter is not 
available locally and must be obtained from a substantial distance. 

n 2014, all 60 judicial districts established local language access plans ("LAPs"), which are 
updated annually. A statewide language access plan that provides guidance to the entire UJS 
was also adopted by the Supreme Court in 2017. The UJS and district-specific LAPs prioritize 
the following services: free interpreters for LEP (limited English proficient) and deaf or hard-
of-hearing named parties in all judicial proceedings; telephone interpretation for interactions 
with LEP court users at the information and filing counters in courts; the translation of court 
forms frequently utilized by LEP court users; multilingual signage in court buildings; training 
for judges and court staff; and outreach to LEP-serving agencies. The plans are posted on the 
Language Access and Interpreter Program page of the UJS website. 

Judicial districts apply for reimbursement from  AOPC for direct expenses related to (1) in-
person interpreting, (2) telephone interpreting, and (3) other language access services specified 
in the judicial district and UJS language access plans, including production of bilingual signage 
and translation of court forms.  

OPC  is  requesting  funds  to  develop  a  pilot  video  remote  interpreting  program  to  allow 
interpreters to provide services remotely to judicial districts. $453,000 is included in the AOPC 
budget request for the cost of the pilot program. 

eimbursements requested by the counties are subject to reduction to ensure that a) no county 
is reimbursed an amount in excess of 30% of the total grant amount, and b) the total amount 
requested for reimbursement by all counties does not exceed the appropriated amount. In the 
event  that  the  total  amount  judicial  districts  are  eligible  to  receive,  as  evidenced  by  claims 
submitted,  is  greater  than  the  appropriated  amount,  each  judicial  district's  grant  will  be 
proportionately reduced to bring the sum total within the amount appropriated. 

ach  year  the  total  amount  judicial  districts  are  eligible  to  receive,  as  evidenced  by  claims 
submitted,  is  greater  than  the  appropriated  amount,  and  each  judicial  district's  grant  is 
proportionately reduced to bring the sum total within the amount appropriated. In FY 2020-21 
each county received approximately 42.45% of its qualified reimbursement.

1/ In accordance with the Court Interpreter Services Grant Policies and Procedures, the grant payments to 
Philadelphia county was reduced from $594,160 to 30% of the appropriation amount ($1,500,000) or 
$450,000.  (The reimbursement was further reduced by 57.55% as explained in note 2.)

2/ For Calendar year 2020 counties requested reimbusements for $3,677,784 for eligible expenses.  The total 
reimbursement qualifying for payment after imposition of the 30% cap totaled $3,533,626 which exceeded the 
appropriation amount of $1,500,000 by $2,033,626.  In accordance with the Court Interpreter Services Grant 
Policies and Procedures, after imposition of the 30% cap, the grant payment to each county was proportionally 
reduced by 57.55% (i.e., each county received 42.45 % of its qualified reimbursement) so that the total of all 
grants did not exceed the appropriation.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The  Judicial  Ethics  Advisory  Board  is  composed  of  judges  from  the  Superior  Court,
Commonwealth  Court,  Courts  of  Common  Pleas,  Magisterial  District  Courts,  and  the
Philadelphia  Municipal  Court,  and  also  has  a  non-judge  member.    The  Supreme  Court
designated this Board as the official body authorized to advise judges subject to the Code of
Judicial Conduct or the Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges
(“Judicial  Codes”).  As such, the Board handles requests from judges and judicial  candidates
for opinions  on the propriety of various  actions.  Following  investigation and research  of the

118issues  raised,  the  members  of the  Board issue  written  opinions;  a  judge  who  requests  and 
complies  with Board advice may  raise that compliance  as a factor in the event of subsequent 
disciplinary  investigation or proceedings.  

The  Board addresses diverse,  complex  issues  under  the Judicial  Codes, the Election  Code, 
financial  reporting  laws,  campaign  activities,  and First Amendment issues.    Previously,  two 
separate  committees,  each  with a  separate  membership  limited to one  type of judge, issued 
separate opinions.  The complexity of issues,  and the need for consistent, uniform rulings and 
increased transparency, underscore both the benefits of this updated ethics advisory structure 
and the challenges  facing the Board in  its  work.   This  funding provides the Board with the 
minimal  resources  for legal  staff to assist with its work and to catalogue opinions.

11. PROGRAM STATEMENT

The Judicial  Conduct Board of Pennsylvania  was created as an independent board within the
Judicial Branch by an amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution adopted on May 18, 1993,
and declared in effect by the Governor on August 11, 1993.  It is the Judicial Conduct Board’s
responsibility  within  the  Judicial  Branch  to  investigate  allegations  of  judicial  misconduct,
disability, or impairment  and to prosecute deserving cases in the Court of Judicial Discipline.

The  board  has  jurisdiction  over  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court  Justices,  Superior  and
Commonwealth  Court  Judges, Common  Pleas  Court Judges,  Philadelphia  Municipal  Court
Judges and Magisterial  District Judges.

Under the Constitution of Pennsylvania,  the board is the constitutionally identified agency of
state government with the authority to investigate judges for misconduct or physical or mental
disability.    Its  role  is  unique.  The  board’s  system  has  served  Pennsylvania  well  since  its
inception in 1993.  Some judges have been publicly disciplined for judicial misconduct, others
have  been  confidentially cautioned, and a number  have  resigned  while  under inquiry.   It is
undoubtedly fair to state that the Pennsylvania judiciary is aware of its ethical obligations and
the potential consequences for ethical breaches.

As mandated by the Constitution, the board comprises twelve members serving staggered four
year terms, as follows:  six citizen electors who are neither attorneys nor judges; three judges,
including one appellate court judge, one common pleas court judge, and one magisterial district
judge; and three attorneys who are not judges.  The Governor appoints six members  and the
Supreme Court appoints six members.   No more than half of the members may be of the same
political party.

Members  meet regularly  to conduct board business.   They receive  no compensation  for their
service.   Members  may not serve more than four consecutive years;  however, a member  may
be reappointed for an additional term after the lapse of one year from the end of the member’s
previous  term.   Except for judicial  members,  no member  of the board, during the member’s
term, may hold a compensated public office or public appointment.

The  Constitution requires  that the board appoint  a Chief Counsel  and other necessary  staff.
Currently, the board has an authorized complement  of 15.  Six of the approved positions are
for licensed  attorneys, including the Chief Counsel, the Deputy Chief Counsel, three Deputy
Counsel and one Assistant Counsel.  There are four investigators and five administrative staff.

The Chief Counsel provides legal advice to the board and, along with the other staff attorneys,
serves as trial counsel in proceedings before the Court of Judicial Discipline.  The board’s legal

 123staff is responsible  for overseeing the investigation of cases, advising the board as to courses 
of action concerning  cases,  and preparing  and prosecuting cases  before the Court of Judicial 
Discipline. 

In the event of appeals from orders of the Court of Judicial Discipline, board counsel represent 
the board  before the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court (or  the constitutionally  provided Special 
Tribunal  in the event that the appeal from the Court of Judicial Discipline  involves  a member 
of the Supreme Court).   

Board counsel are also tasked with acting as the board’s open records officer and open records 
appeals  officer  as  required  by  the  Commonwealth’s  Right-to-Know  Law.    In  addition  to 
responding  to  right-to-know  requests,  board  counsel  also  represent  the  board in  appeals  to 
Commonwealth Court from right-to-know determinations.  

The  board is  required to administer  its own budget, publish  and distribute an annual  report, 
exercise  supervisory  and administrative authority over all board staff, and implement  its own 
rules of procedure.  Board headquarters are maintained in the Pennsylvania Judicial Center in 
Harrisburg.   The board has initiated many cost-cutting measures over the last several  years to 
efficiently  and  effectively serve  the  interests  of  the  Commonwealth’s  taxpayers,  including 
closing the board’s regional offices in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and having its investigators 
work from home offices. 

During  calendar  year  2021,  the  board  received  or  initiated  787  confidential  requests  for 
investigation.    A  total  of  785  pending  matters  were  disposed  of  during  that  same  period. 
Investigative requests are not necessarily  resolved in the year in which they are received and 
may  remain  active  for  several  years.    Of  the  resolved  matters,  725  were  dismissed  after 
preliminary  inquiry,  7 were dismissed after full investigation, 21 were dismissed with Letters 
of Caution, and 9  were  dismissed  with Letters of Counsel.    Four  matters  were closed  after 
disposition  by  the Court  of  Judicial  Discipline.    Formal  charges  were  filed in  the  Court of 
Judicial Discipline against two judges, comprising  two pending investigative files.  The Board 
also filed one Petition for Interim Suspension  Without Pay in the Court of Judicial Discipline 
concerning one judge.   

This appropriation provides funding for the board’s operating expenses, annuitant benefits, and 
the salaries and benefits of the board’s staff.  Funding of the board’s budget request is important 
so  that the  board may  continue  to  carry  out its  core  governmental  function pursuant  to its 
constitutional mandate. 

The  prompt  and effective  operation  of Pennsylvania’s  judicial  disciplinary  system  plays  a 
critical  role  in promoting  and maintaining  public  confidence in  the administration of justice. 
The  sufficient allocation  of resources  to the Judicial Conduct Board helps  demonstrate to all 
Pennsylvanians  that their representatives stand committed to the pursuit of justice.

Budget Request Funding Needs

The Court of Judicial Discipline  seeks the same amount as last year, $606,000.  This  amount
should be adequate to continue the mission  of the Court.

The Court is leanly staffed with only two employees;  counsel,  and court administrator. There
are nine active cases before the Court with more  likely  to be filed soon.  Several  of the cases
will  result in multi-day hearings.   There  are  also two cases  with judges serving  probationary
sanctions which are being supervised by the Court’s counsel.

Last year, the Court decided six cases. The cases before the court have become more complex
in  recent years  as they now tend to involve  repeated episodes of poor demeanor or  multiple
counts of unrelated conduct rather than the single instances of misconduct pursued in the past.

The Court

The Court of Judicial Discipline  is a court of record established in 1993 under Article V, §18
of the Pennsylvania  Constitution.  The court serves as a trial court for complaints  filed by the
Judicial Conduct Board alleging judicial misconduct by a judicial officer.  To perform its task,
it is required by the Constitution to appoint staff and prepare and administer its own budget as
provided by law and undertake actions needed to ensure its efficient operation.

The court hears and decides cases involving  allegations of judicial misconduct prosecuted by
the Judicial  Conduct Board.  The court enters findings of fact and conclusions  of law and, if
misconduct is found to have occurred, imposes  an appropriate sanction.  Formal charges filed
with the court are a matter of public record and all hearings  conducted by the court are public
proceedings.    Proceedings  are  conducted pursuant to  the rules  adopted by  the court  and in
accordance with the principles  of due process and the Rules of Evidence.  Official court records
and dockets are maintained and preserved by the Clerk of the Court of Judicial Discipline.

The court is composed of eight members,  four of whom are appointed by the Supreme  Court
and  four  appointed  by  the  Governor.    Pursuant  to  the  Constitution,  the  Supreme  Court
appointees include two judges, one magisterial district judge, and one non-lawyer elector.  The
Governor’s appointees include one judge, two non-judge members of the bar, and a non-lawyer
elector.  The members  serve without compensation.

Since the court’s inception, 109 formal complaints and 42 petitions for interim relief have been
submitted for review.  For the calendar year  2021, the court handled trials or proceedings in
ten separate cases.  Members of the court supervised pre-trial discovery with the litigants and
held pre-trial conferences to ensure the fair and prompt disposition of cases.  When the record
could not be resolved  by  way of factual stipulations,  trials  were  promptly  scheduled by  the
court and timely decisions were filed.

 127Educational Court Functions 

In  addition  to  performing  the  above-noted  constitutional  functions,  the  Court  of  Judicial 
Discipline  has  taken  an  active  role  by  providing  educational  opportunities  for  a  variety  of 
audiences.    The  staff  of  the  court  has  presented  programs  that  educate  judicial  officers, 
members  of the Pennsylvania Bar, and the general public  regarding judicial  ethics in general, 
and the Commonwealth’s judicial  discipline system. 

Additionally, court staff have  prepared  and presented  continuing  legal  education  programs, 
including  presentations throughout Pennsylvania,  pertaining  to the Commonwealth’s  system 
of judicial discipline.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
