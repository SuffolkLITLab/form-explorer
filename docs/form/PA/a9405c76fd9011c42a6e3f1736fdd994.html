Pa. Supreme Court 
Creates Autism in the 
Courts Taskforce

Following the statewide Autism in the Courts listening 
tour, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has created a 
taskforce focused on issues affecting justice-involved 
individuals with autism and intellectual disabilities. 

Partnering with the Office of Children and Families in the 
Courts (OCFC) and led by Justice Kevin Dougherty
Kevin Dougherty on 
behalf of the Supreme Court, the taskforce will provide 
increased training opportunities for judges, help further 
identify gaps in the system for individuals with autism and 
create a local roadmap to resources and services. 

“By creating a taskforce and partnering with the OCFC 
who work primarily with youth in the dependency court 
system, we’re positioning ourselves to better assist those 
who need it before they enter the court system,” Justice 
Dougherty said.

Led by Justice Dougherty, members of the taskforce 
include judges from different counties across the state, 
Children and Youth Services (CYS) county directors, 
hearing officers, state partners (including Juvenile Court 
Judges' Commission and Pa. Department of Human 
Services, etc.), as well as representatives from AOPC 
Communications and OCFC.

At the end of March, the group of nearly thirty members 
attended the first Pennsylvania Autism in the Dependency 
Court Taskforce Summit. 

From doctors explaining neurodiversity and the 
opportunities it brings, to staff from state agencies 
describing the resources and services available to youth 
– the three-day summit covered a vast variety of topics 
and provided taskforce members with a range of different 
perspectives. 

A particularly informative session featured a panel of 
parents who discussed the challenges and rewards in 
parenting a youth with autism or being a parent with 

“Our goal is to bring 
together top thought leaders, 
advocates and practitioners 
from the courts, autism 
and intellectual disabilities 
communities, advocates 
and children and youth 
professionals so that we can 
continue working to develop a 
framework within the courts 
to assist those in need.”

Justice Kevin Dougherty

autism, and what things are important for courts to know 
and consider as they interact with children and parents. 

In 2020, the Supreme Court first signaled its commitment 
to Pennsylvanians with autism by forming a first-of-its-kind 
partnership with the Pa. Department of Human Services 
to heighten the focus on helping judges better understand 
and communicate with individuals with autism.

Pa. Supreme Court Celebrates  
300th Anniversary  

This May will mark the official 300th anniversary of the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania.

To celebrate and commemorate the occasion, the Court will hold a series of 
events during the third week of the month aimed at highlighting the Court’s 
unique role and how its decisions affect every Pennsylvanian. 

“Created on May 22, 1722, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is older than 
the U.S. Supreme Court and has played an important role in the history of the 
Commonwealth beginning long before the Declaration of Independence was 
drafted here. The other justices and I very much look forward to participating 
in this historic milestone,” Chief Justice Max Max BaerBaer said.

The events will include a special Supreme Court Argument Session at Old 
City Hall in Philadelphia, as well as a two-day Symposium at the National 
Constitution Center – which will review key aspects of the Court's history, 
jurisprudence and role in today’s society.   

The panel members will include the Justices of the PA Supreme Court, the 
Chief Justices of South Carolina, Ohio and Rhode Island, the former Chief 
Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals D. Brooks Smith, Pennsylvania 
Thomas G. Saylor,  and retired United States Supreme 
Chief Justice Emeritus Thomas G. Saylor
Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, as well as prominent legal scholars and 
members of the bar. 

The symposium is eligible for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) and 
Continuing Judicial Education (CJE) credits for any lawyer or judge who 
attends and completes the registration process through AOPC/Judicial 
Education. 

A special webpage dedicated to the Court’s 300th anniversary has been 
created and hosts background and historical information about the Court and 
each justice, details for the upcoming events, 3D tours of the state’s Supreme 
Courtrooms and more.

The Early Successes of GTS

Since the implementation of the Guardianship Tracking 
System (GTS), counties have seen the real-world impact it 
has had on some of the state’s most vulnerable citizens. 

Perhaps one of the most instrumental features of the 
GTS is its ability to provide information to courts in near 
real time when a guardian is removed from a case due 
to abuse, neglect or financial exploitation. The GTS also 
automatically flags potential concerns of loss and neglect 
on reports filed annually by the guardian(s). The flag logic 
promotes a uniform protocol for courts to review filed 
guardianship reports and enhance the ability to monitor 
guardianship cases. 

There have been many success stories that have emerged 
from the field over the past couple of years in which the 
GTS has played a crucial role in protecting the lives of 
incapacitated Pennsylvanians.

In York County…
In York County…

When a professional guardian who was appointed on 
guardianship cases in many counties was charged with 
crimes related to financial malfeasance, Orphans’ Court 
Judge Clyde Vetter
Clyde Vetter issued an alert in GTS, allowing the 
AOPC to work fast to notify the local courts in 16 counties. 

“We were very quickly, literally within minutes, able 
to generate a comprehensive list of all the impacted 
guardianship cases, and we were able to follow up with 
counties until the guardian was removed (in compliance 
with the bail conditions) and a successor was appointed 
on each case,” AOPC/IT Analyst Manager Amy Whitworth
Amy Whitworth 
said. “This would have been very difficult, and may not 
have been possible at all, without the GTS.”

In Dauphin County…
In Dauphin County…

When the Office of Elder Justice in the Courts (OEJC) 
received information from a long-term care pharmacy 
company concerned that a guardian was not making 
regular payments for an incapacitated person’s 
medication, the GTS again allowed for a quick response. 

Once notified by the OEJC, court staff were able to 
quickly find the case and identify all other cases to which 
the guardian in question had been appointed.   

Orphans’ Court Judge John Cherry
alert, thereby immediately notifying every orphans’ court 
in which the guardian had an active case(s). 

John Cherry issued a statewide 

In Luzerne County… 
In Luzerne County… 

In Luzerne County, Orphans’ Court Judge Richard M. 
Richard M. 
Hughes III
Hughes III was alerted by the GTS that a guardian was 
overdue on mandatory annual reporting.  After the 
guardian refused to respond to the court’s order to file 
reports, Judge Hughes asked the police to conduct 
a wellness check on the incapacitated person.  The 

incapacitated person was found to be homeless because 
his guardian - his sister - had abandoned him in Wilkes-
Barre’s public square.  

Thanks to Judge Hughes’ action on information provided 
by the GTS, a potential tragedy was averted.  He removed 
the sister as guardian and appointed a successor 
guardian who located services for the incapacitated 
person.

In Butler County…
In Butler County…

A guardian in Butler County was caught transferring over 
$134,000 in assets out of an incapacitated person’s estate 
without proper authority. 

Flagging the unauthorized gift expense, the GTS allowed 
for a quick response by the Clerk of the Orphans’ Court 
Sarah Edwards, who immediately reported the concern to 
Sarah Edwards
a judge. 

Keys to success  
Keys to success  

As is the case with the AOPC’s other statewide systems, 
the GTS has helped to unify court processing for 
guardianships. Counties have established or are working 
toward optimizing a report review protocol, and guardians 
who work across multiple counties now interact with 
all orphans’ courts through a standard, electronic-filing 
platform and process.  

“The real success story of the GTS is the 
impact it has had in actively promoting 
a conversation around guardianship 
monitoring, shining a light on cases that 
may not have received much attention,” 
Whitworth explained.  

“Counties have become more actively engaged with 
guardians and improved their experiences and level 
of support while providing more oversight to better 
secure the well-being and financial assets of our 
Commonwealth’s most vulnerable citizens.”

Supported Decision-Making:  An Alternative to Guardianship 

The benefits of SDM
The benefits of SDM

The SDM process not only helps enhance the rights of 
individuals who might otherwise have been subjected 
to a guardianship, but its use can also avoid numerous 
unnecessary court proceedings and save all parties time 
and money. 

Certain judges and state courts, along with related 
agencies and organizations, have been instrumental in 
expanding the knowledge and use of SDM. Chief Justice 
Nathan Hecht of the Texas Supreme Court led the effort to 
pass the country’s first SDM statute in 2015. 

As SDM continues to attract interest and grow in use, 
the Advisory Council and OEJC are discussing efforts to 
promote it in Pennsylvania. 

The Montgomery County Elder Access to Justice 
Roundtable, along with the AOPC, OEJC and the Advisory 
Council, will hold a hybrid roundtable event to explore 
SDM and other alternatives to guardianships.  

The all-day event will be held on Friday, June 17 at the 
Villanova Conference Center and will be simultaneously 
livestreamed via Zoom. 

Panels of experts and breakout sessions throughout the 
day will offer in-depth discussions on less restrictive 
alternatives to guardianship – including mediation, 
restorative justice, SDM, community supports and legal 
alternatives.

Continuing Legal Education credits (CLEs) will be available 
for Pennsylvania attorneys who attend, and social workers 
and certified guardians may receive Continuing Education 
Units (CEUs).

During their March meeting, the Office of Elder Justice in 
the Courts (OEJC) and Advisory Council on Elder Justice in 
the Courts (Advisory Council) heard from a guest speaker 
about an alternative to guardianship that has been gaining 
nationwide attention in recent years. 

Nina Kohn, professor at Syracuse University College 
of Law, discussed the emerging practice of supported 
decision-making (SDM) as an option for judges and courts 
to consider in instances where individuals who might 
otherwise be unable to make their own decisions (due to 
cognitive impairments, etc.) do so with support from others.

SDM allows individuals in need of assistance to make 
choices about their own lives with support from a person 
or team of people they choose and trust. After identifying 
the areas in which assistance is needed, the individual 
chooses supporters and together they may execute a 
supported decision-making agreement. 

The network of trusted supporters – who can be family 
members, co-workers, friends, past or present service 
providers, etc. – present the pros and cons of any 
decision to be made and help individuals understand the 
ramifications of their choices.

The role of the courts
The role of the courts

Although Pennsylvania does not currently have a statute 
specifically recognizing the enforceability of a written 
supported decision-making agreement, the guardianship 
statute recognizes that individuals may not need a 
guardian when family or community support is available 
and adequate to assist them in making their own decisions. 

Courts are required by statute to give serious 
consideration to whether family and community support 
can meet the needs of an incapacitated or partially 
incapacitated person without the need for guardianship.

remarks on behalf of his colleagues on the Court. 

Speaking to the graduates, Justice Brobson said, 
“Together, you’ve added important chapters to the stories 

of your lives – moments which now provide hope for those 
still struggling.” 

“Ten years from now you’ll look back on this moment and 
realize how far you’ve come, and I hope you’ll always 
remember the significance of your story and the people 
who got you to this point.” 

Over the past ten years, 123 veterans have been admitted 
to Dauphin County Veterans Treatment Court and 82 
have graduated. Veteran participants have included those 
from Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Operation Enduring Freedom/
Operation Iraqi Freedom, Grenada, the Korean War and 
others.

Pa. Problem-Solving Courts Study Shows 
Reduction in Recidivism and Statewide Costs 

According to a recent study, 
Pennsylvania’s Problem-Solving 
Courts programs have resulted in 
increased success for participants 
and significant cost savings to 
taxpayers. 

According to the report all 
Pennsylvania DUI Courts showed 
reductions in recidivism for all charge 
types at three-year post entry, with 
the overall reduction in recidivism for 
DUI court participants at 36 percent.

Supported in part by a grant from the 
U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of 
Justice Assistance, the AOPC worked 
with NPC Research to perform a 
statewide study of Pennsylvania’s 
Adult Drug Treatment Courts (ATCs) 
and Driving Under the Influence 
Courts (DUI) between 2013 and 2018. 

In commissioning the study, the 
AOPC charged NPC Research with 
evaluating program costs and 
measuring outcomes including those 
related to participant recidivism. 

Statewide, DUI courts saved more 
than $8.5 million for the three years 
after program entry as a result of 
fewer rearrests, court cases and 
person and property victimization, 
according to the study results.

The study also found that a majority 
of Pennsylvania’s ATCs showed 
reductions in recidivism by more 
than 75 percent in some programs, 
with a majority demonstrating better 
results than comparison groups for 
all rearrests. 

7

Like DUI Courts, ATCs have saved 
nearly $50 million statewide over 
three years due to decreased arrests, 
fewer court dates, jail days saved 
and victimizations due to person or 
property crimes.

OCFC Expands Family Engagement Initiative;  
Develops New Judicial Resources  

Continuing its efforts to enhance meaningful family 
involvement in Pennsylvania’s child dependency system, 
the Office of Children and Families in the Courts (OCFC) 
recently developed and released new online resources for 
attorneys and judges navigating the system.  

Family Engagement Initiative – Phase 4 
Family Engagement Initiative – Phase 4 

Established by the Pennsylvania State Roundtable 
in 2017, Pennsylvania’s Family Engagement Initiative 
(FEI) is designed to assist select counties in furthering 
collaborative efforts between the judiciary and child 
welfare agency.

OCFC developed this online training session for attorneys 
practicing in dependency court—guardians ad litem, child 
counsel, parent attorneys and solicitors.

The session provides information that can help attorneys 
understand common issues and better advocate for 
clients. Issues like trauma, safety, visitation, child 
development, family finding and family group decision 
making are not topics taught in law school, but attorneys 
need to understand when participating in dependency 
court. 

Benchbook Resource Companion
Benchbook Resource Companion

Earlier this year, three more counties joined the expanding 
initiative – Bradford, Lycoming and Washington – bringing 
the current total number of participating counties to 18.

In February, the second edition of the Pennsylvania 
Benchbook Resource Companion was released.

The long-term goal of the initiative is to increase the 
likelihood that children will safely remain in their own 
home or will be placed with family if out-of-home 
placement is necessary. 

All participating FEI counties must have demonstrated 
strong court/child welfare agency collaboration and 
a desire to enhance family engagement strategies to 
produce the best possible outcomes for children and 
families in the child welfare system.

Dependency System

The new resource companion contains an updated 
collection of social science resources and three new topic 
sections – Autism, Implicit Bias and Reasonable Efforts.

Revised by the Pennsylvania Dependency Benchbook 
Committee, a group of seasoned trial court judges 
overseeing dependency proceedings, the resource 
companion is intended to provide judges with a 
compilation of social science resources, pertinent to their 
work in dependency court, that can be easily accessed. 

While this resource was created by judges for judges, all 
of those involved in Pennsylvania’s child dependency 
system are encouraged to access and utilize this resource.

Caseload highlights during the pandemic

For the past two years, the AOPC/
Research and Statistics department 
has monitored and reported monthly 
caseload statistics for all levels of court 
in Pennsylvania via the AOPC Caseload 
Highlights Report.  

What began as a monthly update to 
state and county leadership has led to 
an interactive, publicly available data 
dashboard that is the definitive source 
of information on Pennsylvania court 
caseloads from pre-pandemic, “baseline” 
years to the present.  

The report is a collaboration between 
AOPC/Research, AOPC/IT, the appellate 
court prothonotaries, district court 
administrators, the county prothonotaries, 
clerks of court and Orphans’ Court and 
Philadelphia Municipal Court. 

While the statistics are preliminary, they provide 
an accurate representation of the direction and 
magnitude of changes in monthly caseloads. The 
report also serves as an “early warning” of developing case backlogs by displaying changes in pending caseloads and 
case clearance rates (a.k.a., the number of existing cases going out as compared to the number of new cases coming in.) 

12

(continued)

The first edition was released in June 2020. With very few exceptions, case filings declined during the early months of 
the pandemic – some moderately, others sharply. In Common Pleas Courts, criminal filings immediately dropped by over 
80 percent, while civil filings fell by more than 70 percent. In the lower courts, traffic filings decreased over 80 percent, 
while landlord/tenant filings were 97 percent lower than pre-pandemic, baseline levels.  

Some case types have partially rebounded or stabilized compared to pre-pandemic levels, while others continue to 
decrease.

Ongoing monitoring of caseload patterns detected particular increases in Common Pleas credit card debt collection 
cases and criminal weapons offenses. 

Also observed was a steep drop in residential 
mortgage foreclosure filings, which persists today. 

Building on the model developed for the Caseload 
Highlights Report, in mid-2021 the AOPC/Research 
and Statistics department began producing a 
weekly AOPC Landlord-Tenant Report in order to 
track eviction filings, dispositions and cases pending 
following the expiration of federal and state eviction 
moratoria. Published as a data dashboard, this report 
serves as a tool for MDJs in the monitoring and 
management of landlord/tenant matters.  

The annotated chart on the next page illustrates 
the sharp decline in monthly landlord/tenant filings 
early in the pandemic and the partial “rebound” that 
occurred in late 2021 (Magisterial District Courts and 
Philadelphia Municipal Court).

(continued)

Producing these reports has strengthened AOPC’s partnerships with judicial district administration and county row office 
personnel, who have shared interest in obtaining timely caseload statistics to inform decision making.  

Employee Burnout: How It Happens  
and What You Can Do to Help 

Written by Life Advantages - Author Dr. Delvina Miremadi ©2022  
Reprinted with permission from BHS Focus. 

Employee burnout happens in every 
workplace. Workers may start the 
job as enthusiastic employees, and 
then turn into problem people who 
show up late or don’t show up at all. 
If you know of workers who have 
lost motivation for their jobs and 
show signs of apathy, they may be 
experiencing employee burnout.

A worker can experience burnout 
due to a great amount of stress; 
this stress can be job-related, but it 
can also be a result of great levels 
of stress at home. The important 
thing to remember is that employee 
burnout can be reversed and there 
are things managers and employers 
can do to help an employee get back 
on track.

How Does Burnout Happen?
How Does Burnout Happen?

Burnout occurs when a person is 
placed under stress for a long time. 
Oftentimes, the person is physically 
and/or emotionally exhausted, and 
no longer functions like he or she 
used to. If an employee has been 
placed in a demanding situation at 
work or at home, the person may 

suffer symptoms of burnout as a 
result, especially if the stress is 
persistent and ongoing.

An employee may experience 
burnout if he or she was passed 
over for a promotion or overworked 
without recognition, or if there is 
continual change in a department. 
An internal inability to set 
appropriate boundaries may also 
contribute to burnout. For instance, 
employees might bring too much 
work home with them.

Recognizing Employee Burnout
Recognizing Employee Burnout

Burnout symptoms are:

•  A change in work habit or 

attitude
Loss of enthusiasm or motivation

• 
•  Absenteeism or tardiness
•  Negative reactions or comments
• 
•  Health problems
•  Drug or alcohol use

Emotional outbursts

Additionally, as an employer or 
supervisor, there are steps that can 
be taken to help avoid employee 
burnout affecting the workplace:

14

• 

If your company is downsizing, 
readjust workloads in creative 
ways. Ask employees for input, 
and see which tasks they would 
prefer to do and which tasks they 
would like to avoid.
•  Give ample notice about 

changes in positions or tasks. If 
downsizing has occurred, firm 
up schedules to give a sense of 
routine and continuity.
•  Redistribute workloads if 

• 

• 

employees seem overwhelmed.
Listen to employees and try to 
counsel them the best you can.
Pay attention to what motivates 
each individual employee and 
utilize that when assigning 
projects.

•  Understand your personality 

• 

style and be aware of how that 
can play a role with individual 
employee communication.
Schedule after-work events to 
boost employees’ spirits.
•  Refer employees to resources 
provided by your Employee 
Assistance Program (EAP).

Pa. Judges Address Civic Engagement  
During Black History Month 

In recognition of Black History Month, the Pennsylvania 
Courts hosted a one-hour Facebook Live event on Feb. 23 
with a diverse panel of judges to discuss the importance 
of civic engagement.

Moderated by Pa. House Rep. Jordan Harris, judges 
described how opportunities to interact with the 
community can help empower youth and/or those 
transitioning from the court system.

Participant judges included Superior Court Judge Carolyn 
Carolyn 
Nichols
Kim Berkeley 
Nichols, Allegheny County President Judge Kim Berkeley 
ClarkClark, Allegheny County Common Pleas Court Judge 
Nicola Henry-Taylor
Michael Muth 
Nicola Henry-Taylor, Monroe County MDJ Michael Muth
Charles Hayden.
and Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Charles Hayden

For anyone interested in watching, the event was 
recorded and available on the PA Courts YouTube page.

Some judges like Delaware County 
Common Pleas Judge Tinu Moss
Tinu Moss 
exemplified the message of civic 
engagement, taking to the classroom 
to engage directly with children in her 
community.  

Participating in Read Across America Day 
in early March, she read to students at 
Ardmore Avenue, Bell Avenue and Walnut 
Elementary Schools. 

Judge Moss, as with every judge who 
is active in their community, is allowing 
children to see themselves represented in 
positions of power at a young age – and 
that can make a world of difference.

Women Helping 
Women

When asked by a friend to join her on a 
mission to help under-privileged women, 
Soumya Krishnamurthi 
AOPC/IT Manager Soumya Krishnamurthi 
did not hesitate to say yes. 

Professional Women and Women 
Entrepreneurs (POWER) is a nonprofit 
dedicated to helping fellow women reach 
their goals. Soumya and a group of her 
friends, including the now founder and 
chairman of POWER, continue to carry 
through that mission today.

“POWER creates an environment and 
platform for South Asian and American 
women to come together and provide 
information, guidance and opportunities to 
help achieve each other’s goals,” Soumya 
said. 

“Not all Asian and American women have 
the means to explore and get proper insight 
into education, business, jobs, political and 
social opportunities. POWER provides that 
opportunity and support to women to help 
them grow into self-driven educators and 
providers in the community.”

Soumya has served in various roles since 
the organization’s inception in 2018 – 
including as secretary of POWER for two 
years, and now in both advisory and public 
relations roles.  

As secretary, she was responsible for 
planning and hosting POWER’s many 
annual charity events. 

“Every year, as part of our International 
Women’s Day celebration, we pick a theme 
based on world events and/or current affairs, 
invite speakers who are experts in that field 
to speak at the event, and donate funds 
raised to an organization that is associated 
with the theme. As an example, the theme 
for 2020 was Autism and Parkinson’s 
awareness, primarily because not many 
Asian Indian families feel comfortable 
opening-up about their kids being on the 
autistic spectrum,” Soumya said. 

“The purpose of the event was to get them 
to feel comfortable about it and connect 
them to the right people. Funds raised were 
donated to the Applied Behavioral Analysis 
(ABA) in PA Initiative and the American 
Parkinson Disease Association.”

Soumya Krishnamurthi pictured on far right.

“As an immigrant woman I am well aware of the 
difficulties women face on a daily basis here. I was 
fortunate enough to grow up in a well-educated, 
affluent family and did not have to struggle through 
each step of life. Not everyone is as fortunate. 
POWER’s mission aligns with how I feel about giving 
back to society and helping women.” 

Soumya Krishnamurthi
Soumya Krishnamurthi

While some annual events like the International Women’s Day dinner and 
the Mother’s Day Walk/Run offer a fun way to raise funds, POWER also 
organizes events that administer direct aid to communities. Each October, 
the organization sets up a medical camp for refugees and the under-
privileged – an event coordinated by Soumya.

Most recently, Soumya spearheaded and coordinated an event to 
introduce girls to the STEM field and encourage them to try their hand 
at coding, partnering with a local women-owned small business called 
Code Ninjas.

De-escalation of Volatile Encounters

The experience of going to court is daunting and 
frustrating for many individuals, and when exacerbated 
by issues related to mental health, trauma or stress – a 
situation may become volatile.

For this reason, the AOPC/Judicial District Security 
developed a training program via WebEx on “Effective  
De-Escalation Strategies for Volatile Encounters.” 

The one-hour program is designed specifically for judges, 
district court administrators and court personnel. 

Led by AOPC/Judicial Security Administrator Rob Granzow
Rob Granzow 
and Assistant Director Kyle Ramberger
provides judges and court staff with basic strategies for 
preventing volatile encounters and effective techniques 
for de-escalating those situations should they arise. 

Kyle Ramberger, the webinar 

The program describes common behaviors and 
conditions associated with volatile encounters and equips 
participants with tools for handling these interactions both 
in person, and via phone or email. 

Throughout the webinar, Granzow uses his own 
experience to illustrate the progression of a hostile 
encounter and how to strategically avoid specific 
language and behaviors that might inflame an already 
distressed individual. 

When dealing with a court user who appears frustrated 
or distraught, absolute attentiveness and active listening 
are essential attributes in order to prevent the possible 
perception of insincerity that might further aggravate 
them. 

Some tips for dealing with agitated individuals:

•  Patience and resolute professionalism are key. 
•  Maintain eye contact and professional facial    
  expressions. 
•  Keep a low and calm voice.

In addition to providing some ways to calm down a 
tense situation, the training offers some techniques for 
court staff to adopt that may help to prevent a volatile 
encounter from occurring in the first place. 

For example, extending a courteous and sincere greeting 
to all court users can set a favorable tone for ensuing 
interactions. 

AOPC/Judicial Security hosts this WebEx several times 
every year. Judicial districts may request a presentation 
by contacting the office at JudicialSecurity@pacourts.us. 

Continuing Judicial Education (CJE) credits are now being offered to judges who attend this training.

STUDY FINDS REMOTE 
HEARINGS TAKE LONGER, 
BUT IMPROVE ACCESS

Reprinted with permission from the National Center for State 
Courts newsletter – @ the Center. 

Remote proceedings take about a third longer than in-person hearings largely due to technology-related issues and 
lack of preparation by participants, according to an NCSC exploratory study of Texas courts. But the study also found 
that remote proceedings take longer because they increase access to justice, as litigants can more easily attend and 
participate in hearings.

This first national review of data confirms what judges have anecdotally shared about remote hearings before and 
during the pandemic. The 12-month study analyzed both 1.25 million minutes of judicial data and focus group feedback 
from judges and court leaders in eight counties across Texas.

David Slayton, former Texas state court administrator and NCSC vice president for Court Consulting Services, said the 
study’s findings mostly confirmed what Texas court leaders thought to be true. However, he was somewhat surprised 
that remote hearings take longer across all case types. That, he said, points to technology being an issue for all courts 
to address.

Both he and the report suggest that courts can reduce the length of hearings by hiring “technology bailiffs,” who can 
better prepare remote hearing participants for their hearings and handle technology glitches that occur during hearings.

Other recommendations include:

•  Creating guidelines to determine which hearings should be in-person or remote.

Scheduling hearings efficiently while also considering litigant participation.

• 

• 

• 

• 

Ensuring paperwork is completed before hearings begin.

Providing easily accessible systems for participant use.

Encouraging judges to take breaks between hearings.

“We have already begun working on how to implement some of the recommendations from the report,” said Jeffrey 
Tsunekawa, director of research and court services for the Texas Office of Court Administration. “For instance, there is 
a need for template instructions and expectations for virtual hearings. Often, valuable hearing time is spent verbally 
communicating these instructions when they could have been relayed in writing prior to the hearing. We are working 
to collect samples from across the state to share with other courts. We are also reaching out to courts to collect best 
practices and suggested practices now that courts have had two years of experience with remote hearings.”
