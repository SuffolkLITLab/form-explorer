EFORE:  DUBOW, J., KUNSELMAN, J., and NICHOLS, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY NICHOLS, J.:                             FILED MARCH 22, 2023 

Appellant  Dennis  Kenneth  Madison  appeals  pro  se  from  the  order 

denying  his  second  Post  Conviction  Relief  Act1  (PCRA)  petition  as  untimely.  

Appellant  argues  that  the  PCRA  court  erred  in  concluding  that  he  failed  to 

meet an exception to the PCRA time bar.  We affirm. 

The underlying facts of this matter are well known to the parties.  See 

PCRA Ct. Op., 6/30/22, at 1-3.  Briefly, Appellant pled guilty to third-degree 

murder and conspiracy on September 30, 2011.  That same day, the trial court 

imposed  the  agreed-upon  sentence  of  seventeen  and  a  half  to  forty  years’ 

incarceration.  Appellant did not file post-sentence motions or a direct appeal.   

J-S43043-22  

____________________________________________ 

1 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9541-9546. 
 

  

J-S43043-22 

 

Appellant filed his first pro se PCRA petition on November 16, 2016.  The 

PCRA  court  appointed  counsel,  who  filed  a  Turner/Finley2  petition  on 

Appellant’s  behalf.    The  PCRA  court  ultimately  dismissed  Appellant’s  PCRA 

petition as untimely and granted PCRA counsel leave to withdraw.  See PCRA 

Ct. Order, 3/27/15.  On appeal, this Court affirmed.  See Commonwealth v. 

Madison, 2357 EDA 2017, 2018 WL 3015266 (Pa. Super. filed June 18, 2018) 

(unpublished mem.).   

 

On February 10, 2022, Appellant filed the instant pro se PCRA petition, 

his second.  See PCRA Pet., 2/10/22; Brief in Support of PCRA Pet., 2/10/22.  

Therein, Appellant claimed that he met the newly discovered fact exception to 

the PCRA time bar based on exculpatory evidence that was “not available until 

2021 and did not come to light until after [he] pled guilty.”  Brief in Support 

of PCRA Pet. at 5. 

On March 25, 2022, the PCRA court issued a Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 notice of 

intent  to dismiss Appellant’s untimely  petition without a  hearing.  Appellant 

filed a pro se response in which he abandoned his newly discovered fact claim 

and argued that his petition was timely under the governmental interference 

exception to the PCRA time bar.  On May 15, 2022, the PCRA court issued an 

order dismissing Appellant’s petition.   

 

Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and a court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 

1925(b) statement.  The PCRA court issued an opinion in which it concluded 

____________________________________________ 

2 Commonwealth v. Turner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa. 1988); Commonwealth v. 
Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa. Super. 1988) (en banc).

J-S43043-22 

that Appellant had failed to establish any exception to the PCRA time bar.  See 

PCRA Ct. Op. at 4-5. 

On appeal, Appellant raises the following claims: 

1.  Did the PCRA court err by not fairly reviewing [A]ppellant’s PCRA 
petition issues based on: (1) the government interference claim 
under  42  Pa.C.S.  §  9545(b)(1)(i);  and  (2)  [A]ppellant  being 
denied  due  process 
in  accordance  with  the  [Fourteenth 
Amendment of the United States Constitution]? 

2.  Was the PCRA court’s determination of “untimely,” fairly assessed 
in  evaluating  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  where  the 
government  interference  was  based  on  a  Brady[3]  violation, 
contrary to the due process clause of the [Fourteenth Amendment 
of the United States Constitution]? 

3.  Did the PCRA court err and cause prejudice to [A]ppellant’s due 
process rights by not fairly reviewing [A]ppellant’s claims that the 
prosecution  did  not  disclose  Brady  materials  based  on  ballistic, 
forensic, and DNA evidence, that was withheld (which would have 
resulted in a different outcome), in violation of [A]ppellant’s rights 
secured under the [Fourteenth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution]? 

4.  Did the PCRA court err by not reviewing the trial court’s records 
as to whether the court violated Appellant’s rights based on the 
non-disclosure  claim,  pertaining  to  Brady  materials  requested, 
which was denied by the prosecution, in violation of [A]ppellant’s 
due process rights secured under the [Fourteenth Amendment of 
the United States Constitution]? 

5.  Did  the  PCRA  court  erroneously  apply  an  incorrect  exception 
under  42  Pa.C.S.  §  9545(b)(1)(ii);  instead  of  42  Pa.C.S.  § 
9545(b)(1)(i),  government  interference  (where  under  that 
exception, [A]ppellant has to prove due-diligence or assert when 
the  after  discovered  exculpatory  evidence  became  available  to 
him), which violated his burden of proof that shifts the proof under 
42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(ii)? 

____________________________________________ 

3 See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). 

- 3 - 

J-S43043-22 

6.  Did the PCRA court err by applying due-diligence pursuant to 42 
Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(i), and by “time barring” [A]ppellant when 
the  prosecution  never  disclosed  Brady  material,  in  violation  of 
[A]ppellant’s  due  process  rights  secured  under  the  [Fourteenth 
Amendment of the United States Constitution]? 

7.  Did the PCRA court err by not ruling on disclosure at the pre-trial 
stage where the court denied all request without a hearing, which 
caused prejudice upon [A]ppellant, in violation of his due process 
rights  secured  under  the  [Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  United 
States Constitution]? 

8.  Did the PCRA court commit reversible error, or abuse its discretion 
by alleging that the PCRA petition was “untimely,” based on added 
elements  to  the  Brady  exception,  by  requiring  [A]ppellant  to 
prove due-diligence under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(i)? 

9.  Did  the  PCRA court err by  ignoring or  refusing  to render  a final 
decision  based  on  the  disclosure  of  Brady  materials  requested, 
regarding  ballistic,  forensic,  and  DNA  results,  that  resulted  in  a 
manifest injustice and prejudice, in violation of [A]ppellant’s due 
process rights secured under the [Fourteenth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution]? 

Appellant’s Brief at 2-3 (some formatting altered). 

In reviewing an order denying a PCRA petition, our standard of review 

is well settled: 

[O]ur  standard  of  review  from  the  denial  of  a  PCRA  petition  is 
limited  to  examining  whether  the  PCRA  court’s  determination  is 
supported by the evidence of record and whether it is free of legal 
error.    The  PCRA  court’s  credibility  determinations,  when 
supported by the record, are binding on this Court; however, we 
apply  a  de  novo  standard  of  review  to  the  PCRA  court’s  legal 
conclusions. 

Commonwealth  v.  Sandusky,  203  A.3d  1033,  1043  (Pa.  Super.  2019) 

(citations omitted and formatting altered). 

- 4 - 

J-S43043-22 

The timeliness of a PCRA petition is a threshold jurisdictional question.  

See Commonwealth v. Miller, 102 A.3d 988, 992 (Pa. Super. 2014); see 

also Commonwealth v. Ballance, 203 A.3d 1027, 1031 (Pa. Super. 2019) 

(stating  that  “no  court  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  an  untimely  PCRA  petition” 

(citation omitted)).  “A PCRA petition, including a second or subsequent one, 

must be filed within one year of the date the petitioner’s judgment of sentence 

became final, unless he pleads and proves one of the three exceptions outlined 

in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1).”  Commonwealth v. Jones, 54 A.3d 14, 16 (Pa. 

2012) (citation and footnote omitted).  A judgment of sentence becomes final 

at the conclusion of direct review, or at the expiration of time for seeking such 

review.  See id. at 17.   

Courts may consider a PCRA petition filed more than one year after a 

judgment of sentence becomes final if the petitioner pleads and proves one of 

the following three statutory exceptions: 

(i)  the  failure  to  raise  the  claim  previously  was  the  result  of 
interference by government officials with the presentation of the 
claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth 
or the Constitution or laws of the United States; 

(ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to 
the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise 
of due diligence; or 

(iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized 
by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court 
of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and 
has been held by that court to apply retroactively. 

- 5 - 

42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).  A petitioner asserting one of these exceptions 

must file a petition within one year of the date the claim could have first been 

presented.  See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2).4  It is the petitioner’s “burden to 

allege  and  prove  that  one  of  the  timeliness  exceptions  applies.” 

Commonwealth  v.  Albrecht,  994  A.2d  1091,  1094  (Pa.  2010)  (citations 

omitted and some formatting altered). 

Here,  Appellant’s  judgment  of  sentence  became  final  on  October  31, 

2011,  the  date  on  which  the  time  to  file  a  direct  appeal  expired.5    See  42 

Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3) (stating that the judgment of sentence becomes final at 

the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking the 

review);  Pa.R.A.P.  903(c)(3)  (requiring  that  when  no  post-sentence  motion 

has been filed, a notice of appeal to Superior Court must be filed within thirty 

days  of  the  imposition  of  the  judgment  of  sentence  in  open  court). 

Accordingly, the deadline to file a timely PCRA petition was October 31, 2012.  

See  42  Pa.C.S.  §  9545(b)(1).    Appellant’s  instant  PCRA  petition,  filed  on 

February 10, 2022, is therefore facially untimely.   

4 On October 24, 2018, the General Assembly amended Section 9545(b)(2) 
and extended the time for filing a petition from sixty days to one year from 
the date the claim could have been presented.  See 2018 Pa.Legis.Serv.Act 
2018-146 (S.B. 915), effective December 24, 2018.  The amendment applies 
only  to  claims  arising  one  year  before  the  effective  date  of  this  section, 
December 24, 2017, or thereafter.  

 The thirtieth day actually fell on Sunday, October 30, 2011, and it is excluded 
from the calculation of time.  See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1908.

J-S43043-22 

Appellant argues that he met the government interference exception to 

the PCRA time bar.6,7  Appellant’s Brief at 10.  Specifically, Appellant contends 

that the Commonwealth “withheld Brady [m]aterials favorable to Appellant, 

that was based on ballistic evidence, and a forensic analysis report that the 

prosecution alleges ‘was not available,’ or ‘wasn’t in their possession’ during 

the pre-trial stage.”  Id.  Appellant argues that he did not become aware of 

the Commonwealth’s alleged “misconduct until sometime in 2021, when [he] 

filed  a  motion  to  obtain  information  concerning  forensic  evidence  with  the 

State  Police  under  the  ‘Right  to  Know  Law,’”  which  was  subsequently 

forwarded to the trial court and denied on November 19, 2021.  Id.  Further, 

although  Appellant  claims  that  he  “has  indeed  exercised  due[]diligence 

throughout  all  criminal  procedures,”  he  argues  that  the  Commonwealth’s 

failure  to  disclose  Brady  materials  “negates  any  due  diligence  obligations 

upon [A]ppellant[.]”  Id. at 10, 13.  Therefore, Appellant concludes that his 

6 As noted previously, although this claim was not included in Appellant’s pro 
se PCRA petition, Appellant did raise the government interference exception 
in his response to the PCRA court’s Rule 907 notice. 

  We  note  that  although  Appellant  lists  nine  issues  in  his  statement  of 
questions, he only includes one argument section in his brief.  See Pa.R.A.P. 
2119(a)  (stating  that  the  argument  section  of  an  appellate  brief  “shall  be 
divided into as many parts as there are questions to be argued; and shall have 
at the head of each part—in distinctive type or in type distinctively displayed—
the particular point treated therein, followed by such discussion and citation 
of authorities as are deemed pertinent”).  However, it is clear that Appellant’s 
primary  claim  is  that  he  met  the  government  interference  exception  to  the 
PCRA  time  bar.    Therefore,  because  the  defects  in  Appellant’s  brief  do  not 
hamper our review of that claim, we decline to find the issue waived.

prong[.]”  Id. at 13-14. 

instant PCRA petition was timely and that he “has satisfied the due diligence 

The  Commonwealth  responds  that  Appellant  “utterly  fails  to  address 

how the [timeliness] exception is actually applicable” and instead “spends the 

majority of his brief arguing the actual merits of Brady claim, which is wholly 

irrelevant to the issue of the timeliness of his petition.”  Commonwealth’s Brief 

at 10.  In any event, the Commonwealth emphasizes that Appellant received 

the alleged Brady materials prior to entering his guilty plea, which is reflected 

in the record from the preliminary hearing, pre-trial motions hearing, and plea 

hearing.    Id.  at  11-13.    With  respect  to  due  diligence,  the  Commonwealth 

notes  that  although  Appellant  knew  that  the  ballistic  and  forensic  reports 

existed in 2011, he offers no explanation as to why he waited until 2021 to 

request  copies.    Id.  at  14.    Therefore,  the  Commonwealth  argues  that 

Appellant has failed to establish a timeliness exception and is not entitled to 

relief. 

It is well settled that a Brady claim may fall within the governmental 

interference  and  newly  discovered  fact  exceptions  to  the  PCRA  time  bar.  

Commonwealth v. Natividad, 200 A.3d 11, 28 (Pa. 2019).  To raise a Brady 

claim  in  the  context  of  Section  9545(b)(1)(i)’s  “governmental  interference 

exception, the petitioner must plead and prove the failure to previously raise 

the  claim  was  the  result  of  interference  by  government  officials,  and  the 

information  could  not  have  been  obtained  earlier  with  the  exercise  of  due 

diligence.”  Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 941 A.2d 1263, 1268 (Pa. 2008) 

- 8 - 

J-S43043-22 

(citation omitted).  Due diligence requires that the petitioner take reasonable 

steps to protect his own interests.  Commonwealth v. Brown, 111 A.3d 171, 

176 (Pa. Super. 2015).  Further, the merits of the underlying Brady claim are 

irrelevant when determining whether a petitioner has established a timeliness 

exception.  Abu-Jamal, 941 A.2d at 1268. 

Here,  as  noted  previously,  the  PCRA  court  concluded  that  Appellant 

failed  to  establish  the  government  interference  exception  to  the  PCRA  time 

bar.  See PCRA Ct. Op. at 3-4.  Specifically, the PCRA court explained: 

In his [Rule] 907 response, [Appellant] now alleges his petition is 
timely  because  the  failure  to  raise  the  claim  previously  was  the 
result of interference by government officials. Again, [Appellant] 
makes  nothing  other  than  boilerplate  allegations  to  support  this 
claim.  Accordingly, [Appellant’s] PCRA petition is untimely.  As a 
result, this [c]ourt lacks jurisdiction to entertain his petition. 

Id. at 5. 

Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the PCRA court’s 

conclusion is supported by the record and free of legal error.  See Sandusky, 

203 A.3d at 1043.  Appellant has failed to demonstrate that his failure to raise 

the  underlying  Brady  claim  earlier  was  the  result  of  interference  by 

government officials.  See Abu-Jamal, 941 A.2d at 1268.  Further, although 

the record reflects that Appellant was aware of the alleged Brady materials 

at the time his criminal proceedings began in 2011, Appellant does not explain 

- 9 - 

J-S43043-22 

why he failed to obtain copies of the reports until 2021.8  Therefore, Appellant 

has failed to demonstrate that the information could not have been obtained 

earlier with the exercise of due diligence.  See id.  On this record, we agree 

with the PCRA court that Appellant’s petition was untimely and that he failed 

to prove the governmental interference exception to the PCRA time bar.  See 

id.  Accordingly, we affirm. 

Order affirmed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
