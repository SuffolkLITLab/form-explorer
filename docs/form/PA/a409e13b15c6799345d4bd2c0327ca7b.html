One  of  the  primary  administrative  functions 
of  the  Pennsylvania  courts  is  to  ensure  that 
defendants 
responsible 
individuals carry through on the obligations 
to  pay  costs,  fines,  and  restitution  on  their 
cases.  This  guide  will  introduce  you  to  the 
different  methods  of  collection  available  to 
the  Pennsylvania  courts  that  are  managed 
through 
Judge 
the  Magisterial  District 
System  (MDJS)  and  Common  Pleas  Case 
Management  System  (CPCMS)  computer 
applications.  

W H A T   A R E    
M D J S   A N D   C P C M S ?  

The Magisterial District Judge System (MDJS) and 
Common  Pleas  Case  Management  System 
(CPCMS)  are  the  computer  systems  used  by  the 
Magisterial  District  and  Common  Pleas  Courts. 
The systems were created at the discretion of the 
Supreme  Court  of  Pennsylvania  by 
the 
Administrative  Office  of  Pennsylvania  Courts 
(AOPC)  to  record  and  track  the  business  of  the 
courts.  

ore than systems for recording docket numbers, 
these are case management systems that provide 
judges,  court  staff,  probation,  accounting  and 
other  departments  with  case  administration, 
reporting, and accounting functions. With regards 
to  collections  in  particular,  MDJS  and  CPCMS 
provide  functions  to  record  assessments,  receipt 
create  payment  plans,  manage 
payments, 
delinquent  accounts  and 
follow  up  with 
enforcement  measures.  The  systems  also  interact 
with  other  state  and  federal  criminal  justice 
systems, providing information to a wide range of 
agencies and officials.  

 M

The case management systems provide court staff 
with  the  ability  to  monitor  payments  made  on 
cases  and  manage  delinquent  accounts  through 
the use of a wide range of reports. Three different 
types of reports are available: 

Payment Reports: 
Payment  reports  are  used  to  monitor  information 
about  active  payment  plans,  payments  made 
against them, and find assessments that are not on 
payment plans. 

nforcement Reports: 

Enforcement  reports  can  identify  payment  plans 
that  are  overdue  and  are  used  by  the  courts  to 
take proactive measures. 

ollection Agency Reports: 

Collection  Agency  reports  are  used  to  monitor 
payment  plans  referred  to  collections  and  view 
payments made on referred payment plans.

Court  staff  can  use  MDJS  or  CPCMS  to  track  the  payment  schedules  for  all  remitters  in  order  to  monitor  for  payment 
delinquency. These systems also provide tools that are used to notify the remitters that they need to bring their accounts up to 
date. 

verdue Payment Notices 

At the Magisterial District Courts, MDJS will automatically generate lists that prompt the court to take action when payments are 
late. These lists are used to generate overdue payment notices for the responsible remitters to inform them that a warrant may 
be issued, their license may be suspended, or, for juveniles, their case will be transferred to Common Pleas for further action, if 
payment is not made within a specified time period. 

n CPCMS, Common Pleas court staff can utilize any of three overdue payment notices that can be sent periodically when the 
responsible individual fails to remit. These letters indicate that payments are past due and requests that they be brought up to 
date or paid in full. As matters escalate, a collections letter is available to inform individuals that they are being referred to a 
collection  agency.  The  value  of  overdue  payment  notices  is  that  they  give  the  remitter  the  opportunity  to  resume  timely 
payments or, alternatively, attend a hearing in order to avoid additional enforcement actions. 

earings 

Hearings may be held before a judge when other measures have failed to procure payment from the responsible remitter. At a 
hearing,  this  individual  works  with  the  judge  to  establish  a  payment  plan,  if  one  was  not  previously  created,  or  make  any 
modifications to an existing plan to make it possible for the individual to make timely payments. Failure to appear for a hearing 
can result in a warrant being issued for the remitter or referral to a collection agency. 

n the Court of Common Pleas, hearings for payment delinquency may also be held before a probation officer, as a preemptive 
enforcement measure, since nonpayment is a violation of the conditions of probation.  

DJS  and  CPCMS  help  facilitate  hearings  by  allowing  court  staff  to  schedule  the  hearings  on  the  court  calendar,  produce 

hearing notices, and record the outcome of the hearing.  

A P P L Y I N G   A D D I T I O N A L   E N F O R C E M E N T   M E A S U R E S  

If  an  individual  with  an  outstanding  case  balance  cannot  be  located  or  refuses  to  remit,  the  courts  may  choose  additional 
enforcement measures. 

Both the Magisterial District and Common Pleas courts can issue driver license suspensions as a consequence to nonpayment 
and both case management systems can produce notices that warn of this potential action. If the defendant fails to respond to 
the notice, the courts can request license suspensions from PennDOT.  

icense Suspension 

arrants 

 W

Warrants can also be issued through MDJS and CPCMS for nonpayment in order to compel the individual to appear before a 
judge.  Warrants  increase  the  likelihood  of  the  individual  being  found  because,  for  those  cases  that  apply,  MDJS  and  CPCMS 
transmit  warrant  information  to  the  state  and  national  databases  used  by  law  enforcement.    When  the  individual  is  brought 
before the court, the judge can determine additional sanctions and remedies. 

ollection Agencies 

The courts may also choose to use collection agencies in order to locate responsible remitters and obtain payment. Courts often 
choose  to  use  a  collection  agency  because  the  third-party  program  can  be  instituted  at  no  cost,  since  collection  fees  are 
assessed against the responsible remitter, and require less management and fewer court resources. County court offices can also 
use more than one collection agency in an attempt to escalate the collection methods used to obtain payment. In CPCMS, the 
process  for  referring  payment  plans  to  collections  can  be  automated  to  allow  data  to  be  sent  electronically  to  collection 
agencies.

The  courts  offer,  or  may  require,  additional  payment 
options  that  can  be  utilized  to  make  the  remittance 
process  more  practical  for  individuals  with  a  case 
balance. 

Depending  on  the  sum  of  fines,  costs,  and  restitution 
levied on a case, an individual may not be able to remit 
the  payment  amount  in  a  single  lump  sum.  To  assist 
these  individuals  with  the  challenge  of  repaying  these 
assessments, a remitter can work with court staff or the 
judge  to  determine  a  periodic  payment  schedule  that 
fits within their financial means. This agreement, referred 
to  as  a  payment  plan,  is  then  recorded  by  the  court  in 
the  case  management  system  to  provide  a  systematic 
way  to  track  payment  amounts  and  due  dates.  For 
individuals who owe money on multiple cases, payment 
plans  can  also  be  used  to  consolidate  those  separate 
assessments  so  payments  can  be  remitted  for  all 
outstanding  debts 
simultaneously.  All  payments 
recorded  on  a  payment  plan  are  automatically  applied 
by the case management systems according to the UDS.

AePay 

 P

PAePay is a service provided on the UJS Portal that can 
be used to make payments on a case or payment plan, 
via  the  internet,  with  a  credit  or  debit  card.  PAePay  is 
highly convenient to defendants because it is a 24-hour 
a day service that eliminates the need to pay by mail or 
at  a  court  office.  PAePay  is  used  by  all  Magisterial 
District  and  Common  Pleas  Courts  across  the  state  and 
is  systematically  integrated  with  MDJS  and  CPCMS  so 
these  electronic  payments  can  be  applied  to  the 
appropriate cases or payment plans.

recording 

Fines, costs, and restitution are frequently ordered by 
a judge when an individual has entered a guilty plea 
or has been found guilty of an offense. These orders 
are then passed on to court staff who are responsible 
for 
any 
accompanying  monetary  assessments.  The  case 
management  systems  used  by 
for 
recording 
information,  MDJS  and  CPCMS, 
provide  numerous  fiscal  functions  that  manage  and 
track  all  court-levied  assessments  and  generate  the 
corresponding  receipts.  The 
flexibility  of  these 
systems  provide  the  courts  multiple  ways  to  accept 
payment  and,  conversely,  to  facilitate  payment  if  an 
individual fails to remit.

balance, cash, checks, and money orders are some of 
the  more  common  methods  of  remittance.  For  each 
of  these  methods,  the  remitter  can  mail  their 
payment to the court or make payment in person at 
the  court  office.  In  these  instances,  the  court  can 
record  their  payment  in  the  case  management 
system  and  produce  a  receipt  for  the  remitter.  Any 
payment  recorded  on  a  case  will  automatically  be 
applied to the assessments on the case according to 
the Uniform Disbursement Schedule (UDS). However, 
if  these  payment  methods  or  the  overall  payment 
amount  is  prohibitive  to  the  remitter,  alternative 
methods are available.

What is the UDS? 
The UDS was instituted by the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court  to  direct  the  disbursement  of  all  fines,  fees, 
costs,  penalties  and  restitution.  The  established 
disbursement  schedule 
in  compliance  with 
legislation  that  gives  priority  to  the  payment  of 
victims and collection agency fees. The UDS ensures 
that  payments  are  disbursed  appropriately  on  all 
cases.
