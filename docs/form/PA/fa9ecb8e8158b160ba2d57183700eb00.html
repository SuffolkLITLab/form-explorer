Wiping the 
slate clean

The Clean Slate Law, designed to automatically 
seal certain criminal history data, goes into 
effect in Pennsylvania this summer.

(continued on page 2)

Wiping the slate clean 

By Josh Wilson

Last session, legislation creating the 
“Clean Slate Law” passed the General 
Assembly by an overwhelmingly 
bipartisan vote and was signed into 
law by Gov. Tom Wolf.

This new law is designed to 
automatically seal certain criminal 
history information.  It goes into effect 
this summer and is the first program-of-
its-kind in the nation.

Under this new protocol, criminal 
history record information pertaining 
to eligible “non-violent” criminal and 
summary records and non-conviction 
records will be automatically shielded 
from public view. 

Individuals will need to have 

been free from conviction of 

offenses punishable by a year 

or more in prison for 10 years, 

and have completed all court-

ordered obligations.  

Implementation of the new law is rather 
complicated and won’t be achieved 
through a simple flip of the switch.

Access (as provided in Act 5 of 2016), 
which was expanded in December of 
last year.

The ability for the commonwealth to 
automatically seal eligible records is 
accomplished in large part through the 
efforts of AOPC/IT, in consultation with 
the Pennsylvania State Police— who 
maintain the state’s official criminal 
history repository.

“AOPC and the Pennsylvania State 
Police have worked cooperatively to 
effectively create complex mechanisms 
to identify and verify the cases 
and offenses that will be subject to 
automatic sealing under the Clean 
Slate law,” said Amy Ceraso, director 
of AOPC/IT. 

The Pennsylvania Bar Association 
and Community Legal Services 
have partnered to provide free legal 
consultation to Pennsylvanians to 
help determine if they are eligible for 
these provisions. “My Clean Slate” can 
be accessed via https://clsphila.org/
mycleanslatepa. 

Additionally, AOPC recently designed 
a webpage that details the various 
provisions of the new law and 
outlines the basics of criminal history 
information, including background 
checks and the expungement of 
records. 

“Processing the enormous backlog of 
cases that are eligible for Clean Slate 
treatment over the next year will be 
a challenge, but with the assistance 
of county judicial officials and Clerks 
of Courts, we are confident that we’ll 
be able to identify and seal millions of 
cases to meet the stated purpose of 
the Clean Slate act,” added Ceraso.

It is important to note, these records 
will not be expunged, and will still be 
accessible to law enforcement and 
judicial officers.

in effect – specifically, the list of

Improving 
writing skills 
for judicial 
professionals

Contributors: Don Powers, Christy Beane 
and Mark Singer 

Pennsylvania Association of Court Management (PACM) 
board members along with AOPC/Judicial District 
Operations staff went back to school to take a crash course 
in “Writing Skills for Judicial Professionals.”

Professor Ronald R. Hofer, a distinguished professor at 
the National Judicial College in Reno, Nevada, led the 
professional development workshop.

“Ship sails tomorrow.” Ask yourself, what does this mean? 

You are likely thinking that it means the boat leaves the 
dock tomorrow. However, according to Professor Hofer, 
this was actually a note from a manager to an employee 
reminding them to ship (mail) the boat’s sails to the 
customer tomorrow. 

He reminded participants not to leave inferences for 
your readership to fill in, otherwise confusion and 
misinterpretation of the written word will occur. 

Professor Hofer told participants jokingly about “Hofer’s 
Rule of Confusion”—the idea that every time you read a 
sentence that you can’t get your head around, it is usually 
because the actor is not defined. 

“Your writing gets better when you say who (actor) is doing 
what (action),” said Hofer. 

“When deciding what message you want to send through 
your writing, focus on information that is important to the 
reader, not what is important to the writer,” Christy Beane, 
assistant director of AOPC/Judicial District Operations noted 
as an important takeaway from the session. 

The goal of the workshop was to provide the tools to make 
writing more readable and easier to understand. 

Writing is a skill used by staff every day, and yet for most, it 
has been decades since participating in a writing course. 

Weeks before the course, each attendee was asked to 
submit writing samples to be discussed and dissected 
during the workshop. 

Although this was a simple task on the surface, most found 
it difficult to find the best writing samples that they were 
willing to submit for inspection.

“When I received the invitation to attend the effective 
writing course, I knew I had to accept,” said Don Powers, 
district court administrator in Clinton County.

The last time I consciously diagramed a sentence was 1976 
and I was nervous about attending this workshop. As it 
happens, there was nothing for me to be nervous about.”

Throughout the workshop, class participants were reminded 
about the difference between active and passive voice, 
how to identify and avoid nominalizations and expletives, 
and how to identify the subject, verb and object in each 
sentence.

“Never pass up an 
opportunity to grow 
your knowledge.” 
– Don Powers, Clinton County district 
court administrator 

According to Mark Singer, district court administrator for 
Franklin/Fulton counties, Professor Hofer taught a “hands-
on, four-step editing process that was easy to comprehend. 
This was a practical application that can be used in daily 
writing.” 

Powers shared that “the proofreading part of the curriculum 
was of greatest interest to me. I guarantee that I’ll be a 
stronger editor after this course.” 

“This conference was one of the best experiences I’ve 
had outside of my courthouse since I became DCA,” said 
Powers. “Never pass up an opportunity to grow your 
knowledge.”  

Four-step guide to edit  
your own writing

1.  Draw circles around the  
 

passive verbs. 

2.  Draw boxes around expletives. 

3.  Underline the nominalizations. 

4.  Note the distance between  
 

subject and verb.

Q & A: Comfort dogs and their handlers

While going to court can often be a difficult and nerve-
racking experience for many people, especially children, 
some courts have found a way to help ease the stress.

Both Monroe and Lycoming Counties have received 
adorable additions to their courthouse staff and agree 
that the presence of comfort dogs in their courts has been 
nothing but overwhelmingly positive.

Four-year-old Jedi, a Labrador/Golden Retriever mix, 
joined Lycoming County’s court staff back in February of 
2018, where he was matched with his handler, Jerri Rook, 
executive secretary to Judge Joy Reynolds McCoy.

Meanwhile, in Monroe County, two-year-old Golden 
Retriever mix, Nicholas (Nick) is a rather recent addition 
having only begun this past February but he has already 
stolen the hearts of everyone there – including his handler, 
Chief Law Clerk Jessica Jones. 

Q: What is your favorite part about being your dog’s 
handler?

Jones: “My favorite part of having Nicholas in my life is 
seeing the smiles he brings to everyone he meets. He has 
such a happy and social personality! Sometimes that means 
it takes me much longer to get from point A to point B now, 
but I’m happy to let him greet everyone we meet because 
it’s just so uplifting to see the joy he brings to people.” 

Rook: “The best part is seeing the faces of the children light 
up when he walks into a room. The children that come into 
court generally are nervous and scared.  When they see 
Jedi, all that disappears and they are just excited to see a 
dog.”

Q: Can you recall a particularly moving experience when 
you saw your dog make a real difference?

Jones: “I remember one child that Nick interacted with 
recently who was quite withdrawn when Nick met him. After 
asking the child if he wanted to sit with Nick and getting a 
shoulder shrug, I had Nick sit up on a bench seat and the 
child sat down next to him. 

Before long, the child was simply sitting and petting Nick. 
Eventually, Nick put his head in the child’s lap and stayed 
there for close to an hour. The child started to smile and 
talk, which was a complete turn-around from his demeanor 
before.” 

We asked both handlers a few questions about their 
experiences with their new best friends:

Q: What is the difference between being an owner and a 
handler?

Jones: “I think one notable difference between being a 
handler and an owner is educating the people we come into 
contact with. As a handler, I am not only representing myself 
and my pet dog, like I would as an owner, but I am also 
representing the wider service dog community. By providing 
information and education for people we come into contact 
with, Nick and I are, hopefully, making a positive impact on 
our local community on behalf of service dogs everywhere.”

Rook: “I feel like I’m missing something when he’s not 
with me. I’m more aware of things that may affect him and 
how the public reacts to him and treats him. I have to pay 
attention to where his feet are, where his tail is, holding 
doors open to make sure he gets through before it closes, 
what’s on the ground, etc.”

Rook: “I can tell you my first moving experience with Jedi 
was with a 15-year-old juvenile delinquent. He was very 
distraught, crying and hyperventilating. When Jedi and I first 
walked in, he yelled at us that he did not want us there. I 
calmly took Jedi over and laid him at the juvenile’s feet and 
could immediately feel that the juvenile was starting to relax 
a little.

After a few minutes of petting Jedi, the juvenile was 
completely calmed down. His crying had stopped. When 
they took the juvenile out, he went with the officers without 

incident and was completely calmed down.  We have sat 
with many juveniles over the past year, but this, by far, was 
the most moving experience I have had.”

Would you recommend comfort dogs to other 
courthouses?

Jones: “Absolutely. I hope that in the future, all courthouses 
have a facility dog available for their visitors, staff, victims 
and children.”

Remaining Vigilant 

By Darren Breslin, Esq. 

Next year will mark the 15th anniversary of the Pennsylvania Commission 
on Judicial Independence (“the Commission”). 

The Commission is a non-partisan advisory group reporting to the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Its mission was, and remains, simple: to help 
educate the public about the importance of fair and impartial courts in our 
society. 

Since its inception under the leadership of then-Chief Justice Ralph 
Cappy, the Commission has both led and supported numerous initiatives, 
highlighting the critical importance of an independent judiciary. 

Over the past 14 years, the Commission has featured prestigious events 
across the commonwealth, featuring speakers renowned for their work, 
both nationally and internationally.

In delivering its message, the Commission has hosted prominent speakers, 
most notably, former Associate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day 
O’Connor, to talk about the importance of fair and impartial courts. 

In addition to developing lesson plans for teachers across the 
commonwealth to aid in the teaching of civics, the Commission has also 
hosted numerous lectures and programs.

Some of these include such diverse topics as court-media relations; 
the necessity of adequately funding the courts; and a program 
commemorating the sesquicentennial of the Second Founding, marking 
the 150th anniversary of the Reconstruction Amendments after the Civil 
War. 

In 2019 the Commission remains a vibrant and engaged body. Under 
the leadership of Federal Judge John E. Jones, III, and Commonwealth 
Court Judge Renée Cohn Jubelirer, the Commission members remain 
vigilant, watching for unjust attacks against the judiciary, and also helping 
to educate the citizens of Pennsylvania about the importance of fair and 
impartial courts in our society.

Education for guardians 

by Cherstin Hamel

Imagine you are appointed by the 
court to serve as a guardian for an 
older family member or friend who can 
no longer make their own decisions. 

If you aren’t an attorney or a 
“professional” guardian, you might be 
asking, “Where can I find information 
about my role as a guardian?”

The Elder Law Task Force convened by 
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 
2013 recognized there is little guidance 
for non-attorney guardians about their 
powers, duties and responsibilities.

As a result, they recommended that 
these guardians be given written and 
oral instructions at the time of their 
appointment, and that free training and 
online resources be developed by the 
Office of Elder Justice in the Courts 
(OEJC).

In 2018, the OEJC began piloting a free 
training program for guardians titled, 
“Fundamentals of Guardianship: What 
Family Guardians Need to Know.” 

The training program is designed to 
help guardians better understand their 
responsibilities by providing them 
with the resources and tools needed 
to carry out their duties, and then 
allowing them to ask questions. 

In May, the training program was 
offered in the following counties: 
Carbon, Somerset, Allegheny, 
Venango, Elk and Cameron Counties.  

“While guardians 
will be a target 
audience for 
education, the 
true beneficiaries 
will be adults 
with physical 
or mental 
disabilities . . .”
– Katherine C. Pearson, Esq., 
professor of law at Penn State 
University’s Dickinson School of Law

The OEJC is pleased to announce it 
is also collaborating with Penn State 
University on a new educational 
endeavor - the Pennsylvania Adult-
Fiduciary Education Project.

Through the efforts of Katherine C. 
Pearson, Esq., professor of law at 
Penn State University’s Dickinson 
School of Law, a grant award was 
obtained in January to develop online 
educational modules for use with 
current or prospective guardians, and 
for similar agents serving disabled, frail 
or vulnerable adults. 

“While guardians will be a target 
audience for education, the true 

beneficiaries will be adults with 
physical or mental disabilities, 
especially adults with neurocognitive 
impairments that may increase with 
age,” said Professor Pearson. “By 
developing the highest quality program 
to inform and evaluate agents and 
guardians for incapacitated adults 
in Pennsylvania, we can shape a 
national educational model, and 
promote greater safety, well-being and 
enhanced quality of life for adults in 
need of assistance.”

Over the next 18 months, a team of 
experts from Dickinson Law School, 
Penn State’s Colleges of Nursing and 
Medicine, Penn State Harrisburg, the 
Pennsylvania Association of Elder Law 
Attorneys, the ARC of Pennsylvania, 
SeniorLAW Center and Community 
Legal Services, Superior Court Judge 
Paula Francisco Ott (as chair of the 
Advisory Council on Elder Justice in 
the Courts) and the OEJC will create 
educational modules that address an 
array of topics useful to guardians. 

The OEJC and Advisory Council on 
Elder Justice in the Courts are gratified 
that Penn State reached out to the 
court system to propose this rewarding 
collaboration and look forward to 
reviewing the tools to be created.

Elder Justice in the Courts)

Video highlights from PA’s 
women on the bench

In honor of Women’s History Month in March, the AOPC produced 
a Q&A video series highlighting some of our female judges in 
Pennsylvania. The video is a wonderful representation and highlight 
of women on the Supreme, Superior and Commonwealth Courts – as 
well as president judges who oversee the Court of Common Pleas and 
Magisterial District Courts. Watch the video at pacourts.us/news-and-

Judge Susan Schwab.

Journey to citizenship

Steve Grey, an AOPC systems analyst, celebrated 
a significant milestone this past April as he officially 
became a U.S. citizen. 

New leadership for 
AOPC judicial district 
security team 

Grey was born in England, but grew up in New Zealand 
after his family moved there when he was six years old. 

In 1991, he traveled to Japan to teach English for 
two years where he met a girl from Mechanicsburg, 
Pennsylvania. 

A few years later, the two got married and moved to New 
Zealand before eventually deciding to move back to his 
wife’s hometown in 1995 when he was thirty years old. 

When asked how long it took him to become an official 
U.S. citizen, Grey said he only began the process last 
year.

“I was surprised how fast the whole process went for me,” 
Grey explained. “It can sometimes take years, but I have 
been a permanent resident in the states since 1995, so 
I already qualified – just had to fill out all the forms and 
pass the test.”

This June, Grey and his wife will celebrate their 25th 
anniversary with a trip back to Japan where they first met 
– this time bringing along their two daughters. 

When asked what made him want to finally become 
a U.S. citizen, Grey said his green card is expiring in 
November and he knows his future lays in the U.S.  

“I have now lived in the United States longer than I have 
lived in any other country. My family is settled, I like my 
job and I have good friends,” said Grey. 

Magisterial District Judge Susan E. Schwab oversaw 
the ceremony where 50 immigrants from 25 countries 
became U.S. citizens that day.

The AOPC was pleased to welcome Rob Granzow as 
its new Judicial District Security administrator at the end 
of May. Rob succeeds Mary Beth Marschik who retired 
on June 7 after nearly 15 years of dedicated service with 
AOPC and 35 years of state government service.

Rob comes to the AOPC with an incredibly diverse 
background. Prior to his appointment, Rob held senior 
and global corporate security assignments at both TE 
Connectivity and AMP Incorporated. 

Before that, he served as both the chair and professor of 
the Division of Law and Science at Central Pennsylvania 
College. 

In his early career, Rob was a municipal police officer 
who served in both the U.S. Naval Reserve and the 
Pennsylvania Army National Guard as a military police 
investigator. 

Rob holds a bachelor’s degree from York College and 
earned his master’s degree in criminal justice from St. 
Joseph’s University.  

Additionally, Kyle Ramberger has been promoted to 
Judicial District Security assistant administrator following 
14 years of impressive performance in his former security 
roles at the AOPC – most recently as Judicial District 
Security analyst. 

Please join us in congratulating Kyle and welcoming Rob 
to the AOPC.

Can we improve court collections?

Last year, a Collection Agency Task Force was established to determine if a 
statewide collection agency contract would be beneficial to county courts to 
help improve the courts’ collection of fines, fees and restitution.

After a survey of district court administrators across the state, it was concluded 
that offering a statewide collection agency solution would be of value. 

Following a competitive selection process, the AOPC secured a statewide 
contract with a private collection agency – Alliance One. 

“AOPC was looking for a vendor with general and court collections experience, 
while trying to minimize fees charged to defendants by the agency,” said Amy 
Ceraso, director of AOPC/IT. 

The AOPC is inviting all Magisterial District Courts and Courts of Common 
Pleas to participate in collections using this contract. Participation is optional 
and all courts may continue to use a county-based collection agency contract if 
they choose. 

If interested, Magisterial District Courts must secure their president judge’s 
approval.

AOPC/IT plans to implement the new contract over the next several months by 
coordinating a “go-live” date with interested courts. 

The Common Pleas Case Management System and Magisterial District Judge 
System help desks are available to answer questions and discuss how to start 
using the statewide contract. 

Rule change: Citing unpublished 
Superior Court opinions

A new rule recently adopted by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania allows 
unpublished Superior Court opinions to be cited for their persuasive value.

The rule change comes as the result of a recommendation from the Appellate 
Court Procedural Rules Committee and became effective in May.  

It allows parties to rely on unpublished Superior Court memorandum opinions 
filed after May 1, 2019, and unreported Commonwealth Court opinions filed 
after Jan. 15, 2008. 

While the citation of unpublished opinions has traditionally been prohibited, the 
increasing digitalization and online accessibility of these memorandums has 
shifted many courts’ view on the long-standing rule. 

This rule change follows many other courts’ decisions – including both 
Commonwealth Court as well as the federal courts, who both made the rule 
change over a decade ago. 

“This rule change promotes greater transparency for the decisions of the 
intermediate appellate courts,” said Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice 
Christine Donohue. “Most important, however, is that the rule fosters consistent 
treatment of litigants by the various panels of the appellate courts and aids the 
bar in its presentation of cases.”

Wellness 
and the legal 
profession

The Minor Judiciary Education Board introduced a new 
program this year that focuses on improving the overall well-
being of lawyers and judges.  

Davis said the program specifically focuses on lack of work/
life balance, the conflicting external environment of the 
adversarial setting that’s present in the profession and ways 
to incorporate healthy practices.

In the session, Besden also provides resources to assist 
judges in recognising the warning signs of depression, 
suicide, substance abuse and addiction. 

When asked about the response to the program, Davis said 
that judges take the time every week to articulate the great 
value they come away with after attending. 

“The presentation is offered on Fridays and judges often 
remain after class has ended to further the conversation.”

The session, titled “Wellness and the Legal Profession,” is 
presented by Laurie Besden, executive director for Lawyers 
Concerned for Lawyers and Judges Concerned for Judges. 

Judges Concerned for Judges’ services are not only 
available to judges but also to their family members. All 
services are free, confidential, safe and supportive. 

In 2016, the National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being was 
established as a result of two studies that found workers 
in the legal profession have one of the highest rates of 
depression and suicide, at nearly 28 percent. 

The overall goal of the task force is to create a movement 
towards improving the health and well-being of the 
legal profession. One of their recommendations was the 
institution of programs which encourage an open dialogue 
about the facilitation and de-stigmatization of help-seeking 
behaviors. 

“There is an intrinsic stress factor levied upon Magisterial 
District Judges that they encounter both in the courtroom 
and within their communities,” said Susan Davis, executive 
director of the Minor Judiciary Education Board. “We 
wanted to develop curriculum that provided constructive 
approaches for dealing with the unique circumstances 
prevalent in the court system.”

5 ways to improve well-being 
and boost resilience:
1. Practice gratitude

2. Practice mindfulness/meditation 

3. Volunteer to help others  

4. Practice self-compassion 

5. Humor

Faxing takes back seat to scanning 

Technology continues to evolve and change the way courts 
do business. Magisterial District Courts have experienced 
some of those changes as many organizations no longer 
use fax machines. Sharing documents with reporters and 
other agencies via fax has become difficult in this electronic 
age as scanning and email are the preferred methods.

While all AOPC printers have the capability to scan, not all 
counties have chosen to take advantage of this feature 
which allows the Magisterial District Courts to scan and 
attach Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) 
documents to docket entries in the Magisterial District 
Judge System (MDJS). 

Scanning is possible for most Magisterial District Courts 
using the AOPC multifunctional printers in the Magisterial 
District Court offices. Once scanned and saved, the 
document can be attached to an email. Like faxing, courts 
need to be careful not to share confidential information 
when scanning and emailing documents.

If a county would like to start scanning, the district court 
administrator should contact AOPC on behalf of all of the 
Magisterial District Courts within the county. For more 
information about scanning documents and using ERMS in 
the MDJS, please contact Lisa.Polonia@pacourts.us.

Language access– 
beyond the gavel

By Mary Vilter, Esq.

As part of their continued efforts to ensure access to justice for 
all court users with limited English proficiencies (LEP), the AOPC 
and the judicial districts continue to work together to implement 
the statewide Unified Judicial System (UJS) Language Access 
Plan. 

The next phase of the plan addresses the provision of 
meaningful language access for all programs, services and 
activities outside the courtroom.

This includes any service ordered, managed or administered 
by the court – custody mediation, anger management classes, 
domestic violence programs, drug and alcohol evaluations, safe 
driving classes, etc. 

For services administered by the court, language access can be 
provided using a variety of methods, including:
• 
• 
• 

an in-person interpreter from the AOPC roster
qualified bilingual staff 
contracted in-person, telephone and video remote 
interpreters
translated written materials

• 
•  webinars or other activities conducted in languages other 

than English 

When it comes to court-ordered services, judges should use 
their discretion and avoid ordering LEP parties to participate in 
programs that do not provide interpretation or translation. 

For services contracted on behalf of the court, it is important to 
note that if the vendor receives federal funds, they are already 
obligated to provide language access to their LEP participants 
free of charge under Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act. 

As such, judicial districts are encouraged to work with their 
counties to review contract terms, making sure to include 
provisions requiring their vendors comply with Title VI and 
provide meaningful language access. 

Although this is a wide and far-reaching task, many counties 
have already begun taking the steps needed to accomplish it. 

How are counties meeting  
this challenge?

“For our mandatory co-parenting class, we’ve 
contracted with a vendor who provides the class 
in Spanish and in English…For LOTS (languages 
other than Spanish), we provide an interpreter 
for the class or program.” 

Kerry Turtzo  

Lehigh County district court administrator

“We provide interpreters for pre-sentencing, 
Court Reporting Network evaluations (a state 
mandated assessment tool for DUI offenses) 
and Our Children First class.” 

Carol Dillon 

Montgomery County language access coordinator 

“If we become aware that a person needs an 
interpreter, we provide an interpreter – this 
is done on a regular basis for the Drug and 
Alcohol Treatment Services. We also regularly 
send interpreters along to the Alcohol Highway 
Safety program, the domestic violence program, 
and the adult probation department to assist 
with pre-sentence investigations.” 

Frank Castellano 

Lackawanna County district court administrator 

“The two agencies that they [the DA’s Office] 
use for evaluation and treatment, refer the LEP 
clients to classes in their language.” 

Carmen Thome  

Bucks County deputy court administrator 

“We provide sign language interpreters for our 
anger management class…Some of our judges 
will put it on the record when someone needs 
to attend a program outside the courtroom and 
needs to have an interpreter.” 

Monique Gomez 

Northampton County official court interpreter  

(Mary Vilter, Esq. is the 
coordinator for court access.)

Legislative roundup by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

The legislature continued consideration of several constitutional amendments, with a focus on 

appellate jurist selection and victim protection.  Constitutional amendments do not require the 

governor’s signature.  Instead, they must pass in successive legislative sessions, meet specific 

advertising criteria and – finally – be approved by the voters.    

Appellate jurists selection (first passage): 
District elections:  
House Bill 196 provides for the election by district of the 
Supreme, Superior and Commonwealth courts. The districts 
are established by law and must provide every resident of 
the Commonwealth with approximately equal representation 
on a court, be compact and contiguous and contain nearly 
equal population as practicable. The General Assembly 
would provide for the transition to district elections, the 
impact of the change upon eligibility to seek retention and 
the order in which the transition will occur. 

Merit selection:  
House Bill 111 establishes merit selection for vacancies on 
the three appellate courts. The amendment provides for an 
eastern, middle and western region established by law. Two 
justices of the Supreme Court are chosen from each region 
while one is chosen statewide. Five judges of the Superior 
Court are chosen from each region and three judges of the 
Commonwealth Court are chosen from each region.

Current appellate jurists would complete their current 
term and be eligible to seek retention as provided by law 
at the time of their election prior to the adoption of the 
amendment. 

Nominees would be provided by a 13-member Appellate 
Court Nominating Commission. The commission would 
consist of five appointees of the governor and eight of the 
General Assembly. Nominees must be confirmed by two-

thirds of the Senate and upon confirmation, serve four-year 
terms followed by nonpartisan retention elections. 

Victim protection (second passage):
Victim rights amendments: House Bill 276 and Senate 
Bill 149 – known as Marsy’s Law – create a new crime 
victims section within the constitution. Its stated purpose is 
to provide victim justice and due process throughout the 
criminal and juvenile justice systems and the rights provided 
must be protected in a manner no less vigorous than the 
rights afforded to the accused. Victim rights include safety, 
notification, opportunities to be heard, ability to refuse 
interviews or depositions and full and timely restitution. 

Coming Up: 
We anticipate that the leglislature will: 

1. Pass the 2019-20 General Appropriations Act and 

supplemental bills, such as the Fiscal and Administrative 
Codes, both of which could have judicial implications;

2. Explore advancing a second Justice Reinvestment 

Initiative; and 

3. Debate reforms to statutory probation 

provisions.
