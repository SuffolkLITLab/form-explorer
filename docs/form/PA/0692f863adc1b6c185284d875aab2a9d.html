 No. 978 MDA 2022 

Appeal  FROM the Judgment of Sentence Entered May 27, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-36-CR-0005175-2020 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., OLSON, J., and DUBOW, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY OLSON, J.: 

FILED:  MARCH 17, 2023 

Appellant,  Juan  Ortiz-Reyes,  appeals  from  the  judgment  of  sentence 

entered  on  May  27,  2022,  as  made  final  by  the  denial  of  Appellant’s 

post-sentence  motion  on  June  9,  2022.    On  this  direct  appeal,  Appellant’s 

counsel  has  filed  both  a  petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  as  counsel  and  an 

accompanying brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) 

and Commonwealth v. Santiago, 978 A.2d 349 (Pa. 2009).  We conclude 

that  Appellant’s  counsel  has  complied  with  the  procedural  requirements 

necessary to withdraw.  Moreover, after independently reviewing the record, 

we conclude that the instant appeal is wholly frivolous.  We, therefore, grant 

counsel’s  petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  and  affirm  Appellant’s  judgment  of

NON-PRECEDENTIAL DECISION - SEE SUPERIOR COURT I.O.P. 65.37 
 

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 

  IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF 
           PENNSYLVANIA 

sentence. 

  

J-S02021-23 

On April 5, 2022, Appellant entered an open guilty plea to two counts of 

failure to register with the Pennsylvania State Police.1  On May 27, 2022, the 

trial court sentenced Appellant to serve four to ten years in prison on the first 

count  and  to  serve  a  concurrent  term  of  four  to  ten  years  in  prison  on  the 

second count.  Both sentences fall within the standard range of the sentencing 

guidelines.  See N.T. Sentencing Hearing, 5/27/22, at 4; Appellant’s Brief at 

8-9.   

On June 6, 2022, Appellant filed a timely post-sentence motion, where 

he claimed that his sentence was excessive because the trial court “failed to 

properly  consider  [Appellant’s]  medical  history[,  including  Appellant’s 

pericarditis,  cardiomyopathy,  and  atrial  fibrillation,]  .  .  .  and  the  nexus 

between  [Appellant’s  medical  conditions]  and  his  community-based  needs.”  

Appellant’s  Post-Sentence  Motion,  6/6/22,  at  3.    The  trial  court  denied 

Appellant’s post-sentence motion on June 9, 2022 and Appellant filed a timely 

notice of appeal.  On appeal, Appellant’s counsel filed a petition for leave to 

withdraw and counsel accompanied this petition with an Anders brief. 

Before  reviewing  the  merits  of  this  appeal,  this  Court  must  first 

determine  whether  counsel  has 

fulfilled 

the  necessary  procedural 

requirements  for  withdrawing  as  counsel.    Commonwealth  v.  Miller,  715 

A.2d 1203, 1207 (Pa. Super. 1998). 

____________________________________________ 

1 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4915.2(a)(1). 
 

- 2 - 

To  withdraw  under  Anders,  counsel  must  satisfy  certain  technical 

requirements.  First, counsel must “petition the court for leave to withdraw 

stating that, after making a conscientious examination of the record, counsel 

has determined that the appeal would be frivolous.”  Miller, 715 A.2d at 1207.  

Second, counsel must file an Anders brief, in which counsel: 

1) provide[s] a summary of the procedural history and facts, 
with  citations  to  the  record;  (2)  refer[s]  to  anything  in  the 
record  that  counsel  believes  arguably  supports  the  appeal; 
(3)  set[s]  forth  counsel’s  conclusion  that  the  appeal  is 
frivolous;  and  (4)  state[s]  counsel’s  reasons  for  concluding 
that  the  appeal  is  frivolous.    Counsel  should  articulate  the 
relevant facts of record, controlling case law, and/or statutes 
on  point  that  have  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  appeal  is 
frivolous. 

  (

Santiago, 978 A.2d at 361. 

Finally, counsel must furnish a copy of the  Anders brief to his or her 

client  and  advise  the  client  “of  [the  client’s]  right  to  retain  new  counsel, 

proceed pro se or raise any additional points worthy of this Court’s attention.”  

Commonwealth v. Woods, 939 A.2d 896, 898 (Pa. Super. 2007).   

If  counsel  meets  all  of  the  above  obligations,  “it  then  becomes  the 

responsibility  of  the  reviewing  court  to  make  a  full  examination  of  the 

proceedings and make an independent judgment to decide whether the appeal 

is  in  fact  wholly  frivolous.”    Santiago,  978  A.2d  at  355  n.5;  see  also 

Commonwealth  v.  Yorgey,  188  A.3d  1190,  1197  (Pa.  Super.  2018)  (en 

banc) (holding that the Anders procedure requires this Court to review “the 

entire  record  with  consideration  first  of  the  issues  raised  by  counsel.    .  .  .  

J-S02021-23

J-S02021-23 

[T]his  review  does  not  require  this  Court  to  act  as  counsel  or  otherwise 

advocate on behalf of a party.  Rather, it requires us only to conduct a review 

of the record to ascertain if[,] on its face, there are non-frivolous issues that 

counsel, intentionally or not, missed or misstated.  We need not analyze those 

issues of arguable merit; just identify them, deny the motion to withdraw, and 

order  counsel  to  analyze  them”).    It  is  only  when  all  of  the  procedural  and 

substantive  requirements  are  satisfied  that  counsel  will  be  permitted  to 

withdraw. 

In  the  case  at  bar,  counsel  complied  with  all  of  the  above  procedural 

obligations.  We must, therefore, review the entire record and analyze whether 

this appeal is, in fact, wholly frivolous.  Our analysis begins with the claims 

raised  in  the  Anders  brief:    1)  whether  Appellant’s  sentence  is  manifestly 

excessive  and  2)  whether  Appellant  knowingly,  intelligently,  and  voluntarily 

entered his guilty plea.  See Appellant’s Brief at 8-11. 

Appellant's first claim on appeal challenges the discretionary aspects of 

his sentence.  “[S]entencing is a matter vested in the sound discretion of the 

sentencing judge, whose judgment will not be disturbed absent an abuse of 

discretion.”  Commonwealth v. Ritchey, 779 A.2d 1183, 1185 (Pa. Super. 

2001).  

Pursuant  to  statute,  Appellant  does  not  have  an  automatic  right  to 

appeal the discretionary aspects of his sentence.  See 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(b).  

Instead,  Appellant  must  petition  this  Court  for  permission  to  appeal  the 

discretionary aspects of his sentence.  Id. 

- 4 - 

t]o reach the merits of a discretionary sentencing issue, we 
conduct  a  four-part  analysis  to  determine:  (1)  whether 
appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, Pa.R.A.P. 902, 
903;  (2)  whether  the  issue  was  properly  preserved  at 
sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify sentence, 
Pa.R.Crim.P.  720;  (3)  whether  appellant's  brief  has  a  fatal 
defect,  Pa.R.A.P.  2119(f);  and  (4)  whether  there  is  a 
substantial question that the sentence appealed from is not 
appropriate  under  the  Sentencing  Code,  [42  Pa.C.S.A.] 
§ 9781(b). 

As this Court explained: 

  [

Commonwealth v. Cook, 941 A.2d 7, 11 (Pa. Super. 2007). 

Here, Appellant filed a timely post-sentence motion and notice of appeal. 

Further,  Appellant's  post-sentence  motion  claimed  that  his  sentence  is 

excessive  because  the  trial  court  failed  to  consider  his  various  physical 

ailments.    See  Appellant’s  Post-Sentence  Motion,  6/6/22,  at  3.    While 

Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and preserved his sentencing claim in 

a timely post-sentence motion, he failed to include a Rule 2119(f) statement 

in his appellate brief.  Nonetheless, because the Commonwealth did not file a 

brief  and,  therefore,  did  not  object  to  Appellant’s  failure  to  include  a  Rule 

2119(f) statement, we will not find Appellant’s discretionary sentencing claim 

waived.  Commonwealth v. White, 193 A.3d 977, 982 (Pa. Super. 2018).  

Thus, Appellant preserved his current appellate claim.  We will now determine 

whether Appellant's claim presents a “substantial question that the sentence 

appealed  from  is  not  appropriate  under  the  Sentencing  Code.”    Cook,  941 

A.2d at 11. 

J-S02021-23

J-S02021-23 

Generally, to raise a substantial question, an appellant must “advance 

a colorable argument that the trial judge's actions were: (1) inconsistent with 

a specific provision of the Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary to the fundamental 

norms which underlie the sentencing process.”  Commonwealth v. McKiel, 

629 A.2d 1012, 1013 (Pa. Super. 1993); Commonwealth v. Goggins, 748 

A.2d 721, 726 (Pa. Super. 2000) (en banc), appeal denied, 759 A.2d 920 (Pa. 

2000).    Additionally,  in  determining  whether  an  appellant  has  raised  a 

substantial  question,  we  must  limit  our  review  to  Appellant’s  Rule  2119(f) 

statement.    Goggins,  748  A.2d  at  726.    This  limitation  ensures  that  our 

inquiry remains “focus[ed] on the reasons for which the appeal is sought, in 

contrast to the facts underlying the appeal, which are necessary only to decide 

the appeal on the merits.”  Id. at 727 (emphasis omitted). 

Appellant contends that his sentence is excessive because the trial court 

failed to consider his poor physical health and various medical conditions.  See 

Appellant’s  Brief  at  8-10.    This  Court  has  held  that  “an  excessive  sentence 

claim  –  in  conjunction  with  an  assertion  that  the  court  failed  to  consider 

mitigating  factors  –  raises  a  substantial  question.”    Commonwealth  v. 

Swope,  123  A.3d  333,  339  (Pa.  Super.  2015)  (citations  omitted),  citing 

Commonwealth v. Raven, 97 A.3d 1244, 1253 (Pa. Super. 2014); see also 

Commonwealth  v.  Caldwell,  117  A.3d  763,  770  (Pa.  Super.  2015)  (en 

banc) (same).  Nevertheless, Appellant's claim is frivolous because, during the 

sentencing hearing, the trial court demonstrated it was well aware of  – and 

thoroughly considered – Appellant's poor physical health and various medical 

- 6 - 

J-S02021-23 

conditions.    See  N.T.  Sentencing  Hearing,  5/27/22,  at  2  (trial  court 

acknowledged  that  it  read  and  considered  the  pre-sentence  investigation 

report,  which  summarized  Appellant’s  various  medical  conditions)  and  6 

(Appellant’s  attorney  summarized  Appellant’s  various  medical  conditions); 

see also Commonwealth v. Devers, 546 A.2d 12, 18 (Pa. 1988) (“[i]t would 

be foolish, indeed, to take the position that if a court is in possession of the 

facts, it will fail to apply them to the case at hand”). 

Next,  Appellant  claims  that  he  did  not  knowingly,  intelligently,  or 

voluntarily  enter  his  guilty  plea.    This  claim  is  waived,  as  Appellant  did  not 

raise it before the trial court.  See Commonwealth v. Lincoln, 72 A.3d 606, 

609-610  (Pa.  Super.  2013)  (“[a]  defendant  wishing  to  challenge  the 

voluntariness of a guilty plea on direct appeal must either object during the 

plea  colloquy  or  file  a  motion  to  withdraw  the  plea  within  ten  days  of 

sentencing.    Failure  to  employ  either  measure  results  in  waiver”)  (citations 

omitted).  Further, since the claim on appeal is waived, the claim is frivolous 

under  Anders.    Commonwealth  v.  Tukhi,  149  A.3d  881,  888-889  (Pa. 

Super.  2016)  (holding  that,  under  Anders,  “[a]n  issue  that  is  waived  is 

frivolous”);  Commonwealth  v.  Kalichak,  943  A.3d  285,  291  (Pa.  Super. 

2008) (holding: “this issue has been waived. Having been waived, pursuing 

this matter on direct appeal is frivolous”). 

We have independently considered the issues raised within Appellant’s 

brief and we have determined that the claims are frivolous.  In addition, after 

an  independent  review  of  the  entire  record,  we  see  nothing  that  might 

- 7 - 

J-S02021-23 

arguably  support  this  appeal.    The  appeal  is  therefore  wholly  frivolous.  

Accordingly, we affirm Appellant’s judgment of sentence and grant counsel’s 

petition for leave to withdraw. 

Petition  for  leave  to  withdraw  appearance  granted.    Judgment  of 

sentence affirmed.  Jurisdiction relinquished.
