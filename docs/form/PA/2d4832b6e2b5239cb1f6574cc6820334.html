Honoring veterans in the 
Pennsylvania judiciary

SPECIAL EDITION(l to r):  Problem-Solving Courts 
Administrator Angela Sobol Lowry, Judicial 
Programs Administrator Andy Simpson, 
Supreme Court Justice Debra Todd, York 
County Common Pleas Judge Craig 
Trebilcock, Lycoming County President 
Judge Nancy Butts, Philadelphia Municipal 
Court President Judge Patrick Dugan, 
Widener Law School Dean Christian 
Johnson

that VTC participants struggle with – 
especially issues with transportation.

“Being in a very rural county, 
transportation becomes one of the 
biggest struggles for our participants – 
many of them either don’t have access 
to public transportation or have driver’s 
license suspensions stemming from 
previous DUIs. We really try to pair 
mentors who have licenses with those 
participants who don’t so they can 
drive them to and from court,” Judge 
Butts said. 

Judge Trebilcock went on to address 
the third problem, saying that York 
County has even begun providing 
financial counselors and setting 
up cooking classes for those VTC 
participants struggling with financial 
problems.  

“We found that some of these guys, 
because they never learned to cook, 
were blowing all their money on fast 
food, so the goal is to try to show them 
how to make their money go further,” 
he said. 

For people who say these aren’t cost-
effective solutions, I would argue that 
they are because the alternative is jail, 
which costs roughly $100 taxpayer 
dollars per day per inmate.”

Karen Baer, a VJO specialist from 
the Wilkes-Barre VA, explained that 
if a county doesn’t have adequate 
funding or staffing to have a full-blown 
VTC, creating a veterans track within 
their existing treatment courts could 
potentially be another option. 

“These veterans track programs have 
to follow the same standards and 
protocols as other Veterans Courts 
and counties are now able to utilize VA 
resources and funding,” she explained.

Making 
the case for 
Veterans 
Treatment  
Courts

Widener University Commonwealth 
Law School held the 3rd Annual 
Veterans Court Symposium, “Making 
the Case for Veterans Treatment 
Courts” in September.

During the morning sessions, panels 
of judges, county commissioners 
and veteran justice outreach (VJO) 
specialists from the federal Veterans 
Affairs (VA) spoke about their personal 
experience with the significant positive 
impacts of veterans courts on the lives 
of individual veterans and communities 
as a whole. 

In her opening keynote remarks, 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice 
Debra Todd explained that Veterans 
Treatment Court (VTC) participants 
often look to the judge as their 
commanding officer, leading to a 
sentiment later repeated throughout 

the program – “Judges are the 
glue that hold our Veterans Courts 
together.”

York County Common Pleas Judge 
Craig Trebilcock, an army veteran, 
moderated the judges’ panel, where 
he offered some words of advice to 
judges interested in setting up a VTC 
in their county. 

He said there are three main problems 
that cause participants to fail the 
program – housing, financial and 
transportation. He explained some of 
the ways that his county has helped 
their VTC participants try to overcome 
these barriers.

“We stole the idea from Lancaster to 
set up a veteran housing unit and it 
actually helps address two of those 
problems,” said Judge Trebilcock. 
“Providing participants with stable 
housing makes transportation easier 
because participants can now carpool 
to court appointments.”

York County has also tried to help 
address the transportation problem 
by loaning bikes from the sheriff’s 
department that participants can ride 
to the bus stop – and partnering with 
Rabbit Transit, who are sometimes on-
call to pick up participants and take 
them to court appointments. 

President Judge Nancy Butts also 
discussed the ways Lycoming County 
has tried to address some challenges 

1

Dauphin County Commissioner, Jeff 
Haste, emphasized that point saying 
they initially anticipated there would 
be funding issues, but their county has 
actually seen a cost-savings due to the 
funding through the VA.

“All of these Veterans Court programs 
will resemble the judge who presides 
over them. When it comes to trying to 
solve these problems, it’s really up to 

the judge’s creativity – no program is 
identical by any means,” Judge Butts 
said.

When discussing how VTC program 
specifics can widely differ based on 
the county and judge, Philadelphia 
Municipal Court President Judge 
Patrick Dugan, a U.S. Army veteran, 
explained that the judge presiding over 
a VTC doesn’t necessarily have to be a 

veteran themselves; they just need to 
be someone with empathy. 

Dugan encouraged judges who 
don’t have that service experience 
to surround themselves with people 
who do because in order to make 
VTC a success, you have to tap into 
the participants’ military culture and 
service. 

Veterans Treatment Court awareness 
and mentor recruitment

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania Justice Debra Todd 
delivered a powerful message in two new videos 
highlighting Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) as well as 
stressing the importance and critical need for volunteer 
veteran mentors. 

The videos provide the opportunity to hear directly from 
participants and graduates how VTC has given them their 
life back. One of the common themes participants cite along 
their journey is the critical role a veteran mentor plays in 
their success.

The videos were produced by AOPC/Communications 
with the cooperation of several county courts, participants, 
graduates, mentors, probation, judicial staff and treatment 
court coordinators.

Mentors are veterans who share common experiences 
with the Veterans Court participants, and who volunteer 
their time to support VTC participants navigating the court, 
treatment and Veterans Affairs systems.  

“The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is committed to doing 
everything we can to support the men and women who 
have served our country as they transition back to civilian 
life,” said Justice Todd. 

This rehabilitative court helps veterans by combining 
treatment and personal accountability, with the goal of 
breaking the cycle of addiction and criminal behavior.  

According to Justice Todd, “Veterans deeply value their 
military experience and share a bond with their fellow vets.  
The mentor component builds upon this camaraderie; it is 
unique, and it is one of the key ingredients to the success of 
our Veterans Courts.”

mentor at veterans.pacourts.us.

“Veterans Courts truly help our veterans find their way back 
home,” added Justice Todd.

Veterans 
Treatment 
Court 
participant 
pays it forward 
as a mentor 

When Ally Murr was honorably discharged from the U.S. 
Army in 2010, she found herself unable to cope with her 
severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), turning to 
drugs and alcohol to try to numb the pain.   

Racking up a lengthy list of charges, she found herself in 
and out of jail. After receiving her worst charges, she landed 
before Huntingdon County President Judge George Zanic. 

“That’s when Judge Zanic heard that I was a veteran - no 
one had ever bothered to ask that before. He had sympathy 
for me.” 

“As a veteran, it’s hard to 
explain the bond, no matter 
what branch you were in, there 
is this deep bond you have with 
each other. I don’t know how to 
put it into words.”

Ally was transferred from Huntingdon to Dauphin County 
where she was enrolled in their Veterans Treatment Court 
(VTC) program. 

Last month, Judge William Tully and her former probation 
officer, Brian Wagner, watched with pride as Ally recounted 
her journey during an interview in the very same courtroom 
she used to sit in as a participant as compared to now as a 
mentor to other participants.  

“Being a mentor is more rewarding than anything money 
could buy…to see another veteran in a dark place and be 
able to help them grow mentally, emotionally and spiritually 
is incredible,” she said. 

Ally Murr, program paritcipant and Veteran Treatment Court mentor

I have a mentee and she is actually a mom too, and I’ve 
been able to use what I’ve been through to give her hope 
and strength.”

When talking about the profound, life-changing impact that 
her probation officer and Judge Tully had on her life, she 
was asked why that program worked when nothing else did. 

“That was also the first time in my life an authority figure 
looked at me and had hope, and that means the world to 
people like me who were struggling so much,” Ally said. 

When asked what advice she would give to other veterans 
struggling with addiction, she said, “In training, we are 
taught we have to control the situation… and you can apply 
that to your recovery by taking control of your own life, no 
matter how bad the situation you’ve gotten yourself in.”

Not only has Ally turned her life around, but she’s now made 
it her life purpose to help other veterans and addicts who 
are struggling like she was.

Celebrating three years in recovery, Ally also works for 
a nonprofit, Just For Today (JFT) as a veteran services 
coordinator and is currently working towards getting her 
bachelor’s degree in social work - which she hopes to use to 
become a therapist for other veterans struggling with PTSD 
and addiction.

Pennsylvania Veterans 
Treatment Courts

Veterans Treatment Courts (VTC) are rigorous  

“As Americans, we owe 

12-24 month programs that assist justice-involved 

a debt of gratitude to 

veterans struggling with addiction, mental health 

issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder or  

co-occurring disorders as a result of their service  

to this country. 

VTC participants – 

•  Appear before their judge on a regular basis

•  Receive support and guidance from veteran mentors

•	 Are	intensely	supervised	by	specialized	probation	officers

•  Receive treatment from Veterans Affairs or local treatment providers

Veteran mentors are volunteer veterans who act as role models for the 

veterans in the program by coaching and guiding them throughout the 

process. The shared experiences of another veteran is critical in helping 

the participant connect to and maintain treatment, regain control of his/

her life and successfully complete the program. 

our military veterans. 

Veterans Courts help 

veterans by combining 

treatment and personal 

accountability, with the 

goal of breaking the 

cycle of addiction and 

criminal behavior.”

Court Justice Debra Todd

“The Army has enriched my life. The first big thing the Army 
teaches you is about doing things for more than just yourself. 
You think of others. There’s no place for ego. Leadership comes 
from that. You have the back of your fellow soldiers and they 
have yours. As a judge, you continue to work as a team with 
the staff, the parties, attorneys and witnesses to achieve 
justice. It is a wonderful thing if it works right and just like the 
Army, justice is not about me being the judge, it is about being 
a member of a team. A judge is like a high-ranking officer and 
that judge has to guide people through a challenge. It is about 
ensuring a fair process and a fair result.”

“Serving my country as a United States Marine Corps Officer 
was a dream come true. As a child, I met an uncle of mine who 
was a Marine and his walk, talk and bearing was different; 
he moved with confidence and took life in stride. The training I 
received as a Marine helped me to realize that the human body 
is made to do so much more than we think and that groups 
of hard-charging Americans infused with esprit de corps, 
and God’s blessing, can conquer any enemy. Civilian world 
translation: there is no problem too big to handle.”

Judge Daniel Bowman
Adams County

•  Joined the Army at 17 years old in 1969
•  Served in Vietnam as a Sgt. E-5 with 9th Inf.,  

25th Inf. and E Troop 17 Cav. 173 Airborne Brigade
•  He was motivated to serve by the service of his 

father, seven uncles and two aunts who served in 
World War II

•  He believes that his Catholic education and the 

words of President John F. Kennedy inspired him to 
serve: “And so, my fellow Americans-ask not what 
your country can do for you-ask what you can do for 
your country. My fellow citizens of the world-ask not 
what America will do for you but what together we 
can do for the freedom of man.”

“I have learned to never discount anyone. Everyone has 
strong and weak points. Work with whomever you have to 
deal with, form a relationship in a joint effort towards the 
goal you seek. Be fair, be civil but don’t be afraid to use any 
tools that you need to make good and fair decisions.”

We also wish to say a special thank you 
to employees within the court system 
who have served or continue to serve, 
in the United States military:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
