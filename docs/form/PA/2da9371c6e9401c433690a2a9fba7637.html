Purpose of this Manual 

 
The following manual is designed to help you understand the workings 

 
of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and to address some of the most 
common errors that cause delays in getting your pleadings before the Court.  
This manual is intended to provide procedural guidance only, and does not 
provide substantive legal advice. 

As you will see noted throughout this manual, this manual is not a 

complete explanation of all pleadings that can be filed with the Office of the 
Prothonotary, but rather is an attempt to survey the most common filings and 
most common mistakes made by Pro Se litigants.  You, and you alone, are fully 
responsible for understanding the Judicial Code, the Rules of Appellate 
Procedure, and the caselaw as they apply to your individual case. 
 

How to Use this Manual 
 
This manual is divided into five sections.   

Section One is titled “Filing Pro Se.”  Section One attempts to explain the 

rights that you have as a Pro Se litigant and some of the restrictions or 
limitations that you may find, when you proceed Pro Se. 

Section Two is titled “The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.”  Section Two 

surveys the history of the Court and precisely what powers and 
responsibilities the Court has within the three branches of Pennsylvania’s 
Government. 

Section Three is titled “The Office of the Prothonotary.”  You will not be 
dealing directly with the Justices of the Court.  All filings and communications 
that you wish to make to the Court must be filed with the Office of the 
Prothonotary.  Section Three attempts to explain the purpose of the Office of 
the Prothonotary and the powers and limitations of the Office as established 
by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and General Assembly. 

Section Four is titled “Most-Common Filings.”  In Section Four, this 

manual surveys the most-common filings made to the Office of the 
Prothonotary. 

    

  

    

 

  

  

  

  

3 
 

Section Five is titled “Formatting, Number of Copies, Fees and Deadlines 

for Filing.”  Section Five is especially important, as that section attempts to 
provide guidance on the most-common errors that Pro Se litigants make in 
filing with the Office of the Prothonotary.  While you should read each section 
of this manual before filing with the Court, you should pay particular attention 
to all the issues addressed in Section Five as those are the areas where 
problems may unnecessarily delay your case. 
 

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania embraces the idea that access to the 

Courts is a fundamental right of all Pennsylvanians.  We hope you find this 
manual informative and easy to use.  If you have any questions or issues, 
please do not hesitate to contact us.

Through its long history, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (or the 

Supreme Court) has been, and continues to 
be, committed to dispensing justice for all 
Pennsylvanians.  Some litigants, for any 
number of reasons, may find it necessary to 
represent themselves pro se before the 
Court. 
 

Pro Se, n.  One who represents 
oneself in a court proceeding 
without the assistance of a 
lawyer - Black’s Law Dictionary, 
10th Edition 

The purpose of this manual is to aid you, proceeding pro se, in preparing 

pleadings to file with the Supreme Court.  The information in this manual 
attempts to explain the procedural steps for filing in the Supreme Court , in 
compliance with the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure (or the Rules 
or Pa.R.A.P.).  This manual does not replace the Rules and, as the Rules of 

Appellate Procedure are subject to change, it is your 
responsibility to review the Rules for any changes.

cannot guarantee the accuracy of all the rules listed.  The most-current rules are 
published by West twice a year in a book titled “Pennsylvania Rules of Court,” 
and can be found in law libraries and many local libraries as well.

Restrictions and Limitations to 
Proceeding Pro Se 

ike most rights, access to the Courts is not without boundaries.  For the 

purposes of this manual, the boundaries of filing in the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania are defined by the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, 
the Judicial Code, and evolving caselaw. 
 

One such rule limits the filing rights of those who are currently 

represented by court-appointed counsel or private counsel. 

Pa.R.A.P.  3304  -  Hybrid  Representation  -  Where  a  litigant  is 
represented  by  an  attorney  before  the  Court  and  the  litigant 
submits  for  filing  a  petition,  motion,  brief  or  any  other  type  of 
pleading  in  the  matter,  it  shall  not  be  docketed  but  forwarded to 
counsel of record. 
 

If a filing deadline is approaching and you believe you have been 

abandoned by counsel or you have no further legal avenues, you may be 
allowed to file your pleading Pro Se.  While the record and procedural history 
is different in every case, the Office of the Prothonotary and the Court reserve 
the right to administratively dispose of your pleading in compliance with 
Pa.R.A.P. 3304 without reviewing the merits of your argument. 
 

If you have court-appointed counsel and you desire to proceed pro se, it 

is often best to file a petition to proceed Pro Se in the court that appointed 
counsel for you, in compliance with that court’s specific rules. 
 

Another restriction is that non-attorneys are generally not allowed to 

file an appeal on behalf of another person or business, even if you have a 
“power of attorney,” as this is considered the practice of law without a license. 
 

The Court is charged with reviewing issues of law that affect all 

Pennsylvanians and the Court’s decision becomes the law of the 
Commonwealth.  Often times arguments are best framed and explored by an 
attorney admitted to the Pennsylvania bar and familiar with the area of 

6 
 

  L

       

                     

7 
 

Pennsylvania law from which your case arises.  It is highly suggested that you 
have an attorney prepare your filing.   
 

Pro Se litigants are held to the same procedural standard as attorneys 

admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Filing Pro Se does 
not exempt you from understanding and following the Pennsylvania Rules of 
Appellate Procedure.  If your filing complies with the Rules and any applicable 
statutes, the Court will review the merits of your case and decide if you are 
due relief. 

  Whether  you  have  an  attorney  file  on  your  behalf  or  decide  to 

proceed  Pro  Se,  the  Court  will  review  your  pleading(s)  and 
decide whether your arguments have merit.

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is the longest continually serving 

court in the United States of America.  While the Court has operated since 
1684 it wasn’t officially established by the General Assembly as an 
independent court until 1722.  The Court has been an independent branch of 
Pennsylvania’s government ever since. 
 

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania consists of one Chief Justice and six 
associate Justices.  The longest serving Justice becomes the Chief Justice when 
there is a vacancy.  Each Justice is elected to the Supreme Court by the citizens 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a ten-year term.  Every ten years 
the Justice is held to a retention vote.  In a retention vote a Justice does not 
have an opponent, rather the citizens of the Commonwealth have the choice to 
retain the Justice for another ten-year term or not. 
 

Generally, the Court sits as a full body to decide each matter before it.  

The vast majority of cases before the Court are decided on the papers filed 
with the Court and rarely are cases physically argued before the Court.  The 
instances where cases are argued are dealt with in other sections of this 
manual. 

10 
 

he Constitutional amendments of 1968 established a Unified Judicial 
System, which includes the Supreme Court, Superior Court, Commonwealth 
Court, Common Pleas Courts, Philadelphia Municipal Court, and Magisterial 
District Courts.  The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has the supervisory 
authority and responsibility of maintaining the Unified Judicial System. 
 

As part of that supervisory authority, the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania issues administrative rules, known as the Rules of Court, to 
ensure that litigants that request access to any court in the Unified Judicial 
System receive consistent and fair service throughout the Commonwealth.

There are generally four types of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of 

Pennsylvania: original, appellate, exclusive, and extraordinary.  Specific 
jurisdiction will be discussed later in this manual. 
 

A review of this manual in conjunction with the Judicial Code and Rules 

of Court will help you to decide the appropriate course of action given your 
particular circumstances.

Pennsylvania’s Courts have powers specifically given to them by 

Pennsylvania’s Constitution.  Correspondingly, the Federal Government’s 
Courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have powers specifically 
given to them by the Constitution of the United States of America. 

t times, the Federal Courts will request, through a Certification of 

Question of Law, that Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court provide them with an 
official interpretation of Pennsylvania statutes or caselaw to help them decide 
matters before their Court.  Further, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania often 
interprets and applies Federal statutes 
and caselaw to matters before it.

! 

While the distinction between the state and federal jurisdictions 
may  seem  unclear,  one  thing  is  certain  -  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Pennsylvania  cannot  overrule  an  official  judgment  from  a 
Federal Court in a particular case. 

There may be additional review available to you, however, the 
jurisdiction of the federal courts is not within the purview of this manual - 
further research on your part is necessary. 
 

The Supreme Court rarely gathers evidence or determine facts.  In 

general, when you file an appeal with the Supreme Court, the Court decides 
the case based on evidence that is already part of the record.  

 

! 

Only  in  rare  circumstances,  such as when  exclusive  jurisdiction 
rests with the Supreme Court or when the Supreme Court takes 
extraordinary jurisdiction from another Court, will the Supreme 
Court of Pennsylvania act as a fact finder.

Throughout its history, the Supreme Court has had a need for personnel 

to organize its dockets and oversee the distribution of papers to and from 
various parties.   
 

In the earliest days of Pennsylvania, the position of Prothonotary was a 
coveted position for many of the state’s officials, as the Prothonotary’s salary 
was the Court fees levied on the litigants 
involved.   
 

Today, the Prothonotary is appointed by 

administrative rule of the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania and the salary is not related to the 
fees collected by the Court.  The Prothonotary, personally and through staff, is 
charged with maintaining order in the Court’s filings and records, primarily by 
enforcing the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure and interpreting 
caselaw relating to issues of access to the Courts. 

Prothonotary, n.  A chief 
clerk in certain courts of 
law. - Black’s Law 
Dictionary 10th Edition 
 

 

! 

While the Prothonotaries of the Appellate Courts are appointed, 
most county Prothonotaries and Clerks of Courts are elected 
officials.  As a result, the administrative power of the Unified 
Judicial System, with respect to county officials, may be limited. 
 

 

                   

16 
 

Power and Responsibility of the 
Prothonotary 

 

The responsibilities of the Prothonotary are described in Chapter 31 of 

the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Some highlights include: 
maintaining dockets (Pa.R.A.P. 3113), maintaining original records when the 
matter is before the appellate court (Pa.R.A.P. 3114), and keeping track of 
inactive matters (Pa.R.A.P. 3115).  Most of these matters are not handled by 
the Prothonotary personally, but rather are handled by duly authorized 
personnel in the Office of the Prothonotary (Pa.R.A.P. 3112). 
 

On average, the Court each year reviews nearly 3,000 appeals in one 
form or another, as well as another 3,000 ancillary requests each year.  In 
order for these requests to be processed and reviewed in an orderly and 
prompt manner the Court has given the Prothonotary the power to generate 
decrees in administrative matters, through official orders or correspondence. 

Pa.R.A.P. 3305 - Administrative Motions - The Prothonotary, in the 
first  instance,  is  authorized  to  dispose  of  motions  relating  to  the 
preparation, printing and filing of appendix and briefs and those 
motions  generally  relating  to  calendar  control,  along  with  the 
authority to recommend the appropriate sanction for the violation 
of any applicable rule or order. 

                   

                     

 

       

   

17 
 

Pa.R.A.P.  105  (a)  -  Waiver  and  Modification  of  Rules  -  […]    In  the 
interest of expediting decision, or for other good cause shown, an 
appellate  court  may,  except  as  otherwise  provided[…],  disregard 
the requirements or provisions of any of these rules in a particular 
case[…] 
 

Please  keep  in  mind,  all  cases  are  different;  a  rule  may  be  waived  or 
enforced in a case similar to yours, but that does not mean that the rule will be 
waived or enforced in your case. 

 

! 

No official order is required for the Office of the Prothonotary to 
request that corrections be made to your pleadings or to 
administratively close your case for a fatal non-compliance with 
rules or statutes. 

nother important function of the Prothonotary is to enforce standards 

of communication between parties and to 
act as a conduit between the Court and the 
parties.  By rules governing judicial ethics, 
individual Justices are prevented from 
participating in ex parte communication.

communication between counsel 
and the court when opposing 
counsel is not present.  Such 
communications are ordinarily 
prohibited - Black’s Law 
Dictionary 10th Edition 
 

  

   

  A

Further, in order to expeditiously move a case along, the Prothonotary 

has the discretion to modify or waive the Rules. 

 !  Every pleading you wish the Court to see must be sent to the 

Office of the Prothonotary.  Nothing should be mailed directly 
to the chambers of any Justice. 
 

         

            

                    

18 
 

Limitations to the Prothonotary’s 
Powers 

The Prothonotary will not dismiss your case on the merits of your 
argument.  However, the Prothonotary will conduct a preliminary review of 
your argument to determine if your pleading attempts to circumvent the 
Rules.   
 

For example, if you seek to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Court 
in order to appeal a final order, your pleading may be returned, unfiled, as an 
original jurisdiction pleading may not be used to circumvent the appellate 
process.  If you file a pleading under a different name that attempts to reargue 
claims in your case that have already been reviewed by the Court, you may be 
advised that you are not allowed to proceed (“take another bite at the apple”).  
The examples above are not exclusive but are provided to give you some idea 
of filings that are unacceptable. 
 

The Prothonotary continuously strives to provide the public with 

reasonable access to the Courts.  

 

! 

If your pleading is jurisdictionally sound and complies with the 
applicable  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  and 
statutes,  your  papers  will  be  placed  on  the  appropriate 
permanent  docket  and  presented  to  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Pennsylvania for a review of your arguments. 

Please keep in mind, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania does not have 
the resources to make a specialized legal staff available to the public.  In other 
words, we are unable to provide you with advice on the legal arguments of 
your pleadings.  However, if you have any procedural questions, please 
contact the Office of the Prothonotary.

Be aware, your case has a separate set of facts from every other 
case  before  the  Court  and  while  the  Office  of  the  Prothonotary 
can  offer  general  procedural  information  to  you,  you  are  still 
ultimately responsible for researching your case and deciding if 
the information provided to you was applicable.

Petition for Allowance of Appeal 

The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review appeals taken by 

allowance under 42 Pa.C.S. §724(a) from any final order from the 
Commonwealth Court not appealable as of right, or from any final order of the 
Superior Court.  A final order is generally defined as an order of the 
Commonwealth Court or the Superior Court that concludes an appeal, 
including an order that remands an appeal, in whole or in part, unless the 
Commonwealth Court or the Superior Court retains jurisdiction (Pa.R.A.P. 
1112(b)). 

A Petition for Allowance of Appeal, or an “allocatur,” is a concise 
statement of your case and matters on appeal.  The Petition for Allowance of 
Appeal is to address the reasons that the Supreme Court should permit you to 
appeal. 

 

! 

Per  Pa.R.A.P.  1115(d),  the  failure  of a  petitioner  to  be accurate, 
clear  and  concise  is  sufficient  reason  to  deny  a  Petition  for 
Allowance of Appeal. 
 

Because the Court has discretion to decide which cases it will hear, the 
Court will look for special and important reasons to allow appeal as dictated 
in Pa.R.A.P. 1114 (see below). 

Of  the  3,000 initial  pleadings  filed in  the  Supreme  Court  in  an  average 
year,  over  two-thirds  are  allocaturs.    Roughly  3%  of  those  allocaturs  are 
granted  and  placed  on  the  appeal  docket.    An  allocatur  petition  is  not  an 
appeal; it is a request for your case to be heard on appeal. 
 

 

             

  

                  

  

a.R.A.P. 1114 – Standards Governing Allowance of Appeal 

(a) General Rule. - Except as prescribed in Pa.R.A.P.  1101 (appeals as of 
right from the Commonwealth Court), review of a final order of the 
Superior Court or the Commonwealth Court is not a matter of right, but of 
sound judicial discretion, and an appeal will be allowed only when there 
are special and important reasons therefor. 

(b) Standards. A petition for allowance of appeal may be granted for any 
of the following reasons:  

(1) the holding of the intermediate appellate court conflicts with another 
intermediate appellate court opinion;  

(2) the holding of the intermediate appellate court conflicts with a 
holding of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court or the United States Supreme 
Court on the same legal question;  

(3) the question presented is one of first impression;  

(4) the question presented is one of such substantial public importance as 
to require prompt and definitive resolution by the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court;  

(5) the issue involves the constitutionality of a statute of the 
Commonwealth;  

(6) the intermediate appellate court has so far departed from accepted 
judicial practices or so abused its discretion as to call for the exercise of 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s supervisory authority; or  

(7) the intermediate appellate court has erroneously entered an order 
quashing or dismissing an appeal.

Time for Filing a Petition for 
Allowance of Appeal 

With the exception of an order involving the Pennsylvania Election Code 

or Local Government Unit Debt Act (10 days), you must file your Petition for 
Allowance of Appeal to the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days from the 
entry of a Commonwealth Court or Superior Court final order or order 
denying reargument (Pa.R.A.P. 1113(a)). 

Per Pa.R.A.P. 105(b), you may not file for an extension of time to file a 

Petition for Allowance of Appeal.  Therefore, if your thirty-day deadline is 
approaching it is important that you send us something of substance in the 
nature of a Petition for Allowance of Appeal; this may preserve your filing date 
and, if so, the Prothonotary’s office may give you extra time to perfect your 
pleading. 

 !  The  time  for  filing  a  Petition  for  Allowance  of  Appeal  does  not 

run from the date you receive a final order, but rather from the  
date the intermediate appellate court files the order. 

Other than the two exceptions listed below, your filing date is the date 

your Petition for Allowance of Appeal is received by the Office of the 
Prothonotary.   
 

The first exception, is for incarcerated filers under the “Prisoner 
Mailbox Rule” (see Smith v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 546 
Pa. 115, 125, 683 A.2d 278, 283 (1996), Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. 
Jones, 549 Pa. 58, 64, 700 A.2d 423, 426 (1997)).  Generally, your filing date 
will be preserved by the date marked on the envelope in which your filing is 
sent.  If your filing is late you may be asked to provide a dated Inmate Cash 
Slip to prove you delivered the filing to prison officials on, or before, the date 
your Petition for Allowance of Appeal was due to be filed. 
 

The second exception, is to provide a U.S. Postal Service Form 3817, 
which the Post Office will stamp with the date the pleading is mailed, or other 

24 
 

               

  

                

25 
 

similar U.S. Postal Service form from which the date of deposit can be verified.  
You should write the intermediate appellate court docket number on the 
Postal Form 3817.   

f you are unable to file a timely 
Petition for Allowance of Appeal, your only 
recourse, if you still wish for the Court to 
review the merits of your case, would be to 
file for Nunc Pro Tunc relief.  In a Petition 
for Leave to File a Petition for Allowance of 
Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc you are only allowed 
to make legal arguments about why you were not able to timely file.  If the 
Court grants you Nunc Pro Tunc relief, you would then be able to make 
arguments about the merits of your case in the form of a Petition for 
Allowance of Appeal.

Answering a Petition for Allowance of 
Appeal 

 

Depending on the circumstances of your case, opposing parties will be 

allowed to file an answer to a Petition for Allowance of Appeal within fourteen 
or seventeen days from the date of service.   

They are also allowed to file a letter stating they will not be filing an 

answer.  The failure of an opposing party to file an answer will not be 
interpreted by the Court as agreement with your pleading (Pa.R.A.P. 1116(a)).  
The Office of the Prothonotary will not compel the respondent to file an 
answer addressing the issues raised in your allocatur. 

After all answers are received, or the date for filing an answer has 
passed, your papers will be forwarded to the full Court for review (Pa.R.A.P. 
1121).  After your papers are forwarded to the Court, generally, you will not 
be able to file any further pleadings without leave of court. 

Pa.R.A.P. 2501 – Post-submission Communications

thereof,  except  upon  application  or  when  expressly  allowed  at

Petition for Allowance of Appeal 
Denied: Reconsideration 

 
If the Supreme Court issues an order denying your Petition for 
Allowance of Appeal, the Prothonotary will send you a certified copy of the 
order via first class mail, at your address of record.  After the denial of 
allocatur, the only pleading that you are allowed to file with the Court is an 
Application for Reconsideration.  Please keep in mind that the Court has 
reviewed your papers and arguments, so there is no need to file, and the Court 
will not grant, a redundant argument in the form of an Application for 
Reconsideration.   

Pa.R.A.P. 1123(b) - Denial of Appeal; Reconsideration. 

[Text intentionally omitted] 

(b) Reconsideration. Applications for reconsideration of denial of allowance of 
appeal are not favored and will be considered only in the most extraordinary 
circumstances.  

(1) Briefly and distinctly state grounds which are confined to intervening 
circumstances of substantial or controlling effect.  

No answer to an application for reconsideration will be received unless 
requested by the Supreme Court. Second or subsequent applications for 
reconsideration, and applications for reconsideration which are out of time 
under this rule, will not be received.

The Office of the Prothonotary will request the original record from the 

court that is currently holding it.  After the original record is received, the 
Office of the Prothonotary will issue a briefing schedule, that will establish the 
due dates of the Appellant’s Brief, and notify all parties via first class mail.  At 
this point, probable jurisdiction has already been noted by the allocatur grant, 
so there is no need to file a Notice of Appeal or Jurisdictional Statement.  For 
help in filing briefs, please see the Briefing the Issues section.

Most commonly, the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction of appeals 

from any final order entered in any matter which was originally commenced 
in the Commonwealth Court, and was not an appeal of an order or decision 
from another court, an agency that has an internal appeal unit (42 Pa.C.S. 
§723(a)), or magisterial district judge.  A final order is generally defined as an 
order that disposes of all claims and of all parties (Pa.R.A.P. 341). 

Appeals of Right 

   

 !  Generally, if your appeal originated from a Court of Common 

Pleas order or an agency that has its own appeal board of review, 
the appropriate filing is a Petition for Allowance of Appeal. 
 

If you have determined that your case falls under the statutory 

requirements of an appeal as of right, you must file your Notice of Appeal and 
Jurisdictional Statement with the Commonwealth Court or in the court in 
which the order being appealed was filed.  Failure to file your Notice of Appeal 
in the appropriate Court may result in unnecessary delay. 
 

The  form  of  the  Notice  of  Appeal  is  described  in  Pa.R.A.P.  904(a),  and 

has been altered below for this Court’s specific needs:

In  addition  to  your  Notice  of  Appeal  you  must  file  a  Jurisdictional 
 
Statement (Pa.R.A.P. 909), in which you make a legal argument as to why the 
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has exclusive jurisdiction of the appeal.   

Pa.R.A.P. 910 - Jurisdictional Statement. Content. Form. 

(a) General rule. The jurisdictional statement required by Rule 909 shall 
contain the following in the order set forth:  

(1) A reference to the official and unofficial reports of the opinions 
delivered in the courts below, if any, and if reported, the citation thereto. 
Any unreported opinions shall be appended to the jurisdictional 
statement; 

(2) A statement of the basis, either by Act of Assembly or general rule, for 
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or the cases believed to sustain that 
jurisdiction; 

(3) The text of the order in question, or the portions thereof sought to be 
reviewed, and the date of its entry in the court. The order may be 
appended to the statement; 

(4) A concise statement of the procedural history of the case; and 

(5) The questions presented for review, expressed in the terms and the 
circumstances of the case but without unnecessary detail. The statement 
of questions presented will be deemed to include every subsidiary question 
fairly comprised therein. Only the questions set forth in the statement, or 
fairly comprised therein will ordinarily be considered by the Court. 

(b) Matters of form. The jurisdictional statement need not be set forth in 
numbered paragraphs in the manner of a pleading. It shall be as short as 
possible and shall not exceed 1000 words, excluding the appendix. 

[Remaining text intentionally omitted] 

 

 !  Generally,  any  question  that  is  not  presented  for  review  in  the 

Jurisdictional Statement is considered waived at the briefing stage. 
 

33 
 

                                                                           

34 
 

The Jurisdictional Statement is a brief statement of the issues in 

 
question and the procedural history of the case.  Only if the Court were to note 
probable jurisdiction and issue a briefing schedule would you be able to make 
full and complete legal arguments as to the merits of the questions you 
presented for review in the jurisdictional statement. 

As stated above, after the Court issues an order noting probable 

jurisdiction, the Prothonotary’s office will request the original record from the 
Court that possesses the record.  After the Prothonotary’s office receives and 
dockets the original record, a briefing schedule will be sent to your address of 
record.  The briefing schedule will set the due date for the Appellant’s brief – 
the due dates for all remaining briefs will be determined by the date and 
method of service. 

  

                                                           

35 
 

After a briefing schedule is issued, you will have a chance to fully brief 

the issues that you feel are legally appropriate.  

If you will be filing a Reproduced Record in your case, you must file a 

Designation of Contents of Reproduced Record thirty days before the 
Appellant’s brief is due (Pa.R.A.P. 2154).  Your Reproduced Record should be 
filed in accordance with Pa.R.A.P. 2152 and Pa.R.A.P. 2153. 

If you are proceeding in forma pauperis or are otherwise exempt from 
filing a Reproduced Record you may instead immediately focus on filing your 
brief. 

 !  If the Court has reviewed the issues set forth in previous filings 

and limited the issues you should address in your briefs, please 
limit your argument to those issues.

Deciding the Case and Reargument 

 

After all of the briefs have been filed, and depending on the procedural 
nature and complexity of the issues, the Court may direct that the case should 
be listed for oral argument or may determine that it will decide the matter 
based on the submitted briefs.  However, argument is not automatic in 
appeals of right, and if you believe oral argument is necessary you should file 
a formal request for argument explaining why your case should be argued. 

While you may have argued before an intermediate appellate court, it is 

extremely rare that pro se litigants are allowed to argue before the Supreme 
Court.  You should make every effort to clearly explain your case and legal 
argument in your briefs.   

After the Court issues a decision, if you feel the Court overlooked or 

misapprehended facts or law, you may file an Application for Reargument in 
compliance with Chapter 25 of the Rules.  As with a denied Petition for 
Allowance of Appeal, Reargument is a matter of judicial discretion, so there is 
no need to file, and the Court will not grant, a redundant argument in the form 
of an Application for Reargument.   
  

 !  Generally, any  question that  is  not  presented  for  review  during 

the briefing stage is considered waived.

Applications for Relief and Ancillary 
Motions 

 

There  are  a  number  of  petitions,  applications,  and  motions  that  are 
recognized  by  the  Rules  that  you  can  file  with  the  Supreme  Court.    The 
methods  for  filing  and  the  form  that  the  papers  are  to  take  are  specifically 
explained  in  the  rules  that  deal  with  your  specific  filing.    However,  if  you 
believe  that  your  pleading  is  not  addressed  by  the  Rules  you  should  consult 
Chapter 1 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure and file a motion 
under Pa.R.A.P. 123, Application for Relief. 

An Application for Relief has the following characteristics:

Statement of Jurisdiction – explain why the Court has the

Argument – this may be in numbered paragraphs and 
should clearly and concisely provide the procedural history,

Conclusion – with clarity and specificity state the relief that

therof); sign and date 

Exhibits – append any documents, pleadings, orders, and 
opinions that are necessary for the Court to make an

Original Jurisdiction: Mandamus, 
Prohibition, and Habeas Corpus 

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has original jurisdiction (not 
exclusive jurisdiction) to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition, and habeas 
corpus (42 Pa.C.S. §721).  This means you may seek a writ of mandamus, writ 
of prohibition, or a writ of habeas corpus directly from the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania.   

If you are filing for a writ of mandamus, writ of prohibition, or writ of 

habeas corpus in the Court’s original jurisdiction, the writs cannot be ancillary 
to matters within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (Pa.R.A.P. 
3307). 

Generally, mandamus may be used only to compel official action.  
Mandamus is appropriate relief only when you have a clear legal right, your 
opposing party has a corresponding duty, and you have no other appropriate 
and adequate remedy.  All three conditions must be present before mandamus 
is the appropriate relief.  Mandamus differs from the remedy of prohibition in 
that prohibition seeks to prohibit an inferior judicial tribunal from exercising 
jurisdiction over matters that the inferior tribunal does not legally have 
jurisdiction.   
 

This means if you request a writ of mandamus, the relief you should be 

seeking is to have the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania compel official action.  If 
you request a writ of prohibition you should be seeking to restrain or prevent 
official action. 
 

In its broadest sense, habeas corpus is a writ whose function is to 

compel the body of a person to be produced before the court for whatever 
may be essential to the proper disposition of a case.  A writ of habeas corpus is 
applicable as a means to remedy an unlawful restraint upon a person’s liberty.  
A writ of habeas corpus is appropriate when you are requesting that the 

                   

   

   

44 
 

Supreme Court examine the legality of imprisonment imposed by an inferior 
court. 

hile you may wish to file a grievance with the Court in regards to the 

manner in which your case is being handled by attempting to invoke this 
Court’s original jurisdiction, you must make a thorough legal argument that 
would compel the Court to issue a writ. 

n many instances, relief sought by invoking the Court’s original 
jurisdiction is best sought by filing another pleading at another stage in your 
case’s procedural timeline.  Seeking a writ when not appropriate may result in 
considerable delay. 

s with everything in this manual, the burden is with you to research 

and determine your best course of action.

Extraordinary Jurisdiction 

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also has extraordinary jurisdiction.  

The Supreme Court, on its own motion or upon petition of any party, may 
assume plenary jurisdiction in any matter pending before any court of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania involving an issue of immediate public 
importance.  The Court may then enter a final order or otherwise cause right 
and justice to be done (42 Pa.C.S.A. §726).  This means the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania may assume jurisdiction of a case involving an issue of 
immediate public importance.   

If you cannot demonstrate your matter is actively pending 
before an inferior jurisdiction or that it is an issue involving 
immediate public importance, you may not invoke the Court’s 
Extraordinary Jurisdiction. 
 

If,  after  review,  your  Petition  for  Extraordinary  Relief  has  been 
determined  to  contain  a  request  that  should  be  made  by 
invoking  the  Court’s  Original  Jurisdiction,  you  may  be  asked  to 
file  a  separate  Application  for  Leave  to  File  an  Original  Process 
(Pa.R.A.P. 3307) or amend your initial filing.

Formatting Rules 

One of the principal tenets of the Rules of Appellate Procedure is that all 
requests for relief must be formal in nature.  In other words, the Court cannot 
review a request written in a letter - a serious attempt must be made by the 
filer to generate a formal pleading in compliance with the Rules.  While a 
failure to comply with the Rules explored in 
this section is not necessarily fatal, violation 
may cause a delay in relief and an avoidable 
financial burden on the filers.

Filing Fees, In Forma Pauperis Forms, and 
Number of Copies 

 
The omission of the correct number of copies or a filing fee in a 
particular matter is the number one cause of delay in Pro Se-filed cases each 
year.  It is important that you understand the number of copies that are 
required of you and your financial obligation for filing in the Court.   

 

! 

While you are allowed to file an application to file a reduced 
number of copies of your pleading, the Office of the Prothonotary 
does not have the resources to provide the copies of your 
pleadings and exhibits to the Court and these applications are 
rarely granted.

for everything in this manual.

Verified Statement in Support of Continued In Forma Pauperis Status. 

 

Pa.R.A.P. 551 - Continuation of In Forma Pauperis Status for Purposes of 
Appeal. 

(a) General rule.—A party who has been granted leave by a lower court to 
proceed in forma pauperis may proceed in forma pauperis in an appellate 
court upon filing with the clerk of the lower court two copies of a verified

While all the obligations to the Court, as addressed in the Rules and in 

this manual are important, your most important obligation to ensuring an 
organized and efficient appellate review is to file in a timely manner.   

In order to preserve the filing date as the date of mailing, a Petition for 
Allowance of Appeal or Application for Reconsideration you must obtain a US 
Postal Form 3817 or other similar U.S. Postal Service form from which the 
date of deposit can be verified. All other pleadings filed with the Office of the 
Prothonotary can be preserved with an official US Postmark.  Inmate 
Postmarks or Inmate Cash Slips can also be used to preserve the date for any 
filing, as well.   

 !  Using a commercial carrier or a commercial postage machine 

will not preserve your filing date.  
 
On the next page, you will find a table that attempts to address the filing 

deadlines for all pleadings and responses addressed in Sections Two, Three, 
and Four of this manual.  Also, per Pa.R.A.P. 105, the Office of the 
Prothonotary may alter the response date for any matter filed. 

 

! 

When filing an emergency petition, you must make clear in your 
pleading the exact date and consequences of failure of the Court 
to act upon your pleading.  While the Court reserves the right to 
treat your pleading as an emergency, any pleading filed without 
an  exact  date  and  sufficient  reason  for  that  date  will  not  be 
treated as an emergency.

All filing times are calculated by the date the Court Order was exited or the date 

you were served by the opposing party – not the date you received the order or 
pleading.  You are only afforded an extra three days from the date of service if a 
party serves you by first class mail; manner of service from a court does not affect 
the filing deadline. 
**The deadline for filing a Petition for Allowance of Appeal can only be extended 
by the filing of a timely Application for Reconsideration in the intermediate court – 
an Application for Reconsideration must be filed within fourteen days (seven on a 
Children’s Fast Track).  The timely filing of an Application for Reconsideration will 
NOT extend the time for filing a Notice of Appeal and Jurisdictional Statement.
