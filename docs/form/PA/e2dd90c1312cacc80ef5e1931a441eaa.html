In this issue

Read about new judicial education resources for judges, 
legislative updates, COVID-19 impacts on caseload stats, 
county court highlights and more.

This format has allowed children to participate, in what 
might normally be a confusing and stressful hearing, from 
where they are comfortable. 

Additionally, the ease with which most children are able 
to use phones and tablets make it so that children are 
able to speak directly to the judge in a very casual and 
authentic manner (rather than in a formal, and sometimes 
intimidating courtroom setting). 

nother unforeseen benefit of these virtual hearings 
has been that they can help spare victims of domestic 
violence from the stressful experience of having to be 
in the same room as their abuser. In New York, family 
courts are considering making virtual hearings available 
to litigants seeking protection orders even after the 
pandemic is over. 

  A

For all the inevitable glitches and technical issues that 
come with anything virtual, this solution seems to help 
make the court system more accessible for a group of 
traditionally vulnerable court users. While the future 
use of technology in the courts after the pandemic may 
vary by jurisdiction, many states have already begun 
discussing it as a permanent solution for some cases. 

The accidental 
upside of virtual 
hearings
Putting children and trauma 
victims at ease 

While a number of courts have recently started to 
resume in-person hearings, some courts have found 
that conducting dependency proceedings via video 
conference continues to offer some advantages for 
children and families.

“What we’ve heard from judges is that children are 
generally very comfortable with the virtual forum – and 
courts are even seeing many more parents in attendance 
as transportation and child care are no longer an issue,” 
said Sandra Moore
Courts director.

Human-trafficking Benchcard

Restitution Benchbook
Restitution Benchbook

A new resource for judges, the 
Pennsylvania Human Trafficking 
Judicial Benchcard, was sent to 
Common Pleas and Magisterial 
District judges across the state 
at the end of July. 

Developed by the AOPC 
and the Institute to Address 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation 
at The Villanova University 
Charles Widger School of 
Law, the benchcard highlights 
important definitions and sections of Pennsylvania’s anti-
trafficking laws and reflects the recent changes in the law 
that went into effect on April 6, 2020.

As victims of human trafficking are frequently arrested 
and charged with crimes, the resource includes a list of 
the most common offenses victims have been charged 
with and indicates those crimes that are eligible to be 
vacated. 

The benchcard also provides useful insight into the crimes 
of sex and labor trafficking by listing the locations and 
types of businesses where trafficking most often occurs, 
as well as victim indicators that can be observed in a 
court setting. 

“We hope this benchcard will help identify potential 
victims of human trafficking and encourage using trauma-
informed practices when presiding over human trafficking 
Amy Kehner, Judicial District Operations and 
cases,” said Amy Kehner
Programs administrator. 

The new resource was created using STOP Grant funds – 
federal grant money annually administered through the 
Office of Violence against Women (OVW) to help enhance 
efforts to combat violence against women. 

2020

The benchcard was developed to serve as a companion 
piece to the continuing education session on human 
trafficking held by the Minor Judiciary Education Board 
(MJEB) last year, in addition to the series of four webinars 
recently offered to court staff. 

To request copies of this benchcard at no charge to 
Pennsylvania judges and court staff, please email  
Amy.Kehner@pacourts.us. 

Also to be distributed to all 
Common Pleas judges across 
the state, the first edition of 
the Pennsylvania Restitution 
Benchbook aims to provide best 
practices for judges to consider 
when imposing restitution.

The benchbook examines 
the basic principles and 
concepts when restitution must 
be addressed and includes 

procedural checklists for judges to reference at the 
various phases of prosecution – at sentencing, in juvenile 
court and as a condition of probation.

The Advisory Council on
Elder Justice in the Courts
and
The Administrative Office
of Pennsylvania Courts

This month, the Advisory Council 
on Elder Justice in the Courts 
published the first edition of 
the Pennsylvania Guardianship 
Benchbook in an effort to help 
judges navigate the complex 
issues involved in guardianship 
cases.

“Determinations of whether a 
guardianship is appropriate, 
or how to arrive at the least 

restrictive form of guardianship, involves the striking of 
a balance between protection and autonomy, and has 
always been a challenging inquiry,” PA Supreme Court 
Justice Debra Todd

Debra Todd explained.

This benchbook outlines the laws pertaining to 
guardianships, offers alternatives to guardianships 
and provides guidance on how to identify and appoint 
guardians. It reflects the accumulated wisdom of judges 
and practitioners who focus on guardianships and will 
serve as a valuable resource for Pennsylvania’s Orphans’ 
Court judges.

Legislative roundup by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

Budget
Budget

Expungement and Clean Slate 
Expungement and Clean Slate 

As noted in the prior roundup, a five-month budget was 
adopted in May to fund state operations, including those 
of the Judiciary. The legislature must pass legislation 
funding the remaining seven months of the 2020-21 fiscal 
year by November 30. This day represents not only the 
end of the stop-gap budget timeframe, but it is also the 
day the legislature will adjourn marking the end of the 
current session. 

House Bill 440 expands the expungement statute to 
include judicial determinations of full acquittals, and the 
Clean Slate limited access provisions to include pardons. 
The legislation passed the House unanimously and is 
pending in the Senate, where it is likely to pass in the 
coming weeks. The bill also ensures that restitution and 
automation fees are fully paid before a defendant is 
eligible for either limited access or clean slate limited 
access.

Probation reform 
Probation reform 

It is likely that some reform measures will pass and 
be enacted into law before the end of the session. 
House Bill 1555 and Senate Bill 14 and similar reform 
proposals. Elements of the bills include modification of 
probation conditions, parameters for total confinement 
upon revocation, probation review conferences and 
administrative probation for failure to pay restitution. 
The Senate unanimously passed SB 14, and it has been 
referred to the House Judiciary Committee. House Bill 
1555 was moved from the House Judiciary Committee and 
is pending on second consideration. 

COLA suspension
COLA suspension

Custody
Custody

Senate Bill 868 makes several substantive changes to 
the custody statute, with a focus on the health and safety 
of the child. The changes include modifying the custody 
factors and adding offenses to the list of crimes that, when 
committed by a party or a member of the household, must 
be considered by the court before it issues a custody 
order. Further, the legislation allows the AOPC to develop 
training for judges, court personnel, guardians ad litem, 
counsel for children, masters and meditators, focusing 
on abuse, bias, trauma and neglect. The legislation was 
unanimously passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee – 
its long-term prospects for passage are not yet known.

House Bill 2487 was passed unanimously by the House 
and the Senate. As of this writing, it is expected to be 
signed by the governor. The bill precludes a COLA of 
compensation in 2021 for public officials in the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches. The legislation was 
passed in light of the budget shortfall facing the state 
because of the pandemic. 

District attorney vacancies
District attorney vacancies

Act 78 of 2020 was signed by the governor on Sept. 
28. The act amends the County Code to modify how 
vacancies in the office of district attorney are filled in 
fourth through eighth class counties. Under the act, when 
a vacancy occurs the judges of the Court of Common 

contiguous territory as nearly equal in population as 
practicable.” 

Additionally, the General Assembly by law must establish 
a transition to an appellate court judiciary elected from 
judicial districts, the effect of set judicial districts upon 
eligibility to seek retention, the order in which judicial 
districts shall elect appellate court jurists and the 
decennial realignment of the appellate judicial districts 
beginning in 2021. Unlike the constitutional amendment, 
any processes that must be established by law require 
the assent of the governor. 

Late last year the House passed the bill by a vote of 102-
95. On July 15 this year, the Senate passed the bill 26-24. 
This was the first of two required legislative passages. 
The proposal must pass in the same form in the next 
legislative session, which commences on Jan. 5, 2021. The 
earliest a question can be on the ballot is the municipal 
primary on May 18, 2021. 

Coming Up: 
Coming Up: 

It is expected between now and Nov. 30 the legislature 
will: 

Pass a 2020-21 General Appropriations Act and the 
required mechanical bills – i.e., Fiscal and Administrative 
Codes – for the remaining seven months of the fiscal year. 
This could include further disbursement of Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding

Debate current proposals and amendments to the 
probation reform bills

Address other pending legislation discussed herein that 
is part of the end-of-session bill trade list negotiated 
between the legislative chambers

{Damian Wachter, Esq. is the assistant director 
of Legislative Affairs.}

Pleas must appoint the first assistant district attorney 
(ADA) to fill the vacancy upon a showing that he/she 
satisfies the county residency, age, citizenship and bar 
admittance requirements for district attorneys outlined 
in the County Code. If the first ADA is unwilling or unable 
to serve, or does not satisfy the requirements under law, 
the judges of the Court of Common Pleas must appoint a 
competent person who does. 

Expert testimony
Expert testimony

House Bill 2175 and Senate Bill 1170 expand the list of 
sexual offenses for which experts may testify in sexual 
assault cases to assist the trier of fact in understanding 
the dynamics of sexual violence, victim responses to 
sexual violence and the impact of sexual violence on 
victims during and after the assault.  The bills passed their 
respective chambers unanimously and are pending in the 
other chamber. One of the bills will likely receive a final 
floor vote and be sent to the governor before the end of 
session.

Veterans and commerce courts
Veterans and commerce courts

Senate Bill 976 specifically enumerates Veterans 
Courts within the current law governing problem-solving 
courts. The bill allows for participation by out-of-county 
defendants in established Veterans Courts and the 
establishment of multi-county Veterans Courts. It also 
allows for the use of veterans tracks – programs within 
other treatment courts that utilize components of a 
Veterans Court such as treatment and mentors in judicial 
districts that otherwise do not have the population and/or 
resources to sustain a full Veterans court. The bill passed 
the Senate unanimously. It was amended in House 
Judiciary with the provisions of House Bill 332, a bill that 
allows the Superior Court and Courts of Common Pleas 
to establish commerce court programs. The legislation 
is expected to receive a final vote in the House when it 
returns, after which the Senate will have to concur in the 
House amendments. 

Appellate judicial districts
Appellate judicial districts

House Bill 196 is a proposed constitutional amendment 
changing the way appellate court jurists are selected 
from statewide elections to district elections. Under 
the proposed amendment, the Supreme Court shall be 
elected from seven judicial districts and the Superior and 
Commonwealth Courts shall be elected from judicial 
districts. The districts would be established by law and 
the number of jurists elected from districts “shall provide 
every resident … with approximately equal representation 
on a court … [and] shall be composed of compact and 

‘Save Your Home’ program 
provides lifeline to struggling 
homeowners in Allegheny County 

During the month of August, Allegheny County courts 
reviewed over 250 cases of homeowners facing mortgage 
foreclosure while in the midst of a pandemic.

A result of a collaboration with the county executive, 
sheriff, Department of Court Records and the Fifth Judicial 
District, the ‘Save Your Home’ Program has allowed them 
to do so remotely and without subjecting court users to an 
over-crowded courtroom.

Because of this program, Allegheny County residents 
in danger of losing their homes and being evicted now 
have a way to remotely attend remote conciliations and 
conferences with their lenders using any electronic device 
available– iPhone, landline, tablet etc. 

This program was first established as a specialty court 
within the Civil Court Division during the Great Recession 
and mortgage crisis of 2007-2009. 

“The real 
power of the 
program is I can 
stop the foreclosure while 
we explore alternative ways 
to try to save homes,” Judge 
McVay said. “I’m looking 
for any possible change in 
circumstances that gives me 
hope that the home can be 
saved, such as the person 
reclaiming an old job or 
finding a new one.”

Allegheny County Judge Jack McVay Jr.
over the program, explained its importance and 
effectiveness.

Jack McVay Jr., who presides 

He estimates that the program has saved at least 100 
homes per year since it started.

The new convenience of the program has also reduced 
the need to take off work or arrange child care, and may 
relieve elderly borrowers from the stress of traveling to an 
in-person appearance. 

Additionally, most defendants do not have attorneys and 
are of limited financial resources and appreciate their 
cases being reviewed safely, inexpensively and remotely. 

“We as a court are prioritizing public safety, but 
simultaneously serving the public constitutionally by 
holding court,” Judge McVay said. 

Resources to help your court during 
and after the pandemic

The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) Pandemic 
Rapid Response Team (RRT), a group of chief justices and 
state court administrators established in March, has been 
working for months to give state courts information to help 
them operate more efficiently during – and after – the 
pandemic. 

RRT and its six working groups have produced an 
enormous amount of work. Here’s some examples of what 
a few of the groups have done to help courts:

•  Civil – This working group tackled the problem of 

backlogs and an anticipated surge in civil filings due to 
the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This 
document describes 12 practical steps to make civil 
case processing more efficient and fairer to litigants.

•  Appellate – As the pandemic began, state appellate 

courts almost immediately adapted to conducting oral 
arguments remotely. This resource provides guidance 
on what courts have done that has worked well. 

•  Children, Families and Elders – In response to stay-at-
home orders in the spring, courthouses in most states 
were closed for in-person proceedings – creating a 
huge backlog of cases. This group has produced a 
document that offers creative solutions to help courts 
stay on top of backlogs and the anticipated surge in 
filings. 

• 

Technology – RRT has adopted six principles to 
guide decisions for court leaders as they integrate 
technology into their courts.

During the Pandemic 
During the Pandemic 

NCSC recently held a webinar on Sept. 23 focusing 
on good case management of guardianships and 
conservatorships during the pandemic. 

Speakers included judges - including Montgomery 
County Orphans’ Court Judge Lois Murphy
along with both an experienced guardian and 
attorney, who discussed how to effectively monitor 
guardianship cases. 

Lois Murphy - 

Also discussed during the webinar was how to 
decide whether a hearing should be held virtually 
vs. in-person, and speakers outlined best practices 
for judges, guardians and attorneys to follow 
during such virtual hearings.

better court services, says CCJ/COSCA

The coronavirus pandemic has led to inconvenience, 
unprecedented case backlogs and issues that the nation’s 
state courts haven’t faced since the influenza pandemic of 
1918-19. It has also led to opportunity.

The Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ) and Conference 
of State Court Administrators (COSCA) urge state court 
officials to view the pandemic with a glass-half-full

going forward.

Here are the six principles and some steps court officials 
can take to implement them:

Courtroom to classroom 

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s Commission on 
Judicial Independence (PACJI) is launching a new initiative 
later this fall to get elementary and secondary aged 
students excited about civics education. 

As the 2020 school year presents unique challenges 
to teachers, students and parents alike, many schools 
are opting to return using virtual instruction – either 
completely or blending with in-person. 

As a way to continue on with their mission of promoting 
civics education, the Commission will be working with local 
judges to virtually visit classrooms and talk to students 
about the role of the courts and the work they do as a 
jurist.

AOPC/Communications is partnering with the Commission 
to develop materials for teachers to use as they teach 
their classes about the three branches of government – 
specifically emphasizing meaningful information about the 
work, role and importance of the judiciary. 

In partnering with legislators and other civics-focused 
groups, the Commission has reached out to civics and 
government teachers across the state to aid in developing 
materials. 

The goal is for these materials to become accessible for 
widespread use across the state by working with those 
school districts and the PA Department of Education (PDE) 
– who will be able to upload the resources on a statewide 
teacher portal. 

Reaching survivors during Domestic 
Violence Awareness Month 

Funded by the STOP Grant, AOPC will again create and 
run a digital ad campaign on Facebook and Google 
beginning in the month of October. 

The ads target survivors of domestic violence using a 
positive message that help is available, and pointing them 

to the pacourts.us/learn webpage for information and 
videos on how to file for a protection order.

View the campaign soon on our PA Courts Facebook page

Delco juror donation program  
hits $1 million mark

Back in 2000, Delaware County 
District Court Administrator Jerry 
Jerry 
Montella
Montella first had the idea to bring a 
juror donation program to the county 
after reading about similar programs. 

“We were having an issue with jurors 
who would often forget about the 
check they received and not cash 
it,” Montella explained. “We thought 
jurors might be willing to simply 
donate their minimal stipend.” 

Montella said he was hoping that the 
first year of the program would yield 
around $1,000 in donations, but one 
year after the program launched in 
2003, results immediately exceeded 
expectations with jurors donating over 
$50,000. 

Nearly 16 years later, around 100,000 
jurors have donated their stipend of 
$9.00 plus mileage, totaling over $1 
million.

The donations are allocated to efforts 
supporting at-risk and/or special-
needs children in the county, and 
have expanded to support UNICEF 
and Red Cross for Hurricane Relief. 

Some of the most popular 
organizations jurors donate to 
include Children and Youth Services 
(40%), Hero Scholarship Fund (20%), 
Domestic Abuse (24%), Operation 
Warm (6%), Court Appointed Special 
Advisors (CASA) (8%) and the  
YMCA (2%).

“I would like to thank the thousands 
of Delaware County jurors for their 
generosity and service over the years 
in which they have assisted children 
with special needs across our county 
neighborhoods,” Montella said. 

“On this recognition of the Delaware 
County juror donation program 
reaching the $1 million contribution 
benchmark, the board of judges 
gratefully acknowledges and whole 
heartedly commends District Court 
Administrator Jerry Montella for 
conceiving of such an idea and 
shepherding the program to its 
current, most impressive and highly 
successful status,” Delaware County 
President Judge Kevin Kelly

Kevin Kelly said.

COVID-19 impacts on caseloads – 
early observations

Every business, institution and organization has been 
notably affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in one way 
or another – and the justice system has not been immune. 
The figures below represent preliminary data assembled 
from judicial case management systems, and other state 
agencies.

The AOPC examined the filings and dispositions for the 
three years prior to the 2020 judicial emergency and 
calculated a baseline average of an expected volume of 
cases. This baseline was compared to the actual filings 
in the months of the judicial emergency. The difference 
shows the significant impact of the pandemic on court 
operations.

Crime and Court Filings 
Crime and Court Filings 

In late June, PA State Police reported that total calls for 
service were 14 percent higher than pre-COVID baseline 
levels (in late Feb.) – a leveling of the sharp increases of 
up to 84 percent in the early months of the pandemic.

According to PA State Police COVID-19 Statistics, total 
arrests in late June were 70 percent lower than pre-COVID 
levels. Like arrests, traffic citations also decreased. 

The number of citations filed this past July were 35 percent 
fewer than in past years. At the beginning of the pandemic, 

citation filings were at their lowest, showing a decrease of 
86 percent (April 2020). 

As expected, fewer arrests and citations translate 
into fewer case filings. Year-to-date criminal filings 
in Magisterial District Courts are down 19 percent as 
compared to recent years, and Philadelphia Municipal 
Court is down 39 percent. 

Children, Families and Elders
Children, Families and Elders

Preliminary Common Pleas data show that petitions for 
child custody, Protection from Abuse orders, guardianships 
and adoptions all decreased significantly. 

Custody filings decreased 34 percent compared to 
baseline years, and Protection from Abuse petitions 
decreased 28 percent. 

Compared to baseline years, guardianship filings have 
decreased 19 percent and adoptions have decreased 41 
percent.

Troublingly, PA Dept. of Human Services Statistics show 
that calls to ChildLine to report potential abuse or neglect 
had decreased by 40 percent in May 2020 compared to 
May 2019. This has been a concern among experts who 
say this decrease in calls likely doesn’t mean a decrease 
in child abuse – only in its reporting.

It runs in 
the family 

Dauphin County President 
Judge John Cherry 
John Cherry (PJ 
Cherry) and Clearfield 
County Judge Paul Cherry 
Paul Cherry 
(Judge Cherry) both 
followed in the footsteps 
of their father, Judge 
John A. Cherry
John A. Cherry – the 
former president judge of 
Clearfield County from 
1964–‘74. 

The humble, hard-working 
son of a first-generation 
immigrant from Italy, their 
father instilled in his six 
children a deep respect and 
appreciation for the law 
from a young age. 

PJ Cherry was 13 years old 
when he vividly remembers 
his father being sworn in as 
a judge, and it was around 
that same time that his 
younger brother Paul, just 
six years old, first knew he 
wanted to be a judge. 

“I was in the first grade and 
my teacher wanted us to 
do an art project on what 
we wanted to be when we 
grew up,” Judge Cherry 
said. “I remember cutting 
out a robe in construction 
paper and putting that on 
the person, and I actually 
kept that and 40 years later 
brought it with me to my 
swearing in.”

He recalled one piece 
of advice from his father 
that has stuck with him 
throughout his career – to 
“be firm, but fair.” 

Reflecting on his own path 
to the bench, PJ Cherry 
explained that it was an 
opportunity given to their 
father back in the 1930’s 
that would shape the 
course of the Cherry family 

for generations to come. 

After their father asked 
former Dickinson Law Dean 
Harrison Hitchler for a part-
time janitorial job to help 
put himself through school, 
the dean instead invited 
him to come live and work 
in his home.

It was in the coming months 
and years that Dean 
Hitchler became one of the 
greatest influences on their 
father’s life and a close 
family friend. 

Since then, nine Cherrys 
have attended Dickinson 
Law – including PJ Cherry’s 
son (also named John), and 
Judge Cherry’s son (Nick) 
– who is currently studying 
there with plans to become 
the 18th lawyer in the Cherry 
family. 

“Frankly, my father was 
the greatest man I’ve ever 
known,” said PJ Cherry. “All 
we had to do was watch 
my father to see how he 
lived-filled with honor and 
compassion. He taught 
us that it’s all about the 
opportunities you are given 
and making the most of 
them.”

In 2004 and again in 2014, 
PJ Cherry swore in his 
brother Paul as a judge in 
the same Clearfield County 
courtroom that their father 
presided in over 50 years 
ago. 

“Every time I’m presiding 
in Courtroom #1, I see 
the picture of my father 
hanging on the wall directly 
in front of the bench and it’s 
a constant reminder to treat 
everyone fairly,” Judge 

Clearfield County President Judge John A. Cherry (father)

John Cherry (l) and Clearfield County 

Cherry said. “And every day 
I try to duplicate my father’s 
values.” 

Their roles reversed in the 
beginning of this year when 
Judge Cherry was the one 
swearing his brother John 
in for his third term, this time 
as president judge – taking 
on the same role that their 

father was once a great 
exemplar. 

“I’ve learned that it’s not 
being a lawyer or a judge 
that makes you like your 
dad, it’s being the person 
he was, and I’m working on 
that every day,” PJ Cherry 
said.

Aiding 
access to 
justice

Berks County received nearly 7,000 
requests for court interpreters in 
2018 alone – more than any other 
county in the state that year. 

In an effort to meet the significant 
demand for court interpreters in 
their community, the Berks County 
Bar Association partnered with 
the AOPC to develop a 14-week 
interpreter training program. 

Patricia Luna-Heisse, a Spanish 
interpreter on the AOPC roster, is 
a clear-cut success story of the 
program. 

Patricia’s husband, Lancaster County 
Magisterial District Judge Jonathan 
Jonathan 
Heisse
Heisse, encouraged her to first start 
the process after listening to AOPC 
Interpreter Certification Coordinator 
Natalia Petrova
Natalia Petrova speak about the 
important role of court interpreters at 
MJEB’s New Judge School in 2018. 

Having previously graduated from 
law school in Peru, Patricia’s legal 
background, coupled with her 
recent experience interpreting for a 
company that contracted with school 
districts and courthouses in and 
around Lancaster County, made her 
an ideal candidate for the program. 

That summer, she attended the 
AOPC interpreter orientation 
where she learned that Berks 
County was offering a workshop 
to help participants prepare for all 
the examinations involved in the 
intensive certification process. 

Tom Gran, another Spanish 
interpreter on the AOPC roster who 
just recently finished the certification 
process himself, led the program. 

“We were really lucky to have him 
– he taught us what to expect from 
all the examinations, how everything 
was going to work and really pushed 
us to study,” Patricia explained. 

“It is being involved with the Berks 
program that helped me make 
the decision to continue with the 
certification process and go forward 
with the examination - I am very 
thankful for this program.”

After graduating from the program 
in Nov. 2018, Patricia went on 
to successfully complete her 
examinations and officially became 
a certified court interpreter in July 
2019.

“I am glad to be able to 
help people who aren’t able 
to communicate in English 
when they are going 
through different situations 
that are really serious and 
important – it makes me 
happy to be their voice and 
it makes me proud of the 
job that I do,” Patricia said.

“It’s not easy but it’s rewarding – not 
only personally but professionally. 
People are really thankful for what 
you do for them and the judges 
really respect the importance of 
your job and let you know that on a 
daily basis,” she said. 

Berks County Bar Association is 
currently planning their third training 
for this fall.
