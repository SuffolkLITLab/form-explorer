Lackawanna County Treatment Court 
receives $2 million grant 

Lackawanna County Treatment Court will receive a nearly 
$2 million grant over a five-year period from the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA). 

U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, a member of the House 
Appropriations Committee, announced the grant in a 
press release in early June saying, “Treatment courts 
offer rehabilitation and compassion, and the hard work of 
the program participants and dedication of the mentors 
yield real results. They are proven to be both effective at 
reducing people’s chance of sliding back into addiction, 
and cost-efficient.” 

abuse and mental health issues get the treatment and 
support they need,” said President Judge Barrasse. 

Lackawanna County is proud to exemplify how evidence-
based treatment and an individual’s commitment to 
recovery can bring life-altering changes to families and 
the community. We celebrate a recovery community that 
restores families and makes Lackawanna County a better 
place to live.” 

A branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, SAMHSA provides funding to organizations to 
support community-based substance abuse treatment and 
recovery services through their grant programs. 

Under the direction of Lackawanna County President Judge 
Michael Barrasse, Lackawanna County Treatment Court has 
been recognized as one of the top 25 in the country.

The court will receive nearly $400,000 in the first 
disbursement of the grant next year.

“The recognition and financial support from SAMHSA will 
allow us to help individuals who suffer from substance

Allegheny Family Court 
builds playground 

The courthouse setting can be an intimidating one – 
especially for children who have experienced trauma or who 
are experiencing the court system for the first time. 

their research, students presented their results and 
recommendations in December 2019 to court staff and 
stakeholders.

Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Jennifer 
McCrady has been involved in discussions about ideas 
for modifications to the courthouse to help make it a more 
trauma-informed environment.  

In 2017, those discussions eventually led to a partnership 
with the Allegheny Family Court, Allegheny County 
Department of Human Services and design students 
from Carnegie Mellon University to come up with ways to 
improve court experience.

While several recommendations were made, Judge 
McCrady explained that they prioritized ideas that they 
thought could be easily implemented – one of which was 
the playground behind the Family Law Center where family 
court is held.

“The playground will provide an opportunity for families to 
be together in a more natural environment and hopefully 
reduce their stress while waiting for their court case,” Judge 
McCrady said.

As part of the semester-long sponsorship, students 
observed court activities and resources, and conducted 
surveys and focus groups with stakeholders including 
children, parents and court staff. After completing 

Installation was slated to begin in mid-February, however 
COVID-19 delayed these plans and the project was 
completed the week of July 19.

Where and how to resume jury trials

AOPC recently held an open-forum 
webinar for court administrators and 
jury managers to discuss ideas for the 
different procedures and processes 
involved with resuming jury trials. 

The primary challenge most courts 
face for resuming jury trials – space.  

District Court Administrators (DCAs) 
discussed their courts’ need and 
interest in working closely with 
community leaders to solve the 
logistical challenges presented 
by the pandemic. Through those 
communications, many courts are 
finding alternative facilities. 

For example, Bradford County and 
Snyder/Union Counties are using high 
school gymnasiums for jury selection, 
whereas Franklin County is holding 
a jury selection and criminal trial in a 
theatre.

Another method that some courts 
will likely apply to resume jury 
selection is the jury pool per case 
selection process (which may not 
be as economically efficient, but 
is safer because fewer people are 
involved and each juror spends less 
time at the court facility). This process 
tends to produce a greater sense of 
appreciation and perhaps trust among 
jurors toward the court.

The prevailing lesson learned for court 
administrators and jury managers is 
the number of trials a court may try at 
one time is significantly smaller than it 
was pre-pandemic. 

The webinar concluded with reference 
to the wide variety of helpful 
resources created by NCSC to help 
state courts deal with challenges 
presented by the pandemic. 

Several polls were conducted during 
the webinar to get an idea of where 
judicial districts currently stand on the 
resumption of jury trials. 

“Restarting jury trials in Pa” Polling Results  
Polling responses below represent where county courts currently stand (as of July 22, 2020) on resuming in-person jury trials  
and the ideas they may be considering. Responses don’t necessarily indicate adopted protocols. 

Please indicate your current status 
with restarting jury selections

Are you, or will you be, using an 
alternate facility for jury selections?

NOTE: 46 out of 60 judicial districts (77 percent) were represented in the polling responses

Have all court partners and 
stakeholders been advised of 
the restarting plans for juries?

Jury summons 
mailing will include:

Since the restart, the response 
rate/failure to appear for jury 
summons has:

NOTE: 34 out of 60 judicial districts (56 percent) were represented in the polling responses.

Are you making changes to your 
jury service process (e.g., move from 
weekly trials to one day/one trial?)

Are you installing plexiglass 
shields in the witness box?

Are you providing clear masks 
or face shields for jurors?

 NOTE: 37 judicial districts (62 percent) were represented in the responses.

Mock jury exercise helps Chester County 
Courts prepare to resume jury trials 

Operational drills are 
designed to simulate real-
life experiences. These 
drills, in theory, point out 
omissions and faults in 
processes and procedures. 

Pennsylvania’s 15th judicial 
district, Chester County, 
conducted such a drill 
on Thurs., July 23rd at the 
Chester County Justice 
Center. An additional drill 
took place at its historic 
courthouse on July 30th. 

The purpose of this drill: 
what will jury trials look 
like and how will the court 
conduct such a trial in 
the face of a pandemic 
where social distancing 
is required, and available 
space is severely curtailed? 

The drill took participants 
through all phases of jury 
service – reporting for 
duty at the Justice Center, 
attending juror orientation 
in a jury assembly room 
with reconfigured seating, 
moving jurors to a 
courtroom for voir dire, and 
concluding with a mock 
presentation of a trial. 

Participants included representatives from the 
district attorney, public defender, sheriff and 
clerk of courts offices as well as court staff. 

By conducting this drill, the court reconfigured 
its courtroom seating to accommodate jurors 
as to not place a juror in an uncomfortable 
location. Additionally, the use of face shields 
or masks by participants when communicating 
through the court’s sound system was 
resolved.

The drill, spearheaded by Common Pleas 
Judge David Bortner and District Court 
Administrator Patricia Norwood-Foden was 
evaluated as enlightening and successful. The 
true verdict, pardon the pun, will be when real 
jurors report for service, planned for Aug. 3.

Re-starting jury 
trials in Pa

Early in 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic significantly curtailed 
nearly every aspect of our society. The court system was 
not immune. For a time, only the most critical court functions 
were performed across the Commonwealth. 

However, the justice system cannot stay frozen indefinitely.  
Slowly, and with the utmost concern for public health, court 
operations have begun to resume, including jury trials as 
guaranteed by the U.S. and Pennsylvania constitutions. 

In May, the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges 
and the AOPC collaborated in developing guidance and 
suggested best practices for trial courts to consider in 
resuming jury trials. 

Chaired by Judge Terence Nealon, the Jury Trial Working 
Group reviewed the work of similar bodies across the 
country, and carefully considered public health advisories 
and protocols. The Working Group Report, issued in June, 
focused on four areas: 

(1)  Preparing courthouses for the return of staff, jurors, and 
other members of the public in the wake of COVID-19
(2)  Summoning prospective jurors, notifying them of new 

protocols to promote their safety, and obtaining relevant 
COVID-19 information that may affect their ability to serve 
as jurors 

(3)  Selecting juries, both in-person and virtually through 

advanced communication technology

(4)  Conducting jury trials.

York County’s first 
female president judge 

In the beginning of June, Judge Maria Musti Cook 
was unanimously chosen by her 14 fellow common 
pleas judges to become York County’s first female 
president judge.

Judge Musti Cook previously made York County 
history as the first female president of the county 
bar association in 1995. Since then, she has 
gained nearly 15 years of experience serving on 
the York County bench since January 2006 — 
most recently as the supervising judge for the 
county’s criminal and family court divisions. 

“This background has given me a breadth of 
experience that will be important in the role of 
PJ.  I am honored to have the support of my fellow 
judges. I am pleased and proud to be the first 
woman to serve as PJ in York County, especially in 
this year of the 100th anniversary of the passage 
of the 19th amendment.  Giving women the right to 
vote opened innumerable doors and we continue 
to strive for being a part of all important decision-
making,” said Judge Musti Cook. 

“Our Commonwealth and nation have faced 
extraordinary challenges during the past three 
months addressing COVID-19. We have needed 
to be flexible and open to new ways of insuring 
access to our courts. We have had to think outside 
the box and we have learned valuable lessons. We 
need to take that innovation and lessons learned 
through this year and into the years that follow to 
improve access to justice for all people.”

Judge Musti Cook will be sworn in and begin her 
five-year term as PJ on Jan. 2, 2021.

Behind Hamlet, there are little stuffed animal Hamlets that his coordinator, Karen 
Andreadis and Judge Jeffery Wright sell to generate revenue for his care. 

Happy Birthday Hamlet!  

Lancaster County’s Treatment Court service dog, Hamlet, 
celebrated his 8th birthday in June. 

Hamlet joined the Lancaster County Courthouse as a facility dog 
in 2014, where he assists in the Veterans, Mental Health and 
Drug Treatment Courts to help reduce anxiety and tension for 
participants. 

Hamlet was trained by Susquehanna Service Dogs (SSD) in 
Harrisburg – a program of Keystone Human Services Children 
and Family Services that trains and provides service dogs. Hamlet 
was the second treatment court dog placed by SSD following 
Buster’s placement in the York County Courthouse a year prior in 
2013.  

Several treatment courts now use Susquehanna Service Dogs to 
get a therapy dog for their treatment court.

Setup for ICP oral exam held on June 10.

Interpreters continue certification 
process during COVID

While the pandemic has caused ongoing challenges and 
changes for everyone, court interpreter candidates continue 
to progress through the certification process thanks to the 
flexibility of the Interpreter Certification Program (ICP) team. 

Allegheny County Court’s Greg Sykes and Interpreter 
Certification Coordinator Natalia Petrova proctored the 
exam to 15 interpreters of Arabic, American sign language, 
French, Nepali, Russian and Spanish.

Originally scheduled to be held in April in Philadelphia, the 
ICP held its first written exam of 2020 in Western PA on 
June 10.

A necessary step towards interpreter certification, the 
exam cannot be given remotely – so when Butler County 
entered the green phase in early June, Butler County DCA 
Erica Cihonski recommended a nearby hotel as the exam 
location.

Fortunately, most of the examinees were from western 
PA, where courts are in dire need of interpreters, and 
preliminary results have shown that 2/3 of the group have 
passed the first part of the exam.

A few weeks later, the ICP held their oral exam on June 25. 
According to NCSC protocols, oral exams must be taken in 
person, so all possible safety precautions were once again 
taken for the in-person test. 

Social distancing, extra capacity and sanitizing of the exam 
room, wearing PPE and all other precautions recommended 
by the CDC were observed during the exam.

The next upcoming Orientation Workshop was scheduled 
to be held in Harrisburg, but due to restrictions on public 
gatherings and as a preventative measure, it was held 
online on July 18-19.

The legislature met in May, June and part of July, with many members continuing to vote 
remotely due to COVID-19. The General Assembly has recessed for the summer and the 
recess is scheduled to last until mid-September.  Traditionally in an election year, the fall 
schedule is limited to about four weeks. Because of the status of the budget (see below), it is 
expected the General Assembly will convene voting sessions on several additional days this 
fall, including after the Nov. 3 general election. 

Budget

On May 29, the governor approved Act 1A of 2020, which 
became effective on July 1. As a result of the COVID-19 
shutdown and the impact it had on revenues, Act 1A is a five-
month “flat-fund” budget, funding at a level of approximately 
41.7 percent of the 2019-20 budget. For the Judiciary, it 
constituted $148.2 million in state funds. Under the plan, 
the state budget is funded through November, requiring 
the legislature to adopt a second budget – likely sometime 
after the election – to fund the remaining seven months. The 
state is facing a $3.2 billion shortfall. 

The governor also approved Act 23 of 2020, extending 
the statutory surcharges that augment state funds for the 
general operations of the Judiciary through Dec. 31, 2021.   

Federal CARES in response to COVID-19

The Coronavirus Relief Fund provided $150 billion in direct 
aid to state and local governments. Funding was based on 
population with a minimum payment of $1.25 billion. Forty-
five percent was set aside for local governments (including 
counties) with populations exceeding 500,000. The relief 
funds were allocated for necessary expenditure due to 
COVID-19 and incurred March 1, 2020, through Dec. 30, 
2020. 

As noted in the prior newsletter, justice-related initiatives 
funding totaling $850 million was allocated via the Byrne/
JAG funding formula to “prevent, prepare for and respond 
to coronavirus.” Pennsylvania received $17 million, which will 
be disbursed by PCCD in two phases, the first through the 
county Criminal Justice Advisory Boards. 

Additionally, Act 2A of 2020 was signed by the governor 
on May 29. The act allocates $2.6 of $3.9 billion in 
federal CARES funds. Additional federal money remains 
and the General Assembly continues to examine ways 
to allocate it. Act 2A appropriated CARES funds to the 

Departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human 
Services, Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, 
Pennsylvania Housing and Finance Agency, Department of 
Community and Economic Development, the State System 
of Higher Education and the Pennsylvania Higher Education 
Assistance Agency.

Probation Reform 

The legislature continues its work on reforming county 
probation. Readers will recall that the House Judiciary 
Committee moved the House version of reform legislation 
– HB 1555 – at the end of 2019. The bill has since stalled. 
The Senate version – SB 14 – was passed unanimously by 
the Senate on July 15, and referred to the House Judiciary 
Committee. Briefly, the bill:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 
Modifies probation conditions on familial responsibility 
 
and requires courts to allow probationers to 
temporarily leave the jurisdiction 

 
Prohibits revocation of probation solely for nonpayment 
 
of fines and costs

 
Allows total confinement upon revocation of probation 
 
only upon the commission of a new crime, or upon 
a technical violation when specific conditions are met – 
confinement under this scenario is subject to limits

Establishes a process for probation review conferences, 
 
 
wherein generally after three years of probation for 
misdemeanors or five years for felonies, probationers 
are eligible for review conferences 

Establishes administrative probation for cases where 
 
 
courts do not terminate probation because the 
probationer has failed to pay restitution in full.

The House version addresses similar issues, but also 
includes provisions on use of medical marijuana while on

(continued)

11BudgetThe governor proposed the 2020-21 budget on Feb. 4. With the exception of a slight increase in the Judicial Conduct Board line, the proposal maintains state funding for the judiciary at the same level as the current fiscal year. Probation Reform and Justice Reinvestment Initiative Two (JRI 2) Legislation advancing reforms to the probation system remains a topic of discussion in 2020. In late 2019, the House Judiciary Committee amended and advanced House Bill 1555. As amended, the bill addresses numerous issues including:• Medical marijuana possession while on probation• Total confinement upon probation revocation and sentencing requirements for total confinement• Probation review conferences• A new concept – administrative probation – for failure to pay restitution in full.House Resolution 634 was passed by the House Judiciary Committee in tandem with HB 1555. The resolution would create an interbranch Task Force on Technical Probation Violations to review current procedures and identify any inadequacies. The Senate probation reform bill – Senate Bill 14 – remains in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the JRI 2 initiatives was enacted as Act 114 of 2019, and it established the County Adult Probation and Parole Advisory Committee within the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD). The committee, members of which include the state court administrator and nine appointments by the chief justice, will assist in the development of a county adult probation funding plan and advise PCCD on all matters pertaining to the administration of the county adult probation and parole. The second JRI 2 proposal enacted was Act 115 of 2019. The act included comprehensive amendments to the Judicial (Title 42) and Prisons and Parole (Title 61) Codes, eliminating County Intermediate Punishment (CIP) and State Intermediate Punishment (SIP) as sentencing options, treating CIP as a part of county probation and creating a program similar to SIP called the State Drug Treatment Program. District elections for appellate courtsHouse Bill 196 is a proposed constitutional amendment providing for the election of the Supreme, Superior and Commonwealth Courts in seven, fifteen and nine districts, respectively. The districts would be established in law and “provide every resident of the commonwealth with approximately equal representation on a court,” be compact and contiguous, and contain nearly equal population as practicable. Also by law, the General Assembly would provide for the transition to district elections, the impact of the change upon eligibility to seek retention and the order in which the transition will occur. After seven months of inaction on the bill, the House passed HB 196 by a vote of 102-95 in December. If the Senate also passes this bill before the end of 2020, it would be the first of two required passages needed prior to a question being submitted to the electorate. Coming Up It is expected between now and the end of June the legislature will: • Pass the 2020-21 General Appropriations Act and required associated bills, such as the Fiscal and Administrative Codes, both of which will likely have judicial implications• Debate current proposals and amendments to the probation reform billsAdditionally, it is very possible the Senate will debate the appellate court district election proposal.

investigations. 

It is expected that legislation capturing provisions of both 
bills will be considered in the fall with the goal of sending 
something to the governor prior to the end of the legislative 
session. 

Police Reform 

Two policing reform bills were signed into law by the 
governor on July 14 – Acts 57 and 59. The latter includes 
provisions impacting the continuing education course 
for magisterial district judges. Specifically, it requires a 
course on the identification and reporting of child abuse, 
as that term is defined by the Domestic Relations Code. 
Other provisions in the bills, although not impacting

Remote notarial acts in response to COVID 19

On April 20, 2020, the governor signed Act 15 of 2020, 
which required the Department of State to authorize 
notaries public to conduct remote notarial acts in 
accordance with the act. The new section created in the 
act expires 60 days after the expiration of the COVID-19 
disaster emergency. House Bill 2370 would enact many of 
the same provisions as Act 15, but the enactments would 
remain after the disaster emergency expires. The bill is 
currently in the Senate Appropriations Committee.

10Recording devices traditionally have not been allowed in Pennsylvania courtrooms, with only very limited exceptions. But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last year established a much broader exception that empowers courts, in their discretion, to permit law enforcement and judicial security officers (e.g., Sheriff’s Offices) to activate their body cameras when necessary.By Supreme Court Order, Rule of Judicial Administration 1910 became effective on Jan. 1, 2020.Under the rule, courts may allow officers to activate their body cameras during a court proceeding in the event of an actual or imminent emergency situation. However, courts by local rule or court order may prohibit the practice.The new rule imposes several statewide restrictions and regulations. In addition to telling the presiding judge at the first reasonable opportunity that their camera has been activated, an officer must submit a written report to the judge within one business day explaining the circumstances that warranted it.The judge should then promptly share the report with district court administration.The rule expressly prohibits the sharing of recordings with anyone outside the court and law enforcement without the express written approval of the president judge.Body cameras in courtroomsCivil matters include every type of legal action except criminal actions - usually involving private disputes.(cid:31)(cid:30)(cid:29)(cid:28)(cid:27)(cid:26)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:30)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:17)(cid:23)(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:30)(cid:25)(cid:23)(cid:14)(cid:22)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:27)(cid:24)(cid:30)(cid:21)(cid:20)(cid:12)(cid:18)(cid:14)(cid:21)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:15)(cid:30)(cid:19)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:27)(cid:19)(cid:11)(cid:30)(cid:27)(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:30)(cid:19)(cid:18)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:13)(cid:17)(cid:10)(cid:30)(cid:17)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:11)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:15)(cid:30)(cid:27)(cid:17)(cid:13)(cid:25)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:22)(cid:9)How

out our new brochurehttp://www.pacourts.us/learnMore than 300 years ago, the Pennsylvania Constitution set up our state government in three separate branches:  executive, legislative and JUDICIAL.Think	of	Pennsylvania’s	judicial	branch	as	a	pyramid.		•	Seven	justices	serve	on	the	Court	and	their	job	is	to	make	the	final	judgment	in	interpreting	Pennsylvania’s	laws	and	Constitution.	•	The	Court	has	administrative authority over all aspects of Pennsylvania’s judicial

Pennsylvania has two intermediate appellate courts: Superior and Commonwealth. Both determine if errors were made in cases heard at the trial court level. •	These	courts	hear	criminal	and	civil	cases,	including	those	involving	families	and	children,	such	as	divorce,	property	division,	alimony,	child	custody	and	support,	paternity	and	protection	orders.	•	They	also	hear	appeals	from	the	lower-level courts.•	These	courts	are	where	most	people	have	experience	with	the	judicial	system.	•	Examples	of	cases	include:	traffic	tickets,	landlord-tenant	disputes	and	underage	drinking.1.12.23.34.45.5At the base are Magisterial District Courts and Philadelphia Municipal Court. The next level is the trial level,  called the Court of Common Pleas. The Superior Court is the appeals court for most citizens and businesses.  The Commonwealth Court  hears civil cases involving  state or local government. At the top of the pyramid is the Supreme Court, the highest court in the Commonwealth and the oldest appellate court in the nation.Additionally	at	this	level	are	problem-solving courts,	which	offer	rehabilitation	programs	for	defendants	struggling	with	behavioral	problems,	like	drug	addiction	and	severe		mental	illness.	A new brochure about understanding Pennsylvania Courts is now available! It is a companion piece to the Pennsylvania Justice: Understanding the Courts education video which was launched by AOPC in the fall. Both of these educational pieces describe in basic terms the role of the courts in a democracy, how the Pennsylvania court system is structured and how various types of cases advance through the system.Judges and other court staff are encouraged to use the video and the companion brochure at outreach events.Download a copy of the brochure on  our website at pacourts.us/learn or order copies by emailing CommunicationsOffice@pacourts.us.  The new brochure replaces an older version of the brochure (A Citizen’s Guide: The Judicial Branch).Watch the video on our website or on our PA Courts YouTube page.more INFORMATIONYouTube @PA Courts11BudgetThe governor proposed the 2020-21 budget on Feb. 4. With the exception of a slight increase in the Judicial Conduct Board line, the proposal maintains state funding for the judiciary at the same level as the current fiscal year. Probation Reform and Justice Reinvestment Initiative Two (JRI 2) Legislation advancing reforms to the probation system remains a topic of discussion in 2020. In late 2019, the House Judiciary Committee amended and advanced House Bill 1555. As amended, the bill addresses numerous issues including:• Medical marijuana possession while on probation• Total confinement upon probation revocation and sentencing requirements for total confinement• Probation review conferences• A new concept – administrative probation – for failure to pay restitution in full.House Resolution 634 was passed by the House Judiciary Committee in tandem with HB 1555. The resolution would create an interbranch Task Force on Technical Probation Violations to review current procedures and identify any inadequacies. The Senate probation reform bill – Senate Bill 14 – remains in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of the JRI 2 initiatives was enacted as Act 114 of 2019, and it established the County Adult Probation and Parole Advisory Committee within the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD). The committee, members of which include the state court administrator and nine appointments by the chief justice, will assist in the development of a county adult probation funding plan and advise PCCD on all matters pertaining to the administration of the county adult probation and parole. The second JRI 2 proposal enacted was Act 115 of 2019. The act included comprehensive amendments to the Judicial (Title 42) and Prisons and Parole (Title 61) Codes, eliminating County Intermediate Punishment (CIP) and State Intermediate Punishment (SIP) as sentencing options, treating CIP as a part of county probation and creating a program similar to SIP called the State Drug Treatment Program. District elections for appellate courtsHouse Bill 196 is a proposed constitutional amendment providing for the election of the Supreme, Superior and Commonwealth Courts in seven, fifteen and nine districts, respectively. The districts would be established in law and “provide every resident of the commonwealth with approximately equal representation on a court,” be compact and contiguous, and contain nearly equal population as practicable. Also by law, the General Assembly would provide for the transition to district elections, the impact of the change upon eligibility to seek retention and the order in which the transition will occur. After seven months of inaction on the bill, the House passed HB 196 by a vote of 102-95 in December. If the Senate also passes this bill before the end of 2020, it would be the first of two required passages needed prior to a question being submitted to the electorate. Coming Up It is expected between now and the end of June the legislature will: • Pass the 2020-21 General Appropriations Act and required associated bills, such as the Fiscal and Administrative Codes, both of which will likely have judicial implications• Debate current proposals and amendments to the probation reform billsAdditionally, it is very possible the Senate will debate the appellate court district election proposal. Legislative roundupby Damian J. Wachter, Esq.{Damian Wachter, Esq. is the assistant director of Legislative Affairs.}CLE Board develops diversity 
training program for lawyers 

likely to encourage the reporting of misconduct,” Levine 
commented. 

He explained that the Board conducted focus groups and 
purposefully tested the questions to ensure that they were 
able to produce a range of different answers. 

“The goal in all of this was to create 50/50 situations, 
meaning that we didn’t want to have 99 percent of the 
audience agreeing on an answer and moving on,” Levine 
explained. 

The purpose is really to stimulate conversation because it’s 
in that open nature of a dialogue where real perspectives 
are shared.” 

Overall, the program has been very well-received among 
the lawyers who have participated – many of whom enjoyed 
the opportunity for direct engagement through the audience 
polling.

In a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Entertainment and Technology Center, Pennsylvania’s 
Continuing Legal Education (CLE) Board has developed 
an interactive diversity training program for Pennsylvania 
lawyers. 

Cliff Levine, chair of the CLE Board, explained that this is a 
first-of-its-kind project for the Board. 

Over the course of a roughly two-year period, they worked 
with a group of six graduate students, along with content 
experts from around the state, to create an ethics program 
that is fun and engaging for the lawyers who take it. 

In the program, lawyers are shown short animated clips 
(created largely based on real-life situations) that address 
some of the pervasive issues and inherent challenges 
that many lawyers face concerning implicit bias, sexual 
harassment and inclusion in the workplace. 

The Board has made the program available free to 
accredited CLE course providers to offer to Pennsylvania 
lawyers for one to 1 1/2 hours of ethics credit. 

If you are a CLE course provider interested in obtaining 
this program, please contact PA CLE Board Associate 
Administrator Katey Buggy at 717-231-3212 or  
kbuggy@pacle.org.

Utilizing audience-polling technology, lawyers use their cell 
phones to anonymously vote on multiple-choice questions 
about the conduct depicted in the scenes they just watched.

then begins an in-depth discussion with the group. 

“It’s been interesting to see that many of the younger 
lawyers, and those detached from client relations, are more
