Supreme Court of Pennsylvania 
celebrates 300th Anniversary

A series of events held in 
Philadelphia on May 18 - May 
20 commemorated the 300th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court of 
Pennsylvania. 

The Judiciary Act of May 22, 1722 
permanently created the Supreme 
Court as the highest court of the 
Commonwealth, predating the 
United States Supreme Court by 
some seventy years and serving as a 
model for that later court.   

The Supreme Court conducted its 
May oral argument session on May 
18 in Philadelphia’s Old City Hall, 
where the Court held sessions in its 
early days. The historic session was 
livestreamed and available to the 
public.  

On May 19 and 20, a symposium 
was held at the National Constitution 
Center in Philadelphia, with speakers 
that included US Supreme Court 
Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, 
federal judges from the Third Circuit 
Court of Appeals, the Chief Justices 
of the Pennsylvania, Ohio, South 
Carolina and Rhode Island Supreme 
Court, other Pennsylvania Justices, 
law professors from ten different law 
schools, historians and lawyers. 

The symposium covered an arc 
beginning with the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court’s history and how the 
Court’s decisions are interwoven with 
the history of the Commonwealth, 
how state courts interact with 
one another and with the federal 
court system, the decision-making 
processes of state supreme 

2

courts, and the administration of 
Pennsylvania’s statewide judicial 
system and its impact on the lives of 
Pennsylvania citizens.  

The symposium sessions were again 
publicly available via livestream, 
and were also available to judges 
and lawyers for continuing education 
purposes.  

The preparation for the 300th 
anniversary also included updating 
a pamphlet history about the 
Supreme Court and the Pennsylvania 
judicial system, creating and posting 
biographical materials about current 
and former Supreme Court justices, 
and ongoing work to identify and 
preserve court artifacts for future 
generations. Materials be accessed 
on the Supreme300 webpage. 

Pa. Supreme Court Establishes New Judicial Ethics Advisory Board 

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recently announced 
the creation and membership of a new judicial ethics 
advisory board to ensure the continued integrity and 
public trust of the state’s judiciary. 

Established by a Court Order issued in January, the 
Judicial Ethics Advisory Board (JEAB) is charged with 
rendering advisory opinions concerning proper conduct 
under the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules 
Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District 
Judges.

Brian D. Jacisin as the Board’s 

The Court appointed Brian D. Jacisin
executive director, and later announced its membership. 
Prior to his appointment, Jacisin served for nearly 16 
years as legal counsel to the Pennsylvania State Ethics 
Commission – most recently as its chief counsel.  

The Board’s inaugural members will include: 

•  Hon. Victor P. Stabile

Victor P. Stabile, Judge of the Superior Court of 

Pennsylvania

•  Hon. Lori A. Dumas
of Pennsylvania

Lori A. Dumas, Judge of the Commonwealth Court 

•  Hon. Stephen P. B. Minor

Stephen P. B. Minor, President Judge of the Court 

of Common Pleas, Potter County

•  Hon. Edward D. Reibman

Edward D. Reibman, Senior Judge of the Court of 

Common Pleas, Lehigh County

•  Hon. Linda Rovder Fleming

Linda Rovder Fleming, Judge of the Court of 

Common Pleas, Cambria County

•  Hon. Patrick F. Dugan

Patrick F. Dugan, President Judge of the 

Philadelphia Municipal Court

•  Hon. David J. Barton

David J. Barton, Judge of the Allegheny County 

Magisterial District Court 

•  Hon. Jennifer J. Patton Clancy

Jennifer J. Patton Clancy, Judge of the York 

County Magisterial District Court

•  Jayne F. Duncan, Esquire, Lancaster County

“A single board, with broader representation, adequate 
staff, and well-trained members will provide not only 
prompt and reliable advice to judges and judicial 
candidates, but also an accessible database of advisory 
opinions and general guidance which can be referenced 
and followed moving forward,” said Pennsylvania 
Max Baer.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Max Baer

“The Court appreciates the valuable work performed 
by the judges who have served on the Special Court 
Judges Association of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania 
Conference of State Trial Judges Ethics Committees, and 
we are confident that the JEAB will build on that history to 
provide continued support for judges statewide.” 

The JEAB rules will provide for certain protections, known 
as the “rule of reliance,” where judges request and follow 
JEAB ethics advice. The Board will start rendering advice 
and guidance beginning July 1 when those provisions go 
into effect, replacing the current committees and rules of 
reliance.

AOPC Attends National Judicial College Workshop 

At the end of April, representatives from the Pennsylvania 
Courts and others attended the National Judicial 
College’s two-day workshop focused on course and 
faculty development. 

Hearing from experienced educators and industry 
leaders, the AOPC’s Judicial Education department, along 
with members of the Pennsylvania Conference of State 

Trial Judges Education Committee and the Minor Judiciary 
Education Board, participated in the training. 

Attendees left with some valuable takeaways and a 
more advanced understanding about adult learning 
theory, drafting learning objectives, designing courses 
and incorporating learning activities into educational 
programs for the Pennsylvania Judiciary. 

Classrooms vs. Courtrooms  
By Emma Cantor, AOPC Communications intern 

In May, Washington County 
Magisterial District Judge (MDJ) 
John Bruner
John Bruner presented his program, 
Classrooms vs. Courtrooms, to 
elementary and middle school 
students in McGuffey School 
District.  

The program has three goals: 1.) 
promote constitutional education, 
2.) increase knowledge about the 
judicial branch of government 
and 3.) encourage good student 
behavior. 

Specifically focused on these 
goals, MDJ Bruner aims to remind 
students about the importance 
of national holidays and learning 
about our country’s history 
by including lessons about 
recognitions such as Memorial and 
Independence Day. 

Moreover, he discusses vaping, 
truancy and impulse control in an 
effort to promote positive student 
behavior and prevent bad habits 
from forming at a young age.

“Educating a child about bad 

school behaviors in their classroom 

versus rendering a decision 

against them in our courtroom – 

that here is the focus. Students 

belong inside classrooms, not 

courtrooms. This education piece 

also promotes constitutional 

and civics education which is 

so important to their growth as 

American citizens,”  

MDJ Bruner explained.

New Court Administrator Class of 2022 

In May, new county court administrators 
across the state gathered at the 
Pennsylvania Judicial Center to learn 
about their responsibilities and benefit 
from each other’s knowledge and 
experience.

While specific tasks and circumstances 
vary for each judicial district, the 
primary responsibilities begin at the 
core of court administration with 
caseflow and workflow management.

Led by seasoned court administrators 
and AOPC staff, presentations 
on leadership, human resource 
management and relationship building 
with key stakeholders (i.e., president 
judges, county executives, court staff 
etc.) were well received.

The training also provided guidance 
on issues surrounding court security, 

right-to-know/public access, language 
access and other essential components 

of court operations and personnel 
management. 

Cat comes to court

In May, Delaware County court staff spotted a cat hanging 
around the building, a little too close to the street. They brought 
her in, and ran to the store to get food, litter and a toy for her. 

Meanwhile, a constable with some excellent investigation skills 
went looking for her humans, and a while after having lunch, a lot 
Lee Grimes’ 
of playtime with her new toy, and a nice nap in Judge Lee Grimes’ 
arms, she was picked up by her humans who said her name was 
Sky. 

Thank you to all the court staff and the constable who made 
Sky’s field trip to the court a huge success!

2nd Annual Lebanon 
County Veterans Court 
softball tournament

To complete the community service project that is required of all 
Lebanon County Veterans Court participants to graduate from the 
program, one participant organized a softball tournament involving 
veterans courts in neighboring counties (Berks, Dauphin, Lancaster 
and York). While Lebanon County met Lancaster County in the 
championship last summer, Lancaster County walked away the victor. 
The tournament was such a success that it is now an annual event 
where families and friends are welcome to attend.

The Research team collects data from various court divisions 
in the judicial districts and AOPC’s own automated case 
management systems to publish monthly and annual reports.

Each year, the Annual Caseload Statistics of the Unified Judicial 
System (UJS) are published as the official measure of state court 
operations. These figures are provided to legislators, the media, 
academic study initiatives, national data repositories and the 
public on the Pa. Courts website and its interactive dashboards.  

In the interim, timely caseflow data by counties are updated 
monthly online via the Caseload Highlights Report. 

Another significant role of the department is to coordinate 
and conduct studies that help inform policy and practice 
improvements to the administration of justice.  

In addition to original research, the Research team also conducts 
statewide surveys, provides data collection and analysis, and 
builds infographics such as charts, graphs, maps and interactive 
dashboards to supplement the work of various work groups and 
committees.

Achieving Procedural Justice 
in the Virtual World 

By Rick Pierce, AOPC Judicial Programs administrator 

Every court user has two “needs” that come with 
expectations of our courts. The first need is what Mark 
Moore, Harvard University professor and author of the 
book “Recognizing Public Value” calls the human need – 
or how one desires to be greeted and treated while doing 
business with the court.  

Moore calls the second need the “business need,” or 
addressing why they came to court. Each need comes 
with expectations the court user has of the court and its 
employees. Every day courts grapple with meeting both 
needs of every court user in a satisfactory manner. This 
process is called procedural fairness or procedural justice. 

is not able to have physical access to the court facility. 
Virtual hearings provide opportunities for access to justice 
for all. The convenience of participating somewhere 
besides the confines of a courtroom meant the court may 
conduct its business anywhere.

Still, courts must continue to address barriers to access to 
justice such as the court’s acceptance and comprehension 
that the virtual courtroom may be a litigant’s living room, 
or kitchen with other household members who may or 
may not be a distraction to the party. Danielle and Zach 
shared personal experiences of jurists they interviewed 
who have presided over such hearings. 

Every litigant or court user expects to be treated with 
dignity and respect, have an opportunity to tell their 
side of the story, have their case be treated equitably 
and fairly among all other cases and be resolved in an 
expeditious and timely manner. Lastly the court customer 
desires a comprehension of the process and application 
of the law the court used in rendering its decision. 

Each jurist noted the court must have patience and 
understanding. Most of all, the court should express 
empathy toward the court participant, especially when 
the challenge to participate remotely may be greater than 
in person. Empathy requires perspective taking. Taking 
the challenged court user’s perspective enables access 
and creates more inclusivity into our justice system. 

The AOPC/Judicial District Operations department offered 
a sixty-minute virtual training session led by the National 
Center for State Courts (NCSC) on this topic of procedural 
fairness. Principal Management Consultants Danielle 
Hirsch and Zach Zarnow of NCSC provided insight to over 
60 jurists and court administrators on procedural justice. 
Hirsch and Zarnow paid particular attention to remote 
court proceedings. 

The COVID-19 public health crisis and resultant physical 
separation and isolation made it paramount for the courts 
to find a means of continuous operations when the public 

The webinar was recorded and can be watched here:

Managing your distress in the aftermath of a shooting

The attack on students and teachers at Robb Elementary 
School was a horrifying event for the community of 
Uvalde, Texas and a painful reminder of past tragedies 
for communities across the United States that have 
experienced school shootings.

As authorities investigate, now is the time to focus 
on accepting the concerns mass shootings create, 
understanding what you can do to protect yourself and 
your loved ones from harm, and helping younger family 
members address the emotional stress that might develop 
when they feel unsure and unsafe away from home.

Pa Courts 
Promote Elder 
Abuse Awareness

This month, the Pennsylvania Courts, 
including the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court Advisory Council on Elder Justice 
in the Courts, recognized World Elder 
Abuse Awareness Day by highlighting the 
importance of identifying and understanding 
elder abuse for one of Pa.’s most vulnerable 
populations. 

“Paying attention to the warning 
signs of neglect, physical, emotional 
and sexual abuse, as well as financial 
exploitation is absolutely critical in 
protecting seniors and vulnerable 
adults. We know that for each case 
of elder abuse that gets reported to 
authorities, there are often dozens 
more that never come to light,” said 
Pa. Supreme Court Justice Debra 
Todd. “Elder abuse can happen to 
you, your neighbor or your loved ones 
– but we can help protect seniors by 
remaining vigilant and learning the 
warning signs.” 

Part of the awareness and education efforts 
extended to the county level as well. On 
June 17, Montgomery County held its 7th 
Annual Elder Justice Conference – the theme 
of which was ‘Exploring Alternatives to 
Guardianship’. 

Statewide leader in guardianship reform and 
longtime chair of the Roundtable Keynote, 
Administrative Orphan’s Court Judge Lois 
Lois 
Murphy
Murphy, was not only instrumental in the 
planning the conference, but also served as

Jefferson County Courthouse Active Shooter Drill

It started out as a calm, peaceful Friday 
morning in downtown Brookville. Finally, 
a break in the rain with sunny skies. 
Main Street was coming alive for the day 
and preparations were underway for 
the annual Laurel Festival. But all that 
changed at 8:53 a.m. when two actors 
entered the Jefferson County Courthouse 
shooting anyone in their way.

WAIT! This was only an exercise! However, 
this scenario is all too common in our 
country.

Smoke grenades were lit, and explosives 
and gunfire could be heard throughout the 
building. Employees and citizens started 
to evacuate and by-standers on the 
street offered any assistance they could 
give. What felt like an eternity ended 3 
minutes later when law enforcement took 
one shooter into custody and wounded 
the second shooter. Several people were 
critically hurt. 

In an effort to keep employees, elected 
officials and visitors safe, Jefferson County 
organized and conducted this drill. After 
months of training, it was time to put some 
of this to the test in a full-scale exercise 
that was facilitated by the Jefferson 
County Department of Emergency 
Services. 

The Sheriff’s Office and Probation Officers 
were first on the scene, followed by 
Brookville Police Department. Jefferson 
County EMS and Brookville Volunteer Fire 
Company were also summoned to the 
scene. While the exercise was designed to 
strengthen the security measures for the county, the other 
participating agencies added to the realistic approach 
that was needed to make this seem as real as possible. 

Tracy W. Zents, director of Emergency Services who acted 
as the facilitator of the exercise stated, “This was the time 
to make mistakes. Correct them and be ready in a real 
situation.” 

According to Zents, the scenario was only known to a 
couple of individuals. 

“We wanted the training of the sheriff’s office and 
probation department to dictate their course of actions 
without knowing the shooter’s motive or intended target,” 
added Zents.

Most active shooter events happen for only a few minutes 
are generally unpredictable and evolve quickly. But the 
residual effects can last much longer. 

14

Typically, the immediate deployment of law enforcement 
is required to stop the attack and mitigate harm to 
victims. Individuals must be prepared both mentally and 
physically to deal with a situation like this. 

Chad Weaver
Chad Weaver, court administrator for Jefferson County 
said he was impressed on how well everything worked. 
“I’m very appreciative of the entire emergency services 
and law enforcement’s efforts to collaborate so quickly for 
this unfortunate, but necessary exercise.” 

In terms of next steps, the team will review all of the notes, 
photographs, videos and evaluations to prepare an after-
action report highlighting best practices and areas that 
need improvement. 

District judge 
launches 22nd 
annual ‘Drugs 
Kill Dreams’ 
campaign aimed 
at Armstrong 
County children

By Tony LaRussa

Pittsburgh Tribune Review.

J. Gary 
When Ford City District Judge J. Gary 
DeComo
DeComo launched a youth anti-drug 
campaign in 2000, he knew that 
helping kids make choices that lead 
them away from drug abuse would 
take more than a catchy slogan, 
a pep talk and handing out sports 
memorabilia. But it was a start.

“Those things are just my way of 
getting their attention and raising the 
level of drug prevention awareness,” 
said DeComo, who is kicking off his 
22nd annual “Drugs Kill Dreams” 
initiative. “I’m not a prevention 
specialist, I’m a prevention advocate. 
I want to give the kids and the adults 
around them something to think 
about. Something to help them 
remember.”

When it began in 2000, the 
campaign was named after a poster 
made by a fourth grader at Lenape 
Elementary School. Today, DeComo 
said, reinforcing the anti-drug 
message is more important than ever 
because of the opioid crisis. 

“Back in 2007, we were noticing that 
we were chasing kids for possession 
of a small amount of marijuana, but 
there wasn’t much attention being 
paid to the dangerous narcotics 
they could find right in the medicine 
cabinet,” DeComo said. “It took quite 
a while for the federal government to 
realize how big the opioid problem 
really was. And now we’re dealing 
with the consequences.”

Ford City District Judge J. Gary DeComo poses in front of a collection of sports 
memorabilia he has assembled to hand out to kids and youth organizations who sign a 
pledge to make choices that will help avoid drug abuse. The effort is part of his 22nd 
annual “Drugs Kill Dreams” campaign.

Between 2015 and 2017, Armstrong 
County experienced a drug-
related death rate spike that was 
significantly higher than the state 
and national averages, according 
to an “OverdoseFreePA” study 
conducted by the University of 
Pittsburgh.

The study showed that in 2015, the 
overdose death rate in Armstrong 
County was 40.5 per 100,000 
residents — compared to 27.1 for the 
state and 16.5 nationally.

In 2016, the county number rose to 
62 per 100,000 residents, while the 
rates were 36.7 at the state level 
and 19.9 nationally. In 2017, the rate 
in the county was 59.4 per 100,000 
residents, compared with rates of 44 
across the state and 21.8 nationally.

The study found that fentanyl, heroin 
and anti-anxiety benzodiazepines 
were involved in 80% of accidental 
drug overdoses during that same 
time.

15

While the campaign officially 
started in 2000, DeComo began 
visiting local schoolchildren in 1994 
to discuss the dangers of drugs. 
He takes his anti-drug campaign 
directly to children by visiting classes 
at schools throughout Armstrong 
County. The presentations include 
a request that students sign an anti-
drug pledge.

Rewards are given in the form of 
sports memorabilia that the judge 
has assembled. Larger memorabilia 
items often are donated to local 
youth sports groups that sign the 
pledge so they can raffle them off to 
raise money.

“I’m always looking for small sports 
items like 8-by-10 photos of players 
the kids might enjoy having, and I 
try to get them autographed,” the 
magistrate said. “I have no interest in 
collecting sports memorabilia myself. 
But I know the kids like it, and it’s a 
great way to open the door to the 
important message I want to convey 
to them.”

Commonwealth Court Reflects on Passing  
of Retired Judge Johnny J. Butler

Following the recent passing of retired Judge Johnny J. Butler, 
Commonwealth Court President Judge Renée Cohn Jubelirer 
the following statement on behalf of the Court:

Renée Cohn Jubelirer released 

“We are deeply saddened about the passing of our former colleague, 
Judge Johnny J. Butler
Johnny J. Butler. Judge Butler was a wonderful man who will 
be remembered for his intellect, fortitude and commitment to public 
service. Our sincerest condolences go out to Judge Butler’s family, 
friends and colleagues as they grieve this difficult loss.”

Judge Butler served on the Commonwealth Court from 2008 until 
2011. Prior to joining the Court, he was appointed Secretary of Labor 
and Industry in 1995 by then Governor Tom Ridge, where he served 
until 2003.

A dedicated public servant, he held several roles at the U.S. Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) including Associate 
Regional Attorney (1975-79), Philadelphia District Director (1979-95) 
and Acting General Counsel (1984-87).

Judge Butler also served as an adjunct professor at Howard and 
Temple Universities, on the Board of Directors for the Philadelphia 
African-American Museum, and as an assistant counsel at the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund in the beginning of his career.

BLUEPRINT FOR RACIAL 
JUSTICE OFFERS GUIDANCE, 
RESOURCES FOR COURTS

Reprinted with permission from the National Center for 
State Courts newsletter – @ the Center. 

Courts across the country are taking steps to gain a better understanding of race as leaders work to identify and 
address inequities impacting racial justice.

Through the Blueprint for Racial Justice, NCSC is bringing courts together to problem solve and share best practices and 
lessons learned to develop an array of resources that can help courts start or continue their racial justice journey.

Guided by a steering committee of chief justices, state court administrators, and NCSC leadership, more than 150 judicial 
branch leaders, court executives, and NCSC experts are developing tools to improve racial equality to ensure all court 
users, litigants, and community members are heard and respected by the justice system. A 2020 resolution from the 
Conference of Chief Justices and Conference of State Court Administrators charged leaders to examine systemic change 
in the system.

Last month, the group released “Systemic Change Guiding Principles” that outline seven principles to assist courts 
with examining the root causes of disparities and seeking reforms at the system level. These principles can be used 
to evaluate potential areas to address, propose policy reforms, or conduct analyses on proposed rule changes or 
legislation.

And earlier this month, State Court Organization published judicial demographic information on gender, race, and 
ethnicity.

Additionally, the project is creating opportunities for conversations about racial justice through webinars and a Watch, 
Read, Listen project that introduces literary works such as, “So You Want to Talk About Race,” to evoke thoughts, feelings 
and ideas about race.

Since last year, the Blueprint for Racial Justice has hosted nine webinars with topics ranging from guidance on creating 
your own racial justice blueprint and initiating courageous conversations about race to systemic issues related to pretrial 
release and financial sanctions. Today, a new five-part series focusing on juries begins at 1 p.m. ET.

Resources developed through the Blueprint for Racial Justice are available in NCSC’s online Racial Justice Resource 
Center. Ongoing and future work includes a racial justice organizational assessment toolkit for courts, resources on 
topics such as data collection strategies and judicial mentorship and an internship portal. Financial support from NCSC 
and the State Justice Institute has made this work possible.

To learn more about the Blueprint for Racial Justice, contact Edwin Bell, Director of Racial Justice, Equity and Inclusion, 
or project director Jennifer Elek.
