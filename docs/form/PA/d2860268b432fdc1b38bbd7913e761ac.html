      <pre>Received 08/24/2021 Supreme Court Eastern District

Filed 08/24/2021 Supreme Court Eastern District

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
 
Docket No. 21 EM 2020 
 

In Re: Philadelphia Municipal Court’s Request Pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 
1952(B)(2)(m) and (s) for an Emergency Order Authorizing the 
President Judge of the Philadelphia Municipal Court to Suspend 
the Operation of Pa.Rs.Crim.P. 600 and 1013 and any rule 
restricting the Use of Advanced Communication Technology 

 

Patrick F. Dugan, President Judge of the Philadelphia Municipal Court, hereby requests 
the Supreme Court to enter an emergency order authorizing the President Judge of the 
Philadelphia Municipal Court to suspend the operation of Pa.Rules.Crim.P. 600 and 1013 
and any rule restricting the Use of Advanced Communication Technology, and represents 
as follows: 

.  The First Judicial District took extraordinary steps, from the onset of the pandemic, to 

ensure that criminal proceedings were held as safely and timely as possible. Municipal 
Court maintained ongoing contact and interaction with its justice partners which 
include the Defender Association, the District Attorney’s Office, the private Bar, the 
Sheriff’s Office, the Philadelphia Police Department, the City of Philadelphia’s 
Managing Director’s Office and the Department of Public Property (as well as its 
building management subcontractor) and the Philadelphia Department of Prisons.  
Safety concerns related to COVID-19 required modifications to court procedures and 
case scheduling, with increased video hearings and, eventually, a limited number of in-
person proceedings scheduled hourly throughout the day.  

  
2.  With closures effectuated in March 2020, Municipal Court pivoted from in-person 
proceedings to conducting as many proceedings as possible through the use of 
Advanced Communication Technology (ACT). This required the FJD and stakeholders 
to create and acclimate to a new way of scheduling and holding hearings in a 
pandemic.  Throughout the pandemic, Municipal Court’s criminal division NEVER 
closed. 

 

  1

 

  From the onset of the pandemic, preliminary arraignment court continued to 

operate 24/7.  While arrests initially slowed, there was a steady increase to criminal 
filings, particularly for violent crimes.  From March 20, 2020 through July 2021, 
Municipal Court conducted over 34,000 preliminary arraignments for new felony 
and misdemeanor cases.    
 

  The FJD used ACT to conduct emergent motion hearings remotely for 

approximately 1,000 custody inmates. Commencing March 20, 2020, the presiding 
judge and court staff were present in the courtroom, with defendants confined in 
the Philadelphia Prison System and attorneys participating remotely from various 
locations.     

  Early Bail Review, Crash Court and Bench Warrant Court remained operational 
since emergency closures were implemented in March 2020.  From January 
through August 23, 2021, ACT allowed the court to process over 6,000 hearings 
with the presiding judge and court staff present in the courtroom from the onset of 
the pandemic. As an alternative to conducting in-person proceedings, the 
continued use of ACT is necessary for the referenced court lists with defendants 
confined in local custody.  This measure allows Municipal Court to continue limiting 
the number of people in the courtroom, thereby preventing the spread of COVID-
19.  Presiding judges and court staff will continue to be present in the courtroom, 
and attorneys may opt to participant via video.  Time schedules have been secured 
with the Philadelphia Department of Prisons for incarcerated defendant 
participation.     
 

  On August 31, 2020, Municipal Court reopened for in-person hearings starting with 
homicides and non-fatal shooting preliminary hearings. By September 8, 2020, 7 of 
our 13 courtrooms were operating in-person, and by November 2020,16 
courtrooms were safely reopened in the Stout Center for Criminal Justice, along 
with a new courtroom in the Philadelphia Department of Prison’s Detention Center 
(March 2021). Courtrooms proceedings were a mix of in-person only and ACT 
proceedings. Status listings in courtrooms commenced in May 2020.  Additional 
rooms opened with a focus on the adjudication of pretrial, felony custody matters. 
From August through December 2020, we scheduled approximately 4,400 felony 
preliminary hearings. Municipal Court scheduled an additional 32,805 felony 
preliminary hearings January through August 2021. 
 
In the last half of 2020, 21,750 cases were scheduled for status via ACT including 
bail  motions.  While  increasing  the  number  of  cases  scheduled  before  judges,  in 
compliance with CDC guidelines for public health safety measures, we organized off 
site  locations  for  the  remote  testimony  of  police  and  civilian  witnesses  to  further 
decrease the number of people coming into the main courthouse building.  

 

3.  Recognizing the First Judicial District’s March 17, 2020 declaration of Judicial 

Emergency, the resulting suspension of time calculations for the purposes of time 
computations relevant to court cases and time deadlines, and the subsequent orders 
extending same, the Supreme Court approved, by order dated July 2, 2021, the First 
Judicial District’s request “to continue suspending Rules of Criminal Procedure 600 
and 1013, as well as any procedural rules related to the use of advanced 
communication technology (ACT) in court proceedings, through August 31, 2021.1 

.  Since that Order was entered, the surge in COVID-19 cases has increased 

substantially, and there has been an increase in exposure to the highly contagious 
Covid-19 variants. The 7-day case averaged 47 new cases per day on July 2, 2021 
and increased to a 7-day average of 281 new cases per day as of August 19, 2021, a 
600% increase in just over a month. The CDC has classified Philadelphia County as a 
"high" to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Philadelphia County has the second

lowest vaccination rate per 100,000 residents of any County in the Commonwealth. In 
the past month, The City of Philadelphia reinstated the indoor mask mandate. The 
First Judicial District implemented the same policy, mandating mask wearing 
regardless of vaccination status at all court facilities. Court leadership receives daily 
and weekly updates on the number of employees who test positive for COVID-19. 
Although there were weeks of zero, there has recently been a clear uptick in the 
number of employee cases. There is no indication that the present rate of increase in 
cases will abate in the near term. 

.  In light of the recent substantial and high rates of community transmission levels as 

noted above, the Philadelphia Municipal Court requests the Court to further extend the 
suspension of Rules of Criminal Procedure 600 and 1013, as well as any procedural 
rules related to the use of advanced communication technology (ACT) in order to 
dispose of its current inventory and new cases. 

.  Although Municipal Court judges assigned to criminal matters are working from the 
Courthouse, and most proceedings are currently being conducted in-person, we 
continue to maintain the option to conduct preliminary hearings and other Municipal 
Court hearings and trials remotely. The Philadelphia Department of Prisons is 
experiencing overcrowding conditions which have now been exacerbated by 
increasing COVID-19 cases and the accompanying need to quarantine prisoners who 
have tested positive or are suspected positive cases. Currently, approximately 385 of 
the department's prisoner population are quarantined as positive or suspected COVID-
19 cases. All quarantined inmates are unavailable for court.  

.  Due to the above circumstances, both transporting defendants in custody for in-person 
proceedings and conducting trials and other in-person proceedings present a potential 
threat to prison and court staff, witnesses, parties, and counsel by exposing all such 
individuals to multiple prolonged enclosed contacts with defendants who may have 
been exposed to COVID-19 and others who are not members of the same household. 
In March 2021, with the use of ACT, Municipal Court opened a Courtroom at the 
Detention Center to alleviate the Sheriff’s transportation limitations at the Stout Center. 
To date, we have scheduled over 1400 custody felony preliminary hearings to the 
Detention Center Courtroom. 

.  Because in-person court proceedings for any COVID-19 positive or suspected positive 
defendant cannot be held and must be continued, placing further strain on the court's 
efficiency and its ability to timely dispose of the increased inventory as provided in 
Pa.R.Crim.P. 600 and 1013, the Court’s authorization to suspend the application of 
Rules 600 and 1013 will continue to assist the Philadelphia Municipal Court to manage 
criminal matters in a manner that both maximized the safety of all participants and 
moved cases toward trial as soon as practicable without undue concern that the 
timeframes set forth by said rule would be compromised. 

herefore, the current increase in exposure to Covid-19 and its variants requires the 
continuation of remote hearings and suspension of the rules as noted above and the

PER CURIAM 

AND  NOW,  this  2nd  day  of  July,  2021,  the  Request  Pursuant  to  Pa.R.J.A. 

1952(B)(2)(m) is  GRANTED.  With respect to  President  Judge Idee  C.  Fox’s  request  to 

suspend, through August 31, 2021, Rule of Criminal Procedure 1013, we observe that on 

March 17, 2020, President Judge Fox issued Administrative Order No. 10 of 2020, which 

declared that  “[t]ime calculations for the purposes of time computation relevant to court 

cases or other  judicial business, as well as time deadlines, are  suspended pursuant to 

Pennsylvania  Rule  of  Judicial  Administration  1952(B).”  Administrative  Order  No.  10, 

3/17/2020  at  ¶1.  Based  on  this  authority,  and  the  subsequent  orders  extending  it,  we 

grant the President Judge’s request to continue suspending Rules of Criminal Procedure 

600  and  1013,  as  well  as  any  procedural  rules  related  to  the  use  of  advanced 

communication technology (ACT) in court proceedings, through August 31, 2021.  Judges 

shall  be  present  in  the  courthouse,  judicial  center,  or  other  court  facility  whenever  a 

proceeding is being conducted by ACT, except for extraordinary circumstances, such as 

when  court  properties have been  closed  due to  inclement  weather or  other emergency 

under  Pa.R.J.A.  Nos.  1950-1954,  or  when  a  proceeding  is  not  being  conducted  during 

normal business hours.
