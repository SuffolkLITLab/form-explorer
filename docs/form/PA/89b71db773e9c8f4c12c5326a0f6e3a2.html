0003774-2014  (“Case  No.  3774”),  Appellant  robbed  an  individual  named 

David  Engle  at  gunpoint  with  the  assistance  of  two  co-conspirators  at  the 

corner of 47th Street and Kingsessing Avenue.  At CP-51-CR-0008432-2014 

(“Case  No.  8432”),  Appellant  committed  a  similar  “stick-up”  robbery  of  a 

husband and wife,  Dongjie Ji and Ran Liu, at  the corner of  45th Street and 

Spruce  Street  with  the  help  of  one  co-conspirator.    These  two  incidents 

occurred within approximately one week of each other in March 2014. 

Ultimately, Appellant was arrested and charged with similar offenses at 

both docket numbers, including robbery, criminal conspiracy, and possession 

of an instrument of crime (“PIC”).  These cases were consolidated for a jury 

trial, which was held from February 10 through February 12, 2016.  At Case 

No. 3774, Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery.  At Case 

No.  8432,  Appellant  was  convicted  of  two  counts  of  robbery  and  one  count 

each of criminal conspiracy and PIC.  Appellant was sentenced to an aggregate 

term of twenty to forty years of incarceration at all counts.1   

Appellant  filed  a  consolidated  direct  appeal  in  both  cases.    This  Court 

affirmed his judgments of sentence and our Supreme Court denied Appellant’s 

subsequent  request  for  allowance  of  appeal  on  September  4,  2019.    See 

Commonwealth  v.  Smith,  216  A.3d  433  (Pa.Super.  2019)  (unpublished 

____________________________________________ 

1  Specifically, Appellant received concurrent terms of ten to twenty years of 
imprisonment for each robbery count and a concurrent term of ten to twenty 
years  of  imprisonment  for  conspiracy  at  Case  No.  8432.    No  further 
punishment was imposed.  At Case No. 3774, Appellant was sentenced to a 
term of ten to twenty years of imprisonment with as to his robbery conviction.  
The sentences at each case were set to run consecutively to one another.

memorandum at 1-7), appeal denied, 217 A.3d 799 (Pa. 2019).  Appellant did 

not  seek  review  in  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  and  his  time  to  do  so 

expired on December 3, 2019.  See U.S. Sup. Ct. Rule 13(1). 

On June 13, 2020, Appellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition listing 

both  above-captioned  cases.    PCRA  counsel  was  duly  appointed  and  an 

amended petition was filed on Appellant’s behalf raising a claim of ineffective 

assistance  of  trial  counsel  for  failing  to  call  an  alibi  witness  named  David 

Tingle, who was one of Appellant’s co-conspirators in the robbery at Case No. 

8432 and had provided information to police that inculpated Appellant in that 

crime.  See Amended PCRA Petition, 2/5/21, at 1-7 (unpaginated); Smith, 

supra  at  1-2.    Thereafter,  Appellant  submitted  a  supplemental  filing 

identifying  a  second  such  alibi  witness  named  Monique  Johnson,  who  is 

Appellant’s  mother.2 

  See  Supplemental  Motion,  3/19/21,  at  4-5 

(unpaginated).    Appellant  also  filed  a  certification  pursuant  to  Pa.R.Crim.P. 

902(A)(15)  providing  contact  information  and  a  basic  description  of  the 

testimony offered by each witness.  Id. at 5.  Overall, Appellant averred Mr. 

____________________________________________ 

2  Appellant did not seek explicit approval prior to submitting his March 19, 
2021  supplemental  PCRA  filing.    Generally,  this  is  not  permitted.    See 
Commonwealth  v.  Baumhammers,  92  A.3d  708,  730  (Pa.  2014) 
(“[P]etitioners  may  not  automatically  ‘amend’  their  PCRA  petitions  via 
responsive pleadings.”).  Nonetheless, the PCRA court in this matter permitted 
the filing and, thereafter, considered the substance of the allegations set forth 
in  the  supplemental  PCRA  submission.    Accordingly,  the  PCRA  court 
“effectively  allowed  Appellant  to  amend  his  petition  to  include  those  issues 
presented in the supplement.”  Commonwealth v. Boyd, 835 A.2d 812, 816 
(Pa.Super. 2003).  Thus, any relevant pleadings set forth in the supplemental 
PCRA petition were properly raised in both the PCRA court and this Court. 

- 3 - 

J-A26041-22 

Tingle  and  Mrs.  Johnson  were  available  and  willing  to  testify  that  Appellant 

was with them at the time of these crimes, and that counsel was aware of, or 

should have discovered, their existence.  See Amended PCRA Petition, 2/5/21, 

at 2-5; Supplemental Motion, 3/19/21, at 4-5. 

On June 24, 2021, the PCRA court filed  notice of  its intent to  dismiss 

Appellant’s petition without a hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907(1) for lack 

of  merit,  which  garnered  no  response.    On  July  21,  2021,  the  PCRA  court 

dismissed Appellant’s petition at both cases.  Appellant filed a timely notice of 

appeal listing only the docket number in Case No. 8432.  See Notice of Appeal, 

8/12/21, at 1.  Thereafter, the PCRA court directed Appellant to file a concise 

statement of errors pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).  He timely complied and 

the PCRA court filed a responsive Rule 1925(a) opinion. 

Despite only filing a notice of appeal listing Case No. 8432, this Court 

concluded that Appellant had manifested a clear intent to appeal the denial of 

his PCRA petition at both cases.  See Commonwealth v. Smith, 1649 EDA 

2021  (Pa.Super.  Nov.  29,  2022)  (non-precedential  decision  at  5).  

Accordingly, we remanded to provide Appellant with an opportunity to correct 

this procedural error pursuant to Commonwealth v. Young, 265 A.3d 462, 

477-78 (Pa. 2021) (“[W]here a timely appeal is erroneously filed at only one 

docket, [Pa.R.A.P. 902] permits the appellate court, in its discretion, to allow 

correction of the error, where appropriate.”).  On remand, Appellant filed a 

corrected notice of appeal and the PCRA court forwarded the record in Case 

No. 3774.  Thus, this matter is now ripe for adjudication on the merits.

Before  this  Court,  Appellant  asserts  that  the  PCRA  court  erred  by 

dismissing his PCRA petition without a hearing despite his allegations that his 

trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to call two 

alibi  witnesses  to  testify  in  his  defense.    See  Appellant’s  brief  at  2.    The 

standard and scope of our review in this context is practically axiomatic: 
 

When reviewing the denial of a PCRA petition, an appellate court 
must determine whether the PCRA court's order is supported by 
the record and free of legal error.  Generally, a reviewing court is 
bound  by  a  PCRA  court's  credibility  determinations  and  its  fact-
finding, so long as those conclusions are supported by the record.  
However,  with  regard  to  a  court's  legal  conclusions,  appellate 
courts apply a de novo standard. 

ommonwealth v. Drummond, 285 A.3d 625, 633 (Pa. 2022) (cleaned up).   

Appellant’s  arguments  pertain  to  allegations  of  the  ineffectiveness  of 

trial counsel, our review of which are also well-defined in Pennsylvania law: 

To  prove  that  counsel  was  ineffective,  the  petitioner  must 
demonstrate:  (1) that the underlying claim has arguable merit; 
(2) that no reasonable basis existed for counsel's actions or failure 
to act; and (3) that the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of 
counsel's  error.  .  .  .    Counsel  is  presumed  to  be  effective; 
accordingly, to succeed on a claim of ineffectiveness the petitioner 
must adduce sufficient evidence to overcome this presumption. 

d.at  634.    More  specifically,  Appellant’s  claim  concerns  counsel’s  alleged 

failure  to  present  alibi  witnesses  on  his  behalf.    Accordingly,  he  must 

demonstrate that:  (1) the witness existed; (2) the witness was available to 

testify  for  the  defense;  (3)  counsel  knew  or,  or  should  have  known  of,  the 

existence of the witness; (4) the witness was willing to testify for the defense; 

and (5) the absence of the testimony of the witness was so prejudicial as to

have denied the defendant a fair trial.  See Commonwealth v. Sneed, 45 

A.3d 1096, 1109 (Pa. 2012).   

Finally,  Appellant’s  argument  challenges  the  PCRA  court’s  decision  to 

deny his ineffectiveness claim without  a hearing.  Pursuant to  Pennsylvania 

Rule of Criminal Procedure 908(A)(2), courts are required to hold a hearing 

where  a  PCRA  petition  raises  “material  issues  of  fact.”    Pa.R.Crim.P. 

908(A)(2).  By contrast, Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 909(B)(2) 

permits  the  dismissal  of  PCRA  petitions  without  a  hearing  if  the  court  is 

satisfied that “there are no genuine issues concerning any material fact, the 

defendant is not entitled to post-conviction collateral relief, and no legitimate 

purpose  would  be  served  by  any  further  proceedings.”    Pa.R.Crim.P. 

909(B)(2).  In order “to obtain reversal of a PCRA court’s decision to dismiss 

a petition without a hearing, [a petitioner] must show that he raised a genuine 

issue of material fact which, if resolved in his favor, would have entitled him 

to  relief,  or  that  the  court  otherwise  abused  its  discretion  in  denying  a 

hearing.”  Commonwealth v. Hanible, 30 A.3d 426, 452 (Pa. 2011).   

 

The PCRA court has related that its decision to deny Appellant’s petition 

without a hearing was the result of its conclusion that the two alibi witnesses 

proffered  by  Appellant  lacked  any  credibility.    See  Trial  Court  Opinion, 

1/12/22,  at  8-14.    Specifically,  the  PCRA  court  accurately  asserts  that  Mr. 

Tingle  “is  the  very  same  person  who  incriminated  [Appellant]  in  the 

robberies.”  Id. at 9.  With respect to Mrs. Johnson, the PCRA court similarly 

- 6 - 

J-A26041-22 

suggests that her familial relationship with Appellant essentially precludes her 

from offering alibi testimony in this case.3  Id. at 14.  Based upon this alleged 

lack of credibility, the PCRA court concludes that Appellant will be unable to 

satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness test under Pennsylvania law 

since the Commonwealth’s evidence at trial was “overwhelming” with respect 

to guilt.  See id. at 13-14.  We must disagree. 

 

Both Mr. Tingle and Mrs. Johnson certainly have a personal relationship 

with  Appellant  that  may  serve  to  undercut  or  complicate  the  value  of  their 

testimony.    However,  we  emphasize  that  no  such  testimony  has  yet  been 

offered in this case.  Rather, the PCRA court has based its credibility findings 

entirely  upon  its  own  assumptions  concerning  the  witnesses’  character.  

However, a witness’s “demeanor and temperament” while testifying in court 

is a factor that we expect the trier of fact to consider when addressing that 

witness’s  credibility.    Commonwealth  v.  Thompson,  93  A.3d  478,  492 

(Pa.Super. 2014).  The PCRA court has effectively subverted this expectation 

by rendering premature judgments concerning the credibility of Mr. Tingle and 

Mrs. Johnson.  In the same way that it is improper for an appellate court to 

____________________________________________ 

3  Specifically, the PCRA court has cited an unpublished memorandum of this 
Court that was filed prior to May 1, 2019, in support of its interpretation of 
Pennsylvania law.  Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, 
this  holding  may  not  be  cited  for  its  persuasive  value.    See  Pa.R.A.P. 
126(b)(1)-(2).  Generally, such cases may not be cited by any court or party.  
See Superior Court I.O.P. § 65.37(B) (“An unpublished memorandum decision 
filed prior to May 2, 2019, shall not be relied upon or cited by a Court or a 
party in any other action or proceeding[.]”). 

- 7 - 

J-A26041-22 

render credibility determinations “relying solely upon a cold record,” we find 

that it is equally improper for a PCRA court to do the same here.  See, e.g., 

Commonwealth v. Farquharson, 354 A.2d 545, 550 (Pa. 1976) (noting that 

there is “legitimacy” in the credibility determinations of a trial court only to 

the extent that it has an opportunity to directly observe witnesses). 

 

We also find the following passage to be instructive: 

Many factors may affect the probative value of testimony, such as 
age  [,]  . . . intelligence,  experience,  occupation,  demeanor,  or 
temperament of the witness.  A trial court or jury before whom 
witnesses appear is at least in a position to take note of such 
factors.    An  appellate  court  has  no  way  of  doing  so.    It  cannot 
know whether a witness answered some questions forthrightly but 
evaded others.  It may find an answer convincing and truthful in 
written form that may have sounded unreliable at the time it was 
given.  A well[-]phrased sentence in the record may have seemed 
rehearsed  at  trial.    A  clumsy  sentence  in  the  record  may  not 
convey the ring of truth that attended it when the witness groped 
his way to its articulation. 
 

Id. at 491 n.3 (emphasis added).  Thus, while an appellate court is bound to 

rely upon “the mute record made below,” we concomitantly depend upon the 

trier  of  fact  to  render  a  fully  informed  decision  regarding  the  credibility  of 

witnesses.  Id.  No such adjudication took place in this case since the PCRA 

court failed to adduce an adequate basis to entirely malign the credibility of 

Mr. Tingle and Mrs. Johnson.  We find  that  the credibility  determinations of 

the PCRA court are not supported by the record and, consequently, we are not 

bound by them in this matter.  See, e.g., Drummond, supra at 633.   

Due to the PCRA court’s decision to issue its ruling without holding an 

evidentiary  hearing, we may only speculate as to the potential character of 

- 8 - 

J-A26041-22 

these witnesses on the stand or the content of their putative averments.  The 

specific  circumstances  of  Appellant’s  allegations  of  ineffectiveness  remain 

woefully  underdeveloped  without  such  testimony  and,  consequently, 

Appellant’s entitlement to relief, or lack thereof, is not clear from the available 

record.  However, we note that Appellant’s PCRA petitions aver the basic facts 

necessary  to  make  out  a  claim  of  ineffectiveness  for  failure  to  call  an  alibi 

witness.    Compare  Amended  PCRA  Petition,  2/5/21,  at  2-5;  Supplemental 

Motion, 3/19/21, at 4-5 with Sneed, supra at 1109. 

We recognize that “[i]t is within the PCRA court’s discretion to decline 

to  hold  a  hearing  if  the  petitioner’s  claim  is  patently  frivolous  and  has  no 

support  either  in  the  record  or  other  evidence.”    Commonwealth  v. 

Williams,  244  A.3d  1281,  1287  (Pa.Super.  2021)  (cleaned  up).    While 

Appellant’s  claims  may  not  ultimately  prove  to  be  meritorious,  we  cannot 

conclude  his  arguments  are  entirely  specious  without  the  benefit  of  fact-

finding.    Thus,  his  averments  and  the  undisputed  existence  of  these  alibi 

witnesses creates a material issue of fact that requires resolution at a PCRA 

hearing with testimony.  See Commonwealth v. Hart, 199 A.3d 475, 482 

(Pa.Super.  2018)  (vacating  order  denying  PCRA  relief  and  remanding  for  a 

hearing to address an unresolved material issue of fact). 

Based  on  the  foregoing,  we  conclude  that  the  PCRA  court  abused  its 

discretion in denying Appellant an evidentiary hearing based upon credibility 

determinations that were not supported by the record.  Thus, we vacate the 

- 9 - 

order denying Appellant’s PCRA petition and remand for further proceedings 

consistent with this memorandum. 

Order vacated.  Case remanded.  Jurisdiction relinquished.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
