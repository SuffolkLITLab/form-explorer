Supreme Court of Pennsylvania 

Code of Conduct For Employees of the Unified Judicial System 

. 

INTRODUCTION 

A  fair  and  independent  court  system  is  essential  to  the  administration  of  justice.    Proper 
conduct  by  employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  of  Pennsylvania  (UJS)  inspires  public 
confidence  and  trust  in  the  courts,  and  conveys  the  values  of  impartiality  and  fairness  that 
promote the integrity of the work of the Unified Judicial System.   

n  employee  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  observe  high  standards  of  conduct  so  that 
the  integrity  and  independence  of  the  judiciary  are  preserved  and  the  employee’s  conduct 
reflects  a  commitment  to  serving  the  public.   The  provisions  of this  Code  shall  be  applied  to 
further these objectives. 

mployees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  observe  the  following  standards  of  conduct. 
However,  the  standards  of  this  Code  shall  not  affect  or  preclude  other  more  stringent 
standards required by law, by court order or rule, or other workplace policies. 

I. 

SCOPE 

For the purposes of this Code, the term “Employees of the Unified Judicial System” includes 1) 
all  state-level  court  employees,  2)  all  county-level  court  employees  who  are  under  the 
supervision and authority of the President Judge of a Judicial District of Pennsylvania, unless 
otherwise  indicated  by  Supreme  Court  order  or  rule  and,  3)  all  employees  of  boards 
established by Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, including, but not limited to, the 
following  -  Continuing  Legal  Education  Board,  Disciplinary  Board  of  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Pennsylvania,  Interest  on  Lawyers  Trust  Account  Board,  Pennsylvania  Lawyers  Fund  for 
Client Security Board and Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners.   

ote: Judges and magisterial district judges are covered by the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Rules 
Governing  Standards  of  Conduct  of  Magisterial  District  Judges,  respectively,  and  therefore  are  not 
included in the scope of this Code.  

II. 

CONFIDENTIALITY 

Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  safeguard  confidential  information 
acquired  in  the  course  of  their  employment.    Employees  shall  not  disclose  or  use 
confidential  information  for  any  purpose  not  connected  with  the  performance  of  their 
official duties.  

For  the  purpose  of  this  section,  “confidential  information”  is  that  required  to  be  kept 
confidential  pursuant  to  federal  law,  state  law,  court  rule,  court  order,  administrative 
regulation,  policy  or  directive.    Confidential  information  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to: 
data,  source  code,  notes,  papers,  memoranda,  discussions,  deliberations,  proprietary 
information and electronic communications, such as e-mail or facsimile.

Acceptance  of  Gifts  and/or  Use  of  Position  for  Personal  Gain.   Employees  of  the 
Unified  Judicial  System  shall  not  solicit,  accept  or  agree  to  accept  anything  of  value 
from any person or entity doing or seeking to do business with, or having an interest in a 
matter before, the court or court-related entity by which they are employed, subject to 
the following exceptions:   

i. 

acceptance  of  a  gift  from  a  family  member  when  the  circumstances  make  it 
clear that the purpose is personal; 

Note:  "Family member" is defined as spouse, child, brother, sister, parent, grandparent, 
grandchild, 
father-in-law,  mother-in-law,  sister-in-law,  brother-in-law,  son-in-law, 
daughter-in-law,  stepfather,  stepmother,  stepson,  stepdaughter,  uncle,  aunt,  niece, 
nephew and first cousin.  

acceptance of meals or refreshments of nominal value in the ordinary course of 
a meeting, conference or other official business; 

acceptance  of  loans  from  banks  or  other  financial  institutions  on  similar  terms 
offered to the public for purposes such as a home mortgage; 

acceptance  of  gifts  of  nominal  value  for  special  occasions  such  as  marriage, 
illness or retirement; 

acceptance  of  a  plaque  or  other  item  offered  as  a  token  of  appreciation  for  a 
public appearance; 

acceptance  of  educational  materials  directly  related  to  the  employee’s  duties; 
and 

acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material of nominal value, 
such  as  pens,  pencils,  note  pads,  calendars  and  items of  apparel  with  vendor 
logo. 

ote:  Employees must exercise diligence in observing high standards of conduct that 
promote  the  integrity  and  impartiality  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System.    If  it  might 
reasonably  be  inferred  that  the  donor’s  primary  purpose  in  providing  the  unsolicited 
advertising  or  promotional  material  is  to  influence  an  employee  in  the  performance  of 
official duties, acceptance of the unsolicited material should be declined.

seeking to do business with, or having an interest in a matter before, the court or court-
related entity by which they are employed to their designated supervisor.   

Acceptance  of  Additional  Compensation.    Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial 
System shall not solicit or accept any additional compensation or anything of value from 
any other source for performing the duties and responsibilities of their position.

confidential.  Upon termination from employment, employees may, with the permission 
of their supervisor, take with them copies of written material in which they participated 
as a part of a personal file, but shall not release such writings to any other party without 
the written consent of the court or other court-related entity that the employee served.

Employees  shall  not  accept  honoraria  or  fees  given  for  speaking  in  their  official 
capacity, but may be reimbursed for related travel expenses.  Employees may accept 
such fees for  speaking engagements for  appearances  unrelated to  their employment 
and made on their own time. 
 
Special  Treatment  and/or  Special  Favors.    Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial 
System  shall  not  permit  family,  social,  or  other  relationships  to  influence  their  official 
conduct or judgment, or to create the appearance of influencing their official conduct.  
Employees  shall  inform  their  supervisor  of  any  situation  creating  undue  influence  or 
the appearance of undue influence. 

Employment  Practices.    Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  make  all 
hiring,  employment,  and  supervisory  decisions  in  compliance  with  the  Unified  Judicial 
System  of  Pennsylvania  Policy  on  Non-Discrimination  and  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity,  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration,  and  all  applicable  state  and  federal 
laws.    Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  avoid  favoritism,  or  the 
appearance of favoritism, when making hiring, employment, and supervisory decisions 
and shall make such decisions impartially and on the basis of merit. 

Note:  Reflecting  the  values  of  impartiality  and  fairness  that  promote  the  integrity  of 
Pennsylvania’s  courts,  it  is  the  policy  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  to  recruit  and  employ  the 
most qualified job applicants through an open and competitive hiring process which allows for a 
full,  complete,  and  unbiased  assessment  of  each  applicant’s  relative  knowledge,  experience, 
skills, and abilities.   

Misuse  of  Employment  Position,  Equipment,  or  Supplies.    Employees  of  the 
Unified  Judicial  System  shall  not  use  the  resources,  employees,  property,  facilities, 
equipment, time, or  funds  under their  control to  improperly  benefit  themselves  or  any 
other person. 

Personal  and  Financial  Interests.    Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall 
not  participate  in  any  court-  or  work-related  matter  wherein  they  have  more  than  a 
minimal personal or financial interest.   

Duty  to  Disclose.    If  a  conflict  of  interest  should  arise,  the  employee  shall 
immediately advise his or her supervisor.  If the supervisor determines that a conflict 
of  interest  exists,  then  the  employee  shall  abide  by  any  employment  restrictions that 
are deemed to be necessary.   

Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  not  engage  in  political  activity  that  is 
inconsistent  with  the  independence,  integrity,  or  impartiality  of  the  Judiciary.    The  Supreme 
Court of Pennsylvania has defined prohibited and permitted activities as follows: 

Running  for  or  Being  Appointed  to  Publicly  Elected  Office.    Employees  of  the 
Unified  Judicial  System  shall  not  become  candidates,  or  campaign  for,  any  publicly 
elected  office.    In  the  event  an  employee  chooses  to  become  a  candidate  for,  or  is 
appointed to, a publicly elected office, he or she must resign from his or her position at 
the close of business on the earliest date on which the employee:

ote: In accordance with Sections VI.A. and VI.E., job applicants also may be required to resign 
from  certain  non-elected  positions  effective  as  of  the  day  before  their  first  day  of  judiciary 
employment  if  continuing  in  the  position  would  detract  from  the  impartiality  of  the  judiciary  or

Office.    Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  not  engage  in  the  following

the AOPC is responsible for providing guidance to these individuals, or their designees, 
regarding the political activity policies in this section.

activities  that  do  not  detract  from  the  impartiality  of  the  judiciary  or  interfere  with  the 
performance of their official duties or the functioning of the workplace.  Employees may 
serve  as  officers,  directors,  trustees,  or  non-legal  advisors  of  educational,  religious, 
charitable,  fraternal,  social  or  civic  organizations,  and  may  solicit  funds  for  any  such 
organization, subject to the limitation that the name and prestige of the court shall not

Code of Conduct for Employees of the Unified Judicial System 

 6 

Employees of the Unified Judicial System may write, lecture, teach, and speak on legal 
or non-legal subjects provided that such activities do not detract from the impartiality of 
the judiciary and/or interfere with the performance of their official duties. 

Employees of the Unified Judicial System shall not state personal opinions, except to 
other  UJS  employees,  regarding  any  legal  or  administrative  matter  that  is  pending 
before  any  UJS  court  or  entity  when  the  personal  opinion  of  the  employee  may 
reasonably  be  construed  as  representing  the  official  position  of  the  employee  or  the 
official position of a UJS court, jurist, entity or another employee. 

Note: Rule 2.10 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in part, as follows:  Rule 2.10.  Judicial 
Statements  on  Pending  and  Impending  Cases.    (A)  A  judge  shall  not  make  any  public 
statement that might reasonably be expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of a 
matter  pending  or  impending  in  any  court,  or  make  any  nonpublic  statement  that  might 
substantially interfere with a fair trial or hearing.  (B)  A judge shall not, in connection with cases, 
controversies,  or  issues  that  are  likely  to  come  before  the  court,  make  pledges,  promises,  or 
commitments  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  impartial  performance  of  the  adjudicative  duties  of 
judicial office.  (C)  A judge shall require court staff, court officials, and others subject to 
the judge’s direction and control to refrain from making statements that the judge would 
be  prohibited  from  making  by  paragraphs  (A)  and  (B).    See  also  Rule  2.10  of  the  Rules 
Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges. 
 
Employees of the Unified Judicial System shall not require, request or accept the offer 
of any subordinate to perform tasks of a personal nature. 

 

Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  shall  not  engage  in  financial  or  business 
dealings or in any other personal activities that may detract from the impartiality of the 
judiciary,  may  otherwise  interfere  with  the  performance  of  their  official  duties,  or  may 
exploit the employee’s official position. 

Employees  of  the  Unified  Judicial  System  may  engage  in  outside  employment  or 
commercial  activity  that  does  not  interfere  or  conflict  with  their  official  duties.  Outside 
employment  or  commercial  activities  must  be  reported  in  writing  in  advance  to  the 
employee’s  supervisor.  Business  transactions  that  are  strictly  personal,  minor  or 
incidental need not be reported. 

Before engaging in any outside employment that involves the practice of law, the legal 
system or the administration of justice, the employee shall first consult with his or her 
supervisor to determine whether the proposed position is consistent with the standards 
in this Code. 

This  requirement  does  not  extend  to  official  representation  of  the  UJS  and  its 
constituent  parts,  judicial  officers  and  employees  in  any  state  or  federal  court  or 
tribunal.    Nor  does  this  requirement  extend  to  the  limited  representation  of  the 
employee’s relatives or self, but such limited representation is subject to prior approval 
by the employee’s supervisor and to the disclosure of UJS employment to the parties 
and the court in which the employee enters an appearance or represents him/herself in 
a matter.  

Note: The Supreme Court has adopted several specific policies respecting the practice of law, 
other than on behalf of the UJS:  (1) Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 3121 prohibits 
the practice of law by appellate court staff except in limited circumstances.  (2) Pursuant to the 
Supreme Court’s Per Curiam Order dated December 11, 2014 (effective September 11, 2015), 
law clerks employed in the Unified Judicial System are prohibited from appearing as counsel in 
the division/section of the court in which they are employed or in which the judge by whom they 
are employed serves.  Further, in courts which have no formally established divisions or

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
