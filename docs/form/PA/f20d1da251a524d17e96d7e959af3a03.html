ATHANIEL NYIEM HILL       

 

Appellant 

 No. 648 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered April 12, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-41-CR-0001758-2019 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., BENDER, P.J.E., and NICHOLS, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY NICHOLS, J.: 

FILED MARCH 20, 2023 

 

Appellant Nathaniel Nyiem Hill appeals from the judgment of sentence 

imposed  following  his  convictions  for  possession  with  intent  to  distribute  a 

controlled substance (PWID) and related offenses.  Appellant argues that the 

Commonwealth  did  not  present  sufficient  evidence  identifying  him  as  the 

perpetrator of the offenses.  Following our review, we affirm. 

 

The trial court summarized the facts of this case as follows: 

On July 16, 2019, Trooper Andrew Corl of the Pennsylvania State 
Police  was  working  with  the  [confidential  informant  (CI)],  as  he 
had  done  twice  before,  to  arrange  a  purchase  of  heroin.    The 
following day, July 17, 2019, Trooper Corl instructed the CI, who 
goes by the name “Amy” when purchasing drugs, to reach out to 
her dealer who she stated she knew as  [“Naj”1].  At 2:06 p.m., 

____________________________________________ 

1 Throughout its opinion, the trial court states that “Naz” was the individual 
who sold the drugs to the CI.  However, the record reflects that the CI knew 
that individual as “Naj.”  See N.T. Trial, 9/13/21, at 18, 85.  For purposes of 
consistency, we have amended the  quotations from the trial court’s opinion 
accordingly.

the  CI  texted  a  [phone]  number  she  used  to  arrange  for  the 
purchase of drugs, which had a 272 area code, and asked for a 
“honey bun,” which is a bundle of heroin.  The CI received a text 
back  instructing  her  to  call  the  number,  which  she  did,  and  at 
which  point  a  meeting  location  for  the  sale  of  the  drugs  was 
determined.  

Thereafter, Trooper Corl took the CI to Rural Avenue between Fifth 
and  Fourth  Streets  [in  Williamsport].    Trooper  Corl  parked  his 
unmarked car along Fifth Street and Louisa Street, such that Rural 
Avenue was to the north and 4th Street was to the east.  Trooper 
Corl provided the CI with $70.00 of pre-recorded money and the 
CI  texted  the  272  number  that  she  had  arrived  at  2:43  p.m.  
Between approximately 2:51 p.m. and 2:54 p.m., the CI texted 
[Naj] to inquire when he would be at the meeting location because 
it was “about to pour again.”  

At some point thereafter, Trooper Corl observed two black males 
walk past his vehicle and then walked east on an unnamed alley 
between  Rural  Avenue  and  Louisa  Street.    Both  males  were 
wearing black button down shirts and one of them had on a white 
undershirt and a ball cap.  Trooper Corl later determined that the 
male wearing the white undershirt was [Appellant] based on his 
own  comparison  of  [Appellant’s]  license  and  JNET  photographs.  
The next thing Trooper Corl saw was the CI walking back toward 
him  at  which  time  she  gave  him  ten  (10)  small  blue  bags 
containing a white powder, later determined to be a combination 
of heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.  Trooper Corl did not see the buy 
occur,  but  when  the  CI  was  briefed,  [the  CI]  told  him  that  she 
dealt  with  the  male  with  the  white  undershirt,  known  to  her  as 
[Naj].  

Detective  Tyson  Havens  of  the  Lycoming  County  Narcotics 
Enforcement Unit testified that he witnessed the same two males 
that  walked  by  Trooper  Corl’s  vehicle  walking  south  on  Fourth 
Street at which time he was able to obtain video surveillance of 
them  as  well  as  still  shots.    Detective  Havens  testified  that  he 
“knew [Appellant’s] face from prior contact but that there were no 
tattoos on [Naj]’s neck as of July 17, 2019.[”] 

The CI testified that on July 17, 2019, she texted the 272 number, 
which she used frequently to purchase heroin and that in the past, 
she has dealt with many people using that same number.  When 
she was directed to call the person with whom she was texting, 
she knew she was speaking with [Naj] because she recognized his 

- 2 - 

J-S39036-22 

voice.  [Naj] said he would send someone to sell her the drugs, 
but  that  he  ended  up  coming  himself  with  another  individual 
unknown to the CI.  When [Naj] arrived, he was wearing a white 
undershirt and was taller than the other individual.  After the three 
of them had turned down the alley, the CI gave the $70 to [Naj] 
and [Naj] is the one who handed her the drugs.  

The CI testified that she knew the person in the white undershirt 
to be [Naj] because she has bought drugs from him for two years 
on  and  off  and  because  of  the  gap  in  his  teeth.    At  the  time  of 
trial, the CI identified [Appellant] as the person she knows to be 
[Naj]  and  the  person  who  sold  her  the  drugs  on  July  17,  2019.  
The CI later admits, though, that at the time of trial, [Appellant’s] 
teeth “did not look as gapped out” as they did at the time of the 
buy.  The CI admitted that she was using drugs as of July 2019 
but even so, she was able to interact with others and know with 
whom she was speaking.  

At  the  time  of  trial,  the  Commonwealth  introduced  two  (2) 
surveillance  videos.    On  the  first  video,  the  CI  is  seen  walking 
north on Fifth Street with two black males, their backs facing the 
camera.    The  males  are  both  wearing  black  button  down  shirts 
with black pants.  One of them has a hat on, and is taller than the 
other.    Eventually,  the  three  make  a  right  hand  turn  onto  the 
unnamed alley running parallel between Rural Avenue and Louisa 
Street,  leaving  the  camera’s  line  of  sight.    No  transaction  is 
captured on video.  

The  second  video,  taken  by  Detective  Havens,  shows  the  same 
two males walking south on Fourth Street without the CI, toward 
the  camera.    It  is  clear  in  the  video  that  the  male  wearing  the 
white undershirt and hat has a large circular tattoo on the under 
part of his left forearm, closer to his elbow than to his wrist.  

The JNET photographs taken of [Appellant] on July 2, 2019 as well 
as  [Appellant’s]  driver’s  license  photograph,  compared  with  the 
still shots of the video taken by Detective Havens, shows that the 
male in the white undershirt is [Appellant].  Additionally, the JNET 
photographs  clearly  show  a  large,  round  tattoo  on  the  left 
underside of [Appellant’s] forearm.  However, it does not appear 
that [Appellant] had a tattoo on his neck as of July 2, 2019.

On  December  5,  2019,  the  Commonwealth  charged  Appellant  with 

PWID,  delivery  of  a  controlled  substance,  criminal  use  of  a  communication 

facility,  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  and  possession  of  drug 

paraphernalia.2  Ultimately,  following a  bench trial on September  13, 2021, 

the trial court found Appellant guilty of all charges.  Appellant subsequently 

filed a post-trial motion challenging the weight of the evidence, which the trial 

court denied.  See Trial Ct. Op. & Order, 1/28/22. 

On March 25, 2022, the trial court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate 

term of four to nine years’ incarceration.  The trial court issued an amended 

sentencing  order  on  April  12,  2022,  which  added  a  term  of  twelve  months’ 

reentry  supervision,  consecutive  to  the  previously  imposed  sentence.    Am. 

Sentencing Order, 4/12/22.  Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal3 and a 

2 35 P.S. §§ 780-113(a)(30), (a)(30), 18 Pa.C.S. § 7512(a), 35 P.S. §§ 780-
113(a)(16), (a)(32). 

 Appellant erroneously stated that the appeal was from the September 13, 
2021 verdict and the March 25, 2022 judgment of sentence.   See Notice of 
Appeal, 4/21/22; see also Commonwealth v. O’Neill, 578 A.2d 1334, 1335 
(Pa. Super. 1990) (stating that “in criminal cases appeals lie from judgment 
of sentence rather than from the verdict of guilt”).   In cases where the trial 
court  amends  the  judgment  of  sentence  during  the  period  it  maintains 
jurisdiction  pursuant  to  42  Pa.C.S.  §  5505,  the  direct  appeal  lies  from  the 
amended judgment of sentence.  See Commonwealth v. Garzone, 993 A.2d 
1245, 1254 n.6 (Pa. Super. 2010).  Therefore, the appeal is properly from the 
April  12,  2022  amended  judgment  of  sentence,  and  we  have  amended  the 
caption accordingly.

court-ordered  Pa.R.A.P.  1925(b)  statement.4    The  trial  court  issued  a  Rule 

1925(a) opinion adopting the analysis set forth in its January 28, 2022 opinion 

and order denying Appellant’s post-trial motion.  See Trial Ct. Op., 6/3/22, at 

On appeal, Appellant raises the following issue for review: 

Whether there existed sufficient evidence to find [Appellant] guilty 
of  [PWID],  delivery  of  a  controlled  substance,  criminal  use  of  a 
communication facility, possession of a controlled substance and 
possession of drug paraphernalia.  

4  Here,  Appellant’s  Rule  1925(b)  statement  does  not  identify  the  elements 
Appellant  claims  the  Commonwealth  failed  to  prove  at  trial.    See  Pa.R.A.P. 
1925(b) Statement, 5/5/22, at 1.  It is well settled that a vague challenge to 
the sufficiency of the evidence may result in waiver.   See Commonwealth 
v. Roche, 153 A.3d 1063, 1072 (Pa. Super. 2017).  Instantly, the trial court 
addressed Appellant’s sufficiency claims, and the case against Appellant was 
relatively  straightforward.    Therefore,  we  decline  to  find  waiver.    See 
Commonwealth v. Laboy, 936 A.2d 1058, 1060 (Pa. 2007) (per curiam).   

  We  note  that  in  his  argument  section,  Appellant  also  challenges  the 
credibility of the Commonwealth’s witnesses.  However, such claims go to the 
weight, not the sufficiency, of the evidence.  See Commonwealth v. Wilson, 
825 A.2d 710, 713-14 (Pa. Super. 2003) (explaining that  our review of the 
sufficiency of evidence does not include an assessment of credibility, which is 
more properly characterized as a challenge to weight of evidence).  Further, 
Appellant  included  a  weight-of-the-evidence  claim  in  his  Rule  1925(b) 
statement, but he did not include that issue in his statement of questions on 
appeal,  nor  did  he  develop  a  proper  weight  claim  in  his  brief.    Accordingly, 
Appellant’s weight claim is waived.  See Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 151 
A.3d 1117, 1122, n.12 (Pa. Super.  2016); see also Pa.R.A.P. 2116(a).   

n  any  event,  were  we  to  reach  Appellant’s  challenge  to  the  weight  of  the 
evidence, we would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in

J-S39036-22 

Appellant  argues  that  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to  identify  him  as 

the individual who sold the drugs to the CI.  Id. at 8-9.  In support, Appellant 

asserts that “[t]here was no witness presented that was able to testify that 

they witnessed the controlled drug transaction.”  Id. at 8.  Further, Appellant 

notes that although the police were recording the CI while he was outside of 

the police vehicle, there was no footage of the controlled buy.  Id.  Appellant 

also claims that, at the time of his arrest, he did not have “any buy money” 

in  his  possession,  nor  did  he  have  the  cellular  phone  used  to  set  up  the 

purchase.    Id.    Finally,  Appellant  argues  that  there  “was  no  evidence 

presented connecting [Appellant] to the number associated with the cellular 

phone that was contacted to set up the buy.”  Id. 

When reviewing a sufficiency claim, our standard of review is as follows: 

Because  a  determination  of  evidentiary  sufficiency  presents  a 
question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope 
of review is plenary.  In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, 
we must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial and all 
reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in the light most 
favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, were sufficient 
to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The  facts  and  circumstances  established  by  the  Commonwealth 
need not preclude every possibility of innocence.  It is within the 
province of the fact-finder to determine the weight to be accorded 
to each witness’s testimony and to believe all, part, or none of the 
evidence.  The Commonwealth may sustain its burden of proving 
every  element  of  the  crime  by  means  of  wholly  circumstantial 
evidence.  Moreover, as an appellate court, we may not re-weigh

denying Appellant’s motion for new trial and would affirm on the basis of the 
trial court’s opinion.  See Trial Ct. Op. & Order at 5-8.

the  evidence  and  substitute  our  judgment  for  that  of  the 
factfinder. 

Commonwealth  v.  Palmer,  192  A.3d  85,  89  (Pa.  Super.  2018)  (citation 

omitted and formatting altered). 

This Court has held that, “[i]n addition to proving the statutory elements 

of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt, the Commonwealth must 

also establish the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes.” 

Commonwealth v. Smyser, 195 A.3d 912, 915 (Pa. Super. 2018) (citation 

omitted).  Further, “[i]t is settled that a positive identification by one witness 

is sufficient for conviction.”  Commonwealth v. Johnson, 180 A.3d 474, 478 

(Pa. Super. 2018) (citation omitted). 

Appellant’s  claim  relates  solely  to  the  sufficiency  of  the  identification 

evidence.  Accordingly, we will limit our review to whether the Commonwealth 

established  the  identification  element.    See  Commonwealth  v.  Cain,  906 

A.2d  1242,  1244  (Pa.  Super.  2006)  (declining  to  address  the  sufficiency  of 

evidence as to every element of a crime where an appellant only challenges 

identification evidence). 

[E]vidence  of  identification  need  not  be  positive  and  certain  to 
sustain  a  conviction.    Although  common  items  of  clothing  and 
general physical characteristics are usually insufficient to support 
a conviction, such evidence can be used as other circumstances 
to  establish  the  identity  of  a  perpetrator.    Out-of-court 
identifications  are  relevant  to  our  review  of  sufficiency  of  the 
evidence  claims,  particularly  when  they  are  given  without 
hesitation  shortly  after  the  crime  while  memories  were  fresh. 
Given  additional  evidentiary  circumstances,  any  indefiniteness 
and uncertainty in the identification testimony goes to its weight.

Commonwealth  v.  Orr,  38  A.3d  868,  874  (Pa.  Super.  2011)  (en  banc) 

(citations omitted and formatting altered); see also Johnson, 180 A.3d at 

478.  “[T]he Commonwealth may establish the essential elements of the crime 

wholly by circumstantial evidence.”  Commonwealth v. Ratsamy, 934 A.2d 

1233, 1237 (Pa. 2007) (citation omitted).    

Instantly,  the  trial  court  addressed  the  evidence  presented  at  trial  as 

follows: 

[Appellant]  [] asserts that  there is no evidence of the buy itself 
and  that  the  only  photographs  are  of  himself  in  the  area  where 
the buy occurred and around the same time of the buy.  

With  this  []  assertion,  [Appellant]  purports  to  admit  that  the 
photographs introduced as Commonwealth’s Exhibits 12 and 13 in 
fact  depict  him.    Either  way,  .  .  .  the  male  depicted  in  the 
photographs  wearing  the  white  undershirt  is  clearly  [Appellant] 
when  compared  with  his  JNET  and  driver’s  license  photographs 
and because of his forearm tattoo.  Additionally, the CI specifically 
testified  that  the  person  who  handed  the  drugs  to  her  was  the 
man  in  the  white  undershirt  and  that  the  man  the  in  the  white 
undershirt was [Appellant]. . . . 

It is important to note that the CI also testified to the following 
specific facts: that she recognized [Appellant’s] voice when they 
spoke on the phone to arrange the drug buy; that she recognized 
him when he showed up to sell her the drugs, even though she 
was expecting someone else; that it was [Appellant] who handed 
her the drugs; and that [Appellant] tried to give her significantly 
more drugs than what she had originally wanted.  

The  CI’s  testimony,  when  corroborated  with  the  other  evidence 
and testimony presented at trial, the [c]ourt was convinced, and 
remains  convinced  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  [Appellant] 
committed the crimes with which he was charged.  The CI did not 
have  drugs  on  her  person  before  she  left  Trooper  Corl’s  vehicle 
but had them when she came back from her meeting with the two 
males.  [Appellant] and his companion arrived at the exact same 
location  as  was  pre-arranged  between  the  CI  and  [Naj].    The 
timeline  of  text  messages  and  phone  calls  between  the  CI  and 

- 8 - 

J-S39036-22 

[Naj]  line  up  with  when  [Naj]  and  his  companion  arrived.  
Although there is no surveillance of the drug transaction itself, this 
is not necessary for the Commonwealth to prove its case.  Taking 
into consideration all of the evidence presented, the [c]ourt finds 
that the Commonwealth has proven its case beyond a reasonable 
doubt. 

Trial Ct. Op. & Order at 6-8. 

 

Based on the totality of the circumstances and our review of the record, 

in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as 

verdict  winner,  we  conclude  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence  to  establish 

Appellant’s identity as the perpetrator.  See Palmer, 192 A.3d at 89.   

As noted by the trial court, the Commonwealth presented two witnesses 

who identified Appellant as the perpetrator at trial.  Specifically, the CI made 

an  in-court  identification  of  Appellant  and  noted  that  she  knew  him  as  Naj. 

See N.T. Trial,  9/13/21, at 85.  The CI also stated  that she had purchased 

drugs from Appellant on multiple occasions, that Appellant was the individual 

who sold her the drugs during the controlled buy, and that Appellant had been 

wearing a white undershirt at the time of the transaction.  Id.  at 88.  Trooper 

Corl also testified that Appellant had been wearing a white undershirt when 

Appellant arrived at the agreed-upon time and location for the controlled buy.  

See  id.  at  37.    Trooper  Corl  further  stated  that  he  observed  the  drug 

transaction via video, and that after the CI returned to the police vehicle with 

the drugs, the CI reported that she had purchased the drugs from the man in 

the  white  undershirt,  who  she  knew  as  Naj.    Id.  at  39,  43.    Finally,  the 

Commonwealth  introduced  photographs  and  video  that  depicted  Appellant 

- 9 -

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
