are based purely on law and facts, rather than favoritism,

taught in the Airborne Infantry is guiding me in leading

“The Army has enriched my life. The first big thing the Army 
teaches you is about doing things for more than just yourself. 
You think of others. There’s no place for ego. Leadership comes 
from that. You have the back of your fellow soldiers and they 
have yours. As a judge, you continue to work as a team with 
the staff, the parties, attorneys and witnesses to achieve 
justice. It is a wonderful thing if it works right and just like the 
Army, justice is not about me being the judge, it is about being 
a member of a team. A judge is like a high-ranking officer and 
that judge has to guide people through a challenge. It is about 
ensuring a fair process and a fair result.”

he moved with confidence and took life in stride. The training I 
received as a Marine helped me to realize that the human body 
is made to do so much more than we think and that groups 
of hard-charging Americans infused with esprit de corps, 
and God’s blessing, can conquer any enemy. Civilian world

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
