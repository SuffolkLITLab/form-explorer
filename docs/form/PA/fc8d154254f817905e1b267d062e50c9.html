Appeal from the Order Entered October 21, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County Domestic Relations at 
No(s):  FC-2021-90711 

EFORE:  BENDER, P.J.E., LAZARUS, J., and McLAUGHLIN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY McLAUGHLIN, J.: 

 

 FILED: MARCH 20, 2023 

Michael T. Brown (“Father”) appeals from the order awarding him shared 

physical and legal custody of his minor child, A.O.B. (“Child”). Father argues 

the court erred in relinquishing jurisdiction. We affirm. 

Father  filed  the  underlying  custody  complaint  in  November  2021.  He 

filed it in Butler County, Pennsylvania, the site of the marital home. The parties 

could not reach a custody agreement after two custody conciliation hearings, 

and the court scheduled the matter for trial. Child’s mother, Alyssa M. Brown 

(“Mother”), filed a pre-trial motion to transfer the action to Maryland based 

on  inconvenient  forum.1  By  that  time,  Mother  had  relocated  with  Child  to 

Maryland, and Father resided in Virginia. Given the age and progression of the

case, and the need to decide the matter expeditiously, the court denied the 

motion to transfer and proceeded to trial.  

 

Following trial, the court entered an order awarding the parties shared 

custody of Child. The order concluded, “Because of the geographical locations 

of the parties, this Court relinquishes its jurisdiction to the above-captioned 

matter. If any further disputes arise, they are more appropriately raised in the 

courts of either Maryland or Virginia.” Memorandum and Order, 10/21/22, at 

14.  In  its  Rule  1925(a)  opinion,  the  trial  court  explains  that  it  relinquished 

jurisdiction  pursuant  to  the  Uniform  Child  Custody  Jurisdiction  and 

Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”). Trial Court Opinion, 11/2/22, at 4-5 (citing 23 

Pa.C.S.A.  §  5422(a)(1)).  It  found  neither  Child,  Mother,  Father,  nor  any 

person  acting  as  Child’s  parent  reside  in  Pennsylvania,  and  that  substantial 

evidence regarding Child’s care is not available in Pennsylvania. Id. at 4-5. 

 

Father  appealed. The sole issue Father raises on appeal is “[w]hether 

the  trial  court  prematurely  relinquished  jurisdiction  of  this  case[.]”  Father’s 

Br.  at  18.  Father  argues  that  the  trial  court’s  relinquishment  of  jurisdiction 

was premature, as no other state had accepted jurisdiction, which he claims 

is required by 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5424. Id. at 20-21. Father asserts that pursuant 

to  Section  5424,  the  court’s  order  should  have  specified  a  period  for  the 

parties  to  seek  an  order  from  another  state  with  jurisdiction  and 

communicated  with  that  court  before  relinquishing  jurisdiction.  Id.  at  21. 

Father  contends  that  the  court’s  premature  relinquishment  of  jurisdiction

deprives him of the ability to enforce the custody order. Id. Mother has not 

We review a custody court’s determination of whether it should continue 

to exercise jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. Billhime v. Billhime, 952 A.2d 

1174, 1176 (Pa.Super. 2008).  

The UCCJEA governs subject matter jurisdiction over child custody cases 

between  Pennsylvania  and  other  states.  J.S.  v.  R.S.S.,  231  A.3d  942,  947 

(Pa.Super. 2020). Under Section 5421(a), a court has jurisdiction to make an 

initial  custody  determination  when  certain  conditions  are  met,  such  as  if 

Pennsylvania is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement 

of  the  proceeding.  See,  e.g.,  23  Pa.C.S.A.  §  5421(a)(1).  After  the  initial 

custody determination has been made, Section 5422 governs the continuing 

jurisdiction of the court. See 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5422. It provides that the court 

that  “has  made  a  child  custody  determination  consistent  with  Section  5421 

(relating to initial child custody jurisdiction) or 5423 (relating to jurisdiction to 

modify determination)” maintains “exclusive, continuing jurisdiction” over the 

case “until” one of two situations arise: 

(1)  a  court  of  this  Commonwealth  determines  that  neither  the 
child,  nor  the  child  and  one  parent,  nor  the  child  and  a  person 
acting  as  a  parent  have  a  significant  connection  with  this 
Commonwealth  and  that  substantial  evidence  is  no  longer 
available  in  this  Commonwealth  concerning  the  child’s  care, 
protection, training and personal relationships; or 

(2)  a  court  of  this  Commonwealth  or  a  court  of  another  state 
determines  that  the  child,  the  child’s  parents  and  any  person 
acting as a parent do not presently reside in this Commonwealth.

J-S05032-23 

23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5422(a).  

Father does not contend that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make 

the  initial  custody  determination  order  under  Section  5421(a).  See  23 

Pa.C.S.A. § 5421 (“Initial child custody jurisdiction”). Nor does he argue that 

the  standard  at  Section  5422(a)(1),  establishing  the  court’s  continuing 

jurisdiction  ends  when  no  parties  have  significant  connection  with 

Pennsylvania,  has  not  been  met.  Rather,  Father  contends  the  court 

relinquished its continuing jurisdiction prematurely, because the court’s order 

does not meet the requirements of Section 5424.  

Section  5424  allows  a  court  to  exercise  temporary  emergency 

jurisdiction. See 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5424. It provides rules for how long an order 

made under such jurisdiction remains in effect, and under what circumstances 

the temporary emergency jurisdiction shall end.2 Here, Father did not move

____________________________________________ 

sections 5421 (relating to initial child custody jurisdiction) through 
5423  (relating  to  jurisdiction  to  modify  determination),  a  child 
custody determination made under this section remains in effect 
until an order is obtained from a court of a state having jurisdiction 
under sections 5421 through 5423. If a child custody proceeding 
has  not  been  or  is  not  commenced  in  a  court  of  a  state  having 
jurisdiction  under  sections  5421  through  5423,  a  child  custody 
determination  made  under  this  section  becomes  a 
final 
determination if it so provides and this Commonwealth becomes 
the home state of the child. 

(c) Previous custody determination or proceeding.--If there 
is  a  previous  child  custody  determination  that  is  entitled  to  be 
enforced  under  this  chapter  or  a  child  custody  proceeding  has 
been commenced  in a court of a state having jurisdiction under 
sections 5421 through 5423, any order issued by a court of this 
Commonwealth  under  this  section  must  specify  in  the  order  a 
period  that  the  court  considers  adequate  to  allow  the  person 
seeking  an  order  to  obtain  an  order  from  the  state  having 
jurisdiction under sections 5421 through 5423. The order issued 
in this Commonwealth remains in effect until an order is obtained 
from  the  other  state  within  the  period  specified  or  the  period 
expires. 

(d) Mandatory communication between courts.--A  court  of 
this Commonwealth which has been asked to make a child custody 
determination under this section, upon being informed that a child 
custody  proceeding  has  been  commenced  in  or  a  child  custody 
determination  has  been  made  by  a  court  of  a  state  having 
jurisdiction under sections 5421 through 5423, shall immediately 
communicate with the other court. A court of this Commonwealth 
which is exercising jurisdiction pursuant to sections 5421 through 
5423,  upon  being  informed  that  a  child  custody  proceeding  has 
been  commenced  in  or  a  child  custody  determination  has  been 
made by a court of another state under a statute similar to this 
section,  shall  immediately  communicate  with  the  court  of  that 
state to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties 
and  the  child  and  determine  a  period  for  the  duration  of  the 
temporary order. 

23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5424.

J-S05032-23 

for temporary emergency jurisdiction under Section 5424, and the trial court 

did  not  exercise  temporary  emergency  jurisdiction.  It  appears  to  have 

exercised jurisdiction under Section 5421(a). Therefore, Section 5424’s rules 

regarding  the  termination  or  relinquishment  of  temporary  emergency 

jurisdiction do not apply.  

Rather, the trial court, after exercising initial jurisdiction under Section 

5421(a),  applied  Section  5422(a)(1)  and  relinquished  jurisdiction.  It 

determined “that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child 

and  a  person  acting  as  a  parent  have  a  significant  connection  with  this 

Commonwealth  and  that  substantial  evidence  is  no  longer  available  in  this 

Commonwealth concerning the child’s care, protection, training and personal 

relationships.” 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 5422(a)(1); see Trial Ct. Op. at 4-5. The record 

supports these findings, and the court did not abuse its discretion in making 

this determination and relinquishing jurisdiction. Insofar as Father contends 

that the relinquishment deprives him of the ability to enforce the order, that 

question  is  not  ripe  for  our  consideration,  given  that  he  has  not  sought

enforcement.  

Order affirmed.
