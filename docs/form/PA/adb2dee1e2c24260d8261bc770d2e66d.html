Effective August 30, 2022 

AMENDED PROTOCOLS FOR IN-PERSON PROCEEDINGS BEFORE 
THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 

Upon consideration of the most recent public health guidance as set forth by 
the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  and  Pennsylvania 
Department of Health (DOH), and with agreement of the Commissioned Judges of 
the  Commonwealth  Court  of  Pennsylvania  (Court),  the  COVID-19  Protocols  set 
forth in the Court’s Notice dated September 10, 2021 related to In-Person, Single-
Judge Proceedings,  and the  Court’s Notice  dated  September 17, 2021,  related to 
October 2021 Oral Argument Session are AMENDED as follows: 

   

1.  The wearing of masks or face coverings in the courtroom and the restrictions 
on and  limitation of persons who may be  present in the  courtroom will no 
longer be in effect unless otherwise ordered by the presiding Judge or required 
by  the  facility  in  which  the  proceeding  is  being  held.    Although no  longer 
required,  all  persons  are  permitted  and  encouraged  to  wear  a  mask  or  face 
covering and/or practice social distancing in the courtroom if they wish to do 
so.    Everyone  is  asked  to  respect  the  independent  health  decisions  of  the 
parties, attendees, and court staff in this regard. 
 

2.  All  forms,  attestations,  and  certifications  previously  required  are  no  longer 
required.   This includes  the “In-Person  Proceeding  Sign-in  and  COVID-19 
Attestation  Form,”  which  all  persons  attending  a  Commonwealth  Court 
proceeding  were  required  to  complete  for  purposes  of  contact-tracing.  
However,  any  person  who  participates  in  or  observes  a  proceeding  and 
subsequently tests positive for COVID-19 within five days of attending the 
proceeding shall immediately notify the Prothonotary’s Office at (717) 255-
1661.  If the Court receives such notification, a generic notice to that effect 
will be posted on the Court’s website.  Attendees are encouraged to monitor 
the Court’s website for such notification.  
 

3.  No person who has symptoms of respiratory illness or fever, or is currently 
COVID-19  positive,  may  attend  a  proceeding  as  counsel,  a  party,  witness, 
credentialed member of the media, or public observer.  Counsel, parties, or 
witnesses experiencing any COVID-19-related symptoms or who are required 
to quarantine or isolate should advise the Prothonotary’s Office at (717) 255-
1661 as soon as possible of the inability to attend an in-person proceeding.  In 

Effective August 30, 2022 

this event, they must also promptly file an application to appear remotely or 
to continue the matter. 
 

4.  The  Court  recognizes  that  counsel,  parties,  witnesses,  or  members  of  their 
respective  households  may  be  at  increased  risk  for  severe  illness  due  to 
COVID-19 as currently defined by the CDC.  Accordingly, requests to appear 
remotely by advanced communication technology (Cisco WebEx®) will still 
be entertained by the presiding Judge in such circumstances.  To request to 
participate in a proceeding remotely because of a COVID-19-related medical 
risk,  counsel  for  whom  leave  to  appear  remotely  is  sought  or  counsel 
representing the party or calling the witness for whom accommodations are 
being sought, shall file an application in accordance with Pa.R.A.P. 123.1  The 
application  should  be  filed  within  seven  days  of  receipt  of  the  notice 
scheduling oral argument or an order scheduling a proceeding or as soon as 
otherwise practicable.  The individual seeking leave to participate remotely 
shall  declare,  under  penalty  of  perjury,  that  their  travel  to,  and  physical 
presence at, the proceeding would place them or a person in their household 
at an unacceptable risk of developing health complications from COVID-19. 
A  copy  of  the  application  should  be  served  on  the  opposing  parties  and/or 
counsel.    No  other  proof  or  evidence,  including  confidential  medical 
information,  in  support  of  the  application  is  needed.    Consistent  with 
Pa.R.A.P.  3707,  the  application  should  indicate  whether  the  other  parties 
concur with the relief sought.  Absent extenuating circumstances, requests for 
a “hybrid” proceeding, with less than all parties participating remotely, will 
not be entertained.  Requests will not be granted for only the convenience or 
preference or for economic reasons.  If a matter is scheduled for oral argument 
and approved for remote argument, it will be heard following all in-person 
arguments scheduled for the same date and time, i.e., at the end of the list. 
Proceedings  in  which  the  Court  permits  remote  arguments  will  follow  the 
Court’s protocols and directions for remote proceedings.2  Out of respect for 
the time and resources expended by the Court and the parties in preparation 
for a proceeding, every attempt will be made to proceed as scheduled.  

 

1 A sample application is attached as Appendix A. 
2 See Appendix B.  

   

5.  The Court will continue to provide a platform to livestream oral arguments 
and other proceedings, where appropriate, through a public web link that will 
be posted on the Court’s website in advance.  
 

6.  The Court will continue to monitor conditions with regard to COVID-19 in 
Pennsylvania,  including  COVID-19  Community  Levels  in  all  counties  and 
COVID-19  response  updates  in  individual  counties  and  will  amend  these 
Protocols as circumstances require. Accordingly, counsel, the public, and 
the media are advised to monitor individual case dockets and the Court’s 
website for additional information and updates.  

Effective August 30, 2022

COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA

APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAR REMOTELY AT ARGUMENT

Case Number:

Case Caption:

Filing Party:

Pursuant  to  the  Court’s  Amended  Protocols  for  In-Person  Proceedings,  the 

undersigned moves for leave to appear remotely in the above case at a date and time to 

be scheduled by the Court and declares the following:

1.

I  am  counsel  or  a  party  in  this  matter  and  am scheduled  to  appear

in  person  for  a proceeding before the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania 

on ______________________ at _____ a.m./p.m. in Courtroom ________________.

2.

Either I or a member of my immediate family living in my household is

at  increased risk for  severe  illness due  to  COVID-19 as currently  defined by 

the  U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.  My  travel  to,  and 

physical presence at, argument would place me or a person in my household at 

an unavoidable risk of developing serious health complications from COVID-

19  compared  to  what  I  ordinarily  would  experience  absent  such  travel  and 

physical presence in the courthouse.

3.

If my application is granted, I understand that I will be notified to

appear remotely for argument.

4.

If my motion is granted, I agree and understand that I must comply with

the Court’s protocols, instructions and directives for participating in remote

proceedings,  as  well  as  any  additional  instructions provided by Court staff.

I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

Protocol for WebEx Video Proceedings 

1. Protocol BEFORE the argument:

The Court shall provide counsel with the information for connecting 
to the video argument. This invitation will be sent by email. 

It is the responsibility of counsel to provide the connection 
information to their clients.  

It is the responsibility of all parties to provide the Court with their 
contact information. An email address will be required to join the 
video.  

All participants must appear by video connection unless otherwise 
authorized by the Court. 

Email invitations will be promptly sent to participants. If a participant 
has not received the email invitation from the Court, please check 
your SPAM or Junk folder before contacting the Court. 

All parties must connect to the argument or call into the video system 
at least 10 minutes before the scheduled start time.  

All attorneys and pro se parties appearing before the Court must have 
one of the following: 

A computer with a functioning web camera, microphone and 
speakers; 
A video conferencing system that supports Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) calling; 
A tablet device that supports Cisco WebEx with a functioning 
forward facing camera, microphone and speakers; or 
An alternative device used to connect to Cisco WebEx in the 
past. 

2. Minimum Technology requirements:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you experience audio issues with your computer/tablet audio, the 
Court recommends that you have our system call you by using the 
option listed in 5.C below. 

The Court’s IT Department will endeavor to contact counsel and 
witnesses in advance of the hearing to test their connection to the 
WebEx platform. 

3. Ground Rules and Video Conferencing Etiquette: 

  When not speaking, please mute your microphone. This helps prevent 

background noise.   

Earbuds or headphones are preferable to avoid feedback. 

Be aware of your behavior. Because you are on a video conference, 
people can see what you are doing at all times and WebEx video 
conferences are recorded.  Further, others may view the proceedings 
via public livestream web link that will be provided to the parties and 
posted to the Court’s website in advance of the proceeding. 

If connecting from a laptop, plug in the laptop wall power. 

Follow all instructions in the video conference invitation and note 
important supplemental information, such as a backup phone number 
in case you are disconnected. 

Please be respectful; speak slowly and only one at a time.   

Try not to speak over other parties. There is a slight delay when using 
video technology. 

The Court appointed crier will be on the call to open and close court 
and to swear-in witnesses if needed. 

Technical Support 
If you have any questions or need technical assistance, contact 717-255-1626.
