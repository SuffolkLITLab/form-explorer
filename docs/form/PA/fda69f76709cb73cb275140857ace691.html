Appellant 

 No. 2544 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Order Entered August 30, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County Civil Division at 
No(s):  200600297 

EFORE:  DUBOW, J., McLAUGHLIN, J., and McCAFFERY, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY McCAFFERY, J.: 

FILED MARCH 16, 2023 

 

Thomas Hopkins  (Appellant) appeals pro se from the order entered in 

the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition to open 

a confession of judgment in favor of 2327 E. York LLC (Appellee).  As will be 

discussed below, Appellant submits a two-page brief and a litany of exhibits 

with no explanation of their relevance to any purported argument.  Because 

we  conclude  that  Appellant’s  brief  is  fatally  deficient  and  he  failed  to  file  a 

timely petition to open the confessed judgment, we affirm.   

 

Due  to  our  disposition  of  this  appeal,  a  detailed  description  of  the 

underlying  factual  history  is  unnecessary.    Briefly,  Appellant  entered  into  a 

five-year  commercial  lease  agreement  with  Appellee  for  the  rental  of  a 

property  located  on  East  York  Street  (Property)  in  Philadelphia,  which 

commenced  on  June  21,  2019.    See  Lease  Agreement,  6/21/19,  at  1 

(unpaginated).  The lease required Appellant to pay rent on the first of each

month in the sum of $4,000.00 beginning on July 1, 2019.1  Id. at 1-2.  The 

lease agreement also included the following terms: 

24. Events of Default; Remedies. 

 

 

*     *     * 

(c)  If  [Appellant]  shall  default  in  the  payment  of  the  rent 
reserved or in the payment of any other sums due hereunder by 
[Appellant,  Appellant]  hereby  authorizes  and  empowers  any 
prothonotary  or  attorney  of  any  court  of  record  to  appear  for 
[Appellant] in any and all actions which may be brought for said 
rent  and/or  said  other  sums;  to  confess  judgment  against 
[Appellant] for all or any part of said rent and/or said other 
sums;  including  but  not  limited  to  the  amounts  due  from 
[Appellant] to [Appellee] under subsections, (I), (II), (III) of this 
section;  and  for  interest  and  costs  together  with  an  attorney’s 
commission  for  collection  of  [5%].    Such  authority  shall  not  be 
exhausted  by  one  exercise  thereof,  but  judgment  may  be 
confessed as aforesaid from time to time as often as any of said 
rent and/or other  sums shall fall due or  be in arrears, and such 
powers may be exercised as well after the expiration of the initial 
term of this lease and/or during any extended or renewal term of 
this lease and/or after the expiration of any extended or renewal 
term of this lease. 

(d) Upon an event of default hereunder or the expiration of 
the  term  of  this  lease,  [Appellant]  hereby  authorizes  and 
empowers any prothonotary or attorney of any court of record to 
appear for [Appellant] in any and all actions which may be brought 
for  the  recovery  by  [Appellee]  of  possession  of  the  demised 
premises, and confession of judgment in ejectment for which this 
lease  shall  be  his  sufficient  warrant;  thereupon,  if  [Appellee]  so 
desires,  an  appropriate  writ  of  possession  may  issue  forthwith, 
without  any  prior  writ  or  proceeding  whatsoever,  and  provided 

____________________________________________ 

1  Under  the  terms  of  the  lease,  rent  for  Property  was  to  be  raised  at  the 
conclusion of each year to a predetermined amount.  See Lease Agreement 
at 2.  Rent for Property was $4,000.00 a month for the period of July 1, 2019, 
through June 30, 2020.

J-A07031-23 

that  if  for  any  reason  after  such  action  shall  have  been 
commenced it shall be determined and possession of the demised 
premises remain in or be restored to [Appellant], [Appellee] shall 
have  the  right  for  the  same  default  and  upon  any  subsequent 
default  or  defaults  or  upon  the  termination  of  this  lease  or 
[Appellant]’s  rights  of  possession  as  hereinbefore  set  forth,  to 
confess one or more judgments in ejectment as hereinbefore set 
forth  to  recover  possession  of  the  demised  premises.    Such 
authority shall not be exhausted by one exercise thereof, and such 
authority may be exercised as well after the expiration of the term 
of this lease. 

 
(e) In any confessed judgment of ejectment and or for rent 
and/or other sums brought hereon, [Appellee] shall first cause to 
be filed in such action an affidavit made by [Appellee] or someone 
acting for [Appellee], setting forth the facts necessary to authorize 
the entry of judgment, of which facts such affidavit shall be prima 
facie evidence, and if a true copy of this [l]ease shall be filed in 
such  suit,  action  or  actions,  it  shall  not  be  necessary  to  file  the 
original as a warrant of attorney, any rule of [c]ourt, custom or 
practice to the contrary notwithstanding. 
 

*     *     * 

This  [l]ease  contains  the  entire  agreement  between  the 
 
parties  relating  to  the  subject  matter  hereof  and  shall  not  be 
changed, modified, terminated or discharged, in whole or in part, 
unless by an agreement in writing and signed by both parties.

Id.  at  11,  13-14,  21  (emphasis  added  &  some  capitalization  omitted; 

Appellant  purportedly  paid  rent  “in  accordance  with  the  [l]ease”  until 

September 2019 and then “surrendered the premises” back to Appellee.  See 

Appellee’s  Complaint  —  Confession  of  Judgment  Pursuant  to  Warrant  of

Attorney  (Appellee’s  Complaint),  6/5/2020,  at  5.2    Appellee  did  not  locate 

another tenant until January 2020.  Id.   

On June 5, 2020, Appellee filed a complaint in confession of judgment 

against Appellant.  In the complaint, Appellee alleged that Appellant failed to 

pay  attorney’s  fees,  court  costs,  and  rent  “through  the  end  of  December, 

2019[,]” which amounted to $30,639.41.  Appellee’s Complaint at 5.  Appellee 

also averred that “despite repeated demands[,]” and “notice pursuant to the 

[l]ease”  that  Appellant  was  in  default,  he  continued  to  refuse  to  pay  these 

amounts.    Id.    Appellee  demanded  a  money  judgment  in  its  favor  against 

Appellant.  Id. at 6.  Appellee also attached a copy of the lease signed by the 

parties  to  the  complaint.    Appellant  was  served  with  the  confession  of 

judgment  on  August  10,  2020.3    On  December  23,  2020,  Appellee  filed  a 

On  April  16,  2021,  Appellant  was  served  with  a  notice  of  taking  a 

deposition in aid of execution for a May 17, 2021, deposition.  See Appellee’s 

Notice of Taking a Deposition in Aid of Execution, 4/16/21.  Appellant failed to 

appear.  Appellee then filed a motion to compel Appellant’s deposition, which 

the trial court granted on August 26, 2021.  See Appellee’s Motion to Compel 

Deposition  of  Appellant,  6/8/21,  at  1  (unpaginated);  Order,  8/26/21.    On

September  9,  2021,  Appellant  was  served  with  notice  of  the  court’s  order.  

See Return of Service, 9/22/21.  The limited record does not indicate if the 

second scheduled deposition occurred or if Appellant attended.   

On  June  6,  2022,  Appellant  filed  a  petition  to  open  the  confessed 

judgment.  It appears that in lieu of a brief in support of his petition, Appellant 

filed a one-page, pro se document requesting a hearing to present evidence 

that  he  made  payments  for  past  rent  amounting  to  $16,000.00.    See 

Appellant’s Pro Se Petition to Open Judgment, 6/6/22, at 5 (unpaginated).  He 

alleges  these  payments  were  made  “from  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  the 

business in question.”  Id.   

Appellee responded to the petition, denying that Appellant “made any 

payments towards the confessed judgment” and in the event he did, Appellant 

“failed to timely allege said payments were made[.]”  Appellee’s Response to 

Appellant’s  Petition  to  Open  Confessed  Judgment  and  to  Stay  Execution, 

On  June  22,  2022,  Appellant  filed  an  answer  to  Appellee’s  response, 

6/14/22, at 1.   

alleging the following:  

 

On  August  5th  2020[,]  I  had  a  medical  emergency  occur 
(spontaneous  subdural  hematoma)  and  was  transported  to 
Cooper Medical Center in Camden, NJ for emergency treatment.  
I was released on August 9th.  The following week on August 17th 
another  episode  occurred  and  I  was  transported  to  Temple 
University  Medical  Center  where  an  [emergency]  medical 
procedure  (surgery  to  correct  the  brain  hematoma)  was 
completed.  I was discharged from the Temple University Medical 
Center on August 19th to complete recovery steps.  The summary 

- 5 - 

documents  relating  to  these  events  are  included  with  this 
response. 

I did not see the initial request from [Appellee]’s counsel but 
did  see  subsequent  requests.    My  efforts  to  hire  a  lawyer  to 
represent me had been hampered by the financial distress I was 
in  through  August  2021.    In  September  2021[,]  I  was  able  to 
retain a lawyer to represent me in this matter with the goal of a 
fair settlement of the case based on the fact that there is $16,000 
unaccounted for in total payments made to the  [Appellee].  The 
[Appellee] has not agreed with the offers presented.  At this time 
I am representing myself and request the case [be] opened and 
reviewed by the court so I can provide my records on this matter.   

Appellant’s  Answer  to  Appellee’s  Opposition  of  Petition  to  Open  Judgment,4 

6/22/22, at 5 (unpaginated).   

On August 30, 2022,5 the trial court denied Appellant’s petition to open 

confessed  judgment  without  holding  an  evidentiary  hearing.    See  Order, 

8/30/22.  The court did not provide its reasons for denying the petition or file 

an  opinion  in  support.    After  entering  the  order,  the  assigned  trial  judge 

resigned  from  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  of  Philadelphia.    See  Letter, 

11/15/22.    A  new  trial  judge  was  not  assigned  to  the  matter.    This  timely 

appeal followed.   

Before addressing any purported claims on appeal, we must determine 

whether  Appellant’s  brief  complies  with  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Appellate 

4  We  note  Appellant  titled  the  document,  “Answer  to  Response  Filed  by 
Appellee’s Counsel.”  We changed the name to properly identify the nature of 
the filing. 

 The trial court’s order is dated August 29, 2022, but it was not entered onto 
the docket until August 30th.  See Order, 8/30/22.

Procedure.    The  entirety  of  Appellant’s  brief  is  two  pages  in  length,  and 

consists of one paragraph, which is as follows:   

equest for the Superior Court to open the [t]rial [c]ourt Docket 
No[.]  200600297  [Judgment]  for  further  review  of  the  details 
regarding  proceeds  applied  to  outstanding  balances  owed.    The 
dispute is specifically related to the payment of 4 months of back-
rent ($16k) owed to [Appellee] from the proceeds of the sale of 
the  business.    These  funds  have  not  been  applied  as  agreed.  
[Appellee]  did  not  deliver  any  invoice  or  documentation  for 
outstanding  costs  to  date  that  conflict  with  the  enclosed 
supporting documentation. 

Enclosed are supporting documents related to this appeal. 

  R

Appellant’s  Brief  at  1  (unpaginated;  grammatical  errors  in  original).    The 

second page of Appellant’s brief is an index of attached exhibits.  Id. at 2.   

Appellant’s pro se brief materially fails to conform to the requirements 

set  forth  in  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure.    See  Pa.R.A.P. 

2111(a).    Specifically,  Appellant’s  brief  either  entirely  omits  or  does  not 

adequately include a statement of jurisdiction, reference to the order or other 

determination  in  question,  statement  of  the  scope  and  standard  of  review, 

statement of the questions involved, a statement of the case, a summary of 

the argument, and argument for Appellant.  See Pa.R.A.P. 2111(a)(3), 2114, 

2115(a), 2116(a), 2117(a), 2118, 2119.  Most notably, Appellant fails to refer 

to any part of the record and does not cite any legal authority in support of 

his contention.  See Pa.R.A.P. 2119(b)-(c).   

Although this Court is willing to construe briefs filed by a pro se litigants 

liberally, pro se status generally confers no special benefit upon an appellant.  

See  Elliot-Greenleaf,  P.C.  v.  Rothstein,  255  A.3d  539,  542  (Pa.  Super. 

- 7 - 

J-A07031-23 

2021).    Our  Supreme  Court  has  noted  that  when  a  lay  person  represents 

themselves  in  a  legal  proceeding,  they  “must,  to  some  reasonable  extent, 

assume  the  risk  that  [their]  lack  of  expertise  and  legal  training  will  prove 

[their] undoing.”  See id. (citation omitted).  This Court has previously stated: 

We]  will  not  act  as  counsel  and  will  not  develop  arguments  on 
behalf  of  an  appellant.    When  deficiencies  in  a  brief  hinder  our 
ability  to  conduct  meaningful  appellate  review,  we  may  dismiss 
the appeal entirely or find certain issues to be waived.  It is not 
this Court’s responsibility to comb through the record seeking the 
factual underpinnings of [a party’s] claim. 

Irwin Union Nat’l Bank & Trust Co. v. Famous, 4 A.3d 1099, 1103 (Pa. 

Super. 2010) (citations omitted).   

 

In  the  present  case,  Appellant  fails  to  even  provide  a  statement  of 

questions  involved  or  any  argument  in  support  of  his  bald  assertions.    We 

emphasize: 

omitted).   

T]he  omission  of  a  statement  of  questions  presented  is 
particularly grievous since the statement . . . defines the specific 
issues this [C]ourt is asked to review.  When the omission of the 
statement of questions presented is combined with the lack of any 
organized  and  developed  arguments,  it  becomes  clear  that 
appellant’s brief is insufficient to allow us to conduct meaningful 
judicial review. 

Smathers v. Smathers, 670 A.2d 1159, 1160 (Pa. Super. 1996) (citations 

  [

  [

We  find  Appellant’s  two-page  brief,  consisting  of  one  paragraph 

requesting “further review” of his petition to open judgment, and an index of 

miscellaneous exhibits, does not comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure.  

We cannot presume what arguments he meant to put forth, nor can we simply 

- 8 - 

J-A07031-23 

J-A07031-23 

speculate or assume his intended purpose for each of the attached exhibits.  

As  there  is  no  discernable  argument  presented  before  us,  we  conclude 

Appellant’s  claims  are  waived  on  this  basis.    See  Pa.R.A.P.  2119(a)  (the 

argument section of an appellate brief must provide “discussion and citation 

of  authorities  as  are  deemed  pertinent.”);  see  Irwin  Union  Nat’l  Bank  & 

Trust Co., 4 A.3d at 1103 (“When deficiencies in a brief hinder our ability to 

conduct  meaningful  appellate  review,  we  may  .  .  .  find  certain  issues  to  be 

waived.”); see Butler v. Illes, 747 A.2d 943, 944 (Pa. Super. 2000) (“When 

issues are not properly raised and developed in briefs, when briefs are wholly 

inadequate to present specific issues for review, a court will not consider the 

merits thereof.”) (citation & internal quotation marks omitted). 

Moreover, even if we were to determine that Appellant’s brief complied 

with the Rules of Appellate Procedure, we would conclude no relief is due.  We 

review  a  trial  court’s  ruling  on  a  petition  to  strike  or  open  a  confessed 

judgment for an abuse of discretion or error of law.  See Ferrick v. Bianchini, 

69 A.3d 642, 647 (Pa. Super. 2013).  Our scope of review on appeal is “very 

narrow” and we will overturn the trial court’s decision only if the “court abused 

its  discretion  or  committed  manifest  error.”    Atlantic  Nat'l  Trust,  LLC  v. 

Stivala Invs., Inc., 922 A.2d 919, 925 (Pa. Super. 2007) (citation omitted). 

Where the factual averments in a complaint of a confession of judgment 

are  contested,  a  petitioner  may  seek  remedy  through  a  petition  to  open 

judgment.  See Neducsin v. Caplan, 121 A.3d 498, 504 (Pa. Super. 2015).  

“A petition to open a confessed judgment is an appeal to the equitable powers 

- 9 - 

of the court.”  Id.  The court may open a confessed judgment “if the petitioner 

(1)  acts  promptly,  (2)  alleges  a  meritorious  defense,  and  (3)  can  produce 

sufficient evidence to require submission of the case to a jury.”   Id. at 506 

(citation  and  emphasis  omitted).    When  a  petitioner  is  served  with  written 

notice of the confessed judgment pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 2956.1(c)(2),6 they 

may file a petition to open the judgment within 30 days after that date, unless 

they  can  demonstrate  a  compelling  reason  for  the  delay.    Pa.R.C.P. 

2959(a)(3).  An untimely petition will be denied.  See id.   

Here,  Appellee  filed  a  confession  of  judgment  on  June  5,  2020,7  and 

served it on Appellant on September 23rd.  Appellee then filed a praecipe for 

writ of execution on December 23rd.  Appellee indicated that notice had been 

served at least 30 days prior to the filing of the praecipe for writ of execution 

as evidenced by a return of service filed of record.  See Appellee’s Praecipe 

for Writ of Execution Upon A Confessed Judgment, 12/23/20, at 2.  As such, 

Appellant had 30 days from the date of service of the confession of judgment 

— or October 23, 2020 — to file a petition to open judgment.  See Pa.R.C.P. 

236(b); Pa.R.C.P. 2956(c)(2)(i).   

____________________________________________ 

6  Rule  2956.1  dictates  that  an  “[e]xecution  upon  a  judgment  entered  by 
confession  .  .  .  shall  be  .  .  .  conditioned  upon  the  service  of  notice  on  the 
defendant in the judgment . . . at least thirty days prior to the filing of the 
praecipe for the writ of execution[.]”  Pa.R.C.P. 2956.1(c)(2)(i).   

 Notice under  Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 236(b) was provided to 
Appellant.  See Pa.R.C.P. 236(b) (“The prothonotary shall note in the docket 
the giving of the notice and, when a judgment by confession is entered, the 
mailing of the required notice and documents.”).

Appellant filed a petition to open on June 6, 2022, over one and a half 

years after the deadline to file had expired.  He did not state that he never 

received the complaint or the confessed judgment, rather,  he explained  his 

late filing was due financial difficulties after experiencing medical emergencies 

in  August  2020.8    See  Appellant’s  Answer  to  Response  Filed  by  Appellee’s 

Counsel, at 5 (unpaginated).   

Appellant did not “act promptly” nor did he provide the trial court with 

a  “compelling  reason”  for  the  one-and-a-half-year  delay.    See  Pa.R.C.P. 

2959(a)(3); Neducsin, 121 A.3d at 506.  It merits mention that Appellant’s 

financial  difficulties  do  not  afford  him  an  unlimited  filing  extension  until  he 

resolves his financial hardships.  Moreover, we note that in his June 22, 2022, 

answer, Appellant  admitted that he was no longer in financial distress after 

August  2021  and  had  retained  legal  counsel  in  September  2021.9    See 

Appellant’s  Answer  to  Response  Filed  by  Appellee’s  Counsel,  at  5 

(unpaginated).    Despite  this,  Appellant  waited  approximately  nine  more 

8 In his response to Appellee, we note that Appellant stated he “did not see 
the initial request from [Appellee’s] counsel but did see subsequent requests.”  
See  Appellant’s  Answer  to  Response  Filed  by  Appellee’s  Counsel,  at  5 
(unpaginated).  Appellant did not indicate what “requests” he was referencing 
or what the subject of the “requests” were.   

 Appellant has proceeded pro se throughout the present appeal.  It is unclear 
when he decided to move forward without counsel.

months to file a petition to open the confessed judgment.10  Accordingly, we 

would  conclude  the  trial  court  did  not  abuse  its  discretion  when  it  denied 

Appellant’s petition.   

In  sum,  the  defects  regarding  Appellant’s  appellate  brief  preclude  us 

from conducting meaningful review, and further, his petition to open was filed 

beyond  the  deadline  without  compelling  reason  for  the  delay.    As  such,  we 

need not address  this  appeal further.   Therefore, we affirm the  trial court’s 

August  30,  2022,  order  denying  Appellant’s  petition  to  open  the  confessed 

Order affirmed.  We direct the Prothonotary to remove this case from 

judgment.

10 We acknowledge that even if Appellant filed his petition when he retained 
counsel  in  September  2021,  it  would  still  be  filed  after  the  30-day  filing 
deadline, and he would still be required to demonstrate a reason for the delay.
