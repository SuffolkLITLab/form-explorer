Appellant 

 No. 695 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered April 12, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-22-CR-0002936-2018 

EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., OLSON, J., and DUBOW, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY OLSON, J.: 

FILED:  MARCH 17, 2023 

Appellant,  Courtney  Lamar  Slade,  appeals  from  the  order  entered  on 

April 12, 2022, which denied his petition filed under the Post Conviction Relief 

Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9541-9546.  We affirm. 

We previously summarized the underlying facts of this case: 

 

 

  A

ppellant  and  a  cohort  forcibly  entered  a  home  in  a 
residential neighborhood at night.  Inside the home were two 
adult men, one adult female, and two six-year-old children.  
Appellant  and  his  companion  were  wearing  gloves  and 
masks, and both were carrying guns.  They held a gun to the 
head of the adult female, and also pointed their guns at the 
two children.  Additionally, a scuffle ensued with one of the 
adult  male  victims,  and  he  was  badly  beaten  by  Appellant 
and/or his companion.  Appellant and his cohort left the home 
with approximately $900 and gaming equipment.  Appellant, 
who had been cut during the altercation with the victim, was 
subsequently identified by DNA evidence obtained from blood 
found inside the home.

Commonwealth v. Slade, 240 A.3d 935 (Pa. Super. 2020) (non-precedential 

On October 21, 2019, Appellant entered an open guilty plea to robbery, 

aggravated  assault,  and  burglary;1  on  December  18,  2019,  the  trial  court 

sentenced Appellant to serve an aggregate term of 15 and one-half to 40 years 

in  prison  for  his  convictions.    N.T.  Guilty  Plea,  10/21/19,  at  1-7;  N.T. 

Sentencing,  12/19/21,  at  18-19.    We  affirmed  Appellant’s  judgment  of 

sentence on September 16, 2020.  Commonwealth v. Slade, 240 A.3d 935 

(Pa. Super. 2020) (non-precedential decision) at 1-6. 

On  April  5,  2021,  Appellant  filed  a  timely,  pro  se  PCRA  petition.    The 

PCRA court appointed counsel to represent Appellant during the proceedings 

and counsel eventually filed an amended petition on Appellant’s behalf.  Within 

the amended petition, Appellant claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective 

“for  failing  to  seek  [a  mental  health]  evaluation  to  see  if  [Appellant  were] 

competent to stand trial in this matter” and for “advising [Appellant] to take 

an  open  plea  deal  instead  of  taking  a  plea  deal  with  a  negotiated  sentence 

that was offered by the Commonwealth.”  Amended PCRA Petition, 10/7/21, 

at 7 and 14. 

The PCRA court held a hearing on Appellant’s petition on March 18, 2022 

and,  during  the  hearing,  both  Appellant’s  trial  counsel  (hereinafter  “Trial 

Counsel”)  and  Appellant  testified.    Trial  Counsel  testified  that,  when  he

represented Appellant, he was aware that Appellant had been “diagnosed with 

being  bipolar  and  having  schizophrenia.”    PCRA  Hearing,  3/18/22,  at  4.  

However,  Trial Counsel testified  that he did  not discuss an insanity defense 

with Appellant because “throughout all of my interactions with [Appellant, his 

mental  health]  didn’t  seem  like  it  was  an  issue  that  was  going  to  lead  us 

anywhere or be something that I felt was going to be productive in terms that 

it wasn’t a concern that I had that he was not competent to stand trial.”  Id. 

at  5.    Further,  Trial  Counsel  testified  that,  when  he  represented  Appellant:  

Appellant’s mental health did not impede Appellant’s ability to participate in 

his  own  defense;  Appellant’s  mental  health  did  not  impede  Trial  Counsel’s 

ability to help prepare Appellant’s defense; and, nothing “st[ood] out to [Trial 

Counsel] in terms of [Appellant] having comprehension issues or anything like 

that.”  Id. at 5 and 8-9. 

Regarding Appellant’s decision to reject the Commonwealth’s offer of a 

negotiated sentence, Trial Counsel testified: 

o, if I recall correctly, negotiations had gone on for quite a 
while  between  myself  and  the  District  Attorney's  Office. 
Ultimately, I think where things ended up was, there was an 
offer  for  [eight]  and  a  half  to  20.  I  talked  with  [Appellant] 
about that, and I explained to him that if he plead[ed] open 
there  was  certainly  a  chance  that  he  would  get  a  lesser 
sentence, but there was also a chance that he would get more 
than that.   If  I remember, I  think  the  guidelines  started at 
[six] and a half years.  So he, I think, was hoping that if he 
plead[ed]  open,  he  would  get  something  closer  to  that 
bottom range.  I don't recall quite frankly whether I advised 
him  one  way  or  the  other  as  far  as  what  I  think  the  best 
option is or what he should do.  I explained to him what the 
options were, and I let him decide.

Appellant  testified  that  Trial  Counsel  advised  him  to  reject  the 

Commonwealth’s offer and to simply enter an open guilty plea.  According to 

Appellant,  Trial  Counsel  told  him  that  the  trial  court  “wouldn’t  go  over  the 

[eight] and a half that was offered” by the Commonwealth and would probably 

sentence Appellant to a standard guideline range sentence of six and a half 

years in prison.  Id. at 14.  

The  PCRA  court  denied  Appellant’s  petition  on  April  12,  2022  and 

Appellant  filed  a  timely  notice  of  appeal.    Appellant  raises  two  claims  on 

hether the [PCRA] court erred in denying Appellant’s PCRA 
petition where he presented a preponderance of the evidence 
that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. 
 

1.  Ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  in  failing  to  seek  a 
mental health evaluation. 

. Ineffective assistance of counsel in advising Appellant 

to reject the negotiated plea agreement.

Appellant’s Brief at 4 (some capitalization omitted). 

“We  review  a  ruling  by  the  PCRA  court  to  determine  whether  it  is 

supported by the record and is free of legal error.  Our standard of review of 

a PCRA court's  legal conclusions is  de  novo.”  Commonwealth v. Cousar, 

154 A.3d 287, 296 (Pa. 2017) (citations omitted).  However, we afford “great 

deference” to the PCRA court’s credibility determinations.   Commonwealth

v.  Flor,  259  A.3d  891,  910-911  (Pa.  2021).    As  our  Supreme  Court  has 

e will not disturb the findings of the PCRA court if they are 
supported  by  the  record,  even  where  the  record  could 
support a contrary holding.  [An appellate court’s] scope of 
review  is  limited  to  the  findings  of  the  PCRA  court  and  the 
evidence on the record of the PCRA court's hearing, viewed 
in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. 

Id.  (quotation marks and citations omitted). 

To be eligible for relief under the PCRA, the petitioner must plead and 

prove  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  his  conviction  or  sentence 

resulted  from  “one  or  more”  of  the  seven,  specifically  enumerated 

circumstances listed in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(2).  One of these statutorily 

enumerated circumstances is the “[i]neffective assistance of counsel which, in 

the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the truth-determining 

process  that  no  reliable  adjudication  of  guilt  or  innocence  could  have  taken 

place.”  42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(2)(ii).    

Counsel is presumed to be effective and “the burden of demonstrating 

ineffectiveness  rests  on  [A]ppellant.”    Commonwealth  v.  Rivera,  10  A.3d 

1276, 1279 (Pa. Super. 2010).  To satisfy this burden, Appellant must plead 

and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: 

(1)  his  underlying  claim  is  of  arguable  merit;  (2)  the 
particular course of conduct pursued by counsel did not have 
some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his interests; 
and,  (3)  but  for  counsel’s  ineffectiveness,  there  is  a 
reasonable  probability  that  the  outcome  of  the  challenged 
proceedings would have been different.

explained: 

Commonwealth v. Fulton, 830 A.2d 567, 572 (Pa. 2003).  As this Court has 

 

 

 

A claim has arguable merit where the factual averments, if 
accurate,  could  establish  cause 
  See 
Commonwealth  v.  Jones,  876  A.2d  380,  385  (Pa.  2005) 
(“if a petitioner raises allegations, which, even if accepted as 
true, do not establish the underlying claim . .  . , he or she 
will have failed to establish the arguable merit prong related 
to the claim”).  Whether the facts rise to the level of arguable 
merit is a legal determination. 

relief. 

for 

The test for deciding whether counsel had a reasonable basis 
for  his  action  or  inaction  is  whether  no  competent  counsel 
would have chosen that action or inaction, or, the alternative, 
not chosen, offered a significantly greater potential chance of 
success.  Counsel’s decisions will be considered reasonable if 
they effectuated his client's interests.  We do not employ a 
hindsight  analysis  in  comparing  trial  counsel's  actions  with 
other efforts he may have taken.  

Prejudice  is  established  if  there  is  a  reasonable  probability 
that,  but  for  counsel’s  errors,  the  result  of  the  proceeding 
would  have  been  different.    A  reasonable  probability  is  a 
probability  sufficient  to  undermine  confidence 
in  the 
outcome. 

Commonwealth  v.  Stewart,  84  A.3d  701,  707  (Pa.  Super.  2013)  (some 

quotations and citations omitted).  “A failure to satisfy any prong of the test 

for ineffectiveness will require rejection of the claim.”  Id. 

First, Appellant claims that Trial Counsel was ineffective because counsel 

failed to seek a mental health evaluation, which, Appellant claims, would have 

enabled  counsel  to  “consider  an  insanity  defense.”    Appellant’s  Brief  at  14.  

This claim fails. 
 

- 6 - 

In  order  to  prevail  on  an  insanity  defense,  [an  a]ppellant 
must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the 
time he committed the offense, due to a defect of reason or 
disease of mind, he either did not know the nature and quality 
of the act or did not know that the act was wrong. 

Commonwealth  v.  Smith,  17  A.3d  873,  901  (Pa.  2011);  see  also 

Commonwealth v. Hughes, 865 A.2d 761, 788 (Pa. 2004) (“[a] defense of 

insanity  acknowledges  commission  of  the  act  by  the  defendant,  while 

maintaining the absence of legal culpability”). 

During  the  PCRA  hearing,  Appellant  did  not  produce  any  evidence 

(medical or otherwise) that, at the time he committed the offenses, his alleged 

mental illnesses caused him to “not know the nature and quality of the act[s]” 

or caused him to “not know that the act[s were] wrong.”  See Smith, 17 A.3d 

at 901; see also N.T. PCRA Hearing, 3/18/22, at 1-18.  Therefore, Appellant 

did not satisfy his burden of production to show that his underlying claim is of 

arguable merit.  Appellant’s claim thus fails. 

Next, Appellant claims that his trial counsel was ineffective “in advising 

Appellant to reject the [Commonwealth’s] negotiated plea” offer.  Appellant’s 

Brief  at  14.    As  the  PCRA  court  thoroughly  explained,  Appellant’s  claim  on 

Appellant’s] underlying claim is that [Trial Counsel] advised 
him  against  accepting  a  plea  agreement  containing  a 
negotiated sentence in favor of entering an open plea which 
would be "capped" at an eight and one-half year minimum. 
[Trial Counsel] testified to the following: 
 

So, if I recall correctly, negotiations had gone on for quite 
a while between myself and the District Attorney's Office. 
Ultimately, I think where things ended up was, there was

an  offer  for  [eight]  and  a  half  to  20.  I  talked  with 
[Appellant] about that, and I explained to him that if he 
plead[ed]  open  there  was  certainly  a  chance  that  he 
would get a lesser sentence, but there was also a chance 
that he would get more than that.  If I remember, I think 
the guidelines started at [six] and a half years.  So he, I 
think, was hoping that if he plead[ed] open, he would get 
something  closer  to  that  bottom  range.    I  don't  recall 
quite frankly whether I advised him one way or the other 
as far as what I think the best option is or what he should 
do.  I explained to him what the options were, and I let 
him decide. 

N.T. PCRA Hearing, 3/18/22, at 6-7.] 

Trial  Counsel]  further  testified  that  he  did  not  recall  ever 
informing [Appellant] that the open plea would be "capped" 
in any way.  [The trial court] ultimately imposed a sentence 
of [15 and one-half to 40 years in prison].  Understandably, 
[Appellant] regrets his decision to refuse the negotiated plea 
agreement.    However,  [the  PCRA  court]  credit[s  Trial 
Counsel’s]  testimony  and  discern[s]  nothing  in  his  counsel 
that fails to adhere to "the range of competence demanded 
of attorneys in criminal cases."  

Appellant] claims he went to court on the day of his guilty 
plea prepared “to take the 8 and a half.” [N.T. PCRA Hearing, 
3/18/22, at 14.  The PCRA court does] not find it credible that 
[Trial  Counsel],  an  experienced  criminal  defense  attorney 
who  has  represented  thousands  of  defendants,  would  have 
talked a client, who was intending to plead guilty, out of doing 
so  by  fabricating  a  plea  agreement.    [The  PCRA  court] 
believe[s] it much more likely that matters transpired exactly 
how  [Trial  Counsel]  explained.    [Appellant]  wanted  a 
sentence better than the offered eight and one-half [] years.  
This inference is supported by [Appellant’s] own testimony, 
where he explained his understanding that the original offer 
was  for  either  seven  []  or  seven  and  one-half  []  years.  
According  to  him,  the  District  Attorney  later  modified  that 
offer  upward  to  eight  and  one-half  [years].    Under  such 
circumstances,  it  seems  entirely  credible  that,  as  [Trial 
Counsel]  testified,  [Appellant]  “was  hoping  that  if  he 
plead[ed]  open,  he  would  get  something  closer  to”  the 
bottom of the standard range of the Sentencing Guidelines.

J-S02016-23 

inding that [Trial Counsel] did not promise [Appellant] the 
sentence would be "capped", and that [Appellant] expressed 
hope  of  obtaining  a  lesser  sentence  than  what  was  being 
offered,  [the  PCRA  court]  find[s  Trial  Counsel’s]  advice 
completely reasonable and legally correct.    [Appellant]  was 
not  promised  a  lesser  sentence.    He  was  offered  the 
opportunity for a lesser sentence through an open plea.  He 
chose  to  pursue  that  opportunity  and  cannot  now  claim 
ineffective  assistance  because 
it  proved  unsuccessful. 
Therefore,  [Appellant’s]  underlying  claim  lacks  arguable 
merit and his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel in this 
regard must fail. 

PCRA Court Opinion, 4/12/22, at 4-6 (some citations omitted). 

The  PCRA  court’s  credibility  determinations  and  factual  findings  are 

supported  by  the  record  and,  thus,  are  binding  on  this  Court.    As  such, 

Appellant’s claim on appeal necessarily fails. 

Order affirmed.  Jurisdiction relinquished.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
