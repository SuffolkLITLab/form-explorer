ILLIAM ROBERT JONES       

v. 

 

 

     

   

    W

 

Appellant 

 No. 1156 MDA 2022 

Appeal from the PCRA Order Entered July 20, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County Criminal Division at 
No(s):  CP-22-CR-0002046-2008 

EFORE:  BOWES, J., OLSON, J., and KUNSELMAN, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY BOWES, J.:              FILED: MARCH 21, 2023 

William  Robert  Jones  appeals  from  the  order  entered  July  20,  2022, 

dismissing his second petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief 

Act (“PCRA”) as untimely.  We affirm. 

On November 17, 2008, Appellant pled nolo contendere to one count of 

possession  of  child  pornography  due  to  his  possession  of  three  images 

depicting nude females under the age of eighteen.  Following a review of the 

no  contest  plea  colloquy  and  a  discussion  of  the  impact  of  sexual  offender 

registration, sentencing was deferred.  Prior to sentencing, Appellant filed and 

then withdrew a motion to withdraw his nolo contendere plea.  On April 10, 

2009, Appellant affirmed that he wished to continue with the plea agreement 

and  was  sentenced  pursuant  to  that  agreement  to  four  years  of  probation.  

Appellant was also required to register for ten years as a sexual offender under 

Megan’s Law III.

J-A09013-23  

J-A09013-23 

Appellant filed a post-sentence motion to withdraw his plea, which was 

denied.    A  timely  direct  appeal  followed  in  which  Appellant  alleged  that  the 

trial court erred when denying his motion to withdraw his plea.  On May 13, 

2010, this Court affirmed Appellant’s judgment of sentence, and Appellant did 

not seek review with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 

 

On  August  30,  2010,  Appellant  filed  a  timely  pro  se  PCRA  petition 

alleging  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.    Appointed  counsel  submitted  an 

amended  PCRA  petition  and  the  court  held  an  evidentiary  hearing  at  which 

Appellant,  his  mother,  his  sister,  plea  counsel,  and  sentencing  counsel 

testified.  Appellant alleged that plea counsel coerced his plea when he told 

him that he was “toast” if he went to trial, that he “wouldn’t last a minute in 

jail,”  and  that  he  was  “too  pretty  to  go  to  jail.”    See  PCRA  Court  Opinion, 

8/31/11, at 2.  The PCRA court found Appellant’s testimony that plea counsel 

coerced him to enter the plea incredible and denied the petition.  On appeal, 

this  Court  affirmed  the  decision  of  the  PCRA  court,  and  the  Pennsylvania 

Supreme Court denied Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.   

 

On March 28, 2022, Appellant filed a petition entitled “Notice of Petition 

and  Petition  for  an  Order  to  Vacate  Judgment,”  which  is  the  subject  of  this 

appeal.  In the petition, Appellant challenged his plea and the legality of his 

sentence.  See PCRA Petition, 3/28/22, at unnumbered 3.   The  PCRA court 

properly  treated  the  filing  as  a  second  pro  se  PCRA  petition.    See 

Commonwealth  v.  Kutnyak,  781  A.2d  1259,  1261  (Pa.Super.  2001) 

(treating  defendant’s  pro  se  motion  challenging  his  guilty  plea  as  a  PCRA 

- 2 - 

J-A09013-23 

petition “regardless of the manner in which the petition is titled” because “the 

PCRA is the exclusive vehicle for obtaining post-conviction collateral relief”).  

The Commonwealth submitted an answer suggesting that Appellant’s petition 

was not cognizable as he was no longer serving any sentence related to this 

case.    See  Answer,  4/28/22,  at  ¶  16.    The  PCRA  court  issued  Pa.R.Crim.P. 

907 notice of its intent to dismiss the petition without a hearing as untimely 

and  lacking  cognizability  since  Appellant  was  no  longer  serving  a  sentence.  

See PCRA Court Opinion, 5/13/22, at 3-4.  Appellant filed his objections and 

on July 20, 2022, the court dismissed his petition.   The PCRA court did not 

order Appellant to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement but did issue a Pa.R.A.P. 

1925(a) opinion.  This appeal followed. 

 

Appellant raises the following two issues for our review:   

 

1.  Whether or not the trial court has jurisdiction to hear a matter 
brought before it by way of fraud upon the court, and in clear 
violation  of  the  constitutionally  protected  rights  of  the 
Appellant.   
 

2.  Whether  or  not  the  trial  court  has  the  authority  to  ignore  its 

ministerial duties. 

Appellant’s brief at unnumbered 4 (unnecessary capitalization omitted). 

We begin with a discussion of the pertinent legal principles.  Our “review 

is limited to the findings of the PCRA court and the evidence of record,” and 

we do not “disturb a PCRA court’s ruling if it is supported by evidence of record 

and is free of legal error.”  Commonwealth v. Diggs, 220 A.3d 1112, 1116 

(Pa.Super.  2019).    Similarly,  “[w]e  grant  great  deference  to  the  factual 

- 3 - 

J-A09013-23 

findings of the PCRA court and will not disturb those findings unless they have 

no support in the record.  However, we afford no such deference to its legal 

conclusions.”    Id.    “[W]here  the  petitioner  raises  questions  of  law,  our 

standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.”  Id.  “It is 

an appellant’s burden to persuade us that the PCRA court erred and that relief 

is due.”  Commonwealth v. Stansbury, 219 A.3d 157, 161 (Pa.Super. 2019) 

(cleaned up).   

Before we may consider the merits of Appellant’s claims, we must first 

determine whether the petition was timely filed.  Pursuant to the PCRA, any 

petition “including a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one 

year  of  the  date  the  judgment  [of  sentence]  becomes  final[.]”    42  Pa.C.S. 

§ 9545(b)(1).    A  judgment  of  sentence  becomes  final  “at  the  conclusion  of 

direct  review,  including  discretionary  review  in  the  Supreme  Court  of  the 

United States and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of 

time for seeking the review.”  42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(b)(3).  The PCRA’s timeliness 

requirements  are  jurisdictional  in  nature,  and  a  court  may  not  address  the 

merits  of  the  issues  raised  if  the  PCRA  petition  was  not  timely  filed.    See 

Commonwealth v. Spotz, 171 A.3d 675, 678 (Pa. 2017). 

The time bar can “only be overcome by satisfaction of one of the three 

statutory exceptions codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).”  Id.  Those 

exceptions are as follows:  “(1) interference by governmental officials in the 

presentation  of  the  claim;  (2)  newly-discovered  facts;  and  (3)  an  after-

recognized constitutional right.”  Commonwealth v. Brandon, 51 A.3d 231, 

- 4 - 

J-A09013-23 

233-34 (Pa.Super. 2012); see also 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1).  Additionally, a 

PCRA petitioner must present his claim within one year of the date the claim 

first could have been presented.  See 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2). 

Appellant’s  petition,  filed  more  than  ten  years  after  his  judgment  of 

sentence became final, is patently untimely.  Thus, unless Appellant pled and 

proved one of the three exceptions to the PCRA time-bar outlined in 42 Pa.C.S. 

§ 9545(b)(1), we cannot address the claims asserted therein.  On review of 

the certified record and his brief on appeal, we find that Appellant has never 

raised the applicability of any of these exceptions.  Accordingly, we hold that 

the PCRA court did not err when it dismissed his petition as being untimely 

filed.1  We affirm the PCRA court’s dismissal of Appellant’s PCRA petition. 

         

____________________________________________ 

1  We also note that, even if timely filed, Appellant is ineligible for PCRA relief.  
The  court  sentenced  Appellant  on  April  10,  2009,  to  serve  four  years  of 
probation.    A  review  of  the  record  reveals  no  subsequent  amendments, 
revocations,  or  alterations  were  made  to  Appellant’s  sentence.    Therefore, 
Appellant’s  sentence  expired  on  April  10,  2013,  nearly  ten  years  before 
Appellant filed the petition at issue in this appeal.  Since Appellant is no longer 
serving the sentence for his convictions in this case, he is ineligible for PCRA 
relief.    See  42  Pa.C.S.  §  9543(a)(1)(i);  see  also  Commonwealth  v. 
Descardes, 136 A.3d 493, 503 (Pa. 2016) (holding petitioner was no longer 
serving  sentence,  so  he  was  ineligible  for  PCRA  relief  and  petitioner’s 
ineligibility deprived the court of jurisdiction to entertain the petition).
