IN THE SUPERIOR COURT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 

No. 826 EDA 2021 

Appeal from the Order Entered November 2, 2020 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County 
Civil Division at No(s): 181003685 

EFORE:  STABILE, J., MCCAFFERY, J. AND PELLEGRINI, J.* 

DISSENTING OPINION BY STABILE, J. 

 

      FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

 

I  respectfully  dissent.    When  a  plaintiff  files  a  complaint  or  writ  of 

summons  on  behalf  of  an  estate  within  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations 

but has not yet been appointed as personal representative to do so, the action 

is considered a legal nullity, unless the plaintiff petitions within the statute of 

limitations for appointment as the personal representative of the estate1 and 

the  appointment  is  substantially  assured.    See  Estate  of  Gasbarini  v. 

Medical Ctr. of Beaver Cnty., 409 A.2d 343 (Pa. 1979); D'Orazio v. Locust 

Lake  Vill.,  Inc.,  406  A.2d  550  (Pa.  Super.  1979);  McGuire  v.  Erie 

____________________________________________

 See 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3153 (prescribing contents of petition for grant of letters

DENIA EDWARDS, PERSONAL 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF 
DOUGLAS A. EDWARDS, 
 
 
 

Appellee 

v. 

 
NORFOLK SOUTHERN RAILWAY 
COMPANY, 
 
 

Appellant 

 

   
     
   
   
   
   

   
   

J-A20039-22 

Lackawanna Ry. Co., 385 A.2d 466 (Pa. Super. 1978).  The failure to both 

file the suit and petition for appointment as personal representative within the 

statute  of  limitations  is  fatal  to  the  action.    In  the  present  case,  Edwards 

fulfilled the first condition by filing a complaint prior to expiration of the statute 

identifying  herself  as  personal  representative  of  her  late  husband’s  estate.  

She  failed,  however,  to  satisfy  the  second  condition  by  neglecting  to  file  a 

petition  for  appointment  as  personal  representative  before  the  statute 

expired.    As  a  result,  the  relation  back  doctrine  does  not  rescue  Edwards’ 

action, and the civil action she filed was a legal nullity.  The trial court erred 

by denying Norfolk Southern’s motion for summary judgment.   

It is well-settled that “a dead man cannot be party to an action, and any 

such attempted proceeding is completely void and of no effect.”  Prevish v. 

Northwest Medical Center Oil City Campus, 692 A.2d 192, 201 (Pa. Super. 

1997) (en banc).  All actions that survive a decedent must be brought by or 

against the personal representative of the estate.  Marzella v. King, 389 A.2d 

659, 660-61 (Pa. Super. 1978).  An action brought  by or against an estate 

lacking a personal representative is void.  Prevish, 692 A.2d at 201.   

In  limited  circumstances,  however,  courts  have  applied  an  exception 

called  the  “relation  back  doctrine”  to  validate  the  acts  of  the  personal 

representative which precede the date of her official appointment.  Relation 

back  applies  when,  before  the  statute  of  limitations  expires,  the  plaintiff 

petitions for appointment as personal representative of the decedent’s estate 

and files an action identifying herself as personal representative.  McGuire, 

- 2 - 

J-A20039-22 

385  A.2d  at  468.    Relation  back  applies  even  though  the  personal 

representative’s  appointment  is  not  finalized,  because  her  timely  petition 

“substantially assure[s]” her appointment as personal representative.  Id.   

Here,  Edwards  filed  a  complaint  within  the  statute  of  limitations 

purporting  to  identify  herself  as  personal  representative,  but  she  failed  to 

petition  for  appointment  as  personal  representative  before  the  statute 

expired.  She waited two months after the statute expired before moving for 

appointment  as  personal  representative.    Nevertheless,  the  majority  insists 

that relation back applies to the present case based on its study of Gasbarini, 

D’Orazio, McGuire, Prevish, and a Commonwealth Court decision, Wilkes-

Barre  Gen.  Hospital  v.  Lesho,  435  A.2d  1340  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  1981).    See 

Majority Op. at 16-23 (discussion section).  I am constrained to disagree with 

the majority’s construction of these decisions. 

In  my  view,  the  majority’s  decision  runs  afoul  of  the  decision  by  our 

Supreme  Court  in  Gasbarini  and  our  own  decisions  in  D’Orazio  and 

McGuire.    In  each  of  these  cases,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  complaint  or  writ  of 

summons within  the statute of  limitations  that identified the plaintiff  as  the 

administrator  of  the  decedent’s  estate.    The  plaintiff  applied  for  letters  of 

administration  before  the  statute  expired,  but  letters  were  not  issued  until 

after the statute expired due to the plaintiff’s failure to post or execute a bond.  

All three decisions held that relation back applied because the plaintiff timely 

initiated the lawsuit and filed for letters before the statute expired. 

- 3 - 

J-A20039-22 

The  Supreme  Court  held  in  Gasbarini  that  relation  back  applied 

because the  plaintiff  timely filed a civil action  and applied for letters within 

the statutory period.  Only because the plaintiff satisfied both factors did the 

Court  decide  that  her  appointment  as  administrator  was  “substantially 

assured” at the time she filed her action.  Id., 409 A.2d at 346.  This Court’s 

earlier  decision  in  McGuire  was  cited  at  length  in  Gasbarini.    Indeed,  our 

Supreme  Court  held  that  “the  instant  case  [Gasbarini]  is  on  all  fours  with 

McGuire  and  .  .  .  [McGuire’s]  reasoning  is  persuasive.”    Id.    D’Orazio  is 

congruent with Gasbarini as well, particularly wherein we stated: 

Although [D’Orazio] was finally granted letters much longer after 
the statute’s running than was Mr. McGuire, this fact does not alter 
our disposition.  The crucial factors are that letters had been 
requested and the action commenced within the statutory 
period, and appellant’s appointment as administratrix, under the 
circumstances of this case, “was substantially assured at the time 
the  complaint  was  filed,  ...  within  the  statutory  period  of 
limitations. 

Id., 406 A.2d at 552 (emphasis added).2 

Under Gasbarini, McGuire, and D’Orazio, relation back does not apply 

due  to  Edwards’  failure  to  satisfy  the  “crucial”  requisite  of  petitioning  for 

appointment  as  personal  representative  during  the  limitations  period.    The 

majority attempts to downplay the “crucial factors” passage by stating: 

In  [D’Orazio],  the  plaintiff  mother  did  not  obtain  the  letters  of 
administration until about a year-and-a-half after the statute had 
run,  which  was  substantially  longer  than  the  delay  in  McGuire. 

____________________________________________ 

2  I  refer  to  this  passage  below  as  the  “crucial  factors  passage”  or  “the 
passage.” 

- 4 - 

Thus, read in context, the D’Orazio court’s statement that it was 
“crucial”  that  the  plaintiff  request  the  letters  before  the  statute 
had run was meant to answer the concern that the plaintiff mother 
was not granted the letters until “much longer after the statute’s 
running than [the plaintiff in McGuire.]” 

ajority Op. at 21.  This passage does more than address the concern that 

  M

the  plaintiff  was  not  granted  letters  until  much  later  than  the  plaintiff  in 

McGuire.  It demonstrates what is and what is not “crucial” for the relation 

back  doctrine  to  apply.    It  teaches  that  relation  back  does  not  depend  on 

whether  letters  are  granted  immediately  after  the  statute  expires  or 

substantially after the statute expires.  Instead, the only factors that matter 

for relation back—the “crucial factors”—are whether the plaintiff commences 

the action before the statute and requests letters before the statute expires.  

If the plaintiff satisfies both factors, as the plaintiff did in  D’Orazio (and in 

Gasbarini and McGuire), relation  back applies.   If the plaintiff fails one  of 

these  factors,  as  Edwards  did  here,  or  both  factors,  relation  back  does  not 

apply.   

 

The majority also relies heavily on Lesho, which held that relation back 

applied  even  though  the  personal  representative  failed  to  petition  for 

appointment as personal representative prior to the statute of limitations.  As 

a Commonwealth Court opinion, Lesho is not binding on this Court but is at 

most persuasive authority, a point the majority concedes.  Majority Op. at 21 

n.7.  In my view, Lesho reached the right result but for the wrong reason.  

The reason given flies in the face of Gasbarini, McGuire and D’Orazio.      

J-A20039-22 

- 5 - 

In Lesho, a wrongful death action, two months after the decedent died, 

her  parents filed a petition in the Orphans' Court to settle  her  estate under 

Section  3102  of  the  Probate,  Estates  and  Fiduciaries  Code,  20  Pa.C.S.A.  § 

3102.  The petition was granted.   Subsequently,  the plaintiffs filed a timely 

complaint in the Arbitration Panels for Health Care identifying themselves as 

administrators of the decedent’s estate.  The plaintiffs neither applied for nor 

were granted letters of administration until after the statute of limitations had 

run.  Nevertheless, the Commonwealth Court held that relation back applied, 

Absolutely  nothing  was  changed  in  the  [plaintiffs’]  complaint  by 
virtue  of  letters  of  administration  having  been  granted  to  them 
after the statute of limitations had run.  From the time the original 
complaint was filed, the [defendants] were aware that they were 
being sued for their alleged negligence resulting in the death of a 
named decedent.  Every element necessary to establish the two 
causes  of  action  against  the  [defendants]  was  set  forth  in  the 
complaint,  including  the  erroneous  fact  that  the  [plaintiffs]  had 
been appointed administrators of their daughter’s estate. 

d., 435 A.2d at 1343.  This passage is unpersuasive because it conflicts with 

  I

Gasbarini,  McGuire  and  D’Orazio,  which  all  drive  home  that  the 

appointment  of  the  personal  representative—and  his  right  to  prosecute  an 

action on behalf of the estate—is not substantially assured unless she petitions 

for appointment as  personal representative  before the statute of limitations 

expires.  When the plaintiff fails to take this step before the statute expires, 

there is no guarantee that she will ever take this step.  The majority endorses 

Lesho’s passage, reasoning that relation back applies when the plaintiff fails 

stating: 

J-A20039-22

J-A20039-22 

to petition for letters during the limitation period so long as the defendant is 

notified of the action before the statute expires.  Majority Op. at 15, 22-23.  

The majority goes on to say that Edwards placed Norfolk Southern on notice 

of her action, and satisfied the relation back doctrine, by filing the complaint 

during  the  limitation  period.    Under  Gasbarini,  McGuire  and  D’Orazio, 

however, it is entirely irrelevant whether the defendant is notified of the action 

during the limitation period.  The focus of these decisions is what the plaintiff 

does,  not  what  the  defendant  learns,  before  the  statute  expires.    Since 

Edwards failed to petition for letters before the statute expired, her action is 

a  legal  nullity,  regardless  of  whether  Norfolk  Southern  was  notified  of  the 

action during the limitation period. 

In my view, a better reason existed for applying relation back in Lesho.  

Long  before  the  statute  expired  in  Lesho,  the  decedent’s  parents  filed  a 

petition  in  the  Orphans'  Court  to  settle  their  daughter's  estate  under  20 

Pa.C.S.A.  §  3102,  which  petition  was  granted.    Section  3102,  pertaining  to 

small  estates,  provides  in  part  that  when  any  person  dies  domiciled  in  the 

Commonwealth  owning  property  of  a  gross  value  not  exceeding  $50,000 

(excluding certain real estate and other payments), upon petition of any party 

in  interest,  the  court  has  the  discretion,  whether  or  not  letters  have  been 

issued or a will probated, to direct distribution of the property to the entitled 

parties. The decree of distribution constitutes sufficient authority to the world 

that  the  persons  named  therein  are  entitled  to  distribution  without 

- 7 - 

J-A20039-22 

administration, and it has the same effect as a decree of distribution after an 

accounting  by  a  personal  representative.    Essentially,  Section  3102  treats 

successful  petitioners  as  having  received  letters  of  administration  without 

formally applying for them.  Thus, in Lesho, I believe the better reason for 

applying relation back was because the decedent’s parents petitioned for their 

daughter’s small estate distribution before the statute of limitations expired.  

This rationale is consistent with Gasbarini, McGuire and D’Orazio, because 

like the plaintiffs in these cases, the decedent’s parents took sufficient action 

before the statute of limitations to substantially assure that an estate would 

be raised.  Lesho itself suggests this rationale in dicta wherein it was stated, 

“[i]t is possible that the [parents] really thought they were the administrators 

of their daughter’s estate because of their previous petition and proceeding 

before the Orphans’ Court. . .”   Id. at 1343. 

The  last case relied upon  by  the majority, Prevish,  does  not address 

the  issue  presently  before  us.    There,  several  days  before  the  statute  of 

limitations  expired,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  writ  of  summons  that  identified  the 

plaintiff as “Estate of Judith A. Bills, Deceased.”  The writ failed to identify the 

plaintiff as the executor of the estate.  As such, the writ was a nullity, because 

actions  cannot  be  brought  by  dead  men  or  by  estates  lacking  a  personal 

representative.  Id., 692 A.2d at 201.  After the statute expired, the plaintiff 

filed a complaint identifying himself as the executor of the estate.  The record 

was “unclear” as to when the plaintiff applied for letters testamentary or when 

- 8 - 

J-A20039-22 

they were issued.  Id. at 205 n.2 (Schiller, J., concurring).3  The Court held 

that relation back did not apply because the only document filed before the 

statute expired, the writ of summons, was a nullity that failed to identify the 

executor  or  notify  the  defendants  that  there  was,  even  potentially,  an 

executor.    Id.  at  204.    This  omission  created  “the  sort  of  instability  that 

statutes of limitation seek to preclude.”  Id. at 205. 

 

The issue in Prevish is different than the issue in the present case.  The 

issue  before  us  is  whether  relation  back  applies  due  to  Edwards’  failure  to 

apply  for  appointment  as  personal  representative  within  the  statute  of 

limitations.    The  issue  in  Prevish  was  whether  relation  back  applied  under 

different circumstances, namely when a timely filed writ of summons failed to 

identify the plaintiff as personal representative of the estate.  All that Prevish 

said  about  the  issue  before  us  was  that  the  record  was  “unclear”  when  the 

plaintiff moved for letters testamentary.   Id. at 205 n.2.  Because Prevish 

does not speak to the issue that concerns us, I believe the majority’s reliance 

upon Prevish is misplaced. 

 

None of the cases relied upon by the majority support the application of 

relation back to this action.  Edwards was not the personal representative of 

the estate at the time she filed this action, and she failed to cure this defect 

by filing a petition within the statute of limitations for appointment as personal 

____________________________________________ 

3 The majority opinion in Prevish was silent on when the plaintiff applied for 
or obtained letters.

J-A20039-22 

representative.  Thus, her action is a legal nullity and is not rescued by the 

relation  back  doctrine.    Relation  back  does  not  cure  the  lack  of  a  personal 

representative—the defect that otherwise renders the action a nullity—unless 

the plaintiff takes a sufficient step during the limitations period to ensure that 

an estate is raised.  When, as here, the plaintiff fails to take any step to raise 

an estate until after the statute of limitation expires, relation back cannot be 

used to breathe life back into the plaintiff’s lawsuit.   

Since relation back doctrine does not apply to this case, the trial court 

should have granted summary judgment to Norfolk Southern.  I respectfully 

submit  that  the  proper  course  of  action  is  to  reverse  the  trial  court’s  order 

denying summary judgment to Norfolk Southern and remand with instructions 

to enter summary judgment in its favor.
