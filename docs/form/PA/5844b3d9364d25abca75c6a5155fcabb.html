MEMORANDUM BY SULLIVAN, J.: 

 

 

      FILED MARCH 17, 2023 

The Commonwealth appeals from the order granting the Post-Conviction 

Relief Act1 (“PCRA”) petition of Lekirr Brown (“Brown”).  We reverse. 

The PCRA court provided the factual and procedural history, which we 

set forth in relevant part as follows:

In the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County

 No. 265 EDA 2022 

[In the early hours of the morning in November 2011, Brown 
shot  his  victim  Zandar  Cotton  in  the  stomach  outside  of  a  bar.  
See  generally  Commonwealth  v.  Brown,  258  A.3d  539  (Pa. 
Super.  2021)  (unpublished  memorandum  at  *1).]    [I]n  July  [] 
2012,  [following] a bench  trial,  [Brown] was found guilty of the 
following  charges:  attempted  murder,  aggravated  assault, 
possession of a firearm prohibited . . ., carrying firearms in public 
in Philadelphia . . ., and possession of an instrument of crime . . ..  
[Brown] was found not guilty of firearms not to be carried without 
a license . . ..  [I]n December [] 2012, the [trial court] . . . imposed 
.  .  .  [an]  aggregate  sentence  [of]  ten  to  twenty  years  [of 
incarceration].

[I]n February [] 2013, [Brown] filed his first PCRA petition 
and then an amended PCRA petition [i]n March [] 2013, wherein 
he  claimed  that  his  trial  counsel  was  ineffective  because  he  did 
not timely petition the [trial c]ourt to appoint counsel for appeal. 
[Following reinstatement of Brown’s direct appeal rights nunc pro 
tunc,]  the  Superior  Court  affirmed  [Brown’s]  judgment  of 
sentence  [i]n  June  []  2014.    [Brown]  filed  a  [p]etition  for 
[a]llowance of [a]ppeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania [i]n 
June[] 2014[,] and his petition was denied on October 7, 2014. 

[Brown  timely  filed  his  second  PCRA  petition.]  .  .  .[O]n 
March  2,  2018,  th[e  PCRA  c]ourt  issued  an  order  denying  .  .  .  
post[-]conviction relief. 

[Brown appealed to the Superior Court[,] which dismissed 
the appeal in April 2019, based on substantial defects in Brown’s 
brief.]  [Brown] filed his [third petition seeking reinstatement of 
his  right  to  appeal  nunc  pro  tunc  the  dismissal  of  his  second 
petition.  By agreement of the parties,] . . .  [t]he PCRA Court . . . 
reinstated [Brown’s] right to file an appeal of the dismissal of his 
second PCRA petition[] nunc pro tunc. 

I]n June [] 2020, [Brown] filed a [n]otice of [a]ppeal of the 

dismissal of his [second] PCRA petition.  

On  June  21,  2021,  the  Superior  Court  vacated  the  PCRA 
[c]ourt’s  March  2,  2018  order  in  part,  affirmed  it  in  part,  and 
remanded for an evidentiary hearing . . . on the newly raised issue 
of whether [Brown’s] trial counsel failed to notify [him] of a plea 
deal  offered  by  the  prosecution.    The  Superior  Court  found  that 
[Brown’s] first two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel had 
no merit. . ..  [See Brown, 258 A.3d 539.] 

In his PCRA [p]etition, [Brown] argued that trial counsel . . .

the  prosecution.    A  docket  entry  dated  April  2,  2012,  states 
“Commonwealth’s  Offer  Rejected.”    At  a[  PCRA]  evidentiary 
hearing, held on November[] 2, 2021, [Brown] contended that he 
was never informed of any offer: 

 

PCRA Counsel:  

Were  you  ever  presented  by  [trial 
counsel] with any guilty plea offer? 

Brown]: 

No, I was never informed by him. 

CRA Counsel:  

Did  you  ever  ask  him  for  a  guilty  plea 
offer? 

Brown]:  

Yes, I did. 

CRA Counsel:  

And  what  did  [trial  counsel]  state  to 
you? 

Brown]:  

He  said  it  was—it  wasn’t—nothing  was 
offered. He’s going to handle it. 

* * * * 

Commonwealth]:   So you agree that you reached a deal in 
the drug case, but you did not have any 
deal  conveyed  to  you  on  the—on  the 
attempted  murder  case,  is  that  your 
testimony today? 

Brown]: 

Yes, that’s my testimony. He said there 
wasn’t any offers. 

The PCRA Court concluded, and both counsel for [Brown] as 
well as for the Commonwealth agreed, that the transcripts from 
April 2, 2012 were inconclusive with regard[] to the details of a 
plea deal: 
 

[PCRA Court]: 

We  also  don’t  have  any  sort  of  record 
from the plea date or what would have 
been the plea date as to what the offer 
was  extended,  if  that  offer  was  in  fact 
conveyed  to  .  .  .  Brown,  and  if  it  was

it from the written transcripts, the crier 
in the room essentially saying offer was 
rejected,  and  giving  it  a  trial  date.    Is 
that accurate, [c]ounsel? 

CRA Counsel: 

Yes, Your Honor.

The Commonwealth represent[ed] that it looked extensively 
through  its  files  and  has  no  record  of  the  specifics  of  the  offer 
made to [Brown’s] trial counsel.  The Commonwealth indicate[ed] 
that  it  has  “no  doubt”  an  offer  was  extended  because  of  the 
markings on  its case file and the notation on  [Brown’s] criminal 
docket  from  April  2,  2012.    The  Commonwealth  contacted 
associates of [trial counsel] and the widow of . . . [Brown’s] initial 
PCRA [c]ounsel, for the purpose of locating [Brown’s] trial records.  
These  attempts  were  unsuccessful.    Both  [trial  counsel]  and 
[initial PCRA counsel] are deceased.  [See id.] at 34-38.

T]he  PCRA  Court,  [by]  order  dated  January  10,  2022, 
granted the PCRA petition, but did not vacate [Brown’s] sentence 
at that time.  The PCRA Court determined that trial counsel was 
ineffective but held the issue of a remedy under advisement.  On 
January 18, 2022, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal to 
th[is] . . . Court.  On January 24, 2022, the PCRA Court ordered 
[the  Commonwealth]  to  file  a  [c]oncise  [s]tatement  of  [e]rrors

PCRA  Court  Opinion,  3/24/22,  at  1-6,  8-9  (unnecessarily  capitalization  and 

some  internal  citations  to  the  record  omitted;  paragraphs  re-ordered  for 

clarity; bullet points added). 

The Commonwealth raises the following issue for our review: 

Did  the  lower  court  err  in  granting  PCRA  relief  based  on 
counsel’s  purported  failure  to  convey  a  plea  offer,  where 
[Brown]  never  proved  what  the  offer  was  and  thus  failed  to 
demonstrate that he was prejudiced, i.e., that the offer was for 
a  sentence  that  was  less  than  the  relatively  lenient  one  [he] 
actually received? 

ommonwealth’s Brief at 4. 

The  standard  of  review  for  an  order  granting  a  PCRA  petition  is  well-

When  reviewing  an  order  granting  PCRA  relief,  we  must 
determine whether the decision of the PCRA court is supported by 
the evidence of record and is free of legal error.  Moreover, we will 
not  disturb  the  findings  of  the  PCRA  court  unless  those  findings 
have no support in the certified record. 

ommonwealth v. Rivera, 154 A.3d 370, 377 (Pa. Super. 2017) (internal 

citations and quotations omitted).  This Court analyzes PCRA appeals “in the 

light  most 

favorable  to  the  prevailing  party  at  the  PCRA 

level.”  

Commonwealth v. Steckley, 128 A.3d 826, 831 (Pa. Super. 2015) (internal 

citation and quotations omitted). 

In  its  sole  appellate  issue,  the  Commonwealth  argues  the  trial  court 

erred  in  concluding  that  Brown  had  established  prejudice  based  on  trial 

counsel’s ineffective assistance in the form of an alleged failure to convey to 

Brown a plea offer.  See Commonwealth’s Brief at 17.  Generally speaking,

J-A03018-23 

PCRA claims are not merely direct appeal claims that are made at 
a later stage of the proceedings, cloaked in a boilerplate assertion 
of counsel’s ineffectiveness.   In essence, they are extraordinary 
assertions  that  the  system  broke  down.    To  establish  claims  of 
constitutional  error  or  ineffectiveness  of  counsel,  the  petitioner 
must  plead  and  prove  by  a  preponderance  of  evidence  that  the 
system  failed  (i.e.,  for  an  ineffectiveness  or  constitutional  error 
claim,  that  in  the  circumstances  of  his  case,  including  the  facts 
established  at  trial,  guilt  or  innocence  could  not  have  been 
adjudicated  reliably),  that  his  claim  has  not  been  previously 
litigated or waived, and where a claim was not raised at an earlier 
stage  of  the  proceedings,  that  counsel  could  not  have  had  a 
rational  strategic  or  tactical  reason  for  failing  to  litigate  these 
claims earlier. 
 

Commonwealth  v.  Chazin,  873  A.2d  732,  734  (Pa.  Super.  2005).    For 

ineffective  assistance of counsel claims, a  petitioner must  plead and prove: 

(1)  his  underlying  claim  is  of  arguable  merit;  (2)  counsel  lacked  any 

reasonable basis for the act or omission alleged; and (3) that the petitioner 

was prejudiced as a result, that is, there is a reasonable probability that, but 

for the act or omission challenged, the outcome of the proceeding would have 

been  different.    See  id.  at  735.    Furthermore,    “[o]rdinarily,  a  claim  of 

ineffectiveness may be denied by a showing that the petitioner’s evidence fails 

to meet a single one of these prongs.”  Id. (internal citation and quotations 

omitted).   

More  specifically,  when  a  petitioner  alleges  ineffective  assistance  of 

counsel for failure to convey a plea offer, the petitioner must satisfy a four-

part test:  (1) an offer for a plea was made; (2) trial counsel failed to inform 

him of such offer; (3) trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to inform 

him of the plea offer; and (4) he was prejudiced thereby.  See id.  A showing 

- 6 - 

J-A03018-23 

of  prejudice  requires  some  evidence  that  “the  result  of  the  plea  bargain 

process  would  have  been  different  had  he  been  able  to  accept 

the Commonwealth’s . . . offer.”  Id. at 737.2 

The  Commonwealth  argues  the  PCRA  court  erred  in  granting  Brown’s 

petition for relief based on his attorney’s failure to convey a plea offer because 

Brown  failed  to  establish  prejudice.    The  Commonwealth  concedes  that  an 

offer was made, but maintains “there is no record of what that offer was and 

[Brown] has not proffered such evidence.”  Commonwealth’s Brief at 17.  The 

Commonwealth argues that, given Brown’s sentence was already at the low 

end of the standard range—and much less than the twenty-five-year minimum 

which  the  Commonwealth  had  sought  at  the  sentencing  hearing—it  was 

unlikely  that  its  plea  offer  had  been  lower  than  the  actual  sentence  Brown 

received following his conviction at trial.  See id. 

Notably, Brown also concedes that there is no evidence as to what the 

extended offer had been; however, he argues it was “likely that the plea offer 

____________________________________________ 

2 Steckley similarly provides that a PCRA petitioner must show that, 
 

[b]ut for the ineffective advice of counsel[,] there is a reasonable 
probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the 
court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted the plea and 
the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening 
circumstances), that the court would have accepted its terms, and 
that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer’s terms 
would  have  been  less  severe  than  under  the  judgment  and 
sentence that in fact were imposed.

would have been less than the [ten-to-twenty-year] sentence he was given.”  

Brown’s Brief at 14.3  Accordingly, he maintains the PCRA court properly found 

trial  counsel  was  ineffective,  and  that  the  PCRA  court  was  empowered  to 

fashion a remedy, even though the terms of the plea offer are unknown. 

The  PCRA  court  ultimately  granted  Brown’s  PCRA  petition  by  order  of 

January  10,  2022.    See  Order,  1/10/22.    However,  the  court  has  since 

reconsidered its conclusion: “Contrary to this [c]ourt’s  initial determination, 

[Brown’s] claim that trial counsel was ineffective cannot prevail.”  PCRA Court 

Opinion, 3/24/22, at 1.  The PCRA court explained: 

Initially,  th[e  PCRA  c]ourt  determined  that  [Brown’s]  trial 
counsel  was  ineffective,  however,  after  careful  review  of  the 
record, [Brown] cannot prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance 
of  counsel  because  he  cannot  show  that  he  was  prejudiced  by 
[trial counsel’s] failure to communicate a plea deal.  The notes of 
testimony[,] from the date when [Brown’s] docket stated that the 

____________________________________________ 

3 Brown cites a New Hampshire case for the proposition  that the trial court 
has  discretion  to  fashion  an  appropriate  remedy  when  it  finds  a  defendant 
received  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  during  plea  negotiations.    See 
Brown’s Brief at 15 (citing State v. Fitzgerald, 243 A.3d 1206 (N.H. 2020)).  
Notably,  in  Fitzgerald,  the  terms  of  the  State’s  plea  offer  were  known,  so 
that  case  is  distinguishable.    That  case  also  involved  a  sentencing 
enhancement that counsel failed to adequately discuss with his client during 
plea negotiations.  See, e.g., id. at 1217.  Brown also cites Commonwealth 
v. Bradshaw, 249 A.3d 1148 (Pa. Super. 2021) (unpublished memorandum); 
however,  in  that  case,  this  Court  merely  reversed  and  remanded  for 
supplemental  evidentiary  hearings  concerning  allegations  of  trial  counsel’s 
ineffectiveness for failure to convey a plea offer.  Contra Brown’s Brief at 16.  
Brown also cites Commonwealth v. Kruge, 249 A.3d 1164 (Pa. Super. 2021) 
(unpublished memorandum), but that case involved a known plea offer, and 
the  parties  agreed  that  counsel  failed  to  inform  his  client  during  plea 
negotiations  about  a  mandatory  minimum  that  would  be  triggered  on 
conviction at the conclusion of the trial.  Contra Brown’s Brief at 16.  All cases 
offered by Brown are distinguishable and non-precedential in this court.

plea  offer  was  rejected[,]  are  inconclusive  as  to  the  specifics  of 
the plea deal.  The District Attorney’s Office has no record of the 
details of the plea offer that was conveyed to [trial counsel].  Both 
[Brown’s] trial counsel and his initial PCRA counsel are deceased, 
and their records cannot be located. [Brown] himself testified that 
he  was  never  told  that  a  plea  deal  existed.    To  say  that 
[Brown’s]  sentence  would  have  been  less  severe  if  [trial 
counsel] had communicated the plea deal would be purely 
speculative  and  not  based 
  Because  of 
this . . .[, Brown] cannot show that he was prejudiced and cannot

fact. 

in 

PCRA Court Opinion, 3/24/22, at 9 (emphasis added). 

Following our review, we conclude that the PCRA court’s grant of relief 

was premised on speculation unsupported by evidence of record.  At the PCRA 

stage of  litigation,  it is the petitioner’s burden  to plead and prove his  case.  

See, e.g., Chazin, 873 A.2d at 734.  Thus, it was Brown’s burden to prove 

that  a  plea  offer  existed,  the  terms  of  which  were  more  favorable  than  the 

sentence  actually  received,  and  that,  there  is  a  reasonable  probability  that, 

had he been presented with that offer, he would have accepted it.  See id. at 

735; see also Steckley, 128 A.3d at 832.  Brown failed to carry his burden 

of proving that an offer existed that was more favorable than the sentence he 

received, because he could not establish the terms of the offer.   Further, to 

conclude  Brown  would  have  accepted  the  offer  would  require  speculation 

about the terms of the offer, given there is no basis in the record to support 

this conclusion.  Accordingly, we reverse the PCRA court’s order granting PCRA 

relief. 

Order reversed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
