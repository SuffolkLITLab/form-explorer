SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE OF THE PRESIDENT JUDGE 
OF THE 31ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT (LEHIGH COUNTY) 
TO THE COURT’S ORDER OF APRIL 3, 2020 

The  COVID-19  pandemic  reached  Pennsylvania  in  March,  2020  and  the  Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”) issued a series of judicial emergency orders on March 16, March 
18, March 24, April 1, and April 28, 2020. Among other things, these orders suspended jury trials; 
suspended the time limits for commencement of trials under Rule of Criminal Procedure 600(C) 
(Prompt  Trial  Rule);  closed  all  courts  of  Pennsylvania  to  the  public  except  for  certain  essential 
functions; and directed the President Judge of each judicial district to fashion emergency judicial 
orders  to  address  their  particular  circumstances.  The  orders  eventually  directed  that  the  Courts 
should use advanced communication technology to conduct Court proceedings whenever possible. 
The April 28, 2020 order directed Pennsylvania courts to re-open beginning May 4, 2020 to conduct 
business, but with limitations on types of proceedings and in-person access. On May 27, 2020, the 
Supreme  Court  entered  its  final  such  order  which,  among  other  things,  terminated  the  previous 
emergency orders as of June 1, 2020 and empowered each President Judge to declare an emergency 
within their own district and continue to exercise emergency powers. These Supreme Court orders 
can be found at http://www.pacourts.us/ujs-coronavirus-information. 

n April 3, 2020, the Supreme Court decided the within case by denying a petition asking 
the Supreme Court “to direct the President Judges of the Commonwealth to order, inter alia, the 
immediate presumptive release of specified categories of incarcerated persons to prevent the spread 
of COVID-19  in county correctional institutions.”    The  April  3,  2020  order further directed the 
President Judges of each judicial district to:

…coordinate  with  relevant  county  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  the  county 
correctional institutions in their districts address the threat of COVID-19, applying 
the  recommendations  of  public  health  officials,  including  the  CDC’s  Interim 
in 
Guidance  on  Management  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19) 
Correctional and detention Facilities (Mar. 23, 2020). If utilization of public health 
best  practices  is  not  feasible  due  to  the  population  of  the  county  correctional 
institutions,  President Judges  should consult with  relevant  county stakeholders to 
identify individuals and/or classes of incarcerated persons for potential release or 
transfer to reduce the current and future populations of the institutions during this 
health crisis with careful regard for the safety of victims and their communities in 
general, with awareness of the statutory rights of victims and with due consideration 
given to public health concerns related to inmates who may have contracted COVID-
19. Moreover, consistent with these above considerations, President Judges are to 
undertake  efforts  to  limit  the  introduction  of  new  inmates  into  the  county  prison 
system.

n April 9, 2020, then President Judge Edward D. Reibman of the Court Of Common Pleas 
Of  Lehigh  County  (“this  Court”)  filed  a  written  response  entitled  “Response  of  Edward  D. 
Reibman,  President  Judge  of  the  31st  Judicial  District  (Lehigh  County),  to  the  Court’s  Order  of 
April  3,  2020”  (“Response”).  That  Response  outlined  the  changes  this  Court  and  many  other 
institutions, departments and offices including, but not limited to, the Magisterial District Courts; 
the Lehigh County Office of the District Attorney; the Lehigh County Public Defender’s Office; 
Lehigh Valley Pretrial Services; the Lehigh County Adult Probation and Parole Department; the 
Lehigh County Department of Corrections and the Lehigh County Department of Human Services; 
conflicts attorneys appointed by the Court; and private criminal defense attorneys (“Stakeholders”) 
implemented in accordance with the April 3, 2020 order. For the Supreme Court’s easy reference, 
that Response is attached hereto as “Attachment A.”   
 

In addition, beginning in March, 2020, and continuing to the present, this Court has issued 
a  series  of  judicial  emergency  orders  effective  in  Lehigh  County  to  address  the  multitude  of 
considerations  involved  in  continuing  to  operate  this  Court  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic 
including, but not limited to, the need to serve members of the public who seek legal redress through 
this Court; the need to protect the parties, the public and courthouse employees from COVID-19; 
and the need to protect the legal rights of all parties involved in all legal matters filed with this 
Court.  These  local  judicial  emergency  orders  can  be  found  on  this  Court’s  website  at 
https://www.lccpa.org/Covid19.

This  supplemental  response  is  filed  to  provide  an  updated  summary  of  the  actions 
undertaken by this Court and the Stakeholders in response to the directives of the Supreme Court 
set forth above related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes the methods by which by this Court 
and the Stakeholders have undertaken to  limit the number of defendants  who come through the 
Lehigh County justice system (“Lehigh County Defendants”) in LCJ both prior to, and pursuant to, 
the April 3, 2020 order; provides data regarding trends in new criminal cases and incarceration rates 
over  the  last  six  years;  provides  a  random  representative  sample  of  the  composition  of  Lehigh 
County Defendants in Lehigh County Jail (“LCJ”) and their respective criminal offenses; offers 
information regarding the setting of bail; and identifies areas where increased community resources 
could supplement the work of the Court and other Stakeholders in this area.    
 

This Court and the Stakeholders are acutely aware that incarceration is to be utilized in the 
justice  system  when  appropriate  to  protect  victims  and  the  community  at  large  from  dangerous 
individuals  and  to  deter  individuals  from  committing  future  crimes  and  to  ensure  a  defendant’s 
appearance at future court proceedings.  

trategies Employed By The Court And Stakeholders  

one of us want people in jail who do not need to be there. That accomplishes nothing. The 
people who work in the criminal justice system in Lehigh County are acutely aware that justice 
does not just happen and that, as a human invention, it must be created. To do that, all involved 
must operate from a philosophy of respect for all of humanity and work very hard every day to 
ensure that everyone – defendants, victims, and the public – are treated fairly under the rule of law. 
In accordance with that philosophy, and well before March, 2020, this Court and the Stakeholders 
developed,  and/or  identified  and  utilized  many  innovative  non-incarceration  interventions  and 
community resources to appropriately limit the number of Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ. A 
list of some of those interventions and resources is attached as “Attachment B.”   

ince the COVID-19 pandemic began, in addition to the actions set forth in Attachment A 
and  Attachment  B,  this  Court  and  the  Stakeholders  have  also  been  enhancing  those  efforts  by, 
among other things: 
 

1.  Reducing criminal charges where appropriate. 

.  Re-examining the setting of bail and conditions that might allow for the release of a 
Lehigh  County  Defendant  in  accordance  with  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Criminal 
Procedure to ensure reasonable and realistic bail based on static and non-discriminatory 
factors.

4.  Conducting many court proceedings by advanced communication technology such as

infection.  

.  Regularly reviewing the Lehigh County Defendant population in LCJ for the possibility 

of early parole, bail reductions and/or working out plea agreements. 

Increasing funding to subsidize electronic monitoring costs for repeat Driving While 
Under the Influence of Alcohol or Controlled Substance offenders, allowing them to 
choose electronic monitoring over jail without incurring the electronic monitoring cost 
of $14.00 per day.

.  Reducing the “Good Time” policy from 1 day off of a minimum sentence for every 6 

days misconduct-free to 1 day off for every 4 days misconduct-free. 

 
 
Furthermore,  it  is  this  Court’s  understanding  that  the  Lehigh  County  Department  of 
Corrections (“DOC”) has instituted measures to prepare, respond and ultimately recover from the 
COVID-19 Pandemic that are in accordance with Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) guidelines, 
the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Health,  and  the  Pandemic  Plan  followed  by  the  contracted 
healthcare  provider,  and  derived  from  ongoing  communication  and  collaboration  with  other 
correctional facilities within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  These measures have been taken 
at LCJ and the Community Corrections Center (“CCC’), a work release facility operated by the 
DOC. The following is a general statement of what this Court understands to be those measures: 
 

1.  The evaluation of chemicals and cleaning supplies to ensure effectiveness in quelling 
the virus began in late February, 2020.  Enhanced sanitation protocols were instituted 
throughout  the  departments,  with  particular  attention  to  commonly  used  areas  and 
surfaces.  All staff and inmates were provided instructions regarding the importance of 
proper hygiene; frequent and thorough hand-washing; vigilance in maintaining social 
distance whenever possible; and the importance of keeping surfaces clean.  On March 
13,  2020,  access  to  LCJ  and  the  CCC  by  non-essential  visitors  and  volunteers  was 
suspended.  Beginning  on  April 3,  2020, residents  of  the  CCC  were  prohibited from 
leaving that facility to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  

2.  The contracted healthcare provider added COVID-19 screening questions for all new 
commitments.    Both  staff  and  inmates  are  screened  for  symptoms  and  are  subject  to 
temperature  checks  prior  to  entering  the  facility.  All  newly  incarcerated  inmates  are 
required  to  quarantine  for  a  minimum  of  14  days.    As  of  December,  2020,  all  new 
commitments are tested using an Abbot Rapid COVID Antigen test. Inmates who test 
negative are tested again at the end of their quarantine period.  Mass testing of the entire 
LCJ  population  was  conducted  in  December  and  regular  surveillance  testing  of  the 
population is on-going. 

4 

 

       

 

3.  Collaborative efforts of the Stakeholders to release those inmates deemed appropriate 
began in in mid-March, 2020 and included review of the cases of inmates identified as 
medically  vulnerable  by  the  DOC’s  contracted  healthcare  provider,  to  identify  and 
implement  alternatives  to  incarceration  or  discharge  where  suitable.  The  population 
review process is on-going. 

4.  Use  of  appropriate  personal  protective  equipment  that  was  provided  to  all  staff  and 
inmates  was  made  mandatory,  all  meals  are  served  to  inmates  in  their  cells,  and  the 
number  of  inmates  permitted  out  of  their  cells  contemporaneously  was  reduced  to 
promote social distancing.   

.  As part of the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s COVID-19 vaccination plan, the 
DOC is working with its contracted healthcare provider to establish a plan to vaccinate 
both staff and inmates at such time as doses of vaccine become available. 

As 2020 proceeded, this Court attempted to resume jury trials by employing extensive safety 
measures to protect all participants from COVID-19, while at the same time protecting the statutory 
rights of victims and the constitutional rights of defendants. However, when the spread of COVID-
19  in  Pennsylvania  and  Lehigh  County  increased  in  the  Fall  of  2020,  this  Court  was  again 
constrained to suspend jury trials in order to avoid the risk of spreading COVID-19. Currently, jury 
trials are suspended through April 2, 2021 and this Court will continue to regularly evaluate the 
evolving circumstances relative to the COVID-19 pandemic and determine the optimum date for 
resumption of jury trials.    

rends Over The Past Six Years 

otwithstanding  the  constraints  caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  this  Court  and  the 
Stakeholders have been effective in limiting the inmate population of Lehigh County defendants in 
LCJ throughout 2020 to the present. In order to understand where we are now, it is useful to first 
understand where we have been in the past. To provide that perspective, we offer the following 
data. It is important to note that this data relates only to Lehigh County Defendants, defendants who 
come  through  the  Lehigh  County  justice  system;  it  does  not  include  federal,  state,  or  other 
jurisdiction defendants - inmates over whom this Court has no jurisdiction. 
 

1.  Lehigh County has a population of approximately 370,000 people, approximately 121,000 
of whom are citizens of the City of Allentown, the third largest city in Pennsylvania.   
See: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/.   
 

2.  LCJ has a total bed capacity of 1,363 (1,267 operational, 96 emergency).

hese charts demonstrate that, although the number of criminal cases has remained fairly 
consistent over the past several years until 2020, the number of Lehigh County Defendants 
in LCJ has steadily decreased. This is because, even before the COVID-19 pandemic began, 
this  Court  and  the  Stakeholders  had  been  employing  strategies  to  limit  Lehigh  County 
Defendants in LCJ.

ote that, in January, February, and March of 2020, the ADP of Lehigh County Defendants 
in LCJ was  already at historic lows. (Compare annual totals shown on chart on page 6.) 
Thereafter,  the  LCJ  population  decreased  further  before  rising  in  the  Fall.  In  December 
2020, the CCC was closed in order to reallocate staff to LCJ necessitated by COVID-19 
related absences. The ADP of the CCC residents steadily declined through December, 2020.

A Random Representative Sample  
 

One might argue that this Court is not following the directions contained in the Supreme 
Court’s April 3, 2020 order because the ADP of LCJ in December, 2020 of 637 Lehigh County 
Defendants was slightly higher than the ADP in March, 2020 of 627 defendants, which represents 
46% of LCJ’s 1,363 total capacity. (See page 5). However, the ADP declined through May, 2020 
and rose slowly thereafter but did not exceed the March, 2020 ADP until December, 2020. Also, 
the  data  on  the  prior  chart  shows  that  new  criminal  cases  decreased  in  April  and  May  but  then 
exceeded pre-COVID-19 pandemic 2020 levels from June through October until dropping as winter 
began. Ii is important to understand that the population of LCJ changes daily and will continue to 
do so, as inmates are released and new defendants are committed.  

n order to understand the composition of the Lehigh County Defendant population in LCJ 

at any given time, a random representative sample of a specific date is illustrative:  

n January 26, 2021, there were 562 Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ  – the only LCJ 
inmates over whom this Court has jurisdiction. In addition, there were 136 federal, state or other 
jurisdiction  inmates  –  LCJ  inmates  over  whom  this  Court  has  no  jurisdiction.  That  figure  is  75 
inmates fewer than the average ADP for the preceding month of December, 2020 (637), and 65 
inmates  fewer  than  the  ADP  for  March,  2020  (627).  The  January  26,  2021  population  of  562 
represents 41% of LCJ’s 1363 total capacity. 

he  composition  of  the  562  Lehigh  County  Defendants  in  LCJ  on  January  26,  2021  is 

depicted on the chart below:

Forty-eight percent (48%), or 268, of the 562 Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ on 
January  26,  2021  had  been  convicted  and  were  serving  sentences,  which  cannot  be 
summarily  shortened,  waived  or  suspended  under  the  law.  Also,  releasing  those 
defendants before they are eligible for parole would be against the public interest for a 
variety of reasons. Though 23 of these 268 defendants were eligible for parole, they 
remained incarcerated because: they desired to serve their maximum sentences; were 
subject to detainers from other counties and did not want to be transferred to another 
jail;  or  did  not  have  housing.  In  some  cases,  family  members  and/or  friends  of  the 
defendant  did  not  respond  to  requests  to  secure  a  residence  for  the  defendant.  It  is 
important to remember that releasing an inmate to the street could endanger that person 
and  would  prevent  the  Adult  Probation  and  Parole  Department  from  providing 
supervision due to being unable to contact the defendant.  

•  Eight percent (8%), or 48, of the 562 Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ on January 26, 
2021 were incarcerated as a sanction for violating their probation either for technical 
reasons or by getting arrested on new charges. 

Six percent (6%), or 30, of the 562 Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ on January 26, 
2021  had  their  bail  revoked  because  they  failed  to  appear  for  Court  or  otherwise 
violated conditions of bail. One defendant was incarcerated as a sanction for contempt 
of a Protection From Abuse Order. 

  Twenty-nine percent (29%), or 165, of the 562 Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ on 
January 26, 2021 were pending disposition (between arrest and trial) of felony offenses. 

  Nine percent (9%), or 50, of the 562 Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ on January 26, 
2021 were pending disposition (between arrest and trial) of misdemeanor offenses.

ithin  a  short  time  after  January  26,  2021,  approximately  20  of  the  213  Lehigh  County 
Defendants  in  LCJ  pending  disposition  of  criminal  charges  have  been  released  through  bail 
reductions or dispositions through the normal course of procedure.    
 

Certainly, the number of Lehigh County Defendants in LCJ will vary daily due to a variety 
of factors.  Though it may decrease through the normal course of procedure and/or the additional 
efforts  of  this  Court  and  the  Stakeholders  employed  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  or 
increase from  time to  time despite the best efforts of  the Court and  the  Stakeholders, there is a 
reasonable basis for the current Lehigh County Defendant population in LCJ.

In  each  criminal  case,  the  considerations  involved  in  determining  appropriate  bail  for  a 
particular  Lehigh  County  Defendant  that  are  required  by  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Criminal 
Procedure are reviewed by the Magisterial District Judges at the outset of a case; then again by the 
District Attorney, Public Defender, private defense attorneys, and Pretrial Services; and still again 
by this Court. At each stage, every effort is made to assign a reasonable bail for each defendant in 
accordance with these statutory considerations, with the release of the defendant being the preferred 
option  if  safely  possible  for  all  concerned,  including  the  victim  and  the  public.  The  random 
representative sample discussed at pages 8 to 10 demonstrates that most Lehigh County Defendants 
in LCJ have serious charges and/or detainers and/or other issues which must be addressed. Very 
few Lehigh County Defendants remain incarcerated solely due to an inability to post bail and, when 
that is the case, are typically addressed in the normal course of procedure.  

t is important to remember that no bail is set for defendants charged with summary offenses, 
but that summary offenses are lesser-included offenses of felonies and misdemeanors, for which 
bail is set. Thus, a mere cursory review of the lists of criminal offenses charged against the Lehigh 
County  Defendants  in  LCJ,  which  will,  at  any  given  time,  include  lesser-included  summary 
offenses, could lead to the mistaken conclusion that defendants are being held in LCJ because of 
an inability to post bail on summary offenses alone.    

ehigh County is extremely fortunate to be served by Lehigh Valley Pretrial Services, one 
of  the  premier  bail  agencies  in  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and  the  bail  agency  Court-
appointed by this Court for Lehigh County.  Its highly experienced and dedicated officers interview 
defendants; conduct background investigations, make recommendations on bail and/or conditions 
of release to the Court or Magisterial  District Court, as appropriate; supervise defendants in the 
community while on bail; and report any violations of bail to the Court or Magisterial District Court.  

ommunity Resources  

This Court and the Stakeholders recognize that crime is directly impacted by a variety of 
social factors including, but not limited to: poverty and lack of proper food and clothing, lack of 
safe and affordable housing, lack of access to mental health evaluations, treatment and medication, 
drug  and  alcohol  addiction,  unemployment,  lack  of  transportation,  problems  associated  with 
education and insufficient education support. For this reason, efforts to effect positive change in 
these  areas  by  public  and  private  organizations,  agencies  and  individual  volunteers,  can 
meaningfully contribute to reduce the crime rate and lessen the demands upon the criminal justice 
system, thereby helping to lower rates of incarceration.

INTERVENTIONS AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES UTILIZED IN  
THE LEHIGH COUNTY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 

 

The Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County (“Court”), the Magisterial District Judges 

of Lehigh County, the Office of the District Attorney of Lehigh County, the Public Defender of 

Lehigh County, the Lehigh County Adult Probation and Parole Department, Lehigh Valley Pretrial 

Services,    the  Lehigh  County  Department  of  Corrections,  the  Lehigh  County  Department  of 

Human Services, conflicts attorneys, and private criminal defense attorneys (“Stakeholders”) have, 

for many years, been engaged in a continuing cooperative and collaborative effort to review cases 

for reduced bail where appropriate, to resolve cases at the earliest time reasonably possible, and to 

utilize  all  possible  interventions  and  resources  to  prevent  incarceration  in  the  Lehigh  County 

criminal justice system. 

The  following  is  a  list  of  some  of  the  interventions  and  community  resources  utilized 

prepared by some of the Stakeholders. This list is not exhaustive of every resource or intervention 

available; but is a representative compilation. Some of these interventions were created specifically 

as  part  of  the  criminal  justice  system  in  Lehigh  County  and  others  are  existing  community 

resources that are accessed and utilized, as appropriate, by that system. 

Over-arching the long-standing effort by the Court and Stakeholders to develop and utilize 

interventions  and  resources  to  prevent  incarceration,  is  the  Lehigh  County  Criminal  Justice 

Advisory  Board  (CJAB),  a  cross-systems,  multi-disciplinary  communication  and  collaboration 

board comprised of representative members of institutions and agencies in Lehigh County that was 

created approximately 20 years ago. Over those 20 years CJAB has enhanced our ability to address 

the many factors involved in criminal justice and continues to do so.

management,  sex  offender  treatment  and  other  programming  afforded  at  the 

Community Correction Center; 

o  Upon  successful  completion,  the  defendant  is  released  from  the  Community 

Corrections  Center  without  a  Probation/Parole  violation  or  loss  of  “street 

time.”  The Out-Mate Program accomplishes the three primary goals of reducing 

the  number  of  probation/parole  technical  violations,  enforcing  court  compliance 

and preventing incarceration.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
