RE:

Public Health Emergency Response/Courts

Effective immediately and until further notice, to protect Court employees from
being exposed to health threatening conditions and, therefore, reducing the chance of
exposing colleagues and members of the public, the Court adopts the following policy:

I. General Procedures

1.

Any employee who believes he/she may have been exposed to the
coronavirus must report
the potential exposure to his/her supervisor or department
head/Judge immediately. Upon report of the incident,
the supervisor or department
head/Judge will provide Court Administration with the details of potential exposure.
Reported incidents will be responded to on a case by case basis.

2.

Employees who have symptoms of acute, respiratory illness are required
to stay home and not come to work until they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any
other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reducing or other symptom
altering medications.
Signs and symptoms generally include combinations of the
following:
coughing, sneezing, other respiratory symptoms, fever, sweating, chills,
muscle aches, weakness, and malaise.

3.

The Court reserves the right to require self-isolation of an employee in
appropriate circumstances (e.g. travel to foreign country) even absent outward symptoms.

4.
Employees who appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms upon
arrival
to work or become sick during the work day, shall be separated from other
employees and be sent home immediately. Work areas should be thoroughly cleaned
with an EPA approved disinfectant on a routine basis. Areas to consider are work
stations, phones, fax machines, copiers, break rooms, and other common objects or areas.

5.

Employees may be asked to work remotely for a period of time after being
exposed. This period will be in accordance with federal, state, and/or local health
guidelines. We will adhere to the guidance of the public health authorities.

6.
return to work.

Employees may be required to provide a medical note releasing them to

II. Court Scheduling and Related Matters

As of today, March 17, 2020,

the 35th Judicial District, unless noted below,
remains open and operational. We are continuing to rely upon the guidance of the
Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts and federal, state, and local health
departments both to limit potential exposure and fulfill our responsibility to the citizens
of Mercer County by keeping our services available.

1.

All Judges when reasonably possible shall do the following:

a.
Utilize and encourage litigants to utilize to the fullest extent
available
services
advanced
communication technology to reduce personal appearances for hearings,
trials, meetings, conferences, and similar proceedings or gatherings.

telephonic/video/audio

other

and

b.
Stagger court appearance times to reduce crowding. Require
people to spread out in the courtroom. Prop doors open to avoid necessity
of handles or knobs being touched.

c.
Limit meetings, conferences, and other gatherings to essential
participants and arrange seating to avoid unnecessary close personal
contact.

Develop the capability to work remotely from the court facility

d.
with assistance if necessary from Mercer County MIS.

i.

For jury trials, utilize only 1 alternate.

Discuss with litigants the possibility of utilizing less than the

ii.
maximum number of jurors in civil cases.

e.

Other than the modifications described above Judges shall schedule and
conduct hearings and trials in essentially the same manner they were scheduled and
conducted before the outbreak of coronavirus.

2.

The Mercer County Sheriffs Deputies and Mercer County Constables are
hereby authorized and directed to decline transportation of prisoners from any prison/jail
despite a valid transportation order if, using his/her reasonable discretion, the prisoner to
be transported appears to be sick or may have recently (within the last 14 days) been in
contact with someone who is positive for coronavirus. Any Sheriff Deputy or Constable
declining transportation on this basis shall immediately contact the appropriate Judge
involved in the subject case.

Similarly, any Mercer County Sheriff Deputies, Constables, or Juvenile Probation
Officer (JPO) ordered to transport any juvenile from a juvenile detention facility
placement or other place of detainment are hereby authorized and directed to decline
transportation of said juvenile from any juvenile detention facility placement or other
place of detainment despite a valid transportation order if, using his/her reasonable
discretion, the juvenile to be transported appears to be sick or may have recently (within
the last 14 days) been in contact with someone who is positive for coronavirus. Any
Sheriff Deputy, Constable, or
shall
immediately contact the appropriate Judge involved in the subject case.

JPO declining transportation on this basis

Transportation of

incarcerated/detained out of county witnesses, criminal
defendants, juvenile defendants, or similar persons for all Mercer County trials, hearings,
or other proceedings shall be avoided if such persons may adequately participate by
telephonic/video/audio devices and other advance communication technology.

3.

The Mercer County Court Administrator shall do the following:

a.
Arrange to limit the number of jurors coming into the courthouse
at 50 per time, or in the alternative,
to limit no more than 50 in one
location by using a second large room such as an accessible courtroom.
Seating for prospective jurors shall be staggered, if possible,
to reduce
juror crowding.

b.
Judges of Mercer County Common Pleas are hereby authorized to
order civil litigants to participate in mandatory mediation with mediation
costs shared by the parties.

4.

The Mercer County Bar Association is hereby requested to assist civil trial

Judges locating and utilizing such mediators.

5.

All Mercer County Judges,

and
Magisterial District Judges are to be vigilant about proactively requiring employees who
appear to be sick or may have recently (within the last 14 days) been in contact with
someone who is positive for coronavirus to stay home.

related department heads,

court

6.

Court employees will not attend off site conferences or trainings. Court
events/meetings (as distinguished from court hearings, conferences, etc.) will be
rescheduled or held virtually. When possible use email and electronic mediums to
create, file and transmit documents and court orders. Limit the number of persons in
chambers and other meeting/conference rooms to comply with social distancing
recommendations.

7.

Scheduling of larger court lists such as arraignment and call of the list will
be staggered by the hour or location to avoid larger groups of litigants and attorneys in
the courtroom. Scheduling will be adjusted starting as soon as possible.

a.
Until further notice, each month’s criminal call of the list shall be
divided among the four courtrooms to lessen the number of people in one
place and to allow spacing between individuals. One half of the April call
of the list will be handled by courtrooms 1 and 3 and one half will be
handled by courtrooms 2 and 4. The Judges shall determine the number of
cases in each courtroom. To the extent possible this division of cases shall
be provided to the Court Administrator who can post the same prior to the
commencement of call of the list.

8.

Waivers of arraignment will be accepted up to and including the day
scheduled for formal arraignment. Defendants who execute and file such waivers need
not attend court on that date. Those who will be entered into the ARD program or who
will enter a plea at that time must attend.

9.

Gagnon and parole violation hearings for

those in custody shall be

conducted by advanced communication and technology to the greatest extent possible.

10.

DRS establishment and modification conferences may be held by
telephone provided that the parties comply with document presentation requirements
prior to the conference as required and in the manner determined by the director of DRS.

11.

The Community Service Director shall continue to assign defendants to
work sites taking into consideration the need to limit that number of individuals at any
one place.
Should the lack of available work sites be the primary reason for the
defendant’s failure to timely complete his/her community service. The Court can
consider alternates, including but not limited to, extended time periods for completion of
community service, reducing the number of hours of community service, or waiving the
community service requirement altogether.

III. Miscellaneous

1.

Any party required to attend a scheduled court proceeding or who is
visiting the court facility to access a filing office is encouraged to arrive alone or in
smaller groups, if possible,
in an effort to decrease the possible spread of the virus.
Subject to constitutional consideration, the Court may at its discretion order any non-
party from the courtroom to help with social distancing.
Parties and visitors are
encouraged to stay home if you are feeling sick. Any party under court order to appear
for a proceeding of any type but is not feeling well should make a reasonable attempt to
notify Court Administration at
(724) 662-3800 ext. 2517, of their illness. Those
individuals who are represented by an attorney should ask their attorney to notify the
Court of your condition and ask that you be excused in advance or that you be permitted
to appear via alternate methods such as a video or telephone. Each case will be decided
by the Court on a case by case basis.

2.

All visitors and parties are encouraged to practice good hygiene when in a
court facility and refrain from shaking hands or other forms of physical contact. Use
other non-contact methods of greeting. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer on
regular intervals. Create habits and reminders to avoid touching faces and cover coughs
and sneezes.

NOTE:
procedures set forth above shall be eliminated, amended, and/or supplemented.
