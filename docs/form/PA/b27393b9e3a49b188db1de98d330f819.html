Mother accurately summarized the history of this case as follows: 

Child was born [in June 2019] to minor Mother [], who was 
herself  a  [17  year  old]  dependent  child  in  placement  with  [the 
Department of Human Services (DHS)].  The Child was placed with 
Mother in a mother/baby placement.  Mother was not compliant 
with her own placement and then left the mother/baby placement 
with  the  Child.    On  6/26/19,  an  [order  for  protective  custody 
(OPC)]  was  obtained  for  Child  and  she  was  placed  into  a  foster 
home.    When  drug  tested[,]  Mother  was  testing  positive  for 
marijuana.  On 8/16/19, a Single Case Plan was created requiring 
Mother  to  avail  herself  to  [the  Community  Umbrella  Agency 
(CUA)], to participate in AIC[1], to visit with Child twice weekly, to 
call and confirm visits with 24 hour notice, to participate in grief 
counseling,  to  complete  a  [Clinical  Evaluation  Unit  (CEU)] 
assessment  and  to  complete  three  random  drug  screens.    Child 
was adjudicated dependent on 8/28/19.  Several revisions of the 
Single  Case  Plan  were  created  but  the  objectives  for  Mother 
remained  essentially  the  same.    Throughout  the  life  of  the  case 
and  the  several  hearings,  Mother’s  compliance  was  rated  as 
minimal.   On 7/13/22, a  petition to terminate Mother’s parental 
rights and to change the goal to adoption was filed.  The matter 
came before the [c]ourt for trial on 9/30/22.  …   

Mother’s Brief at 8 (footnote added). 

On September 30, 2022, the trial court entered the decree terminating 

Mother’s parental rights, and the order changing Child’s permanency goal to 

adoption.2    Mother  timely  filed  notices  of  appeal  and concise statements of 

errors at both dockets.  Thereafter, the trial court advised it had “stated on 

the  record  the  reasons  for  …  terminating  parental  rights  and  changing  the 

1 AIC is not defined in the record.  However, the CUA case manager, Brenda 
Smith, testified that Mother’s case plan objectives included substance abuse 
and  mental  health  treatment,  parenting  classes,  appropriate  housing,  and 
proof of income.  N.T., 9/30/22, at 12. 

 The trial court also terminated the parental rights of J.W. (Father) and all 
unknown putative fathers on September 30, 2022.  No fathers have appealed.

Child’s  permanency  goal  to  adoption[.]”    Notice  of  Compliance  with  Rule  of 

Appellate Procedure 1925(a), 11/23/22, at 1-2.  This Court consolidated the 

hether  the  trial  court  committed  reversible  error  when  it 
terminated  Mother’s  parental  rights  and  changed  the  goal  to 
adoption on less than clear and convincing evidence? 
 

  W

Mother presents a single issue for review: 

Mother’s Brief at 7. 

appeals on December 20, 2022. 

 

Mother  concedes  that  DHS  proved  grounds  for  termination  under 

Section 2511(a).  She states: 

Mother  cannot  challenge  the  determination  that  DHS  presented 
clear and convincing evidence pursuant to 23 PA.C.S. [§] 2511(a) 
(1), (2), (5) and (8).  Mother did not successfully complete what 
were arguably reasonable objectives designed to reunite her with 
the Child, although she did make some efforts having completed 
parenting and housing classes and attending a significant number 
of visits with the Child.   The dispute  in this case is whether 
there was clear and convincing evidence that there was no 
bond between the Mother and the Child and that it was in 
the Child’s best interests to change the goal to adoption. 
 

Id. at 17-18 (emphasis added). 

 

Mother asserts the trial court abused its discretion because the evidence 

“clearly  and  convincingly  established  that  there  was  a  significant  bond” 

between  Mother  and  Child.    Id.  at  19.    Mother  claims  the  trial  court 

“disregarded compelling evidence from the CUA worker and Mother,” and its 

“judgment  of  no  harm  to  the  Child  was  speculative  at  best.”    Id.    Mother 

states, “For  instance, the evidence was clear and convincing that  there is a 

- 3 - 

J-S04001-23 

physical component to the bond: the Child hugs and kisses the Mother.  They 

hold hands.”  Id. at 17.  Mother further states: 

They play together.  Additionally, there was evidence that there 
was a significant bond in other ways, for instance the FaceTime 
moments  with  Mother’s  family.    The  CUA  worker  specifically 
testified that Mother acted appropriately during the visits, that she 
had  never  attended  a  visit  while  intoxicated  and  that,  most 
importantly,  the  Child  enjoyed  the  visits  with  her  Mother.    Had 
Mother ever been given a chance to interact with her Child in more 
natural  surroundings  than  an  office,  the  bond  would  have  been 
strengthened. 

Conversely,  DHS  asserts  “the  record  contains  ample,  clear  and 

convincing evidence that Child and Mother did not share a parent-child bond; 

that Child would not suffer irreparable harm from the termination of Mother’s 

parental rights; and that termination best suited her needs and welfare.”  DHS 

Brief  at  14.    Child’s  counsel,  noting  that  “subsection  2511(b)  requires 

consideration of the development and emotional needs of the child,” asserts 

the evidence “was clear that a bond did not exist between Mother and [C]hild.”  

Child Advocate Brief at 17.  Child’s counsel states: 

[C]hild  looks  to  her  foster  parents  to  meet  her  daily  needs.  [] 
Mother did not attend over half of her supervised visits during the 
time that the case has been open.  Mother does not have a bond 
with  [C]hild.    [C]hild  will  not  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  her 
biological  Mother’s  rights  are  terminated.    []Child  looks  to  her 
foster parents for love and affection. 
 
Id. at 17-18. 

 

We review Mother’s arguments mindful that

appellate courts must apply an abuse of discretion standard when 
considering  a  trial  court’s  determination  of  a  petition  for 
termination  of  parental  rights.    As  in  dependency  cases,  our 
standard  of  review  requires  an  appellate  court  to  accept  the 
findings of fact and credibility determinations of the trial court if 
they  are  supported  by  the  record.    If  the  factual  findings  are 
supported, appellate courts review to determine if the trial court 
made an error of law or abused its discretion.  As has been often 
stated, an abuse of discretion does not result merely because the 
reviewing  court  might  have  reached  a  different  conclusion.  
Instead,  a  decision  may  be  reversed  for  an  abuse  of  discretion 
only upon demonstration of manifest unreasonableness, partiality, 
prejudice, bias, or ill-will. 
 

In  re  Adoption  of  S.P.,  47  A.3d  817,  826  (Pa.  2012)  (citations  omitted).  

The  burden  is  on  the  petitioner  “to  prove  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence 

that [the] asserted grounds for seeking the termination of parental rights are 

valid.”  In re R.N.J., 985 A.2d 273, 276 (Pa. Super. 2009).   

Pertinently, Section 2511(b) provides: 

(b) Other considerations.—The court in terminating the rights 
of a parent shall give primary consideration to the developmental, 
physical and emotional needs and welfare of the child.  The rights 
of  a  parent  shall  not  be  terminated  solely  on  the  basis  of 
environmental  factors  such  as  inadequate  housing,  furnishings, 
income,  clothing  and  medical  care  if  found  to  be  beyond  the 
control of the parent.  With respect to any petition filed pursuant 
to subsection (a)(1), (6) or (8), the court shall not consider any 
efforts by the parent to remedy the conditions described therein 
which are first initiated subsequent to the giving of notice of the 
filing of the petition. 

3 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(b). 

  2

When  considering Section 2511(b),  “the  court  must  take  into  account 

whether  a  bond  exists  between  child  and  parent,  and  whether  termination 

would destroy an existing, necessary and beneficial relationship.”  In re L.W., 

J-S04001-23 

- 5 - 

J-S04001-23 

267 A.3d 517, 523 (Pa. Super. 2021) (citation omitted).  “[I]n addition to a 

bond examination, the trial court can equally emphasize the safety needs of 

the child, and should also consider the intangibles, such as the love, comfort, 

security,  and  stability  the  child  might  have  with  the  foster  parent.”   Id. 

(citations omitted).  “[A] parent’s basic constitutional right to the custody and 

rearing of ... her child is converted, upon the failure to fulfill ... her parental 

duties,  to  the  child’s  right  to  have  proper  parenting  and  fulfillment  of  [the 

child’s] potential in a permanent, healthy, safe environment.”  Id. 

The  record  does  not  support  Mother’s  argument.    The  CUA  case 

manager, Ms. Smith, testified that Child continues to reside in the same foster, 

pre-adoptive  home  where  Child  was  placed  in  2019,  when  she  was  three 

weeks  old.    N.T.,  9/30/22,  at  33.    The  foster  family  consists  of  a  mother, 

father,  one  biological  child  and  two  foster  children  with  whom  Child  has 

bonded.  Id. at 34, 40.  Ms. Smith opined that Child’s foster family provides 

Child with love, safety, stability, and support; she also testified that the foster 

family meets Child’s emotional, medical, developmental, and daily needs.  Id.  

Ms. Smith testified that Child’s “primary parent-child bond” is with her foster 

mother.    Id.    Critically,  when  asked  whether  she  believed  there  was  “any 

parent-child bond  between” Mother and Child,  Ms.  Smith  stated:  “No, I do 

not.”  Id.  Ms. Smith described Child’s visits with Mother “as more of a play 

date.”  Id. at 35.  Ms. Smith stated that after Child’s visits with Mother, Child 

“just expresses that she’s ready to go home to [foster] mommy.”  Id. at 52.  

- 6 - 

Ms. Smith further concluded that termination was in Child’s best interest.  Id. 

[The foster home] is where [Child has] been since she was three 
weeks [old,] she’s currently three years, three months [old].  [The 
pre-adoptive  foster  parents]  are  who  she  looks  at  for  comfort, 
love,  as  well  as  support.    She  identifies  [foster  mother]  as  the 
mom, and the foster father as Darrell. 

Anytime  she  sees  me,  all  she  wants  is,  “Darrell,  Darrell,” 
and she’s asking me for “Mom, mom.”  So this is all she knows.  
The [pre-adoptive foster parents] provide everything for her. 
 

N.T., 9/30/22, at 39.  Ms. Smith opined that termination would not cause Child 

   

irreparable harm.  Id.  To the contrary, Ms. Smith believed Child would suffer 

irreparable harm if she were removed from her foster family.  Id. 

 

Mother testified that she and Child interact as “daughter and mommy[.]”  

Id. at 66.  She described her visits with Child as “calm” and affectionate.  Id. 

at 65.  Mother relayed that she tells Child, “people are watching over” Child 

because Mother is “trying to get [herself] together.”  Id.  Mother admitted she 

last cared for Child in 2019, when Child was three weeks old.  Id. at 74. 

 

In addition, Child’s attorney, Lisa Visco, advised: 

I am in agreement with the termination, Your Honor.  This child 
has been at [her foster] home for three years.  She’s bonded with 
the family there, and it’s in her best interest to be adopted. 
 

N.T., 9/30/22, at 86. 

On this record, the trial court concluded “there was no evidence [that] 

a parent-child bond existed between Mother and Child.”  Notice of Compliance 

J-S04001-23 

at 39.  She explained: 

- 7 - 

with  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  1925(a),  11/23/22,  at  2.    The  trial  court 

[T]he fact that [C]hild knows who [Mother] is and interacts with 
her, does not establish a parent-child bond ...   
 

There’s  simply  no  evidence  of  the  parent-child  bond  with 
[Mother] and this child.  [Mother] has not acted in a maternal way 
towards this child throughout the life of this case.  Having limited 
visits is not sufficient to establish that type of bond …. 

.T., 9/30/22, at 96-97. 

The court continued: 

[C]hild has been in the same home for virtually all of her life.  She 
came into care at three weeks old, and she is now three.  It is in 
[C]hild’s  best interest to be freed for adoption and  to terminate 
[Mother’s] parental rights in this case. 
 

I do not find that [C]hild would suffer any irreparable harm.  
[Child] knows who [Mother is], but she does not look to [Mother] 
as [a] parent … 

gain, under 2511(b), there is no evidence that there is a parental 
bond, despite counsel’s argument to the contrary.  …  There’s no 
indication that [C]hild looks to [Mother] as a mom.  The fact that 
[Child]  knows  [Mother]  and  may  enjoy  spending  time  with  her 
does not establish there is a parent-child bond, which is necessary 
under 2511(b). 

.T., 9/30/22, at 98-100. 

The  trial  court’s  reasoning  is  consistent  with  both  the  record  and 

applicable law.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion 

in terminating Mother’s parental rights pursuant to Section 2511(b). 

Decree and Order affirmed.
