In the Court of Common Pleas of Carbon County Civil Division at No(s):

EFORE:   KING, J., SULLIVAN, J., and STEVENS, P.J.E.* 

MEMORANDUM BY STEVENS, P.J.E.: 

 

     FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

 

Appellant  Kensey  Shanfelt  (“Appellant”)  appeals  from  the  June  29, 

2022, order entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Carbon County, which 

granted Appellee Progressive Advanced Insurance Company’s (“Progressive”) 

motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Appellant’s complaint for 

declaratory judgment in its entirety with prejudice. After a careful review, we 

affirm.  

 

The  relevant  facts  and  procedural  history  are  as  follows:  On  July  23, 

2021,  Appellant  filed  a  complaint  against  Progressive  seeking  a  declaratory 

judgment  that  she  is  entitled  to  stacked  Underinsured  Motorist  Benefits. 

____________________________________________

J-A03002-23 

Appellant alleged that, on June 4, 2012, her father, Kenneth W. Shanfelt (“Mr. 

Shanfelt”),  purchased  an  automobile  insurance  policy  (“the  policy”)  from 

Progressive, which identified Mr. Shanfelt as the named insured with Appellant 

and her  mother, Holly J. Shanfelt (“Mrs. Shanfelt”), as  insured drivers.  The 

policy listed three covered vehicles: a 2010 Ford Focus, a 2008 Ford Escape, 

and  a  2000  Ford  Taurus.  Appellant  averred  that  at  all  relevant  times  she 

resided with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Shanfelt. She also averred the three 

listed vehicles were owned by Mr. and Mrs. Shanfelt. 

 

The policy’s declaration page outlined Underinsured Motorist Benefits in 

the amount of $100,000 each person/$300,000 each accident separately for 

all  three  automobiles  listed  in  the  policy.    However,  on  June  4,  2012,  Mr. 

Shanfelt,  the  named  insured,  executed  an  Underinsured  Motorist  Stacking 

Waiver.  Neither  Mrs.  Shanfelt  nor  Appellant  executed  an  Underinsured 

Motorist Stacking Waiver related to the policy.  

 

Thereafter, twice in 2015, Mr. Shanfelt requested vehicles be removed 

from the policy and replaced with different vehicles.  Each time, no additional 

changes were made to the policy, and another Underinsured Motorist Stacking 

Waiver was not executed.  

 

 Appellant alleged that, on June 12, 2017, Mrs. Shanfelt and Appellant 

purchased a 2013 Ford Edge.  She asserted Mr. Shanfelt was not an owner of 

the  2013 Ford  Edge.  Appellant  averred  Mrs.  Shanfelt  requested  that  one  of 

the vehicles, which was owned by Mr. Shanfelt and Mrs. Shanfelt, be removed 

- 2 - 

J-A03002-23 

from the policy, and the 2013 Ford Edge, which was owned by Appellant and 

Mrs. Shanfelt, be added to the policy.  No further changes were made to the 

policy. Neither Appellant nor Mrs. Shanfelt executed an Underinsured Motorist 

Stacking Waiver.   

On April 13, 2021, while Appellant was operating the 2013 Ford Edge in 

Lehigh  Township,  she  was  struck  by  another  driver,  Shelly  Carney  (“Ms. 

Carney”),  who  was  operating  a  2019  Nissan  Rogue.  Appellant  alleged  she 

suffered serious and permanent injuries from the accident. Ms. Carney had an 

automobile insurance policy with Geico Secure Insurance Company (“Geico”), 

which  provided  for  a  bodily  injury  liability  limit  of  $100,000  each 

person/$300,000  each  accident.  Geico  tendered  to  Appellant  the  individual 

policy limit of $100,000.  

Appellant  then  made  a  demand  of  stacked  Underinsured  Motorist 

Benefits in the amount of $300,000 from Progressive; however, Progressive 

denied the demand. Accordingly, Appellant filed the instant complaint seeking 

a declaration that she is entitled to stacked Underinsured Motorist Benefits in 

the  amount  of  $300,000  as  it  relates  to  the  April  13,  2021,  motor  vehicle 

collision.  

On September 27, 2021, Progressive filed an answer with new matter. 

As it relates to the three vehicles initially listed in the policy (the 2010 Ford 

Focus, the 2008 Ford Escape, and the 2000 Ford Taurus), Progressive averred 

“[t]he owners of the vehicles are not identified by the application and hence 

- 3 - 

J-A03002-23 

the  remaining  allegations  [regarding  ownership]  are  denied.”  Progressive’s 

Answer with New Matter, filed 9/27/21, at ¶ 6.  As  to Appellant’s  assertions 

she  resided  with  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Shanfelt;  Appellant  and  Mrs.  Shanfelt  were 

exclusively  the  owners  of  the  2013  Ford  Edge;  and,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Shanfelt 

were  the  sole  owners  of  prior  vehicles  listed  on  the  policy,  Progressive 

responded as follows: “[a]fter reasonable investigation, answering defendant 

is unable to admit or deny these allegations and will insist upon strict proof of 

same at the time of trial.”  Id. at ¶¶ 8, 16, 18, 19.  

In  its  new  matter,  Progressive  asserted  the  named  insured,  Mr. 

Shanfelt, signed a valid Section 1738 stacking rejection on June 4, 2012, and 

a  new  stacking  waiver  is  not  required  when  a  vehicle  listed  in  the  policy  is 

replaced by another vehicle. Thus, Progressive argued stacking is not available 

pursuant to the policy at issue.  

On  July  27,  2022,  Progressive  filed  a  motion  for  judgment  on  the 

pleadings.  Progressive  averred  it  is  undisputed  the  named  insured,  Mr. 

Shanfelt, executed a valid waiver of stacked Underinsured Motorist Benefits 

on June 14, 2012, with three vehicles listed in the policy.  Progressive further 

averred it is undisputed that, twice in 2015 and once in 2017, vehicles were 

removed  and  added;  however,  each  time,  three  vehicles  remained  listed  in 

the policy. Progressive asserted that “[a]t all relevant times since the waiver 

form was signed the policy issued by Progressive insured three vehicles with 

- 4 - 

J-A03002-23 

$100,000  per  person/$300,000  per  accident  non-stacked  benefits.” 

Progressive’s Motion, filed 7/27/22, at ¶ 12.  

Progressive asserted “[t]he declarations pages issued by Progressive in 

force  at  the  time  of  the  loss  noted  that  the  coverages  for  the  three  listed 

vehicles, which included the 2013 Ford Edge…, was non-stacked.” Id. at ¶ 13. 

Accordingly,  Progressive  contended  that,  since  the  initial  waiver  of  stacking 

form was in effect at the time of Appellant’s accident, she is not entitled to 

the stacking of Underinsured Motorist Benefits such that Progressive is entitled 

to judgment on the pleadings as a matter of law. 

On  February  18,  2022,  Appellant  filed  a  reply  in  opposition  to 

Progressive’s  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings.  Therein,  Appellant 

averred the trial court should deny Progressive’s motion since (1) there is a 

dispute  regarding  material  issues  of  fact  (i.e.,  ownership  of  the  vehicles 

subject  to  the  policy),  and  (2)  Progressive  is  not  otherwise  entitled  to 

judgment as a matter of law. 

On June 29, 2022, the trial court entered an order granting Progressive’s 

motion for judgment on the pleadings1 and dismissing Appellant’s complaint 

for declaratory judgment in its entirety with prejudice. The trial court filed an

a demurrer. It may be entered when there are no disputed issues of fact, and

opinion in support of its order on that same date. This timely appeal followed. 

On August 1, 2022, the trial court directed Appellant to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) 

statement,2 and Appellant timely complied on August 17, 2022. 

In  her  court-ordered  Rule  1925(b)  statement,  Appellant  raised  the 

following issues (verbatim):  

1.  The  trial  court  erred  by  granting  Defendant’s  Motion  for 

Judgment on the Pleadings because: 

a.  The  Order  and  Amended  Memorandum  Opinion  are 
contrary to the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law 
and Pennsylvania public policy; 

b.  The  Motor  Vehicle  Financial  Responsibility  Law  permits 
intrapolicy stacking of underinsured motorist benefits; 

c.  Any waiver of stacking was void based upon the failure 
of  the  Defendant/Appellee  to  request  and  receive 
updated waivers when the policy was amended on April 

____________________________________________ 

2 We note Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(3) provides as follows: 

(3)  Contents  of  order. The  judge’s  order  directing  the  filing  and 
service of a Statement shall specify: 
(i) the number of days after the date of entry of the judge’s order 
within which the appellant must file and serve the Statement; 
(ii) that the Statement shall be filed of record; 
(iii) that the Statement shall be served on the judge pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) and both the place the appellant can serve the 
Statement in person and the address to which the appellant can 
mail the Statement. In addition, the judge may provide an email, 
facsimile, or other alternative means for the appellant to serve the 
Statement on the judge; and 
(iv) that any issue not properly included in the Statement timely 
filed  and  served  pursuant  to  subdivision  (b)  shall  be  deemed 
waived. 

Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(3) (italics in original).  
 
In the case sub judice, the trial court’s order complies with Subsection 
1925(b)(3) in all respects.  Further, we note the certified docket entries reveal 
the Prothonotary served the trial court’s Rule 1925(b) order upon Appellant in 
accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 236.

23,  2015,  and  July  2,  2015,  to  add  and/or  remove 
vehicles from the policy; 

d.  Any waiver of stacking was void based upon the failure 
of  the  Defendant/Appellee  to  offer  Plaintiff/Appellant  a 
new  waiver  when  the  policy  was  amended  on  April  23, 
2015, and July 2, 2015, to add and/or remove  vehicles 
from the policy; 

e.  Any  waiver  of  stacking  was  void  because  the  vehicle 
added to the policy was owned by a person who was not 
previously  the  owner  of  any  vehicle  insured  under  the 
policy,  thereby  requiring  the  Defendant/Appellee  to 
obtain a new waiver; and 

f.  Th[e]  Court  erred  by  failing  to  distinguish  between  the 
legal  requirements 
for  a 
replacement  vehicle  rather  than  a  vehicle  owned  by 
different  persons,  including  a  person  not  previously 
insured under the policy.  

for  obtaining  a  waiver 

Appellant’s Rule 1925(b) Statement, filed 8/17/22, at 1-2.  The trial court filed 

 

a Rule 1925(a) opinion on August 24, 2022. 

 

On appeal, Appellant contends the following: 

I. 

The  trial  court  prematurely  granted  judgment  on  the 
pleadings  without  permitting  the  parties  to  conduct 
discovery  on  the  disputed  factual  issues  relating  to  the 
addition  of  a  new  vehicle  on  the  motor  vehicle  insurance 
policy. 
 

Appellant’s Brief at 10 (bold omitted).3  

____________________________________________ 

3 While Appellant phrased her issue slightly different in the “Statement of the 
Question  Involved”  portion  of  her  brief,  the  issue  we  set  forth  is  from  the 
Argument heading of her brief. As discussed infra, the entire Argument portion 
of Appellant’s brief is dedicated to her averment the trial court erred in failing 
to  order  additional  discovery  to  resolve  alleged  disputed  issues  of  material 
facts.  Thus,  to  the  extent  Appellant’s  “Statement  of  the  Question  Involved” 
raises a different issue than the one developed in the Argument portion of her 
brief, absent relevant argument, we find it to be waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 2119.  

- 7 - 

J-A03002-23 

 

Appellant  contends  there  are  genuine  issues  of  material  fact,  and 

Progressive improperly filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings prior to 

the  completion  of  discovery.  Id.  at  11.  She  suggests  that,  during  oral 

argument  on  Progressive’s  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings,  she 

requested  discovery  regarding  the  ownership  of  the  vehicles  in  the  policy, 

including the 2013 Ford Edge, as well as for discussions between Progressive’s 

agent and Appellant “when the vehicle was added to the policy.”  Id. at 12. 

Appellant asserts the trial court did not have sufficient information to answer 

the  pertinent  legal  questions  regarding  Appellant’s  right  to  Underinsured 

Motorists  Benefits  since  the  issues  “arise  from  facts  not  currently  known 

because of the lack of discovery.” Id. at 13.  Consequently, Appellant contends 

that, since factual issues remain to be resolved, “this Court should vacate the 

grant  of  the  Motion  for  Judgment  on  the  Pleadings  and  remand  for  further 

discovery.”  Id. at 16.  

 

Preliminarily, we address whether Appellant has properly preserved her 

appellate issue for our review.  Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) provides, in relevant part, 

“[i]ssues not included in the Statement and/or not raised in accordance with 

the provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) are waived.” Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vii).  

As this Court has recognized: 

Our Supreme Court intended the holding in [Commonwealth v. 
Lord, 719 A.2d 306 (Pa. 1998),] to operate as a bright-line rule, 
such  that  failure  to  comply  with  the  minimal  requirements  of 
Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) will result in automatic waiver of the issues 
raised....Indeed,  our  Supreme  Court  does  not  countenance 

- 8 - 

J-A03002-23 

anything less than stringent application of waiver pursuant to Rule 
1925(b)[.] 
 

Greater  Erie  Indus.  Dev.  Corp.  v.  Presque  Isle  Downs,  Inc.,  88  A.3d 

222, 224 (Pa.Super. 2014) (en banc) (some citations and internal quotation 

marks omitted; emphasis in original). 

 

Moreover, in interpreting Rule 1925(b), our Supreme Court recently held 

as follows: 

The  purpose  of  a  Rule  1925(b)  statement  is  to  facilitate 
appellate review and to provide the parties and the public with the 
legal basis for a judicial decision.  To this end, Rule 1925(b)(4)(ii) 
provides that the Rule 1925(b) statement “shall concisely identify 
each error that the appellant intends to assert with sufficient detail 
to  identify  the  issue  to  be  raised  for  the  judge.”    Pa.R.A.P. 
1925(b)(4)(ii)  (emphasis  added).    Highlighting  this  need  for 
conciseness, Rule 1925(b)(4)(iv) indicates that the Rule 1925(b) 
statement  “should  not  be  redundant  or  provide 
lengthy 
explanations as to any error.”  Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(iv).  On the 
other hand, the Rule 1925(b) statement cannot be too concise, as 
it  must  properly  specify  the  errors  to  be  addressed  on 
appeal....Pursuant to Rule 1925(b)(5)(vii), “[i]ssues not included 
in  the  Statement  and/or  not  raised  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) are waived.” 

 
To ensure that a Rule 1925(b) statement is both concise but 
also sufficiently detailed to identify all of the issues desired to be 
raised on appeal, Rule 1925(b)(4)(v) provides that “[e]ach error 
identified  in  the  Statement  will  be  deemed  to  include  every 
subsidiary  issue  that  was  raised  in  the  trial  court[.]”  Pa.R.A.P. 
1925(b)(4)(v) (emphasis added).   

 
The  text  of  these  rules  emphasizes  that  to  be  “subsidiary 
issues,” the unstated issue must be  “included” within the stated 
issue….Conversely, an unstated issue is not subsidiary when it is 
separate and distinct from the stated issue.

Commonwealth  v.  Price,  284  A.3d  165,  170-71  (Pa.  2022)  (citations, 

quotation marks, and footnote omitted). 

 

In  the  case  sub  judice,  Appellant’s  court-ordered  Rule  1925(b) 

statement  made  no  reference  to  the  trial  court  prematurely  granting 

Progressive’s motion for judgment on the pleadings or the trial court’s failure 

to  order  additional  discovery  to  resolve  alleged  disputed  issues  of  material 

fact.4    See  Price,  supra.  Consequently,  we  find  Appellant  has  waived  for 

appellate review her sole issue developed in her brief,5 and, thus, we affirm. 

ate: 3/21/2023 

____________________________________________ 

4 In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, which incorporated the June 29, 2022, opinion, 
the trial court concluded that, as a matter of law, Progressive was entitled to 
judgment on the pleadings.  The trial court did not address the issue raised in 
Appellant’s  brief  regarding  whether  additional  discovery  was  required  to 
resolve disputed issues of material fact. 

 In accordance with Price, supra, we conclude the issue raised in Appellant’s 
brief is not a “subsidiary issue” of the issues presented in her Rule 1925(b) 
statement.    That  is,  whether  the  trial  court  should  have  ordered  additional 
discovery to resolve disputed issues of material fact  is not “included” within 
the issues raised by Appellant in her Rule 1925(b) statement; but rather, it is 
separate and distinct from the stated issues as set forth supra.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
