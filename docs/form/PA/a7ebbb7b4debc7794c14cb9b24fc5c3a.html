Act 49 Reauthorization 
Act 49 Reauthorization 

Act 93 of 2021 extended the $11.25 and $10 Act 49 
surcharges until June 30, 2022.  Under statute, revenue 
from the surcharges funds a significant portion – nearly 
$60 million – of the judiciary’s operational budget.  

Budget
Budget

On Feb. 8, the governor proposed his 2022-23 budget. 
Overall, the state budget would increase spending by 16.6 
percent. For the first time in several years, the proposed 
budget for the judiciary includes a funding increase of 
$35.88 million (10.1 percent), for a total state funding 
level of $391.9 million. The governor also proposed that 
the diversion of $15 million from the Judicial Computer 
System Augmentation Account to the School Safety and 
Security Fund pursuant to Act 42 of 2018 not occur in FY 
2022-23. This is just the first step in a long process and the 
governor’s proposal does not guarantee increased funding 
will occur. Additionally, the Act 49 surcharges, which as 
noted above were just reauthorized in December, must 
again be addressed in the 2022-23 budget.

Judge Beth Lazzara stands with the treatment court graduates at the ceremony on Dec. 20. 

Allegheny County Mental Health 
Court Celebrates 20th Anniversary 

In a ceremony on Dec. 20, 12 participants graduated from Allegheny County’s Mental Health Court – a special occasion 
marking its 20th anniversary.

Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Beth Lazzara

Beth Lazzara has presided over the program for the last 10 years.

The county’s Mental Health Court was created in 2001 and has been overseen by four different judges. Overall, the 
program’s successful graduation rate since 2008 has been around 75 percent.

To qualify for the program, a participant must have a persistent, serious mental illness, and be charged with a nonviolent 
felony, or misdemeanor crime. 

The program is designed to divert participants from jail into community-based services that help them to maintain 
treatment, housing and support.

Judge Lazzara is currently working to develop another part of the program that would allow for charges to be reduced or 
ultimately withdrawn upon successful completion.

Statewide, there are currently 26 mental health courts.

Lancaster County court begins 
consumer debt resolution program

Lancaster County Court recently 
began a new program to resolve 
credit card debt cases with the goal 
of bringing debtors and creditors 
together to work out their problems, 
while reducing the burden on the 
court system. 

Through this new program, all cases 
that would have traditionally involved 
litigation will instead go into an 
alternative resolution program that is 
designed to help consumers resolve 
their credit card debt and ultimately 
get on better financial footing. 

Above state averages, credit card 
cases accounted for nearly 16 percent 
of all civil cases in Lancaster County. 

The program works similarly to 
the county’s mortgage foreclosure 
diversion program that started 

back in August where parties will 
be automatically enrolled into the 
program once a court action is filed. 

As part of the program, debtors 
must undergo financial counseling 
while a case management order 
will set the groundwork for parties 
to share information and schedule a 
conciliation conference.

A judge on a mission 

Following a growing number of fights in the beginning of the school year, the 
William Penn School District developed a new program – “Men on a Mission” 
– to bring volunteers from the community into the high school to greet students 
and offer support to encourage a more focused learning environment.

The program started in December following a period of training and approval 
of security clearances. Community leaders lend support and guidance to the 
younger generation and give them some good advice that they can use in 
their personal and professional lives.

One of the community leaders who answered the call to help create a better 
environment for students at Penn Wood High School was Delaware County 
Keith Williams II.
Magisterial District Judge Keith Williams II

“We all must do our part to inspire and to ensure a good future for of our 
children. It is important for young adults to see and to hear success stories,” 
said Judge Williams. 

“As a graduate of Penn Wood High School, Class of 1983, I’m able to relate 
to the students. I share with them my experiences and what steps I took to 
become an attorney and district judge, with the hope of inspiring them.” 

The superintendent said that the program is starting slowly with two shifts 
every day – in the stairs and hallways at the start of school and dismissal.

AOPC/Judicial Operations holds regional 
trainings for DCAs and ADA coordinators 

AOPC/Judicial District Operations recently conducted 
in-person regional trainings for district and deputy court 
administrators, ADA coordinators and others on three 
important topics: Investigations, Performance Evaluations 
Overview, and Mental Health and ADA Accommodations. 

The trainings were offered on three different dates at the 
end of November and beginning of December at three 
locations around the state – Pittsburgh, State College and 
Allentown. 

Led by AOPC is Assistant Chief Counsel of Litigation Geri Geri 
St. Joseph
Robert Krandel, the first 
St. Joseph and Legal Counsel Robert Krandel
part of the training explored the investigation process, 
best practices for conducting an investigation and how to 
document the investigation properly. 

Leah Somers and 
AOPC/Human Resources Analyst Leah Somers
Director of Judicial District Operations Joe Mittleman
Joe Mittleman 
presented the second portion of the training that focused 
on a review of the new automated evaluation system and 
went over the Do’s and Don’ts when writing an effective 
performance evaluation. 

During the final session, AOPC Court Access Coordinator 
Mary Vilter
Mary Vilter and mental health advocate and professor 
Samantha Osterlof discussed how mental disorders and 
illnesses can affect people when they interact with the 
courts and how ADA Coordinators can accommodate 
people with mental health disabilities. 

The trainings were very well attended with over 175 
participants taking part over the course of the three days.

Celebrating Black History Month 

In recognition of Black History Month, 

February provides us with an annual 

opportunity to reflect on how diversity 

on the bench inspires courts and the 

communities they serve. AOPC interviewed 

several judges to learn how their own 

history and experiences have shaped them 

– both as individuals and as judges. Some 

of their answers are highlighted below.

Q: 

How has adversity helped to shape you 
as a judge?

We hope and pray for peace, love and happiness. 
Adversity is guaranteed. However, difficult times 
shape us and give us direction. Adversity can 
lead to progress. We are truly defined by how 
we handle adversity. As a judge, it 
is important to acknowledge that 
difficult circumstances don’t define an 
individual’s entire existence.

Judge Sierra Thomas Street 
Judge Sierra Thomas Street 
Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court

Q: 

What value does a diverse judiciary bring 
to the communities it serves?

Having a diverse judiciary allows the communities 
it serves the perception and hopefully reality that 
when they seek access to the courts, they will have 
a judge who understands their beliefs, struggles, 
plight, way of thinking, upbringing and hope that 
is so important. A diverse bench is fruitful not only 
to the community, but fruitful to the 
bench too, as it allows a sensitivity 
level that otherwise is lost, or 
unknown, resulting in better justice.

Judge Garrett Page  
Judge Garrett Page  
Montgomery County Common Pleas Court

Q: 

Were there any defining moments in your 
life that inspired you to become a jurist?

Yes, I was fortunate enough to have been mentored 
early in my legal career by two giants of the 
Pennsylvania legal profession – Chief Justice 
Robert N.C. Nix, Jr. and Common Pleas Court Judge 
Lawrence Prattis. As a result of my exposure to them 
I decided in 1983, just two years 
after graduating law school, that I 
wanted to become a judge.

Judge Charles Hayden 
Judge Charles Hayden 
Philadelphia County Municipal Court 

Q: 

Growing up, did your family impart 
any lessons/advice that you still carry 
with you today? 

My parents stressed the importance of education 
as essential to opening the doors to opportunity in 
life. They taught me to be a leader 
not a follower, to be principled and 
considerate of others.

Judge George Overton 
Judge George Overton 
Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court 

Q: 

Were there any defining moments in your 
life that inspired you to become a jurist?

My first job after my first year of law school was with 
The Honorable Justin M. Johnson, a distinguished 
African-American jurist who came from a family of 
trail blazers. His chambers were run like a well-oiled 
machine and set the standard for judicial excellence. 
My first job after law school was serving as the law 
clerk to Clarion County President Judge Charles 
Alexander. Judge Alexander was a wonderful 
mentor and set the standard for what a Court of 
Common Pleas Judge should be. Additionally, at a 
pivotal time in my early career, I was the law clerk to 
Butler County President Judge Thomas 
Doerr. Having the opportunity to work 
closely with these judges helped me to 
see this as a possibility for myself.

Q: 

What value does a diverse judiciary bring 
to the communities it serves?

The community at large looks to the judiciary to 
resolve legal issues which are presented in court 
be they civil, criminal or family law based. The 
real advantage of having a diverse judiciary is 
that the judges of different backgrounds have the 
opportunity to talk and share ideas about solutions 
to common problems which may present themselves 
in diverse parts of the community. The 
interaction between the judges may 
result in a new or different perspective 
and may raise awareness of bias 
which was unknown.

Q: 

If you could go back in time and have dinner 
with any person from history, who would it 
be and what would you ask/tell them?

There are so many that I would prefer a dinner party 
and invite, Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, 
President Abraham Lincoln, W.E.B. DuBois, Paul 
Robeson, Honorable Thurgood Marshall, Reverend 
Doctor Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. I 
would thank them all for being relentless in their 
efforts to advocate for and ensure the 
human rights of African slaves and their 
African American descendants. Then I 
would listen to what they would offer.

Q: 

How has adversity helped to shape you 
as a judge?

Every trial and tribulation has made me stronger, 
bolder, wiser and more courageous. I have been 
blessed in my life but the adversity and resulting 
brokenness have forced me to appreciate the 
simple things in life and to look at the glass as half 
full as opposed to half empty. My own unpleasant 
experiences keep me grounded and humble so that 
I can never forget that although I have been charged 
with this duty of “judge”, my view is not so high that 
I cannot see below me. I am so grateful to be able 
to serve others from this position. I truly believe that 
the totality of my life experiences, both 
good and bad, informs the fullness of 
every judicial decision that I make.

Valentine’s Day Weddings in 
Berks County District Court

To celebrate Valentine’s Day, Berks County Magisterial District Judge  
Eric J. Taylor 
Eric J. Taylor was scheduling only weddings. Judge Taylor, the District Judge 
for District Court 23-2-02 serving West Reading and Wyomissing, performed 
eight wedding ceremonies.  

The first wedding was at 10:30 AM and the last was at 3:45 PM.  Some 
of the wedding ceremonies were done in Spanish, as Judge Taylor is not 
conversationally fluent in Spanish but he can passably read Spanish 
weddings scripts.  

“Since often times people are in court under negative 
circumstances, I really enjoy the opportunity to be a part of happy 
moments like these,” Judge Taylor said.

To make the weddings extra special, Judge Taylor and his staff decorated the 
courtroom and had flowers and balloons, and each couple received pretzels 
that looked like brides and grooms.

Hudock says goodbye at Union-Snyder 
Treatment Court ceremony

By Eric Scicchitano | Reprinted with 
permission from the Daily Item 

Eleven participants of the Union-
Snyder County Treatment Courts 
graduated on Dec. 15 during the final 
ceremony retiring President Judge 
Michael Hudock presided over.
Michael Hudock

Graduates and participants, their 
supporters and loved ones plus 
Treatment Court staffers crowded 
the courtroom at the Union 
County Courthouse for the 35th 
Commencement Ceremony.

Hudock spoke of his exit, giving 
thanks and respect to all he worked 
with, but not before focusing on the 
graduates. The judge compared 
Treatment Court participants’ 
experiences with “The Wizard of Oz,” 
saying that in their search for heart, 
brain and courage, they discovered 
they didn’t have to look beyond 
themselves.

The graduates, and those before 
them, had the courage to be 
brutally honest with themselves; 
had the heart to mend damaged 
relationships and create new ones; 
had the mind to make difficult 
decisions daily. There have been 
258 graduates since the program’s 
start.

“You always had it. It was always 
there,” Hudock said.

The Treatment Court program 
opened in 2008. It’s designed as a 
last chance for repeat offenders to 
avoid a state prison term. The goal 
is to thwart recidivism and instill a 
sober lifestyle through intensive 
supervision and access to treatment 
and other social services.

The Union-Snyder program achieved 
national prominence within the 
treatment court community, being 
designated in 2017 as a mentor court 
by the National Association of Drug 
Court Professionals and the U.S. 

President Judge Michael T. Hudock congratulates treatment court graduates on what was 
his last day of presiding over the court program. 

Department of Justice. Its role as a mentor court extends through at least 2023.

During the recent ceremony, a participant approached the podium and took in 
the setting before speaking. He said he never thought he’d be standing there, 

14

having successfully completed the 
program. Like all who would follow 
him, he thanked the probation officers, 
judges and related personnel who 
make up the Treatment Court team.

“I got some time in jail to think 
about why I wanted sobriety,” 
Sharp said, explaining he finally put 
himself ahead of other motivations 
to maintain recovery. “I never had 
support like this.”

Another participant credited the court 
program with saving her life. She said 
she maintained sobriety for 10 years. 
Then, in 2017, she said she relapsed.

“You put me in jail and you saved 
my life,” Fleming told District Judge 
Lori Hackenberg
Lori Hackenberg, who will succeed 
Hudock on the county court bench. 
“Thank God. If I left I don’t think I’d be 
here today.”

Robert Walter said he’d never been to 
rehab. He’d been to jail, though, and 
said he’d only learned how to cook 
crack cocaine and make jailhouse 
liquor. Treatment Court changed him. 
He said he met good people, found 
friends and role models and built and 
developed trust in people.

Recovery doesn’t end with a 
graduation ceremony. Walter said it 
continues indefinitely.

“My recovery is not over. It’s never 
going to be over. It’s something I’ll 
have to work on every day,” Walter 
said.

Guest speaker Jennifer Zampogna 
shared in that sentiment. A former 
dermatologist, Zampogna saw her 
professional career and personal 
life collapse when she became 
addicted to pain medication. She 
was prosecuted by the Pennsylvania 
Attorney General’s Office for writing 
faulty prescriptions for herself. She 
lost her medical license and her 
practice.

And, she’s built back. She’s a recovery 
advocate, speaking at engagements 
like the graduation ceremony 
statewide. She serves as director of 
operations at Lawyers Concerned for 
Lawyers, a nonprofit aiding attorneys, 
judges and their relatives in need of 
peer support and treatment referrals 
for mental health and substance use 
issues. She’s also a member of the 
Pennsylvania Advisory Council on 
Drug and Alcohol Abuse.

Recovery began one step at a time, 
minute by minute, she said. She 
encouraged graduates and current 
participants to consider becoming 
involved in community service that 
interests them.

“You have this privilege to be able 
to do this. Take that opportunity and 
run with it,” Zampogna said before 
emphasizing the commitment needed 
to maintain recovery. “I’m either one 
step closer to enhancing my recovery 
or I’m one step closer to relapse.”

Hudock closed the ceremony and 
reflected on his career. He expressed 
gratitude to all of the graduates, 
thanking them for teaching him 
about resilience, redemption 
and overcoming challenges. He 
thanked Treatment Court staff — 
including coordinator Steve Diehl, 
public defender Brian Ulmer and 
Hackenberg, among them — and his 
own court staff, as well as his wife. 
At times, he became emotional as he 
spoke.

The ceremony closed with a 
slideshow of moments from past 
ceremonies and photos showing 
Hudock celebrating with graduates in 
the courtroom.

AOPC Language Access Coordinator 
Tutors New U.S. Citizen 

As Coordinator for Court Access for the AOPC, Mary Vilter
Mary Vilter spends a 
lot of time on language access issues – and that carries over to her 
life beyond the office. 

For the past 15 months, Mary has tutored an adult English language 
learner (twice a week) through the Volunteer English Program in 
Chester County.

The pair spent about six months of that time preparing Mary’s 
student, Vera, for her citizenship interview with United States 
Citizenship and Immigration Services. 

“It’s certainly been interesting to do the entire tutoring experience 
remotely, screen-sharing all sorts of online ESL resources like 
videos, articles, new learner dictionaries etc.,” Vilter said. 

Despite the circumstances that were made more difficult due to the 
pandemic, Vera passed her citizenship test with flying colors and 
was sworn in as an official U.S. citizen in September. 

“I cannot express how proud I am of Vera, nor how fortunate our 
country is to have her as a new citizen,” she said.

Restoring dignity to human 
trafficking victims and survivors 

Written by Amy Kehner, AOPC Judicial Programs administrator and Jamie Pizzi, Esq., STOP grant consultant

The pervasive, worldwide issue of human trafficking is 
of great concern to judicial, legislative, and executive 
officials throughout Pennsylvania.

Traffickers are predators who use a wide range of tactics, 
such as coercion and deception, to exploit vulnerable 
people − including children – to gain illicit profits. 
Tragically, victims may be required to perform sexual acts 
or participate in forced labor. The mental and emotional 
fallout from the mistreatment is especially severe in 
children.

Unlike most crimes with distinct victims and perpetrators, 
people exploited by traffickers are likely to commit crimes 
of their own due to their victimization. For example, sex-
trafficking victims are frequently arrested and charged 
with prostitution, and labor-trafficking victims often lack 
proper visas and are sent into removal proceedings. 
Indeed, what can appear as routine interactions with the 
legal system may be evidence of trafficking victimization. 

Because intimidation, language barriers, and 
socioeconomic vulnerabilities can impede cooperation 
with law enforcement, court-case statistics offer only 
a limited perspective about the scale of the criminal 
activity involved. These sorts of factors also complicate 
prosecutions even when victims recognize their exploiters 
as criminals and are willing and able to come forward. 
Consistent with these concerns, since Pennsylvania 
enacted its current anti-trafficking law in 2014, of the 222 
human trafficking cases filed only 125 of the 831 trafficking 
related charges resulted in a conviction. 

To combat a crime as insidious as human trafficking, it is 
important to recognize victims as victims, even when they 
have become ensnared in the criminal justice system. Key 
remedial measures include collaboration among state and 
local partners, increased awareness through education, 
and utilization of tools provided by law to meet the needs 
of the survivors served by the justice system. 

The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) 
provides training and resources to judges and court-
related staff through a federal STOP (Services, Training, 
Officers, and Prosecutors) Violence Against Women grant. 
Programming focuses on strengthening the court’s ability 
to identify and respond to victims of human trafficking 
by providing law updates and best practices to improve 
outcomes and minimize trauma. AOPC recently developed 
a virtual tool that includes information about identifying 
human trafficking with links to resources to help readers 
understand this highly complex and nuanced crime.

Pennsylvania has several human trafficking laws that 
provide tools for the court to assist victims and survivors. 
The Safe Harbor for Sexually Exploited Children law forbids 
minors from being charged with prostitution and dictates 
that sexually exploited children be provided with services, 
rather than placed in delinquency proceedings. The 
vacatur provision of the Commonwealth’s anti-trafficking 
law creates a mechanism for trafficking survivors to vacate 
certain trafficking-related convictions. 

Senator Katie Muth recently introduced SB 1009 – 
“Expanding Post-Conviction Relief for Victims of Human 
Trafficking” – to expand the current vacatur provisions by 
adding two new eligible offenses and providing the court 
with exclusive authority to decide whether a conviction 
was trafficking-related. For survivors with a criminal record, 
vacatur may present an opportunity to remove barriers 
to gainful employment, housing, education, financial 
assistance and other critical resources that reduce the 
likelihood of revictimization. The remedy also provides a 
chance for survivors whose victimization predates human 
trafficking laws to remove a painful reminder of the past.

As reflected above, although human trafficking often 
occurs in the open, it remains difficult to redress. Being 
proactive in confronting systemic hurdles and utilizing 
tools like vacatur offers survivors the opportunity to 
recover. Building on the existing resources, and with a 
commitment to create other effective tools, the judiciary 
can be an agent of change in restoring dignity to human 
trafficking victims and survivors in Pennsylvania.

JURY SIZE: DOES IT MATTER? 

Reprinted with permission from the National Center for State 
Courts newsletter – @ the Center. 

Do smaller juries allow for more unanimous verdicts? Are they representative of their communities? Are they more cost 
effective? 

These and other questions are posed in a recently released report by NCSC researcher Erica Boyce called Time to 
Reflect: Has the research changed regarding the importance of jury size?

The pandemic has made it more difficult to empanel juries, and the American Board of Trial Advocates asked NCSC’s 
Center for Jury Studies to review the empirical research conducted on jury size during the past 20 years. Boyce said 
recent research tended to mirror previous findings and did not always help answer whether 12-member juries are better 
or worse than smaller juries.

The 12-person jury, which the American Bar Association supports, is used by 33 states for civil jury trials, 34 for 
misdemeanor trials and 45 for non-capital felony trials. Other states use six-, seven- or eight-member juries for those 
trials.

Boyce said the most recent research continues to highlight the complexity of the issue, and her report presents that 
complexity in these findings:

Some research says reducing jury sizes saves money for courts and for litigants with lawyers, but other research 
says the savings are minimal.

Jury service is sacrificial, forcing jurors to lose wages and time from family, so smaller juries mean fewer people 
have to make those sacrifices. But other research says people who serve on juries develop a greater appreciation for 
the justice system, so smaller juries mean fewer people will experience that appreciation.

It’s easier to reach consensus in smaller juries, some research shows, but they’re less likely to include diverse 
viewpoints, and larger, 12-person juries often possess a better collective memory when they adjourn to review 
testimony and evidence.

• 

Smaller juries are often less diverse and less likely to accurately represent their communities.

Boyce concluded that future research should rely on court and juror data as well as predictive models.

“Since pros and cons are associated with 12-person juries as well as smaller ones,” she said, “I would encourage states 
to weigh all of the research before they make decisions about what size jury works best for them.”
