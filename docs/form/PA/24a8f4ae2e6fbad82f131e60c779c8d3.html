EFORE:  HONORABLE RENÉE COHN JUBELIRER, President Judge

PINION NOT REPORTED 

EMORANDUM OPINION BY 

PRESIDENT JUDGE COHN JUBELIRER   

FILED:  March 22, 2023 

Thomas Miller (Claimant) petitions for review of a February 2, 2022 Order of 

the  Workers’  Compensation  Appeal  Board  (Board)  that  affirmed  the  February  1, 

2021 Decision of a Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ), granting the Modification 

Petition  filed  by  Prospectus  Associates,  Inc.  (Employer).    Claimant  argues  the 

impairment  rating  evaluation  (IRE)  upon  which  the  modification  was  based  was 

performed  pursuant  to  an  unconstitutional  law,  namely  Section  306(a.3)  of  the 

Workers’ Compensation Act (Act),1  which was added by Section 1 of the Act of 

October 24, 2018, P.L. 714, No. 111 (Act 111).  Claimant also argues it was error to 

award Employer credit for any periods of total or partial disability prior to enactment 

1 Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. § 511.3.  Section 306(a.3) was added by 

Section 1 of the Act of October 24, 2018, P.L. 714, No. 111 (Act 111).

of Act 111, given his work injury predates Act 111.  Consistent with this Court’s 

precedent, we hold Act 111 is not constitutionally infirm and Employer was entitled 

to credit pursuant to Act 111.  Accordingly, we affirm the Board’s Order.  

The  pertinent  facts  of  this  matter  are  not  disputed.    On  April  22,  2010, 

Claimant suffered a work-related injury, specifically a cervical disc herniation at C5-

6  and  C6-7,  in  the  course  and  scope  of  his  employment  with  Employer.    On 

November  26,  2019,  Employer  filed  the  Modification  Petition  seeking  to  have 

Claimant’s  benefits  changed  from  temporary  total  disability  to  temporary  partial 

disability  based  upon  an  IRE  performed  by  Scott  Naftulin,  D.O.,  on  October  21, 

2019.  Dr. Naftulin opined that Claimant reached maximum medical improvement 

and,  using  the  American  Medical  Association’s  Guides  to  the  Evaluation  of 

Permanent  Impairment,  sixth  edition,  second  printing,  (Guides),  concluded 

Claimant’s whole-person impairment was eight percent.   

Before the WCJ, Claimant did not offer any medical evidence to challenge the 

impairment rating.  Instead, Claimant argued the Modification Petition should be 

denied because Claimant had yet to receive 104 weeks of total disability as required 

by Act 111.  In addition, Claimant argues that Act 111 was unconstitutional.    

The  WCJ  found  the  testimony  and  opinion  expressed  by  Dr.  Naftulin  was 

“credible, convincing[,] and persuasive.”  (WCJ Finding of Fact ¶ 2.)  Accordingly, 

the WCJ concluded Employer met its burden of proof and granted the Modification 

Petition,  changing  Claimant’s  status  from  temporary  total  disability  to  temporary 

partial  disability  as of  October  21,  2019,  the date  of  the  IRE.   (WCJ’s  Decision, 

Conclusion of Law (COL) ¶ 2 & Order.)  In doing so, the WCJ rejected Claimant’s 

argument about the constitutionality of Act 111 as having already been decided and, 

concluded  that,  pursuant  to  Act 111,  Employer  was  entitled  to  credit  for  the  104 

2 

weeks of temporary total disability previously paid, as well as credit for any periods 

of partial disability Employer previously paid.  (COL ¶¶ 2-3 & Order.)  

Claimant  appealed  to  the  Board,  arguing  Act  111  was  an  unconstitutional 

delegation of legislative power.  Claimant further argued that applying Act 111 to 

him was unconstitutional as his injury predated its enactment.  In addition, Claimant 

argued that 104 weeks had not passed between Act 111’s enactment and the filing 

of  the  Modification  Petition,  rendering  it  premature.    Lastly,  Claimant  argued 

Employer should not  receive  credit  for  any weeks  of  partial  disability  previously 

paid.2  The Board explained that it, similar to the WCJ, “cannot declare a provision 

of the Act to be unconstitutional[,]” as it is outside the Board’s jurisdiction.  (Board 

Op.  at  4.)    Notwithstanding,  the  Board  noted  it  can  apply  the  holdings  of 

Pennsylvania  appellate  courts,  which  have  addressed  the  constitutionality  of  Act 

111.    (Id.)    Citing  Pennsylvania  AFL-CIO  v.  Commonwealth,  219  A.3d  306  (Pa. 

Cmwlth.  2019),  aff’d,  (Pa.,  No.  88  MAP  2019,  filed  Aug.  18,  2020),  the  Board 

concluded this Court already determined that Act 111 was not an unconstitutional 

delegation  of  legislative  power.    (Board  Op.  at  4.)    Citing  Rose  Corporation  v. 

Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Espada), 238 A.3d 551 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020), 

the Board concluded that while an IRE performed before the enactment of Act 111 

could  not  be  used  to  modify  a  claimant’s  benefits,  an  IRE  performed  after  and 

consistent with  Section 306(a.3)  could,  and  pursuant to  Section 3 of  Act 111,  an 

employer was entitled to credit for past payments.  (Board Op. at 4-5.)  Finally, the 

Board cited Pierson v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Consol Pennsylvania 

 

2 The Board noted that it was “unclear from the record” when Claimant’s disability status 
was previously modified from total to partial, but “the parties seem to agree that Claimant received 
partial disability benefits for some period of time.”  (Board’s Op. at 3 n.3.)  Like the Board, the 
Court finds the lack of specific dates does not impact its analysis.   

3 

Coal Company LLC), 252 A.3d 1169 (Pa. Cmwlth.), petition for allowance of appeal 

denied,  261  A.3d  378  (Pa.  2021),  for  the  conclusion  that  Act  111  is  not 

unconstitutional  on  its  face.    (Board  Op.  at  5.)    Therefore,  the  Board  rejected 

Claimant’s arguments and affirmed the WCJ’s Decision.  

Thereafter, Claimant filed a timely Petition for Review.  Before this Court,3 

Claimant  argues,  as  he  did  before  the  WCJ  and  Board,  that  Act  111  is  an 

unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, that the IRE was invalid because 

Claimant had not yet been paid 104 weeks of total disability benefits after Act 111 

was enacted, that his injury predates Act 111 and therefore it cannot apply to his 

injury, and that Employer should not receive credit for any periods of disability (total 

or partial) paid prior to Act 111’s enactment.  Claimant appears to recognize that the 

Court has previously rejected similar arguments but asserts the “Court’s opinions for 

all practical purposes have given life back to [former] Section 306(a.2) of the Act,” 

formerly 77 P.S. § 511.2,4 which was the IRE provision found unconstitutional by 

the Supreme Court in Protz v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Derry Area 

School District), 161 A.3d 827 (Pa. 2017), “and have thereby permitted employers 

and their workers’ compensation insurance carriers the benefit once again of that 

unconstitutional provision.”  (Claimant’s Brief at 8-9.)  Claimant also argues Act 

 

3 Our review is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether 
errors of law were committed, or whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial 
evidence.  Universal Am-Can, Ltd. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd. (Minteer), 762 A.2d 328, 331 
n.2 (Pa. 2000).   

4 Former Section 306(a.2) was added by Section 4 of the Act of June 24, 1996, P.L. 350, 

formerly 77 P.S. § 511.2, repealed by Act 111.

111 violates injured workers’ vested rights in violation of the Remedies Clause of 

article I, section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. I, § 11.5   

 

Employer responds that this Court has rejected these same arguments in AFL-

CIO,  Pierson,  and  more  recently,  Hutchinson  v.  Annville  Township  (Workers’ 

Compensation  Appeal  Board),  260  A.3d  360  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  2021).    Given  this 

precedent, Employer asks the Court to affirm the Board’s Order.  

The  history  of  former  Section  306(a.2)  and  the  subsequent  enactment  of 

Section  306(a.3)  through  Act  111  has  been  thoroughly  explained  in  numerous 

decisions of this Court.  Thus, an exhaustive overview of that history is not needed 

here.  It is sufficient to say that Act 111 largely reenacted the IRE provisions found 

in  former  Section  306(a.2),6  and  claimants,  employers,  and  insurers  have  been 

testing the parameters of the Supreme Court’s decision in Protz and the Legislature’s 

subsequent  enactment  of  Act  111/Section  306(a.3)  ever  since.    However,  the 

arguments raised by Claimant here have been raised by other claimants in the past 

and have consistently been rejected, as the Board correctly recognized.  

First,  in  AFL-CIO,  we  held  Act  111,  unlike  its  predecessor,  was  not  an 

unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.  219 A.3d at 319.  In Pierson, 

we  rejected  an  argument  identical  to  Claimant’s  argument  here  that  the  IRE  he 

underwent was premature  because fewer than 104 weeks  had passed between the 

 

5 The Remedies Clause provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ll courts shall be open; and every 
man for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due 
course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay . . . .”  PA. CONST. 
art. I, § 11.  

6 Act 111 differed from its predecessor in a few regards.  First, it specified that IREs were 
to be performed using the sixth edition, second printing April 2009 version of the Guides, instead 
of “the most recent edition of the . . . Guides,” as the former IRE provision did.  Compare 77 P.S. 
§ 511.3, with former 77 P.S. § 511.2.  Second, claimants are now presumed to be totally disabled 
if their impairment rating is greater than or equal to 35%, whereas under the former IRE provision, 
the threshold was 50%.  Compare 77 P.S. § 511.3(2), with former 77 P.S. § 511.2(2).

enactment of Act 111 and the IRE.  In that case, the claimant underwent an IRE and 

had his disability status modified to partial after the enactment of Act 111.  Citing 

Rose Corporation, the Court explained that Act 111 plainly provides for credit of 

weeks of temporary total and partial disability benefits previously paid and that the 

General  Assembly  explicitly  provided  the  credit  provisions  were  to  be  given 

retroactive effect.  Pierson, 252 A.3d at 1179-80.  Rose Corporation also holds that 

the  plain  language  of  Section  3  of  Act  111  explicitly  gives  employers  credit  for 

previous  weeks  of  disability  benefits  paid.    238  A.3d  at  563.    The  claimant  in 

Pierson, like Claimant here, also asserted the vested rights argument, which was also 

rejected.  The Court held that the claimant’s “‘vested rights’ have not been abrogated 

by Act 111,” id. at 1180, because “there are reasonable expectations under the Act 

that  benefits  may  change,”  id.  at  1179.    We  explained  that  Act  111  did  not 

automatically strip a claimant of any rights; rather, Act 111 provided employers with 

a mechanism to modify a claimant’s disability status from total to partial.   Id.  In 

Hutchinson, the Court reaffirmed these holdings.  260 A.3d at 366-67.  We note that 

other claimants have invited the Court to revisit these holdings, but we have declined 

to do so.  See, e.g., Sochko v. Nat’l Express Transit Serv. (Workers’ Comp. Appeal 

Bd.) (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 490 C.D. 2021, filed March 16, 2022), slip op. at 9-10, 13; 

Hender-Moody v. Am. Heritage Fed. Credit Union (Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd.) 

(Pa. Cmwlth., No. 166 C.D. 2021, filed February 15, 2022), slip op. at 5-7; and Dohn 

v. Beck N’ Call (Workers’ Comp. Appeal Bd.) (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 103 C.D. 2021, 

filed Sept. 20, 2021), slip op. at 9-10.7   

 

7 Unreported panel decisions of this Court may be cited for their persuasive value pursuant 
to  Rule  126(b)(1)  of  the  Pennsylvania  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure,  Pa.R.A.P.  126(b)(1),  and 
Section 414(a) of this Court’s Internal Operating Procedures, 210 Pa. Code § 69.414(a).

Because our analysis in those cases is directly applicable and controlling, we 

affirm the Board’s Order.
