1  |  2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging

Executive Summary 

The mission of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging (PDA) is to promote independence, purpose and 
well-being in the lives of older adults through advocacy, service and protection. This mission drove the 
development of our federally required four-year state plan on aging. The plan keeps the present and 
future needs of Pennsylvania’s growing and diversifying population of older adults and their caregivers 
at the forefront. The department seeks to both honor and recognize the lives of more than 3 million 
adults over 60 years old who call Pennsylvania home by completing the goals, objectives and strategies 
outlined in this plan.

The development of the plan was accomplished with input, cooperation and support from the public, 
stakeholders and other state agencies who support our mission. Among our primary collaborators were 
the Pennsylvania Council on Aging (PCoA), the Pennsylvania Association of Area Agencies on Aging 
(P4A), and our statewide network of 52 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), all of whom support the needs 
of older adults within their respective communities.

We have many unique opportunities to be innovative in our approach to programming, advocacy and 
service for older adults in Pennsylvania, not only during this four-year plan, but well beyond. From 
changing the narrative around what it means to grow older to leveraging the experience and wisdom of 
our diverse and talented older adult population in order to combat ageism. We look to our many part-
nerships to help enliven the spirit of community for Pennsylvanians of all ages and to support our vision 
of a commonwealth where older adults are embraced and empowered to live and age with dignity and 
respect.

Over the next four years, PDA will strategically focus its efforts on the following five overarching goals 
in order to position Pennsylvania to meet the needs of and enhance services for older adults:

Goal One: Strengthen aging network’s capacity, promote innovation and best practices, and build effi-
ciencies to respond to the growing and diversifying aging population.

Goal Two: Improve services for older adults and the ability to advocate for them by using evidence-in-
formed planning, committing to data integrity and being accountable for results.

Goal Three: Establish and enhance efforts to support healthy living, active engagement and a sense of 
community for all older Pennsylvanians.

Goal Four: Emphasize a citizen-first culture that provides outreach, embraces diversity, and honors 
individual choice.

Goal Five: Advocate for the rights of older adults and ensure their safety and dignity by raising aware-
ness of and responding effectively to incidences of abuse, injury, exploitation, violence and neglect.

Currently, one in four Pennsylvanians is over 60 years old. This older adult population is expected to 
reach 4 million, nearly one-third of the total population, by 2030 and remain at that level through 2040. 
While a smaller part of the total population, those 85 years and older, represents a subgroup that is ex-
pected to continue growing steadily to nearly 610,000 in 2040. Among the special concerns of a rising 
85-and-older population is the greater prevalence of comorbidities and higher rate of disability, which 
will increase the demand for home and community-based services.

In addition to the growth of Pennsylvania’s older adult population, it is also becoming more diverse. 
Currently, diverse racial and ethnic groups make up only 12% of the 65-and-older population in PA; 
however, those numbers are expected to grow to 22% by 2050. Hispanics, currently a little over 2% of 
this population, are projected to experience the highest increase in older adults and reach 7% by 2050. 
These projections highlight the importance of continuing to focus on person-centered, culturally com-
petent services and outreach to diverse communities in order to be responsive to the needs of every-
one seeking services.

2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging  |  2

The increasing diversity in our population further extends to the LGBTQ community. The unique needs 
of LGBTQ older adults must be thoughtfully considered in our planning. Although data is still largely 
unavailable, we recognize our responsibility to be responsive to the needs of this growing sector of the 
aging community. We can be responsive by ensuring welcoming spaces, culturally-affirming services, 
and taking the steps necessary to allow these and all older individuals to age with the dignity and re-
spect that every person deserves.

To address the needs of Pennsylvania’s growing and diversifying older adult population, PDA needs to 
remain agile in its ability to respond to emerging trends and to stand ready to advocate for our most 
vulnerable residents. Supporting measures that allow for increased access to telehealth, telemedicine 
and socialization via technology are examples of ways we can help to improve access to health care and 
social services and to reduce social isolation, which are issues addressed by older adults who answered 
the State Plan on Aging 2020–2024 Community and Stakeholder Survey.

Social isolation of older adults is a significant concern because of the negative effect it can have 
on overall health and emotional well-being.  Establishing innovative ways to reduce social isolation 
through new or existing technologies and strategic partnerships is important to impact the very real 
innate human need of simply connecting with others. 

The State Plan on Aging 2020–2024 Community and Stakeholder Survey further validated this point 
when we asked participants to rate 14 factors in terms of importance to age-friendly communities.  
Rating fourth behind predictably high scoring areas like affordable housing, access to in-home services 
and affordable prescriptions was “opportunities to make meaningful connections with others,” reinforc-
ing the need for continued work in this area.

Older adults who are socially isolated are also more susceptible to abuse, neglect, violence, and finan-
cial exploitation and scams perpetrated by people who are either known or unknown to them. Older 
adult protective services, which are overseen by PDA and carried out by AAAs in local communities, are 
the most urgent and critical services we provide. Reports of need for protective services have increased 
97% in the past five years. This rise in reports is due in part to the growing population, but also commu-
nity awareness efforts and targeted training and collaboration with other state agencies and partners. 
The trend of increasing reports of need is expected to continue and serves to highlight the need for the 
department to stay vigilant in the important role we serve in developing policy, providing oversight and 
promoting advocacy of this critical program serving the most vulnerable older Pennsylvanians.

Protective services and other programs administered by PDA, through the AAAs, are financed largely 
by the state lottery and federal funds. Pennsylvania has the distinct advantage of being the only state 
where all proceeds of the state lottery are for programs that benefit older residents. This significant 
infusion of funds each year helps to support major programs like prescription assistance, reduced-fare 
and free transit services, property tax and rent rebate programs, and home and community-based 
services. The state lottery system is critically important in helping to serve and meet the needs of older 
Pennsylvanians.  

Commonwealth residents have resources available to assist them as they age whether they are older 
adults, caregivers of older adults, grandparents raising grandchildren, persons living with a disability, or 
older veterans. This State Plan on Aging provides a comprehensive roadmap to improve access to and 
the quality of services for older adults. PDA is committed to working tirelessly to implement this plan to 
improve quality of life and well-being for all older adults.

3  |  2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging

Introduction & Context

PDA was created by Pennsylvania’s Act 70 of 1978, which established “a cabinet-level State agency 
whose jurisdiction, powers, and duties specifically concern and are directed to advancing the well- 
being of Pennsylvania’s older citizens.” It further established that PDA would “serve as an advocate for 
the aging at all levels of government.” 

As the State Unit on Aging (SUA) for Pennsylvania, PDA provides the strategic vision and leadership 
to develop and administer programs and services to meet the many unique needs of older adults and 
their caregivers through a network of 52 local AAAs. In addition to administering state and federal 
funding to the AAAs and ensuring adherence to contract requirements, PDA also provides policy guid-
ance, programmatic structure, data collection systems management, technical assistance, quality assur-
ance and training.

PDA, as the SUA, is federally required by the Older Americans Act (OAA) of 1965, as amended, to sub-
mit a state plan on aging to the Administration for Community Living (ACL) at the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) at least once every four years. Local AAAs are similarly required to 
develop area plans for their local planning and service area which align with the state plan both in tim-
ing and, while keeping local needs in mind, content. Area plans undergo a similar development process 
to the state plan and are submitted to PDA for review and approval.

As part of the state plan development process, PDA must ensure the steps taken to create the state plan 
and the execution of the plan over the next four years adhere to assurances required by ACL. For the 
development of the state plan, this includes things like conducting a needs assessment, ensuring we 
seek public input on our plan, developing plan goals that align with the four focus areas identified by 
ACL and allowing for public feedback on the state plan draft. For the execution of the plan, it includes a 
promise that the department will adhere to its programmatic obligations under the OAA and be ac-
countable to our plan by having measurable outcomes and transparently reporting results.

This plan is the product of a development process that began as an internal strategic planning meeting 
amongst the leadership team at PDA in mid-2019 and grew through the input of our staff, valued stake-
holders and the public to be a robust, living, 2020-2024 strategy for the department.

State Unit on Aging Operations Overview

In conjunction with administering the OAA and ACL discretionary grants, PDA coordinates a compre-
hensive array of services that benefit older Pennsylvanians, their families, their caregivers, and the aging 
network. These services are made available primarily through the network of 52 local AAAs across the 
commonwealth. With guidance from the department, AAAs are responsible for planning, developing, 
and implementing a system of services for persons age 60 and over in their respective PSAs. 

In addition to the AAAs, the aging network includes senior community centers, adult daily living cen-
ters, Aging and Disability Resources Centers (ADRCs), direct care workers and other providers. These 
partners are crucial to the delivery of services and the well-being of older Pennsylvanians. 

By recognizing the importance of our internal and external partnerships and leveraging resources 
through discretionary grants and other funding sources, we are continually striving to expand our  
capacity to serve older adults in new and innovative ways.

Population

Pennsylvania’s rapidly growing older adult population is also growing enriched with diversity, making 
the commonwealth a desirable place to live and age. Currently, one in four Pennsylvanians is over 60 
years old, but in the next 10 years, the population shift is expected to be such that nearly one-third of 
our population will be over 60 years old.

While the 60-and-older population swells to nearly 4 million people and is estimated to hold rather 
steady for a number of years after 2030, there is expected to be a marked, steady increase in the 85 
years old and older age group. In fact, it is expected the number of the oldest older adults (85+) in 2040 
will be double the number there were in 2010. Projected increases in the oldest older adult (85+) are 
important to consider in our plans because they are more likely to be living with multiple health condi-
tions or disabilities. They are also more likely to live alone and be at risk for social isolation.

The growing older adult population is also becoming more diverse. This changing demographic is 
adding the experience and wisdom of older adults of different races, ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds, 
sexual orientations and gender identities. At the PDA, our first core value is “diversity and inclusion 
strengthen us,” so meeting the needs of our diversifying older adult population is an exciting challenge 
and opportunity. It will require us to continue to develop services that reach, speak and are responsive 
to every older Pennsylvanian who needs them.

PDA recognizes another layer of diversity includes the varying level of ability of each individual. Older 
adults live with disabilities at a much higher rate than adults 18-59, often with co-occurring conditions. 
Living with disabilities can make it difficult to access needed services and participate in opportunities 
like volunteerism, senior centers and other activities.

Programs & Funding

Older adults in Pennsylvania have access to a variety of aging programs and services funded by state 
and federal resources. A distinct advantage for older adults in the commonwealth is that our program-
ming receives a significant amount of funding through the state lottery.

The Pennsylvania Lottery is the only state lottery that designates all of its proceeds to programs that 
benefit older residents. Thanks to loyal PA Lottery players, the PA Lottery has been able to contrib-
ute more than $30 billion to programs for older adults since the lottery began in 1972. In 2019, the 
Pennsylvania Lottery generated more than $1 billion in PA Lottery benefits for those programs, many 
of which would not exist without this funding. These include property tax and rent rebates, free and 
reduced-fare transit services, low-cost prescription drug programs, and an array of home and commu-
nity-based services.

Specific to PDA’s programs and services, which do not include PA Department of Human Services 
Medicaid-funded home and community-based services for older adults and nursing facility care, our 
funding is as follows: For fiscal year 2020-21, the lottery generated $463,795,000 toward services and 
supports for older Pennsylvanians. This represents 81% of the total budget for PDA-administered pro-
grams and services. PDA’s budget also included $104,717,000 in federal funding and $796,000 in other 
augmentations.

PDA allocates state and federal funding to PSAs across the commonwealth through allocations to AAAs 
calculated by an Intrastate Funding Formula approved by ACL. The weighted formula takes into consid-
eration the population of older adults who are of greatest economic and social need. In particular, the 
formula considers the following factors: Low-income persons 60 years and older (at or below 100% of 
poverty), rural population 60 years and older, minority persons 60 years old and older, persons 75 years 
old and older, and persons 60 years old and older. The term “block grant” refers to state funds and not 
federal funds throughout this document.

Grant Funding

In addition to state and federal funding, PDA seeks ACL and other discretionary grants in order to 
develop innovative programs that allow us to expand our capacity, strengthen the aging network, and 
better serve Pennsylvania’s older adults and those living with a disability.

The following are current grant initiatives at PDA:

Aging and Disability Resources Center Grant

The ADRC, also known as PA Link, was awarded a $3 million grant in April 2020 from HHS-ACL to sup-
port capacity and resource allocation for the PA Link at the state and local level in its efforts to prevent, 
prepare for and respond to COVID-19. All activities within the scope of the grant will be completed 
within the performance period, which ends in September 2021.

Funded activities include:

•	

Implementing e-services for PA Link staff and consumers to assist and overcome challenges 
related to accessing PA Link programs

•	 Supporting those most at risk in seeking transitional support from hospital-to-home and nurs-

ing home-to-home by using aging network supports

•	 Collaborating with local grocery stores, restaurants, mobile food ordering and delivery services 

to provide groceries to consumers in need

•	 Assisting older adults, people with disabilities, caregivers and clinicians to understand how to 
use telehealth technologies to provide and receive needed services and to reduce social isola-
tion

•	 Providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for PA Link partners to ensure in-home supports 

can be maintained

•	

Increasing public awareness of the PA Link helpline

•	 Providing consumers with the ability to request periodic check-in calls by trained staff and 

increase awareness of consumers to low-cost programs that connect individuals through broad-
band and telecommunication equipment

•	 Assisting the PA Link network partners to respond to requests from consumers in need of  

resource information and assistance

Protective Services Office Grant

The Protective Services Office was awarded a $1.568 million grant in September 2018 from ACL to col-
laborate with Pennsylvania Department of Health’s Community Health Nurses to enhance services for 
older adults at risk of or found to be neglecting their own care needs and provide a multi-faceted ap-
proach to reducing identified risks. All activities within the scope of the grant will be completed within 
the performance period, which ends in August 2021.

Funded activities include:

•	 Providing person-centered one-on-one health education from a community health nurse to 

older adults at risk of, or who are currently neglecting their own care needs 

9  |  2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging

•	 Educating older adults and the general public about elder abuse and reporting and available 

community programs designed to assist them in maintaining their health and wellness

Protective Services Office Grant

The Protective Services Office was awarded a $600,000 grant in September 2019 as a subgrantee from 
the PA Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD) Office for Victims of Crime to enhance the deliv-
ery of protective services for older adults through technology. All activities within the scope of the grant 
will be completed within the performance period, which ends in August 2021.

Funded activities include:

•	 Development and implementation of an online protective services report of need to increase 

access for the public to report elder abuse electronically

•	 Development of an electronic data dashboard designed to assist investigative staff to most 

efficiently manage the needs of victims in accordance with Pennsylvania’s Older Adult Protective 
Services Act (OAPSA)

•	 Enhancement of the functionality of the statewide Elder Abuse Reporting Hotline (1-800-490-

8505)

Councils and Workgroups

The department has several councils that we consider to be key partners in advancing efforts on legisla-
tion, policy discussions, advocacy and more. They advise the department on current trends within older 
adult serving systems of care and provide recommendations on emerging issues.

Pennsylvania Council on Aging

The Pennsylvania Council on Aging (PCoA) was created in 1977 by Pennsylvania Statutes Title 71 State 
Government § 581-4 (Administrative Code § 2204-A). The 21 members who make up the council (the 
majority of whom are required to be age 60 or older) are nominated by the governor and subject to 
Senate confirmation. Five members of the council serve as chairs of five separate regional councils.  
Council members represent all older Pennsylvanians and serve as advocates for older adults and advise 
the governor and the department on planning, coordination, and delivery of services to older adults. 

Pennsylvania Long-Term Care Council

The Pennsylvania Long-Term Care Council (LTCC) was established by Act 64 of 2015, replacing the In-
tra-Governmental Council on Long-Term Care in order to reflect today’s broader long-term care con-
tinuum. Chaired by the Secretary of Aging, the council is comprised of 35 members appointed by the 
governor, in consultation with the Secretary of Aging, including long-term care consumers, advocates, 
caregivers, providers, and policymakers. The LTCC consults with various departments and agencies 
to make recommendations on regulations, licensure, financing, or any other responsibilities of those 
departments or agencies relating to long-term care. The council’s scope includes all areas of long-term 
care, including, but not limited to, institutional care and home and community-based services. 

Cultural Diversity Advisory Council 

The Cultural Diversity Advisory Council advises PDA on developing and sustaining a network of pro-
viders and services that are culturally sensitive, responsive, and inclusive to the diverse needs of Penn-
sylvania’s older adults. The council is comprised of AAA representatives and stakeholders from diverse 
backgrounds and perspectives. 

2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging  |  10

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) Task Force

The ADRD Task Force was established in 2018. It was created to take a lead role in implementing the 
goals and recommendations of the Pennsylvania State Plan for ADRD. The objectives of the Task Force 
include:

•	 Working with local organizations, entities, advocates, and other stakeholders to identify and 
share best practices that support the goals and overall success of the ADRD State Plan at the 
local level

•	 Developing and facilitating the actions needed to carry out the recommendations and goals of 

the ADRD State Plan

•	 Encouraging research and reviewing any other issues that are relevant to ADRD
•	 Assisting in planning the annual ADRD Forum
•	 Leading efforts to review and revise the ADRD State Plan, as necessary

Task force members represent a diverse group of individuals and organizations from across the com-
monwealth. Its members include individuals and families living with ADRD, representatives from the 
Alzheimer’s Association, consumer advocacy groups, long-term care organizations, and other profes-
sionals. The ADRD Task Force is comprised of a chair and 15 members and meets at least quarterly.

Collaborative Engagement with other Commissions & Councils

Governor’s Commissions 

As part of the Administration’s promise of a commonwealth committed to providing equality and 
opportunity for all its citizens, there are several commissions that advocate for and advise the Admin-
istration on the unique needs of diverse communities. Pennsylvania currently has five commissions: 
Commission on African American Affairs, Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs, Commission 
on Latino Affairs, Commission on LGBTQ Affairs (established by Governor Tom Wolf and the first in the 
nation), and Commission for Women. Members of the commissions are appointed by the governor and 
have representation across the state. 

PDA has developed well-established relationships with several commissions and consider them a valued 
resource in helping the department reach out and build trust within their communities.  Commissions 
are a resource to PDA to ensure our outreach connects us with OAA targeted groups. A powerful exam-
ple of these partnerships is the relationship built with the PA Commission on LGBTQ Affairs. This com-
mission has an aging workgroup that includes a participating representative from PDA. This relationship 
has allowed for many collaborations, as well as sharing of information including the submission of 
formal recommendations to PDA to help inform this plan.

PA Supreme Court Advisory Council on Elder Justice in the Courts

The Advisory Council on Elder Justice in the Courts was established in 2015 to advise the Office of Elder 
Justice in the Courts regarding the implementation of the Elder Law Task Force’s Report and Recom-
mendations regarding best practices, judicial rules, and legislation to benefit elder citizens of the com-
monwealth. The mission of the Advisory Council on Elder Justice in the Courts is to identify and address 
elder justice issues affecting the commonwealth’s elders. As part of their roles at PDA, both the Secre-
tary of Aging and Chief Counsel are among the 24 members of this Council, which strategizes around 
elder justice matters such as guardianship, grandfamilies rights, protective services and others at their 
quarterly meetings.

Other Department of Aging Initiatives

University of Pennsylvania Behavioral Health Lab Partnership

To comprehensively serve beneficiaries of the Department’s Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the 
Elderly (PACE), the program partners with the University of Pennsylvania to provide evidence-based, 
algorithm-driven services through the university’s Behavioral Health Lab (BHL) program.

The Behavioral Health Lab program seeks to address depression, anxiety, and dementia, which are prev-
alent later in life and lead to significant morbidity and disability, thereby contributing to increased use 
of medical services, nursing home utilization, and mortality.

The BHL program has three arms:

•	 Supporting Seniors Receiving Treatment and Intervention (SUSTAIN) – outreaches to cardholders 

•	 Caregiver Resources, Education, and Support (CREST) – addresses the needs of caregivers of 

with depression or anxiety problems

cardholders with dementing illnesses

•	 High Dose Opioid Program (HDO) – provides cardholders with an innovative approach to man-

aging chronic pain and addressing the unmet psychosocial needs that contribute to the cycle of 
chronic pain

Emerging Issues and Trends

COVID-19 and the Future of Service Delivery 

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the development of this four-year state plan, and 
its impact on older adults, has elevated the importance of the key services provided by SUAs and the 
AAAs. The delivery of nutrition services, in-home services and support, protective services and check-
in services for older adults who faced adverse impacts from being socially isolated, were particularly 
critical during this emergency.  

The overwhelming concern about social isolation of seniors during this pandemic has raised the level of 
awareness of the problem and interest, from both the public and private sectors, in helping to address 
it. This experience has also created opportunities to adapt and innovate how we deliver services to and 
support our seniors. Leveraging new partnerships and technology solutions will be key strategies for 
this plan to better support and empower older adults in ways we may not have imagined before this 
pandemic.  

Addressing Racial Discrimination & Inequities 

As Pennsylvania’s older adult population continues to grow and become more diverse, it is important 
for PDA and AAAs to consider the implications that racial discrimination and systemic inequities have 
on individuals as they age. This includes issues, like health disparities, that were magnified during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. PDA and the AAAs are working during this plan to train on issues like unconscious 
bias, diversity and inclusion, cultural competence and trauma in order to more effectively outreach and 
be responsive to the needs of diverse older adults. 

As the state unit on aging, we are bound by the OAA to ensure that preference will be given to provid-
ing services to older adults with greatest economic need and greatest social need. Greatest economic 
need means the need resulting from an income level at or below the poverty line. Greatest social need 
means the need caused by non-economic factors, which include: Physical and mental disabilities; lan-
guage barriers and cultural, social or geographical isolation, including isolation caused by racial or eth-
nic status. We are further called specifically to undertake program development, advocacy and outreach 
efforts focused on the needs of low-income minority individuals.

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders 

Currently there are an estimated 280,000 people aged 65 and older in Pennsylvania who are living with 
Alzheimer’s Disease. By 2025, that number is expected to increase by 14.3% to 320,000. Alzheimer’s 
Disease and related dementias touch nearly every family in some way. For caregivers, the burden can 
be extreme. In Pennsylvania, 677,000 family caregivers provide 771 million hours of unpaid care valued 
at $10.1 billion. At PDA, we not only focus on services for older adults who need help or assistance to 
remain in their homes, we also support these caregivers. The help and support of unpaid friend and 
relative caregivers for loved ones living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is indispensable. 

PDA consistently partners with the two Pennsylvania chapters of the Alzheimer’s Association on pro-
grams, services and outreach for the benefit of people living with Alzheimer’s Disease and all dementias 
and their caregivers throughout the commonwealth. During the state plan period, we will engage the 
Delaware Valley and Greater Pennsylvania Chapters in several collaborative efforts:

•	 Community outreach to increase community and volunteer engagement and develop new com-

munity partnerships, with a focus on underserved and diverse communities

•	 Building public and private partnerships with health systems, public health centers and clini-

cians to change the way we diagnose, treat and support the aging population, especially around 
dementia and cognitive decline

•	 Engaging in evidence-based, person-centered best practices to deliver quality care and support 

in long-term care and community-based settings

•	 Marketing to increase public awareness and messaging about dementia and the importance of 

access to care, early detection, diagnosis, and risk reduction

Dementia Friendly PA

Dementia friendly communities promote communities working together to allow people living with 
dementia to remain in the community to engage with family and others in their day-to-day life. The 
Dementia Friends PA movement has trained over 4,200 people as dementia friends in the two short 
years since the program started. The department has partnered with Dementia Friends PA to train all 
our staff, the ADRD Task Force and AAA directors with plans to spread this movement to every county in 
the commonwealth. 

LGBTQ Age-Friendly PA

In October 2018, PDA held the inaugural LGBTQ Aging Summit with the theme, “Connecting Communi-
ties & Inspiring Change.” The objective of this historic summit, attended by over 300 LGBTQ community 
leaders and advocates, AAA staff, providers, and other stakeholders, was to raise awareness and mo-
bilize collaborative efforts to support LGBTQ older adults. Since the summit, the department and the 
Pennsylvania Commission on LGBTQ Affairs have partnered to continue working on the issues raised at 
the summit and make further progress. The commission has also created an aging workgroup to help 
focus the work to remove obstacles and ensure equality and inclusive programming for LGBTQ older 
adults. The department has a participating member in the workgroup.

One of the key action items from the 2018 LGBTQ Aging Summit was the need for our aging network to 
have the cultural competency to make our entire organization welcoming, friendly and a safe space for 
LGBTQ older adults. PDA partnered with SAGECare, a training arm of the national advocacy organization 
SAGE to provide comprehensive cultural competency training for leadership and staff of PDA, P4A lead-
ership and staff, and AAAs. PDA has received platinum-level SAGECare credentials, and once trainings 
are completed throughout the network, Pennsylvania will be the first state nationally to achieve this 
level of training with its state unit and AAAs. We plan to continue to roll out this training to more of our 
OAA programs during this state plan period.

13  |  2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging

Further action items from the summit include the need to collect sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity (SOGI) data on our consumers. In order to most effectively serve all older adults, we believe data 
collection that supports comprehensive care planning is critical, so the department has action steps to 
implement the collection of SOGI data. Data nationally on this topic is limited; however the American 
Community Survey completed a one-year estimate of same-gender households for select U.S. cities in 
2017. Results of this survey indicated that Philadelphia households included 1% same-gender couples. 
Collection of SOGI data will allow PDA to improve care plans for individuals and contribute to more 
effective program development for LGBTQ older adults.

Integration of Healthcare & Social Services

Pennsylvania currently has four AAAs that have been members of a health information exchange (HIE), 
receiving valuable benefits such as quicker access to medical information on consumers, future ap-
pointments, notification of emergency room visits and hospital admissions, allowing the AAAs to more 
effectively manage their resources and better support their consumers. As a result, PDA has promoted 
and facilitated the participation of all AAAs in health information exchanges to take advantage of and 
leverage the integration of healthcare and social services data. This will provide a holistic picture of an 
individual’s health and social support status enabling healthcare providers, AAAs and other social ser-
vices organizations to better support older adults.

Affordable/Available Housing

In Pennsylvania, nearly one-third of all households have at least one person over 65 living in them. In 
fact, there are more than 630,000 individual householders over 65 in Pennsylvania who live alone. PDA 
recognizes that access to safe, affordable, inclusive and accessible housing is a key factor to being able 
to age in place. 

The PDA State Plan Community and Stakeholder Survey revealed just how important this is to Pennsyl-
vanians when respondents were asked to rate the importance of affordable/available housing to ensur-
ing age-friendly communities for older adults over the next five years:

PDA’s Division of Housing and Community Services is addressing the need for affordable housing by 
collaborating with local, state, and federal agencies to develop and implement innovative housing pilot 
projects to expand housing options for older adults throughout the commonwealth. The pilots have 
created affordable and accessible housing options that can be replicated in communities statewide and 
have proven to be successful options for older adults to remain in their homes and communities. Ongo-
ing initiatives include:

•	 Shared Housing and Resource Exchange (SHARE) is an ongoing shared housing pilot program 

funded by a Money Follows the Person (MFP) grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (CMS). This pilot has been successfully implemented in Pike, Wayne and Monroe coun-
ties, with expansion plans in several other counties throughout the state plan period.

•	 Elder Cottage Housing Opportunity (ECHO) cottages in Clearfield County have successfully 

placed two units housing two older adults, and in July 2020 through a partnership with PDA, 
P4A was awarded a $400K PHARE Grant (Pennsylvania Housing Affordability and Rehabilitation 
Enhancement Fund) which is expanding the ECHO cottage program to several other counties.

Direct Care Worker Shortage 

Pennsylvania’s more than 234,000 direct care workers are critically important to the long-term services 
and supports system (LTSS), helping older adults remain connected to their communities and live their 
best lives possible as they age. Our state faces a growing crisis, however, due to a shortage of these 
crucial paid caregivers. In April 2019, PDA’s LTCC released its Blueprint for Strengthening Pennsylvania’s 
Direct Care Workforce. The report cites low wages, high turnover and lack of a clear career path as just 
a few of the reasons for the shortage. As the older adult population in the commonwealth continues 
to grow, especially in the oldest age category of those over 85, there will be an even higher demand 
for direct care workers. This need was further supported in our State Plan Community & Stakeholder 
Survey, in which over 80% of respondents over 65 years old categorized the need for access to in-home 
care and services as either “absolutely critical” or “very important” to age-friendly communities.

The volatility experienced by this workforce due to low wages, minimum training and high emotional 
and physical demands threatens both access to and the quality of services and supports on which many 
older Pennsylvanians depend. This further jeopardizes continuity of care – a proven factor in improved 
health outcomes. The recommendations contained in the LTCC’s blueprint provide strategies needed to 
empower this workforce and LTSS providers in order to meet the increasing need. PDA is committed to 
pursuing initiatives that remove barriers to entering and remaining in this noble profession.

Hunger and Food Insecurity

According to the America’s Health Rankings 2020 report, food insecurity among older adults is  
expected to increase through 2050 as the baby boomers continue to age. Older adults may report  
missing meals due to a variety of factors including functional limitations affecting their ability to  
prepare them, lack of social support, lack of transportation, and having to choose between food and 
other necessities because they can’t afford both. Food insecurity can have a negative impact on  
overall health for older adults, including increased incidence of heart attack, congestive heart failure, 
high blood pressure, depression, exacerbation of chronic conditions and others. 

15  |  2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging

The America’s Health Rankings 2020 report also found that 14.7% of Pennsylvania adults age 60 and 
older faced the threat of hunger in the preceding 12 months. Although the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) reaches qualifying older adults in poverty in our commonwealth, there are 
opportunities to be creative in how we execute nutrition services provided through the OAA that might 
allow us to better reach and serve individuals at greater risk for food insecurity, including older adults 
who are black/African American, are Latino, live with a disability, live alone, live in poverty, or live in a 
food desert.

Financial Exploitation 

Financial exploitation is a rapidly growing form of elder abuse which has catastrophic impacts on both 
the individual and the economy. As a result of Governor Tom Wolf’s Executive Order on the Protection 
of Vulnerable Populations, PDA was directed to conduct a study, in 2020, of the current impact of finan-
cial exploitation on older Pennsylvanians and the commonwealth. The study found that over 80% of 
victims lived in urban communities, over 60% were female, and nearly two-thirds were either widowed 
or single. The study further found that the average age of a victim was 79 years old.

As a result of the study, the department is implementing several recommendations over the course 
of the state plan. These recommendations include updating the statutory and regulatory language of 
Pennsylvania’s Older Adults Protective Services Act; creating an intra-agency financial exploitation team 
to explore opportunities across state government to address regulatory barriers to reporting financial 
abuse; creating a task force comprised of state agencies and stakeholders; and enhancing communi-
cations to increase prevention education and outreach strategies to those most vulnerable to being 
financially exploited.

Opioid Crisis

PDA is an active member of Pennsylvania’s OPIOID Command Center and works to ensure older adults 
have access to the treatment they need. While older adults are not often directly impacted by opioid 
addiction, the department plays a role in educating them on safe storage, use and proper disposal of 
unused medications.  

PDA’s Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) Program has opioid case management 
built into each enrollee’s file. The program holds and edits opioid claims if they seem inappropriate and 
offers real-time assistance to pharmacies to ensure proper dispensing. 

PACE also utilizes academic detailing through a partnership with Harvard University to provide physi-
cian-to-physician education on the latest and best practices on prescribing opioids to older adults. Ses-
sions include information on treating chronic pain with non-opioid and non-pharmacological therapies, 
when possible.  

Grandfamilies

According to the U.S. Census Bureau 2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Profile, more than 
235,000 grandparents lived with their grandchildren under 18 years old in Pennsylvania, and of that, 
over 84,000 were responsible for the basic needs of their grandchildren. Grandparents and other older 
relative caregivers of children face emotional, financial, and legal challenges as they raise children a sec-
ond time, often unexpectedly. The need to provide effective and comprehensive support to these care-
givers, particularly grandparents raising grandchildren, is vital to ensuring they have access to resources 
that will strengthen their caregiving relationship.    

2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging  |  16

The department has been actively advocating for the needs of grandfamilies through collaborations 
with other state agencies, stakeholder groups, advocacy organizations, the legal community including 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court Advisory Council on Elder Justice, SeniorLAW Center and legislators. 
PDA’s Caregiver Support Program (CSP) provides resources and assistance to caregivers, including 
grandfamilies, with the purpose of alleviating stress and enhancing the caregiving relationship. Grand-
families can benefit from reimbursements for care-related and respite expenses through this program. 
However, there is more work to be done for all of Pennsylvania’s grandfamilies.

The PA Joint State Government Commission Report, Grandfamilies in Pennsylvania: “The Second Time 
Around”, recommends the Caregiver Support Program be expanded to serve grandparents under the 
age of 55. While the PDA CSP will continue to serve individuals 55 and older, we hope to expand the 
program by removing the statutory CSP monthly care plan cost cap and allowing it to be set by the de-
partment; removing the $300 aggregate average requirement for all CSP cases; removing the assistive 
devices limit and $2,000 CSP home modification lifetime limit and allowing it to be set by the depart-
ment.

Social Isolation 

Social circles change as we age, and while there are many definitions of social isolation, it is, in essence, 
a lack of meaningful social connections. For older adults, the type and number of connections shift 
with changing social roles, increasing the risk of isolation. Social isolation can have a negative impact 
on physical health, mental well-being and is associated with a lower use of healthcare and an increased 
risk of mortality. Strong social support and connection, however, have positive effects on health and 
well-being.

The U.S. Census American Community Survey uses six measures as risk factors for social isolation, which 
includes the status of an individual on each of the following: Poverty; living alone; divorced, separated 
or widowed; never married; disability; and independent living difficulty. According to the 2018 5-Year 
American Community Survey, Pennsylvania ranks higher in terms of the number of adults 65 and older 
having these risk factors on four of six factors.

Social isolation has long been a concern of the department. Efforts to study social isolation, develop 
tools to address isolation and mitigate risk are being driven by the Social Isolation Task Force of the 
PCoA. However, the COVID-19 pandemic magnified the focus on social isolation and the issue gained 
the department’s full attention when older adults who attended senior centers daily suddenly needed 
to stay home for their safety.  

As the council’s work continues, so do innovative projects and partnerships at the department aimed at 
addressing this problem. For example, our Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman partnered with 
AARP Pennsylvania to provide phones and tablets to nursing facilities to increase the opportunity to al-
low residents to interact virtually with their loved ones. In addition, the department is developing part-
nerships within the state university system to match older adults at risk of social isolation with students 
who need service learning encounters as part of their degree program.

Technology

Access to technology is something many of us may take for granted. Yet there are nearly 1 million 
Pennsylvanians, including older adults, without broadband internet access. As the COVID-19 pandem-
ic demonstrated, many aging adults could benefit from technology to remain at home and virtually 
connect with loved ones, obtain food and medications, participate in telehealth/telemedicine and even 
socialization. 

The push for high-speed internet everywhere in Pennsylvania has been a part of Governor Wolf’s Re-
store Pennsylvania initiative that addresses the commonwealth’s vital infrastructure needs. In August 
2019, PDA participated in a listening session held by the governor’s office on the initiative, which could 
make a difference for aging adults with telemedicine, home monitoring, fall prevention, and staying 
connected to prevent social isolation. 

The PCoA has voiced its unanimous support of the governor’s Restore PA initiative. Older adults make 
up the fastest-growing age group to use technology, and when they are given the opportunity to learn 
about technology and how to use it, their communication with family and friends increases. In April 
2020, the PCoA released the findings of its statewide survey on how older adults managed during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the results revealed an eagerness to learn about and use technology. Further, 
the State Plan Community and Stakeholder Survey uncovered a strong desire for accessible and avail-
able technology.  

Mental Health

A lack of connection with loved ones and friends can put older Pennsylvanians at risk of social isolation, 
which could lead to depression, loneliness, lack of self-care and more. Many aging and disability com-
munities lack a system of support to treat mental health, while many facilities specializing in mental 
health services do not have appropriate accommodations to properly serve older adults and people 
living with disabilities. 

Suggestions to help combat mental health among older Pennsylvanians include: Provide specialized 
training for mental health providers, reevaluate billing codes that may hinder proper care and treat-
ment, improve accessibility to services, place social workers specialized in geriatrics in senior centers, 
encourage hospitals and medical practices to seek accreditation through the Age-Friendly Health Sys-
tems initiative, and develop destigmatizing public service announcement campaigns involving different 
cultures and age groups. 

According to a 2017 study from the University of Southern California, approximately 1 million adult 
Pennsylvanians struggled with serious psychological distress at least once in 2015. Of those adults, 
more than 27% had an unmet need for mental health care. That population includes 42% who did not 
receive mental health care because they could not afford it.

In early 2020, PDA hosted two roundtable discussions that focused on reducing stigma and under-
standing mental health issues and service needs. The discussions were in coordination with the gover-
nor’s Reach Out PA: Your Mental Health Matters initiative, which is aimed at expanding resources and 
the state’s comprehensive support of mental health and related health care priorities in Pennsylvania.

Trauma-Informed Pennsylvania Plan 

On July 27, 2020, the Wolf Administration released its “Trauma-Informed PA” plan to guide the com-
monwealth and service providers on what it means to be trauma-informed and healing-centered in 
Pennsylvania. The implications of trauma and stress on individuals as they age is a particular concern 
for PDA. Throughout the state plan period, PDA will be promoting and facilitating training within the 
department and to aging network partners to help recognize and be more responsive to older adults 
impacted by trauma.  

The Trauma Informed Plan focuses on six key areas:

1.  Ensuring that state culture is trauma-informed through universal training
2.  Ensuring state agencies’ policies and practices are trauma-informed and more focused on pre-

vention and healing

3.  Mandating that all licensed and funded entities become trauma-informed
4.  Building and supporting grass roots/community-based efforts to become trauma-informed in 

every part of the commonwealth

5.  Recognizing and healing from traumas of major crisis like COVID-19
6.  Preventing and healing racial, communal and historical traumas, whether they be individual or 

systemic

Suicide 

Suicide is a public health concern that affects all communities and in PA, is on the rise in older adults.  
For men, older adult suicide rates are considerably higher than that of younger adults. Suicide is also 
higher in white older adults than in people of color. In the LGBTQ community, lifelong experiences of 
discrimination and homophobia now coupled with ageism can cause feelings of grief that are difficult 
to overcome; and with the information available anecdotally, the number of suicides in LGBTQ older 
adults is also on the rise.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of four older adults who attempts 
suicide dies. While the exact reasons for that figure remain unknown, researchers suggest aging adults 
are frailer and therefore more vulnerable to self-inflicted injury. They can also be more isolated, which 
makes rescues more difficult, and they perhaps even plan their attempts more carefully. Men who are 65 
and older face the highest risk of suicide, while adults 85 and older, regardless of gender, are the sec-
ond most likely age group to die from suicide. 

In late 2019, PDA participated in several listening sessions held across the commonwealth by the Penn-
sylvania Suicide Prevention Task Force. These sessions provided opportunities for attendees to share 
their stories of how suicide and mental health impacted their lives and communities, to offer education-
al information and to share recommendations for the task force to consider in developing a statewide 
suicide prevention plan. 

Access to social connections, trauma informed interventions and mental healthcare continue to be im-
portant to ensuring Pennsylvania is equipped to serve an aging and diversifying commonwealth.

Older Adult Released Prisoner Reentrants 

Over the past decade, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has paroled or released an average 
of 20,000 “reentrants,” annually, some of whom are 60 years of age or older. The recidivism rate for 
these individuals exceeds 70%. Many of those who recidivate are unable to sustain themselves in their 
community because they do not have adequate health care, paid employment, affordable transporta-
tion, or housing.

PDA’s PACE Program “Clearinghouse,” established in 1999, has a legislative authorization to assist per-
sons 19 years of age and older in these circumstances. Working closely with the Department of Cor-
rections, since January 2015 the Clearinghouse has provided critical resources to many reentrants that 
have sustained them in their communities. This program has completed 25,000 phone calls with reen-
trants, assisted 15,000 individuals, and achieved a recidivism rate of under 3%.

State Plan on Aging Development

Strategic Planning and Initial Steps

State plan development began in mid-2019 when senior department leadership gathered for a strategic 
planning meeting to reassess the department’s mission and to create a vision and core values statement 
that aligned with our direction.  During this effort, we added the opening statement to our core values, 
“With older adults at the center of everything we do, we are guided by these core values.”  These watch-
words consistently kept the development of this plan focused on older adults as our most important 
consideration.

Upon release of ACL’s state plan guidance in October 2019, we began to consider how programs and 
initiatives we had in place and those we were considering over the next several years aligned with ACL’s 
four focus areas. This led to a natural emergence of the five overarching goals being pursued through 
2024.

Concurrent to the development of our goals, we also began to share information with our key stake-
holders including the PCoA, who are key partners in ensuring our plan meets the needs of older adults 
in every community throughout the commonwealth. We also began communicating with our network 
of AAAs about our intended development process, as well as the type and scope of guidance they could 
expect from the department for their four-year area plans.

It was very important to our leadership team that this process remain transparent, so wherever possible, 
we shared information with stakeholders. The ACL guidance was shared with the PCoA, AAAs, PA LTCC 
and others, for example. As each step of our internal process was completed, information was shared, 
and feedback welcomed.

In late 2019, the entire PDA team gathered for an all-staff meeting, part of which was dedicated to 
reviewing the 2016-2020 State Plan on Aging and initiating objective and strategy development for 
this plan. It was important to assess ourselves on progress made on that plan, as well as the mechanics 
of it, to determine how this plan could be developed to allow us to clearly demonstrate our results to 
stakeholders, older adults and their caregivers, our network, legislators and the public. We also want to 
ensure that we could adequately hold ourselves accountable to the actions set forth in this plan.

Needs Assessment

In June 2020, the department conducted a needs assessment by using a survey available online or by 
phone. The PA State Plan on Aging 2020-2024 Community and Stakeholder Survey was available on the 
PDA website, through a direct hyperlink, or could be completed by phone, and was available in English 
and Spanish. 

We relied on and appreciated the support of the PCoA, AARP Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Com-
mission on LGBTQ Affairs and the Pennsylvania Commission on Latino Affairs as well as many other 
commissions and stakeholders, to assist in getting the survey press release distributed to encourage 
participation. We also reached out directly to many community organizations to ask for participation 
and shared several different versions of culturally affirming marketing materials with a direct link to the 
survey.

In the survey, we sought to gauge public awareness of aging services and how to access them, includ-
ing protective services. We also asked respondents to rate factors important to age-friendly commu-
nities over the next five years, including what was most important. Finally, we asked respondents to 
consider the next 10 years and beyond and freely share thoughts on what would be needed to maintain 
age-friendly communities in the future.

The survey was open for nearly three weeks and we were pleased to receive 5,599 responses covering 
all 67 counties in the commonwealth. The survey was open to all adults 18 years and older; however 
nearly 4,200 or 75% of respondents were 60 years old and older. The response by race and ethnicity 
closely mirrored that of the current older adult population in the state: American Indian or Alaska Na-
tive .6%, Asian .9%, Black or African American 6.6%, Hispanic or Latino 2.7%, Native Hawaiian or other 
Pacific Islander .05%, Other 1.9%, White 89%.

2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging  |  20

We also heard from several stakeholder groups whose unique needs assisted in informing this plan. 
From caregivers to veterans, people living with disabilities, grandparents raising grandchildren, LGBTQ 
older adults and more; we heard from Pennsylvanians who shared their opinions, concerns and hopes 
for how they will age in our state. Feedback from some of these groups was used throughout the plan 
to further support our actions over this planning period.

Key takeaways from the survey included our need to ensure older adults throughout Pennsylvania are 
better aware of the services available and how to access them, including protective services. 

Respondents told us that over the next five years (2020-2025) and beyond, the following six factors are 
absolutely critical to age-friendly communities:

•	 Affordable prescription medications (67.9%)
•	 Access to in-home care & services (51%)
•	 Available/affordable housing options (45.6%)
•	 Available/affordable transportation (43%)
•	 Dementia-capable/ dementia-friendly communities (40.5%)
•	 Access to mental health services (40.2%)

We also asked survey participants to choose the one factor they believe to be the most critical to 
age-friendly communities, and access to in-home care and services came in at the top, followed closely 
by accessible/affordable housing and affordable prescription medications. Interestingly, the next clos-
est factor considered to be most important after these three was the opportunity to make meaningful 
connections with others.

Finally, the survey asked respondents to share what innovations they felt Pennsylvania needed to meet 
the needs of our growing and diversifying 60+ population in the next 10-20 years. Overwhelmingly, 
Pennsylvanians told us about the need to advance technologies that could help older residents. Broad-
band access in every community in the commonwealth could allow for virtual senior centers, telehealth, 
telemedicine and mental healthcare, remote home monitoring and other services not available in many 
areas, especially rural communities and for those living in poverty. We also heard about the need for 
innovations such as drone and robotic technologies, driverless vehicles and more innovations in hous-
ing for older adults.

The survey validated the department’s work and assisted in ensuring our strategies addressed concerns 
of older adults and their caregivers. Some actions were developed in direct response to what we heard 
on the survey.  In addition, it gave us an opportunity to hear what we need to consider in our strategies 
beyond the current planning period.

Statewide Feedback & Virtual Community Conversation

In July 2020, the department held two Statewide Virtual Community Conversations to formally pres-
ent the State Plan draft and to hear from stakeholders, advocates, older adults and caregivers. Online 
meetings, which could be joined by tablet, computer or telephone, were held in lieu of in-person public 
hearings due to the social-distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic and for the safety of all 
those who might want to attend. Community conversation testimony, as well as participant feedback 
submitted during the conversation, was used to ensure plan goals, objectives, strategies and actions 
met with the needs of older adults and make adjustments where we felt as though we could better 
align with what we were hearing from stakeholders.

The first Community Conversation was held specifically for members of the five regional councils of the 
PCoA as a follow-up to a formal presentation of the plan given to the statewide council a month earlier. 
Prior to the pandemic, our in-person conversations would have been held in the regions represented by 
these dedicated council members, and they were instrumental in the planning of these events before 
the department elected the virtual format ultimately used. Nearly half of the 60 members of the five 
regional councils participated in the conversation. The department welcomed comments and recom-
mendations for the plan shared by the PCoA following their review of the draft.

21  |  2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging

The second Community Conversation was statewide, open to the public, and was well attended with 
over 200 people from across the commonwealth participating virtually either online or by phone. Par-
ticipants were required to register in advance and could request time to present public testimony.  In all, 
eight stakeholders, advocates and community members presented testimony on a variety of topics. All 
the valuable testimony was considered in furthering the development of a responsive state plan. Partic-
ipants in the Community Conversation were also given the opportunity to submit questions about the 
plan, which were answered during the event.

LGBTQ Aging in PA Statewide Virtual Town Hall Meeting

In addition to the two virtual Community Conversations, the department hosted a statewide LGBTQ 
Aging in PA Virtual Town Hall with the Secretary of Aging. This was a follow up to the work done by the 
department on LGBTQ aging issues since it hosted a LGBTQ Aging Summit in 2018. Over 250 people 
from the LGBTQ community, allies, service providers, AAAs, stakeholders, advocates and others joined in 
the dialogue. Twelve stakeholders and advocates from the LGBTQ community, and allies shared testimo-
ny on issues important to LGBTQ older adults, several of which impacted the state plan.

Draft Posted for Public Comment

During July 2020, the draft State Plan on Aging was posted to the department’s website where stake-
holders and the public were able to view specific goals, objectives and strategies of the plan as well as 
the action steps and measures the department would be using to ensure our accountability to the plan. 
Those who desired could also offer feedback on the plan through a link to an open text survey which 
was available throughout the two-week public comment period. We received several feedback sub-
missions, many of them affirming the actions set forth in the draft. Other feedback included wonderful 
suggestions that helped us be more thorough in our explanations and develop a plan that more fully 
meets the needs of older adults in the commonwealth.

Stakeholder Recommendations

In addition to the above discussed methods for gathering state plan input, the department also en-
couraged advocates, stakeholders and even other state agencies to share recommendations to help 
inform the vision and direction of the plan. The aging workgroup of the Commission on LGBTQ Affairs 
conducted its own statewide survey on issues of importance to LGBTQ older adults and based on those 
findings, submitted formal recommendations to the Secretary of Aging. We also received recommenda-
tions from the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA), with whom the department already 
meets regularly to ensure we meet the needs of older and disabled veterans. We found these recom-
mendations and others received to be indispensable when creating a plan that spoke to the needs of 
specific stakeholder groups.

State Plan Quality Assurance

PDA is committed to ensuring continuous quality improvement of all aging programs, as well as con-
tinued progress on the action steps and timelines set forth in this plan. PDA regularly completes quality 
assurance monitoring on programs and services delivered by AAAs. These monitoring efforts are fol-
lowed up by remediations, technical assistance and corrective action plans that assist the AAA in ensur-
ing compliance with policy and regulations. AAAs are similarly required to complete quality assurance 
monitoring on vendors with whom they contract to provide services. Further, PDA is rigorously working 
with AAAs to ensure data integrity by working through data irregularities with exception reporting. 
Benchmark and other reports assist the department in determining if a AAA is in need of programmatic 
guidance. It also assists in crafting more specific program directives and technical assistance documents 
to ensure better accountability, which we also require of ourselves and AAAs in the four-year plan.

One of the department’s core values is that we hold ourselves and partners accountable for results, 
and for a strategic plan that stretches over four years, this value couldn’t be more critical. Every quarter 
throughout the plan period, the department leadership reviews a reporting dashboard of the actions 
laid out in the plan to ensure adherence to targeted benchmarks, monitor progress made and adjust, if 
necessary. If more frequent monitoring is necessary, PDA leadership will consider what adjustments are 
needed to maintain meaningful progress while keeping the end goal a priority.  

2020-2024 Pennsylvania State Plan on Aging  |  22

We ensure transparency of our progress by posting results of specific goals to a simple dashboard when 
milestones are reached, allowing stakeholders and the public to see progress made on the plan. In ad-
dition, the department makes routine periodic updates on plan progress to the PCoA. Throughout the 
state plan period, the department makes data-informed decisions to ensure the actions remain viable 
and on course to meet target outcomes.

Specific to AAAs, the department also has a critical role in monitoring and follow-up of area plans. Each 
AAA has outcomes and performance measures detailed in their Area Plan and is required to report to 
PDA on progress achieved in reaching their goals, objectives and strategies throughout the four-year 
plan period.

PDA Goals, Objectives & Strategies

PDA wants to ensure steady progress toward the five main goals introduced in the executive summary 
of this plan. The PDA management team developed goals, objectives and strategies for the plan, keep-
ing in mind the need to continually improve and innovate, expand our capacity, serve a diverse com-
monwealth and ensure consistent program compliance. 

Elements in support of the objectives and strategies are woven throughout the plan; however, the heart 
of the work to reach the goals comes in the action steps outlined in the plan. While the goals demon-
strate our alignment to the ACL focus areas and our own mission and vision, the actions are a subset of 
each objective and strategy.

The following pages contain details of the goals, objectives and strategies for the 2020-2024 planning 
period. Keeping older adults at the center of everything we do, our efforts focus on furthering all as-
pects of this plan, with adjustments as needed, to improve lives.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
