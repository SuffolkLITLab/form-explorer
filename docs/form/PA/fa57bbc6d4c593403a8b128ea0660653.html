IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA 
 
WESTERN DISTRICT 

No.  23 WM 2020

IN RE: AMENDED  
FIFTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT 
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS 
PLAN  
 
 

AND NOW, this 6th day of May, 2020, consistent with the Order of the 

Supreme  Court  of  Pennsylvania  dated  April  28,  2020,  this  Court  having 

declared a judicial emergency in the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, this 

Court amends its previous Emergency Operations Orders and now orders that 

the actions set forth below be taken pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2).  All 

provisions of this Order apply through June 1, 2020.   

This Court has extended its declaration of a judicial emergency through 

June 1, 2020.  Therefore, the judicial emergency in the Fifth Judicial District, 

which began on March 16, 2020, will continue through June 1, 2020. 

 

I. 

Time Calculations and Deadlines 

•  The  suspensions  of  time  calculations  and  deadlines,  subject  to 

constitutional 

limitations,  as 

indicated 

in  this  Court’s  previous 

Emergency  Operations  Orders,  began  on  March  16,  2020  and  will 

continue through  June  1,  2020,  absent  further  order  of  court.    This 

suspension will have lasted 78 days.  

1 

   

   

 

  Time  calculations  and  deadlines  were  suspended  during  the  judicial 

emergency so that they did not continue to run during that time. Upon 

conclusion of the judicial emergency, new deadlines shall be calculated 

by  adding  the  time  period  of  the  suspension  (days  during  which  time 

calculations  were  suspended  due  to  the  judicial  emergency)  to  the 

original  deadline.  For  example,  if  the  original  deadline  was  March  19, 

2020, and the period of suspension under the judicial emergency was 

78 days, the new deadline would be June 5, 2020 (78 days after March 

19th).  If, however, the deadline expired before the judicial emergency 

began, that deadline would not be extended by the judicial emergency.    

  •

 

 

 

•  Postponements  or  continuances  resulting  from  the  judicial  emergency 

shall be considered court postponements and shall constitute excludable 

time, subject to constitutional limitations for purposes of the application 

of Rule 600.  See Commonwealth v. Bradford, 46 A.3d 693 (Pa. 2012) 

and Commonwealth v. Mills, 162 A. 3d 323 (Pa. 2017).   

•  Attorneys and litigants shall NOT use the judicial emergency to secure 

strategic  advantage  in  litigation,  including  by  dilatory  conduct.  

Individual judges may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a 

failure to meet a deadline was not directly the result of or affected by 

the  judicial  emergency,  (such  as  in  routine  discovery  matters)  and 

whether  the  deadline  should  have  been  met  during  the  judicial 

emergency.  The judge may then take any action deemed appropriate 

to address the situation. 

•  Jury  trials  in  both  the  Criminal  and  Civil  Divisions  remain  suspended 

consistent with the April 28, 2020 Order of the Pennsylvania Supreme 

 

Court. 

2 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  The  local  judicial  emergency  in  the  Fifth  Judicial  District  has  been 

extended through June 1, 2020.  Therefore, no court proceedings in the 

Fifth Judicial District relating to the dispossession of residential property, 

either in the Magisterial District Courts or the Court of Common Pleas, 

will occur before June 2, 2020.  Further, any existing Order or Writ of 

Possession issued with respect to residential property in the Fifth Judicial 

District is stayed until June 2, 2020, and therefore cannot be executed 

or enforced until June 2, 2020.  

II.  Public Access to Court Facilities

Building, is also closed.
