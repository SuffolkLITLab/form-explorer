WHO IS ENTITLED TO AN INTERPRETER? 
Any principal party in interest, witness, victim, parent or person in loco parentis, in any criminal or civil proceeding 
is entitled to an interpreter. Persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) and those who are deaf or hard of hearing 
face special challenges when using the judicial system and court interpreters fulfill a fundamental role in providing 
access to justice and guaranteeing due process rights. An interpreter may also be appointed “for an immediate family 
member of a principal party in interest.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 4412(a)-(d).  

An interpreter shall be appointed by request or “sua sponte, if the presiding judicial officer determines that a principal 
party in interest or witness has a limited ability to speak or understand English.” 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 4412 (a) 

Judges shall presume a need for an interpreter when a self-represented litigant, an attorney, a witness, a deaf or hard 
of hearing person requests one, or when the court or any participants have difficulty speaking or understanding each 
other.  

HOW DO I GET AN INTERPRETER? 
Contact your Language Access Coordinator (LAC), District Court Administrator (DCA) or go to the Interpreter Certifica-
tion Program Roster page. Always submit an appropriately completed Interpreter Request Form to the LAC. 

HOW DO I DETERMINE IF AN INTERPRETER IS NEEDED? 
Ask open-ended questions to ascertain if the person has a limited ability to speak or understand English. Avoid ques-
tions easily answered with yes or no replies.  

Even when a person can answer simple questions, an interpreter should be appointed since legal proceedings use 
terminology that is often unfamiliar to people with limited ability to speak or understand English. Do not assume a 
level of English proficiency based on the person’s length of residence. 

HOW SHOULD I INSTRUCT AN INTERPRETER? 
■ You must interpret everything that is said.
■ Use the first (“I”) person to interpret.
■ Use the third person (“the interpreter”) when referring to yourself.
■ Use the same language level and grammatical construction as the speaker.
■ Do not omit, edit, change, or polish what was said.
■ Interpret the meaning as accurately as possible.
■ Do not have any side conversations with the speaker.
■ Never answer on the speaker’s behalf.
■ You may ask the speaker to pause, repeat what was said, or slow down.
■ You may ask me for clarifications or breaks.

HOW DO I EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF THE INTERPRETER? 
The judge should explain the role of the interpreter to the parties and the jury before the start of any proceeding. 

1. To All Parties, Witnesses, and Others:
“The interpreter is a neutral party who is here only to interpret the proceedings and enable communication. The inter-
preter will interpret everything that is said. Speak slowly and allow the interpreter to finish before continuing. Wait un-
til the entire statement has been interpreted before you answer. Do not ask the interpreter questions. If you have a
question, ask me or your attorney. Do not engage in conversations with the interpreter. The interpreter is not allowed
to give legal advice. When speaking, speak directly to your attorney or to me. If you do not understand the interpreter
tell me. If you disagree with the interpretation, raise your hand. Do you have any questions? Do you understand my in-
structions?”

Individuals who are limited English proficient (LEP), deaf, or hard of hearing should never be expected to use informal 
interpreters, such as family members, opposing parties, or their counsel, nor should the court allow them to be used. 

If a deaf person is involved add “Please be aware that nodding by the deaf person usually means that they are under-
standing the interpreter, not that they agree with what is being said.” 

Please refer to “Voir Dire to Determine Limited Ability to Speak or Understand English” for sample questions. 

WHAT KIND OF INTERPRETER SHOULD I APPOINT? 
Always use certified or otherwise qualified interpreters from the roster either in-person or remotely. Never allow 
family, friends, or others with a potential stake in the outcome to interpret in court. See Table A of the Interpreter 
Guidelines for specific instances of which interpreters should be appointed for which types of cases.  

In-Person Interpretation

1.
In-person certified interpreters must be given preference. A qualified, conditional, or registered interpreter can be
appointed only when a certified interpreter is not available. Interpreters on the roster have been issued ID cards by
the Interpreter Certification Program.

2. To the Jury:
“An interpreter for a language other than English will be used during this proceeding. Although some of you may un-
derstand the foreign language used, it is important for all jurors to consider the same evidence. Therefore, you may on-
ly consider the testimony presented by the official interpreter[s]. You must not rely on your own interpretation of the
witness’ or other parties’ words. The evidence you are to consider is only that provided through the official court inter-
preter.”

WHO CAN I CONTACT IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS? 
 Concerns or questions about the interpreter’s performance: Interpreter Certification Program, 215-560-6300 or

 Concerns or questions about appointment, scheduling, or payment: Judicial District Language Access Coordinator

InterpreterProgram@pacourts.us.

(LAC)

2. Remote Interpretation

Use remote audiovisual technology when you:

last not longer than one hour.

Use telephonic interpreters when: 

 Cannot find a certified or qualified in-person interpreter AND the proceeding is expected to 

 The proceeding is expected to last no longer than 30 minutes
 Remote audiovisual interpretation is unavailable
 Telephonic interpreters are not certified and must be qualified through a voir dire.
