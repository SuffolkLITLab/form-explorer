Appellant 

 No. 1289 EDA 2022 

Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered March 30, 2022 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County Criminal Division

EFORE: 

LAZARUS, J., NICHOLS, J., and McCAFFERY, J. 

MEMORANDUM BY McCAFFERY, J.:   

 

      FILED MARCH 21, 2023 

Khalif  Abdulrua  Sinclair  (Appellant)  appeals  from  the  judgment  of 

sentence entered in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas following 

his jury convictions of first-degree murder, persons not to possess firearms, 

possession  of  an  instrument  of  crime  (PIC),  and  recklessly  endangering 

another person (REAP).1  On appeal, Appellant contends: (1) the jury’s verdict 

was against the weight of the evidence; and (2) the trial court erred in denying 

his request for an involuntary manslaughter jury instruction.  For the reasons 

below, we affirm. 

The underlying charges stem from the November 20, 2020, homicide of 

Abdur Small (the Victim).  Earlier that day, Appellant went to Donte Holland’s

home  at  502  W.  Lafayette  St.,  Norristown,  Montgomery  County,  looking  to 

fight Holland.  N.T., 3/28/22, at 98.  Holland testified that he “heard banging 

[and] someone . . . throwing stuff at [the] door.”  Id.  Appellant and Holland 

got  into  a  heated  verbal  argument  about  Appellant’s  ex-girlfriend,  Jhanely 

Rodriguez (Girlfriend), outside the house.  See id. at 98-99.  Appellant was 

living with Girlfriend next door to Holland, until Appellant was evicted the day 

before as Girlfriend had obtained a temporary Protection From Abuse Order 

against him.  N.T., 3/29/22, at 100-02.  Appellant was arguing with Holland 

about Holland’s prior “one night stand” with Girlfriend.  See N.T., 3/28/22, at 

49; N.T., 3/29/22, at 102.  

Christopher Hall, Holland’s brother and a resident of 502 W. Lafayette 

St., witnessed the interaction between Holland and Appellant.  Hall testified 

that Appellant “felt disrespected” and said, “Watch y’all kids, watch ya’ll crib.”  

N.T., 3/28/22, at 49.  Shawn  McCray,  Holland’s neighbor across the street, 

recalled that Appellant threatened Holland, stating, “[I]f you don’t want to die, 

don’t be here when I get back.”  Id. at 89.   

Appellant then called Nafees Smith (Brother), his brother, asking for a 

gun.  N.T., 3/29/22, at 39.  Brother did not have one, but picked up Appellant 

in Norristown and drove him to a friend’s house in King of Prussia.  Id. at 39-

40.    Brother  then  drove  Appellant  back  to  Norristown.    Id.  at  40.    He  told 

Montgomery County Detective Anthony Caso that he parked by an apartment 

complex  “across  from  the  Norristown  Transportation  Center.”    Id.  at  54.  

- 2 - 

J-A01015-23 

Detective Caso explained there is “a tunnel” in the Transportation Center that 

connects  the  apartment  complex  and  the  Schuylkill  River  Trail.    Id.  at  55.   

Appellant walked through that tunnel to eventually return to 502 W. Lafayette 

St.  Id.  The Commonwealth presented surveillance footage evidence showing 

Appellant  walking  around  the  block  for  15  minutes  before  he  entered  the 

porch.  Trial Ct. Op., 8/17/22, at 8. 

Around 5:00 p.m., Appellant arrived at 502 W. Lafayette St.  The Victim, 

who was not at the  house earlier, and  Holland were downstairs.   See N.T., 

3/28/22, at 104.  They heard someone trying to get into the house, but the 

door was locked.  Id. at 105.  Hall testified that he sold drugs at the house, 

and  it was not unusual  that strangers  would knock at  the door.  Id. at 51.  

Holland stated that the person at the door said, “[G]ang, gang,” which was a 

“friendly  term,”  and  that  his  name  was  “Timmy”  or  “Tommy.”    Id.  at  106, 

108-09.    Holland  went  upstairs  to  get  Hall  and  when  they  looked  out  the 

window, they saw a man in a ski mask wearing all black.  Id. at 106.  It was 

dark outside, and they could not identify the man.  Id. 

As Holland and Hall were walking down the stairs, the front door opened 

and  gun  shots  were  fired.    N.T.,  3/28/22,  at  109-10;  see  also  id.  at  53.  

Holland dove under a table to take cover.  Id. at 100-10.  Hall, who was in 

the living room at this point, fired his own gun at least twice.  N.T., 3/28/22 

at 54-55.  Appellant and the Victim were standing in the doorway area.  Id. 

at 54.  After the shooting, Hall discovered that the Victim had been shot in the 

- 3 - 

head.  Id. at 55.  Everyone immediately called the police.  Id. at 56.  One of 

Hall’s stray bullets — not Appellant’s — hit the Victim.  See id. at 55. 

A few days after the shooting, Appellant asked Girlfriend to take him to 

his sister’s house in Chester.  N.T., 3/29/22, at 104. 

The  Commonwealth  also  presented  the  expert  testimony  of  Detective 

Terrance Lewis of the Montgomery County Forensic Services Unit, summarized 

by the trial court as follow:  

[Detective  Lewis]  recovered  two  9-millimeter  fired  cartridge 
casings, one right next to the doorway . . . and . . .  one . . . a 
couple of feet . . . from the doorway.  A fired projectile was found 
in the basement area.  There were two strike marks, i.e., an area 
that is believed to have been struck by a bullet, in the living room, 
and  a  small  projectile  was  recovered  from  one  of  those  strike 
marks.    More  strike  marks  were  found  above  the  steps,  and  by 
the front window in the living room.  . . .  

etective  Lewis  would  not  know  when  the  strike  marks  were 
made, unless there was something else there to indicate when it 
was struck, such as some debris that was fresh.  
 

Trial  Ct.  Op.  at  12-13  (record  citations  omitted  &  paragraph  break  added).  

  D

Pertinently,  Detective  Lewis  also  testified  “the  strike  mark  above  the  stairs 

was consistent with a .38 revolver.”  Id. at 20. 

Appellant was charged with first-degree murder, persons not to possess 

firearms,  PIC,  and  REAP.    A  three-day  jury  trial  commenced  on  March  28, 

2022.    On  the  second  day  of  trial,  out  of  the  jury’s  presence,  Appellant’s 

counsel requested an involuntary manslaughter jury instruction.  N.T. 3/29/22 

at 6.  The trial court deferred ruling on the matter until all evidence had been 

presented.  Id. at 7. 

- 4 - 

J-A01015-23 

J-A01015-23 

Appellant did not testify at trial but presented character witnesses; his 

mother, sister, and friends testified he has a reputation for being a peaceful 

and law-abiding citizen.  See N.T., 3/29/22, at 150, 155, 158, 161. 

At the close of the evidence, Appellant again requested an involuntary 

manslaughter jury instruction.  N.T., 3/29/22, at 177.  In support, Appellant 

argued  the  evidence  showed  his  “bullet  was  shot  over  the  head  of  Donte 

Holland, causing return fire[,]” and “[Appellant] did not intend to kill him but 

it was reckless.”  Id. (emphasis added). 

On the last day of trial, the trial court denied Appellant’s jury instruction 

request,  finding  the  evidence  did  not  support  intent  consistent  with 

involuntary manslaughter.  N.T., 3/30/22, at 3-4.  The court considered the 

evidence that Appellant had “already expressed his intentions of killing” and 

intentionally returned to the house armed with a gun, and found the shooting 

did not “just happen[ ] as a result of total recklessness.”  Id. at 4. 

The trial court then gave its final instructions to the jury.  Immediately 

thereafter,  the  court  asked  the  parties  whether  they  had  any  additions  or 

corrections.  N.T., 3/30/22, at 85.  Pertinently, Appellant replied, “No.”  Id. 

The  jury  found  Appellant  guilty  of  first-degree  murder  by  transferred 

intent,2 persons not to possess firearms, PIC, and REAP.  Appellant waived his

right to a presentence investigation.  On the same day, the trial court imposed 

concurrent sentences of life imprisonment for  murder, one to  two years for 

persons  not  to  possess  firearms,  one  to  two  years  for  PIC,  and  one  to  two 

years for REAP.    

Appellant  filed  a  timely  post-sentence  motion  on  April  7,  2022, 

challenging:  (1)  the  weight  of  the  evidence;  and  (2)  the  denial  of  the 

involuntary manslaughter jury instruction request.  On the same day, the trial 

court denied the post-sentence motion.    

Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on May 6, 2022, and complied 

with the trial court’s order to file a concise statement of errors complained of 

on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925.   

Appellant raises the following issues on appeal:   

1.    Is  [Appellant]  entitled  to  an  arrest  of  judgment  and/or  new 
trial in the above-captioned matter on the ground that the jury’s 
verdict was against the weight of the evidence since the evidence 
did not support a finding of specific intent to kill because it showed 
that [Appellant] merely fired over [the] top of Donte Holland into 
the ceiling over the staircase of 502 W. Lafayette St[.]?   

.  Did the lower court err in denying [Appellant’s] request for an 
involuntary manslaughter jury instruction since evidence existed 
supporting  such  a  charge,  namely,  analysis  of  the  crime  scene 
that revealed evidence from which the jury could potentially infer 
that [Appellant] did not intend to kill Donte Holland, but rather, 
merely  fired  over  [the]  top  of  Holland  into  the  ceiling  over  the 
staircase of 502 W. Lafayette St.?

Commonwealth v. Jones, 912 A.2d 268, 279 (Pa. 2006), citing 18 Pa.C.S. 
§ 303(b)(1).

J-A01015-23 

First, Appellant asserts that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of 

the evidence because there was no evidence he had a specific intent to kill.  

Appellant’s Brief at 11.  We note the relevant standard of review for challenges 

to the weight of the evidence:   

The weight of the evidence is exclusively for the finder of fact, who 
is  free  to  believe  all,  none  or  some  of  the  evidence  and  to 
determine the credibility of the witnesses.  Resolving contradictory 
testimony and questions of credibility are matters for the finder of 
fact.  It is well-settled that we cannot substitute our judgment for 
that of the trier of fact. 

oreover, [a]ppellate review of a weight claim is a review of the 
exercise of discretion, not the underlying question of whether the 
verdict  is  against  the  weight  of  the  evidence.    Because  the  trial 
judge  has  had  the  opportunity  to  hear  and  see  the  evidence 
presented, an appellate court will give the gravest consideration 
to  the  findings  and  reasons  advanced  by  the  trial  judge  when 
reviewing  a  trial  court’s  determination  that  the  verdict  is  [or  is 
not]  against  the  weight  of  the  evidence.    One  of  the  least 
assailable reasons for granting or denying a new trial is the lower 
court’s  conviction  that  the  verdict  was  or  was  not  against  the 
weight of the evidence and that a new trial should be granted in 
the interest of justice. 
  
Furthermore, in order for a defendant to prevail on a challenge to 
the  weight  of  the  evidence,  the  evidence  must  be  so  tenuous, 
vague and uncertain that the verdict shocks the conscience of the 
court.

Commonwealth  v.  Miller,  172  A.3d  632,  642-43  (Pa.  Super.  2017) 

(citations and quotation marks omitted).   

 

Further, this Court will not find an abuse of discretion  

based on a mere error of judgment, but rather . . . when the [trial] 
court has reached a conclusion which overrides or misapplies the 
law, or where the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, 

- 7 - 

J-A01015-23 

Appellant’s Brief at 3. 

J-A01015-23 

or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will.  Importantly, 
[this C]ourt should not find that a trial court abused its discretion 
merely because [we] disagree[ ] with the trial court’s conclusion.  
Indeed, when reviewing the trial court’s exercise of discretion, it 
is improper for [this C]ourt to step[ ] into the shoes of the trial 
judge  and  review  the  evidence  de  novo.    In  other  words,  [this 
C]ourt  may  not  disturb  a  trial  court’s  discretionary  ruling  by 
substituting its own judgment for that of the trial court. 
 

Commonwealth  v.  Gill,  206  A.3d  459,  467  (Pa.  2019)  (citations  and 

quotation marks omitted).   

Appellant does not challenge his liability under the theory of transferred 

intent.  Instead, he contends the evidence merely showed he “negligently or 

recklessly fir[ed] a shot over the head [of] Donte Holland.”  Appellant’s Brief 

at 12.  In support, Appellant reasons: 

The only evidence of a firearm being fired into the property – the 
position  from  which  [Appellant]  would  have  been  firing  –  was  a 
strike mark that entered the ceiling of the first floor at the top of 
the  stairs  leading  to  the  second  floor.    Such  a  shot,  however, 
would have been well over the heads of Donte Holland and the . . . 
other occupants and thus, was inconsistent with the intent to kill.  
. . .  
 

Id.  Appellant avers that the jury’s finding of a specific intent to kill “shocks 

the [conscience].”  Id.  We conclude no relief is due. 

 

We note: 

In order to find a defendant to be guilty of first-degree murder, a 
jury  must  find:  (1)  a  specific  intent  to  kill;  and  (2)  malice.  
Pursuant to the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to murder 
may  be  transferred  where  the  person  actually  killed  is  not  the 
intended victim. . . . 
 

Jones, 912 A.2d at 279, citing 18 Pa.C.S. § 303(b). 

- 8 - 

J-A01015-23 

[“S]pecific  intent  to  kill  can  be  inferred  from  the  circumstances 
surrounding  an  unlawful  killing.    Because  a  person  generally 
intends the consequences of his act, specific intent to kill may be 
inferred from the fact that the accused used a deadly weapon to 
inflict injury to a vital part of the victim’s body.” 
 

Commonwealth v. Geathers, 847 A.2d 730, 737 (Pa. Super. 2004). 

 

In denying relief, the trial court reasoned: 

[Appellant] wanted the jury to believe that the strike mark above 
the  steps  was  a  strike  mark  from  the day  of  the  murder,  which 
was a fact the jury had to determine[,] and that it was made by 
[Appellant’s]  firearm,  which  [he]  claimed  was  a  revolver,  which 
was another fact the jury had to determine.  . . .  
 

Trial  Ct.  Op.  at  20.    However,  “the  jury  did  not  credit  [this]  theory  of  the 

evidence,” but instead “credit the evidence of [Appellant’s] specific intent to 

kill Holland.”  Id.  The trial court cited the following evidence: 

[Appellant]  threatened  to  return  to  Holland’s  house  after  the 
verbal argument in order to kill him; [Appellant] did in fact return 
with a firearm; [and] he lied in wait for Holland[,] surreptitiously 
tried to gain entry into the home by pretending he was someone 
friendly to the home’s residents[,] and when the door opened and 
Holland was in his sight he shot off his firearm.  This evidence was 
demonstrated  and  corroborated  through  several  witnesses  and 
video surveillance.  . . . 
 

Id. at 20-21.  Thus, the trial court determined that the verdict was supported 

by the weight of the evidence.  Id. at 21. 

 

Appellant  does  not  address  or  dispute  the  trial  court’s  reasoning.    He 

merely focuses on the evidence of the strike mark at the top of the staircase.  

Appellant’s  Brief  at  12.    Appellant  ignores  the  trial  court’s  discussion  of  the 

evidence that he: threatened Holland during an argument earlier in the day; 

asked his brother for a gun and when Brother did not have one, they drove to 

- 9 - 

J-A01015-23 

a friend’s house to retrieve one; rode back with the gun and had Brother park 

away  from  the  house;  walked  around  the  house  for  15  minutes  before 

approaching the front door; disguised himself with a ski mask; pretended to 

be someone else when he tried to gain entry to the house; and finally, shot in 

Holland’s direction once the door was opened.  Appellant also ignores the trial 

court’s  discussion  that  the  expert  witness  testified  he  could  not  determine 

when the strike mark was made.  

We emphasize the jury was free to consider all the evidence presented 

at trial.  See Miller, 172 A.3d at 642-43.  Indeed, a jury “who hears witness 

testimony first-hand is able to take into account not only the words that are 

spoken  and  transcribed,  but  the  witnesses’  demeanor,  tone  of  voice, 

mannerisms, and the like.”  Commonwealth v. Johnson, 231 A.3d 807, 818 

(Pa. 2020).  Here, the jury considered all the testimony and video surveillance 

footage presented.  We decline to substitute our credibility determinations for 

that  of  the  jury.    See  Gill,  206  A.3d  at  467;  Miller,  172  A.3d  at  642-43.  

Therefore,  we  affirm  the  trial  court’s  determination  that  the  weight  of  the 

evidence supports the jury’s verdict. 

Second, Appellant challenges the trial court’s denial of his  request for 

an  involuntary  manslaughter  jury  instruction.    Appellant’s  Brief  at  13.  

Appellant contends that the court “employed an incorrect standard of review” 

because it did not view the evidence in the light most favorable to him.  Id. 

at 15.  He argues:  

- 10 - 

In its 1925(a) opinion, the trial court . . . states, “[t]here was no 
direct  evidence  suggesting  [the  strike  mark  at  the  top  of  the 
stairs] was from his firearm or whether that strike mark was even 
made on the night of the murder.  It was a defense theory, not 
evidence.” 

his  holding  is  incorrect  [because]  it  ignores  that  in  addressing 
the propriety of a jury instruction requested by the defense, the 
court must[ ] view the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
defendant.  . . . 
 

  T

Id. at 15-16 (citations and some quotation marks omitted).  Appellant insists 

the jury could have inferred, from the evidence of the strike mark at the top 

of the staircase, that he did not intend to kill Holland.  Id. at 16.  We determine 

this issue is waived. 

of review is well-settled:   

When reviewing a challenge to jury instructions, this Court’s standard 

the  reviewing  court  must  consider  the  charge  as  a  whole  to 
determine if the charge was inadequate, erroneous, or prejudicial.  
The  trial  court  has  broad  discretion  in  phrasing  its  instructions, 
and  may  choose  its  own  wording  so  long  as  the  law  is  clearly, 
adequately,  and  accurately  presented  to  the  jury  for  its 
consideration.  A new trial is required on account of an erroneous 
jury  instruction  only  if  the  instruction  under  review  contained 
fundamental error, misled, or confused the jury.  
  

Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 986 A.2d 759, 792 (Pa. 2009).  However, in 

order  to  preserve  an  objection  to  jury  instructions,  a  party  must  make  a 

specific objection after the trial court reads the instructions, before jury retires 

to  deliberate.    Commonwealth  v.  Cosby,  224  A.3d  372,  421  (Pa.  Super. 

2019), vacated on other grounds, 252 A.3d 1092 (Pa. 2021).

Here,  although  Appellant  requested  a  jury  instruction  on  involuntary 

manslaughter, he did not object to the jury instructions after they were given 

to the jury.  See N.T., 3/30/22, at 85.  The court asked both parties if there 

were “any additions or corrections to [the] instructions,” and both parties said, 

“[N]o.”  Id.  As a result, the jury instruction issue is waived for our review.  

See Cosby, 224 A.3d at 421.  

Moreover,  even  if  Appellant  had  properly  objected  to  the  jury 

instruction, we would agree that no relief is due.  Involuntary manslaughter is  

a  killing  that  occurs  when,  as  a  direct  result  of  the  doing  of  an 
unlawful  act  in  a  reckless  or  grossly  negligent  manner,  or  the 
doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, an 
individual causes the death of another person.  An instruction on 
involuntary manslaughter is not required unless it has been made 
an issue in the case and the facts would support such a verdict. 
 

Fletcher,  986  A.2d  at  790  (quotation  marks  omitted),  citing,  inter  alia,  18 

Pa.C.S. § 2504(a).   

In this case, the trial court explained that “the facts developed at trial 

did not reasonably support a finding of involuntary manslaughter.”  Trial Ct. 

Op. at 24.  We agree.  As discussed earlier, Appellant threated Holland during 

an  argument,  returned  a  few  hours  later  with  a  gun,  wearing  a  ski  mask; 

attempted to gain entry to the house, and shot in Holland’s direction once the 

door  opened.    The  trial  court  found  the  evidence  was  inconsistent  with 

involuntary  manslaughter  or  recklessness.    Again,  Appellant  cites  only  the 

evidence that supports his argument and disregards all the surrounding facts 

that the trial court discussed in its opinion.

J-A01015-23 

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of sentence.  

Judgment of sentence affirmed.
