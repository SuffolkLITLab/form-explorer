JUDICIAL
BUDGET
REQUEST

Established more than three centuries ago, the Pennsylvania courts 
have a history of providing efficient, effective and fair access to justice 
for all who come before them. Since their inception however, the 
breadth and depth of services and support provided by the courts 
has evolved and expanded. Problem-solving courts, ensuring court 
access in a myriad of ways, and customizing programs to meet the 
needs of our youngest and oldest citizens are part of this evolution.

Ample funding, along with sound and efficient fiscal management, 
allow us to continue fulfilling the courts’ traditional and expanded 
missions.

AOPConnected takes a look at the Unified 
Judicial System’s 2018-2019 budget request 
to the legislative and executive branches.

JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 
EVALUATING JUDICIAL 
RESOURCES

As trial court work evolves and becomes more complex, 

evaluating current court operations, workload and 

resources is necessary to ensure that appropriate 

resources are available to manage and resolve court 

business. 

Contracting with the National Center for State Courts, 

the Judicial Needs Assessment (JNA) was completed in 

2017. Results show that overall, Pennsylvania’s Courts of 

Common Pleas are sized correctly, with the appropriate 

number of jurists in each county to do the job.

Additionally though, the report provides critical data to 

evaluate current and future resource needs, to ensure 

fair, timely and accessible justice for all.

ANNUAL 
COLLECTIONS

The efficient and effective collection   

of fines, fees, costs and restitution   

remains a top priority.

Historically, Pennsylvania courts have 

collected more in fines, fees, costs and 

restitution than is appropriated to the 

judiciary. 2017 is no different, with more 

than $471 million collected and pushing the 

amount collected during the past 10 years 

to $4.6 billion. These dollars, for the most 

part, flow to state, local governments and 

victims of crime, with a small portion of 

the money distributed to airports, parking 

authorities and libraries.

year marking an increase of 13% over the 

prior year. 

BREAKING NEW GROUND 
IN JUDICIAL EDUCATION

The Unified Judicial System, under the direction of the 

Supreme Court, remains focused on the importance of 

judicial education. During the past year, the Court mandated 

that all trial and appellate court jurists must earn 12 hours 

of continuing judicial education each year. AOPC/Judicial 

Education administers this new program under the guidance 

of the Continuing Judicial Education Board of Judges. 

Magisterial District Judges continue to participate in a 

separate continuing education program. 

The judiciary also recently released bench cards and 

instructional videos intended to enhance judicial education 

efforts for more than 450 trial jurists hearing cases 

involving sexual assault and violence statewide. This project 

makes Pennsylvania the first state in the nation to use 

dedicated sexual assault and violence educational resources.

Disciplinary Board 
announces diversity 
data collection 

Fostering justice through the elimination of disparities in the judicial system 
has been a priority of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. 

There is significant value to increasing diversity in the legal profession: 

• 
• 

increased public trust and confidence in the justice system;
increased access to the profession for historically disadvantaged 
individuals.

Without reliable data on the state of diversity within the profession, it is 
difficult, if not impossible, to move forward with programs to increase 
diversity and inclusion.

Therefore, the Court has directed the Disciplinary Board to collect data on 
the gender, racial and ethnic composition of Pennsylvania attorneys, by 
including a voluntary question requesting self-identification on the annual 
attorney registration. Attorneys will see these changes during the 2018-
2019 registration year.

The collected data will establish a demographic baseline of Pennsylvania 
attorneys, track changes in the demographics of the profession for 
purposes of measuring progress, and provide useful information to the 
courts. 

The Disciplinary Board’s collection of attorney diversity data extends the 
Court’s commitment to justice by gathering foundational information to help 
identify and eliminate barriers to fairness within the court system and the 
legal profession.

AOPC employees volunteer for youth basketball

 

AOPC Judicial Programs 
Administrator, Andy Simpson, and 
his wife, Destiny, serve as league 
directors of Camp Hill United 
Methodist Church (UMC) Upward 
Basketball program. Last season, 
the program served over 390 
children from kindergarten to 6th 
grade participating in basketball and 
cheer in the Capitol Region. 

“The ultimate success of the 
program is the result of every 
passionate and selfless volunteer, 
including over 70 coaches, 20 
referees and countless others,” 
Simpson recalled. 

One of the more passionate 
volunteers, AOPC’s Senior Legal 
Counsel, David Price, served 
as a coach for his son’s squad 
this past season. Richard Long, 
Esq., Executive Director of the 
Pennsylvania District Attorney’s 
Association, also tirelessly coached 
two of his children’s teams. 

“The driving force behind our 
dedication is being able to give 
back,” Simpson commented. “I 
learned from my high school 
basketball coach that life’s reward is 
through service to others.”

In the two years since taking over 
as directors, the program has 
continued its success by adding 
another 80-100 combined players 
and cheerleaders, reaching maximum 
capacity at the gym. On any given 
weekend in the winter, over 1,500 
family and friends pack the Camp Hill 
UMC gym for an exhilarating game day 
experience.

“Using the gifts and passion of the 
volunteers, we try to make each game 
a moment to remember – to deliver a 
performance that keeps folks coming 
back,” he said. “We also have a zero

“We are thankful to work with an 
amazing leadership team along with 
the numerous dedicated volunteers,” 
Simpson says. 

As far as the future of the program, he 
says they will trust and follow in faith. 

tolerance for negativity directed at 
players, coaches or refs. Cheering is 
encouraged, yelling is prohibited.” 

During games, players receive equal 
playing time, the opportunity to start 
multiple games, and are matched-up 
to similarly skilled players on the other 
team to avoid mismatches. During 
halftime, the kids learn about virtues 
such as courage, patience, kindness 
and love.

GUARDIANSHIP
TRACKING SYSTEM

Designed with 
guardians in mind
Beginning in December 2018, all 
court-appointed guardians of adult 
incapacitated persons will have 
the convenience of filing inventory 
and annual reports online through 
Pennsylvania’s Guardianship Tracking 
System (GTS). This new system 
simplifies guardian filings, understands 
key guardian responsibilities and 
keeps guardians informed. 

Developed by AOPC/IT and the Office 
of Elder Justice in the Courts, GTS 
incorporates statewide input from 
guardians, judges, court staff, Orphans’ 
Court clerks and others. Several county 
stakeholder meetings identified local 
guardianship practices and highlighted 
how GTS will complement and possibly 
enhance them.

“We based the system on Supreme 
Court-approved guardianship 
reporting forms that must be used 
in Orphans’ Court offices statewide,” 

said Amy Ceraso, AOPC/IT director. 
“Guardians who file reports in multiple 
counties should find the system 
particularly helpful as it eliminates any 
inconsistencies with paper forms and 
simplifies how forms are completed 
and filed.”

The GTS provides an online alternative 
to the paper-based forms currently 
used to submit inventory and annual 
person and estate reports. Additionally, 
the GTS will calculate financial totals 
automatically and provide onscreen 
assistance – all while providing a 
secure way to submit information 
online.

To use the new system, a guardian 
will log in with a secure user account, 
and a unique access code issued to 
the guardian by the court. Once filed, 
annual reports and inventories are only 
viewable by the responsible Orphans’ 
Court office.

Additionally, filing fees can be paid 
online with a credit or debit card. 
AOPC has already processed hundreds 

8

of millions of dollars in court-related 
payments and all transactions will 
be protected using this established 
payment method.

As an added feature, GTS will send an 
e-mail reminder when the due date 
for an annual report is approaching. It 
will also send confirmation messages 
when the court has received an online 
submission.

The GTS project is currently in phase 
two of development and should be 
completed and fully tested in May – 
followed by user acceptance testing in 
June. Allegheny and Dauphin counties 
will begin piloting the system in July 
and August, and all remaining counties 
should begin using GTS by December 
2018.

Civil system 
research
With the Guardianship Tracking System 
on track to go live by December, 
research has begun regarding possible 
options for civil case management.

Since the late 80’s, the Supreme 
Court’s plan for statewide automation 
has been steadily progressing – 
starting with the implementation of 
the Magisterial District Judge system 
(MDJS) and followed by the Appellate 
Courts system (PACMS) and Common 
Pleas Criminal system (CPCMS). 

Over the past few months, AOPC/
IT and Deloitte Consulting have 
worked to gather information by 
reaching out to president judges, court 
administrators and prothonotaries via 
focus groups and a statewide survey. 
Most recently, several vendors known 
to have case management systems 
received a request for information 
from AOPC to better understand their 
system capabilities, operational areas, 
support and cost.

AOPC/IT and Deloitte continue to 
research options and will provide 
recommendations for the Supreme 
Court’s consideration.

Collection agency 
contract
A growing number of states are 
looking to private collection agencies 
to settle long-overdue court debt – and 
Pennsylvania is joining this movement. 

“Counties have requested 

this service because it’s 

important to make people 

accountable and follow 

through on court orders, 

as well as for restitution 

for crime victims.”

In February, AOPC released an 
invitation to bid seeking proposals for 
statewide collection agency services 
at competitive rates for use by any 
judicial district. 

“With declining revenues, counties 
have limited resources and dedicating 
staff to collect court fines and fees 
is becoming increasingly difficult,” 
said Amy Ceraso, AOPC/IT director. 

“Counties have requested this service 
because it’s important to hold people 
accountable, follow through on court 
orders, and ensure restitution for crime 
victims is received.” 

The selected vendor will develop 
an electronic interface to process 
cases from the courts of common 
pleas, Philadelphia Municipal Court 
and magisterial district courts. The 
collection agency will add its fee to the 
court-ordered obligations and remit 
collections to the individual courts on 
a weekly basis. The contract should 
be awarded this spring, followed by 
an implementation schedule for all 
interested counties.

New problem-solving courts 
administrator

The AOPC welcomed Angela Sobol Lowry as its new 
Problem-Solving Court Administrator in February. Angela 
succeeds Karen Blackburn who retired in December. 

Lowry is an experienced human services professional whose 
expertise in program implementation, team building, statistical 
analysis and grant management made her the ideal candidate 
to lead the problem-solving court program. She also brings 
extensive experience and expertise in the juvenile court and 
criminal justice systems to the AOPC. 

Originally from Pennsylvania, Lowry began her career as a 
juvenile probation officer in Northumberland County, where 
she worked directly with children and their families involved 
with the criminal justice system. 

After relocating to Maryland, she served as coordinator for 
the drug court for the City of Baltimore, responsible for the 
planning, management and daily operations of the drug court 
program.

In addition to her role with the City of Baltimore Drug Court, 
she served in various roles including as project coordinator 
for the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council in Baltimore. In 
that position, Lowry coordinated the implementation of the 
Fugitive Safe Surrender program, operated in conjunction with 
the U.S. Marshals Service to address the backlog of warrants in 
Baltimore City. 

She holds a bachelor’s degree from Susquehanna 
University and her master’s in Administration of Justice from 
Shippensburg University.

Pro bono service in Pennsylvania

Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor recently wrote to more 
than 70,000 registered lawyers in Pennsylvania thanking 
them for their continued commitment to pro bono service in 
the commonwealth. Annually, the Chief’s pro bono appeal 
asks lawyers to support civil legal aid programs through 

direct representation and financial contributions, which are 
a component of annual attorney registration fees. These 
programs and services are a critical part of the Court’s effort 
to provide civil legal aid for those who cannot afford services.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
