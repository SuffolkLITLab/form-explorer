EFORE:  PANELLA, P.J., LAZARUS, J., and SULLIVAN, J. 

OPINION BY PANELLA, P.J.: 

FILED MARCH 23, 2023 

The  justice  system  in  America  is  a  distinctive  system  which  requires 

cooperation  among  diverse  professionals  and  entities  who  have,  at  times, 

conflicting goals but a united responsibility – a fair and just trial.   This case 

demonstrates how unethical conduct by an attorney disrupts the integrity of 

the  criminal  justice  system  and  causes  the  corruption  of  the  criminal  trial

process.  The Appellant’s original choice for defense counsel, Lauren Wimmer, 

Esq.,  engaged  in  conduct  that  offended  the  trial  court’s  expectations  of  the 

ethical  and  vigorous  advocacy  required  from  a  member  of  the  Bar  of 

Pennsylvania.  Her actions put the wheels in motion for the unfortunate, and 

regrettable outcome that a new trial is required.  This is necessary although 

we must sympathize with the frustration of the trial court in having to address 

this  issue  and  the  anger  of  the  prosecution  after  it  learned  of  her  actions.  

However,  as  always,  it  is  the  application  of  the  law  which  determines  the 

appropriate appellate decision and not the personal outrage which results from 

the conduct of counsel.  

In this case, Nathaniel Roy Lewis appeals from the judgment of sentence 

entered after a jury convicted him of two counts of attempted homicide and 

related crimes arising from an incident where Lewis fired more than 30 rounds 

from a high-powered semi-automatic rifle at members of the Chester County 

Emergency Response Team (“CCERT”). Prior to trial, the trial court disqualified 

Lewis’s  chosen  counsel  based  on  allegations  she  had  leaked  portions  of 

footage from CCERT team leader Detective Paul Trautmann’s body camera to 

national media and further, had made public statements impugning Detective 

Trautmann’s  credibility  on  a  television  broadcast.  Lewis  contends  the  trial 

court  violated  his  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  counsel  by  disqualifying  his 

counsel.  We  agree,  and  therefore  vacate  his  judgment  of  sentence  and 

remand for a new trial.

J-A28035-22 

 

 For  purposes  of  this  appeal,  Lewis  does  not  dispute  the  following 

summary of the evidence at trial. See Appellant’s Brief, at 2-7. In the evening 

of December 25, 2018, Lewis barricaded himself in his residence. CCERT was 

summoned to the scene and communicated with Lewis in an effort to get him 

to  surrender.  Shortly  after  midnight,  Lewis  began  shooting  out  of  his 

residence.  Over  the  next  six  hours,  Lewis  fired  at  least  30  shots,  including 

several that struck an armored vehicle operated by CCERT. Just after 7 a.m., 

Lewis left his residence and surrendered to CCERT members. 

 

The  Commonwealth  subsequently  charged  Lewis  with  12  counts  of 

attempted homicide, 24 counts of aggravated assault, 21 counts of recklessly 

endangering another person, two counts of possessing an instrument of crime, 

and  one  count  of  institutional  vandalism.  Lewis  was  appointed  a  public 

defender,  but  quickly  became  dissatisfied  with  counsel.  On  April  25,  2019, 

Lewis privately retained Attorney Wimmer to represent him in this matter. 

 

For over a year, this case proceeded through discovery and other pre-

trial  matters.  Then,  as  the  case  neared  trial  in  early  July  2020,  CBS  News 

broadcast  two  segments  based  on  this  case.  First,  CBS  News  aired  footage 

from  a  body  camera  worn  by  a  CCERT  officer  which  revealed  members  of 

CCERT  suggesting,  outside  of  Lewis’s  presence,  that  Lewis  commit  suicide. 

This recording had been produced to Attorney Wimmer during discovery, but 

CBS News credited Lewis’s family for the recording. Second, CBS News aired 

- 3 - 

J-A28035-22 

an interview with Attorney Wimmer that commented on  the professionalism 

of the prosecuting police officer, Detective Trautmann. 

 

On July 14, 2020, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine, seeking, 

among  other  requests  discussed  more  fully  below,  to  disqualify  Attorney 

Wimmer  from  the  case.  The  court  held  a  hearing  the  next  day,  and  after 

hearing  testimony 

from  Assistant  District  Attorney  Myles  Matteson, 

disqualified Attorney Wimmer. Lewis retained new counsel, and  over a year 

later, in September 2021, a jury convicted Lewis of two counts of attempted 

homicide,  13  counts  of  aggravated  assault,  seven  counts  of  recklessly 

endangering another person, two counts of possessing an instrument of crime, 

two counts of criminal mischief, one count of terroristic threats, and one count 

of institutional vandalism. In early 2022, the trial court imposed a sentence of 

27½  to 57 years in prison. This timely appeal followed. 

 

In his single issue on appeal, Lewis challenges the disqualification of his 

chosen counsel, Attorney Wimmer. We apply a plenary standard of review to 

Lewis’s claim. See Darrow v. PPL Electric Utilities Corp., 266 A.3d 1105, 

1111  (Pa.  Super.  2021).  While  the  Commonwealth  contends  the  proper 

standard of review is for abuse of discretion, we note that the authorities relied 

upon by the Commonwealth deal with alleged conflicts of interest between a 

district  attorney’s  office  and  an  alleged  victim.  See  Commonwealth  v. 

Lutes, 793 A.2d 949, 955 (Pa. Super. 2002); Commonwealth v. Stafford, 

749  A.2d  489,  494  (Pa.  Super.  2000).  A  prosecutor  is  not  counsel  for  an 

- 4 - 

J-A28035-22 

alleged victim. See Commonwealth v. Price, 684 A.2d 640, 642 (Pa. Super. 

1996). Therefore, Lutes and Stafford are distinguishable. 

We begin our analysis by reiterating that while this appeal necessarily 

focuses  on  Attorney  Wimmer’s  actions,  it  is  Lewis’s  constitutional  right  to 

counsel  that  is  at  stake.  It  is  axiomatic  that  a  criminal  defendant  has  an 

absolute right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of 

the  United  States  and  Article  I,  Section  9  of  the  Pennsylvania  Constitution. 

Commonwealth v. Moore, 633 A.2d 119 (Pa. 1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 

1114  (1995).  Furthermore,  Lewis  has  a  constitutional  right  to  “a  fair 

opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” United States v. Gonzalez-

Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 144 (2006). Specifically, the Sixth Amendment to the 

United  States  Constitution  “commands,  not  that  a  trial  be  fair,  but  that  a 

particular  guarantee  of  fairness  be  provided  –  to  wit,  that  the  accused  be 

defended by the counsel he believes to be best.” See id., at 146. If Lewis’s 

right to proceed with counsel of his choosing were violated, he is entitled to a 

new trial as prejudice is presumed. See id., at 144. 

 

That  right  is  not  unconstrained,  however.  See  id.  Reasonable  limits 

based  on  the  interests  of  justice  can  override  Lewis’s  desires.  The  most 

obvious  example  of  such  a  limit  is  the  requirement  that,  other  than  by 

proceeding pro se, Lewis cannot choose an attorney that is not licensed and 

in good standing, or otherwise admitted to practice law in the Commonwealth 

of  Pennsylvania.  See,  e.g.,  Powell  v.  Unemployment  Compensation 

- 5 - 

J-A28035-22 

Board  of  Review,  157  A.3d  884,  890-91  (Pa.  2017).  Here,  there  is  no 

indication in the record that Attorney Wimmer was not licensed or not in good 

standing  in  Pennsylvania.  Instead,  the  trial  court  disqualified  Attorney 

Wimmer based on its own finding that Attorney Wimmer had violated certain 

provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct. 

 

There  is  no  question  that  the  trial  court  possessed  the  power  to 

disqualify  Attorney  Wimmer  upon  finding  that  she  violated  the  Rules  of 

Professional Conduct. See Darrow, 266 A.3d at 1111. However, that power 

was severely limited: “disqualification is appropriate only when both another 

remedy for the violation is not available and it is essential to ensure that the 

party seeking disqualification receives the fair trial that due process requires.” 

Id.1 Accordingly, we may affirm the order disqualifying Attorney Wimmer only 

if: (1) there was no other remedy available for her violations, and (2) there 

was no other way to ensure the Commonwealth’s right to a fair trial. 

 

To  address  both  prongs,  we  must  review  the  conduct  the  trial  court 

found  to  be  in  violation  of  the  Rules.  First,  the  court  found  that  Attorney 

Wimmer  had  made  public  statements  on  CBS  attacking  the  prosecuting 

____________________________________________ 

1  Gonzalez-Lopez  arguably  introduces  some  worry  about  how  the  second 
part  of  the  Darrow  test  applies  here.  However,  as  we  conclude  that  the 
Commonwealth failed to establish the requirements of the Darrow test, we 
do not reach the issue of whether Gonzalez-Lopez imposes a higher standard 
when  the  Commonwealth  seeks  to  disqualify  a  criminal  defendant’s  chosen 
counsel.

officer’s  character  and  credibility.  See  Trial  Court  Opinion,  6/13/22,  at  11.2 

The court also found that Attorney Wimmer had published the body camera 

footage on CBS knowing that it would be inadmissible at trial. See id., at 12. 

The  court  concluded  that  Attorney  Wimmer’s  “actions  fall  squarely  into  the 

prohibited  actions  as  enumerated  in  both  Rule  3.6  …  and  the  comments 

thereto[.]” Id., at 11.  

In general, Rule 3.6 prohibits lawyers involved in a case from making 

public statements that “have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing 

an  adjudicative  proceeding  in  the  matter.”  Pa.R.P.C.  3.6.  Further,  the 

comment to the Rule clarifies that public statements regarding the character 

or credibility of a witness are “more likely than not to have a prejudicial effect 

on  a  proceeding.”  Pa.R.P.C.  3.6,  cmt.  Further,  publication  of  prejudicial 

information about the case that would be inadmissible at trial is also clearly 

prohibited by the Rule. See id.   

The trial court’s factual findings are supported by the record. And Lewis 

has not made any serious attempt to challenge these findings on appeal. See 

____________________________________________ 

2  The  trial  judge  in  this  matter  has  since  retired.  The  1925(a)  opinion  was 
prepared  by  a  different  judge.  Importantly,  it  is  the  retired  trial  judge’s 
reasoning,  and  not  the  reasoning  of  the  judge  who  prepared  the  1925(a) 
opinion, which controls. See In Interests of M.W., 194 A.3d 1094, 1097 n.1 
(Pa. Super. 2018). However, our review of the 1925(a) opinion reveals that it 
accurately  and  correctly  sets  forth  the  reasoning  utilized  by  the  trial  judge. 
We discern no conflict between the two analyses; rather, the 1925(a) opinion 
does  no  more  than  provide  a  thorough  explanation  of  the  trial  judge’s 
reasoning. 

- 7 - 

J-A28035-22 

Appellant’s Brief, at 11 (“True as it may be that Ms. Wimmer participated in 

unfortunate pretrial publicity about this case…”); see also N.T., 7/15/20, at 

12  (counsel  for  Attorney  Wimmer  arguing  “the  right  to  counsel  should 

outweigh whatever errors a young lawyer might have made in being a little 

too zealous in her representation.”).  

However,  as  noted  above,  that  conclusion  is  not  co-extensive  with  a 

conclusion that  the  trial court was empowered to override Lewis’s choice of 

counsel.  While  a  court  may  disqualify  counsel  for  violations  of  the  Rules  of 

Professional  Conduct,  it  cannot  do  so  merely  to  punish  counsel  for  the 

violation.  See  Estate  of  Pedrick,  482  A.2d  215,  221  (Pa.  1984).  The  trial 

court does not have the general power to sanction attorneys pursuant to the 

Rules  of  Professional  Conduct.  See  id.;  see  also  Pennsylvania  Rules  of 

Professional Conduct, Preamble and Scope, ¶ 19 (“The Rules are designed to 

… provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies.”). 

Therefore, as noted above, the court could only disqualify Attorney Wimmer 

for a violation of the Rules if it were essential to protect the Commonwealth’s 

right to a fair trial and no other remedy could accomplish the same result. See 

Darrow, 266 A.3d at 1111. 

Here, the trial court concluded that 

[t]here  is  no  question  that  the  release  of  officer  worn  body 
cameras  to  CBS  and  [Attorney]  Wimmer’s  interview  with  CBS 
placed  the  fairness  and  integrity  of  the  defendant’s  trial 
undoubtedly in jeopardy. As succinctly stated, and adopted by this 
court, the [trial judge] found, 
 

- 8 - 

J-A28035-22 

[t]here’s  a  lot  more  detail  that  I  could  get  into,  but 
essentially  looking  at  the  interest  of  justice  and  the 
disgraceful, unethical behavior of the attorney attempting 
to taint the jury pool by putting out irrelevant information 
that a jury would never see, and further by trying to scare 
the police into making a different offer, it is so over the top 
and  outrageous  that  I  am  convinced  that  a  fair  jury  trial 
can’t [exist] with[Attorney] Wimmer in the case. 
 

Trial Court Opinion, 6/13/22, at 13. The trial court concluded its reasoning by 

stating that it thought Attorney Wimmer’s conduct had “influenced this case 

so  much  that  [Attorney]  Wimmer  should  no  longer  be  a  part  of  it.”  N.T., 

7/15/20, at 58.  

 

We find two sources of error in the trial court’s explicit reasoning. First, 

the trial court’s reasoning was focused primarily on Attorney Wimmer’s past 

conduct.  Such  past-focused  reasoning  is  an  indicator  of  punitive  intent. 

Second, the court’s reasoning was focused on the outrageousness of Attorney 

Wimmer’s conduct, not on whether Attorney Wimmer was likely to continue 

acting in ways that would prejudice the Commonwealth’s right to a fair trial. 

In  fact,  the  defense  team  agreed  that  the  issues  underlying  the 

Commonwealth’s motion to disqualify would be irrelevant at trial:3 

____________________________________________ 

3  Attorney  Wimmer  had  counsel,  Samuel  Stretton,  Esq.,  to  represent  her 
interests  at  the  hearing  on  the  Commonwealth’s  motion  to  disqualify.  See 
N.T., 7/15/20, at 3 (Counsel stating “as you know, I’m here not as Mr. Lewis’ 
attorney but as Ms. Wimmer’s”).  Attorney Wimmer was not a party to any 
matter relevant to the hearing, and the Rules prohibit counsel from acting as 
both  advocate  and  witness  in  a  proceeding.  See  Pa.R.P.C.  3.7.  The 
Commonwealth had a second prosecutor acting as advocate at the hearing, 
allowing the former lead prosecutor, A.D.A. Matteson, to testify in support of

trial. 

S. WIMMER:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

R. STRETTON:  That is correct. Ms. Wimmer can speak for herself 

on that. 

HE COURT:  All right. 

Prosecutor:]  Your Honor, the second motion is a motion in limine 
to  exclude  any  information  regarding  the  affiant  or  one  of  the 
officers in this case, … to exclude a 1998 unrelated incident as not 
being relevant to this case. 

And the other aspect of that motion is the Commonwealth’s 
motion  to  exclude  any  comments  in  the  BearCat  by  unnamed 
officers and also Detective Trautmann as being not relevant in this 
case. My understanding is that there is an agreement with respect 
to that motion as well. 

R. STRETTON:  That is correct. Your honor, we agree to it with 
the exception that if somehow a door would be opened up during 
trial – presumably it wouldn’t be – then we would go to side bar 
and ask for you to reconsider. Other than that, we agree. 

HE COURT:  All right. Do you represent Mr. Lewis?

the  motion  to  disqualify.  And  A.D.A  Matteson  did  not  continue  to  act  as  an 
advocate in this matter after testifying. As demonstrated in the transcript of 
proceedings  set  forth  more  fully  below,  it  is  unclear  whether  the  trial  court 
appreciated the quandary Attorney Wimmer faced at this hearing: testify in 
her defense, thereby disqualifying herself from further advocacy in this matter 
under Rule 3.7, or allow the Commonwealth to present the only evidence of 
record  regarding  one-on-one  conversations  between  herself  and  A.D.A. 
Matteson.  This  hearing  demonstrated  many  of  the  dangers  the  Rules  of 
Professional Conduct seek to avoid by reserving disciplinary proceedings for a 
separate venue.

MR. STRETTON:  No. I represent his attorney. 

HE COURT:  All right. Well, this is about Mr. Lewis. I’m going to 

ask that you be quiet, please. 

R. STRETTON:  All right. 

S. WIMMER:  Judge, that is correct as Mr. Stretton stated. I have 
no objection to the Commonwealth’s motion unless and until one 
of  the  witnesses  opens  the  door  to  its  admission  or  something 
relevant in the BearCat, at which time it would be an evidentiary 
ruling for trial.

of it was relevant?

N.T., 7/15/20, at 5-7. 

J-A28035-22 

 

Therefore,  before  the  motion  to  disqualify  was  addressed,  Attorney 

Wimmer had agreed not to make any more public statements about the case, 

and further, that evidence of the prosecuting officer’s disciplinary history, as 

well  as  the  body  camera  footage,  were  not  relevant  at  trial  unless  the 

Commonwealth presented testimony that made them relevant. These issues 

therefore could not have been valid bases for the trial court to conclude that 

disqualification was essential to preserve the Commonwealth’s right to a fair 

trial.  

 

The  trial  court  also  opined  that  disqualification  was  necessary  as 

otherwise, Attorney Wimmer would be subject to “some personal vendetta or 

personal  desire  to  prove  her  own  innocence  and  avoid  any  other  collateral 

- 11 - 

J-A28035-22 

consequences.” N.T., 7/15/20, at 57.  However, we cannot find any basis in 

the  record  to  support  this  conclusion.  There  was  no  evidence,  beyond  the 

Commonwealth’s allegation that it planned on filing a disciplinary complaint, 

that  disciplinary  proceedings  had  been  initiated.4  And  the  Commonwealth’s 

complaint,  if it were ever actually filed,  would not, on its  own, be sufficient 

grounds to disqualify Attorney Wimmer. To hold otherwise would give every 

adverse  party  the  power  of  veto  in  the  choice  of  counsel  merely  by  filing  a 

disciplinary  complaint  against  an  opposing  attorney.  Further,  given  that 

Attorney  Wimmer  had  conceded  that  the  evidence  at  issue  was,  in  fact, 

irrelevant absent an intervening circumstance, there was nothing for Attorney 

Wimmer to “prove” regarding her own innocence or lack thereof. Finally, bad 

feelings between opposing advocates, however unfortunate, are a fact of the 

adversarial system. What matters is not whether the advocates dislike each 

other, but whether  they perform their professional duties  in a  civil  manner. 

On  that  note,  there  is  no  evidence  showing  that  Attorney  Wimmer  or  the 

Commonwealth could not fulfill their professional duties going forward. 

 

While the trial court did not explicitly  conclude that Attorney Wimmer 

had tainted the jury pool, we note for the sake of completeness that the record 

____________________________________________ 

4  In  Commonwealth  v.  Selenski,  No.  904  MDA  2015,  2016  WL  5745642 
(Pa.  Super.  filed  August  11,  2016)  (unpublished  memorandum),  appeal 
denied,  156  A.3d  334  (Pa.  2017),  we  affirmed  the  trial  court’s  decision  to 
disqualify defense counsel.  However, aside from being non-precedential, that 
case is factually distinguishable because there, defense counsel had already 
been criminally charged for actions taken while representing the defendant.

does  not  support  such  a  finding.  Pretrial  publicity  must  be  inflammatory  in 

nature and sustained and pervasive in the local community in order to justify 

a presumption that jurors cannot perform their duties fairly and impartially. 

See Commonwealth v. Walter, 119 A.3d 255, 269 (Pa. 2015). Whether or 

not the CBS television segments were  inflammatory, we fail to see how the 

two broadcasts on one station in the local community qualified as sustained 

and pervasive. In any event, during jury selection before the trial, only one 

potential juror indicated they had previous knowledge of the case: 

JUROR NO. 43:  I feel like I did read something about this when it 
first occurred. But that’s all I can recall. 

HE  COURT:    And  would  it  interfere  with  your  ability  to  try  the 

case fairly and impartially? 

UROR NO. 43:  No, because I can’t recall as much as I … 

HE COURT:  Very good. Thank you. 

N.T., 9/13/2021, at 54-55.  

 

In sum, we conclude that the record does not support the trial court’s 

conclusion that disqualification of Attorney Wimmer was necessary to protect 

the  Commonwealth’s  fair  trial  rights.  Lewis’s  Sixth  Amendment  rights  to 

private  counsel  of  his  choosing  cannot  be  overborne  under  these 

circumstances. As this constitutes a structural error, we are therefore required 

to vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial. 

 

Judgment  of  sentence  vacated.  Case  remanded  for  a  new  trial. 

Jurisdiction relinquished.
