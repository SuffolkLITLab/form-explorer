he  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania,  Department  of  Transportation 

(DOT) appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County (trial 

court) dated February 25, 2022.  The trial court denied DOT’s post-trial motion for 

a new trial in an eminent domain matter in which the jury awarded $3,189,677 in 

damages to Niki D’ Atri Enterprises, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation doing business 

as  Crows  Run  Recycling  (Crows  Run),  for  the  value  in  place  of  salvage  yard 

inventory.    DOT  contends  that  the  jury  was  improperly  allowed  to  consider  lost 

profits in its award.  Upon review, we affirm the trial court’s order.

I. Background 

In April 2016, DOT filed a declaration of taking in order  to effect a 

condemnation  of  real  property  in  connection  with  a  state  road  upgrade  project.  

Crows Run operated a salvage yard as a tenant on the affected real property, which 

its principal, Niki D’ Atri (D’ Atri), owned personally.  See Reproduced Record 

(RR) at 10a.  DOT concedes the salvage yard business was not relocated.  See DOT 

Br. at 12.  Therefore, Section 902(b)(1) of the Eminent Domain Code,1 26 Pa.C.S. 

§  902(b)(1),  requires  DOT  to  pay  the  value  in  place  of  Crows  Run’s  inventory, 

machinery, and equipment. 

D’  Atri  testified  at  a  hearing  before  a  board  of  viewers  that  the  fair 

market  value  of  the  inventory  was  $10,374,874.61  and  the  market  value  of  the 

machinery and equipment was $487,045.00.  RR at 11a & 18a.  By contrast, Charles 

Dixon (Dixon), a certified appraiser testifying as DOT’s expert witness, opined that 

the inventory’s value in place was $215,875.00 and the value of the machinery and 

equipment was $292,935.00.  Id. at 14a.  The board of viewers awarded a total of 

$600,000.00 for the inventory, machinery, and equipment.  Id. at 22a. 

Crows Run appealed to the trial court, which held a jury trial in October 

2021.    D’  Atri  renewed  his  assertion  of  value  of  the  inventory  and  presented  an 

itemization  of  his  asserted  valuation  of  each  recoverable  part  on  each  of  1,187 

disabled vehicles in the salvage yard.  RR at 308a-16a & 541a-6578a.  DOT objected 

to  D’  Atri’s  evidence  on  the  basis  that  it  included  lost  profits,  but  the  trial  court 

overruled the objection.  Id. at 315a-16a.  The trial court also denied DOT’s proposed 

jury instruction seeking to preclude consideration of lost profits in calculating the 

inventory’s value.  Id. at 30a & 372a-73a. 

1 26 Pa.C.S. §§ 101-1106. 

 

2 
 

 

The jury awarded $3,189,677.00 for the inventory and $389,990.50 for 

the machinery and equipment.  RR at 188a.  The trial court denied DOT’s post-trial 

motion and affirmed the jury’s verdict.  DOT then appealed to this Court.  On appeal, 

DOT challenges only the valuation of the inventory. 

 

II. Issue 

DOT acknowledges that Crows Run was entitled to recover the original 

costs  or  replacement  costs  of  the  disabled  vehicles  and  any  parts  that  had  been 

removed from those vehicles and readied for sale.  However, DOT posits that the 

method used by D’ Atri to calculate the inventory value included a markup and, as 

such, included lost profits.   DOT asserts that the trial court committed reversible 

error  by  admitting  evidence  of  Crows  Run’s  lost  profits,  contrary  to  Section 

902(b)(1) of the Eminent Domain Code and related relocation assistance regulations, 

as  well  as  by  refusing  to  provide  a  jury  instruction  forbidding  an  award  of  lost 

profits.2 

 

2 Regarding challenges to evidentiary rulings, our Supreme Court has explained: 

[E]videntiary rulings are within the sound discretion of trial courts 
. . . .  Accordingly, when a party adverse to a trial court’s evidentiary 
ruling seeks appellate review of that determination, that party carries 
a  heavy  burden  to  demonstrate  that  the  trial  court  abused  its 
discretion  .  .  .  .   An  appellant  cannot  meet  this  burden  by  simply 
persuading an appellate court that it may have reached a different 
conclusion [from] that reached by the trial court; rather, to overcome 
this heavy burden, the appellant must demonstrate that the trial court 
actually abused its discretionary power. 

Regarding the “abuse of discretion standard” of review, this Court 
has  explained  that  the  term  “discretion”  imports  the  exercise  of 
judgment,  wisdom  and  skill  so  as  to  reach  a  dispassionate 
conclusion, within the framework of the law, and is not exercised 
for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the [trial] judge . . . .

III. Discussion 

Section 902(b)(1)(i) of the Eminent Domain Code provides: 

A  displaced  person  who  is  displaced  from  a  place  of 
business  or  from  a  farm  operation  shall  be  entitled,  in 
addition to any payment received under subsection (a), to 
damages for dislocation of business or farm operation as 
follows: 

(1)  Damages  equal  to  the  value  in  place  of  the 
personal property which: 

(i) 
the 
is  not  moved  because  of 
discontinuance  of  the  business  or  farm 
operation  or 
the  unavailability  of  a 
comparable site for relocation . . . . 

Original  cost  of  personal  property  to  the  displaced 
person—The amount paid by the displaced person for the 

 

Absent  an  abuse  of  that  discretion,  an  appellate  court  should  not 
disturb a trial court’s discretionary ruling . . . .  An appellate court 
will  not  find  an  abuse  of  discretion  based  on  a  mere  error  of 
judgment,  but  rather  .  .  .  where  the  [trial]  court  has  reached  a 
conclusion  which  overrides  or  misapplies  the  law,  or  where  the 
judgment  exercised  is  manifestly  unreasonable,  or  the  result  of 
partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will. 

26  Pa.C.S.  §  902(b)(1)(i).    A  related  regulation  provides  the  following  pertinent 

definitions: 

Commonwealth  v.  Distefano,  265  A.3d  290,  297-98  (Pa.  2021)  (internal  quotation  marks  and 
citations omitted). 

Regarding  challenges  to  jury  instructions,  “a  trial  judge  has  wide  latitude  in  his  or  her 
choice  of  language  when  charging  a  jury,  provided  always  that  the  court  fully  and  adequately 
conveys the applicable law.”  Hall v. Jackson, 788 A.2d 390, 399 (Pa. 2001) (quoting Wilson v. 
Anderson, 616 A.2d 34, 36 (Pa. Super. 1992) (additional quotation marks omitted)).  This Court’s 
review of a trial court’s jury instructions is limited to determining whether the trial court abused 
its discretion or committed an error of law; even if the trial court erred in its jury instructions, we 
will not award a new trial “unless the jury charge in its entirety was unclear, inadequate, or tended 
to mislead or confuse the jury.”  Hall, 788 A.2d at 399 (quoting Fragale v. Brigham, 741 A.2d 
788, 790 (Pa. Super. 1999) (additional quotation marks omitted)).

37 Pa. Code § 151.1. 

 

 

A. Replacement Cost and Profit 

DOT’s first assertion of error relates to the evidence Crows Run offered 

at  trial  concerning  its  damages.    Crows  Run  asserts  that  replacement  cost  is  the 

proper valuation of its inventory.  To support its claim, Crows Run relies largely on 

Pikur Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Transportation, 641 A.2d 11 (Pa. Cmwlth. 

1994).    In  Pikur,  a  property  owner  was  in  the  business  of  servicing  corporate 

automobile fleets.  In the course of providing those services, Pikur accumulated an 

inventory of automobile parts that it removed from the corporate vehicles; thus, that 

inventory  was  acquired  at  no  cost.    Id.  at  12.    When  DOT  exercised  its  eminent 

domain powers for a road project, Pikur could not relocate its business and sought 

payment for the value of its inventory.  Id. at 14.  DOT argued that Pikur could not 

recover  more  than  the  original  cost  of  the  inventory,  which  was  zero;  but  the 
5 
 

common pleas court allowed evidence of replacement cost, and this Court affirmed.3  

Id.    Here,  based  on  Pikur,  Crows  Run  argues  that  the  cost  of  the  vehicles  is  not 

reflective of the value in place of the numerous saleable parts in each vehicle. 

There is no dispute that Crows Run is entitled to the value in place of 

its personal property, including its parts inventory.  See 26 Pa.C.S. § 902(b)(1).  As 

set  forth  above,  the  “value  in  place”  is  determined  “considering  such  factors  as 

original cost, delivery and installation costs, physical and economic depreciation and 

functional obsolescence.”  37 Pa. Code § 151.1.  Further, “[i]n the event of personal 

property  which  was  obtained  without  cost  or  for  which  there  are  no  records,  the 

replacement cost of equivalent property at the time of sale shall be used.”  Id.  

Pikur is not directly on point because, there, the inventory had no cost.  

Here, the cost of Crows Run’s parts inventory was subsumed in the purchase price 

of each vehicle; it was not zero.  Thus, the parts inventory here was not “obtained 

without cost.”  37 Pa. Code § 151.1.   

However,  D’  Atri  testified  he  did  not  have  records  documenting  the 

purchase price of each vehicle in his inventory and did not know the specific price 

he paid for each.  RR at 319a-21a.  If the jury credited that testimony, then the parts 

inventory constituted  personal property “for which there  are no records.”   37 Pa. 

Code § 151.1.  That would allow Crows Run to recover replacement costs of the 

inventory.  Id. 

 

3 This Court also discerned no abuse of discretion in the common pleas court’s exclusion 
of Pikur’s tax returns, which DOT sought to offer as evidence of the salvage value of inventory 
items acquired without cost; we concluded that the nominal salvage value shown in the tax returns 
was  not  probative  because  it  was  “not  reflective  of  actual  value  in  place  as  defined  in  the 
regulations . . . .”  Pikur Enters., Inc. v. Dep’t of Transp., 641 A.2d 11, 14 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1994).  
However, the Court did not hold that lost profits could be included in actual value.  See id.  

 

6 
 

Nonetheless,  assuming  that  Crows  Run  was  entitled  to  recover 

replacement cost, most of its evidence at trial related to calculating replacement costs 

in terms of its resale prices for individual parts.  Despite D’ Atri’s insistence to the 

contrary, those calculations clearly included profit.  For example, Crows Run sought 

to  recover  $6,500  as  replacement  cost  of  the  parts  in  a  Chevrolet  Cavalier  it 

purchased for $1,000 plus $200 in transport costs; on cross-examination regarding 

his calculation of replacement cost, D’ Atri testified as follows: 

So for a vehicle like that, you have 1,200 bucks in 

Q. 
it; right? 

A.  Um-hum. 

Q.  And, now that tells me, tell me if I’m correct, that if 
someone had come into your shop and bought that vehicle 
for 1,200 bucks, you would have broke [sic] even? 

A. 

Bought the vehicle for 1,200? 

Q.   For 1,200.  Your objective was to make money on 
the vehicle, of course? 

A.  Yes. 

But I’m saying, you could have sold that vehicle for 
Q. 
$1,200 and not lost money?  You just wouldn’t have made 
any money? 

A.  Wouldn’t have made any money. 

Q.  Okay.    So,  so  when  you  sell  it  to  []DOT  or  you 
charge  []DOT  $6,500  and  change,  you’re  selling  it  to 
[]DOT at, if my math is correct, 5,2- [sic] or $5,300 above 
what you could have sold it for and what you could have 
broke [sic] even with? 

A.  Well, so the $5,000 profit on that particular car, the 
Cavalier we’re talking about, I was going through my parts 
inventory  and  putting  the  fair  market  value  in  place  to 
those  parts.   So  the number  that  I  came up  with  on that 
Cavalier  that  equaled  6,000 wasn’t  a  profit  of,  it  wasn’t 
7 
 

 

intended for a profit.  Those were actual, my costs if I had 
to replace them. 

Q.  Now,  the,  what  you  were  using  were  your  sales 
figures from the year before.  So what you did is you, and 
again, these are questions.  You took, basically on paper 
you  cannibalized  the  car  and  added  up  what  you  could 
have sold the parts for? 

A. 

Added up what I could sell the parts for, yes. 

RR  at  320a  (emphasis  added).    Indeed,  in  a  sidebar  conference  out  of  the  jury’s 

hearing,  counsel  for  Crows  Run  argued,  in  support  of  allowing  replacement  cost 

evidence based on selling price, “Say[] I sold this property for X number of dollars, 

which includes profit as does any business, and I’m utilizing comparable sales in this 

case, and that’s exactly what’s happened here.”  RR at 315a-16a (emphasis added). 

A “profit” is, 

most  commonly,  the  gross  proceeds  of  a  business 
transaction,  less  the  costs  of  the  transaction;  i.e.,  net 
proceeds.    Excess  of  revenues  over  expenses  for  a 
transaction;  sometimes  used  synonymously  with  net 
income  for  the  period.    Gain  realized  from  business  or 
investment  over  and  above  expenditures.  Profit  means 
accession of good, valuable results, useful consequences, 
avail,  gain,  as  in  office  of  profit,  excess  of  returns  over 
expenditures, or excess of income over expenditure. 

Del.  Cnty.  v.  First  Union  Corp.,  929  A.2d  1258,  1263  n.14  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  2007) 

(quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1090 (5th ed. 1979) (quotation marks omitted)).  

As discussed above, Crows Run’s evidence of replacement cost was mainly based 

on its retail selling prices.  D’ Atri, as the principal of Crows Run, conceded that he 

bought the vehicles to sell the parts and make a profit.  RR at 321a.  Therefore, those 

prices  undeniably  included  an  “accession  of  good,  valuable  results,  useful 

consequences,  avail,  gain,  .  .  .  excess  of  returns  over  expenditures,  or  excess  of 

 

8 
 

income over expenditure.”  Del. Cnty., 929 A.2d at 1263 n.14 (quoting Black’s Law 

Dictionary).  We agree with DOT that Crows Run’s retail selling prices included an 

unspecified amount of profit. 

In  opposing  the  position  of  Crows  Run,  DOT  relies  on  Cox  v. 

Philadelphia, Harrisburg & Pittsburg4 Railroad Company, 64 A. 729 (Pa. 1906).  In 

Cox, a railroad took by eminent domain part of a piece of farm property that was 

used for raising ducks.  In valuing the land taken, the owner argued that the reduction 

in  size  of  the  property  reduced  by  2,000  the  number  of  ducks  he  could  raise, 

contending that he was entitled to 25 years of profits lost on 2,000 ducks per year.  

Id.  at  731.    Our  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the  testimony  of  the  plaintiff’s 

witnesses  “clearly  showed  that  their  valuation  of  the  property  for  [duck  farm] 

purposes  rested  upon  a[n]  erroneous  basis,  the  profits  which  the  plaintiff  would 

realize out of the business conducted upon the land.”  Id. at 730.  The Court cited as 

long-settled law the principle “which prohibits the landowner from having the profits 

of his business considered by the jury in determining the value of the property . . . ,” 

observing that “[w]e have so often said . . . that the profits of business could not be 

recovered in condemnation proceedings that it seems like a waste of time to cite the 

decisions.”  Id. (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). 

Although Cox is not factually on point, we agree with DOT that lost 

profits may not be included in calculating replacement cost.  Thus, we conclude that 

 

4  In 1891, the United States Board on Geographic Names (Board) decided to standardize 
geographic  names,  including  dropping  the  final  “h”  from  any  name  ending  in  “burgh.” 
https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52943/how-pittsburgh-got-its-h-back-and-7-other-geographic-
naming-oddities (last visited Mar. 16, 2023).  Pittsburgh, however, had been named by General 
John Forbes, whose Scottish background was the reason for the spelling; to the city’s residents, 
“[t]o edit the spelling to the German ‘burg’ was akin to editing the city’s founding.”  Id.  In 1911, 
the city finally prevailed on the Board to return to the original spelling.  Id.  The cited case, as its 
date indicates, was decided during the period before the city regained the “h” in its name. 

 

9 
 

D’ Atri’s evidence asserting a total replacement cost of $10,374,874.61 in inventory 

was  improper  to  the  extent  that  figure  was  based  on  retail  sales  prices,  which 

necessarily included profit. 

 

B. Requested Jury Instruction Regarding Profit 

DOT’s second assertion of error relates to the trial court’s charge to the 

jury.    DOT  requested  that  the  trial  court’s  jury  instructions  include  Pennsylvania 

Standard Civil Jury instruction 22.100, which provides:   

For  business  condemnees,  the  value  of  lost  profits  as  a 
result of a taking must not be considered as a separate item 
of  damage  in  measuring  just  compensation  for  the 
condemnee.   

A qualified valuation expert may, however, consider the 
loss of income to a  business only to the extent that it is 
relevant to determining the effect of the condemnation on 
the real estate. 

Pa. SSJI (Civ) 22.100; RR at 30a.  The trial court declined to give that instruction, 

reasoning that the evidence had not included lost profits, but only replacement costs.  

RR at 373a.  Instead, the trial court then gave the following valuation instruction:  

Just  compensation  is  the  difference  between  the  fair 
market  value  of  the  property  in  question  immediately 
before the government took the property and as unaffected 
by  the  taking  and  the  fair  market  value  of  the  property 
remaining  immediately  after  the  taking  and  as  it  was 
affected by it. 

Those are the damages you have to assess here.  There is 
no dispute that damages occurred.  It will be up to you to 
decide what that damage is based upon the evidence. 

And that brings us to what we call the fair market value. 
The fair market value is the price that would be agreed to 
by a willing and informed seller and buyer . . . . 

 

10 
 

Id. at 397a.  DOT maintains that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury 

that it could not award lost profits. 

In determining whether the trial court erred in its jury instructions, we 

must consider the jury charge as a whole, in light of the evidence presented.  Volponi 

v. Bristol, 551 A.2d 657, 660 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1988) (citation omitted).  Here, D’ Atri 

insisted  in  his  testimony  that  he  was  not  seeking  to  recover  lost  profits,  merely 

replacement costs.  RR at 320a & 322a.  In light of D’ Atri’s repeated statements 

that  Crows  Run  was  not  asking  to  recover  its  lost  profits,  the  trial  court,  in  its 

discretion,  declined  to  instruct  the  jury  not  to  award  them.    However,  the  jury 

instruction the trial court actually gave spoke in terms of the price a willing buyer 

would pay a willing seller, which could well include a profit to the seller.  Thus, the 

trial  court’s  instruction  could  have  misled  and  confused  the  jury.    We  therefore 

conclude that, considering the jury charge as a whole, the trial court erred by refusing 

to instruct the jury not to award lost profits. 

 

C. Request for a New Trial 

As discussed in Section A above, we conclude that the trial court erred 

by allowing replacement cost evidence that necessarily included profits, and then 

declining to give a jury instruction precluding an award of lost profits.  However, 

our analysis does not end there.  Errors by the trial court do not automatically entitle 

the moving party to a new trial.  This Court has explained:   

A party requesting a new trial must demonstrate in what 
way trial error caused an incorrect result . . . .  Determining 
whether the moving party is entitled to a new trial involves 
a two-step process . . . .  First, we must decide whether one 
or more mistakes occurred at trial and, if so, whether the 
mistake is a sufficient basis for granting a new trial . . . .  

 

11 
 

The moving party must demonstrate more than harmless 
error; the mistake will be a sufficient basis for granting a 
new trial where the party demonstrates prejudice resulting 
from the mistake . . . . 

Zenak  v.  Police  Ath.  League  of  Phila.,  132  A.3d  541,  553  (Pa.  Cmwlth.  2016) 

(quoting  Dep’t  of  Gen.  Servs.  v.  U.S.  Min.  Prods.  Co.,  927  A.2d  717,  723  (Pa. 

Cmwlth. 2007), aff’d, 956 A.2d 967 (Pa. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  

Thus,  DOT,  as  the  party  seeking  a  new  trial,  had  the  burden  of  demonstrating 

prejudice arising from the trial court’s errors in admitting valuation evidence that 

implicitly included profits and then refusing to instruct the jury not to award such 

profits as damages.  

Crows  Run  asserted  that  its  inventory  had  a  total  value  of  

$10,374,874.61,  RR  at  11a,  which,  as  discussed  above,  included  an  unspecified 

amount of profit.  DOT’s valuation expert opined that the vehicles had only scrap 

value, totaling $139,000, and that the entire inventory had a value of $215,875.00.  

Id. at 14a, 380a & 383a.  The jury awarded $3,189,677.  See id. at 188a.  Clearly, 

the  jury  was  not  fully  persuaded  either  by  Crows  Run’s  evidence  concerning 

replacement costs or DOT’s evidence of scrap value. 

At trial, D’ Atri testified concerning the approximate purchase prices 

of the vehicles he bought in order to acquire his parts inventory.  He stated that prices 

varied from $300 to as much as $8,000 but were typically in the range of $1,000 to 

$3,000.  RR at 319a & 321a.  He also testified to additional costs of about $200 per 

vehicle  for  transporting  purchased  vehicles  and  preparing  them  for  storage,  plus 

labor  costs  associated  with  pulling  and  cleaning  the  loose  parts  that  were  in  the 

inventory.    RR  at  320a-21a.    The  jury’s  award  of  $3,189,677  amounted  to  about 

$2,687 for each of the 1187 vehicles, well within the price range D’ Atri testified 

 

12 
 

was the average purchase price he paid for vehicles, even without separating out the 

extra costs of transportation and labor.   

Thus, the  jury’s award  appears to be consistent with the evidence of 

average vehicle cost.  As such, it does not indicate inclusion of profits.  We conclude 

that DOT has not met its burden of showing prejudice resulting from the trial court’s 

error.  Thus, no new trial is merited. 

IV. Conclusion 

Based on the  foregoing discussion, we conclude that the trial court’s 

errors in allowing evidence of prices including profit and then failing to instruct the 

jury not to award lost profits were harmless.  Accordingly, the trial court’s order is 

affirmed.
