v. 

OPINION BY BOWES, J.: 

FILED MARCH 20, 2023 

 

Chris  Taylor  appeals  from  the  October  15,  2021  order  sustaining  the 

preliminary  objections  of  the  Pennsylvania  State  Corrections  Officers 

Association  (“PSCOA”)  as  to  Mr.  Taylor’s  claim  under  the  Declaratory 

Judgments Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 7531-41, which sought a legal determination 

Appeal from the Order Entered October 15, 2021 
In the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon County Civil Division at 
No(s):  2021-688 

EFORE:   BOWES, J., McCAFFERY, J., and STEVENS, P.J.E.* 

  B

that PSCOA had violated its duty of fair representation.  We affirm. 

 

The  underlying  facts  of  this  matter  are  undisputed.    Mr.  Taylor  is 

employed by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections at SCI-Huntingdon 

in a bargaining unit represented by PSCOA.  Mr. Taylor was a member of this 

labor union until June 2019, when he and several of his colleagues resigned 

from  PSCOA  in  response  to  the  United  States  Supreme  Court’s  holding  in 

Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 2448, 2486 (2018),

which  established  that  “public-sector  unions  may  no  longer  extract  agency 

fees from nonconsenting employees” under the First Amendment to the United 

States  Constitution.    Despite  his  resignation,  PSCOA  remains  Mr.  Taylor’s 

“exclusive  representative”  pursuant  to  the  Public  Employe  Relations  Act 

(“PERA”), 43 P.S. §§ 1101.101-.2301.1  See 43 P.S. § 1101.606.  Accordingly, 

PSCOA  remains  obligated  under  Pennsylvania  law  “to  bargain  on  wages, 

hours,  terms  and  conditions  of  employment”  upon  Mr.  Taylor’s  behalf.    Id.  

Furthermore,  both  parties  agree  PSCOA  has  an  ongoing  duty  under  the 

relevant  collective  bargaining  agreement  (“CBA”)  to  submit  employment 

grievances on Mr. Taylor’s behalf and represent him at related proceedings. 

In  or  about  July  2019,  PSCOA  promulgated  a  schedule  of  fees  in 

connection  with  its  putative  representation  of  non-union  members  like  Mr. 

Taylor in the context of various employment grievances (“the fee schedule”).

In June 2021, Mr. Taylor initiated this declaratory judgment action by 

filing a civil complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon County.2  

See Complaint, 6/23/21, at ¶¶ 1-47.  Therein, he asserted, upon non-specific 

“information and belief,” that PSCOA “will refuse to file a grievance on behalf 

of a nonmember without first receiving payment” as provided in the above-

quoted fee schedule.  Id. at ¶ 20.  Furthermore, Mr. Taylor alleged that the 

fee  schedule  was  instituted  in  “bad  faith”  to  discourage  non-members  of 

PSCOA  from  filing  grievances  and  to  retaliate  against  Mr.  Taylor  and  other 

union resignees.  Id. at ¶¶ 29-31.  Thus, he requested a determination that

2    Our  jurisprudence  suggests  that  claims  in  the  courts  of  common  pleas

equitable in nature.  See Waklet-Riker v. Sayre Educ. Ass’n, 656 A.2d 138,

and arbitration by PSCOA had breached the duty of fair representation under 

Pennsylvania state law.  Id. at ¶¶ 35-47. 

 

PSCOA filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer pursuant 

to  Pa.R.C.P.  1028(a)(4),  arguing  Mr.  Taylor  had  failed  to  allege  a  sufficient 

basis  to  sustain  a  cause  of  action  for  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  fair 

representation.    Specifically,  PSCOA  asserted  that  Mr.  Taylor  had  failed  to 

plead  sufficient  material  facts  in  support  of  his  claims  for  relief.    See 

Preliminary  Objections,  8/18/21,  at  ¶ 34  (“The  instant  [c]omplaint  contains 

no  averment  that  that  PSCOA  acted  in  bad  faith  other  than  the  conclusory 

statement made by [Mr. Taylor.]”).  The trial court held a brief hearing on the 

preliminary objections, wherein Mr. Taylor rested upon the allegations present 

in  his  complaint.    See  N.T.  Hearing,  12/27/21,  at  4  (“I  think  that  the  facts 

here are far from conclusionary. . . .  And there are plenty of paragraphs that 

related to how it is bad faith and discriminatory against non-members.”). 

On  October  15,  2021,  the  trial  court  sustained  PSCOA’s  preliminary 

objections  and  dismissed  Mr.  Taylor’s  complaint  without  prejudice.    Rather 

than amend, on November 9, 2021, Mr. Taylor filed a praecipe to dismiss his 

claims  with  prejudice.    On  November  15,  2021,  he  filed  a  timely  notice  of 

appeal to this Court.  Both Mr. Taylor and the trial court have complied with 

the requirements of Pa.R.A.P. 1925. 

Mr. Taylor has raised a single issue for our review:   

 

Does  a  complaint  allege  sufficient  facts  to  show  that  a  union 
violates its duty to fairly represent all employees when it alleges 
that  the  union  discriminates  against  those  who  are  not  union 

- 4 - 

members, and institutes policies to retaliate against an employee 
it  disfavors,  in  the  administration  of  rights  under  the  collective 
bargaining agreement? 

In reviewing this matter, we bear the following legal principles in mind: 

In  ruling  on  preliminary  objections  in  the  nature  of  a  demurrer, 
the  trial  court  was  required  to  accept  as  true  all  well-pleaded 
allegations of material fact and all reasonable inferences deducible 
from those facts and resolve all doubt in favor of the non-moving 
party.  The question presented was whether, on the facts averred, 
the  law  says  with  certainty  that  no  recovery  is  possible.    When 
any doubt exists as to whether the demurrer should be sustained, 
this doubt should be resolved in favor of overruling it. 

n  appeal  from  the  trial  court’s  order  overruling  preliminary 
objections in the nature of [a] demurrer, our standard of review 
is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.  Hence, we apply 
the  same  standard  as  the  trial  court  in  evaluating  the  legal 
sufficiency of the complaint, and examine whether, on the facts 
averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is possible.

Lomax v. Sullivan, 282 A.3d 790, 792 (Pa.Super. 2022) (cleaned up).  In 

this context, “no testimony or other evidence outside of the complaint may be 

considered to dispose of the legal issues presented by a demurrer.”  Mellon 

Bank, N.A. v. Fabinyi, 650 A.2d 895, 899 (Pa.Super. 1994).  However, “a 

court need not accept as true conclusions of law, unwarranted inferences, or 

expressions of opinion.”  Bayada Nurses, Inc. v. Comm., Dept. of Labor 

and Industry, 8 A.3d 866, 884 (Pa. 2010). 

 

This  case  implicates  the  duty  of  fair  representation,  which  arises 

because “a union acts as a trustee for the rights of its members and employees 

in  the  bargaining  unit.”    Case  v.  Hazelton  Area  Educational  Support

Personnel Ass’n (PSEA/NEA), 928 A.2d 1154, 1158 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2007) (en 

banc).3    Consequently,  “the  members  and  employees  are  beneficiaries  of  a 

fiduciary obligation owed to them by the union,” which the union transgresses 

“when it acts in bad faith toward its members, and violates the fiduciary trust 

created from the principal-agent relationship.”  Case, supra at 1158 (citing 

Falsetti v. Local Union No. 2026, UMWA, 161 A.2d 882, 895 (Pa. 1960)).  

Specifically,  “[a]  union  has  the  duty  to  fairly  represent  its  members 

throughout any grievance and arbitration process provided for by a collective 

bargaining  agreement.”    Miles  v.  FOP  Lodge  #5,  217  A.3d  892,  898-99 

(Pa.Cmwlth.  2019).    A  labor  union  violates  its  duty  if,  in  processing  an 

employee’s grievance, it does “not act in good faith, in a reasonable manner 

and  without  fraud[.]”    Falsetti,  supra  at  895-96.    Finally,  “a  public 

employee’s remedy for his bargaining  agent’s refusal to submit a grievance 

. . . is an action against the union for damages for breach of its duty of fair 

representation.”  Ziccardi v. Comm., 456 A.2d 979, 981 (Pa. 1984). 

 

Mr. Taylor’s arguments are best summarized as follows:  “Pennsylvania 

law  prohibits  a  union  from  discriminating  against  a  nonmember  in  the 

administration  of  rights  under  a  CBA.    And,  in  this  case,  [PSCOA’s]  own 

contract grants rights to all employees it represents.  The Union may not now

condition those rights to nonmembers on newly invented, and illegal, pay-to-

play  fees.”    Appellant’s  brief  at  11-12.    Under  Mr.  Taylor’s  theory,  PSCOA’s 

circulation of the fee schedule is sufficient to demonstrate it has acted in bad 

faith and to retaliate against Mr. Taylor for resigning from the union.   

 

The  scope  of  PSCOA’s  representation  of  Mr.  Taylor  in  the  context  of 

employment grievances emanates from the terms of the CBA, as evidenced 

by the contents of Mr. Taylor’s complaint.  See Complaint, 6/23/21, at ¶¶ 18-

19  (averring  that  PSCOA’s  representation  of  Mr.  Taylor  in  the  context  of 

grievances is governed by “Article 35” of the CBA); Appellant’s brief at 10 (“As 

a  corrections  officer  for  the  Commonwealth,  Mr.  Taylor  is  entitled  to  the 

employments the CBA guarantees to his position.”).  Despite referring to this 

inherently  critical  document  throughout  his  complaint,  Mr.  Taylor  has 

neglected to attach a copy of the CBA to any filing submitted in the trial court.  

Hence,  it  was  not  included  in  the  certified  record  on  appeal.    This  glaring 

oversight creates significant ambiguity with respect to the grievance process 

dictated  by  the  CBA  and,  more  importantly,  the  arguable  impact  of  the  fee 

schedule upon the grievance and arbitration process that PSCOA must follow.  

To  the  extent  Mr.  Taylor  relies  upon  the  CBA  to  support  his  position,  such 

reliance is fruitless due to the deficiency of his pleadings and the record. 

 

As drafted, Mr. Taylor’s claim  for relief  is not grounded in the specific 

terms of his employment.  Rather, his argument is  much more general and 

avers  that  PSCOA  is  precluded,  under  all  circumstances,  from  imposing  the 

- 7 - 

J-A23009-22 

fee schedule.  In staking out this position, he asserts that the union cannot 

treat him any differently from any other employees of the bargaining unit.  Mr. 

Taylor  is  mistaken  on  this  point,  however,  as  it  is  well-established  under 

Pennsylvania law that unions enjoy significant discretion in declining to pursue 

grievances raised by the individuals that they represent: 

Individual bargaining unit members have no absolute right to have 
their  grievances  arbitrated.    Ziccardi  v.  Commonwealth,  456 
A.2d 979, 981 (Pa. 1982).  Rather, a union has broad discretion 
to determine whether to pursue a grievance to arbitration and has 
  Falsetti,  supra 
no  duty  to  arbitrate  every  grievance. 
at 894 n.19. . . .  A wide range of reasonableness must be allowed 
to  a  bargaining  representative  in  serving  the  unit  it  represents, 
subject  always  to  good  faith  and  honesty  of  purpose  in  the 
exercise of this discretion.  See Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 
U.S. 330, 338 (1953).  A union’s actions are arbitrary only if, in 
light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of the union’s 
actions,  the  union’s  behavior  is  so  far  outside  a  wide  range  of 
reasonableness  as  to  be  irrational.    See  Air  Line  Pilots 
Association, International v. O’Neill, 499 U.S. 65, 78 (1991).  
Bad faith, for its part, requires a showing that a union either acted 
in a fraudulent, deceitful, or dishonest manner or with an improper 
motive.  See Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U.S. 
274, 299 (1971). 
 

Anderson  v.  Pleasant  Valley  Educational  Support  Professionals’ 

Assoc., 272 A.3d 999 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2022) (unpublished memorandum at 6).4  

Thus, it is incumbent upon a plaintiff to “plead any material facts upon which 

a claim of bad faith could be based” in the context of an action for an alleged 

breach of the duty of fair representation.  Waklet-Riker v. Sayre Area Educ.

Court I.O.P. § 414(a).

J-A23009-22 

Ass’n,  656  A.2d  138,  141  (Pa.Super.  1995).    A  plaintiff’s  failure  to  allege 

sufficient facts on this required element is “fatal” to their claims.  Id. 

Here, the factual record establishes that Mr. Taylor resigned from PSCOA 

and no longer pays an agency fee to PSCOA.  Approximately one month later, 

PSCOA  issued  the  fee  schedule  and  advised  Mr.  Taylor  that  any  future 

employment  grievances  filed  through  PSCOA  would  be  governed  by  these 

provisions.  These are the only relevant factual averments that Mr. Taylor has 

pleaded  in  support  of  his  allegations  of  breach  of  duty  and  bad  faith.    See 

Complaint,  6/23/21,  at  ¶¶  31.    Thus,  Mr.  Taylor’s  claim  is  that  PSCOA’s 

promulgation  of  the  fee  schedule  is  self-evidently  an  act  of  bad  faith  under 

Pennsylvania law since it constitutes differential treatment.   

As noted above, there is no merit to Appellant’s general contention that 

a union must treat all grievances from the individuals it represents identically.  

See Anderson, supra at 6.  To the contrary, PSCOA is empowered to make 

reasonable assessments with respect to deciding whether to pursue employee 

grievances  based  upon  “the  factual  and  legal  landscape”  at  the  time  of  its 

actions.  Id.  Furthermore, there is no support under Pennsylvania law for Mr. 

Taylor’s broad contention that PSCOA is not permitted to charge ancillary fees 

to non-union members in connection with representing such individuals in the 

context of employment grievances.  Indeed, we note that there is a dearth of 

- 9 - 

J-A23009-22 

on-point  Pennsylvania  precedent  concerning  this  specific  question.5    Under 

such  circumstances,  we  are  permitted  to  “look  to  federal  decisions  for 

guidance” where there is “no meaningful difference” between state and federal 

labor policies.  See, e.g., Burse v. Comm., Pennsylvania Labor Relations 

Board, 425 A.2d 1182, 1184 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1981).  Under this rubric, Janus 

provides substantial guidance here.  In that case, the United States Supreme 

Court concluded that a state’s “extraction of agency fees from nonconsenting 

public-sector employees violates the First Amendment,” overruling Abood v. 

Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977) (permitting mandatory collection of 

5  The holdings  selectively  cited by Mr. Taylor  in support of his position  are 
unavailing  and  inapposite.    See  Appellant’s  brief  at  12-27.    The  only  such 
passage that arguably directly addresses the issue of representing non-union 
members  in  grievances  processes  comes  from  dicta  from  Falsetti  v.  Local 
Union No. 2026, UMWA, 161 A.2d 882 (Pa. 1960), wherein our Supreme 
Court  quoted  the  following  passage  from  a  secondary  source:    “‘The 
bargaining representative would be guilty of a breach of duty if it refused to 
press  a  justifiable  grievance  either  because  of  laziness,  prejudice  or 
unwillingness to spend money on behalf of employees who were not members 
of  the  union.’”    Id.  at  895  n.21  (quoting  Cox,  Individual  Enforcement  of 
Collective  Bargaining  Agreements,  8  Lab.L.J.  850,  858-9  (1957)).    This 
quotation  was  offered  as  an  example  of  the  manner  in  which  certain  legal 
scholars had defined the general scope of the duty of fair representation.  Id. 

ritically, however, Falsetti never explicitly adopted this precise formulation 
with respect to the expenditure of funds on behalf of non-union members and 
no  subsequent  Pennsylvania  court  has  ever  elected  to  do  so.    Thus,  the 
passage cited by Mr. Taylor is mere dicta that boasts no precedential value.  
See  Castellani  v.  Scranton  Times,  L.P.,  124  A.3d  1229,  1243  n.11  (Pa. 
2015).  In light of the authoritative guidance offered by Janus on the matters 
raised by Mr. Taylor, we decline his invitation to elevate this footnote to the 
level of binding precedent under Pennsylvania law.

agency  fees  from  non-members  if  utilized  solely  for  “collective  bargaining, 

contract-administration, and grievance-adjustment purposes”).   

In Janus, the Court also addressed one of the nascent issues posed by 

the holding, namely that public-sector unions like PSCOA would be forced to 

represent non-members like Mr. Taylor in grievance proceedings, as follows: 

the  union’s 

What  about  the  representation  of  nonmembers  in  grievance 
proceedings?  Unions do not undertake this activity solely for the 
benefit  of  nonmembers  .  .  .  .    Representation  of  nonmembers 
furthers 
in  keeping  control  of  the 
administration  of  the  collective-bargaining  agreement,  since  the 
resolution  of  one  employee’s  grievance  can  affect  others.    And 
when a union controls the grievance process, it may, as a practical 
matter,  effectively  subordinate  the  interests  of  an  individual 
employee . . .  to the collective interests of all employees in the 
bargaining unit. 

interest 

n any event, whatever unwanted burden is imposed by the 
representation of nonmembers in disciplinary matters can 
be  eliminated  through  means  significantly  less  restrictive 
of  associational  freedoms  than  the  imposition  of  agency 
fees.  Individual nonmembers could be required to pay for 
that  service  or  could  be  denied  union  representation 
altogether. 

  I

Thus,  while  acknowledging  that  “free  riders”  like  Mr.  Taylor  posed  a 

potential  problem,  the  Court  in  Janus  concluded  that  coercive  agency  fees 

were not a viable solution.  Rather, the Court suggested that the assessment 

of individual fees associated with a union’s representation of a non-member 

in pursuing a grievance is an appropriate, alternative response to this financial 

conundrum.  The above-quoted passage from Janus leads us to conclude that 

there  is  a  distinction  between  shop  agency  fees  assessed  as  an  automatic 

anus, supra at 2468 (cleaned up; emphasis added).

condition  of  a  non-member’s  employment  in  a  bargaining  unit,  and  the 

permissive payment of certain fees in exchange for actual services rendered 

by a public-sector union, i.e., representation in employment grievances and 

arbitrations.6    According  to  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  “[t]his  more 

tailored approach, if applied to other objectors, would prevent free ridership 

while imposing a lesser burden on First Amendment rights.”  Id. at 2468 n.6. 

 

Viewing the totality of the factual and legal landscape of this case, we 

cannot  conclude  that  Mr.  Taylor  has  proffered  material  facts  demonstrating 

that PSCOA has violated the duty of fair representation.  As noted above, it is 

undisputed  that  Mr.  Taylor  chose  to  alienate  himself  from  his  union 

membership  and  elected  to  cease  paying  an  agency  fee  to  PSCOA.    In 

response  to  these  actions,  PSCOA  adopted  the  fee  schedule  to  ease  the 

financial  burden  posed  by  its  representation  of  non-members  such  as  Mr. 

Taylor in  future employment grievances.   This  is  precisely the arrangement 

described by the United States Supreme Court as a permissible alternative to 

compulsory agency fees.  See Janus, supra at 2468 n.6.  In the absence of 

the CBA, it is not apparent from the record if, or how, the fee schedule will 

otherwise  negatively  impact  Mr.  Taylor’s  rights  with  respect  to  his 

____________________________________________ 

6  As an example of such an alternative arrangement, the Supreme Court cited 
an Illinois statute providing that individuals who declined to pay agency fees 
on religious grounds could be charged a “reasonable cost” by the union if they 
later  sought  to  avail  themselves  of  union  representation  in  a  “grievance  or 
arbitration procedure[.]”  Janus, supra at 2468 n.6 (citing 5 ILCS 315/6(g)).

representation by PSCOA.  Furthermore, Mr. Taylor has offered no allegations 

that  the  fees  imposed  by  PSCOA  are  excessive  or  unrelated  to  prospective 

grievance  and  arbitration  proceedings.    The  mere  fact  that  PSCOA  has 

implemented the fee schedule is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish a 

violation of the duty of fair representation.  Without additional material facts 

to  support  his  conclusory  averments,  we  cannot  find  that  Mr.  Taylor  has 

asserted  a  sufficient  basis  to  establish  that  PSCOA  has  acted  arbitrarily, 

irrationally, or fraudulently.  See Anderson, supra at 6. 

Based  upon  the  foregoing  discussion,  we  agree  with  the  trial  court’s 

assessment that Mr. Taylor is not entitled to recovery as a matter of law.
