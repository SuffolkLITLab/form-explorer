      <pre>	1	IN THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA  WESTERN DISTRICT     ) IN RE: AMENDED  ) FIFTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT ) No.  23 WM 2020 EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ) PLAN  )   )      ORDER OF COURT   AND NOW, this 28th day of May, 2020, having previously declared a judicial emergency in the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, this Court amends its previous Emergency Operations Orders and now orders that the actions set forth below be taken pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. No. 1952(B)(2).  All provisions of this Order apply through August 31, 2020.   I. Public Access to Court Facilities • A Court Facility includes, but is not limited to: o The Civil Division located on the 7th and 8th floors of the City-County Building and the Housing Court Help Desk, located on the first floor of the City-County Building, 414 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219;  o The Criminal Division located on the 3rd and 5th floor of the Courthouse, 436 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219;  o The Family Law Center located at 440 Ross Street and 559 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15219;  o The Orphans’ Court Division, located on the 17th floor of the Frick Building, 437 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219;  o Pittsburgh Municipal Court, 660 First Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15219;  o All Magisterial District Courts located in Allegheny County; 	2	 o All Adult Probation Offices, located in Allegheny County;  o All Juvenile Probation Offices including the six Community Intensive Supervision Program sites located in Allegheny county;   o The Juvenile Dependency Hearing Officer Courtrooms located at:  1) (East Region) 10 Duff Road—Suite 208, 10 Corporate Center, Penn Hills, PA 15235;  2) (Mon Valley Region) 355 Lincoln Highway, North Versailles, PA 15137; 3) (North Region) 421 East Ohio Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15212; and  o Any Administrative Offices of the Fifth Judicial District.  • All court facilities, including the courtrooms in all Divisions of the Court of Common Pleas, the Magisterial District Courts and the City of Pittsburgh Municipal Court, will be open to the public for matters as specified below in this Order.  • Persons must wear masks to enter and remain in any court facility.  Persons who are not compliant with this order, will be required to leave the court facility.  • Persons who enter any court facility shall comply with CDC and Health Department recommendations for social distancing as well as any signage posted in or on court facilities or instructions from a judge, judicial officer, Sheriff’s deputy, police officer, constable, building security, or court employee.  • News media shall be permitted into court facilities but only in a manner that is consistent with public safety.  Cameras will not be allowed in any court facility, unless specifically authorized by the President Judge, Administrative Judge of a Division, or the District Court Administrator.  	3	• Sheriff’s deputies, police, constables, and building security assigned to any court facility are authorized to deny admission or remove a person who is visibly ill or who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.  Any person excluded or removed for health concerns shall be provided with information (telephone number or email address) to enable them to initiate, participate in, or complete necessary essential court business/functions during the judicial emergency.   • Only persons with essential court business are guaranteed admission into any court facility, subject to restrictions above. Friends and family members may be required to wait outside the facility.    • Sheriff’s deputies, police, constables, and building security shall have the authority to enforce all of the conditions in this section.  Persons who are not compliant with this order, will be required to leave the court facility.  II. Methods for Conducting Proceedings  • Whenever appropriate and feasible, and as directed by the President Judge, the Administrative Judges of the Divisions, and the District Court Administrator, court proceedings shall be conducted by Advanced Communication Technology (ACT), primarily through Microsoft Teams, pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings issued by the Court.  Other audio or teleconference methods may be employed, pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings issued by the Court, with the approval of the Administrative Judges.  See Protocol for Teleconference Hearings found on the Fifth Judicial District website.  • When it is determined that conducting court proceedings through ACT is not appropriate or feasible, court hearings and proceedings shall be 	4	conducted utilizing protocols and policies relating to the use of masks or other personal protective equipment, social distancing, and other guidance specified in Section II of this Order.  • Any administrative order, policy, or protocol issued by an Administrative Judge requiring certain proceedings to be conducted through ACT shall be followed.  Any exceptions to such an administrative order, policy, or protocol must be approved by the Administrative Judge of the Division.  • In order to prevent overcrowding, court appearances and hearing times shall be staggered, and the Administrative Judges may require that scheduling of cases be centralized in each division.  • Requests or Motions for Continuance should be liberally granted.  • Attorneys should encourage their clients to refrain from having non-participants accompany them to court proceedings.  • When a court reporter or other approved form of recording court proceedings is unavailable, alternative forms of recording shall be permitted.  • All persons participating in a court proceeding, including but not limited to, judges and judicial officers, attorneys, court employees, court reporters, witnesses, and spectators, are required to wear a mask for the entire proceeding.  The judge or judicial officer may permit a person to temporarily remove the mask to take testimony or where the presence of a mask would affect the ability to judge credibility, provided that the requirements for social distancing are followed.  	5	• Orders prohibiting and limiting the use of cellular phones in courtrooms and court facilities remain in effect.  However, due to the requirements for social distancing, an attorney may use a cellular telephone to communicate with a client or a witness while outside of the courtroom. An attorney may use a cellular telephone to confer with a client by text messaging during a court proceeding or matter in progress; to summon witnesses waiting in another location, to the courtroom; or for such other purpose deemed appropriate by the judge or judicial officer presiding over the court proceeding.    • The taking of photographs or the recording of any proceeding is strictly prohibited.  Anyone violating this provision shall forfeit their cellular phone or device and shall be subject to contempt proceedings or other sanctions.  • Taking the testimony of witnesses through ACT is strongly encouraged.  However, when a witness must testify in person in a courtroom, the witness may be required to wait in another location until such time as the court is prepared to take the testimony of the witness.  Upon conclusion of the testimony, the witness shall be excused from the courtroom and shall leave the court facility unless the judge or judicial officer determines that there is a reason that the witness must remain in the court facility.    • News media may be permitted into a courtroom, if social distancing can be maintained.  The court may designate certain seats for the news media, however, seats for attorneys, parties to the proceedings and essential court staff take priority over seats for the news media.  • Sidebar conferences are prohibited until further order of court.   	6	III. Time Calculations and Deadlines   • Except as otherwise set forth in this Order, the suspension of time calculations due to the judicial emergency that began on March 16, 2020 ends at the end of the day on June 1, 2020.  • Time calculations and deadlines were suspended during the judicial emergency so that they did not continue to run during that time. The suspension began on March 16, 2020 and continued through June 1, 2020–or for 78 days.  New deadlines shall be calculated by adding the time period of the suspension (days during which time calculations were suspended due to the judicial emergency as applied to the particular time calculation) to the original deadline. The period of suspension caused by the judicial emergency added on to the deadline shall only include that period of the suspension during which the particular time calculation would have otherwise been running.    • For example, if an original 30-day deadline fell on March 19, 2020, and the period of suspension under the judicial emergency was 78 days (March 16th through June 1st), the new deadline would be June 5, 2020 (78 days after March 19th).  In this example, the particular time calculation stopped running during the entire 78-day suspension when it would have otherwise been running. If, however, a deadline expired before the judicial emergency began, then that deadline would not be extended by the judicial emergency.     • The period of suspension caused by the judicial emergency added on to the deadline shall only include that period of the suspension during which the particular time calculation would have otherwise been running.  For example, if a 20-day time period begins running on May 27, 2020, when a complaint is served, then the original 20-day deadline 	7	would be June 16, 2020. The period during which this particular time calculation would be suspended by the judicial emergency would be 6 days (from May 27th through June 1st) and the new deadline would be June 22, 2020 (6 days after June 16, 2020).  Stated differently, if a 20-day time period begins running on May 27, 2020, when a complaint is served upon the defendant, the parties start counting the 20-day time period from June 2, 2020, (i.e. June 3rd is day one), and the new deadline is again June 22, 2020.  • If, however, the particular time calculation does not start to run until after June 1, 2020, then the deadline would not be extended as it would be unaffected by the suspension.  For example, if a 20-day time period begins running on June 3, 2020 when a complaint is served then the original 20-day deadline of June 23, 2020 would not be extended.   • Postponements or continuances resulting from the judicial emergency shall be considered court postponements and shall constitute excludable time, subject to constitutional limitations for purposes of the application of Rule 600.  See Commonwealth v. Bradford, 46 A.3d 693 (Pa. 2012) and Commonwealth v. Mills, 162 A. 3d 323 (Pa. 2017).    • The suspension of Rule 600, subject to constitutional limitations, as indicated in this Court’s previous Emergency Operations Orders, began on March 16, 2020 and will continue through August 31, 2020, subject to further order of court.    • Jury trials in both the Civil and Criminal Divisions remain suspended until further Order of Court.    • Attorneys and litigants shall not use the judicial emergency to secure strategic advantage in litigation, including by dilatory conduct.  	8	Individual judges may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a failure to meet a deadline was not directly the result of or affected by the judicial emergency, (such as in routine discovery matters) and whether the deadline should have been met during the judicial emergency.  The judge may then take any action deemed appropriate to address the situation.  IV. Transportation, Signatures, Fingerprinting, and Publication  • There will be no identification process at time of arrest, unless processed through the Allegheny County Jail. Defendants will be assigned a fingerprint appointment for a later date.  • Until further Order of Court:  o No inmates will be transported from the Allegheny County Jail or a state correctional facility for preliminary hearings. o Juveniles will not be transported from Shuman Detention Center or Hartman Shelter for court hearings o Where the participation of the inmate or juvenile is required at a court hearing, Advanced Communication Technology shall be considered before issuing the order to transport. o All juveniles or inmates who are being transported shall wear a mask.  o The Sheriff’s deputies may refuse to transport an inmate or juvenile who is visibly ill, who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or who refuses to wear a mask, and shall immediately notify the assigned judge.  • Alternative methods of signing, delivery, and service of court documents and orders shall be permitted.  This includes, but is not limited to, 	9	facsimile signatures, electronic signatures, proxy signatures, and designated court employees authorized to sign on behalf of a judge after the judge has reviewed and approved the document for signature.  Pro se litigants completing forms at Pittsburgh Municipal Court may authorize court employees to sign documents, when necessary, for the safety of the litigants and court employees. Under such circumstances, the court employee will sign his/her name to the document indicating that the litigant has reviewed the document and that all of the information contained therein was provided by the litigant.  If an employee must sign for a pro se litigant, he/she will do so in a manner allowing the litigant to see the employee sign the document.      • In the interest of public health, the Pittsburgh Legal Journal shall be published as an electronic PDF through the duration of the judicial emergency in the Fifth Judicial District.  During the judicial emergency, proofs of publication produced by the Pittsburgh Legal Journal can be properly verified and signed by a notary public only, instead of a notary public and an affiant as is typically required.  Proofs of publication may be mailed or emailed to relevant parties. Records of all electronic proofs of publication and email correspondence shall be preserved.   V. Civil Division  • Where appropriate and feasible, Civil Division proceedings shall be conducted by Advanced Communication Technology, primarily through Microsoft Teams, pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings issued by the Court.  Other audio or teleconference methods may be employed, pursuant to the protocol for teleconference hearings issued by the Court, with the approval of the Administrative Judges.  See 	10	Protocol for Teleconference Hearings posted on the Fifth Judicial District website.  • Non-jury trials shall commence beginning in June 2020.  Where appropriate and possible, such non-jury trials shall be conducted using Advanced Communication Technology (ACT).  When it is not appropriate and possible to use ACT for non-jury trials, all parties, lawyers, witnesses, and persons participating in the trial must follow the Fifth Judicial District’s protocols and policies relating to the use of masks or other personal protective equipment, social distancing, and other guidance specified in Section II of this Order.  • Consistent with this Order, the following matters shall be conducted remotely through the use of Advanced Communication Technology:   (1) Calendar Control Motions,  (2) Housing Court Motions. (3) Discovery Motions, (4) General Motions (contested and uncontested),  (5) Oral arguments on Preliminary Objections,  (6) Oral arguments on Motions for Summary Judgment, or Judgment on the Pleadings, (7) Conciliations relating to cases on the May 2020 Trial List, and (8) All other matters scheduled by any individual judge relating to a case specifically assigned to that judge, unless litigants lack the ability to participate using Advanced Communication Technology and under such circumstances, the individual Judge will utilize appropriate methods to adjudicate and/or conduct arguments/hearings utilizing protocols and policies relating to the 	11	use of masks or other personal protective equipment, social distancing, and other guidance specified in Section II of this Order.  • See the Fifth Judicial District website, www.alleghenycourts.us, for procedures and instructions relating to the following matters, including Operating Procedures for all judges and remote submissions of the following:  (1) Calendar Control Motions; (2) Discovery Motions; (3) General Motions; (4) Preliminary Objections; and (5) Motions for Summary Judgment/Judgment on the Pleadings.  • Notwithstanding the suspension of time calculations and deadlines set forth in Section I above, individual judges are hereby invested with substantial discretion with the enforcement of time deadlines which he/she has established in a particular case when handling one of the matters outlined above in items (1) through (8) of the Civil Division section of this Order.   • All prior Fifth Judicial District Court Orders regarding the suspension of evictions and related proceedings due to the judicial emergency shall expire at the end of the day on June 1, 2020.   The Governor’s Orders of May 7, and May 22, 2020, prohibiting commencement of actions filed under the Landlord Tenant Act of 1951 for failure to pay rent, or due to an expired lease remain in effect.   Landlord tenant actions filed prior to March 16, 2020, may proceed pursuant to applicable rules and laws.  	12	• Arbitration hearings will resume in June of 2020 utilizing the protocols and policies relating to the use of masks or other personal protective equipment, social distancing, and other guidance specified in Section II of this Order. However, where all parties agree to using Advanced Communication Technology (ACT), or by Order of Court upon cause shown by one or more parties, arbitration hearings may be conducted remotely through use of ACT.    • Conciliations and hearings before the Board of Viewers shall be conducted remotely where appropriate and possible using ACT.  Where the litigants are unable to participate remotely utilizing ACT, the Board of Viewers may proceed with in-person hearings, as necessary, utilizing protocols and policies relating to the use of masks or other personal protective equipment, social distancing, and other guidance specified in Section II of this Order.  • In any case specially assigned to a judge, the judge assigned shall attempt to utilize Advanced Communication Technology for all hearings, conferences, and/or oral arguments on such matters so assigned. Where one or more parties is unable to participate using Advanced Communication Technologies, then under such circumstances, the assigned judge may conduct in-person hearings, conferences, and/or oral arguments utilizing protocols and policies relating to the use of masks or other personal protective equipment, social distancing, and other guidance specified in Section II of this Order.   • The Commerce and Complex Litigation Center will hear all petitions, motions, conciliations, and hearings remotely using Advanced Communications Technology; see the standardized operating procedures for  Administrative Judge Christine A. Ward, and Judge Philip 	13	Ignelzi, available on the Fifth Judicial District website, www.alleghenycourts.us for information concerning  matters assigned to the Commerce and Complex Litigation Center.
