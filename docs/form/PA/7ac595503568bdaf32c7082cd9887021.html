Guardianship 
Tracking

After careful research, design 

and development, Pennsylvania’s 

much-anticipated Guardianship 

Tracking System (GTS) is now live 

in almost every county. 

(continued on page 2)

With the new Guardianship 
Tracking System, everyone wins

After careful research, design and development, Pennsylvania’s much-anticipated 
Guardianship Tracking System (GTS) is now live in almost every county. 

Developed by AOPC/IT 
and the Office of Elder 
Justice in the Courts 
under the direction 
and supervision of the 
Advisory Council on 
Elder Justice in the Courts, the GTS 
is a new web-based system in which 
guardians of adults of all ages, court 
staff, Orphans’ Court clerks and judges 
can file, manage, track and submit 
guardianship reports. 

The new system is designed with the 
goal of monitoring guardian activity 
in Pennsylvania while streamlining 
and improving the guardianship filing 
process. 

“Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the 
nation for the highest population 
percentage of elders,” said 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice 
Debra Todd. “As the commonwealth’s 
aging population continues to grow, 
it is increasingly important to ensure 
the protection of some of our most 
vulnerable citizens.” 

Court-appointed guardians of 
incapacitated adults can now receive 
automatic reminders about important 
filing dates and deadlines. They can 
file inventory forms and annual reports 
online rather than having to go to 
their county courthouse to file reports 
manually.

Historically, court staff in each county 
have been tasked with manually 
scanning and filing guardians’ 
inventories and annual reports. 
However, the Elder Law Taskforce 
noted in its final report to the Supreme 
Court that the majority of Orphans’ 
Court clerks reported that they do not 
monitor whether inventory and annual 
reports are submitted by guardians. 

The GTS will ease the burden of the 
guardianship filing process for these 
court staff while ensuring that every 
report is automatically reviewed.

Far too often people who are 
financially exploited do not realize 
what has happened to them for 

months, sometimes years. Among its 
many benefits, the GTS will ensure that 
potential guardianship problems are 
identified and responded to quickly. 

Additionally, the GTS integrates 
guardian information into a statewide 
database rather than separate, 
individual county databases. 

“This statewide collection of data will 
not only eliminate the potential for 
an unsuitable guardian to relocate to 
other counties, but will also generate 
information about guardianship trends 
that will help decision makers draft 
laws and establish procedures to 
better protect Pennsylvanians,” said 
Amy Whitworth, AOPC/IT analyst 
manager.

Everyone involved in the development 
and implementation of the GTS should 
be very proud knowing that their 
long-dedicated efforts have effected 
real change in the way Pennsylvania 
protects its most vulnerable citizens.

Harassment 
training 
conducted 
online

Earlier this year, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court approved mandatory 
harassment prevention training for all AOPC, appellate court and state-level 
district court staff. 

Participants were introduced to concepts and received practical guidance 
on how to identify the various types of harassment and recognize 
behaviors that may be considered inappropriate through videos inspired by 
real-life harassment cases. 

The course also introduced staff to harassment prevention guidelines 
through scenario building and outlining of both organizational and personal 
liabilities arising from any such transgressions. A manager’s version of the 
training extended the employee version with discussion regarding the 
pitfalls and risks for failing to stop known harassment. 

Designed to engage participants and validate comprehension, a short 
quiz concluded the program and directed staff to policies and procedures 
including specific reporting instructions. 

While harassment prevention training is currently not required for all 
employers in Pennsylvania, this training reinforced our long-standing 
dedication to fair and equal treatment to all who work in or enter the 
commonwealth’s courts and related offices. 

The Supreme Court is committed to promoting equal employment 
opportunity and non-discriminatory practices and this comprehensive 
training ensured that message was sent to staff. 

Cumberland County pilots text 
notification program

In an attempt to reduce the number of 
people who fail to appear at scheduled 
court dates, Cumberland County 
is piloting a mandatory electronic 
notification system that requires 
people to sign up for text or email 
alerts about upcoming court hearings.

District Court Administrator for 
Cumberland County, Melissa Calvanelli, 
explained that the county initially rolled 
out the system in the fall of 2017 on 
a volunteer basis, but only saw about 
100 people sign up to participate over 
the six-month trial period. 

Beginning this past July, the system 
was rolled out again, but this time 
participation from everyone in the 
court system was mandatory. 

Alerts are sent out seven days prior to 
the scheduled court date and again 
one day before.

“The first notification gives people 
a heads-up to make arrangements 
to find a babysitter, take off work or 
whatever they need to do to be able to 
attend,” said Calvanelli. “The second 
notification is a last-minute reminder 
so people really can no longer use ‘I 

forgot’ as a valid excuse in front of a 
judge.” 

The notification program technology 
was developed by the County 
Commissioners Association of 
Pennsylvania as a pilot for Cumberland 
County.

i d e   t o   p o w e r   o f f

s l

“Other counties have shown a lot of 
interest in the program and are waiting 
to see our results,” said Calvanelli. 

According to Calvanelli, since the 
county rolled out the program on a 
mandatory basis in July, there has 
been a slight downtick in the number 
of people who miss their scheduled 
hearings. 

However, the first month was mainly 
spent entering data into the system 
and getting people set-up to receive 
alerts, so they plan to re-evaluate 
the program’s results after about six 
months, where they hope to see a 
more significant decline in that number.

Calvanelli explained that court 
hearings are usually scheduled 
months in advance and often times 
when someone doesn’t show up, it’s 
because they either forgot or got the 
date wrong.

Even if a defendant’s court absence 
is an innocent mistake, a failure-to-
appear warrant must be issued. This 
ends up costing taxpayers thousands 
of dollars every year in additional staff 
time, paperwork and possibly jail time 
for the defendant. 

If the program reduces the number 
of failure-to-appear warrants by just 
six percent, it will end up paying for 
itself. Counties in other states including 
Oregon and Washington have 
implemented similar programs and saw 
reductions in missed court dates by 30 
to 50 percent. 

If it’s deemed a success in Cumberland 
County and other counties decide to 
implement similar programs, it could 
end up reducing administrative court 
costs statewide. 

Lottery prizes now subject to intercept by Revenue

A new law took effect in October 
requiring the Pennsylvania Lottery to 
check with the Administrative Office 
of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) for any 
outstanding court judgments before 
awarding any winnings over $2,500. 

If court-ordered obligations are found 
to exist, the AOPC must report the total 
amount owed to the Department of 
Revenue, which will be deducted from 
the prize amount and used to satisfy 
those obligations. 

Additionally, the new law requires that 
the Lottery check for any outstanding 
tax obligations with the Department of 
Revenue as well. 

All Pennsylvania Lottery winnings 
over $2,500 were already subject to 
intercept by the Department of Human 
Services for child support obligations, 
but the new law adds Revenue and 
AOPC to that process.

For any outstanding obligation that 
exists for either back taxes or court 
judgments, a $15 administrative 
fee will be deducted from the final 
winnings that will go into the Lottery 
Fund supporting benefits for older 
Pennsylvanians. 

If obligations exceeding the prize 
amount are found to exist with any of 
these three departments, the claimant

will not be eligible to receive any of the 
winnings. 

For Lottery winnings over $5,000, 
applicable income taxes will be 
withheld before any outstanding 
obligations are intercepted.

Staff and community respond during 
Fayette County district court incident 

“I’m very thankful 

and proud of the 

bravery displayed by 

my staff during this 

tragic event,” said 

Judge Shimshock. 

“They were a huge 

part of ensuring that 

a terrible situation 

was not as bad as 

it could have been 

without them.”

On Sep. 19, 2018, at the office of 
Fayette County Magisterial District 
Judge Daniel Shimshock in Masontown, 
a gunman opened fire in a waiting room 
full of court users and court staff.  

Office manager, Becky Rider, while 
praying, attended to the wounded 
wife who had been shot in the arm. 
The shooter was fatally wounded by a 
German Township police officer.  

The assailant was identified as the 
defendant in a domestic abuse criminal 
action scheduled for preliminary 
hearing that afternoon. The defendant 
shot his estranged wife, two other men 
and a police officer who attempted to 
prevent him from continuing.

“I’m very thankful and proud of 
the bravery displayed by my staff 
during this tragic event,” said Judge 
Shimshock. “They were a huge part 
of ensuring that a terrible situation 
was not as bad as it could have been 
without them.”  

Court staff and the public heard 
the shots and took cover in Judge 
Shimshock’s office and in the staff’s 
restroom.   

Ashley Mansberry and Melanie Jesko, 
secretarial staff, bravely took the 
young daughter of a police officer, 
who was shadowing her dad that 
day, and a mother and infant into the 
restroom for cover.  

The magisterial district court staff were 
commended for their fast thinking 
and selflessness and were presented 
certificates of appreciation by 
President Judge John F. Wagner, Jr.   

“I’m grateful for the response from the 
criminal justice community during this 
traumatic situation,” added President 
Judge Wagner.

Pennsylvania courts launch outreach 
campaign to help stop abuse

In October, the Pennsylvania courts launched an 
educational outreach campaign using social media ads 
and bilingual video production to educate victims of 
abuse on how the courts can help them. 

Funded by federal STOP Grant money, AOPC created and 
launched digital ads on Facebook, Instagram and Google. 
The online ads work to make victims increasingly aware 
that protection orders exist as an option to help stop their 
abuse. 

When clicked on, the ads direct users to a detailed step-
by-step video explaining the process of how to file for 
a protection order in Pennsylvania – a process that the 
courts recognize can be overwhelming and scary for 
victims to navigate alone. 

Produced by AOPC/Communications, the Pennsylvania 
Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the 
Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, the video aims to 
make victims feel comfortable navigating the court system 
when filing for a protection order and prepares them for 
exactly what to expect at each step of the process. 

The video is available in both English and Spanish on a 
new webpage on pacourts.us/learn that houses a variety 
of helpful protection order resources.

Through an expanded online and social media presence, 
the courts can reach a significant audience that they might 
not have previously been able to engage.

“The public’s access to courts is a fundamental right but 
that right is only fulfilled when people know how the 
judicial system works,” said Tom Darr, court administrator 
of Pennsylvania. 

This campaign marks an exciting step in the courts’ efforts 
to reach a specific audience immediately and directly using 
social media. It opens the door a lot wider when it comes 
to how the courts communicate important information 
about the resources we can provide to the public.” 

Many victims of abuse either are not aware that protection 
orders exist as an option to help end their abuse, or they 
are intimidated by the process. By educating the public, 
the courts hope that victims of abuse gain the knowledge 
and confidence to seek the help they need.

Court security: 
Assessing threats, 
avoiding tragedies 

Since the inception of Pennsylvania’s Judicial Incident 
Reporting System (PAJIRS) in Magisterial District Courts in 
2005 and Common Pleas Courts in 2007, staff in the AOPC/ 
Office of Judicial District Security (OJDS) have assessed and 
responded to over 4,700 security incidents. 

PAJIRS provides judges, court administrators and other 
designated users with an electronic format in which to 
capture threats to court safety and security. For staff in the 
OJDS, it provides a dynamic tool that serves many purposes. 

First and foremost, it enables these OJDS staff members 
to connect quickly with courts to provide guidance on any 
needed protective measures for judges and court staff. 
It also allows them to liaise with law enforcement when 
necessary, and recommend short-term and long-term 
countermeasures that may be warranted. 

In addition to OJDS staff, the district court administrator and 
sheriff both receive an immediate email notification that an 
incident report has been filed in their county. 

Accordingly, these two key local court security members 
have instant access to information related to the incident, 
allowing them to follow through on guidance provided by 
OJDS staff and discuss the incident with other members of 
their local court security committee established pursuant to 
Pa. R. JA. No. 1954.

Subsequently, they are able to offer recommendations to 
the president judge regarding policies and procedures to 
mitigate risks associated with the instant and future threats. 

PAJIRS is emblematic of the vital communication efforts 
designed to keep judges, court staff and other building 
occupants and visitors in court facilities safe. 

Of the incidents reported via PAJIRS, those that arise out 
of domestic relations cases are especially concerning to 
OJDS staff. Decisions regarding divorce, child custody and 
financial support can serve as overwhelming stressors for 
the involved parties. 

Regardless if a physical altercation occurs at a proceeding 
or not, the communication of any type of threat, whether 
directed towards others or implied, merits attention. There is 
no “over-reporting” of such threats.

Developing and maintaining a robust security posture for 
court facilities necessitates consistent collaboration and 
communication among stakeholders at the local level.  
Through PAJIRS, these stakeholders have a formal method 
by which to communicate threats and implement strategies 
to avert tragedies.  

Changing with the times 

Court security is a national concern 
that is expanding in scope. This past 
July, the 2018 Annual Conference 
of State Court Administrators and 
Conference of Chief Justices’ was 
devoted to security topics that went 
beyond people and facilities.

Cyber threats are growing as rapidly 
as technology, pressing court 
security professionals and judicial 
leaders to expand their definition of

Domestic Relations 
Rule Change 

By Bruce J. Ferguson  
Counsel to the Domestic Relations 
Procedural Rules Committee

In August, the Supreme Court 
of Pennsylvania adopted rules 
implementing parenting coordination, 
which become effective March 1, 2019. 

Parenting coordination is a non-
confrontational, conflict-resolution 
process for parents who have ongoing 
high conflict or extensive custody-
related litigation. The underlying 
principles of parenting coordination 
focus on providing for a child’s best 
interest and facilitating parents’ 
decision-making.  

The process helps parents implement 
and comply with final custody orders, 
reduces conflict between parents and 
minimizes custody-related litigation.

The Court adopted a procedural 
framework for parenting coordination 
similar to that of the rules governing 
the processes that child custody and 
juvenile dependency hearing officers 
must follow – processes that also 
incorporate a mediation concept to 
assist parties in resolving their issues.  

Parenting coordinators meet with 
parties to discuss their issues and 
possible resolutions. If the parties 
are unable to agree, the parenting 

coordinator provides his or her 
recommended resolution to the court. 
In the event a party disagrees with 
the recommendation of the parenting 
coordinator, the rules provide for a new 
hearing before a judge.

Most importantly, the rules outline 
the judiciary’s role in the parenting 
coordination process – the appointing 
judge is responsible for supervising the 
parenting coordinator and reviewing 
each of their recommendations. 

For judicial districts implementing 
a parenting coordination program, 
the rules require that the local 
court maintain a list of qualified 
parenting coordinators – these can 
include attorneys or mental health 
professionals who meet the rule’s 
qualifications and have submitted 
an affidavit to the president judge or 
administrative judge.  

Additionally, the rules require that 
a judicial district implementing a 
parenting coordination program 
establish a local rule allowing low-
income parties to participate in the 
program either for free or at a reduced 
fee.

The judicial district is also required to 
establish a local rule establishing the 
hourly rate that a parenting coordinator 
may charge the parties.

In addition to the parenting 
coordination rules, the Domestic 
Relations Procedural Rules Committee 
recommended amendments to 
the Rules of Civil of Procedure that 
eliminate the charging of fees that are 
not specifically authorized by statute in 
all domestic relations actions, as well 
as establish a statewide uniformity for 
the filing of support-related pleadings 
and documents.

The amendments require that all 
support-related pleadings and 
documents be filed in a single filing 
office in each county’s domestic 
relations section. Additionally, the 
amendments now prevent parties 
with child support, spousal support 
and alimony claims from filing them as 
counts in a divorce complaint, requiring 
that they be filed in the domestic 
relations section as well. 

These amendments were adopted 
by the Supreme Court and become 
effective Jan. 1, 2019.

Veterans belong in our 
hearts, not in our prisons 

“I went from being in a war 
zone to being back home  
in North Carolina within  
72 hours,” said former  
U.S. Marine Sergeant  
Tim Wynn.

“Four days after returning 
home, I was arrested for 
aggravated assault.”

One of the three Veterans Courts 
events presented this fall by AOPC’s 
Problem-Solving Court unit included 
a half-day session at Widener Law 
School, where former U.S. Marine Sgt. 
Tim Wynn shared how his experience 
with Pennsylvania’s Veterans Court 
gave him his life back.

Wynn served from 1999 to 2003 and 
was stationed in Iraq following 9/11 
when he was honorably discharged 
and sent back home. 

“I went from being in a war zone to 
being back home in North Carolina 
within 72 hours,” said Wynn. “Four days 
after returning home, I was arrested for 
aggravated assault.” 

Unable to process this abrupt 
transition, Wynn began to abuse drugs 
and alcohol as a way to cope with his 
posttraumatic stress disorder and other 
mental issues that stemmed from his 
time in the war.

After serving a brief sentence in a 
Philadelphia county prison, Wynn was 
arrested an eighth time. This is when 
he found himself in Veterans Court 
where he was given the opportunity to 
turn his life around. 

Within eight months, Wynn had 
graduated from the program and 
dedicated his life to helping other 

veterans. He is now a Veterans 
Certified Peer Specialist and leader 
of the Philadelphia Veterans Court 
Mentor Program.

“I had no mission when I returned 
home from war,” said Wynn. “Veterans 
Court put a mission back in my life, and 
I’m now an employee at the court that I 
was once a defendant in many times.”

Wynn was able to get 17 charges 
expunged from his record, but of all 
the things Veterans Court allowed 
him to get back, Wynn said the most 
important to him was the ability to be a 
part of his family and be a good father 
to his two young children. 

There are currently Veterans Courts 
in 20 Pennsylvania counties that see 
a 73 percent successful graduation 
rate. The purpose of these treatment 
courts is to reduce recidivism and 
help veterans return to their jobs 
and families and become productive 
citizens – the effects of which Sgt. Tim 
Wynn can personally attest to. 

Other keynote speakers for the 
event included the director of the 
National Association of Drug Court 
Professionals’ (NADCP) new Advancing 
Justice initiative, Melissa Fitzgerald, 
and her father, former Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court Justice James 
Fitzgerald, who both spoke about the 
crucial need for Veterans Courts in our 
society. 

“I firmly believe that Veterans Courts 
work,” said Justice Fitzgerald. 
“Veterans Courts, mental health 
courts, and all other problem-solving 
courts play a vital role in ensuring our 
courts and criminal justice system truly 
provides justice to all.” 

Justice Fitzgerald spoke about the 
negative effect that harsh, mandatory 
sentences have had on the country 
as a whole. He explained that 
incarceration costs the taxpayers 

above: former United States Marine Sgt. Tim Wynn

James Fitzgerald

roughly $36,000 per prisoner, per 
year, and that anywhere from 20 to 40 
percent of those incarcerated suffer 
from mental health issues. 

“Ironically, America, home of the free, 
has the highest incarceration rate 
of any other country,” said Justice 
Fitzgerald. “We can’t incarcerate our 
way out of crime and criminal activity.”

Other panel members for the event 
included Veterans Affairs professionals, 
as well as Veterans Court mentors and 
judges including Philadelphia County 
Judge Patrick Dugan, a former captain 
in the United States Army reserve who 
oversaw Wynn’s journey through the 
program. 

“Veterans Courts exemplify all that we 
owe to our veterans for their sacrifices 
for this country,” Justice Fitzgerald 
concluded. “We must make room 
for veterans in our hearts, not in our 
prisons.”

Legislative roundup

by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

The legislature ended its final scheduled day of voting for the 2017-18 legislative session 
on October 17, sending over 90 bills to the governor for his consideration. Many of 
the bills impact the courts in some fashion, such as programming changes to case 
management systems and the implementation of rule and/or form changes. 

Domestic Violence (DV) – The governor signed 
HB 2060 as Act 79. Authored by Rep. Marguerite 
Quinn, the legislation adds language to the 
current Uniform Firearms Act (UFA) and Protection 
from Abuse (PFA) Law, specifically regarding 
relinquishment of firearms in DV cases. 

Under the UFA, individuals convicted of 
misdemeanor crimes of DV must relinquish 
firearms and firearm licenses to law enforcement 
within 24 hours of the conviction. Under the 
PFA Law, all final PFA orders not resulting from 
consent agreements must prohibit defendants from 
possessing firearms during the term of the order 
and require defendants to relinquish firearms and 
firearm licenses. For final PFA orders based on 
consent agreements, courts may order defendants 
to relinquish firearms. Relinquishment must occur 
within 24 hours. 

Other DV legislation enacted provides for 
sentencing enhancements for DV crimes witnessed 
by minors who are family or household members 
(Act 157); requires plaintiffs with knowledge of 
founded or indicated reports of child abuse 
involving defendants to include such information 
in the PFA petition (Act 92); prohibits parties 
convicted of committing personal injury crimes 
against the other party from receiving spousal 
support or alimony pendente lite (Act 102). 

Use of audio/video devices in court – A bill authored by Rep. 
Jerry Knowles and signed by the governor as Act 94 amends 
the Crimes Code to prohibit the operation of devices to capture, 
record, transmit or broadcast a photograph, video, motion picture 
or audio of proceedings or persons within a judicial facility, 
without the approval of the court or as provided by rules of 
court. Judicial facility is defined as courtrooms, hearing rooms 
or judicial chambers, as well as other rooms made available to 
interview witnesses. Rule of Judicial Administration 1910 indicates 
judges should prohibit broadcasting in courtrooms and adjacent 
areas, but the rule allows for exceptions. 

Other legislation of note signed by the governor:

•  Allowing incumbent magisterial district judges to file 

certificates of nomination for reelection – specifying the intent 
to seek reelection – in lieu of filing nominating petitions (Act 
127)

•  Providing for automated speed enforcement systems (i.e., 
cameras) in active works zones on highways under the 
jurisdiction of PennDOT and the Turnpike Commission and a 
portion of U.S. Route 1 in Philadelphia (Act 86)

•  Adding a new chapter to the Crimes Code to focus on hazing, 

primarily on college campuses (Act 80).

The Hollenbach’s helping 
hands and hearts 

Longtime AOPC employees Bill and Sue Hollenbach share many things 
– a home, an employer and a love for animals so strong that it inspires 
a call to service for many people who hear about their work. 

On top of busy work schedules and hosting international exchange 
students, the couple runs an animal rescue shelter from their home in 
Mechanicsburg called The Homeward Bound Animal Rescue. 

Soon after forming the rescue in 2006, they discovered an unsettling 
truth about the fate of pregnant dogs – they are almost always 
euthanized because they are deemed unadoptable by shelters. This 
knowledge shifted the rescue’s mission to primarily taking in pregnant 
dogs or dogs who have just delivered their puppies. 

While equipped with birthing sites in their basement to deliver the 
puppies, Sue explained that often times during delivery they end up 
having to call the vet. 

“A good number of our moms require C-sections because there is no 
control over them breeding with a much larger dog. They often can’t 
pass the puppies naturally and we end up doing emergency C-sections 
to save the mothers’ lives,” Sue said. 

After delivering the puppies, they raise them to a certain age before 
sending them to one of their 20 foster homes. The mommy dogs are 
kept with the puppies for at least three months until the Hollenbachs 
are confident about the type of home they would fit best in.

Sue explained that their rescue has evolved over the years to focus 
on the type of rescue work that they feel compelled to do – whether 
that’s paying the electric bill for another local animal shelter, buying 
horses that would’ve otherwise been sent to a glue factory or paying 
to transport donations to their partner rescue in Kentucky and its 
surrounding communities.

Most of the dogs come from their partner rescue in Kentucky where 
they help fund a program that gives Christmas meals and gifts to 
impoverished children in the community. Sue said that the presents are 
said to be from a shelter dog, and attached to the gift is the dog’s story. 

“If you can turn the mindset around on these kids at a young age, they 
will hopefully look at animals in a much more humane way and learn 
not to abuse them,” Sue said.

Sue and Bill are able to do all of this with the money that their rescue 
takes in from puppy adoption fees. Without those fees, they would not 
be able to fund the care and treatment for their mommy dogs, or the 
many other expenses they incur. 

Since their rescue was formed, the Hollenbachs have seen the 
adoption of over 4,300 lucky dogs – dogs who likely faced a very 
different outcome. 

“It all started with one litter of puppies,” Bill said. “After that it didn’t take 
long for Sue to discover that this was her passion. 12 years later, Sue is 
Homeward Bound – and I’m happy to help support her dreams.”

Judicial Conduct Board 
Chief Counsel Retires

The Honorable Robert Graci is retiring after serving six years 
as chief counsel to the Judicial Conduct Board (JCB). 

Looking back, Graci said he is grateful for his varied career, 
having earned marvelous opportunities and experiences 
that he never imagined he would have – like arguing a 
case in the U.S. Supreme Court, serving the Pennsylvania 
attorney general and running a department within state 
government.

Among the many other notable roles he assumed over the 
last four decades, Graci served as deputy attorney general 
for almost 18 years before being appointed to the Superior 
Court in 2002. 

After serving on the Superior Court, Graci worked in private 
practice where he headed the firm’s Appellate Practice 
Group for a short period before eagerly returning to state 
government to serve as chief counsel for the JCB.

“I’ve had the privilege of working for a great board and 
a wonderful staff,” Graci said. “I’ve experienced a lot of 
interesting things and a lot of difficult things, but all of 
it was important to the board and to the people of the 
commonwealth, and I am happy to have been a part of it.”

Honorable Robert Graci 

Upon retirement, Graci said he looks forward to spending 
more time with his wife, children and grandchildren. 

While he has no specific plans, Graci said that he likes 
being a lawyer and expects that he will be engaged with 
something related to law.
