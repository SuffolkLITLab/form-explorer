Engaging families 
to combat truancy

Pennsylvania schools and magisterial district courts 
focus on improving school attendance.

Magisterial district courts:  
Engaging families to combat truancy 

60-90 days, and if there are no further 
problems, I’ll dismiss the case,” he said. 

 “We’re not just judges. 
In some of these cases, 
we’re social workers . . . 
and counselors to these 
students.”  
– Judge David Judy

He said that more often than not in 
truancy cases, there are deeper family 
problems that explain the root of the 
student’s attendance issues, and his 
goal is to help solve those problems 
rather than just fine the student or 
parent.  

 “We’re not just judges. In some of 
these cases, we’re social workers . . . 
and counselors to these students,”  
said Judge Judy.

Judge Corbett agreed that the majority 
of truancy cases are the result of an 
issue at home. She explained that a 

Research shows that roughly nine 
percent of Pennsylvania students are 
habitually truant with many of these 
truancy cases beginning in elementary 
and middle school, according to the 
Pennsylvania Department of Education. 

Following passage of a new truancy 
law in 2016, Pennsylvania schools and 
magisterial district courts continue to 
focus on improving school attendance 
using approaches that best help truant 
students by engaging their families 
to support attendance and preserve 
family unity.   

“With the new truancy 
law, truancy cases 
have become more 
manageable and we 
have seen a reduction in 
the number of truancy 
referrals to magisterial 
district courts.” 
– Judge Joanne Corbett

Magisterial District Judge Joanne P. 
Corbett, from Lackawanna County, said 
that often times attendance problems 
are adopted by younger siblings, and 
to prevent family truancy patterns, 
early intervention and discovering the 
root cause of truant behavior is critical. 

The 2016 truancy law requires schools 
and courts to use approaches that 
identify and address attendance issues 
as early as possible using credible 
interventions. Among some of the 
law’s most significant changes to how 
truancy cases are handled include:

• 

The creation of procedures 
(including mandatory family 
notifications and school 
attendance improvement 
conferences) that schools must 
follow when handling both truant 
and habitually truant students with 
court referral as the last resort 

• 

The restriction of truancy 
disciplinary actions that result 
in excluding students from the 
regular classroom 

•  Considerable discretion for 
magisterial district judges to 
impose appropriate penalties in 
individual cases.

Both Judge Corbett and Magisterial 
District Judge David H. Judy, from 
Dauphin County, were involved in 
discussions concerning the 2016 
truancy law during their time as 
members of the Pennsylvania State 
Roundtable’s Educational Success and 
Truancy Workgroup launched in 2009.  

The group was tasked with identifying 
the systemic issues in Pennsylvania 
relating to truancy and outlining an 
approach for how to combat these 
issues – part of which was the 
development of the new truancy law.

Judge Corbett said, “With the new 
truancy law, truancy cases have 
become more manageable and we 
have seen a reduction in the number of 
truancy referrals to magisterial district 
courts.”

Pennsylvania schools are 
now mandated to hold school 
attendance improvement 
conferences with the student 
and their family before any court 
referral, but Judge Judy explained 
that truancy cases will go to 
magisterial district courts when 
the student/parent(s) are absent or 
uncooperative. 

When explaining how he handles 
those truancy cases brought 
before him, Judge Judy said, “I 
try to stress the importance of 
education and getting a high 
school diploma and hopefully give 
the student and parents a wake-up 
call. 

“If I’m getting cooperation, I’ll put the 
case on hold and review it again in 

2

student’s attendance problems 
usually have a specific cause 
whether it’s a lack of reliable 
transportation, a need to work, an 
inability to afford school uniforms or 
a responsibility to care for younger 
siblings.

She went on to express appreciation 
for the Children and Youth Services 

(CYS) school liaisons in Lackawanna 
County who greatly assist the 
schools and courts in handling 
truancy cases early and effectively.  

The goal of any truancy case is to 
deter further attendance issues, 
address the root cause of the 
problem and ultimately help the 
student get on the right track. 

Interpreter Certification 
Program continually engaged 
in recruitment and outreach 
By Osvaldo R. Avilés,  
Interpreter Certification Program administrator

Since its inception, AOPC’s 
Interpreter Certification Program 
(ICP) has continually strived to recruit 
qualified candidates in all languages 
for the interpreter roster to help the 
judiciary provide access to court 
services for all Pennsylvanians.  

As the linguistic diversity in the 
Commonwealth continues to grow, 
the program has focused interpreter 
recruitment efforts on languages 
other than Spanish (LOTS). 

The current interpreter roster 
consists of over 200 interpreters 
representing 34 languages. The 
majority of them are American Sign 
Language and Spanish interpreters, 
which are the two languages of 
highest demand in the court system. 
However, as the demand for LOTS 
languages continues to grow, 
recruiting candidates that have the 
necessary language and interpreting 
skills to become qualified in 
languages such as Arabic, Korean, 
Nepali, Swahili and Vietnamese is 
imperative.

In an attempt to attract qualified 
interpreters with the necessary 
combination of skills, the ICP has 
done community outreach and 

worked closely with organizations 
including:

• 

• 

• 

The Pennsylvania Immigrant 
Citizenship Coalition
The Mayor’s Commission of Afro-
Caribbean Affairs
Professional interpreter 
organizations. 

The program also regularly presents 
at different organizations throughout 
Pennsylvania to promote the use of 
qualified interpreters, explain the role 
of interpreters in legal settings and 
educate the professional community 
about the requirements of the Court 
Interpreters and Administrative 
Proceedings Act (Act 172). Many of 
these presentations are now aimed 
at familiarizing not only interpreters, 
but also judges, administrators, 
the legal community and other 
stakeholders with Act 172 and its 
regulations.

Interested parties can learn more 
about the ICP and how to qualify 
as an interpreter on the judiciary’s 
website.

{Osvaldo R. Avilés is the 
Interpreter Certification 
Program administrator.}

Looking up 
court data 
just became 
easier

Data dashboards are used to identify 
court trends and are heavily relied upon 
by judges and court staff to manage court 
operations. In addition to being a valuable 
resource for court management, the 
dashboards also help to assure court data 
is easily accessible and transparent.

The AOPC recently redesigned the 
dashboard homepage and created six 
new data dashboards.

The new dashboards come as the latest 
in a series of interactive, digital data 
visuals that simplify how users look 
up court data. They allow court staff, 
researchers, reporters and the public to 
quickly sift through caseload data and 
analyze and interpret court statistics at a 
glance. 

A wide range of caseload data is 
accessible through the dashboards 
including civil, criminal, magisterial 
district court, orphans’ court, custody and 
divorce, child dependency, paternity and 
support, juvenile delinquency, problem-
solving courts and protection from abuse 
statistics. 

Data are used by the judiciary in policy 
development, program evaluation 
and workload analysis – and also by 
organizations outside the judiciary 
including the Legislature and other 
county, state and federal agencies.

The AOPC publishes caseload statistics 
annually and this data is available both 
statewide and at the county level on the 
judiciary’s website at www.pacourts.us 
under the “Research and Statistics” page.

AOPC’s 
Human 
Resources 
director 
retires

David W. Kutz has retired as the director of 
Human Resources after nearly 29 years of 
exemplary service at the AOPC. 

In his 11 years as director, Kutz has worked 
hard to create a work culture that allows 
employees to perform their jobs unimpeded. 

“We help people through some of their 
worst days, but we hope to treat everyone 
with respect and help as best we can,” said 
Kutz. 

When asked about his time as director, Kutz 
expressed the immense gratitude he has for 
his staff.

“I need to give credit to the team,” Kutz said. 
“I’ve worked with an outstanding group of 
people and I am so proud of them.”

Prior to being hired as a retirements and 
benefits counselor at the AOPC in 1989, 
Kutz worked at the Pennsylvania Treasury 
Department for seven years as an auditing 
supervisor for public schools and State 
Employee Retirement Systems. 

Kutz is a Cumberland County native, having 
grown up and lived his whole life in the area. 
Upon his retirement, Kutz said he is looking 
forward to spending time traveling with his 
wife and volunteering as much as he can. 

“I love to talk with people when we travel,” 
Kutz said. “Everybody has a story and I 
love to hear them. It’s my favorite part of 
traveling.”

Kutz’s notable career truly illustrates the 
success that comes with compassion and 
hard work. 

He is confident that he is leaving his 
department in the absolute best hands with 
Denise S. Parise, who succeeded him as 
director of Human Resources and Hiliary 
Bower, as assistant director of Human 
Resources.

How to manage a 
high-profile trial

Bill Cosby exits Montgomery County Courthouse

While no court hopes to be faced with 
the daunting task of managing a high-
profile trial, Montgomery and Centre 
counties have found themselves 
subject to this challenge recently and 
are sharing the lessons learned from 
their experiences. 

The AOPC/Communications office 
spoke with Michael R. Kehs, Esq., 
district court administrator for 
Montgomery County, and Kendra J. 
Miknis, district court administrator 
for Centre County, to learn how they 
were able to successfully manage 
several high-profile cases - the 
indictment of Bill Cosby, the Sandusky 
trial and the death of Beta Theta Pi 
pledge, Timothy Piazza at Penn State.

Kehs said that while it might seem 
improbable, high-profile cases can 
arise anywhere, at any time, and they 
don’t necessarily have to involve 
an international celebrity - a local 
homicide or civil case can generate 
widespread media interest just as 
well.

“Our courts conduct trials every 
day, but the “high profile” part 
encompasses all of the other, outside 

distractions. Our mindset going into 
our recent high-profile trials was - let 
the story be what happens inside the 
courtroom, not outside of it,” Kehs 
said. 

“When a case attracts the 
attention of local, state, 
national and international 
news outlets, the preparation 
that goes into a typical 
court hearing can change 
significantly.” - Kendra Mikinis

Kehs and Miknis agreed that there 
are three areas of focus that are most 
important to ensure a smooth trial – 
logistics, decorum orders and media 
relations. 

Logistics 

With such an extensive amount of 
media attention and public interest 
surrounding them, high-profile cases 
require an immense amount of 
logistical planning.

“Preparing for such cases come with 
early mornings and late evenings at 

the courthouse, where time is often 
spent planning for details like parking, 
staffing, media placement, courtroom 
logistics and security,” said Miknis. 

Kehs also explained the logistical 
challenges involved with handling the 
jurors in a high-profile trial including 
accommodations for their security, 
transportation, hotel, food, etc. 

In addition to developing a website 
specific to the trial, Montgomery 
County most recently worked closely 
with the County Office of Public Safety 
to utilize the ReadyNotify alert system 
for all trial-related communications. 
Kehs praised the system saying, “it 
worked like a charm.”

“The alert system allowed individuals 
from both the media and the public 
to sign up for alerts, while avoiding 
the potential for inappropriate 
“responses” under a Twitter-like 
account.

“Individuals received alerts via the 
app, text and/or e-mail within seconds 
of transmission, and in this modern 
media era, every second counts,” he 
said.

The Decorum Order

Miknis and Kehs both agreed that 
decorum orders are another essential 
part of ensuring court proceedings 
run smoothly.

These orders can include issues 
related to any prohibitions on 
electronic devices, seating 
availability, transmittal of information, 
etc. 

Miknis explained that decorum orders allow for the 
media and public attending the hearing to have a clear 
understanding of what will and will not be permitted during 
the proceedings, and are crucial to maintaining order in the 
courtroom. 

Media Relations

“Developing a relationship with the media is critical to 
successfully managing a high-profile trial,” said Kehs. “AOPC 
Communications has already developed an outstanding 
relationship with the media, so reach out to them for 
guidance.”

In agreement with Kehs, Miknis said the most important 
part of effectively preparing for a high-profile case is 
having good working relationships with all parties involved, 
including the media. 

“Since becoming Centre County’s District Court 
Administrator in 2015, I have worked with numerous visiting 
and/or senior judges, Commonwealth attorneys, defense 
attorneys, news personalities and news producers, and the 
relationships that I have developed with these individuals 
have proven to be immensely beneficial, assisting in 
productive planning and consistently open communication,” 
said Miknis. 

While a large media presence at the trial can certainly 
create logistical challenges, Kehs said that Pennsylvania’s 

Newsmedia and Broadcasters Associations were extremely 
helpful throughout the process and assisted the Court with 
press credentialing and communication with their members.

Final Thoughts

Kehs stressed the importance of remembering that the high-
profile trial is likely not the only event taking place at the 
courthouse that day, and the regular business of the Court 
must continue. 

“Cooperation on all fronts is critical to maintaining a sense of 
normalcy in the courthouse. Everyone needs to understand 
that the entire justice system is “on trial” in these cases – we 
sink or swim together,” he said. 

“If we do our jobs well, the story is the trial. If 
we do our jobs poorly, however, we become part 
of the story.” - Michael Kehs 

“High-profile cases require increased attention outside the 
normal amount of time, resources and planning spent on 
routine court proceedings. Adjusting normal practices only 
ensures that all involved remain safe, and disruptions and 
unexpected situations remain minimal,” Miknis concluded.

Lawyer by day, hero by night 

Robert Krandel Esq., legal counsel for the AOPC, has been 
a volunteer firefighter for almost seven years. In January of 
2011, Bob recognized a need for more volunteer firefighters 
in his community and decided to answer the call. 

“It was something that the community in my town really 
needed,” said Krandel. “I thought if I could help, then I 
should.” 

Krandel said that while being a volunteer firefighter is 
definitely a lot of work, it’s something he enjoys doing. 

He recalled times when he’s been on a site putting out a fire 
where despite atrocious living conditions, the home still had 
working smoke alarms. 

“It’s important to educate and engage children about fire 
safety at a young age while their minds are still sponges,” 
said Krandel.

Talking about the importance of having working smoke 
alarms and preventing fire hazards with kids can help save 
lives. 

The Wall That Heals

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund unveiled a half-scale replica of 
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. in 1996, designed to 
travel to communities throughout the United States. Since its dedication, 
The Wall That Heals has been on display in nearly 600 communities 
throughout the nation.

The exhibit is 375 feet in length and 7.5 feet high at its tallest point. 

This spring it was on display in Harrisburg and AOPC photographer Justin 
Scott captured some touching moments.

Legislative roundup

by Damian J. Wachter, Esq.

The legislature wrapped up its spring session at the end of June and several pieces 
of legislation of interest advanced or were enacted.  

Domestic violence (DV) –  
The governor signed legislation 
allowing president judges to adopt 
pretrial risk assessment tools for 
use by bail-issuing authorities in 
DV cases to determine whether a 
defendant poses a threat of danger 
to the victim and whether to admit 
a defendant to bail. The Sentencing 
Commission is required to develop a 
model risk assessment tool, however 
adoption of the model and use of 
the tools by president judges is 
discretionary. 

Other pending legislation enacts 
significant changes to the Protection 
from Abuse (PFA) statute including 
the:

•  Creation of a new Extreme Risk 

Protection Order 

• 

Enhancement of the firearm 
relinquishment requirements 
following convictions for 
misdemeanor DV offenses and 
the issuance of PFA orders or 
consent agreements

The legislature may consider these 
additional DV initiatives this fall.

Clean Slate – The legislature 
expanded the “limited access” 
provisions enacted in Act 5 of 2016, 
allowing for the petition for removal 
of criminal history record information 
from public view for qualifying 
misdemeanors and ungraded 
offenses punishable by no more 
than five years imprisonment. The 
expanded petition process takes 
effect Dec. 25, 2018.

Additionally, the legislature enacted 
new provisions to automatically 
remove criminal history record 
information from public view 
for second and third degree 
misdemeanors, misdemeanors 
punishable by no more than two 
years imprisonment, summary 
offenses after the passage of 10 
years as well as non-conviction 
information. The automatic process 
will take effect June 28, 2019.

Certain offenses are exempt from 
limited access and clean slate 
eligibility and individuals with 
extensive conviction records or 
convictions for serious offenses are 
ineligible. Both enactments require 
the completion of all court-ordered 
obligations.

Constitutional amendments for 
merit selection and judicial district 
elections – Both amendments 
deal with the Supreme, Superior 
and Commonwealth Courts. Under 
the merit selection proposal, the 
legislature creates three judicial 
districts – eastern, middle and 
western – from which the governor 
appoints individuals recommended 
by a nominating commission to 
fill judicial vacancies. A two-thirds 
Senate vote is required to confirm 
appointees. 

Under the judicial election proposal, 
an independent commission draws 
districts for the three appellate 
courts. Upon expiration of a current 
appellate jurist’s term, he/she runs in 
a competitive election for a full term 
and retention thereafter. 

The process of amending the 
Constitution requires the House and 
Senate to pass identical resolutions 
in back-to-back legislative sessions, 
which has not yet happened, 
followed by the passage of a ballot 
question.

assistant director of
