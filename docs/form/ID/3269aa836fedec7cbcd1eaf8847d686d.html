2.  TRIAL DE NOVO.  This appeal trial is called a "trial de novo." What that means is 

that  this  trial  is  a  whole  new  trial  just  as  though  the  original  small  claims  trial  never 

occurred.    At  this  new  trial,  the  Plaintiff  must  establish  his  or  her  claim  (the  legal  right  to 

recover  from  the  Defendant)  and  the  Plaintiff  must  establish  with  reasonable  certainty  the 

amount of money owed.  The Defendant can present any defenses he or she may have.  

Please note, however, that while the original small claims case was an informal trial, this 

trial  is  a  formal  civil  trial  and  the  formal  rules  of  evidence  and  procedure  apply.    For 

instance, hearsay evidence, if objected to, will not be allowed.  If you have any questions, 

talk to your attorney. 

3.    JURISDICTIONAL  LIMITS.    Because  this  is  a  trial  de  novo,  and  because  it  is  a 

formal  civil  trial,  and  because  the  formal  rules  of  evidence  and  procedure  apply,  and 

because  each  party  has  the  right  to  be  represented  by  an  attorney,  and  because  either 

party can have a jury trial if timely requested, and because the Court at this level is a court 

of  record,  the  Idaho  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  in  this  type  of  a  trial,  all  due  process 

requirements  have  been  met,  and  therefore  the  jurisdictional  limit  of  $5,000.00  which 

applies  to  an  original  small  claims  case  does  not  apply  to  a  small  claims  appeal.    See 

Gilbert v. Moore, 108 Idaho 165, 697 P.2d 1179 (1985).  If you have any questions, talk to 

your attorney.  

4.    PLEADINGS.    Each  party  is  required  to  file  with  the  Court  a  short,  concise 

statement of their claims and/or defenses (as is applicable).  This statement shall be filed 

at least two (2) weeks before the trial date set in this case.  A copy of the filed statement 

shall be provided to the opposing party at the address listed in this order. 

5.  DISCOVERY.  In conjunction with the statement of each parties' claims/defenses 

as stated in paragraph 4 immediately above, each party shall submit to the Court a list of 

witnesses they anticipate calling at the trial in this matter.  That list is to be submitted to 

the Court at least two (2) weeks before the trial date in this matter.  A copy of that list is to 

be mailed to the opposing party at the address given below. 

6.  TRIAL COURT EXHIBITS.  Exhibits used in the original Small Claims Court Case 

may or may not be in the Court's file.  The exhibits may have been returned to the parties 

at the end of the original small claims trial.  If the exhibits are still in the Clerk's file and the 

parties wish to retrieve those exhibits, they should contact the Clerk's Office.  Only those 

exhibits  submitted  by  the  party  will  be  returned  to  that  party.    Only  the  exhibits  properly 

introduced into evidence during the new trial in this case will be considered by the Court.

CAO SC 11-2  07/01/2016

or the Court. 

Of course, a party may introduce new and additional exhibits not used in the original small 

claims case.  It is the respective parties' responsibility to locate the exhibits, not the Clerk 

7.    WITNESSES.    Each  party  may  subpoena  witnesses  to  the  trial  but  all  subpoena 

service costs and witness fees shall be paid for by the party issuing the subpoenas to the 

witness and shall not be taxed as costs in the small claims proceeding over the amount of 

$50.00. See I.R.S.C.A. 8 and 15(e). 

8.  PRE-TRIAL HEARINGS.  Pre-trial hearings shall be conducted 

pursuant  to  Motion  and  Notice  as  required  by  the  Idaho  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.    The 

parties should check with the Clerk for available Court times to hear pre-trial matters. 

9.  DEFAULT.  Failure by either party to appear at the trial shall subject that party to a 

Default Judgment if the party is the Defendant or a Dismissal with prejudice if the party is 

10.    SETTLEMENT.    The  parties  are  expected  to  discuss  settlement.    If  the  case  is 

settled the parties are to notify the Clerk's Office immediately.  Written proof of settlement 

the Plaintiff. 

should be filed.  

11.    ATTORNEYS.    Attorneys  are  permitted  to  appear  before  the  Court  on  Small 

Claims Appeal.  Attorney fees the Court can award, however, are limited to $25.00 to the 

prevailing  party,  (see  Idaho  Code  §1-2311  and  Idaho  Rules  for  Small  Claims  Actions 

15(f)).  The  Idaho  Supreme  Court  has  consistently  held  that  a  party  may  represent 

themselves.    However,  the  Supreme  Court  has  also  consistently  held  that  when  a  party 

undertakes  to  represent  himself  or  herself  in  a  case  in  which  that  party  is  entitled  to  be 

represented  by  an  attorney,  that  party  is  held  to  the  same  standards  and  to  the  same 

requirements  as  if  the  party  were  represented  by  an  attorney.    In  other  words,  if  you 

choose to represent yourself, it is no excuse that you are not a lawyer and that you may or 

may not know the applicable law and rules.  You are held to the standard of an attorney.  

If you have any questions, please contact your attorney. 

12.  RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.  Please note and read that pursuant to Idaho Rules 

for  Small  Claims  Actions  15(d),  you  have  the  right  to  a  trial  by  jury  if  timely  requested.  

This Court requires a demand for jury trial by you to be filed within fourteen (14) days of 

the date of this order.  If you have any questions, please contact your attorney. 

13.  ADDRESSES.  The Court files in this matter reflect the following addresses and 

phone numbers for the parties:
