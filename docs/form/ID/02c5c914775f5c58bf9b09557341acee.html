this Court should control. (If the order was from a different case you may have to file a Motion to 

Consolidate to avoid having multiple child support orders.) 

Section 6. Complete all of Section 6 below to change child support. 

6.   a.  Reasons for Changing Child Support.  The following substantial and material 

changes since the date of the last Order, Judgment or Decree have occurred.  

(check all boxes that apply): 

 The custodial arrangement.  
 The gross annual income of one or both parents.

 (other reason)   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b. New Child Support Amount.  

 Child support should be paid by (full name of parent who will pay support)  

 in the amount of $ 

per month, based on the Idaho Child Support Guidelines. This is based on the 

Affidavit Verifying Income and Child Support Worksheet(s) attached as “Schedule 

B”. (see Recommended Adjusted support in the worksheet.)

c.  Effective Date and Duration. 

  Child support payments should begin (select one option): 

   the month after petition is filed. or  

 

 the month after the Judgment is signed. 

Child support should continue to be paid on the same day of each following month 

until the child/ren for whom support is being paid reach/es the age of eighteen. If a 

child for whom support is being paid continues his/her high school education after 

reaching the age of eighteen (18) years, child support payments should continue 

PETITION TO MODIFY AN ORDER, JUDGMENT, OR DECREE (HW) 
CAO GCSM 1-1 04/01/2018 

 

 

     PAGE 4 

until the child discontinues his/her high school education or reaches the age of 

nineteen (19) years, whichever is sooner. Payment should be made payable to the 

Department of Health and Welfare and sent to Idaho Child Support Receipting, P.O. 

Box 70008, Boise, ID 83707-0108. 

Notice 
The court is required to order income withholding in all child support orders. 
Income withholding is enforced by a withholding order issued to the paying parent’s 
employer without additional notice to the paying parent, according to Idaho Code 
Section 32-1204.  
The support order can also be enforced by license suspension or the filing of a lien 
upon all real and personal property of the paying parent. 
 

d. Multiple Children. (if applicable) 

 We have more than one minor child. If this child support judgment has not been 

modified, when one child is no longer entitled to support, basic child support for the 

remaining child/ren should continue and will be paid as described in the Continued 

Support Worksheet attached as Schedule B. 

e.  Extended Visits. (if applicable) 

 Our child/ren live/s in the home of one parent at least 75% of the time. (If selected, 
check the boxes below that apply. Otherwise, go to the next section.) 
 When the parent paying child support has physical custody of the child/ren for 14 

or more overnights in a row, the amount of basic child support should be reduced 

for that period of time. However, visitation of two overnights or less with the other 

parent should not eliminate the reduction of basic child support during extended 

visits. The child support reduction for the period of the actual physical custody 

should be  50% or   (other percentage)  

 

% of the basic child support 

obligation. The reduction should be subtracted from the child support payment due 

the month following the extended visit.   

  If the parent paying child support has physical custody of some but not all of the 

children for a period of 14 overnights in a row, before a reduction is made, the basic 

child support obligation should first be divided by the number of children under 

eighteen (18) years of age. The parent who pays child support can only claim a 

reduction for the child/ren in that parent’s custody.  

For Example—Parent has 3 of 4 children for 14 overnights. $300/mo. basic 
support payment divided by 4 children = $75 per child per month divided by 30 = 
$2.50 per day per child x 14 = $35.00 x 3 for 3 children = $105.00. Reduction = 
50% of $105 or $52.50.

  2.  All health care premiums should be in addition to the basic child support 

award and should be promptly paid or reimbursed directly between the parents.  

Notice 
Where medical insurance is provided, each parent should be ordered to provide the 
other with all medical insurance information necessary to obtain health care and 
process insurance claims for the child/ren.  Insurance proceeds should be applied 
first to unpaid medical bills and then to reimburse the paying parent for any prepaid 
medical costs.  Both parents should be ordered to sign any needed document that 
provides continuing health care for the child/ren. 
 
Failure to provide medical insurance coverage may result in the direct enforcement 
of a medical support order by either the obligee (party or parent other than the 
parent ordered to carry or provide a health benefit plan for the parties' minor 
child/ren) or the Department of Health and Welfare.  A national medical support 
notice will be sent to your employer, requiring your employer to enroll the child in a

Code, and applicable rules of the department.

Health care expenses include, but are not limited to, medical, prescription, dental, 

orthodontic, optical, psychiatric, psychological, special education, addiction 

treatment, or counseling in any form. 

Any health care for the child/ren that would result in an actual out-of-pocket expense 

of over $500 to the parent who did not incur or consent to the expense, must be 

approved in advance, in writing, by both parents or by prior court order. (Note: The 

court may consider whether consent for out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500 

was unreasonably requested or withheld and order payment of the incurred 

expense in some percentage other than the Guidelines Income.)   

All health care payments should be in addition to the basic child support award and 

should be promptly paid or reimbursed directly between the parents.  

i.   Tax Benefits & Exemptions.

The parent not receiving the exemption(s) should be awarded a pro rata share of 

the value of income tax benefit in proportion to his/her guidelines income which 

should be either a credit against or in addition to the basic child support obligation.  

  You must not claim the exemption if it is not assigned to you.  If the exemption is 

not assigned to you, you must sign and provide to the other parent all required 

Internal Revenue Service form(s), including IRS Form 8332, by January 31st of 

6. All terms of the Court’s prior Order(s), Judgment(s) or Decrees(s) not modified by this 

Judgment remain in full force and effect. 

HEREFORE, the moving party asks that the court enter its Judgment of Modification

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
