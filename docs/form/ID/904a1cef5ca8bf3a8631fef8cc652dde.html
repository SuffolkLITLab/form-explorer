 No.  I ask for it to continue. (If the order was from a different case please attach a copy of that 
order, judgment, or decree as Schedule B, skip section 10, and sign at the end.) 
 Yes. The amount of child support should be changed and the judgment issued by this 

Court should control. (If the order was from a different case you may have to file a Motion to 

Consolidate to avoid having multiple child support orders.)  
(Note: Complete all of Section 10. below to change child support.)

(Attach Affidavit Verifying Income and Child Support Worksheet(s) as Schedule B.) 

b.  Effective Date and Duration. 

Child support payments should begin (select one option): 
   the month after petition is filed. or  

   the month after the Decree is signed. 

Child support should continue to be paid on the same day of each following month until 

the child/ren for whom support is being paid reach/es the age of eighteen. If a child for 

whom support is being paid continues his/her high school education after reaching the 

age of eighteen (18) years, child support payments should continue until the child 

discontinues his/her high school education or reaches the age of nineteen (19) years, 

whichever is sooner. Payment should be made payable to the Department of Health and 

Welfare and sent to Idaho Child Support Receipting, P.O. Box 70008, Boise, ID 83707-

0108. 

NOTICE 

The court is required to order income withholding in all child support orders. Income 
withholding is enforced by a withholding order issued to the paying parent’s employer 
without additional notice to the paying parent, according to Idaho Code Section 32-1204.  
The support order can also be enforced by license suspension or the filing of a lien upon 
all real and personal property of the paying parent. 

.  Multiple Children. (if applicable) 

  c

 We have more than one minor child. If this child support Decree has not been 

modified, when one child is no longer entitled to support, child support for the remaining 

child/ren should continue and will be paid as described in the Continued Support 

Worksheet attached as Schedule B.   

d. Extended Visits. (if applicable) 

 Our child/ren live/s in the home of one parent at least 75% of the time. (If selected, check 
the boxes below that apply. Otherwise, go to the next section.) 
 When the parent paying child support has physical custody of the child/ren for 14 or 

more overnights in a row, the amount of basic child support should be reduced for that 

period of time. However, visitation of two overnights or less with the other parent should 

PETITION FOR PATERNITY, CUSTODY, VISITATION, & SUPPORT 
CAO P 1-2   04/01/2018 

PAGE 6  

not eliminate the reduction of basic child support during extended visits. The child 
support reduction for the period of the actual physical custody should be  50% or   

(other percentage)  

 

% of the basic child support obligation. The reduction should 

be subtracted from the child support payment due the month following the extended visit.   

  If the parent paying child support has physical custody of some but not all of the 

children for a period of 14 overnights in a row, before a reduction is made, the basic 

child support obligation should first be divided by the number of children under eighteen 

(18) years of age. The parent who pays child support can only claim a reduction for the 

child/ren in that parent’s custody.  

For Example—Parent has 3 of 4 children for 14 overnights. $300/mo. basic support 
payment divided by 4 children = $75 per child per month divided by 30 = $2.50 per 
day per child x 14 = $35.00 x 3 for 3 children = $105.00. Reduction = 50% of $105 or 
$52.50. 

e.  Work-Related Childcare Expenses.  

Child support does not include work-related childcare.  The net out-of-pocket costs for 

work-related child care should be paid by the parents based on the Idaho Child Support

between the parents.  or 

  2.  All health care premiums should be in addition to the basic child support award 

and should be promptly paid or reimbursed directly between the parents.  

NOTICE 

Where medical insurance is provided, each parent should be ordered to provide the 
other with all medical insurance information necessary to obtain health care and 
process insurance claims for the child/ren.  Insurance proceeds should be applied first 
to unpaid medical bills and then to reimburse the paying parent for any prepaid 
medical costs.  Both parents should be ordered to sign any needed document that 
provides continuing health care for the child/ren. 
 
Failure to provide medical insurance coverage may result in the direct enforcement of

ordered to carry or provide a health benefit plan for the parties' minor child/ren) or the 
Department of Health and Welfare.  A national medical support notice will be sent to

Health care expenses include, but are not limited to, medical, prescription, dental, 

orthodontic, optical, psychiatric, psychological, special education, addiction treatment, 

or counseling in any form. 

   Any health care for the child/ren that would result in an actual out-of-pocket expense 

of over $500 to the parent who did not incur or consent to the expense, must be 

approved in advance, in writing, by both parents or by prior court order. (Note: The 

court may consider whether consent for out-of-pocket expenses in excess of $500 

was unreasonably requested or withheld and order payment of the incurred expense 

in some percentage other than the Guidelines Income.)

should be promptly paid or reimbursed directly between the parents.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
