      <pre>CAO CR INSTRUCTION 10-1 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING AN OBJECTION TO INTERCEPTED TAX RETURN  
 

Idaho Code Section 1-1624 authorizes the interception of an Idaho state tax refund to pay for 
delinquent debts owed by the taxpayer to the courts of Idaho.  A “debt owed to the courts” may 
include any assessment of fines, court costs, surcharges, penalties, fees, restitution, moneys 
expended in providing counsel and other defense services to indigent defendants, or other 
charges which a court judgment has ordered to be paid to the court.  A debt owed to the court is 
delinquent when it is not paid according to the terms of the judgment or agreement entered into 
between the court and the taxpayer which required the payment. 

hen You Should Use Form CAO CR 10-1 Objection to Intercepted Tax Return. 

f you are a taxpayer who has received notice that your state tax refund has been intercepted to 
pay for a delinquent debt you owe to the courts of Idaho you may file a written objection to  this 
set off within twenty one (21) days after the notice was mailed to you (not counting Saturday, 
Sunday or a state holiday as the twenty-first day).  No issues or claims previously decided in a 
court order or judgment or admitted or agreed to by you can be considered in this request. To 
file a written objection to the set off you may use form CAO CR 10-1 Objection to Intercepted 
Tax Return.  Instructions on how to complete this form are outlined below. 

f you are a taxpayer who filed a joint return with your spouse and it is your spouse and not you, 
who is obligated to the courts, you may file a written objection within 21 days as specified above 
requesting the set off be limited to one half (1/2) of the joint refund with the remaining one half 
(1/2) to be refunded to you.  To file this objection you may use the same form CAO CR 10-1 
Objection to Intercepted Tax Return.   

ompleting Form CAO CR 10-1. 

  Complete the form by typing or neatly and legibly printing in black ink.  Fill in your full current 
name, address and telephone number on the lines provided at the upper left hand corner of 
page 1.  Fill in the judicial district and the county where the case is pending in the heading in 
capital letters (for example “IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND JUDICIAL 
DISTRICT IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF LATAH”).  Fill in the name of the defendant in 
the caption as well as the case number just as they appear in the Notice you received from 
the court which indicated the tax refund had been intercepted.   
 
In the first paragraph, insert your full name and mailing address.   

In the second paragraph, check this box only if you are the taxpayer who is obligated to the 
court, but feel an error has been made. You must then describe with specificity, the error 
and any other facts which would justify a waiver. 

 

 

•  Check the box in the third paragraph if you filed a joint return with your spouse and it is your 
spouse, and not you, who is obligated to the court and you are objecting to the interception 
of your portion of the joint refund.   

•  Check the box in the fourth paragraph if you have a payment agreement and have paid as 

much or more than is due to date on your payment agreement.

iling the Request/Objection with the Court. 

nce you have completed form CAO CR 10-1, file the form with the court in the county 

identified in the Notice you received.  How your request is handled after filing may differ from 
county to county,.  You may generally expect your request to be handled in the following ways: 

  Objections by non-obligated spouses requesting the return of one half (1/2) of an 

intercepted joint refund are verified upon receipt of the objection.  The court will first verify 
the intercepted refund was a refund from a joint return and you are the non-obligated 
spouse who filed the joint tax return.  Once this information is verified, if there are no 
questions, the clerk will then send to your mailing address a document entitled “NOTICE OF 
REFUND FOLLOWING SUBSTANTIATED OBJECTION OF INTERCEPTED TAX RETURN 
I.C.§ 1-1624” along with a check for one half (1/2) of the amount intercepted.  If the clerk 
has any questions about this, the matter will be presented to the presiding judge for 
consideration, and a hearing may be necessary.  You will be informed by the court clerk if a 
hearing before a judge is necessary.  If so, you must personally attend or your request may 
be denied.  Once the judge has made a decision, an “ORDER RE: OBJECTION OF 
INTERCEPTED TAX RETURN I.C.§ 1-1624” which describes that decision will be mailed to 
you at the mailing address you have listed in your request. 
 

•  Objections by the obligated taxpayer are presented to the presiding judge for consideration.  
The judge may or may not require a hearing.  You will be informed by the court clerk if a 
hearing before a judge is necessary.  If so, you must personally attend or your objection(?) 
may be denied.  Once the judge has made a decision, either with or without a hearing, an 
“ORDER RE: OBJECTION OF INTERCEPTED TAX RETURN I.C.§ 1-1624” which 
describes that decision will be mailed to you at the mailing address you have listed in your 
request. 

Any questions about hearing requirements or how your request will be processed should be 
directed to the court clerk in the county where the request is filed.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
