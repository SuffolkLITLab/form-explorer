 Yes. The amount of child support should be changed and the judgment issued by this 

Court should control. (If the order was from a different case you may have to file a Motion to 

Consolidate to avoid having multiple child support orders.)  

NOTE: Complete all of Section 9. below to change child support. 

c.  Reasons for Changing Child Support.   

The following substantial and material changes since the date of the last Order, 

Judgment or Decree have occurred. (check all boxes that apply): 

   The custodial arrangement. 
   The gross annual income of one or both parents.

per month, based on the Idaho Child Support Guidelines.  This is based on the Affidavit 

Verifying Income and Child Support Worksheet(s) attached as “Schedule B”. (see 

Recommended Adjusted support in the worksheet)

b.  Effective Date and Duration. 

  Child support payments should begin (select one option): 

 the month after petition is filed. or  
   the month after the Decree is signed. 

Child support should continue to be paid on the same day of each following month until the 

child/ren for whom support is being paid reach/es the age of eighteen. If a child for whom 

support is being paid continues his/her high school education after reaching the age of 

FAMILY CASE RESPONSE AND COUNTERCLAIM (WITH CHILDREN) 
CAO FL 3-5  04/01/2018 

PAGE 7 

eighteen (18) years, child support payments should continue until the child discontinues 

his/her  high  school  education  or  reaches  the  age  of  nineteen  (19)  years,  whichever  is 

sooner.  Payment should be made payable to the Department of Health and Welfare and 

sent to Idaho Child Support Receipting, P.O. Box 70008, Boise, ID 83707-0108. 

 
Notice 
The court is required to order income withholding in all child support orders. Income 
withholding is enforced by a withholding order issued to the paying parent’s employer 
without additional notice to the paying parent, according to Idaho Code Section 32-1204.  
The support order can also be enforced by license suspension or the filing of a lien upon 
all real and personal property of the paying parent. 

.  Multiple Children. (if applicable) 
 We have more than one minor child. If this child support Decree has not been 

modified, when one child is no longer entitled to support, child support for the remaining 

child/ren should continue and will be paid as described in the Continued Support 

  c

Worksheet attached as Schedule B. 

d. Extended Visits. (if applicable) 
 Our child/ren live/s in the home of one parent at least 75% of the time. (If selected, 

check the boxes below that apply. Otherwise, go to the next section.) 

 When the parent paying child support has physical custody of the child/ren for 14 

or more overnights in a row, the amount of basic child support should be reduced for 

that period of time. However, visitation of two overnights or less with the other parent 

should not eliminate the reduction of basic child support during extended visits. The 

child support reduction for the period of the actual physical custody should be  50% 

or   (Other percentage) ____% of the basic child support obligation. The reduction 

should be subtracted from the child support payment due the month following the 

extended visit.   

  If the parent paying child support has physical custody of some but not all of the 

children for a period of 14 overnights in a row, before a reduction is made, the basic 

child support obligation should first be divided by the number of children under 18 

years of age. The parent who pays child support can only claim a reduction for the 

child/ren in that parent’s custody.  

For Example—Parent has 3 of 4 children for 14 overnights. $300/mo. basic support 
payment divided by 4 children = $75 per child per month divided by 30 = $2.50 per 
day per child x 14 = $35.00 x 3 for 3 children = $105.00. Reduction = 50% of $105 or 
$52.50. 

e.  Work-Related Childcare Expenses.  

FAMILY CASE RESPONSE AND COUNTERCLAIM (WITH CHILDREN) 
CAO FL 3-5  04/01/2018 

PAGE 8 

Child support does not include work-related childcare.  The net out-of-pocket costs for 

work-related child care should be paid by the parents based on the Idaho Child Support 

(Attach Affidavit Verifying Income and Child Support Worksheet(s) as Schedule B.) 

Payment should be made directly to the child care provider by both parents according to 

arrangements made with the care provider if permitted by the care provider. Otherwise, 

the non-paying parent should reimburse the paying parent within 10 days after the paying 

parent provides a copy of the invoice and proof of payment.

C. In Addition to or Included in Monthly Child Support. (select one)

of health insurance premiums.  All other health care payments are in addition to the basic 

child support award and should be promptly paid or reimbursed directly between the 

parents.  or 

  2.  All health care premiums should be in addition to the basic child support award 

and should be promptly paid or reimbursed directly between the parents. 

NOTICE 

Where medical insurance is provided, each parent should be ordered to provide the 
other with all medical insurance information necessary to obtain health care and process 
insurance claims for the child/ren.  Insurance proceeds should be applied first to unpaid 
medical bills and then to reimburse the paying parent for any prepaid medical costs.  
Both parents should be ordered to sign any needed document that provides continuing 
health care for the child/ren. 
 
 
Failure to provide medical insurance coverage may result in the direct enforcement of a 
medical support order by either the obligee (party or parent other than the parent ordered

in advance, in writing, by both parents or by prior court order. (Note: The court may
