CITATION TO DISCOVER ASSETS 
 
TO DEBTOR'S BANK 
  

 
 

 

Enter the Case Number given by the Circuit Clerk: _________________________________ 
 

 

 

 

 

If you do not answer or come to the court date listed in section 3, the judge may do one of two things: 

 

 

 

o	 
Issue a rule to show cause; OR 
o	  Enter a conditional judgment. 

Notice to Bank 
 
 

 

 

If there is a rule to show cause court date, you will have to explain why you did not come to court on the court date 
and why you should not be found in contempt of court. If you do not come to the rule to show cause on the set 
 
court date, the judge may find you in contempt, and you might be arrested and jailed. 
If the court enters a conditional judgment, you will have 30 days to answer or appear. If you fail to do so, then the 
court may enter a final judgment against you.

6.	  The bank’s duties and obligations: 
 

 

 

 

You must file the Answer on page 4 telling the Court about all accounts or safety deposit 
boxes that the debtor may have an ownership interest in or appears as a signatory. 
You must not transfer (sell, give away or get rid of) any property not exempt from the 
enforcement of a judgment. This prohibition shall remain in effect until further order of the 
court or termination of the proceeding. The bank is required to withhold double the 
unpaid amount listed below in paragraph 8.  The bank is not required to withhold 
beyond double the unpaid amount listed below. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

If the account consists solely of funds that can be identified as exempt under federal or state 
law, the bank is PROHIBITED from withholding the funds, and the bank must respond 
that the funds are exempt.  Deposited funds that are exempt under federal and state law 
include Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Social Security Retirement 
Insurance (SSRI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), veteran’s benefits, public assistance 
 
 
benefits, unemployment compensation benefits, child support and/or circuit breaker property 
tax relief benefits. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.  The debtor has the right to claim certain protections (“exemptions”). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Social Security, Supplemental Security Income benefits, and disability; 
Public assistance benefits; 
Child support; 
Unemployment compensation benefits; 

If the debtor claims an exemption, the income or property covered by that exemption 
cannot be taken to pay the judgment. Here are some exemptions the debtor may 
 
be able to claim: 
1.  Money or belongings up to $4,000 ("wildcard exemption"); 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6.  Workers’ compensation benefits; 
7. 
8. 
9. 
10.  Debtor’s equity interest, up to $1,500, in any professional books, or tools of their trade; 
11.  Pension and retirement benefits and refunds; AND 
12.  Debtor’s equity interest, up to $15,000, in the house they live in. 

Veteran’s benefits; 
 
Circuit breaker property tax relief benefits; 
Debtor’s equity interest, up to $2,400, in any one motor vehicle; 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To debtor: see 
Emergency Motion to 
Claim Exemption for 
 
further instruction on 
 
how to ask the court 
 
for these exemptions. 

 

 

 
 

The debtor has the right at the court date listed in section 3 to declare property or income 
 
as exempt. The debtor also has the right to ask for these exemptions at an earlier date by 
 
notifying the clerk in writing at the office of the Circuit Clerk. A court date will be promptly set. 
 
Necessary forms must be prepared by the debtor and sent to the bank and the creditor or 
  
the creditor’s attorney.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
