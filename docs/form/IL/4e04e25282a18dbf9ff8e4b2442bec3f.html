This guide will give you general instructions on how to complete a simple divorce case. 

   

 

It cannot and does not try to cover everything that might happen in a divorce case. 
  

 

If you do not understand whether these instructions apply to your case, you should speak 
 
with a lawyer. 
 

How divorce cases are handled by a judge can vary from county to county. 
 

 

 

There may be requirements in your county that are not covered in these instructions. 
  

 

 

Ask the Circuit Clerk if your county has local rules and, if so, where you can get a copy.

INTRODUCTION TO GETTING A 
DIVORCE IN ILLINOIS (WITH 
CHILDREN) 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
  
These instructions apply to marriages and civil unions. 
 
Whenever the instructions say “marriage” it also means 
  
“civil union.” 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Can I ask the court for a divorce in Illinois? 
 
You can ask for a divorce if: 
o  You are married; 
 
  
o  You or your spouse have lived in Illinois for at least 
 
 

 

 

 

 
90 days; AND 

o  There is no other divorce case already filed and still

NOTE: if your spouse is on active military service, you 
can ask for divorce, but the court might not be able to 
 
give you a divorce. If your minor children have not lived 
in Illinois for at least 6 months, the court may not be able 
  
to decide on a parenting plan for the children. 
 
 
What forms do I need to ask the court for a divorce? 
Below are some of the common forms used in divorce 
 
cases. Depending on your specific situation, you may

case. The email address (if you have one) and 
 
mailing address you put on the Petition is where 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share 
with anyone else and that you check every day. If you 
 
 
do not check your email every day, you may miss 
 
important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
documents from other parties.

cannot give you legal advice. 
 

o  Sheriff: You will ask the Sheriff in the county where 
 
 
your spouse lives to serve legal notice on your 
  
spouse.

county seat along with the county courthouse. 
o  Judge: You will see and speak to the judge at your 
 
 

 

 

 
court dates. The judge will listen to evidence from you 
and your spouse and then decide whether you get a 
 
 
divorce.  The judge cannot give you legal advice. 

 

 

 

 

 
 
When will I be divorced? 
 
 
You are divorced when the judge signs the Judgment of 
Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union (Divorce With 
 
Children).

Instruction Book for Dissolution of Marriage Court Forms 

 

 

 

File your forms with the Circuit Clerk in the county 
 
where your court case should be filed. 
  
o  File your case in the county you live in or the county 
 
 

 

 
your spouse lives in. 
o  You must file the Petition for Dissolution of 
 
 

Marriage/Civil Union (Divorce with Children) with the 
trial court by the filing deadline that applies to your 
 
case. 
  

 

 

 

o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
  
available. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms/. 
 

o  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and the

provider. Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-
providers.htm to select a service provider. Some 
service providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file for 
 
free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help user 
 
 
guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/how-to-e-
file/. 
 

   

 

 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your forms. 

o 
 

  

 
Provide notice to your spouse. 
 
There are 2 ways to give notice to your spouse: 

 

 

 
1. Entry of appearance 
 
 
If your spouse signs an Entry of Appearance, you do not 
have to have your spouse served by the Sheriff. You are 
 
 
ready to get a court date (skip to "Ask for a court date" 
 
below); OR 

 
 

 

 

 

 
2. Serve your spouse with a Summons and Petition

Section 7(c): Parenting Plan 
 

 

 

A Parenting Plan contains information about who will 
 
 
make decisions for the children and a schedule for when 
 
the children are with each parent. If you have completed 
the Parenting Plan by the time you are ready to file your 
 
case, you can attach it to your Petition for Dissolution of 
 
Marriage/Civil Union (Divorce with Children). If not, you 
must file it within 120 days of the date you file your 
 
 
Petition. Follow the instructions on the Parenting Plan for 
 
help in completing it. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You must tell the court if you and your spouse have 
debts from the marriage that are still owed. If you and 
 
your spouse cannot agree on how to divide the debt, the 
judge will decide who is responsible for each debt. 
 

 

 

 

 
Sections 9, 10, 11 & 12: Personal Property, Real
 
Estate, Pension/Retirement Accounts & Money 
Claims 
You must tell the court if you and your spouse own 
personal property (clothing/furniture), real estate, or 
 
pension/retirement accounts. If you and your spouse 
cannot agree on how to divide the property, the judge 
will decide who gets the property. 
 
 
Section 13: Maintenance (also known as alimony) 
 
Maintenance is money paid from one spouse to the 
other on a regular basis. 
    
o  To get maintenance, you must show the court there 
 
 
is a good reason such as a long marriage, poor 
 
health, or an inability to support yourself. 
  
o  The judge is not required to order maintenance. 
 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section J: Former Name

former name.
