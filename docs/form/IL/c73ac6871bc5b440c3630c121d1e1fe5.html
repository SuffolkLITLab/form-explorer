when you will see the judge. This form also: 
 
•  Lists the date, time, and place where you will 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
see the judge; 
 

 

•  Lists the names and addresses of the other

serve and where to serve the 
Defendants/Respondents. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
 
and-forms/approved-forms. 
 
Are there any costs associated with a Motion to 
 
 
Appoint Special Process Server? 
o  There may be a fee to file a Motion to Appoint 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

o 
 

 
 
 

  
Special Process Server. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if there is a fee for your Motion 
 
 
to Appoint Special Process Server. Also, many 
 
courts have the court fees listed on their websites. 
 
 
 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees which you 
can find at  illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
  
forms/approved-forms. 
 
o  The special process server typically charges a fee 
 
 
 

 
 
 
and does not have to honor your Order for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What do I do after I fill out the Motion to Appoint 
 
Special Process Server?

that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
  
exemption from e-filing. 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because

What is a special process server? 
 
 
o  A special process server is someone other than the 
 
 
 
sheriff who can serve legal papers. A Motion to 
 
Appoint Special Process Server is a written request 
 
 
to use one. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

When can I use a special process server? 
 
o 
 

 
If you are serving the Defendants/Respondents 
 
outside of Cook County: 
 
•  You can use a licensed private detective to 
 
 

 

 

 

o 
 

serve the Defendants/Respondents. Contact 
 
 
your local Circuit Clerk to find out if you need to 
 
file a Motion to Appoint Special Process Server 
   
 
 
first. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

•  You can use anyone who is 18 years old or over 
 
 
 
and not a party in the case. You must file a 
Motion to Appoint Special Process Server first. 
 
  
If you are serving the Defendants/Respondents in 
 
Cook County: 
 
•  You must use the sheriff to make the first 
 
 
 
attempt at service. 
  
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

 

 

If the Cook County Sheriff is unable to serve the 
Defendants/Respondents, then you may file a 
   
Motion to Appoint Special Process Server. 
 
•  You can use a licensed private detective or 
 
 
 

anyone who is 18 years old or over and not a 
party to the case. 
  

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to file a Motion to 
 
 
Appoint Special Process Server? 
o  Motion to Appoint Special Process Server: Use 
 
 
 
 
this form to ask permission to use a special process 
 
server. The email address (if you have one) and 
mailing address you put on the Motion is where 
 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share 
with anyone else and that you check every day. If 
   
 
you do not check your email every day, you may 
 
miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
 
 
documents from other parties. 
 

 
o  Order Appointing Special Process Server: Is 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used by the judge to say if your Motion to Appoint 
   
 
Special Process Server is granted or denied.
