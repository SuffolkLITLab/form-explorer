HOW TO ASK THE JUDGE TO WAIVE CRIMINAL AND/OR
 
 
TRAFFIC COURT ASSESSMENTS IN COOK COUNTY 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
What are criminal or traffic court assessments? 
  
Assessments are costs charged to a defendant in a 
criminal or traffic case once found guilty. They do not 
 
 
include fines or restitution ordered by the judge to be 
paid by the defendant. They also do not include costs in 
 
civil and juvenile cases. The waiver may not apply to 
 
some court costs and fees associated with your case. 
 
 
 
Who can ask the judge to waive a criminal or traffic
 
 
 
court assessment? 
 
Anyone who must pay an assessment as part of a court 
 
case. You can ask for yourself or a minor child, but not 
 
for anyone else. 
  
 
How will I know if there is an assessment? 
 
You will get a document that tells you if you owe an 
   
assessment. 
  
 
What forms do I need to fill out to ask the judge to 
 
 
waive or reduce assessments? 
 
o  Application for Waiver of Criminal and/or Traffic 
 
 
Court Assessments For Use in Cook County 
 
 
Only is used to tell the judge whether you get any 
 
 
public benefits and your income and expense 
 
information so they can decide if you are eligible for 
 
a waiver of court assessments. 
 
 

How do I prove I cannot afford to pay court 
 
assessments? 
 
The judge may require you to prove the information in 
 
your Application. If you get public benefits you may want 
 
 
to bring current proof of eligibility and a benefits 
 
 
 
statement from the agency providing the benefit. 
 
 
Examples of public benefits are: 
 
o  Supplemental Security Income (SSI, Not Social 
 
 
 

o  Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) 
 
 
o  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) 
  
 
o  Food Stamps (SNAP) 
 
 
o  General Assistance (GA) 
 
 
 
o  Transitional Assistance; State Children and Family 
 
 
 
 

If you don't get public benefits, you may want to bring 
documents showing your income, value of belongings 
 
 
(for example, real estate), and expenses. 
 
 
Can the judge make me pay back assessments after
 
I have been granted a waiver? 
 
 
If the judge grants your Application and later decides 
 
 
that the information you put in your Application was 
 
 
false, the judge can make you pay any assessments that 
 
were waived. 
 

o  Order for Waiver of Criminal and/or Traffic Court 
 
 
Assessments For Use in Cook County Only: Is 
 
 
used by the judge to say your application is granted 
 
or denied.

The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
 
you put on the Application is where important legal 
 
 
documents will be sent to you. You should use an email 
 
account that you do not share with anyone else and that 
 
you check every day. If you do not check your email 
 
every day, you may miss important information, notice of 
 
 
court dates, or documents from other parties. 
 
 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
The Office of the Circuit Clerk in Cook County. You can 
also find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
 
forms/approved-forms. 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 
 
 
 

What happens if my Application is granted? 
 
In a criminal case, depending upon your circumstances, 
 
the judge may order that: 
 
 
o  All of your assessments are waived; 
 
 
o  You must pay 25% of any assessment; 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 50% of any assessment; OR 
 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 75% of any assessment. 
 
 
 
 
In a traffic case, depending upon your circumstances, 
 
the judge may order that: 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 50% of any assessment; 
 
 
 
 
  
o  You must pay 62.5% of any assessment; 
 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 75% of any assessment; OR 
 
 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 87.5% of any assessment.

Step 2: Wait for a decision. 
o  The judge will review your Application and decide 
 
 
 
 
whether you have to pay the assessments. 
o  The judge may need more information from you. If 
   
 
 
 
 
so, the judge may want to have a hearing on your 
 
Application. The judge will notify you if you need to 
 
give more information or documents, or go to see 
 
the judge. 
 

o  After the judge makes a decision, the judge will fill 
 
 
 
 
 
out the Order for Waiver of Criminal and/or Traffic 
 
 
Court Assessments For Use in Cook County Only. 
 
   
 
The Order will say if you have to pay any 
   
assessments. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

o 
 

    
 

o  The Circuit Clerk will tell you how and when you will 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
get a copy of the Order. 
 
If the judge decides you have to pay all or some of 
 
the court assessments, they also may allow you to 
 
 
defer payment to a later date, make installment 
 
payments, or make payment upon other terms and 
 
 
conditions stated in the order.  If you fail to pay as 
 
ordered by the judge, the matter may be referred for 
 
collection, a Petition to Revoke the Sentence may 
   
 
be filed, or the judge may hold you in contempt. If 
 
you are sentenced to probation, conditional 
discharge, or supervision and fail to pay the 
assessment before the end of your sentence, the 
 
 
court could extend your period of probation, 
 
 
 
conditional discharge, or supervision until you pay 
 
the assessment. 
If a cash bond has been posted in the case, then the 
cash bond may be used to pay the assessments if it 
     
 
has not been applied to other fines or fees.

What do I do after I fill out the Application for Waiver 
 
of Criminal and/or Traffic Court Assessments For 
 
Use in Cook County Only and Order for Waiver of 
 
 
Criminal and/or Traffic Court Assessments For Use

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
