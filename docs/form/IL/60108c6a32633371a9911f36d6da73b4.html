Why do I need copies of my criminal records? 
Criminal records list the offenses you were arrested for,

criminal records will be considered by the court in 
evaluating your Request for Certificate of Good Conduct.

about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 

What is a Certificate of Good Conduct? 
A Certificate of Good Conduct is a court order stating 
that an individual has been rehabilitated from past 
criminal conduct. 

Why would someone seek a Certificate of Good 
Conduct? 
A Certificate of Good Conduct may help you overcome 
barriers that your criminal record is causing (such as 
difficulties with getting a job or finding housing). It may 
also remove barriers to employment under Illinois laws. 
Go to this website for a list of barriers to employment in 
Illinois: https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/. 

Who can ask the court for a Certificate of Good 
Conduct? 
You can ask for a Certificate so long as you have not 
been convicted of any of the following: 
o  Aggravated driving under the influence 
o  Aggravated domestic battery 
o  Arson, aggravated arson 
o  Kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping 
o  Convictions resulting in registration under (1) Sex 
Offender Registration Act, (2) Arsonist Registration 
Act, or (3) Murder and Violent Offender Against 
Youth Registration Act 

o  Federal or out of state convictions unless you are 

removing a specific legal restriction, for example, the 
Illinois School Code bars you from working with that 
conviction in schools 

o  Certificate of Good Conduct cannot be issued for the 

Juvenile cases 

following types of cases: 
• 
•  Civil cases 
•  Minor traffic offenses 

     

When Can I Apply? 
If you were convicted of a misdemeanor, you must wait 
at least 1 year after your sentence ended. If you were 
convicted of a felony, you must wait at least 2 years after 
your sentence ended. Your sentence ends on the date of 
the payment of any fine imposed or on the date of 
release from custody by parole, mandatory supervised 
release, or commutation or termination of sentence. 730 
ILCS 5/5-5.5-30(c).

required, it is the best available source for your 
statewide criminal record. Please note, there might be 
discrepancies or missing information.  You can get a 
"Statewide Criminal History Transcript" in 3 ways: 
•  Directly from the Illinois State Police: 
 

Illinois State Police, Bureau of Identification 
260 North Chicago Street, Joliet, Illinois 60432 
(815) 740-5160 
https://isp.illinois.gov/BureauOfIdentification/Crim 
inalHistory 

•  Every law enforcement agency is allowed to 
 
provide you this information. Check with your 
local law enforcement agency to find out costs 
and times for fingerprinting. 

•  You can also go to any licensed LiveScan 
 

vendor to get your Transcript. Find a LiveScan 
vendor at: 
idfpr.com/LicenseLookUp/fingerprintlist.asp. 
o  Get information from the Circuit Clerk. Many court 
records are available online. Other counties, like 
Cook County, do not provide online access to 
criminal records. In this case, go to the Circuit Clerk’s 
Office in the county where your case was filed. Ask 
the Circuit Clerk for copies of your court dispositions 
or use the public computer at the courthouse to look 
them up and print them out. There may be a fee to 
print out your court dispositions, but you can look at 
them on the computer and write down the information 
for free. Find your Circuit Clerk's website at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/. 

o  Get information from the Chicago Police

Department. Order a RAP sheet from the Chicago 
Police Department if you were arrested in Chicago. 
There may be a waiting period before you get your 
RAP sheet. There will be a fee. 
o  You must go to the Chicago Police Department 

to get your Chicago RAP sheet: 
Chicago Police Headquarters 
3510 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 
(312) 745-5508 

o  You should also request a copy of your Illinois 
State Police Statewide Criminal History 
Transcript.  The Chicago Police will provide your 
state record for no additional cost. 

o  If you are requesting a Certificate for an out of 
state or federal conviction because you need to 
remove a specific legal restriction (for example, you 
have a conviction in Iowa that legally bars you from 
working as a teacher in Illinois), you must get your 
certified court disposition or a similar document from 
the state where you were convicted. If you were 
convicted of a federal crime after November 1, 2004, 
you can get your case information from 
www.Pacer.gov. Otherwise, you will need to get the 
information from the federal courthouse where you 
were convicted. You will be charged a fee to access 
your case information. 

What if I previously sealed the conviction for which I 
am requesting a Certificate? 
o  Sealing a conviction restricts the court from 

accessing the sealed case. If you previously sealed 
a conviction and you wish to request a Certificate for 
the sealed conviction, then you may need to file a 
motion with your request for a Certificate in order for 
the court to consider your request. The motion may 
be called a “Motion to Unseal and Reseal case” or 
“Motion to Access Court File.” This motion will not 
make your conviction public. Contact the Circuit 
Clerk for more information on filing such a Motion. 
You may be charged a fee for filing this motion.

 Line 8b: In 8b, check this box if there are legal 
employment barriers preventing you from working. You

o  Go to this website for a list of barriers to employment 

in Illinois: https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/ 

SECTION 9: Check this box if you are seeking a 
Certificate of Good Conduct for housing purposes. If you 
have been denied housing due to your criminal record, it 
is important for the court to know specific examples 
where you have been denied housing. Helpful 
information can include the approximate date of denial, 
location/name of building, and how it affected you. 
o  For instance, “In April 2020, I applied for housing 
with Meadow Oak Apartments in Chicago, and the 
manager told me they could not allow me to live 
there due to my criminal record. This apartment was 
in a good neighborhood and was affordable for my 
family, but we were forced to move into my sister’s 
home instead.” 

o  Attach any documentation of your housing denial, 
which can include: a letter from the landlord or 

management company that denied you housing and 
the background check that showed your conviction. 

What type of documents should I include to support 
my Request for Certificate of Good Conduct? 
When you file your Request, the only thing the judge 
knows about you is your criminal history. It is important 
to include documents with other information about 
yourself, which you can attach to your Request. 
Examples include: 
o  Your criminal history (exhibit could be RAP sheet or 

case dispositions, etc.) 

o  Your educational progress (exhibits could be 

transcript, degrees, letters from teachers/professors, 
etc.) 

o  Your work history (exhibits could be resume, letter 
from current, former, or potential employer, etc.) 
o  If drug dependency was an issue, your treatment 
progress (exhibit could be 12-step program, 
treatment completion, letter from sponsor, 
counselor, etc.) 

o  If mental health was an issue, your treatment 

progress (exhibit could be letter from therapist, 
background on seeking treatment, etc.) 

o  Your family situation (exhibits could be letter from 

family, who you are supporting, who you are helping 
in their family, etc.) 

o  Your community involvement (exhibits could be 
letters from volunteer groups, certificates of 
appreciation, etc.) 

o  Anything else that is relevant to support your claim 

of rehabilitation. 

What type of letters should I include? 
It is important for the judge to be able to consider the 
opinions of people who know you. Asking people to write 
letters on your behalf is one way for the judge to do this. 
There are several different types of letters you can 
attach to your Request. 
General Character Letter 
o  A general character letter should include: 1) how the 
writer knows you; 2) how long they have known you; 
3) if they are aware of your criminal record; 4) what 
they have to say about your good character (for 
example, honest, peaceful, kind, trustworthy, 
hardworking, etc.); and 5) examples that show your 
good character.  If the writer is a family member you 
are supporting, make sure they include that fact in 
the letter. 

Potential Employer Letter: 
o  Include letters from employers if they say you will not 
be offered a job because of your criminal record. 

Addiction or Mental Health Treatment Letter: 
o  Letters to demonstrate treatment by a doctor, 
therapist, counselor, or treatment center could 
include: 1) an official diagnosis of your condition; 2) 
dates of current or past treatment; 3) whether you 
received inpatient or outpatient treatment; 4) if you

take medication as part of your treatment; and 5) 
any other information that may be relevant to your 
treatment. 

NOTE:  this letter will be available to the public and filing 
it with the court may waive your right to confidentiality of 
your mental health records. 
o  If you go to Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous or 
similar group meetings, try to get a letter from a 
sponsor or group leader. Ask them to include in the 
letter: 1) how long you have been going to meetings; 
2) how often you attend meetings; and 3) the 
progress that you have made in your recovery. 

Current or Former Employer Letter: 
o  Letters verifying your employment should include: 1) 
how long you worked there; 2) your job title and any 
promotions earned; 3) why you are a good 
employee; and if true, 4) whether a Certificate of 
Good Conduct can help you earn a promotion, more 
hours or full-time employment. 

o  SECTION 8: Check this box if you are seeking a 
Certificate of Good Conduct for employment or 
licensing purposes. 

NOTE: If possible, all letters should be typed on a 
computer, printed, and signed by the writer.

STEP 3: NEXT STEPS 

What do I do after I fill out my forms? 

Step 1- File your Request for Certificate of Good 
Conduct with the Circuit Clerk in the county where
you were convicted. 
o  You may be able to file in person, by mail, or by e-
filing (filing electronically). Check with your Circuit 

Clerk to see how to file in your county. 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/. 

o  There may be a fee to file your Request for 

Certificate of Good Conduct. The Circuit Clerk can 
let you know the amount of the fee. Ask the Circuit 
Clerk and ask how much it will cost to file your forms 
and the types of payment (cash, check, credit, 
online) they take. 

o  If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
the court to pay for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
an Application for Waiver of Court Fees which you 
can find at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms/. 

How to File in Person 
o  Go to the courthouse in the county where your court 

case should be filed. 

o  Bring 4 copies of the Notice of Court Date, the 

Request for Certificate of Good Conduct, and all 
documents you have attached to your Request with 
you to the Circuit Clerk's office. 

o  Give the Circuit Clerk your original form and the 

copies to stamp. 

o  The Circuit Clerk will stamp your forms keep the 

original forms and give back your copies. This stamp 
is your proof that the forms were filed with the court. 
o  Pay the filing fee or file your Application for Waiver 

of Court Fees. 

How to File by Mail 
o  If you are asking to file for free or at a reduced cost, 
there may be local rules requiring you to file your 
Application for Waiver of Court Fees and your 
Request for Certificate of Good Conduct in person. 
Ask the Circuit Clerk if you need to file in person. 
o  In Cook County, you must go in person to have your 

fees waived. 

o  If you do not need to appear in person, mail your 

original form including your Request for Certificate of 
Good Conduct and one copy to the Circuit Clerk to 
stamp. 

o  If you do not need to have your fees waived, mail in 
4 copies of the Notice of Court Date, the Request for 
Certificate of Good Conduct, all documents you 
have attached to your Request to the Circuit Clerk's 
office, and the correct fee. 

o  Include a self-addressed and stamped envelope for 
the Circuit Clerk to mail the file stamped copy to you. 

How to electronically file (E-file) 
o  In counties that accept e-filing for criminal matters 
(you can go to efile.illinoiscourts.gov/active-
courts.htm to see if your court accepts criminal e-
filings) you may electronically file (e-file) the Request 
for Certificate of Good Conduct with the trial court. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

provider.

Circuit Clerk to the State's Attorney. There are 
instructions on the Notice explaining how to 
complete the form. 

o  If you and the person you're sending the (form) to 

have an email address, you must send it by email or 
by notification through the e-filing system. If you or 
the person you’re sending the (form) to does not 
have an email address, you may give it to the other 
parties by personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 
o  You may e-mail your form to a party if they have 

listed their e-mail address on a court 
document. Complete the Proof of Delivery with 
information to show how you sent the forms to each 
party. The form has room for 3 parties. If you are 
sending forms to more than 3 parties, fill out and file 
one or more Additional Proof of Delivery forms with 
your form. 

Step 4: Mail a copy of your Request for Certificate of 
Good Conduct to the judge. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk which judge is going to hear 
your case and mail them a copy of your Request. 
Address your envelope to the judge at the 
courthouse address. 

o  Giving the judge a copy will give them an opportunity 
to review your Request ahead of your court date and 
resume, degrees or certificates, letters from 
teachers or past employers). 

o  Gather and make copies of pictures and documents 
you want the judge to see. Bring the original for the 
judge and one copy for you and each of the people 
in the case. If your court date is by phone or video, 
contact the Circuit Clerk and ask how you can get a 
copy of these items to the judge. You might have to 
e-file them like your other documents. You will also 
have to get a copy of these items to the other 
parties. 

o  If you want the judge to hear from other people, 
those people will have to attend court and be 
witnesses (in most cases, you cannot bring in written 
statements of witnesses). If your court date is by 
phone or video, you will have to arrange for your 
witnesses to attend by phone or video. 

Step 5: Get ready for your court date. 
o  Review your Request filed with the court. Remember 
that you have sworn that everything in this document 
is true. Be familiar with your criminal record and any 
documents you attached to your Request so you can 
talk about your background and how you have been 
rehabilitated. If there are documents that you did not 
attach to your Request that you want the judge to 
look at, bring copies with you. 

o  A character witness can testify to your rehabilitation. 
This can be a family member, friend, co-worker, or 
community member. 

o  Prepare questions for witnesses, if any.  Questions 

can include the following: 
 
•  Who is the person? 

•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/how-
to-e-file/ 

o  If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
terminal to e-file your forms. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on a 

flash drive. 

   

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 

that you can use to e-file your form. 

o  If your court requires that all Request for Certificate 
of Good Conduct be e-filed, you are exempt from e-
filing if (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
available. 

 
• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

 
•  File the original and 4 copies of your forms and 
the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
in person or by mail. 

Step 2: Ask for a court date. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically. 
o  If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 

Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
with other court staff. 

o  When you get your court date, ask if the court will 
send notice of the court date to the other party or if 
you need to. 

o  If you need to send notice, complete the Notice of 
Court Date for Request for Certificate of Good 
Conduct. 

Step 3: Send a copy of your Request for Certificate 
of Good Conduct to the State's Attorney. 
o  After filing and after you receive a court date, you 
must complete and send a copy of your Notice of 
Court Date for Request for Certificate of Good 
Conduct along with the forms you filed with the 

GC-I 2402.3

•  The judge may allow the character witness to 
give a presentation or may require you to ask 
the witness questions.  Ask the questions you 
prepared in advance. 

•  The judge and the State's Attorney may also 
 

ask questions of your witnesses. 

•  Tell the judge the name of your character 

witnesses. 

   

o  When you are finished, the State’s Attorney will be 

given an opportunity to speak. Listen politely and do 
not interrupt. 

o  The judge will decide whether the documents, 
witness testimony, and other evidence can be 
considered in making a decision about your case. 

Step 8: The judge makes a decision after both sides 
present their case. 
o  The judge will then issue a ruling on your Request. 
The Request will either be “granted” or “denied.” 
o  If the Request is “granted,” that means the court will 
issue the Certificate of Good Conduct.  If the 
Request is “denied,” that means the court will not 
issue a Certificate of Good Conduct. 

Step 9: What do I do if my Certificate is granted? 
o  The Court will enter a written order.  This order is 
your Certificate of Good Conduct.  No separate 
certificate will be issued.  NOTE: Be sure to ask for 
a copy of the Certificate and do not leave the 
courthouse without it. 

o  Get a certified copy of your Certificate. 

•  The court clerk should provide you with a copy 
 
of your Certificate shortly after the judge’s 
decision.  Go to the Circuit Clerk’s office and 
have them certify, either by stamp or raised 
seal, the Certificate (a small fee may apply). 
o  Make sure that the Illinois State Police receive a 

copy of your Certificate. 

o  Tell the judge what you do in your community 

(volunteer, part of your family, include letters from 
family, church or other organizations). 

o  If you want the Certificate because of a specific 

Make sure you know how you are 
to attend your court date. 
Your court date could be in person, by phone 
or by video. If it is by phone or video it is 
called a “Remote Appearance.” Call the 
Circuit Clerk or visit their website for more 
information. To find the phone number for 
your Circuit Clerk, visit

employment barrier, explain how you are qualified 
for the job but cannot get it because of your 
convictions (for example, you have training or have 
worked in that field). If you have 
already been denied a job 
because of your record, tell the 
judge. 
oGive copies of any documents 
you brought to court that are not 
attached to your Request to the 
judge and the State’s Attorney. 
Be prepared to explain why a 
document is important. 
oIf you have any character 
witnesses, bring them to court.

•  How they have seen changes in you since your

rehabilitated? 

Step 6: Go to your court date. 
o  You should have received a 
court date and time from the 
Circuit Clerk when you filed 
your court forms OR on a 
written notice from the Circuit 
Clerk. If you cannot find your 
court date and time, call the 
Circuit Clerk. 
• 
 

If your court date is by 
phone or video: 
 Make sure to have 

the call-in or login information for your court 
date and make sure your technology is 
working. 
Follow the instructions on the court notice 
you received. Call the Circuit Clerk or Circuit 
Court or visit their websites for specific 
technology instructions. 
Follow these recommendations to appear by 
phone or video: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
help/court-by-phone-or-video/. 





o  Bring these items with you to court: 

•  A photo I.D.; 
•  Copies of all the documents you filed with the 

Circuit Clerk; 

•  Any documents you did not include in your 

Request that you want the judge to look at; AND 

•  A copy of the Order. 

o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 

form. If your forms do not have a courtroom number 
look for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the 
Circuit Clerk. 

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 

name and case number to be called. 

o  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 

introduce yourself. If you are attending by phone or 
video, remember to unmute yourself. 

Step 7: How do I present my case to the judge? 
o  Tell the judge your side of the case and answer 

questions. 

o  Focus on the 3 or 4 strongest arguments in your 
favor.  The judge will have read your Request so 
you do not need to repeat everything in it. 
o  Even though the judge may ask you about your 

convictions, the judge is not deciding whether you 
should have been convicted.

•  The Circuit Clerk’s office will send a copy of 
 
your Certificate to the Illinois State Police for 
verification purposes.  Thirty days after the 
judge signed your Certificate, you can call the 
Illinois State Police at (815) 740-5160 to confirm 
they received the Certificate. 
o  Keep a copy of your Certificate. 

• 
 

 
• 

If an employment background check asks if you 
have earned a Certificate of Good Conduct, you 
can answer “yes.”  Your employer may be 
legally required to retain a copy of your 
Certificate, so be prepared to present the 
Certificate when asked to do so. 

If you apply for a job and a background check 
discloses a conviction for which you have 
received a Certificate of Good Conduct, give 
the employer a copy of your Certificate. 

Step 10: What do I do if my Certificate is denied? 
o  Ask the judge to reconsider. 

 
•  You can file a Motion to Reconsider the denial. 
You have 30 days from the day the order 
denying your Request is signed to file the 
Motion.  If you file a Motion to Reconsider, you 
must explain how the denial was wrong 

because the judge made a mistake in applying 
the law to your evidence or used the wrong law 
to decide your case. 

o  Preserve your right to request a Certificate in the 

future. 
 
• 

If the judge denies your Request, ask the judge 
to do so “without prejudice.” If the judge does 
this, you can make a request for a Certificate in 
the future. For example, if the judge denies your 
request because it has not been long enough 
since the end of your sentence or the judge was 
not convinced you have been rehabilitated, you 
could file again when enough time has passed 
since your last sentence or when you have 
more evidence of rehabilitation. 

 
•  You have the right to appeal the denial of your 

Request.  Because judges have a lot of 
discretion to grant or deny a Certificate of Good 
Conduct, it is unlikely that an appeal would be 
successful.

Appendix: Case Worksheet 

Use this worksheet to get the information from your 
entire criminal record in one place. 
o  You can find all the information you need to fill in the 

worksheet on your court dispositions, RAP sheets, and 
information from the Illinois State Police Access and 
Review process. Below are some samples to help you 
locate the information you need. 

o  There are three tables on page 10 of this instruction 
booklet to help you determine if a sentence or 
disposition qualifies as a conviction for the purposes of 
a Certificate of Good Conduct. 

How do I complete the Case Worksheet? 
Using the information on your court dispositions and any 
RAP sheets you have, fill in your Case Worksheet with 
this information for each case: 
o Arrest or Case Number: Enter the arrest or case 

number listed on your court disposition or RAP sheet. 

o Arresting Agency: Enter the name of the police 

department that arrested you. 

o Charge: Enter all offenses you were charged with for 

each case number, for example “drug possession” and 
“possession of paraphernalia.” 

o Date of Arrest: Enter the date you were arrested that is 

listed on your court disposition or RAP sheet. 
o Outcome: enter the sentence you received for the 

offense. 

o Completion of Sentence: Enter the date your sentence 

ended successfully. 

What if I see an arrest on my criminal record but there
is no charge, disposition or sentence listed? 
Not all arrests lead to charges, so there would not be a 
charge, disposition, or sentence listed on your record. All 
arrests without charges can be expunged if all the 
offenses on your entire record qualify. If not, then the 
arrests can be sealed. In the chart below, you only need to 
enter the Arresting Agency and Date of Arrest for arrests 
that did not result in charges.

How do I know if I was “convicted” of an offense? 
The disposition (outcome) of the offense on your record 
tells you if you were convicted or not. The tables below 
explain what the disposition codes or descriptions on your

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
