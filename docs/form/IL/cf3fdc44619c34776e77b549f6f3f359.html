o  Notice of Court Date for Motion: use this form to 

 

 

schedule the court date when you will see the judge. 
This form also: 
 

 
• 

 
• 

 
• 

lists the date, time, and place where you will see 
the judge; 
 

lists the names and addresses of the other 
 
parties or the names and addresses of their 
lawyers; AND

hearing date. 
 

 

Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms. 
 
 
Are there any costs to file a Motion to Continue or 
Extend Time? 
 
o  No. 
 
   
o 
 

If you have not yet filed your Appearance in the 
case, there may be a fee for filing your Appearance. 
 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
the court to file for free. You will have to apply for a 
fee waiver by filling out the Application for Waiver of 
 
Court Fees. This is a separate set of forms you can 
find at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What do I do after I fill out my forms? 
 
Step 1- File your Motion to Continue or Extend Time 
 
with the Circuit Clerk in the county where the court 
case is filed. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  

   

 

 

 

 

•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
available. 
  

 

 
• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms.

Who can use a Motion to Continue or Extend Time? 
 
Anyone who needs to ask the court to continue 
(reschedule) a court date that has already been 
scheduled, or who needs more time to do something 
 
(like file an Answer or respond to a Motion another party 
has filed) can file a Motion to Continue or Extend Time. 
 
 
Does the judge have to grant my Motion to Continue 
or Extend Time? 
 
o  No. The judge is not required to grant your Motion. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Usually, the judge will make a decision by looking at 
the reason why you need a continuance or more 
 
time.  In some cases, the judge may be required to 
consider specific factors. 
 
 

 

Is there a deadline for filing a Motion to Continue or 
Extend Time? 
 
o  No, but if you are asking the court to continue 

 

(reschedule) a court date, you must file your Motion 
 
as far before that court date as possible. If you are 
asking the court to extend your time to do 
something, you should file your Motion as far before 
that deadline as possible. 
 

 

 

 

 

o  There may be more specific deadlines depending on 
the type of court date you are asking the court to 
reschedule. 
 

 

 
What forms do I need to fill out to file a Motion to 
Continue or Extend Time? 
 
o  Motion to Continue or Extend Time: use this form 
to explain why you need to continue (reschedule) a 
court date or why you need more time to do 
something. The email address (if you have one) and 
mailing address you put on the Motion to Continue 
or Extend Time is where important legal documents 
will be sent to you. You should use an email account 
that you do not share with anyone else and that you 
check every day. If you do not check your email 
every day, you may miss important information, 
notice of court dates, or documents from other 
 
parties. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

o  Order Granting/Denying Motion to Continue or 

 

 

Extend Time: is used by the judge to say if your 
Motion to Continue or Extend Time is granted or 
denied.

Step 2: The other party presents their position on 
 
your Motion. 
 
o  The other party will also get to present their position 
 

 

 

on your Motion by testifying, giving the judge 
evidence, and questioning witnesses. 
 

 

o  You will get to see any documents and photos the 

 

 

other party brings to court. If you do not think the 
judge should consider them in making a decision 
about your Motion, tell the judge why. 
 
o  You may ask questions of the other party’s 
 

 

 

 

witnesses. Write down your questions while they are 
 
speaking to the other party or judge. 
 
 

 

 

Step 3: The judge makes a decision after both sides 
present their positions. 
 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 

 

o 
 

o 
 

o 
 

 

called a court Order. 
 
If the judge needs more information to make a 
decision, the judge may set up another court date. 
 
Make sure you understand what information is 
needed and get it before the new court date. 
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge 
 
may let you know the decision later by mailing a 
court Order or at another court date. 
If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
decide right then and fill out a court Order. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

•  Get a file-stamped copy of the Order. 
 
 

If the other party was not in court to get a copy, you must 
send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the date you get the 
Order. Fill out and file a Proof of Delivery court form with 
the Circuit Clerk to show that you sent the copy. You 
may find the Proof of Delivery at: 
 
  
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-forms.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
