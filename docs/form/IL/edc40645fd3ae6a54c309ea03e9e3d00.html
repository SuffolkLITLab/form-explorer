ORIGINS AND PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT 

1

This report builds on the June 1, 2016, findings and recommendations of the Illinois 
Statutory Court Fee Task Force (the “2016 Report”) , as well as legislation enacted by the 
Illinois General Assembly and court rules promulgated by the Illinois Supreme Court in 
response to the 2016 Report.  Contained in Public Act 100-987, the legislation included 
the Criminal and Traffic Assessment Act (“CTAA,” 705 ILCS 135/) addressing court fees 
and costs (“assessments”) in criminal and traffic proceedings, and Section 27.1b of the 
Clerk of Courts Act (“Section 27.1b,” 705 ILCS 105/27.1b) governing assessments in civil 
litigation.  The legislation streamlined and simplified the imposition of assessments, made 
the imposition of assessments more uniform across the state, and together with Supreme 
Court Rule amendments expanded the availability of assessment waivers for low-income 
parties.  

The General Assembly anticipated that, as with any massive statutory overhaul, 
P.A. 100-987 (the “Legislation”) would produce some implementation issues, inconsistent 
interpretations, and unintended consequences.  Consequently, the Legislation included a 
sunset date—currently January 1, 2024—to ensure that any such issues would be 
identified and addressed.  The Illinois Supreme Court responded to the impending sunset 
by issuing an order on January 11, 2021, creating a new Task Force to propose measures to 
remedy any problems that had surfaced regarding the Legislation, and to develop 
proposals to further improve the manner in which assessments are imposed in Illinois 
courts.  2

Like the original Task Force, the members of the new Task Force include judges, 
legislators from both parties, court clerks, representatives appointed by the Governor, 
and lawyers appointed by the Supreme Court.  Most of the Task Force’s initial work was 
performed by three committees: (1) an Implementation Committee charged with 
identifying, and proposing measures to remedy, problems that have arisen with the 
operation of the Legislation; (2) a New Initiatives Committee responsible for developing 
proposals aimed at problems that the original Task Force had not targeted; and (3) a Data

Collection and Analysis Committee tasked with providing data required to inform the 
work of the other committees, as well as developing recommendations for improving the 
collection of information needed to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of previous proposals and 
to provide an informed basis for additional proposals. 

The structure of this report parallels the work of the Task Force’s three committees.  
Following an Executive Summary, Section I of the Recommendations discusses the 
measures developed by the Implementation Committee for addressing issues that have 
arisen under the Legislation.  Section II discusses proposals developed by the New 
Initiatives Committee for further improving the manner in which assessments are 
imposed in Illinois courts.  Finally, Section III discusses measures that will improve the 
data collected regarding assessments and thereby improve our ability to measure the 
eﬀectiveness of the current system and identify additional needed reforms. 

The Task Force developed these recommendations with the assistance of input from two 
public hearings.  The first hearing was conducted by Zoom videoconference on July 13, 
2021.  Testimony from that hearing helped focus and guide the Task Force’s work.  The 
second public hearing was held by Zoom videoconference on August 30, 2022, for the 
purpose of obtaining public comments on the recommendations contained in a draft of 
this report.  Feedback from both hearings, as well as written comments on the draft 
report, has been considered by the Task Force and reflected in this final report where 
appropriate.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The Task Force’s Implementation, New Initiatives, and Data Collection and Reporting 
Committees developed recommendations for the subjects within their respective areas of 
responsibility. The committees’ recommendations were then reviewed by the Task Force 
as a whole, which also considered input from two public hearings before approving the 
following final Task Force recommendations:  

Implementation Recommendations 
1. The General Assembly should eliminate the sunset provisions in the CTAA and Section

27.1b. This is needed because the CTAA has largely succeeded in its purpose of
simplifying the imposition of assessments, slowing the increase in assessments,
reducing variations in the amount imposed, and reducing the impact on low- and
moderate-income residents. Appendix A to this Report contains proposed legislation
that would implement this recommendation.

2. The General Assembly should revise and clarify certain definitions in the CTAA (705
ILCS 135/1-5).  The recommended revisions will clarify that “case” includes all
proceedings arising out of a single occurrence, that an assessment paid directly to
the court is waivable, and that an assessment paid to a third-party is waivable if the
third-party provided services pursuant to a contract with the court. This is needed to
eliminate confusion about what is waivable under the current definition of “case,” and
to increase the consistency in the application of waiver rules. Appendices B and C
contain proposed legislation that would implement this recommendation.

3. The General Assembly should revise 725 ILCS 5/124A-20 to prohibit plea agreements
which are conditioned upon the defendant giving up the right to seek an assessment
waiver. This is needed because of the practice that has developed in some
jurisdictions of requiring defendants to bargain away their right to an assessment
waiver, which (a) saddles defendants with debt they cannot aﬀord to pay, (b) increases
the variation, from county to county, in terms of the availability of assessment waivers,
and (c) defeats the purpose of allowing such waivers. Appendix D contains proposed
legislation implementing this recommendation.

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

4. Supreme Court Rules 298 and 404 should be amended to establish a uniform

procedure governing assessment waivers that limits when a hearing can be conducted
in civil cases and prevents the decision on an application for assessment waiver in a
criminal case from being deferred until the defendant completes his or her sentence.
These changes are needed to (a) reduce inconsistency in the decisions on assessment
waiver applications for similarly situated applicants, and (b) reduce the potential for
implicit bias, which is increased with a hearing, to impact the decision whether to
grant a waiver.  Appendix E contains proposed revisions to Supreme Court Rules 298
and 404 to implement this recommendation.

5. The General Assembly should fully incorporate all assessments into either the CTAA or
Section 27.1b.  The Task Force identified assessment statutes that were overlooked in
the original Legislation.  Moving those provisions into either the CTAA (criminal
assessments) or Clerk of Courts Act (civil assessments)—or possibly eliminating some
of those assessments—is needed to avoid confusion regarding the continuing
existence of these outlier assessments and to further the original purpose of the CTAA
to make imposition of assessments simpler and more transparent.  Appendix F
includes a complete list of all outlier civil and criminal add-on assessments.  The Task
Force takes no position on whether particular assessments should be eliminated, but
Appendix F contains suggestions regarding where, if they are not eliminated, the
outlier assessments should be included in either the CTAA or Clerk of Courts Act.

6. The General Assembly, the judiciary, counties, circuit court clerks, and the bar should
continue to work cooperatively to ensure that the judicial system receives sufficient
funding to enable it to remain capable of eﬀectively serving the public.  While the need
for adequate funding of the judicial system is self-evident, this recommendation
recognizes the important role that each of the identified stakeholders plays in
ensuring that this objective continues to be achieved.

7. The flexibility which the CTAA provides counties regarding how much funding to

provide organizations authorized to receive assessment revenue should be preserved.
This is needed because (a) the CTAA was intended to give counties discretion to
decide, in light of local conditions, the extent (if at all) to which certain nonprofit
organizations should receive funding from assessments, and (b) that flexibility
promotes accountability and efficiency in disbursing funds.

8. Vigilance by interested stakeholders is required to prevent future legislation from 
weakening the reforms contained in the CTAA and Section 27.1b.  The General 
Assembly, the Supreme Court, the AOIC, circuit clerks, and bar associations each bear 
responsibility for ensuring that future legislation does not erode the gains achieved by 
the CTAA and Section 27.1b.  In particular:  (a) future legislation amending the CTAA 
and Section 27.1b should include findings that explain the history and purpose of 
those statutes in order to discourage the creation of new assessments outside of the 
current system; (b) future legislation that increases or creates a new assessment 
should include a finding explaining how the assessment either defrays the net cost of 
the litigation or directly relates to the administration of the court system; and (c) the 
Supreme Court, circuit clerks, and bar associations should vigilantly monitor 
proposed legislation that would add an assessment and strive to ensure that, if 
enacted, any new assessments are placed in the CTAA or Section 27.1b and adhere to 
the overall caps on the amount of assessments contained in that legislation.  

Recommended New Initiatives  
1. The General Assembly should abolish assessments and fines in juvenile delinquency 
cases.  Assessments and fines in juvenile delinquency cases undermine the goal of 
achieving rehabilitation and successful reentry into the community by leaving youths 
with significant debt, prolonging their involvement in the justice system, and 
increasing the likelihood of recidivism.  

2. The General Assembly should eliminate the annual fee in guardianship cases for minors 

and disabled adults from the Clerk of Courts Act.  This is needed because most 
guardians are family members and are self-represented and the revenue impact would 
be small.  Appendix G contains proposed legislation implementing this 
recommendation. 

3. The General Assembly should eliminate redundant legislation authorizing debt 

collection charges regarding unpaid assessments.  There are currently four diﬀerent 
statutes authorizing the imposition of a fee in connection with eﬀorts by circuit clerks 
to collect unpaid assessments.  Elimination of two of those statutes is needed 
because they are redundant to the other collection fees, unnecessarily add to the 
debtor’s burden, and are not currently assessed by all circuit clerks.  Appendix H 
contains proposed legislation implementing this recommendation. 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

4. The General Assembly should allow defendants sentenced to the Department of 

Corrections to earn a reduction in the amount of assessments (i.e., court costs and 
fees) and fines, but not restitution, unless the States Attorney requests and obtains an 
order excluding the reduction from the sentence based on the defendant’s ability to 
pay.  The recommended legislation would reduce the amount of assessments and 
fines 20% for each year of a sentence, with defendants sentenced to a term of five or 
more years earning a 100% reduction.  This is needed to (a) reduce barriers to 
defendants’ successful reentry into society, and (b) relieve court officials of the 
administrative burden and expense of tracking debt that is usually uncollectable.  
Appendix I contains proposed legislation implementing this recommendation. 

5. Legislation applying to civil cases the more generous financial criteria for full or partial 
assessment waivers that currently apply to criminal cases should be enacted once the 
financial impact of that change is ascertained and adequate replacement funding for 
lost revenues is identified.  This is needed because assessments continue to present a 
significant barrier to access to justice in civil cases and it is difficult, from a policy 
rather than a budgetary perspective, to justify having diﬀerent guidelines for civil and 
criminal proceedings. 

6. The General Assembly should convene a legislative working group to review a list of 
potentially problematic assessments in civil cases to ensure compliance with Illinois 
Supreme Court decisions which prohibit, as unlawful litigation taxes, fees that do not 
defray the expenses of litigation and therefore violate the free access and due process 
clauses of the Illinois Constitution.  This is needed because some of the fees listed in 
Appendix F that were inadvertently omitted from the CTAA and Section 27.1b may not 
be sufficiently tied to expenses of litigation to withstand constitutional scrutiny. 

7.

Interested stakeholders should develop a long-term plan for achieving a unified Illinois 
court system that further reduces (or eliminates entirely) the use of assessments as a 
source of revenue.  This is needed because all Illinois citizens benefit from the justice 
system and a fully taxpayer-funded court system would allocate the costs of the state 
court system across all taxpayers rather than only those utilizing the system to resolve 
a dispute.

Data Collection and Reporting Recommendations 
1. The General Assembly should revise Section 1-10 of the CTAA to require the 

continuation and expansion of reports by circuit court clerks regarding assessments in 
criminal and traffic proceedings.  The CTAA did not require the filing of assessment 
reports after 2019, although reports were filed for 2020 and 2021 pursuant to 
Supreme Court order.  Requiring biannual assessment reports, and adding the 
number of assessment waiver applications to the data that had been required by the 
CTAA, is needed to analyze the functioning of the current system for the imposition, 
collection, and waiver of assessments and fines in criminal and traffic cases, and to 
identify areas for future reforms.  Appendix J contains proposed legislation 
implementing this recommendation. 

2. The General Assembly should revise Section 27.1d of the Clerk of Courts Act to expand 
reports by circuit court clerks regarding assessments in civil cases. Requiring biannual 
assessment reports, and adding the number of cases in which assessment waiver 
applications are filed to the data that is currently required, is needed to evaluate the 
imposition, collection and waiver of assessments in civil cases, and to identify areas 
for future reforms.  Appendix K contains proposed legislation implementing this 
recommendation. 

3. The Supreme Court should direct the AOIC’s Judicial Management Information 

Services division to continue to work with the circuit clerks on improving the data 
reported to the AOIC regarding the collection of assessments and fines.  This is needed 
to improve our ability to identify the impact of the CTAA and Section 27.1b, as well as 
the projected impact of future proposed legislation relating to assessments.

ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

I.

Issues Regarding Implementation of the Criminal and Traffic 
Assessment Act and Section 27.1b of the Clerk of Courts Act  

The Implementation Committee obtained feedback on the operation of the Legislation 
from judges, lawyers, circuit clerks, and other justice partners.  The Committee evaluated 
the eﬀectiveness of the Legislation by reference to the extent to which it has addressed 
the following key findings contained in the 2016 Report : 3

(1)  The nature and purpose of assessments have changed over time, leading to a 
byzantine system that attempts to pass an increased share of the cost of court 
administration onto the parties to court proceedings;  

(2)  Court fines and fees are constantly increasing and are outpacing inflation;  

(3)  There is excessive variation across the state in the amount of assessments for 
the same type of proceedings; and  

(4)  The cumulative impact of the assessments imposed on parties to civil lawsuits 
and defendants in criminal and traffic proceedings imposes severe and 
disproportionate impacts on low- and moderate-income Illinois residents. 

The Implementation Committee concluded that the Legislation had been successful in 
simplifying the manner in which assessments are imposed in civil, criminal, and traffic 
proceedings, slowing the increase in assessment amounts, reducing intra-state variation 
in the amount of assessments imposed for the same type of proceedings, and reducing 
the impacts of assessments on low- and moderate-income residents.  However, the 
Committee identified areas where additional legislation is needed to cure ambiguous 
language in the original Legislation or correct statutory interpretations that were 
inconsistent with the legislative intent.  The Task Force as a whole subsequently reviewed 
and refined the Implementation Committee’s recommendations.  The following

discussion addresses nine implementation issues, explains why they are important, and 
where needed presents a proposed remedy in the form of legislation or Supreme Court 
Rule. 

Implementation Issue 1:  The CTAA and Section 27.1b Are Scheduled to Sunset  
                                                          on January 1, 2024 
Why is this an issue? 

     

Sunset provisions would repeal the CTAA and Section 27.1b on January 1, 2024.  Due to 
the way the sunset provisions were drafted, the statutory framework for collection of 
assessments would not revert to the prior system if the Legislation is allowed to sunset.  
The prior statutory framework has been repealed in its entirety.  Therefore, if the 
Legislation sunsets, no statutory authorization for the collection of assessments in civil, 
criminal, or traffic proceedings would exist in Illinois at all. 

The sweeping reforms contained in the Legislation were intended to address systemic 
problems identified in the 2016 Report.  Litigants bore the brunt of most of those 
problems, including a proliferation of court assessments that interfered with access to 
justice in civil cases, created excessive variation across the state in assessments levied in 
the same kind of cases, and imposed undue financial burdens on defendants in criminal 
and traffic cases.  The sunset provisions in the Legislation have added urgency to the 
need to evaluate the extent to which the Legislation has achieved its ambitious 
objectives, especially those pertaining to the impact of assessments on litigants, and to 
identify the need for amendments to better achieve those objectives.   

The Task Force received feedback from clerks, judges, attorneys, and AOIC staﬀ who 
have been intimately involved with the implementation of the Legislation.  The consensus 
is that while the initial implementation process was at times difficult, once implemented 
the Legislation made the system of court fees and costs vastly better.  Court clerks find it 
much simpler and easier to administer court fees and costs than before the enactment, 
and litigants have benefitted from the Legislation in the following respects:   

•

The nature and amount of assessments are much clearer and easier to understand.  
When the average citizen asks the Circuit Clerk, “where do all these fees come from?” 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

11

there is an easy answer and the fees can all be found in one place rather than 
scattered in many diﬀerent statutes. 

There is greater consistency across the state, so whether a citizen receives a traffic 
ticket in, say, Montgomery County or McHenry County, they will pay the same 
assessment amount for the same violation.  Similarly, while assessments in civil cases 
are not completely uniform statewide, the amount of variation between counties has 
been significantly reduced.  

In some counties, and on some case types, the average citizen is paying less than 
before.  Particularly significant in this regard is the reduction of the large Criminal/ 
Traffic Conviction Surcharge that had been imposed in some counties. 

There is also more accuracy in what is being assessed.  The relative simplicity of the 
CTAA and Section 27.1b has made it easier for circuit court clerks to determine the 
correct sums to be assessed.  

The expansion of assessment waivers under Section 27.1b and the authorization of 
assessment waivers under the CTAA have reduced the financial burden on low-income 
individuals in civil and criminal cases. 

The proliferation of add-on fees has been slowed since passage of the Legislation, and 
with it the trend toward imposing on litigants the responsibility for funding an 
increasing share of the cost of court proceedings.

Recommendations 

The Legislation’s success in addressing (while not completely solving) the problems 
identified in the 2016 Report warrants elimination of the sunset provisions.  Attached as 
Appendix A to this report is proposed legislation deleting the sunset provisions from the 
CTAA and Section 27.1b.

Implementation Issue 2: Definitions in the CTAA 

Why is this an issue?  

Section 1-5 of the CTAA contains its definitions.  705 ILCS 135/1-5.  Included is a definition 
of “case” as meaning “all charges and counts filed against a single defendant which are 
being prosecuted as a single proceeding before the court.”  Id.  This definition created 
some confusion, much of which has been cured by revisions to the Manual on 
Recordkeeping that were approved by the Supreme Court.  However, an issue remains 
regarding a situation where there may be one traffic stop, but two agencies (e.g., the 
Sheriﬀ and Village Police) issue tickets that are prosecuted by separate agencies (e.g., the 
State’s Attorney and Village Attorney).  It is unclear if this is one “case” or separate cases 
under the current definition.  

Additionally, the CTAA defines “assessments” as “costs imposed on a defendant under 
schedules 1 through 13 of this Act.”  Id.  The CTAA permits courts to waive “assessments.”  
See Section 5-10(e) (“Unless a court ordered payment schedule is implemented or the 
assessment requirements of this Act are waived under a court order[.]”) (emphasis added).  
This gives rise to a question:  if “assessments” can be waived, can all “costs” be waived as 
well?  Some “costs” are not true court assessments.  For example, an ambulance service 
which transports an injured defendant who causes a car crash while drunk may charge 
the defendant for the “cost” of their service, but that service is not an “assessment” under 
the CTAA.  That type of cost is distinguishable from, for example, a charge imposed by a 
court requiring a defendant to submit to a court-managed or supervised service.  The 
CTAA does not create a clear line between the two. 

Recommendation 

Attached as Appendix B to this report are various proposed changes to the CTAA’s 
definition section.  In particular, the revisions clarify that the definition of “case” includes 
all proceedings arising out of a single occurrence.   

The revised definitions also clarify that an assessment that is paid directly to the court is 
waivable.  An assessment paid to a third-party is only waivable if the third-party provided 
services pursuant to a contract with the court.  This distinction is also reflected, with 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

respect to assessment waivers in criminal and civil cases, in proposed revisions to 
Section 124A-20 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 1-105 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure that are contained in Appendix C. 

Implementation Issue 3: A Prosecutor’s Ability to Require a Criminal Defendant, 
as Part of a Negotiated Plea Agreement, to Relinquish the Right to Seek an 
Assessment Waiver 

Why is this an issue? 

The Task Force is aware, anecdotally, that some jurisdictions are requiring criminal 
defendants to relinquish their right to seek an assessment waiver as part of a negotiated 
plea.  The Task Force believes this practice undermines the fundamental goals of the 
CTAA, and it recommends that it be statutorily prohibited. 

Relevant Background.  The 2016 Report recommended that the legislature treat 
separately those things which are “fines” (i.e., punishment for the oﬀense charged) and 
those which are “assessments” (i.e., fees, costs and other charges designed to oﬀset the 
State’s cost of prosecuting the defendant).  Although court fees were originally intended 
“simply to oﬀset a portion of the cost of the services being provided,” they had grown 
complex and extensive. 

Because the justification for assessments is to help defray the cost of prosecution, rather 
than to punish the defendant, the Task Force recommended that the financial burden of 
assessments should not be imposed on those least capable of shouldering it.  This 
recommendation did not aﬀect judges’ ability to order restitution, assess fines, or impose 
prison sentences: 

While criminal defendants should face meaningful punishment for committing a 
crime, it is unjust and unwise to burden indigent criminal defendants with court 
assessments that are beyond their ability to pay and that create a disproportionate 
and counterproductive barrier to their reentry into society.  Rather than levy such 
assessments, which also impose administrative burdens on court clerks that are 
unwarranted by the potential amounts to be collected, it is preferable to allow 
judges to grant waivers.  Such waivers would facilitate judges’ ability to impose 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

14

fines (that, unlike fees, are designed to punish) at amounts that are commensurate 
with the crime.  Moreover, unlike assessments, in appropriate cases judges can 
authorize fines to be worked oﬀ through community service or similar programs.  4

The legislature acted on this recommendation when it passed the CTAA, establishing a 
more uniform and limited scheme for imposing assessments in criminal cases.  In 
addition, the legislature created a system under which criminal defendants could apply to 
the Court to have their fees waived.  Eligibility for a full or partial assessment waiver was 
defined by reference to the defendant’s income or receipt of a means-tested public 
benefit.  725 ILCS 5/124A-20.  The statute requires the circuit clerk to provide applications 
forms to “any defendant who indicates an inability to pay the assessments.”  725 ILCS 
5/124A-20(d).  Upon receipt of an application showing the defendant qualifies as an 
“indigent person” as defined by the CTAA, the court “shall grant” the application for the 
appropriate level (i.e., full or partial). 

The use of the word “shall” generally indicates that the legislature intended to impose a 
mandatory obligation.  Schultz v. Performance Lighting, Inc., 2013 IL 115738, ¶ 16.  The 
CTAA demonstrates the intention that its provisions are mandatory, i.e., that any 
defendant has the right to request an assessment waiver and any defendant who qualifies 
must be given such a waiver. 

Impact of Plea Bargaining.  As noted above, the Task Force is aware that, in some 
jurisdictions, the prosecuting office has adopted the practice of conditioning plea oﬀers 
on the defendant’s agreement to give up the right to seek a waiver—a “waiver of the 
waiver.”  The Task Force is concerned that this practice undercuts the policies which 
underlie the CTAA. 

The legislature’s purpose in providing for waivers of the assessments imposed on indigent 
defendants is that the responsibility to financially support the judicial system should not 
be placed on those least able to bear it.  Additionally, a plea agreement generally involves 
the defendant bargaining to preserve his or her personal liberty to the greatest extent 
possible; this puts the defendant in a significantly reduced bargaining position when 
compared to the prosecution.  Recalling that some 95-99% of all criminal dispositions are 
eﬀectuated by pleas, it would very nearly constitute a de facto repeal of the statutory 

4

 2016 Report at 34 (emphasis added)

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

15

assessment waiver provisions in those jurisdictions which condition plea agreements on 
the defendant giving up the statutory right to an assessment waiver.   

It is true that a negotiated plea is a voluntary agreement between the prosecution and the 
defendant, and such agreements are generally considered to be governed by the law 
applicable to private contracts.  People v. Nutall, 312 Ill. App. 3d 620, 637 (1st Dist. 2000).  
However, the analogy between pleas and private contracts “may not hold in all respects.”  
Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 137 (2009).  A criminal defendant’s underlying 
contract right is constitutionally based and reflects fundamentally diﬀerent concerns than 
those involved with private contracts; therefore, “application of contract law principles to 
plea agreements may require tempering in some instances.”  People v. Evans, 174 Ill. 2d 
320, 326–27 (1996).   

Furthermore, even with private contracts, parties are not permitted to include terms 
which are “against public policy” or “contravene some positive rule of law.”  County of 
Jackson v. Mediacom Illinois, LLC, 2012 IL App (5th) 110350, ¶11.  The legislature carefully 
crafted a scheme for the consolidation of all court costs and fees under the concept of 
“assessments,” along with a provision to allow indigent defendants to receive full or 
partial waivers of their obligation to pay those assessments.  This reflects a clear 
statement of Illinois public policy concerning the rights of those indigent defendants.  It 
is likely already contrary to public policy for prosecutors to require criminal defendants to 
bargain away that right as a condition of a plea agreement.  To the extent there is any 
doubt, the legislature should clarify that intent. 

Finally, there is another fundamental purpose of the CTAA frustrated by this practice:  
uniformity.  One of the animating goals of the CTAA was reducing the variability of 
financial consequences for the same crime from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  If some 
jurisdictions are preventing criminal defendants from seeking assessment waivers, it 
means that a defendant’s ability to exercise that right will depend on the jurisdiction in 
which the case against them is being prosecuted.   

Recommendation 

For the reasons stated above, the Task Force recommends that the legislature prohibit 
plea agreements which are conditioned upon the defendant giving up the right to seek 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

16

an assessment waiver.  We propose that this be accomplished by amending 725 ILCS 
5/124A-20 to add the following provision: 

(h)  No defendant shall be required to forego or waive his or her right to seek a 
waiver of assessments as a condition of any plea agreement. 

This proposed statutory amendment is included in Appendix D. 

Implementation Issue 4:  Lack of a Uniform Procedure Governing Assessment 
Waiver Applications 

Why is this an issue?  

Wide variations have developed in the procedures employed by courts in deciding 
applications for assessment waivers.  For example, some courts only require a hearing if 
there is a factual issue on the face of the application, while other courts require a hearing 
on every application.  Some courts require the applicant to provide proof of public 
benefits and others do not.  The list goes on.  These practices can even vary between 
courthouses in the same circuit.  

These inconsistent practices are problematic for several reasons.  First and foremost, they 
can lead to unequal treatment of similarly situated court users, some of whom would 
obtain waivers while others would not.  In addition, requiring litigants seeking a waiver to 
appear for a hearing, whether in person or via video conference, creates procedural 
hurdles for some litigants but not others.  Inconsistent practices also make it nearly 
impossible for those attempting to help pro se litigants to be able to provide detailed 
guidance to help them navigate this process. 

Research suggests that requiring an appearance in connection with an assessment 
waiver application creates an unnecessary risk that factors like physical appearance, race, 
and gender may inappropriately influence the decision.  Litigants appearing at a hearing 
may appear to have greater or fewer financial resources than they really do.  The visual 
information a judge can gain from requiring an appearance is not necessary for the 
consideration of the fee waiver application, and it may actually prevent the judge from 
making an accurate and unbiased decision. 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

17

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends that the Supreme Court Rules be amended to establish a 
uniform procedure governing assessment waivers that limits the circumstances in which 
a hearing can be conducted in civil cases and prevents the decision on an application for 
assessment waiver in a criminal case from being deferred until the defendant completes 
his or her sentence.  Appendix E contains proposed revisions to Rules 298 and 404 that 
would implement this recommendation.  

Implementation Issue 5:  Existence of Assessments in Statutes Outside of the 
CTAA and Section 27.1b 

Why is this an issue? 

A core principle adopted by the original Statutory Court Fee Task Force in its 2016 Report 
was that court assessments should be simple, easy to understand, and uniform to the 
extent possible.  At the time, the civil and criminal assessment landscape in Illinois 
consisted of a multitude of add-on fees that were scattered among many diﬀerent 
statutes, making it very difficult for civil and criminal litigants to accurately determine 
which fees would be imposed and what the true and final cost would be.  

Out of that core principle, the CTAA was adopted to codify and centralize all criminal 
assessments into a single statute, and civil assessments were consolidated into a single 
section, Section 27.1b of the Clerk of Courts Act.  These enactments have gone a long 
way toward simplifying and bringing transparency to the assessment process.  

In the process of consolidating the existing assessments into the CTAA and Section 27.1b, 
a significant number of statutory add-on fees were inadvertently missed and are still 
contained in various other statutes.  This has created confusion and lingering questions 
about whether, and to what extent, such outlier assessments may be assessed and 
whether they are subject to waiver.  

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

18

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends the General Assembly fully incorporate all assessments into 
either the CTAA or Section 27.1b.  Appendix F includes a complete list of all outlier civil 
and criminal add-on assessments identified by the Task Force and recommended for 
inclusion in either the CTAA (criminal assessments) or Clerk of Courts Act (civil 
assessments).   

Some of these assessments could be eliminated entirely.  The Task Force takes no 
position on whether an assessment should be eliminated.  However, if the assessment is 
not eliminated, Appendix F oﬀers a suggestion for where it should be moved. 

Implementation Issue 6:  Impact of the CTAA and Section 27.1b on County 
Budgets 

Why is this an issue?  

The judicial branch in Illinois operates, generally, from the following funding sources: 

1. The State pays for all judicial salaries and the operations and staﬀ salaries of the 

Supreme Court, Appellate Courts, and Administrative Office of the Illinois 
Courts.  It also reimburses the counties for probation costs.  

2. Trial court operations are funded through a combination of County general 
revenues, court assessments, and fines.  These funding sources support 
courthouse operations, salaries and operations of the circuit court clerk, 
courtroom security, and various other costs needed to operate the trial court.  

County appropriations to court operations have become severely stressed, especially in 
smaller rural counties.  While the CTAA and Section 27.1b have undoubtedly had some 
eﬀect on these budget pressures, the Task Force has been unable to determine how 
much.  This is due to several reasons.  

First, the Legislation dramatically changed both the system for imposing assessments in 
civil, criminal, and traffic cases as well as reporting requirements.  For example, 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

19

Section 27.1b expanded the availability of assessment waivers in civil cases, but the 
amount of waivers had not previously been tracked.  It is therefore impossible to 
determine the extent to which the expanded assessment waiver provisions in Section 
27.1b have aﬀected court budgets. 

Second, there has been a decade-plus decline in case filings across all case types.  Fewer 
cases mean fewer court assessments.  This has had a detrimental eﬀect on the amount of 
fees collected over time, and would have continued without passage of the Legislation.  

Third, the COVID-19 pandemic began approximately six months after the CTAA and 
Section 27.1b went into eﬀect.  The pandemic undoubtedly reduced the number of court 
filings, making it more difficult to measure the fiscal eﬀect of the Legislation. 

While it has not been possible to measure the eﬀect of the Legislation on county 
appropriations to trial court operations, the Task Force believes this is an issue of great 
importance that the General Assembly, the counties, and the judiciary should work 
cooperatively to address.  Indeed, this issue is likely to become even more important with 
the abolition of cash bail under the SAFE-T Act as well as current depopulation trends.  

Recommendation 

The problem here does not lie with the CTAA or Section 27.1b.  But the problem is of such 
importance the Task Force provides the following observations.  

The General Assembly in recent years has increased its appropriation to the Supreme 
Court to the point where it now fully funds the Court’s budget requests.  This includes, 
importantly, full funding for reimbursing counties’ probation costs.  Previously, counties 
were required to make up the shortfall or cut probation services.  By fully funding 
probation reimbursement costs, the General Assembly has taken an undue burden oﬀ 
counties and made a robust probation system possible. 

Additionally, this year the General Assembly for the first time (upon the first request) 
provided the Supreme Court with nearly $26 million to support the new pretrial services 
division of the AOIC.  The Office of Statewide Pretrial Services will provide support to trial 
courts for services relating to bail decisions and the monitoring of defendants released 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

20

pretrial.  This, too, will help ease the budget pressure on counties.  Further relief is 
expected from $10 million in technology improvements funded by the General Assembly 
to improve the efficiency of trial court operations.  

The Supreme Court, through the Illinois Judicial Conference, has created a Court Funding 
Task Force that is looking into the costs of operating the judicial system globally with the 
goal of making recommendations for improvements in the way the system is funded. 

Finally, counties have also invested in technology that has provided efficiencies that 
reduce staﬀ needs, paper storage costs, and myriad other costs associated with 
operating a court system.  And, of course, counties have provided funding to the courts 
from their general revenue budget beyond what the counties receive from fees and fines.  

The judicial branch is not an executive agency providing government services, but a 
separate branch of government.  There should never be a debate about how much 
service the judiciary should provide.  Thankfully all the partners in court funding have 
understood this.  But as the pressures on county budgets continue, the Task Force 
recommends the General Assembly, the judiciary, the counties, circuit court clerks, and 
the bar continue to work cooperatively to ensure that the judiciary remains capable of 
eﬀectively serving the public.  

Implementation Issue 7: Impact of the CTAA and Section 27.1b on Organizations 
That Receive Funding Through Assessments 
 
Why is this an issue? 

   

The previous system evolved through a series of well-intentioned measures that added a 
host of assessments that were individually small but significant—and significantly 
problematic—in the aggregate.  Over the years the General Assembly added assessments 
to provide funding to various worthy initiatives or organizations, such as court 
automation, law libraries, and children’s waiting rooms.  The previous system provided 
fixed amounts from various assessments to be allocated directly to such organizations.  

The Legislation changed that system.  It provides counties with the flexibility to decide 
how much to provide such organizations, if anything at all.  As a result, some 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

21

organizations may have received less funding from assessments than they did under the 
prior system, while at the local level some organizations may have experienced an 
increase.  

Recommendation  

The Task Force believes this is a feature, not a bug, of the new system.  Organizations are 
free to lobby the General Assembly if they believe they should be authorized to receive 
funding, and to work within counties to advocate for funding for their services.  But the 
Task Force does not believe organizations should receive set percentages or amounts 
from assessments to fund their programs.  Giving counties the flexibility to make those 
decisions provides for a more efficient system with greater accountability and flexibility.  

Implementation Issue 8:  Preventing Legislative Authorization of New Add-On 
Assessments 

Why is this an issue? 

The 2016 Report described the old system as “byzantine.”  And it was.  Court assessments 
were scattered throughout the Illinois Complied Statutes without much organization or 
thought.  This system had developed over time by individual assessments authorized by 
the General Assembly, all certainly enacted with good intentions.  But without 
considering these assessments within the context of the entire assessment structure, the 
aggregate amounts charged outpaced inflation and the system became increasingly 
complex, confusing, and difficult to manage.  The Task Force believes we should strive to 
avoid slipping back into such a system.  

There is no simple fix to this problem.  The General Assembly cannot prevent future 
General Assemblies from adding assessments outside the CTAA or Section 27.1b.  And 
future General Assemblies with new members and staﬀ will not know the history that led 
to enactment of the CTAA and Section 27.1b, so it is inevitable that someone at some 
point will seek to add an assessment outside the current structure.  

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

22

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends that any future legislation amending the CTAA and Section 
27.1b include findings that explain the history and purpose of those statutes so that future 
lawmakers will understand the importance of curbing increases in assessments and 
avoiding the creation of new assessments that are not subject to the overall limits created 
by those statutes.  Any future legislation that increases or creates new assessments 
should also include a finding which explains how the assessment either defrays the cost 
of the litigation or directly relates to the administration of the court system.  

Additionally, the Supreme Court, circuit clerks, and bar associations should vigilantly 
watch for new legislation that would add an assessment outside the current structure.  
When such legislation is introduced, those parties should lobby the General Assembly to 
ensure that, if additional assessments are authorized, they should be placed in the CTAA 
or Section 27.1b and should be required to adhere to the overall caps on assessments 
contained in those provisions.

II. Issues Regarding Court Assessments That Were Not Identified by 

the First Statutory Court Fee Task Force 

The New Initiatives Committee was tasked with considering potential additional measures 
intended to address problems identified by the original Task Force, as well as related 
problems.  After considering 16 potential initiatives, the Committee focused on the 
following seven subjects: 

1. The varying Federal Poverty Level thresholds for partial and total waivers of 

assessments in civil and criminal cases;  

2. The accounting fee and reporting fee charged to guardians in guardianship 

cases for disabled adults and children; 

3. Assessments imposed in delinquency proceedings in Juvenile Court;  

4. Collection practices regarding unpaid assessments; 

5. Assessments imposed on defendants sentenced to the Department of 

Corrections;  

6. Assessments that are not tied to court-related services and, therefore, may 

violate the free access clause of the Illinois Constitution; and  

7. A process for moving toward a unified and assessment-free court system. 

Each of these subjects was assigned to smaller subgroups of the New Initiatives 
Committee for further investigation and development of proposed legislation.  The 
resulting recommendations were ultimately reviewed and adopted by the Task Force, 
with some modifications and refinements.  The seven new initiatives are discussed below. 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

New Initiative 1: Assessments and Fines in Juvenile Delinquency Cases 

Should assessments and fines be eliminated, or should waivers be allowed, in juvenile 
delinquency cases? 

Issue 

Why is this an issue? 

A wide range of assessments are currently authorized in juvenile delinquency cases.  
These include assessments for probation, supervision, DNA testing, detention, legal 
representation, and diversion.  In practice, there is a great deal of variation from county 
to county regarding the extent to which assessments are imposed.  Across the board, 
relatively small amounts of revenue are generated from juvenile assessments, and often 
little if any attempt is made to collect outstanding juvenile assessment balances.  5

Research has found that assessments and fines in juvenile delinquency cases can 
undermine the goal of achieving rehabilitation and successful reentry into the community 
by leaving youths with significant debt and prolonging their involvement in the justice 
system.      Inability to pay assessments has also been associated with a significant 
increase in the likelihood of recidivism. 

6 7 8

 Data obtained by the Task Force’s Data Collection and Analysis Committee indicates that less 
han a third of Illinois counties impose any assessments or fines in juvenile delinquency cases.  
Only a handful of counties collected a total of more than $1,000 in assessments and fines during 
any of the last five years, and no county collected a total of more than $10,000 over that five-year 
period.

The additional stressor of the assessments and fines, especially when imposed without a 
determination of the youth’s ability to pay, can adversely aﬀect the youth’s trust in the 
fairness of the justice system and even reduce the youth’s compliance with orders and 
sentencing conditions.   Research has further found that states like Illinois that hold the 
parent and youth jointly liable can create divisiveness within the family during a time 
when family engagement is crucial to the rehabilitation of the youth and the youth’s 
successful reintegration into the community.

Juvenile assessments may also have disproportionate adverse eﬀects on families living in 
poverty and families of color.  Juvenile assessments can force low-income families to 
choose between paying the assessments and paying for necessities such as food, 
clothing, shelter, healthcare, and education.   In the juvenile court system, youths living

2. Before juvenile justice agencies punish youth for failing to pay fines and fees, they 

must first determine ability to pay, considering factors particularly applicable to youth. 

3. Juvenile justice agencies should not condition entry into a diversion program or 

another alternative to adjudication on the payment of a fee if the youth or the youth's 
family is unable to pay the fee. 

4. Juvenile justice agencies should collect data on race, national origin, sex, and 

disability to determine whether the imposition of fines and fees has an unlawful 
disparate impact on juveniles or their families. 

5. Juvenile justice agencies should consider whether the imposition or enforcement of 
fines and fees in any particular case comports with the rehabilitative goals of the 
juvenile justice system.14 

Since 2015, 21 states have reduced or eliminated assessments imposed on youths and 
families in juvenile cases.  One additional state, New York, has never charged 
assessments in juvenile cases.  

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends that legislation be enacted abolishing assessments and fines 
in juvenile delinquency cases, but preserving juveniles’ liability for restitution and for 
assessments in traffic cases.  Senate Bill 3621, which was filed in the spring 2022 
legislative session of the 102nd General Assembly, was designed to accomplish that 
objective.  The Task Force recommends that the General Assembly pass legislation 
substantially in the form of SB 3621.   

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

27

The “substantially in the form” qualification to this recommendation primarily reflects the 
reality that SB 3621 was a lengthy piece of legislation (90 pages) that is likely to be re-
filed during the 103rd General Assembly.  The Task Force believes the heart of the 
legislation was well-conceived and well-drafted.  The Task Force strongly urges that it be 
enacted. 

New Initiative 2: Fee for Guardian Reports 

Issue 

Reports by guardians of disabled adults and children may be ordered by the court 
pursuant to the Probate Act.  755 ILCS 5/11a-17.  There is a $25 fee for filing this report.  
705 ILCS 105/27/1b(v)(1). 

Why is this an issue? 

Assuming guardianship of a disabled adult or child is a significant responsibility—
emotionally, physically, and financially.  Even though guardians may seek reasonable 
compensation for guardianship duties, in practice many do not or there may be 
insufficient assets in the estate from which to be paid.  Most guardians are family 
members of the disabled adult or child, and most are self-represented after being 
appointed. 

A report must be filed every year, along with payment of the $25 fee, until the disabled 
adult or child emerges from guardianship or dies.  

Recommendation 

The Task Force considered whether the availability of fee waivers oﬀered a solution to this 
issue.  Fee waivers are available in guardianship cases.  However, fee waivers are only in 
eﬀect for a year, which would require obtaining an annual renewal in addition to filing the 
annual report.  See 735 ILCS 5/5-105(f). 

The amount of money collected from this fee is small.  The largest case management 
system vendor in Illinois cannot provide an estimate for this revenue because it is not

tracked separately from other miscellaneous circuit clerk fees.  However, in 2021, DuPage 
County collected approximately $20,000, McHenry County collected approximately 
$11,000, and Winnebago County collected approximately $3,000 in fees in guardianship 
cases. 

The Task Force recommends the annual fee in guardianship cases be removed from the 
Clerk of Courts Act by revising 705 ILCS 105/27.1b(v) as follows: 

(v) Probate filings. 
                (1)  For  each  account  (other  than  one  final  account)  filed  in  the  estate  of  a 
decedent,  or  ward,  the  fee  shall  not  exceed  $25.    No  fee  shall  be  charged  for 
accounts filed for guardianships established for minors pursuant to Article XI of the 
Probate Act or for disabled adults pursuant to Article XIa of the Probate Act. 

This proposed statutory amendment is included in Appendix G. 

New Initiative 3: Debt Collection Fees 

Issue 

There are a host of authorized assessments relating to eﬀorts by circuit court clerks to 
collect outstanding obligations.  The issue is whether all of those assessments are 
warranted. 

Why is this an issue? 

Any additional assessments imposed on civil litigants impede their access to the courts.  
Any additional assessments imposed on criminal defendants, while ostensibly not 
intended to punish, are indistinguishable from the defendant’s standpoint from fines that 
are intended to punish, and in some instances may be more punitive because 
assessments cannot be worked oﬀ through community service. 

There are two ways circuit clerks collect outstanding obligations.  The first is by using the 
Illinois Office of the Comptroller’s Local Debt Recovery Program (IDROP).  15 ILCS 
405/10.05-10.05D.  To use the IDROP program, circuit court clerks submit a data file 
listing outstanding debt.  IDROP intercepts state payouts to the obligor, including wages, 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

29

tax refunds, and lottery winnings.  For each successful intercept, the Comptroller 
assesses a fee of $15 or $20 to the obligor.  

Circuit clerks also use the State’s Attorney’s Office to collect outstanding obligations.  
730 ILCS 5/5-9-3(e).  The State’s Attorney may charge an additional 30% of the 
outstanding balance as a fee.  Many State’s Attorney’s offices have outsourced this 
function to private companies in exchange for the 30% collection fee. 

The only cost to the circuit clerk for collections work is the minor expense of creating the 
debt file and uploading it to the Comptroller or private debt collector.  However, 
collections can bring in significant amounts of money.  For example, in 2020, DuPage 
County collected over $1 million from both types of collection activities, and both 
Winnebago and McHenry counties collect hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  
This money is used to pay obligations owed to municipal governments and third-party 
vendor services, as well as county and court clerk services. 

There are two additional statutory provisions that add more financial penalties to obligors 
who do not make payments on their court debts.  705 ILCS 105/27.1b(j-5) allows the 
circuit clerk to collect an additional flat fee of $35-$65 depending on the amount of the 
debt.  Despite the statutory authorization, not all circuit clerks assess this additional 
amount.  705 ILCS 105/27.1b(y-5) and 725 ILCS 5/124A-10, allow the circuit clerk to charge 
an additional 5% to 15% of the outstanding balance of fees to defray administrative costs.  
Not all circuit clerks assess these additional charges, either.   

Recommendation 

The Task Force believes that it is excessive for there to be two potential charges on 
delinquent accounts in addition to the collection fees charged by IDROP or the State’s 
Attorney.  The Task Force recommends that 705 ILCS 105/27.1b(y-5) and the provisions of 
725 ILCS 5/124A-10 relating to additional fees be repealed.  The repeals will operate 
prospectively only.  This recommendation is not intended to require clerks to recalculate 
delinquency fees and unpaid balances that are already in debt collection, nor to refund 
any debt collection fees that have already been collected.

defendant is in custody for the fine or costs, or both. 

These proposed statutory amendments are contained in Appendix H. 

New Initiative 4:  Assessments and Fines Imposed on Defendants Sentenced to 
the Department of Corrections 

Issue 

Why is this an issue? 

Should assessments and fines be reduced or eliminated for defendants sentenced to the 
Department of Corrections (DOC)? 

Defendants convicted of felonies can accumulate large amounts of court assessments.  
Defendants who are released after completing a sentence in the DOC face the daunting 
prospect of trying to reintegrate into society, including finding employment and housing.  
Indebtedness poses a significant obstacle to this process.  This issue is well-documented.  
For example, a Brennan Center report from 2010 found that criminal justice debt 
significantly hobbles a person’s chances to reenter society successfully after a 
conviction.

Center for Justice (2010).

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

32

The Task Force attempted to weigh the adverse impact of assessments on recidivism and 
defendants’ ability to reintegrate into society, against the potential financial impact on 
counties of eliminating these assessments with respect to defendants sentenced to the 
DOC.  The Task Force sought data regarding the relationship between the length of 
defendants’ sentences and the amount of financial obligations incurred and paid.  While 
statewide data was unavailable, data from DuPage, McHenry, and Winnebago counties 
indicates that defendants sentenced to a prison term between one and eight years have a 
payment rate ranging between 15% and 25%.  For sentences over eight years, the 
payment rate drops to approximately 5%. 

The Task Force attempted to determine what portion of the payments were made using 
cash bond.  It was determined that a substantial portion (as high as 90%) of the payments 
are made from available cash bond.   

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends that defendants sentenced to the Department of 
Corrections earn a reduction in the amount of assessments (i.e., court costs and fees) and 
fines tied to the length of their prison sentence.  There would be a reduction in the 
amount of assessments and fines of 20% for each year of a sentence, with defendants 
sentenced to a prison term of five or more years earning a 100% reduction.  This 
recommendation is designed to simultaneously avoid burdening defendants sentenced 
to prison with significant prison debt, reduce barriers to their successful reentry into 
society following their release from custody, and relieve court officials of the 
administrative burden of tracking indebtedness that is rarely collected, all without 
imposing any significant financial impact on counties because of the poor prospects for 
collecting those assessments and fines. 

For the unusual situations in which a defendant sentenced to a prison term does have the 
wherewithal to pay the full amount of assessments and fines, the recommended 
legislation contains a provision allowing the State’s Attorney to file a motion seeking to 
exclude the reduction or elimination of liability for assessments and fines from the 
defendant’s sentence.  The court would then be tasked with determining whether the 
defendant is reasonably able to pay the full amount of the assessments and fines, with 
due regard for their current income, anticipated income while incarcerated (if any), 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

33

current assets and liabilities, and the anticipated cost, while they are incarcerated, of 
supporting persons who will remain dependent on them for support.  

The Task Force believes that a defendant’s financial responsibility for restitution is 
warranted to reimburse a victim for an actual realized loss from the actions of the 
defendant.  Consequently, a defendant’s liability for providing restitution is excluded from 
the recommended reduction or elimination of their liability for assessments and fines.  
Reducing or eliminating liability for assessments and fines is also expected to promote 
defendants’ ability to pay restitution. 

A copy of the proposed legislation eﬀecting this recommendation is contained in 
Appendix I. 

New Initiative 5: Eligibility Guidelines for Assessment Waivers in Civil Litigation 

Issue 

Why is this an issue? 

Should the eligibility guidelines for full or partial assessment waivers in civil cases be 
modified to mirror the more generous eligibility guidelines for full or partial assessment 
waivers in criminal cases? 

Section 5-105 of the Code of Civil Procedure authorizes full waivers of assessments in 
civil actions for persons whose income is 125% or less of the federal poverty level (“FPL”), 
or who are receiving assistance under specified means-based government public 
benefits programs, or whose payment of assessments would result in substantial 
hardship to the person or his or her family. Persons with income between 125% and 150% 
of the FPL are eligible for a 75% waiver; persons with income between 150% and 175% of 
the FPL are eligible for a 50% waiver; and persons with income between 175% and 200% 
of the FPL are eligible for a 25% waiver.  735 ILCS 5/5-105(b). 

The eligibility criteria for assessment waivers in criminal cases are more generous.  
Section 124A-20 of the Code of Criminal Procedure authorizes full assessment waivers for 
persons whose income is 200% or less of the FPL, or who are receiving assistance under 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

34

specified means-based government public benefits programs, or whose payment of 
assessments would result in substantial hardship to the person or his or her family.  
Persons with income between 200% and 250% of the FPL are eligible for a 75% waiver; 
persons with income between 250% and 300% of the FPL are eligible for a 50% waiver; 
and persons with income between 300% and 400% of the FPL are eligible for a 25% 
waiver.  725 ILCS 5/124A-20(b). 

Cost is a significant barrier to access to the civil justice system.  Aside from the potential 
budgetary impact, it is difficult to justify having two separate guidelines. 

Recommendation 

While most members of the Task Force believe the waiver thresholds should be the same 
for civil and criminal cases, the Task Force does not recommend implementing this 
change without first determining the budgetary impact on counties.  As previously noted, 
counties rely on assessments from civil cases to help fund court operations, including the 
circuit clerk’s office.  Rather than assume that counties can absorb the loss of income that 
might be created by changing the waiver thresholds, the Task Force recommends that (1) 
professionals be engaged to determine the financial impact of changing the waiver 
thresholds in civil cases to correspond with those applicable to criminal cases ; (2) a plan 
be devised to compensate counties for the anticipated loss of income; and (3) legislation 
be drafted that (a) brings the eligibility guidelines for assessment waivers in civil cases in 
line with those for criminal cases, while (b) compensating counties for the projected loss 
of income.

New Initiative 6: Review of Assessments That May Violate the Free Access 
Clause of the Illinois Constitution 

Issue 

16

 The Task Force gratefully acknowledges Stout, a global investment bank and advisory firm, for 

helping analyze this issue.  Led by Neil Steinkamp, Stout examined the potential incremental 
annual financial impact that could arise by aligning the civil fee waiver schedule with the criminal 
fee waiver schedule.  A copy of Stout’s analysis is available from the Access to Justice Division of 
the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts, https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/aoic/access-to-justice/. 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

35

Should the General Assembly identify and repeal assessments that may violate the free 
access clause of the Illinois Constitution? 

Why is this an issue?   

In Walker v. Chasteen, 2021 IL 126086, the Supreme Court held that the add-on filing fee 
on mortgage foreclosure complaints contained in Section 15-1504.1 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure (735 ILCS 5/15-1504.1) violated the free access clause of the Illinois 
Constitution, Ill. Const. 1970 art. I, § 12.  Enacted as part of the “Save Our Neighborhoods 
Act” in response to the mortgage foreclosure crisis, the legislation authorizing the fee 
directed that those funds be used to support the Foreclosure Program Prevention Fund 
and the Abandoned Residential Property Fund, including by subsidizing grants to housing 
counseling agencies, foreclosure prevention services, and municipalities for such things 
as cutting grass, removing garbage and graffiti, and erecting fencing at abandoned 
properties.  

In striking down the mortgage foreclosure fee, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding 
in Crocker v. Finley, 99 Ill. 2d 444, 451 (1984), that a charge imposed on a litigant is a 
permissible fee if assessed to defray the expenses of the litigation.  On the other hand, a 
charge having no relation to the court services rendered is a litigation tax that violates the 
free access and due process clauses of the Illinois Constitution unless it is imposed for 
purposes related to the operation and maintenance of the courts. 

Like the domestic violence filing fee in Crocker, the Supreme Court concluded that the 
mortgage foreclosure filing fee in Walker was actually a litigation tax, as it bore no direct 
relation to the expenses of the litigation or to the services rendered.  Because that tax 
was a revenue-raising measure designed to fund a statewide social program, which had 
no direct relation to the administration of the court system, the Court held that the fee 
unreasonably interfered with foreclosure litigants’ access to the courts in violation of the 
free access clause of the Illinois Constitution. 

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends that the General Assembly convene a legislative working 
group to review the list of civil statutory add-on fees located in Appendix F to ensure 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

36

consistency with the standard set out in Crocker and affirmed in Walker.  Any fees which 
do not defray the expenses of litigation should be considered litigation taxes which run 
afoul of the free access clause of the Illinois Constitution unless they have a direct 
relationship to the administration of the court system.  Litigation taxes which are merely 
designed to raise revenue to fund non-court-related social welfare programs should be 
repealed, and if the resulting revenue loss is problematic alternate funding sources for 
the aﬀected programs should be identified.  Any fees contained in Appendix F that are 
not repealed, due to the concerns identified in Crocker and Walker or for any other 
reason, should be moved into the CTAA or Section 27.1b, as provided in Implementation 
Recommendation No. 5. 

New Initiative 7:  Working Toward a Unified, Assessment-Free Court System 

Issue 

Why is this an issue? 

Should our state work to adopt a mechanism to “fully fund” the court system (a “unified” 
court system) and reduce or eliminate the use of assessments as a source of revenue? 

Access to justice is a fundamental right that should be provided and protected by the 
State.  The justice system benefits all of the state’s residents, not just those who come in 
contact with it.  It should, therefore, be funded by all of the residents.  The current system 
of funding disproportionately falls on those who use the system even though the system 
benefits everyone. 

The Illinois Judicial Conference Court Funding Task Force (“Court Funding Task Force”) 
was charged with determining the complete cost of the court system and identifying and 
explaining the multiple sources of funding, including answering key questions about 
court system funding, what the court system costs now, and where funding comes from.  
In its January 2021 Progress Report to the Judicial Conference, the Court Funding Task 
Force determined that from a funding perspective, the state court system can be broken 
down into four broad categories:  Personnel, Physical Space, Technology, and Other 
Needs and Services. 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

37

While financing the state court system is a shared responsibility between the State of 
Illinois and its 102 counties, the Court Funding Task Force found that most of the funding 
responsibility is borne by the counties.  For Fiscal Year 2019, the total amount of revenue 
for the Illinois court system from all sources was approximately $2.1 billion, as against 
expenditures of roughly $2.3 billion.  More than half of that revenue came from counties.  
Approximately $151.6 million, or roughly seven percent (7%) of total revenues, was 
generated from court assessments.

 17

Recommendation 

The CTAA and Section 27.1b reduced the number of assessments, grouped assessments 
for criminal cases into categories with specified assessment amounts, grouped 
assessments for civil cases into categories with specified maximum assessment amounts, 
and expanded the use of waivers.  While this has led to more transparent and 
understandable assessments, judges, court staﬀ, and clerk’s offices must still devote 
resources to the processes of fee determination, waiver, and collection.  Even with the 
remaining assessments, under the current model of funding the expenditures of the court 
system will likely exceed its total revenue, resulting in underfunding of a co-equal and 
important branch of the State’s government.  A fully taxpayer-funded court system would 
allocate the costs of the state court system across all taxpayers rather than imposing a 
disproportionate burden on parties to court proceedings.  All taxpayers benefit from a 
well-functioning judicial system.  As was stated in a 2013 Illinois State Bar Association 
report on the funding crisis in the Illinois courts, “[p]ut simply, an eﬀective civil and 
criminal court system is critical to the safety and well being of the people of this State.”  18

The Task Force recommends that all stakeholders develop a long-term funding plan for a 
unified Illinois court system that further reduces (or eliminates entirely) the use of 
assessments as a source of revenue.

 One member of the Task Force believes that consideration of the desirability of a unified court 

system exceeds the scope of this Task Force’s charge.

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

38

Other states’ funding models may provide a starting point.  In 1997, the State of California 
eliminated separate county and state budgeting for the court system and gave the state 
primary responsibility for funding trial court operations.  Following this consolidation, the 
Judicial Council in California worked toward a transparent model to distribute the 
branch’s budget funds to the state’s 58 trial courts.  The judicial branch’s “Workload 
Formula” determines the money a trial court receives based upon its workload; funding is 
based on the number of cases received as well as the types of cases handled annually.
  20
Court filings are averaged over time to avoid funding swings that might come with a 
surge or decline in filings.  The Judicial Council’s committees review the formula and its 
application and recommend amendments.  

Notably, the changes in the funding system in California did not eliminate criminal fines 
and fees or civil assessments.  The judicial branch of California has, however, advocated 
for a funding structure that ends its reliance on fines and fees from court users.
Task Force recommends that the State of Illinois adopt a similar long-term goal regarding 
assessments.

III. Data Collection and Reporting Needed to Provide Empirical Basis 

for Additional Improvements 

Accurate data is essential to evaluating the extent to which the CTAA and Section 27.1b 
are achieving their objectives, and to identifying opportunities for additional 
improvements.  Many of the recommendations contained in this report are based on data 
developed by the Task Force’s Data Collection & Analysis Committee to support the work 
of the Implementation Committee and the New Initiatives Committee.  To that end, the 
Data Collection & Analysis Committee obtained data regarding certain topics from all 102 
Illinois circuit clerks.  When that data was unavailable, the Committee obtained data from 
a representative subset of counties.  For other types of data, the Committee obtained 
information from the Conference of Chief Judges.  The Committee also worked with the 
Judicial Management Information Services division of the Administrative Office of Illinois 
Courts (AOIC) to identify areas where better financial data should be gathered from the 
circuit clerks, including data required by each circuit clerk’s annual financial “Report J.” 

Data Reporting Recommendation 1:  Continuation and Expansion of Annual 
Reports by Circuit Court Clerks Regarding Assessments in Criminal and Traffic 
Proceedings 

Issue 

Why is this an issue? 

Should circuit court clerks be required to file annual reports with the AOIC containing 
detailed information relating to assessments in criminal and traffic proceedings? 

Section 1-10 of the CTAA required circuit clerks to file annual reports with the AOIC 
containing detailed information regarding, among other things, the number of various 
types of criminal and traffic cases that were filed, the number and amount of 
assessments imposed and collected, the number and amount of fines imposed and 
collected, the number of assessment waiver applications that were granted at each 
waiver level between 25 and 100 percent, and the amount of assessments that were 
waived.  705 ILCS 135/1-10.  The CTAA only required assessment reports to be filed for 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

40

calendar year 2019, but reports were also filed for 2020 and 2021 pursuant to Supreme 
Court order. 

Recommendation 

The Task Force recommends revising Section 1-10 of the CTAA to require assessment 
reports for a calendar year to be filed no later than March 1 of the following year.  The Task 
Force also recommends expanding the content of the reports to include the number of 
assessment waiver applications that are filed.  Recommended statutory language is 
contained in Appendix J to this report. 

Data Reporting Recommendation 2:  Continuation and Expansion of Annual 
Reports by Circuit Court Clerks Regarding Assessments in Civil Cases 

Should circuit court clerks be required to file annual reports with the AOIC containing 
detailed information relating to assessments in civil cases? 

Section 27.1c of the Clerk of Courts Act contains a reporting requirement for civil cases 
that is analogous to the reporting requirement for criminal and traffic cases contained in 
Section 1-10 of the CTAA.  The primary diﬀerence from the CTAA provision is that 
Section 27.1c is not limited to 2019.  However, both provisions did not originally contain a 
requirement that the number of assessment waiver applications be reported.

CONCLUSION 

Data Reporting Recommendation 3:  Continuation of Efforts by Circuit Clerks 
and the Judicial Management Information Services Division to Make Better Use 
of Assessment-Related Data Reported by the Clerks 

Should the Supreme Court direct the AOIC’s Judicial Management Information Services 
division (JMIS) to continue to work with circuit court clerks to make better use of 
assessment-related data reported by the clerks? 

The annual “Report J” filed by circuit court clerks includes detailed financial data on every 
assessment and fine collected by circuit clerks across the state.  The JMIS division has 
undertaken a project to consolidate several data sets provided by circuit clerks, which 
will improve our long-term ability to identify the impact of the CTAA and Section 27.1b, as 
well as the projected impact of proposed legislation relating to assessments. 

The Task Force recommends that the Supreme Court direct the JMIS Division of the AOIC 
to continue to work with the circuit clerks to make better use of the assessment data the 
clerks are reporting to the AOIC.  

The legislation and court rules resulting from the eﬀorts of the first Statutory Court Fee 
Task Force have enabled our State to make significant strides in terms of reducing 
barriers to access to justice associated with court assessments, addressing excessive 
variation in the amount of assessments charged in diﬀerent counties, simplifying the 
system of assessments, and deterring the proliferation of additional assessments.  Given 
the length and complexity of the CTAA and Section 27.1b, it was anticipated that issues 
would arise in implementing that legislation that would require subsequent legislative 
corrections.  The nine Implementation Recommendations in this report eﬀectively 
address those issues. 

ILLINOIS STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE

42

It was also recognized that additional areas remained in which future improvements to 
the system of assessments would be needed.  Enactment of legislation implementing the 
seven New Initiative Recommendations will build on the progress that has already been 
achieved toward realizing the goals articulated by the first Task Force, while eﬀectuation 
of the Data Collection and Reporting Recommendations will provide stakeholders with 
empirical information needed to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the current system and 
identify opportunities for future improvements. 

The members of the Task Force recognize that, as was the case with the issuance of the 
first Task Force Report, issuance of this report does not mean that the Task Force’s 
responsibilities have been discharged.  The Task Force is committed to working with the 
General Assembly and the Supreme Court to help make implementation of the 
recommendations contained in these pages a reality through enactment of legislation 
and promulgation of court rules.

Applicants  receiving  assistance  under  one  or  more  of  the  means-based  governmental 
public benefits programs are not required to provide any additional financial information 
because they have been screened, reviewed, and approved by the relevant government 
agency and regular recertification is required to maintain that benefit.  

Paragraph (c)

deferring ruling on an Application for Waiver of Court Assessments until after completion 
of  the  sentence.    Criminal  Assessments  must  be  imposed  by  the  court  at  the  time  of 
sentencing.    Where  possible,  a  ruling  on  whether  the  defendant  qualifies  for  a  full  or 
partial waiver should also be determined at the time of sentencing, or within a reasonable 
time  thereafter  if  the  defendant  submits  an  Application  under  paragraph  (a)  or  a 
certification under paragraph (d) after sentencing.

(725 ILCS 5/124A-10)  

Sec.  124A-10.  Lien.  The  property,  real  and  personal,  of  a 
person who is convicted of an oﬀense shall be bound, and a lien

far as will be sufficient to pay the fine and costs of prosecution. 
The clerk of the court in which the conviction is had shall upon 
the  expiration  of  30  days  after  judgment  is  entered  issue  a 
certified copy of the judgment for any fine that remains unpaid,

5%  of  the  unpaid  fines,  costs,  fees,  and  penalties  that  remain 
unpaid after 30 days, 10% of the unpaid fines, costs, fees, and 
penalties  that  remain  unpaid  after  60  days,  and  15%  of  the

delinquency amounts collected under this Section shall be used 
to defray additional administrative costs incurred by the clerk of 
the  court  in  collecting  unpaid  fines,  costs,  fees,  and  penalties. 
The certified copy of the judgment shall state the day on which 
the  arrest  was  made  or  indictment  found,  as  the  case  may  be. 
Enforcement  of  the  judgment  may  be  directed  to  the  proper 
officer  of  any  county  in  this  State.  The  officer  to  whom  the 
certified  copy  of  the  judgment  is  delivered  shall  levy  the 
judgment  upon  all  the  estate,  real  and  personal,  of  the 
defendant (not exempt from enforcement) possessed by him or 
her on the day of the arrest or finding the indictment, as stated 
in  the  certified  copy  of  the  judgment  and  any  such  property 
subsequently  acquired;  and  the  property  so  levied  upon  shall 
be  advertised  and  sold  in  the  same  manner  as  in  civil  cases, 
with  the  like  rights  to  all  parties  that  may  be  interested  in  the 
property.  It  is  not  an  objection  to  the  selling  of  any  property 
under the judgment that the defendant is in custody for the fine 
or costs, or both.

EARN-DOWN REDUCTION OF ASSESSMENTS AND FINES  
FOR DEFENDANTS   SENTENCED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF 
CORRECTIONS 

Section 124A-25 is added to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 725 ILCS 5/124A-25, to 

read as follows: 

(725 ILCS 5/124A-25) 

Sec. 124A-25.  Earn-down reduction of assessments imposed on 

defendants sentenced to the Department of Corrections. 

(a)

As used in this Section: 

(1)

(2)

(1)

(2)

(3)

“Assessments”  means  any  costs  imposed  on  a  criminal 
defendant  under  Article  15  of  the  Criminal  and  Traffic 
Assessment Act, including but not limited to assessments 
relating to violations of the Illinois Vehicle Code, after the 
application  of  any 
income-based  waiver  under 
Section 124A-20. 

“Prison term” means the longest term of imprisonment to 
which  a  defendant  is  sentenced  in  a  case,  either  for  a 
single  oﬀense  or  in  the  aggregate  for  multiple  oﬀenses 
that  run  consecutively,  and  without  regard  to  any  credit 
for  time  served  in  custody,  home  detention,  or  for  any 
other reason. 

(b)

The court shall, without application, reduce the total amount of 
assessments  imposed  on  a  defendant  who  is  sentenced  to  a 
term of imprisonment in that case, as follows: 

20%  for  a  prison  term  of  at  least  one  year  but  less  than 
two years; 

40% for a prison term of at least two years but less than 
three years; 

60% for a prison term of at least three years but less than 
four years; 

Appendix I

65

(4)

80% for a prison term of at least four years but less than 
five years; and 

(5)

100% for a prison term of five or more years. 

(c)

The  State’s  Attorney  may  file  a  motion  to  eliminate  any 
reduction  in  assessments,  pursuant  to  subsection  (b),  in  the 
sentence of a defendant whom the State’s Attorney believes is 
reasonably  capable  of  paying  the  full  amount  of  the 
assessments.    The  decision  whether  to  deny  the  motion  or  to 
require  the  defendant  to  provide  information  bearing  on  their 
ability  to  pay  the  assessments  is  committed  to  the  sound 
discretion  of  the  court.    If  the  court  requires  the  defendant  to 
provide such information: 

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

Unless the defendant has already done so, the court shall 
order  the  defendant  to  complete  the  “Application  for 
Waiver  of  Criminal  Court  Assessments”  approved  by  the 
Illinois Supreme Court; 

The  motion  shall  be  denied  if  the  defendant  provides  a 
current  benefits  statement  or  other  documentary  proof 
of  their  receipt  of  assistance  under  one  or  more  of  the 
means-based  governmental  public  benefits  programs 
listed in 725 ILCS 5/124A-20(c)(1).  Such a defendant shall 
not  be  required  to  provide  any  additional  information 
about their income, assets, debts, or expenses.   

A  defendant  who  is  not  receiving  a  means-based 
governmental  public  benefit  shall  provide  financial 
information  and  supporting  documentation  relating  to 
the  factors  listed  in  725  ILCS  5/124A-20(c)(1)(2-6), 
including their most recent pay stubs from all employers, 
1099s, and W-2s. 

The  court  may  decline  to  reduce,  pursuant  to 
subsection  (b),  the  amount  of  assessments  imposed  on 
the  defendant  if  the  court  enters  a  written  finding  that 
there  is  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the 
defendant  can  aﬀord  to  pay  the  full  amount  of  the 

Appendix I

66

assessments,  after  considering  the  defendant’s  current 
income,  anticipated  income  while  incarcerated  (if  any), 
current  assets  and  liabilities,  and  the  anticipated  cost, 
while  the  defendant  is  incarcerated,  of  supporting 
persons who will remain dependent on the defendant for 
support. 

Section 5-9-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 ILCS 5/5-9-1, is revised 

to read as follows: 

(730 ILCS 5/5-9-1) 

Sec. 5-9-1. Authorized Fines. 

(a) An oﬀender may be sentenced to pay a fine as provided in Article 4.5 of Chapter 

V, subject to subsection (f) of this section. 

*          *          * 

(f) 

The court shall, without application, reduce the total amount of fines 

imposed on an oﬀender who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment as follows: 

(1) 

20%  for  a  prison  term  of  at  least  one  year  but  less  than  two 

years; 

years; 

years; 

years; and 

(2) 

40%  for  a  prison  term  of  at  least  two  years  but  less  than  three 

(3) 

60% for a prison term of at least three years but less than four 

(4) 

80%  for  a  prison  term  of  at  least  four  years  but  less  than  five 

(5) 

100% for a prison term of five or more years. 

(g)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  (f),  “prison  term”  means  the  longest  term  of 
imprisonment  to  which  an  oﬀender  is  sentenced  in  a  case,  either  for  a  single 
oﬀense  or  in  the  aggregate  for  multiple  oﬀenses  that  run  consecutively,  and 
without regard to any credit for time served in custody, home detention, or for any 
other reason. 

Appendix I

67

(h) The State’s Attorney may file a motion to eliminate any reduction in fines, 
pursuant  to  subsection  (f),  in  the  sentence  of  an  oﬀender  whom  the  State’s 
Attorney believes is reasonably capable of paying the full amount of the fines.  The 
decision  whether  to  deny  the  motion  or  to  require  the  oﬀender  to  provide 
information  bearing  on  their  ability  to  pay  the  fines  is  committed  to  the  sound 
discretion  of  the  court. 
  If  the  court  requires  the  oﬀender  to  provide  such 
information: 

(1) 

Unless  the  oﬀender  has  already  done  so,  the  court  shall  order 
the  oﬀender  to  complete  the  “Application  for  Waiver  of  Criminal  Court 
Assessments” approved by the Illinois Supreme Court; 

(2) 

The  motion  shall  be  denied  if  the  oﬀender  provides  a  current 
benefits statement or other documentary proof of their receipt of assistance 
under  one  or  more  of  the  means-based  governmental  public  benefits 
programs  listed  in  725  ILCS  5/124A-20(c)(1).    Such  an  oﬀender  shall  not  be 
required  to  provide  any  additional  information  about  their  income,  assets, 
debts, or expenses.   

(3) 

An oﬀender who is not receiving a means-based governmental 
public  benefit  shall  provide  financial  information  and  supporting 
documentation relating to the factors listed in 725 ILCS 5/124A-20(c)(1)(2-6), 
including their most recent pay stubs from all employers, 1099s, and W-2s. 

(4) 

The court may decline to reduce, pursuant to subsection (f), the 
total  amount  of  fines  imposed  on  the  oﬀender  if  the  court  enters  a  written 
finding  determining  that  there  is  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the 
oﬀender can aﬀord to pay the full amount of the fines, after considering the 
oﬀender’s  current  income,  anticipated  income  while  incarcerated  (if  any), 
current assets and liabilities, and the anticipated cost, while the oﬀender is 
incarcerated,  of  supporting  persons  who  will  remain  dependent  on  the 
oﬀender for support.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
