      <pre>HOW TO ASK THE COURT TO 
 
 
 
VACATE A DEFAULT JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What is a default judgment? 
 
o  You are in default if you do not respond to a 

 

 

o 

 

Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint and do not file an 
 
Appearance or Answer with the court. 
If you are in default, the judge may enter a default 
judgment in favor of the other party without hearing 
from you first. 

 

o  You may be able to vacate (undo) the default 
judgment by filing a Motion to Vacate Default 
Judgment of Foreclosure. 

 

 
When should I file my Motion to Vacate? 
o  Do not wait! File your Motion to Vacate Default 
 
 

 

 

Judgment of Foreclosure as soon as you learn that a 
default judgment has been entered against you. 
o  The court is more likely to grant your Motion to 

 

 

 

 

 

Vacate Default Judgment of Foreclosure if you file it 
no later than 30 days after the date the default 
judgment was entered against you. 

 

 

o  You can file the Motion to Vacate Default Judgment 
 
of Foreclosure up until the date the Plaintiff files a 
Motion to Confirm the Foreclosure Sale. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NOTE: If you have legal reason to challenge (quash) the 
claim that you were served with the summons and a 
copy of the Foreclosure Complaint,  you need to file a 
Motion to Quash under 735 ILCS 5/2-301 before you file 
 
 
your Motion to Vacate a Default Judgment of 
Foreclosure or at the same time under 735 ILCS 5/2-
 
619.1. You may want to consult with a lawyer about 
 
whether you have a legal reason to challenge (quash) 
 
service. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What do these terms mean? 
o  Order: A direction given by a judge requiring or 
allowing a person to do or not do something. 

 

 

o  Judgment of Foreclosure: A court document that a 
judge signs allowing the bank to sell the property. 
o  Vacate an Order or Judgment: to undo  an order or 

 

 

 

 

judgment that has been signed by a judge. 

 

 

 
When can I file a Motion to Vacate Default Judgment 
 
of Foreclosure? 
o  Your name is listed on the Summons and the 
 
 

Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint as a “Defendant”; 
 

o  An “Order of Default” has been entered; AND 
o  A “Judgment of Foreclosure” was entered. 

 

 

 

 

NOTE: Each party in default must file a Motion to Vacate  
 
Default Judgment of Foreclosure, either separately or 
 
together. 

 

 

 

 

What forms do I fill out to ask the judge to vacate a
 
Default Judgment of Foreclosure? 
o  Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of 

Foreclosure asks the judge to undo the previous 
order allowing the bank to sell the property; AND 
o  Notice of Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of 
Foreclosure tells all parties in the foreclosure case 
that you are asking the judge to undo the Default 
Judgment of Foreclosure. 

 

 

 

 
Where can I find the forms that I need? 
o  You can find the forms at: 

illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 
What costs will I need to pay to ask the court to
 
vacate a Default Judgment of Foreclosure? 
o  There may be a fee to file your Motion to Vacate 
Default Judgment of Foreclosure with the Circuit 
Clerk. 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees found at 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

o 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What do I do after I fill out my Motion to Vacate 
 
Default Judgment of Foreclosure? 

 

 

   

 
Step 1: File your forms with the Circuit Clerk in the
county where the court case is filed. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; or (2) 
you have trouble reading or speaking in English. 

 

 

 

 

• 

 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default.asp. 
•  To receive an exemption, file the original and 1 

 

 

 

copy of your Motion to Vacate Default Judgment 
of Foreclosure, and the Certification, with the 
Circuit Clerk’s office in person or by mail. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

 

 

 

provider. 
•  Visit illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm to 

 

 

select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a

for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
user guides here: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/CivilJustice/Resources/Self-
  
Represented_Litigants/self-represented.asp 
If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
  
terminal to e-file your forms. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 

o 
 

  
a flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

 
that you can use to e-file your forms 

 

 

 

o 
 

 
  
 
Step 2: Ask for a court date. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
 
 
  
date or if one will be scheduled automatically. 
If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
 
Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
with other court staff. 

 
o  When you get your court date, ask if the court will 
 
 
 
send notice of the court date to the other party or if 
you need to. 
 
 

o  Enter the date and time in section 1 of the Notice of 
 
 
Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of Foreclosure. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Step 3: Send a copy of your Motion to Vacate Default 
 
Judgment of Foreclosure to the other parties. 
o  You must send your Motion to Vacate Default 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
Judgment of Foreclosure to the other parties in the 
case. If a party has a lawyer, send the form to the 
 
lawyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You may send your Motion to Vacate Default 
 
 
 
 
 
Judgment of Foreclosure to the other parties 
 
personally, by mail, third-party commercial carrier 
 
(e.g., FedEx or UPS), or through the court's 
electronic filing manager or an approved e-filing 
  
service provider. 
•  You may send your Motion to Vacate Default 
 
 
 
 
Judgment of Foreclosure to a party by email if 
 
they have listed their e-mail address on a court 
 
document.  Complete the Proof of Delivery with 
 
information of how you sent the form to each 
party. It has room for 3 parties. If you are 
 
sending your form to more than 3 parties, fill out 
 
and file one or more Additional Proof of Service 
forms with the main form. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 4: Get ready for your court date. 
o  Decide and write down: 
 
 
•  What you want to ask the judge to do for you; 
 
 

 

 

 
AND 

•  What you will say to the judge if asked to tell 
 
 

  
your side of the case. 

o  Gather and make copies of pictures and documents 
 
 
 
you want the judge to see. Bring the original for the 
 
judge and one copy for you and each of the other 
 
parties in the case. 

 

 

 
 
 
Step 5: Go to your court date. 
o  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 

•  A copy of the Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint 
 
 

 
and Summons; 

•  Two copies of your completed and stamped 
 
 
Motion to Vacate Default Judgment of 
 
 
Foreclosure and Notice of Motion to Vacate 
 
 
Default Judgment of Foreclosure; 
•  An Order to Vacate Default Judgment of 
 
 
 
Foreclosure; AND 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Other documents related to your mortgage or 
 
 
 
 
home such as: proof of your payment history, 
loan modification packet, information from a 
 
housing counselor, real estate sale contract, 
 
proof of employment or other income. 
o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early 
 
 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
 
 

 

 

 
form. If your forms do not have a courtroom number 
look for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the 
Circuit Clerk. 

   

 

 

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

 
name and case number to be called. 

o  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 
 

 
introduce yourself, and briefly tell the judge what you 
 
are asking for. The judge will let you know what will 
 
happen next. 

 
 
 
How do I present my case to the judge? 
 
Step 1: Tell the judge your side of the case and
 
answer questions. 
o  Bring any important documents relating to your 
 
 
 

 
foreclosure including documents mentioned above. 
•  Give a copy to the judge and a copy to the other 
 
 

 

 

 

 

parties. Be prepared to explain why the 
 
document is important. 

 

o  The judge decides what documents can be 
 

 
considered in making a decision about your case. 

 

   

 

 

 
 
Step 2: What do I do when the other party presents
 
their case? 
o  The other party will also get to present their case by 
 
 

testifying, giving the judge evidence, and 
  
questioning witnesses. 
o  You will get to see any documents and photos the 
 
other party brings to court. If you do not think the 
judge should consider them in making a decision 
 
about your case, tell the judge why. 
o  You may ask questions of the other party’s 
 
 

 
witnesses. Write down your questions while they are 
 
 
speaking to the other party or judge.

(06/20) 

Step 3: What happens after both sides present their
 
case? 
 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 
 
 

o 
 

o 
 

o 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

   

called a court order. 
 
If the judge needs more information to make a 
 
decision, the judge may set up another court date. 
 
Make sure you understand what information is 
 
needed and get it before the new court date. 
  
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge 
 
may let you know the decision later by mailing a 
court order or at another court date. 
If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
 
decide right then and fill out a court order. Get a file-
stamped copy of the order. 
 
If the other party was not in court to get a copy, you 
 
 
must send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the date you 
 
get the order. Fill out and file a Proof of Delivery 
 
court form with the Circuit Clerk to show that you 
 
sent the copy. You may find the Proof of Delivery at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/.
