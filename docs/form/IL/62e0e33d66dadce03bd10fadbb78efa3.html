Return/Affidavit . of Service . is filed with the Circuit Clerk. . The judge . has no power to do anything if the . Citation . is not served. . o If the Return/Affidavit of Service says ﬁno service, ﬂ this . means that the sheriff's deputy tried to find the . debtor. , but could not serve the . debtor. .

If it says the . debtor . moved, or does not live at . the address you wrote down, you should find a new . . address for the . debtor . before starting again. .

(if it is not already in the court . file) . . o Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. . o Go to the courtroom number listed on your court form. If . your form do. es not have a courtroom number. , look for a . list of cases at the courthouse. , or ask the Circuit Clerk. . o Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your name . . and case number to be called. .

The . debtor may file that form before the court date . or may bring it with them to court. You can also . look at that. You can ask other questions . besides the questions on the form. . However, . the . form is a good place to start. . Please note that the . debtor . has certain . exemptions that protect . their . income and . property. . The judge . will not force . the debtor to . make payments of exempt funds. . See . paragraphs . six . and s. even . of the . Citation to . Discover Asset. s to Debtor. .

If you reach an agreement, let the . judge know when the case is called . again. . If the . judge approves the agreement, it will become a . . Court Ordered Payment Plan. . If there is no agreement, tell the judge what you . found out about the debtor™s income and assets . and ask the . judge . to order the debtor to give you . the debtor™s income and property if it is not . . exempt. The judge can also order the debtor to . . make payments to you from their income. . o What if someone else owns or . controls . the property . (like a bank or an employer) . ? If the judge finds that the debtor has property in . . someone else's possession, the judge may or . . may not order the debtor to turn over the . property directly to you. You must then follow . the process to get the money from the person . . who controls it. For more information about this . process, see the . Citation to Discover Assets to . Debtor's Employer . or Citation to Discover . Assets to Debtor's Bank . found here: . http: //www. illinoiscourts. gov/Forms/approved/. . The judge will dismiss the . Citation . if all . the . debtor™s income and property are exempt. . Find Illinois Supreme Court . approved forms at: . http: //www. illinoiscourts. gov/Forms/approved/. . SC I 1802. 1 .
