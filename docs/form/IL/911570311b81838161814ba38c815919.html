I. 

Executive Summary

Illinois  imposes  a  dizzying  array  of  filing  fees  on  civil  litigants  and  court  costs  on  defendants  in  criminal 
and  traffic  cases.  Skyrocketing  fees  in  civil  cases  in  recent  years  have  effectively  priced  many  of  our  state’s  most 
economically vulnerable citizens out of the opportunity to participate in the court system. Similar increases in court 
costs for criminal and traffic proceedings now often result in financial impacts that are excessive for the offense in 
question and disproportionate to the fines that are intended to impose an appropriate punishment for the offense. 
In virtually all civil, traffic, and criminal proceedings, wide county-to-county variations in the fees and costs for the 
same type of proceedings injects additional arbitrariness and unfairness into the system.

Solutions to these problems have been identified. The Access to Justice Act created the Statutory Court Fee 
Task  Force  (hereafter  “Task  Force”)  -  with  members  appointed  by  representatives  of  all  three  branches  of  Illinois 
government and both political parties - to study the current system of fees, fines, and other court costs (collectively, 
“assessments”) and propose recommendations to the Illinois General Assembly and the Illinois Supreme Court to 
address  this  growing  problem.  Drawing  upon  the  broad  and  varied  experience  of  its  members,  whose  numbers 
include legislators, judges, lawyers, and court clerks, the Task Force developed the package of recommendations 
contained  in  this  Report.  The  members  of  the  Task  Force  unanimously  support  adoption  and  implementation  of 
these recommendations.

The recommendations address the problems summarized in four key findings by the Task Force presented 
below.  The  Task  Force  developed  guiding  principles,  also  summarized  below,  to  articulate  a  comprehensive  and 
internally  consistent  philosophy  for  addressing  the  findings.  The  Task  Force  eventually  developed,  refined, 
and  finalized  six  recommendations  that  collectively  will  simplify  the  imposition,  collection,  and  distribution  of 
assessments while making them more transparent, affordable, and fair. 

 

The four key findings of the Task Force are as follows: 

1.  The nature and purpose of assessments have changed over time, leading to a byzantine system that attempts to 

pass an increased share of the cost of court administration onto the parties to court proceedings.

The notion of a self-funded court system has gained increased currency in recent years, resulting in a complex 
web of filing fees, fines, surcharges, and other costs levied against civil litigants and criminal defendants. 
Cumulatively substantial despite often being individually modest, these assessments undermine the state’s 
commitment to provide its citizens with access to the courts in civil proceedings, while distorting and unduly 
increasing the financial repercussions associated with criminal and traffic charges. 

These problems have been exacerbated by the ability of various special interest groups to finance aspects 
of their operations on the backs of court users. Today, it is all too common for litigants to pay for services 
through additional assessments that are wholly unrelated to the court system.

2.  Court fines and fees are constantly increasing and are outpacing inflation. 

There  has  been  a  tremendous  growth  in  the  assessments  imposed  on  the  parties  to  court  proceedings. 
Plaintiffs generally pay several hundred dollars simply to file a case. Civil defendants, who lack any say in 
whether to become involved in litigation, are often required to pay hundreds of dollars to defend themselves 
or  risk  a  default  judgment.  Criminal  and  traffic  defendants  frequently  leave  court  with  hundreds,  or  even 
thousands,  of  dollars  in  assessments  on  top  of  what  are  supposed  to  be  the  only  financial  consequences 
intended to punish, namely, fines imposed by the court. The trend shows no sign of abating, as each new 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 1

legislative  session  brings  with  it  fresh  proposals  for  increased  or  additional  assessments.  At  a  time  when 
many  wages  are  stagnant,  these  additional  assessments  are  creating  further  financial  strain  on  low-  and 
moderate-income litigants. 

3.  There is excessive variation across the state in the amount of assessments for the same type of proceedings.

The fairness of a court system is often measured in part by its consistency. It is therefore troubling that civil 
and  criminal  assessments  in  our  state  are  wildly  inconsistent  from  county  to  county.  A  civil  litigant  may 
pay  three  times  as  much  as  a  resident  in  a  neighboring  county  for  the  exact  same  court  service.  Criminal 
defendants may find that their sentences can be severely impacted by something as insignificant as the side 
of the street on which their arrest occurred. The resulting inconsistency threatens the fairness, both actual 
and perceived, of the current system.

4.  The  cumulative  impact  of  the  assessments  imposed  on  parties  to  civil  lawsuits  and  defendants  in  criminal 
and  traffic  proceedings  imposes  severe  and  disproportionate  impacts  on  low-  and  moderate-income  Illinois 
residents. 

The  collective  impact  of  the  current  system  of  assessments  is  significant  on  financially  insecure  Illinois 
residents. Individuals and families in need of a legal remedy may go without if the costs of using the courts 
are too high. Criminal defendants may find their reentry into society severely burdened if their court debt is 
unmanageable. Without relief from runaway court costs, more and more Illinois residents will be forced to 
decide between protecting their legal rights and paying their basic living expenses. 

These  findings  led  the  Task  Force  to  adopt  five  core  principles,  which  informed  and  influenced  all  of  its 

 
recommendations:

1.  Role of Assessments in Funding the Courts. 

Courts should be substantially funded from general government revenue sources. Court users may be required 
to pay reasonable assessments to offset a portion of the cost of the courts borne by the public-at-large.

2.  Relationship between Assessments and Access to the Courts. 

The  amount  of  assessments  should  not  impede  access  to  the  courts  and  should  be  waived,  to  the  extent 
possible, for indigent litigants and the working poor.

3.  Transparency and Uniformity. 

Assessments should be simple, easy to understand, and uniform to the extent possible.

4.  Relationship between Assessments and Their Underlying Rationale. 

Assessments  should  be  directly  related  to  the  operation  of  the  court  system.  Assessments  imposed  for  a 
particular  purpose  should  be  limited  to  the  types  of  court  proceedings  that  are  related  to  that  purpose. 
Monies raised by assessments intended for a specific purpose should be used only for that purpose.

5.  Periodic Review. 

The General Assembly should periodically review all assessments to determine if they should be adjusted or 
repealed.

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 2

The  Task  Force  developed  six  recommendations,  in  accordance  with  these  core  principles,  to  address  the 

 
findings summarized above. The recommendations are as follows:  

1.  The Illinois General Assembly should enact a schedule for court assessments that promotes affordability and 

transparency.

The Task Force proposes enactment of the Court Clerk Assessment Act, a statute that will codify in one place 
all court assessments other than those imposed in connection with the disposition of criminal and traffic 
proceedings. The proposed legislation recognizes four classes of civil cases and creates different assessment 
schedules for each class. The Supreme Court would assign each type of civil case to one of the four classes. 
For assessments imposed in connection with the filing of a complaint by a plaintiff or an appearance by a 
defendant, the various permissible assessments are grouped into three categories based on the recipient of 
those funds (the Court Clerk, the County Treasurer, and the State Treasurer), and a maximum assessment 
amount for each category is established. 

Depending on the category or assessment in question, the county board, clerk of court, or Supreme Court 
would be authorized to set the applicable category or fee amount, up to the maximum allowed by the Act. 
Generally speaking, the amount for each category would function akin to a block grant, with the recipient of 
the fees possessing discretion to decide how to allocate those funds among the purposes authorized by the 
Act.

While the Court Clerk Assessment Act would not create uniform assessments throughout the State - a goal 
that the Task Force has concluded cannot realistically be achieved in the immediate future - the Act would 
reduce  variations  across  counties  and  would  significantly  improve  the  simplicity  and  transparency  of  the 
imposition, collection, and distribution of assessments in civil proceedings. 

2.  The  General  Assembly  and  the  Supreme  Court  should  authorize  amendments  to  the  current  civil  fee  waiver 
statute and related Supreme Court Rule, respectively, to provide financial relief from assessments in civil cases 
to Illinois residents living in or near poverty. 

The  Task  Force  proposes  expansion  of  the  existing  civil  fee  waiver  statute.  The  current  statute  uses  the 
federal poverty level as a benchmark, providing automatic waivers to individuals living under 125% of the 
federal  poverty  level  or  otherwise  qualifying  for  public  benefits  tied  to  poverty.  The  Task  Force  proposes 
expanding waivers of assessments in civil cases by creating a sliding scale waiver that offers a partial waiver 
of assessments to individuals earning between 125% and 200% of the federal poverty level. 

The  Task  Force  also  recommends  providing  for  periodic  review  of  assessment  waivers  and  giving  judges 
authority to reconsider or revoke waivers. That authority will combat potential fraud in obtaining assessment 
waivers and will enable judges to better tailor partial or complete waivers to individual needs as they may 
vary over time. 

These amendments to the civil fee waiver statute would be implemented by corresponding amendments to 
the applicable Supreme Court Rule.

3.  The General Assembly should authorize a uniform assessment schedule for criminal and traffic case types that 

is consistent throughout the state.

The Task Force proposes enactment of the Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act, a statute that would codify in 
one  place  all  of  the  current  assessments  imposed  in  connection  with  the  disposition  of  traffic  or  criminal 
charges. Much like the proposed Court Clerk Assessment Act, the legislature would establish fees for various 
classes of cases (the Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act would create 12 such classes) and the Supreme Court 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 3

would assign each type of case to the appropriate schedule based on the nature of the alleged offense. Unlike 
assessments  under  the  Court  Clerk  Assessment  Act,  however,  assessments  imposed  under  the  Criminal/
Traffic  Assessment  Act  would  be  uniform  statewide,  and  counties  and  circuit  clerks  would  play  no  role  in 
setting the amounts of those assessments.

4.  The General Assembly and the Supreme Court should authorize the waiver or reduction of assessments, but not 

judicial fines, imposed on criminal defendants living in or near poverty. 

The Task Force proposes the enactment of an assessment waiver statute for criminal cases similar to that 
recommended  for  civil  proceedings.  Implemented  by  Supreme  Court  Rule,  the  waivers  would  not  include 
assessments  pertaining  to  alleged  violations  of  the  Illinois  Vehicle  Code  or  punitive  fines  or  restitution 
ordered by the court.

5.  The General Assembly and the Supreme Court should modify the process by which fines for minor traffic offenses 

are calculated under Supreme Court Rule 529.

Current Supreme Court Rule 529 provides that, upon a plea of guilty to a minor traffic violation not requiring 
a court appearance, all fines, penalties, and costs are to be set equal to bail. The Task Force proposes severing 
the link between bail and fine amounts. Instead, the Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act proposed by the Task 
Force fixes the total assessment at $150 in all minor traffic cases in which the defendant chooses to plead 
guilty without coming to court.

6.  The General Assembly should routinely consult a checklist of important considerations before proposing new 

assessments, and should periodically consult the checklist in reviewing existing assessments.

The Task Force has developed a checklist to guide legislators in (1) developing or reviewing new assessment 
proposals, and (2) periodically reviewing existing assessments to determine whether they should be modified 
or repealed. The checklist is intended to help ensure that the improvements produced by the Task Force’s 
other recommendations are not eroded over time and that future assessments decisions are well-considered, 
consistent, and transparent.

II. 

History of the Task Force

This Report is the result of one year of intensive study and analysis by the Statutory Court Fee Task Force 
(“Task  Force”)  –  a  statutorily  created  body  with  bipartisan  representation  from  all  three  branches  of  Illinois 
government. The Access to Justice Act1 created the Task Force to conduct a thorough review of the various statutory 
fees and fines imposed on civil litigants and on defendants in criminal and traffic proceedings. The Task Force was 
directed  to  submit  this  Report,  containing  its  findings  and  recommendations,  to  the  General  Assembly  and  the 
Supreme Court by June 1, 2016. 

The  15  members  of  the  Task  Force  were  appointed  as  follows:  one  each  by  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of 
Representatives, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, and the Minority 
Leader of the Senate; two by the Governor; two by the Illinois Association of Court Clerks; and one by each of the 
seven Justices of the Illinois Supreme Court. The resulting group included judges, retired judges, legislators, circuit 
clerks, and members of the private bar from across the state.

The first meeting of the Task Force was held on June 23, 2015, and members met every month thereafter. 
Civil and criminal/traffic subcommittees were created to focus on issues unique to those kinds of court proceedings. 
The civil subcommittee was chaired by Judge James L. Kaplan and the criminal/traffic subcommittee was chaired 
by Circuit Clerk Katherine M. Keefe. The subcommittees met frequently, often several times a month, and developed 
recommendations that were reviewed and revised by the full Task Force.

III. 

Introduction

Eight hundred years ago, the drafters of the Magna Carta recognized the importance of even-handed access to 
justice when they proclaimed “to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.” This theme has echoed throughout 
American history, from the provisions in the Bill of Rights protecting the right to jury trial, the right to counsel, and 
the prohibition against excessive fines, to the declaration in the Illinois Constitution that every person “shall obtain 
justice by law, freely, completely, and promptly.”3

Today,  Illinois  is  facing  a  serious  threat  to  this  fundamental  right  of  equal  access  to  justice.  Skyrocketing 
filing fees in civil cases and a host of fees, costs, and fines in criminal and traffic proceedings are pricing our most 
vulnerable citizens out of full participation in the court system and imposing excessive financial burdens on all who 
do participate. This undermines the legitimacy of the court system, both actual and perceived, and its capacity to 
disseminate fair and equal justice to all.

Historically, court fees were intended simply to offset a portion of the cost of the services being provided.4 
Recognizing  that  the  court  system  benefitted  all  members  of  society,  a  majority  of  funding  came  from  taxpayer 
revenue. Today, civil litigants and defendants in criminal and traffic proceedings still pay fees designed to cover the 
costs  associated  with  administering  their  cases.  However,  they  are  now  required  to  cover  many  additional  costs, 
including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  associated  with  court  security,  law  libraries,  and  children’s  waiting  rooms,  as 
well  as  programs  completely  unrelated  to  the  administration  of  justice  like  roadside  memorials  and  after-school 
programs. Over the years, more and more costs have been passed on to court patrons through an elaborate web of 
fees and fines that are next to impossible to decipher and severely lacking in uniformity and transparency. 

This Report explores in depth the shortcomings of the current system and its impact on Illinois citizens. The 

Report concludes with a series of recommendations to address those problems.

A Note about the Scope of This Report

This  Report  focuses  exclusively  on  the  assessments  charged  to  litigants  in  the  Illinois  circuit  courts  by 
 
circuit clerks or judges. It does not address the imposition of similar costs in non-judicial administrative hearings. 
Administrative  hearings  in  Illinois  take  place  in  many  different  administrative  bodies  pursuant  to  the  Illinois 
Administrative  Procedure  Act  (5  ILCS  100/).  Such  hearings  are  administered  by  independent  quasi-judicial  bodies 
and  operate  outside  of  the  state  court  system.  Illinois  residents  appearing  in  front  of  administrative  law  hearing 
officers  may  encounter  similar  financial  challenges  and  barriers  to  those  appearing  in  the  circuit  courts  as  many 
municipalities, in particular, are increasingly using administrative hearings to collect revenue from residents. While it 
often appears to the public that administrative hearings are a part of the court system, the fines, fees, or other costs 
collected through administrative hearings are not used to fund the court system, are outside the control of the state 
judiciary, and are beyond the scope of this Report.

IV.  Definitions

Assessments include all fees, costs, and other charges imposed on (a) parties to civil cases and (b) defendants 
 
in  criminal  and  traffic  proceedings,  with  the  exception  of  fines  that  are  ordered  by  a  judge  as  punishment  in  the 
exercise of his or her discretion. 

Fees  are  charges  imposed  on  a  party  to  reimburse  the  cost  of  a  specific  court  activity  or  program.  Fees 
 
are  intended  to  support  the  operational  costs  of  the  justice  system  as  a  whole,  in  addition  to  reimbursing 
costs  related  to  litigation,  supervision,  or  incarceration  in  a  particular  case.  The  Illinois  Supreme  Court 
has  held  that  some  charges  labeled  as  “fees”  truly  function  as  taxes  because  “…a  charge  having  no

are  fixed  amounts  that  are  included  in  what  this  Report  terms  “assessments.”  Discretionary  fines  may  be

Court Assessments:  An Overview

The  process  by  which  court  assessments  are  calculated  has  become  more  complex  over  time.  What  was 
once a simple dollar amount directly related to the cost of processing the case before the court has become a much 
more complicated calculation that can involve hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars divvied up among dozens 
of recipients. The following discussion describes the process by which court assessments are proposed, authorized, 
and  ultimately  assessed  against  litigants.  The  first  two  sections  will  describe  the  composition  of  civil  and 
criminal  assessments,  respectively.  The  last  section  will  explain  the  process  by  which  assessments  are  proposed 
and authorized. 

Civil Assessments

To  participate 

 
in  civil 
litigation, each party must first pay 
the applicable court assessments. 
While  the  total  amount  can  vary 
widely  –  by  both  case  type  and 
the  county  in  which  the  case  is 
pending – each county follows the 
same basic formula in calculating 
civil assessments. 

 

As  shown 

 
in  Figure  1, 
an  assessment  in  a  civil  case  is 
actually  a  composite  of  many 
different  categories  of  fees,  each 
one  intended  to  defray  the  cost 
of a different aspect of the court’s 
operations.  A  civil  assessment  is 
akin  to  a  recipe  that  combines  a 
number  of  ingredients.  The  first 
ingredient  is  the  filing  fee  for 
plaintiffs  or  the  appearance  fee 
for defendants. The base filing fee 
or  appearance  fee  is  intended  to 
reimburse  the  court  for  the  cost 
of  adding  one  more  case  to  the 
docket. This fee currently varies in 
amount  depending  on  case  type 
and  county  size  and  forms  the 
baseline cost to which everything 
else is added.7

Figure 1

7 The base filing/appearance fees are labeled as a “Clerk Filing Fee,” in 705 ILCS 105/27.1a 2. However, these fees are directed to the county’s 
general revenue fund, not the Circuit Clerk. 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 10

If  either  party  elects  to 
request  a  jury  trial,  that  party 
incurs  a  jury  demand  fee.  Next, 
a  number  of  court  add-on  fees 
are  added  to  the  mix  (e.g.,  court 
automation or document storage). 
The  revenue  collected  from  the 
court  add-on  fees  is  used  to  fund 
court operations. 

Local  and  state  add-on 
fees  are  the  final  ingredients.  The 
local  add-on  fees  cover  services 
that  are  specific  to  a  particular 
jurisdiction  (e.g.,  a  law  library  fee 
or  children’s  waiting  room  fee  if 
the  local  courthouse  has  one), 
while  the  state  add-on  fees  cover 
broader  services  (e.g.,  Access  to 
Justice Fee). The revenue collected 
from  local  fees  stay  in  the  county 
where the case is heard, while the 
money collected from state fees go 
to  the  state.  Some  of  these  add-
on  fees  are  mandated  by  law  in 
all  counties  and  case  types,  but 
others are discretionary and, when 
imposed,  vary  in  amount  from 
county to county. 

It  should  be  noted  that  most 
fees  are  collected  twice  in  each 
civil  case,  once  from  the  plaintiff/
petitioner  and  once 
from  the 
defendant/respondent if he or she 
chooses to participate.

Figure 2

To understand how this works, consider the following example taken from a recent case involving a married 
couple in Will County who were seeking to dissolve their marriage. As shown in Figure 2, the petitioner paid a $190 
base filing fee, $55 in court fees ($15 Court Automation Fund, $15 Document Storage Fund, and $25 Court Security 
Fee), $8 in state fees ($8 Mandatory Arbitration Fee), and $48 in local fees ($25 Judicial Facilities Fee, $13 Law Library 
Fee, $5 County Fund to Finance the Court, and $5 Neutral Site Custody Exchange). Once all of the extra court fees and 
state and local add-ons are calculated, the initial $190 base fee increased by almost 60%, to a total of $301. 

The respondent in the Will County proceeding paid a total of $186 to participate in the lawsuit. The $186 in 
court assessments consists of a $75 appearance fee and the same court, state, and local add-on fees paid by the 
petitioner ($55 court add-on fees, $8 state add-on fees, and $48 local add-on fees). While the base appearance fee is 
only $75, the amount paid by the respondent more than doubled once the entire assessment was calculated.

Similar  to  a  civil  litigant’s 
assessments,  a  criminal  defen-
dant’s assessments are calculated 
by  adding  a  variety  of  state  and 
local charges to the baseline filing 
fee.  Because  fines  also  must  be 
considered on the criminal side, the recipe for calculating criminal and traffic assessments involves more ingredients. 
The recipe is harder to generalize than that for assessments in civil cases because there is far more variance, both 
from  county  to  country  and  from  case  type  to  case  type.  Nevertheless,  it  is  still  useful  to  examine  the  core  costs 
included in the assessments imposed in criminal and traffic cases.

Figure 3

As shown in Figure 3, the first ingredient in calculating criminal court assessments is the base fee which is 
paid by the criminal defendant and varies by offense and county population size. Payment of the base fee essentially 
requires a criminal defendant to subsidize the prosecution’s costs in bringing the case against him or her. Next, the 
defendant is charged the same court fees that civil litigants are assessed in every courthouse across the state (e.g., 
court security and document storage). Depending on the jurisdiction and case type, the defendant may also have to 
pay fees to cover the cost of attorneys involved in the case, including both the costs of the public defender’s office 

8 Illinois law caps the amount of a discretionary fine at $25,000 for a felony; $2,500 for a Class A misdemeanor; and $1,500 for all 
other misdemeanors. See 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4.5-50(b), 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4.5-55(e), 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-4.5-60(e).

county (some the same as the local add-ons for civil cases, some unique to criminal proceedings), and are usually 
relatively  small  in  size  but  large  in  number.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  a  traffic  or  criminal  defendant  to  be  charged 
dozens of these “minor” fines which can, in the aggregate, create a significant financial burden. The number of fines

Children’s  Advocacy  Centers,  Drug  Court,  Driver  Education,  Spinal  Cord  Research,  and  Roadside  Memorial  Funds, 
among others). All told, the assessments totaled $1,625, increasing the base filing fee of $75 by more than 2,000%. 
The total assessments were more than ten times the $150 judge-ordered fine. This example highlights the disconnect 
that can occur between the discretionary fine ordered by a judge as punishment and the fixed costs – ostensibly not 
intended to punish – which are unrelated to the specific offense and set by statute.

 
On  top  of  the  judicial  fine  and  court  assessments,  the  defendant  will  also  be  charged  for  mandatory  DUI 
treatment, a program which routinely costs several thousands of dollars. Similar requirements exist for defendants 
convicted on Domestic Violence charges. Some criminal charges also add on a surcharge, an additional cost calculated 
as a percentage of the fine, at the end of the case. For example, the Criminal and Traffic Surcharge provides that a 
court may assess an additional $15 fine for every $40 in fines assessed, or a 37.5% surcharge, against a defendant 
as part of the punishment. It is not uncommon for a criminal defendant to leave court with total expenses in the 
thousands of dollars.

As  these  examples  demonstrate,  under  the  current  system  court  fees  are  complicated  to  understand  and 
 
calculate. The final cost assessed against a litigant often bears little or no relation to the actual cost of the court in 
administering the case. This Report will explain in more detail what the consequences of the current system are and 
how they negatively impact court users and the courts, before proposing a number of recommendations to address 
these issues. 

Legislative Process for Creating New Fees and Fines

Any county, branch of government, agency, or special interest group can lobby a legislator to sponsor a bill 
that would add a new cost to be assessed against civil litigants, traffic or criminal defendants, or both. All such bills 
must include a provision for distributing the revenue to the appropriate county, agency, or special interest group 
after it is paid by the litigants and collected by the court.

As illustrated in Figure 5, court assessments originate as bills which must be passed by the General Assembly 
and signed by the governor. Many bills then require the additional step of a county ordinance before the assessment 
can be collected. Statutory fines, however, do not require local approval; the law itself typically sets out to which 
entity the fine is remitted. Once the new law authorizing the fee or fine goes into effect, the clerk (for fees) or the 
judge (for fines) is tasked with assessing the cost against all applicable litigants.

Consider, for example, the new Judicial Facilities Fees enacted in 2015.13 The Judicial Facilities Fee allows 
two counties – Will and Kane Counties – to assess a fee of up to $30 in all civil matters at the time of filing and in 
criminal and traffic matters at the time of conviction if the defendant appeared in court. The fee is intended to help 
fund the construction of new judicial facilities. At the time of this writing, Will County is the only county that has 
enacted a Judicial Facilities Fee, approving a $25 fee in all civil and criminal proceedings.14 While the current statutory 
authority restricts the application of a Judicial Facilities Fee to those two counties, there is little reason to believe the 
collection of a Judicial Facilities Fee will be limited to Will or Kane Counties. In fact, in this legislative session alone, 
there  are  two  pending  bills  in  the  General  Assembly  that  would  allow  Montgomery  County  15 and  Lake  County16, 
respectively, to have the authority to impose a Judicial Facilities Fee not to exceed $30.

Figure 6

As these examples show, there is no one entity responsible for proposing and administering court fees. Nor is 
there one statute that lays out all of the existing fees. Instead, dozens of different agencies have proposed fees that 
are codified in dozens of different statutes – which has allowed filing fees to take on broader and broader purposes 
that are less directly related to litigation and court administration. The next section of the Report will discuss this 
practice in greater detail and the impact that it has on court patrons.

VI.  Court Assessments:  Four Key Findings

After  a  yearlong  study,  the  Task  Force  made  four  key  findings  regarding  the  current  system  of  imposing, 
collecting,  and  disbursing  court  assessments.  The  current  system  charges  litigants  an  increasing  number  of 
assessments that are imposed in a manner that is opaque and inconsistent. The end result places an undue burden 
on litigants, impedes access to justice for civil litigants and reentry into society for criminal defendants, creates an 
administrative nightmare for court clerks responsible for collecting and disbursing assessments, and erodes public 
confidence in the judicial system. 

The four key findings are as follows:

1.  The nature and purpose of assessments have changed over time, leading to a byzantine system that attempts to 

pass an increased share of the cost of court administration onto the parties to court proceedings.

2.  Court fines and fees are constantly increasing and are outpacing inflation. 

3.  There is excessive variation across the state in the amount of assessments for the same type of proceedings.

4.  The  cumulative  impact  of  the  assessments  imposed  on  parties  to  civil  lawsuits  and  defendants  in  criminal 
and  traffic  proceedings  imposes  severe  and  disproportionate  impacts  on  low-  and  moderate-income  Illinois 
residents. 

Each of these findings is discussed below.

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 16

Finding  #1:    The  nature  and  purpose  of  assessments  have  changed  over  time,  leading  to  a 
byzantine system that attempts to pass an increased share of the cost of court administration 
onto the parties to court proceedings.

Most litigants are unaware that their court costs are comprised of a number of fees intended to fund a variety 
of  services  and  projects.  With  growing  frequency,  counties  are  passing  the  costs  of  operating  their  court  systems 
on to parties to civil cases and defendants in criminal and traffic cases. A complex network of add-on fees intended 
to fund specific programs and special interests, often increasing the final cost to court users exponentially, is now 
added to the baseline filing fees that were initially designed to reimburse a court for the cost of adding one more case 
to its docket. Courts are increasingly treated as revenue generators – and litigants by extension as revenue providers. 

Civil Proceedings

Many assessments in civil cases are not true user fees, but instead function as taxes levied against civil litigants 
to fund public welfare programs for the general good.17 For example, many counties charge all civil litigants a fee to 
fund the children’s waiting room. It does not matter if the litigant has young children, or if those children use the 
waiting room. Instead, the fee, like many others, acts as a tax imposed on all civil litigants alike, regardless of their 
level of interaction with the court system.18 Because these court assessments are generally bundled together and 
presented to the litigant as one lump sum, there is no transparency and it is extremely difficult for litigants to know 
what it is they have just “purchased” with their court assessments. Many litigants would presumably be shocked to 
learn what a small percentage of their court assessments are actually used to fund the cost of administering their 
case. 

As state and local budgets have become tighter over the years, circuit courts have increasingly turned to their 
“customer base” of litigants to raise funds for their own operations. Consider the Judicial Facilities Fees described 
above. This new fee, assesssed against litigants in Will County, is intended to raise funds “for the sole purpose of 
funding in whole or in part the costs associated with building new judicial facilities within the county.”19 This is a 
prime example of the legislature attempting to “shift some of the costs of facility expansion from property taxes to 
user fees.”20 Furthermore, there is no sunset date for the fee, so it could, theoretically, be assessed indefinitely, even 
after the new courthouse is built.21 

17 See Crocker v. Finley, 99 Ill. 2d 444, 452 (1984)(“court charges imposed on a litigant are fees if assessed to defray the expenses of his litigation. 
On the other hand, a charge having no relation to the services rendered, assessed to provide general revenue rather than compensation, is a tax.”)

Criminal/Traffic Proceedings

On the criminal and traffic side, defendants routinely face dozens of fees and fines that fund any number 
of  programs.  Assessments  fund  special  interest  projects  ranging  from  providing  bridge  loans  to  burn  victims,22  to 
offering zero-interest loans to local fire departments for new fire trucks,23 to supporting spinal cord injury research.24 
While many of these add-on court assessments are small in size – only a few dollars each – the collective impact 
can  be  staggering,  especially  to  indigent  defendants.  In  addition,  the  burden  imposed  by  this  proliferation  of 
assessments extends to court clerks and others responsible for distributing the revenues generated by these add-
ons to the designated recipients.

For  example,  a  defendant  recently  convicted  of  Driving  Under  the  Influence  (DUI)  in  McLean  County  paid 
court assessments to be distributed to 25 separate funds for varying local, county, and state purposes. As Figure 6 
explains, of the $1,752 collected from that defendant, only $135 (8%) was actually used to reimburse the court for 
specific  costs  associated  with  the  case  and  general  overhead.  That  means  over  90%  of  the  total  assessment  was 
earmarked for programs and services that were unrelated to the pending litigation. 

At  the  county  level,  $163.63  goes  to  cover  other  county  expenses  associated  with  the  criminal  justice 
system  including  county  jail  medical  costs,  probation  services,  and  a  state’s  attorney  records  automation  fund, 
among other services and costs. The bulk of the money, $1,101.37, is distributed to the state to fund services and 
programs  including  the  Illinois  State  Police,  maintance  of  the  Law  Enforcement  Agencies  Data  System  (LEADS), 
trauma  centers,  fire  truck  safety,  and  roadside  memorials.  One  of  the  newest  such  costs  assessed  to  convicted 
DUI defendants is called the George Bailey Memorial Fund, whose proceeds are to be used to provide burn victims 
with  less  than  18  months  to  live  with  a  loan  equal  to  five  months  of  Social  Security  Disability  payments  that 
the  burn  victim  will  receive  from  the  Social  Security  Office  after  a  five-month  waiting  period.25  Finally,  the 
municipality  where  the  defendant  was  prosecuted  receives  $352  of  the  total  amount  for  the  arresting  agency 
to defray its costs.

None of the foregoing is intended to question the value of the various funded programs to society at large. 
However, many, if not most, of the programs have an attenuated connection to a DUI conviction or even the criminal 
justice system. In this DUI example (and countless others), there must be a mechanism to ensure that the system does 
not impose unreasonable financial obligations to fund other governmental services, and that court assessments are 
not simply an alternate and hidden form of taxation.

Relying on litigants to fund court operations and programs with little or no connection with the courts has led 
to significant increases in court assessments. As a policy matter, there is growing concern that mounting assessments 
in  civil  cases  threatens  the  viability  of  the  courts  as  an  economically  feasible  method  for  dispute  resolution.  For 
defendants  in  traffic  or  criminal  proceedings,  the  financial  repercussions  associated  with  assessments  are  often 
disproportionate to the offense and to the fine that is intended to constitute the appropriate punishment. 

Civil Proceedings

 
On  the  civil  side,  the  steady  trend  of 
rising  court  assessments  is  exemplified  by 
the  maximum  filing  fee  authorized  for  large 
counties  (like  Will  or  Kane).  Figure  7  reveals 
that this fee has grown by approximately 80% 
since  2000.  At  the  other  end  of  the  litigation 
spectrum, consider a small claims action with 
an amount in controversy of $450. Small claims 
actions are intended to be relatively straightforward and easy methods for resolving minor disputes like failure to 
return a security deposit or to fix a car correctly. In 2015, in DeKalb County, it cost $118 to file the case as a plaintiff, 
and $113 to respond as a defendant. In 2016, only one year later, the cost had increased to $148 to file the case as a 
plaintiff and $143 to respond. While the $30 increases may not seem significant, they constitute increases in excess 
of 25% in the span of a single year. The total payment to the court by the parties equals $291, which could very well 
eclipse the value of the amount in controversy.

Figure 7

This trend shows no signs of abating. In September 2015, an amendment to 
 
the Access to Justice Act authorized an additional $2 fee to be collected from every 
litigant, civil and criminal, to finance legal services for veterans and active duty service 
members.26  In  the  2015-2016  legislative  session  that  followed,  at  least  eight  bills 
were introduced proposing new assessments or increases to the maximum amount 
collectable  under  existing  laws.  The  civil  side  saw  two  counties  seeking  a  Judicial 
Facilities Fee of up to $30, plus proposals for a statewide $9 EBusiness27 fee and a $15 
Juror Services28 fee. If all these bills are enacted, in the coming year all civil litigants 
could see at least a $24 increase in initial filing fees; and civil litigants in Montgomery 
and Lake counties could see an increase of up to $54. 

Some existing assessments have also recently been increased. For example, 
 
the  Bureau  County  Board  recently  approved  a  resolution  to  increase  the  Court 
Security  Fee  charged  to  every  litigant  from  $25  to  $75.29 This  three-fold  increase  is 
allowed under the state law which caps court security fees at $25 unless the county 
requesting the increase conducts an “acceptable cost study.”30

The growth in the number and amount of assessments has been even steeper on the criminal side. Consider 
the example of DUI convictions. Under the current system, statutory maximums are set by population size. As shown 
in Figure 9, the maximum amount in large counties has grown by more than 300 percent since 2000, with much of 
that growth happening within the past five years. Taking the example of a defendant convicted of a DUI in DuPage 
County,  from  1995  to  2015,  the  number  of  add-on  fees  increased  from  nine  to  27.  The  amount  of  those  fees  also 
increased – from $300 to $2,172. That is an increase of more than 600% in just 20 years. Furthermore, as Figure 10 
demonstrates, DuPage County is not an outlier. This same kind of growth is happening in every county throughout 
the state.

 Criminal/Traffic Proceedings

   

 

 
It  should  also  be  recognized 
that,  in  addition  to  court  assessments,  court 
users  may  incur  other  significant  costs  in 
connection  with  judicial  proceedings.  Such 
“hidden”  costs  may  relate  to  transportation 
to  and  from  court,  parking,  time  off  work, 
and  child  care  obligations.  In  addition,  court-
ordered fees may be incurred after the filing of 
a civil action or sentencing in a criminal action, 
such  as  fees  for  service  of  process,  court-
ordered  mediation,  court-ordered  parenting 
classes, or probation costs. Defendants found 
guilty of a DUI or domestic battery are required 
to  pay  for  treatment  which  can  cost  several 
thousand  dollars.  And  of  course,  litigants 
who can afford to retain an attorney can incur 
significant additional expense if they choose to 
do so. 

 
The cumulative amount of assessments 
and  hidden  costs  undermines  the  economic 
viability of civil litigation and the reasonableness 
of  the  economic  burdens  associated  with 
criminal and traffic proceedings. In light of the 
fact that the benefits derived from the efficient 
administration  of  justice  are  not  limited  to 
the  parties  to  court  proceedings,  there  must 
be a recalibration of the balance between the 
growing  desire  for  additional  government 
revenue and the cumulative cost of litigation.

Finding #3:  There is excessive variation across the state in the amount of assessments for the 
same type of proceedings.

We have previously explained how counties play a large role in setting the amount of court assessments. The 
price for county discretion, however, is a lack of statewide uniformity. County control over what rates to charge and 
which add-on fees to collect has led to wildly different court assessments and fines throughout the state for the same 
type of civil, traffic, or criminal proceedings. 

Civil Proceedings

By  statute,  the  baseline  filing  and  appearance 
fees are tied to county size, so a litigant in a county 
with  a  larger  population  will  pay  higher  fees  than 
a  litigant  in  a  county  with  a  smaller  population. 
Many  of  the  other  components  of  a  total  filing  fee 
are  authorized  by  county  boards  at  varying  levels 
across  the  state,  producing  a  pronounced  lack  of 
uniformity. 

Figures  11-14  demonstrate  at  a  glance  the 
vastly  different  financial  obligations  imposed  on 
litigants  depending  on  their  location.  In  Illinois, 
two  parties  wishing  to  dissolve  their  marriage  will 
face substantially different financial burdens based 
on  nothing  more  than  the  county  in  which  they 
happen to file their case. To see how this plays out 
in practice, we will examine the costs recently faced 
by  three  married  couples  seeking  to  dissolve  their 
marriages  in  Knox  County,  Will  County,  and  Cook 
County, respectively. 

 
Figure  11  shows  that,  relatively  speaking, 
the  Knox  County  couple  received  a  bargain,  paying 
only $280 in combined court costs to dissolve their 
marriage (the petitioner initiating the case will pay 
$165 and the respondent will pay $115). In contrast, 
as  Figure  13  shows,  the  Will  County  couple  paid 
a  combined  $487  in  court  costs  to  dissolve  their 
marriage  ($301  from  the  petitioner  and  $186  from 
the  respondent).  The  Will  County  petitioner’s  filing 
fees  of  $301  are  almost  twice  the  amount  charged 
to  the  Knox  County  petitioner  to  initiate  the  exact 
same case. 

Figure 11

Finally,  consider  the  financial  burden  faced 
by  the  Cook  County  couple.  As  the  most  populous 
county in the state, Cook County is also the most expensive for many types of litigation. Figure 14 shows that the 
dissolution case cost the Cook County petitioner and respondent $342 and $206, respectively, or a combined $548 in 
court assessments. Cook County also has the highest concentration of residents living in or near poverty of anywhere 
in the state. A potential petitioner who could barely afford the $165 fee to initiate a case in Knox County may have to 
think twice, or pass altogether, before initiating the same case in Cook County.

These examples are endemic of the landscape of civil assessments across Illinois. Figure 15 summarizes how 
the base filing and appearance fees in marriage dissolution cases vary from county to county, even before any of the 
court and local add-ons are thrown into the mix. The steps involved in the case, however, are the same in all counties 
(petition, service, response, financial investigation, trial). The judicial salaries are also the same. Yet we see huge 
disparities in assessments that are exacerbated as more counties use local add-on fees as a source of revenue. 

Criminal/Traffic Proceedings

This  large  variation  between  counties  regarding  the  amount  of  assessments  imposed  in  the  same  kind  of 

cases is not unique to civil actions and, in fact, is more pronounced in criminal cases. As in the civil context, counties 

have some discretion over which charges to assess, and the size of those charges. This local discretion precludes 

uniformity and means that criminal defendants facing the exact same charges can have very different assessments 

imposed on them, depending on the county in which the case is heard.

this  variability.

respect  to  defendants  who  received  a  $150  fine  for

the  defendants  fees  to  subsidize  the  cost  of  court 

automation,  document  storage,  and  court  security. 

Both  counties  also  charged  the  defendants  a  fee 

for  the  state’s  attorney’s  office  that  prosecuted  the

assessments  imposed  by  the  two  counties  relates 

to  the  local  and  state  add-on  fees.  While  Macoupin 

County  added  seven  state  and  local  fees  totaling 

$197, McLean County added 15 state and local fees 

totaling  $1560.  The  $75  base  fee  of  the  McLean 

County  defendant  thereby  increased  by  more  than 

2,400%  and  that  defendant  paid  nearly  five  times 

more  than  the  Macoupin  County  defendant  for  the

Finding #4:  The cumulative impact of the assessments imposed on parties to civil lawsuits 
and  defendants  in  criminal  and  traffic  proceedings  imposes  severe  and  disproportionate 
impacts on low- and moderate-income Illinois residents. 

 
The  rapid  rise  of  court  assessments  has 
caused  financial  and  other  hardships  which  are 
low-
disproportionately  borne  by  modest  and 
income  litigants.  In  the  criminal  courts,  where  there 
is currently no formal process in place for waiving or 
reducing fees, an indigent defendant may be forced to 
decide  between  paying  court  debt  or  covering  basic 
living expenses like rent and medical bills. In the case 
of civil litigation, high filing fees may force financially 
insecure  litigants  to  opt  out  of  participation  in 
important civil cases altogether. 

 
The  2016  Federal  Poverty  Guidelines  set  the 
poverty  threshold  at  an  annual  income  of  $11,880 
for a family of one and $24,300 for a family of four.31 
In  2014,  14.4%  of  Illinois  residents  lived  below  the 
poverty  line.32  Yet  another  17.2%  of  the  population, 
over  2  million  individuals,  lived  between  100%  and 
200% of the federal poverty threshold.33 Between 1997 
and 2011, the share of working families in Illinois living 
at  or  below  200%  of  the  federal  poverty  guideline 
increased  by  5%,  one  of  the  largest  increases  in  the 
nation.34  The  increased  number  of  working  poor  can 
be seen in courthouses across the country on a daily 
basis  as  the  number  of  litigants  appearing  without 
attorneys continues to rise.35 These litigants, already 
struggling to navigate a complex and confusing legal 
system  during  times  of  crisis,  often  face  hundreds 
of  dollars  in  court  fees  simply  to  participate  in  the 
process. 

Illinois  has  taken  modest  steps  to  address  this 
growing  problem.  Under  Illinois  Supreme  Court  Rule 
298 and ILCS 735 ILCS 5/5-105, civil courts will consider 
fee  waiver  applications  from  indigent  civil  litigants, 
defined  as 
federal 
benefits  or  earning  less  than  125%  of  the  federal 

individuals  receiving  certain

Nearly  one-third  of  Illinois  residents  are  living  in  or  near  poverty.

poverty level set annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. While the civil fee waiver 
provision has been an important and much needed first step in promoting equal access to the courts, the current rule 
still excludes far too many people, including all criminal defendants (including those who would have qualified for 
a civil fee waiver) and the rapidly growing class of Illinois residents who can be described as the working poor. Many 
of those individuals and families earn too much to qualify for the extremely low poverty cutoffs used by most legal 
aid and pro bono programs, but earn too little to pay hefty court fees without suffering serious financial hardship.

In  2015,  as  exemplified  in  the  discussion  above,  the  initial  filing  fees  for  a  dissolution  of  marriage  case  in 
Illinois ranged from $165 in Knox County to $342 in Cook County. For an individual living on only $1,250 a month, 
for  example,  these  court  fees  can  present  an  insurmountable  barrier  to  accessing  the  court  system.  Despite  the 
obvious financial challenges, that same individual would not qualify for a fee waiver, a reduction in court costs, or 
for assistance from a legal aid organization or pro bono program that uses the standard 125% federal poverty level 
cutoff. Furthermore, while the poorest civil litigants currently receive some relief from the rising court fees, there is 
no analogous provision for criminal fee waivers. Rule 298 does not extend to indigent criminal defendants, who may 
qualify for free legal representation through the public defender’s office but still find themselves hundreds or even 
thousands of dollars in debt at the conclusion of the case. 

Criminal court fees can have the unintended and counterproductive consequence of burdening a criminal 
defendant’s  reentry  into  society  and  increasing  the  potential  for  recidivism.36  Court-imposed  fees  impact  credit 
scores, making it difficult for criminal defendants to rent or purchase homes. Unpaid fees also interfere with efforts to 
expunge or seal criminal records, which can in turn lead to termination from employment or additional hurdles that 
must be cleared to secure new employment. On top of that, a criminal defendant may risk suspension of their driver’s 
license if they cannot afford to pay the fees, further burdening their ability to reintegrate into society and return to 
school or work. Without stable housing, employment, and transportation, a formerly incarcerated individual may 
return to criminal activity to cover their expenses, including crippling court debt. 37 Furthermore, these fees do not 
take into account the punitive criminal fines that may attach at the end of criminal litigation and create additional 
financial burdens. 

A relatively small percentage of assessments imposed in criminal cases is ever collected. Compared to any 
revenue that they generate, the administrative burden that such assessments impose on court clerks is substantial 
because criminal cases are not closed if assessments have not been paid.

VII.  Core Principles

In developing proposed legislation and court rules to address the problems identified in the findings discussed 
in the preceding section of this Report, the Task Force was guided by the following core principles. The Task Force 
appreciates the tension between some of these principles and the realities of government, the state of the Illinois 
economy, and the difficulty of effecting change that in certain respects may require a culture shift. Accordingly, these 
core principles can be viewed as guideposts that the Task Force hopes will direct reasoned and constructive thinking 
towards renewed balance among competing interests bearing on the system of court assessments in our state.

1.  Role of Assessments in Funding the Courts. Courts should be substantially funded from general government 
revenue sources. Court users may be required to pay reasonable assessments to offset a portion of the cost 
of the courts borne by the public-at-large.

2.  Relationship Between Assessments and Access to the Courts. The amount of assessments should not impede 
access to the courts and should be waived, to the extent possible, for indigent litigants and the working poor.

3.  Transparency and Uniformity. Assessments should be simple, easy to understand, and uniform to the extent 

possible.

4.  Relationship Between Assessments and Their Underlying Rationale. Assessments should be directly related 
to the operation of the court system. Assessments imposed for a particular purpose should be limited to the 
types  of court proceedings that are related  to  that purpose. Monies raised by assessments intended for  a 
specific purpose should be used only for that purpose.

5.  Periodic  Review.  The  General  Assembly  should  periodically  review  all  assessments  to  determine  if  they 

should be adjusted or repealed.

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 32

VIII.  Recommendations

Civil Proceedings

1.  The General Assembly should authorize an assessment schedule for civil cases that promotes 

affordability and transparency.

The  Task  Force  proposes  simplifying  and  streamlining  the  current  system  by  creating  a  new  Court  Clerk 
Assessment  Act  that  replaces  all  statutory  fees  currently  scattered  throughout  the  Illinois  Compiled  Statutes.  Set 
forth  in  Appendix  A  to  this  Report,  the  Act  contains  four  assessment  schedules,  each  with  a  maximum  filing  fee, 
appearance fee, and other authorized fees. The Supreme Court would assign each case type to one of the assessment 
schedules. 

Each of the filing fees and appearance fees authorized under the new Act would be broken down into three 
components:  the  Court  Fee;  the  County  Fee;  and  the  State  Fee.  The  Act  provides  discretion  to  set  the  amount  of 
each of those three fees, within the overall limits for the filing fee and appearance fee established by the Act for the 
applicable  assessment  schedule.  The  Act  also  provides  discretion  to  allocate  the  Court  Fee,  the  County  Fee,  and 
the  State  Fee  among  the  different  purposes  authorized  by  the  Act.  In  that  way,  assessments  would  generally  no 
longer be earmarked by state law for special funds or projects, but would instead be collected akin to a block grant 
that would afford counties broader discretion regarding the purposes for which assessments are collected and the 
amount devoted to each of those purposes.

The  Task  Force  recommends  that  the  amounts  set  forth  in  the  Act  serve  as  maximums,  rather  than  fixed 
amounts,  thereby  authorizing  the  counties  to  charge  less  if  they  wish  to  do  so.  While  the  Task  Force  appreciates 
that  uniformity  is  an  important  goal,  it  also  recognizes  that  affordability  is  an  equally  important  one  and  cannot 
recommend requiring counties to charge more than they need for no reason other than consistency. 

The proposed Court Clerk Assessment Act also includes some assessments – such as fees for copying court 

records, providing certified copies, and mailing documents – that are not limited to civil actions.

2.  The General Assembly and the Supreme Court should authorize amendments to the current civil fee 
waiver  statute  and  related  Supreme  Court  Rule  to  provide  financial  relief  from  assessments  in  civil 
cases to Illinois residents living in or near poverty. 

The Task Force proposes broadening the current fee waiver statute and related Supreme Court Rule by adding 
a sliding scale fee waiver based on income. Litigants whose income is 125% or less of the current poverty level, or 
who are otherwise eligible for fee waivers under existing law, would continue to be eligible for full waivers.  Litigants 
whose income is between 125% and 200% of the poverty level would be eligible for waivers on a sliding scale ranging 
from 75% to 25%. This will extend financial protections already offered to indigent civil litigants to the working poor. 

Clean and redlined versions of the proposed civil fee waiver statute, with the redlining identifying amendments 
to the current fee waiver statute, are contained in Appendix B to this Report.  Clean and redlined versions of Supreme 
Court Rule 298, the rule concerning fee waivers in civil cases, are contained in Appendix C.

Fee  waivers  will  not  eliminate  all  of  the  financial  burdens  and  other  obstacles  faced  by  litigants  trying  to 
participate fully in the justice system. Many litigants will still struggle to take time off from work, secure child care, 
and  pay  for  transportation  to  and  parking  at  the  courthouse.  However,  waiving  or  reducing  fees  for  the  poorest 
litigants is a logical step forward in aspiring to ensure that all Illinois residents can access the court system in a fair 
and equitable manner, and that no one is forced to choose between being able to participate in court proceedings 
and pay their basic living expenses. 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 33

The Task Force also proposes expanding a judge’s discretion to reconsider the fee waiver prior to the final 
disposition of the case if the judge has reason to believe the litigant was not entitled to the initial fee waiver or if 
there has been change in circumstances such that the litigant is able to pay fees going forward. Additionally, the Task 
Force proposes that the fee waiver expires after one year, but can be renewed upon a showing of continued eligibility.

Criminal/Traffic Proceedings

3.  The  General Assembly should authorize a uniform assessment schedule for criminal and traffic case 

types that is consistent throughout the state.

The  Task  Force  proposes  creating  a  new  criminal  assessment  schedule  system  to  promote  uniformity, 
consistency, and a reasonable connection between the assessment and the crime. Contained in Appendix D to this 
Report,  the  proposed  Criminal/Traffic  Assessment  Act  would  codify  in  one  statute  all  of  the  court  fees  and  fines 
imposed  at  the  conclusion  of  those  proceedings.  Every  offense  would  be  assigned  to  a  particular  assessment 
schedule. Every court in the state would follow the same schedule. 

This proposal would make the process of calculating fees and fines more transparent – all of the costs would 
be clearly explained in one place rather than the current piecemeal system where they are buried in dozens of pieces 
of legislation. This would also create statewide consistency. 

Additionally, the Task Force recommends eliminating some currently authorized court assessments to reduce 
the overall financial burden imposed on defendants and ensure that existing assessments have an appropriate nexus 
to the crime so that a defendant is not paying for something unrelated to the offense. 

4.  The General Assembly and the Supreme Court should authorize the waiver or reduction of assessments, 

but not fines, imposed on criminal defendants living in or near poverty. 

The Task Force proposes creation of a criminal assessment waiver statute with a sliding scale that would be 
similar to the proposed amendment to the civil fee waiver statute. The statute would be complemented by a Supreme 
Court Rule analogous to the rule that implements the civil fee waiver statute. The proposed criminal assessment 
waiver statute and Supreme Court Rule 404 are contained in Appendices E and F, respectively, of this Report.

The proposed statute and rule would extend the financial protections offered to indigent civil litigants to their 
counterparts in the criminal justice system. The criminal assessment waiver would cover all assessments authorized 
by the new Criminal/Traffic Assesment Act, but would not cover punitive fines or restitution ordered by a judge. This 
would ensure that criminal defendants still face meaningful punishment if convicted. It would also encourage judges 
to tailor punishments to more carefully fit the crime by using their discretionary powers to assess fines based on the 
nature of the crime committed, rather than simply letting court assessments act as punitive fines. 

While criminal defendants should face meaningful punishment for committing a crime, it is unjust and unwise 
to burden indigent criminal defendants with court assessments that are beyond their ability to pay and that create 
a disproportionate and counterproductive barrier to their reentry into society. Rather than levy such assessments, 
which  also  impose  administrative  burdens  on  court  clerks  that  are  unwarranted  by  the  potential  amounts  to  be 
collected, it is preferable to allow judges to grant waivers. Such waivers would facilitate judges’ ability to impose 
fines (that, unlike fees, are designed to punish) at amounts that are commensurate with the crime. Moreover, unlike 
assessments, in appropriate cases judges can authorize fines to be worked off through community service or similar 
programs.

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 34

5.  The General Assembly and the Supreme Court should modify the process by which minor traffic offense 

fines are calculated under Supreme Court Rule 529.

Current Supreme Court Rule 529 provides that all fines, penalties, and costs are to be set equal to bail upon a 
plea of guilty to a minor traffic violation not requiring a court appearance. Since the early 1980s, the General Assembly 
has enacted many new user fees and surcharges on minor traffic violations. This has reduced the amount of revenue 
for counties and local law enforcement agencies since the total ticket fines, penalties, and costs are fixed (tied to 
bail), but the ticket revenue is now shared with many additional public bodies. The Supreme Court has responded by 
increasing bail, which helps with counties and local law enforcement agencies, but creates tension with the objective 
of setting bail at the minimum amount necessary to ensure the defendant’s appearance at trial.

To address this tension, the Task Force proposes severing the link between the amount of bail and the fine in 
minor traffic cases. Instead, Schedule 12 of the proposed Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act (Appx. D hereto), sets the 
amount of fines, penalties and costs at a uniform amount of $150. Related proposed revisions to Supreme Court Rule 
529 are contained in Appendix G.

General Recommendations

6.  The Illinois General Assembly should routinely consult a checklist of important considerations before 
proposing  new  assessments,  and  should  periodically  consult  the  checklist  in  reviewing  existing 
assessments.

To  support  the  consolidation  of  all  assessments  in  a  single  act  and  in  an  effort  to  alleviate  some  of  the 
confusion in implementing certain assessments, the Task Force proposes a Checklist for Review of New Assessment 
Legislation for the General Assembly to consult before creating new assessments. Contained in Appendix H to this 
Report, the checklist is intended to guide the General Assembly in ensuring that: any new assessment is added to the 
correct part of the statute; implementation dates are consistent; the statute clearly describes the recipients of the 
new assessment; the triggering event for collecting the assessment is clear; and the statute clearly states whether 
the new assessment impacts the total value of a schedule or whether it modifies distribution of the existing amount.

IX.  Conclusion

This  report  documents  pervasive  and  fundamental  problems  with  the  imposition  of  court  assessments  in 
judicial proceedings in our state. Implementation of the recommendations developed by the Task Force is urgently 
needed to address the barriers to access to justice and excessive financial burdens associated with court assessments 
that are undermining the court system’s ability to provide fair and equal justice for all.

(ii)  His  or  her  available  income  is  125%  or  less  of  the  current  poverty  level,  unless  the  applicant’s 
assets that are not exempt under Part 9 or 10 of Article XII of this Code are of a nature and value that the court 
determines that the applicant is able to pay the assessments, costs, and charges.

(iii) He or she is, in the discretion of the court, unable to proceed in an action without payment of assessments, 
costs, and charges and whose payment of those assessments, costs, and charges would result in substantial

  (iv) He or she is an indigent person pursuant to Section 5-105.5 of this Code.

(3) “Poverty level” means the current poverty level as established by the United States Department of Health 

and Human Services. 

(b) On the application of any person, before or after the commencement of an action:

(1) If the court finds that the applicant is an indigent person, the applicant shall be granted a full assessment 

waiver entitling him or her to sue or defend the action without payment of any assessments, costs, or charges.

(2) If the court finds that the applicant satisfies any of the criteria contained in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii), the 
applicant shall be granted a partial assessment waiver entitling him or her to sue or defend the action upon payment 
of the applicable percentage of the assessments, costs, and charges of the action, as follows:

(i) 75% of all assessments, costs, and charges shall be waived if the applicant’s available income is

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 47

(iii) 25% of all assessments, costs and charges shall be waived if his or her available income is between

Human Services, unless the applicant’s assets that are not exempt under Part 9 or 10 of Article XII of this Code 
are such that the applicant is able, without undue hardship, to pay a greater portion of such assessments, 
costs, and charges.

(c) An Application for Waiver of Court Assessments shall be in writing and signed by the applicant, or, if the applicant

Court Rule 298. The court shall provide, through the office of the clerk of the court, the Application for Waiver of Court 
Assessments to any person seeking to sue or defend an action who indicates an inability to pay the assessments, 
costs, and charges of the action. The clerk of the court shall post in a conspicuous place in the courthouse a notice 
no smaller than 8.5 x 11 inches, using no smaller than 30-point typeface printed in English and in Spanish, advising 
the public that they may ask the court for permission to sue or defend a civil action without payment of assessments, 
costs, and charges. The notice shall be substantially as follows:

“If you are unable to pay the assessments, costs, and charges of an action you may ask the court to allow you 
to proceed without paying them. Ask the clerk of the court for forms.”

(d) The clerk of the court shall not refuse to accept and file any complaint, appearance, or other paper presented 
by  the  applicant  if  accompanied  by  an  Application  for  Waiver  of  Court  Assessments,  and  those  papers  shall  be 
considered filed on the date the application is presented. If the application is denied or a partial assessment waiver 
is  granted,  the  order  shall  state  a  date  certain  by  which  the  necessary  assessments,  costs,  and  charges  must  be 
paid. For good cause shown, the court may allow an applicant who receives a partial assessment waiver to defer 
payment of assessments, costs, and charges, make installment payments, or make payment upon reasonable terms 
and conditions stated in the order. The court may dismiss the claims or strike the defenses of any party failing to pay 
the assessments, costs, or charges within the time and in the manner ordered by the court. (e)A judicial ruling on an 
Application for Waiver of Court Assessments shall not be considered to constitute a decision of a substantial issue in 
the case under 735 ILCS 5/1001.

(f) The order granting a full or partial assessment waiver shall expire after one year. Upon expiration of the assessment 
waiver,  or  a  reasonable  period  of  time  before  expiration,  the  party  whose  assessments,  costs,  and  charges  were 
previously  waived  may  file  another  Application  for  Waiver  of  Court  Assessments  and  the  court  shall  consider  the 
Application in accordance with the applicable Supreme Court Rule.  

(g) If, before or at the time of final disposition of the case, the court obtains information, including information from 
the court file, suggesting that a person whose assessments, costs, and charges were initially waived was not entitled 
to a full or partial assessment waiver at the time of application the court may require the person to appear at a court 
hearing by giving the applicant no less than 10 days’ written notice of the hearing and the specific reasons why the 
initial assessment waiver might be reconsidered. The court may require the applicant to provide reasonably available 
evidence, including financial information, to support his or her eligibility for the assessment waiver, but shall not 
require submission of information that is unrelated to the criteria for eligibility and application requirements set forth 
in subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2), above. If the court finds that the person was not initially entitled to any assessment 
waiver, the person shall pay all assessments, costs and charges relating to the civil action including any previously 
waived assessments, costs, and charges. The order may state terms of payment in accordance with subsection (e). 
The court shall not conduct a hearing pursuant to this subsection more often than once every six months.

(h) If, before or at the time of final disposition of the case, the court obtains information, including information from 
the court file, suggesting that a person who received a full or partial assessment waiver has experienced a change 
in  financial  condition  so  that  he  or  she  is  no  longer  eligible  for  that  waiver,  the  court  may  require  the  person  to 
appear at a court hearing by giving the applicant no less than 10 days’ written notice of the hearing and the specific 
reasons why the assessment waiver might be reconsidered. The court may require the person to provide reasonably 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 48

available  evidence,  including  financial  information,  to  support  his  or  her  continued  eligibility  for  the  assessment 
waiver, but shall not require submission of information that is unrelated to the criteria for eligibility and application 
requirements set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), above. If the court enters an order finding that the person is 
no longer entitled to an assessment waiver, or is henceforth entitled to a partial assessment waiver different than 
that which they had previously received, the person shall pay the requisite assessments, costs, and charges from the 
date of the order going forward. The order may state terms of payment in accordance with subsection (e). The court 
shall not conduct a hearing pursuant to this subsection more often than once every six months. 

(i) A court, in its discretion, may appoint counsel to represent an indigent person, and that counsel shall perform his 
or her duties without fees, charges, or reward. 

(j) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect the right of a party to sue or defend an action in forma pauperis 
without  the  payment  of  assessments,  costs,  or  charges,  or  the  right  of  a  party  to  court-appointed  counsel,  as 
authorized by any other provision of law or by the rules of the Illinois Supreme Court. Nothing in this Section shall be 
construed to limit the authority of a court to order another party to action to pay the assessments, costs, or charges 
of the action. 

(k) In any case where a party is represented by a civil legal services provider or an attorney in a court-sponsored pro 
bono program as defined in 735 ILCS 5/5-105.5, the attorney representing that party shall file a certification with the 
court in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 298 and that party shall be allowed to sue or defend without payment

court determines that the applicant is able to pay the assessments, costs, and charges.

(iii) He or she is, in the discretion of the court, unable to proceed in an action without payment of 
assessments, costs, and charges and whose payment of those assessments, costs, and charges would result

  (iv) He or she is an indigent person pursuant to Section 5-105.5 of this Code.

(3) “Poverty level” means the current poverty level as established by the United States Department of

(1) If the court finds that the applicant is an indigent person, the applicant shall be granted a full 
assessment waiver entitling him or her to sue or defend the action without payment of any assessments, costs, or 
charges.

(2) If the court finds that the applicant satisfies any of the criteria contained in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii),

payment of the applicable percentage of the assessments, costs, and charges of the action, as follows:

assessments, costs, and charges.

(c)  An  Application  for  Waiver  of  Court  Assessments  shall  be  in  writing  and  signed  by  the  applicant,  or,  if  the 
applicant is a minor or an incompetent adult, by another person having knowledge of the facts. The contents of 
the Application for Waiver of Court Assessments, and the procedure for decision of such Applications, shall be 
established by Supreme Court Rule 298. The court shall provide, through the office of the clerk of the court, the 
Application for Waiver of Court Assessments to any person seeking to sue or defend an action who indicates an 
inability to pay the assessments, costs, and charges of the action. The clerk of the court shall post in a conspicuous 
place in the courthouse a notice no smaller than 8.5 x 11 inches, using no smaller than 30-point typeface printed 
in English and in Spanish, advising the public that they may ask the court for permission to sue or defend a civil 
action without payment of assessments, costs, and charges. The notice shall be substantially as follows:“If you 
are unable to pay the assessments, costs, and charges of an action you may ask the court to allow you to proceed 
without paying them. Ask the clerk of the court for forms.”

(d) The clerk of the court shall not refuse to accept and file any complaint, appearance, or other paper presented 
by the applicant if accompanied by an Application for Waiver of Court Assessments, and those papers shall be 
considered  filed  on  the  date  the  application  is  presented.  If  the  application  is  denied  or  a  partial  assessment 
waiver is granted, the order shall state a date certain by which the necessary assessments, costs, and charges 
must be paid. For good cause shown, the court may allow an applicant who receives a partial assessment waiver 
to  defer  payment  of  assessments,  costs,  and  charges,  make  installment  payments,  or  make  payment  upon 
reasonable  terms and conditions stated  in  the  order. The  court  may  dismiss the claims or strike the  defenses 
of any party failing to pay the assessments, costs, or charges within the time and in the manner ordered by the 
court. (e)A judicial ruling on an Application for Waiver of Court Assessments shall not be considered to constitute 
a decision of a substantial issue in the case under 735 ILCS 5/1001.

(f)  The  order  granting  a  full  or  partial  assessment  waiver  shall  expire  after  one  year.  Upon  expiration  of  the 
assessment waiver, or a reasonable period of time before expiration, the party whose assessments, costs, and 
charges were previously waived may file another Application for Waiver of Court Assessments and the court shall 
consider the Application in accordance with the applicable Supreme Court Rule.  

(g) If, before or at the time of final disposition of the case, the court obtains information, including information 
from the court file, suggesting that a person whose assessments, costs, and charges were initially waived was 
not entitled to a full or partial assessment waiver at the time of application the court may require the person 
to appear at a court hearing by giving the applicant no less than 10 days’ written notice of the hearing and the 
specific reasons why the initial assessment waiver might be reconsidered. The court may require the applicant 
to provide reasonably available evidence, including financial information, to support his or her eligibility for the 
assessment waiver, but shall not require submission of information that is unrelated to the criteria for eligibility 
and application requirements set forth in subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2), above. If the court finds that the person was 
not initially entitled to any assessment waiver, the person shall pay all assessments, costs and charges relating 
to the civil action including any previously waived assessments, costs, and charges. The order may state terms 
of payment in accordance with subsection (e). The court shall not conduct a hearing pursuant to this subsection 
more often than once every six months.

(h) If, before or at the time of final disposition of the case, the court obtains information, including information 
from the court file, suggesting that a person who received a full or partial assessment waiver has experienced 
a change in financial condition so that he or she is no longer eligible for that waiver, the court may require the 
person to appear at a court hearing by giving the applicant no less than 10 days’ written notice of the hearing 
and the specific reasons why the assessment waiver might be reconsidered. The court may require the person to 
provide reasonably available evidence, including financial information, to support his or her continued eligibility 
for the assessment waiver, but shall not require submission of information that is unrelated to the criteria for 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 51

eligibility  and  application  requirements  set  forth  in  subsections  (b)(1)  and  (b)(2),  above.  If  the  court  enters  an 
order finding that the person is no longer entitled to an assessment waiver, or is henceforth entitled to a partial 
assessment  waiver  different  than  that  which  they  had  previously  received,  the  person  shall  pay  the  requisite 
assessments, costs, and charges from the date of the order going forward. The order may state terms of payment 
in accordance with subsection (e). The court shall not conduct a hearing pursuant to this subsection more often 
than once every six months. 

(i) A court, in its discretion, may appoint counsel to represent an indigent person, and that counsel shall perform 
his or her duties without fees, charges, or reward. 

(j)  Nothing  in  this  Section  shall  be  construed  to  affect  the  right  of  a  party  to  sue  or  defend  an  action  in  forma 
pauperis without the payment of assessments, costs, or charges, or the right of a party to court-appointed counsel, 
as authorized by any other provision of law or by the rules of the Illinois Supreme Court. Nothing in this Section 
shall be construed to limit the authority of a court to order another party to action to pay the assessments, costs, 
or charges of the action. 

(k) In any case where a party is represented by a civil legal services provider or an attorney in a court-sponsored 
pro bono program as defined in 735 ILCS 5/5-105.5, the attorney representing that party shall file a certification 
with the court in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 298 and that party shall be allowed to sue or defend without 
payment of assessments, costs, or charges without necessity of an Application.

(l) If an attorney files an appearance on behalf of a person whose assessments, costs, and charges were initially 
waived pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/5-105, the attorney must pay all assessments, costs, and charges relating to the civil 
action, including any previously waived assessments, costs, and charges, unless the attorney is either a civil legal 
services provider, representing their client pro bono as defined in 735 ILCS 5/5-105.5, or appearing pursuant to a 
Limited Scope Appearance in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 13(c)(6).

(m) The provisions of this Section are severable under Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 75

Proposed Criminal Assessment Waiver Statute, 720 ILCS 5/3-9

Sec. 3-9. Leave to defend as an indigent person. 

    (a) As used in this Section: 

        (1) “Assessments” means any costs imposed on a criminal defendant pursuant to Schedules 1-9 of the Criminal/
Traffic Assessment Act.  

  (2) “Indigent person” means any person who meets one or more of the following criteria:

(i) He or she is receiving assistance under one or more of the following means based governmental public 
benefits  programs:  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI);  Aid  to  the  Aged,  Blind  and  Disabled  (AABD);  Temporary 
Assistance  for  Needy  Families  (TANF);  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (SNAP);  General  Assistance; 
Transitional Assistance; or State Children and Family Assistance.

(ii) His or her available income is 125% or less of the current poverty level as established by the United States 
Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  unless  the  applicant’s  assets  that  are  not  exempt  under  Part  9  or  10 
of Article XII of this Code are of a nature and value that the court determines that the applicant is able to pay the 
assessments.

(iii) He or she is, in the discretion of the court, unable to proceed in an action without payment of assessments 

and whose payment of those assessments would result in substantial hardship to the person or his or her family.

  (3) “Poverty level” means the current poverty level as established by the United States Department of Health 

and Human Services

    (b) On the application of any defendant, after the commencement of an action, but no later than 30 days after 
sentencing: 

(1) If the court finds that the applicant is an indigent person, the applicant shall be granted a full assessment 

 
waiver entitling him or her to sue or defend the action without payment of any assessments.  

 
(2) If the court finds that the applicant satisfies any of the criteria contained in subsections (i) through (iii), 
the applicant shall be granted a partial assessment waiver entitling it to sue or defend the action upon payment of 
the following percentages of the assessments of the action:

 (i) 75% of all assessments shall be waived if the applicant’s available income is 150% of the poverty level, 
unless  the  applicant’s  assets  that  are  not  exempt  under  Part  9  or  10  of  Article  XII  of  this  Code  are  such  that  the 
applicant is able, without undue hardship, to pay the total assessments.

(ii) 50% of all assessments shall be waived if the applicant’s available income is 175% of the poverty level, 
unless the applicant’s assets that are not exempt under Part 9 or 10 of Article XII of this Code are such that the court 
determines that the applicant is able, without undue hardship, to pay a greater portion of the assessments.

(iii) 25% of all assessments shall be waived if the applicant’s available income is 200% of the poverty level, 
unless the applicant’s assets that are not exempt under Part 9 or 10 of Article XII of this Code are such that the court 
determines that the applicant is able, without undue hardship, to pay a greater portion of the assessments.

(c) An  Application for Waiver of Assessments shall be in writing, signed by the defendant or, if the defendant is a 
minor or an incompetent adult, by another person having knowledge of the facts, and filed no later than 30 days 
after sentencing. The contents of the Application for Waiver of Court Assessments, and the procedure for decision 
of such Applications, shall be established by Supreme Court Rule. The court shall provide, through the office of the 

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 76

clerk of the court, the Application for Waiver of Assessments to any person seeking to defend an action who indicates 
an  inability  to  pay  the  assessments.  The  clerk  of  the  court  shall  post  in  a  conspicuous  place  in  the  courthouse  a 
notice no smaller than 8.5 x 11 inches, using no smaller than 30-point typeface printed in English and in Spanish, 
advising the public that they may ask the court for permission to defend a criminal action without payment of the 
assessments. The notice shall be substantially as follows: 

“If you are unable to pay the required assessments you may ask the court to allow you to proceed without 

 
paying them. Ask the clerk of the court for forms.”    

(d) For good cause shown, the court may allow an applicant whose application is denied or who receives a partial 
assessment  waiver  to  defer  payment  of  the  assessments,  make  installment  payments,  or  make  payment  upon 
reasonable terms and conditions stated in the order. 

    (e) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to affect the right of a party to defend an action in forma pauperis 
without the payment of assessments, or the right of a party to court-appointed counsel, as authorized by any other 
provision of law or by the rules of the Illinois Supreme Court. 

    (f) In any case where a party is represented by a criminal legal services provider or attorney in a court-sponsored 
pro bono program as defined in 735 ILCS 5/5-105.5, the attorney representing that party shall file a certification with 
the court as established by Supreme Court Rule 404 and that party shall be allowed to defend without payment of 
assessments without necessity of an Application.

    (g) The provisions of this Section are severable under Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.

(a) Contents. An Application for Waiver of Court Assessments in a criminal action pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/3-9 shall 
be in writing and signed by the applicant or, if the applicant is a minor or an incompetent adult, by  another person 
having knowledge of the facts. The application should be submitted no later than 30 days after the entry of judgment.  

(1) The contents of the Application must be sufficient to allow a court to determine whether an applicant 
qualifies for a full or partial waiver of Assessments pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/3-9, and shall include information 
regarding the applicant’s household composition, receipt of need-based public benefits, income, expenses, 
and nonexempt assets.

(2)  The  court  shall  provide  and  applicants  shall  be  required  to  use  a  standardized  form  expressly  titled 
“Application for Waiver of Assessments” adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court Access to Justice Commission.

(b) Ruling. The court shall either enter a ruling on the Application or shall set the     Application for a hearing requiring 
the  applicant  to  appear  in  person.  The  court  may  order  the  applicant  to  produce  copies  of  certain  documents  in 
support of the Application at the hearing. The court’s ruling on an Application for Waiver of Assessments shall be 
made according to standards set forth in 720 ILCS 5/3-9. If the Application is denied, the court shall enter an order 
to that effect specifying the reasons for the denial. If the court determines that the conditions for a full assessment 
waiver are satisfied, it shall enter an order permitting the applicant to defend without payment of the assessments. 
If the court determines that the conditions for a partial assessment waiver under 720 ILCS 5/3-9(a)(3) are satisfied, 
it  shall  enter  an  order  permitting  the  applicant  to  sue  or  defend  after  payment  of  a  specified  percentage  of  the 
assessments. If an Application is denied or an Application for a partial assessment waiver is granted, the court may 
allow  the  applicant  to  defer  payment  of  the  assessments,  making  installment  payments,  or  make  payment  upon 
reasonable terms and conditions stated in the order.

(c) Filing. No assessment may be charged for filing an Application for Waiver of Assessments.  The clerk must allow 
an applicant to file an Application for Waiver of Assessments in the court where his case will be heard.

(d)  Cases  involving  representation  by  criminal  legal  services  providers  or  lawyers  in  court-sponsored  pro 
bono program. In any case where a party is represented by a criminal legal services provider or an attorney in a 
court-sponsored pro bono program as defined in 735 ILCS 5/5-105.5, the attorney representing that party shall file 
a  certification  with  the  court  in  the  form  attached  to  this  rule  and  that  party  shall  be  allowed  to  defend  without 
payment of  assessments as defined in 720 ILCS 5/3-9(a)(1) without necessity of an Application under this rule.

Rule  529.    Fines,  Penalties  and  Costs  on  Written  Pleas  of  Guilty  in  Minor 
Traffic and Conservation Offenses

(a) Traffic Offenses. 

(1) All traffic offenses, except those requiring a court appearance under Rule 551 and those involving 
offenses set out in Rule 526(b)(1), may be satisfied without a court appearance by a written plea of guilty, with 
the exception of electronic pleas unless authorized by the Supreme Court, and payment of the amount stated in 
Schedule 12 of the Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act. If an order of failure to appear to answer the charge has been 
entered pursuant to Rule 556(a), an additional assessment of $35 shall be added. The clerk of the circuit court shall 
disburse the amount collected pursuant to statute. 

(2) A charge of violating section 3-401(d), 15-111 or offenses punishable by fine pursuant to sections 
15-113.1, 15-113.2 or 15-113.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (truck overweight and permit moves) (625 ILCS 5/15-111, 
15-113.1 through 15-113.3), or similar municipal ordinances, may be satisfied without a court appearance by a 
written plea of guilty and payment of the minimum fine fixed by statute, plus the amount stated in Schedule 10 of 
the Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act. The clerk of the circuit court shall disburse the amount collected pursuant to 
statute.

(b) Conservation Offenses. All conservation offenses, except those provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), 
(f) and (g) of Rule 527 may be satisfied without a court appearance by a written plea of guilty, with the exception 
of electronic pleas unless authorized by the Supreme Court, and payment of the amount stated in Schedule 10 of 
the Criminal/Traffic Assessment Act. The clerk of the circuit court shall disburse the amount collected pursuant to 
statute. 

(c)  Supervision  on  Written  Pleas  of  Guilty.  In  counties  designated  by  the  Conference  of  Chief  Circuit 
Judges, the circuit court may by rule or order authorize the entry of an order of supervision under section 5-6-
3.1  of  the  Unified  Code  of  Corrections  (730  ILCS  5/5-6-3.1),  for  traffic  offenses  satisfied  pursuant  to  paragraph 
(a)  of  this  Rule  529.  Such  circuit  court  rule  or  order  may  include  but  does  not  require  a  program  by  which  the 
accused, upon payment of the amount stated in Schedule 12, agrees to attend and successfully complete a traffic 
safety program approved by the court under standards set by the Conference. The accused shall be responsible for 
payment of any traffic safety program fees. If the accused fails to file a certificate of successful completion on or 
before the termination date of the supervision order, the supervision shall be summarily revoked and conviction 
entered. Any county designated by the Conference pursuant to this rule may opt-out of this rule upon notification 
to the Conference by the chief judge of the circuit and rescinding any rule or order entered to establish supervision 
on written pleas of guilty.

(d)  The  provisions  of  Supreme  Court  Rule  402  relating  to  pleas  of  guilty  do  not  apply  in  cases  where  a 
defendant enters a guilty plea under this rule. The clerk of the circuit court shall disburse the monies collected as

Appendix H – Recommended Legislative Checklist

STATUTORY COURT FEE TASK FORCE | Illinois Court Assessments | 85

Recommended Checklist for Review of New Assessment Legislation

•	 Ensure that the new assessment’s location in statute is consistent

o  Prior to reform, fees were distributed throughout multiple acts of ILCS. Going forward, they should be 

located in a single Act.

•	 Ensure that all modification to assessments advanced in a legislative session have consistent effective dates

o  Clerks  have  experienced  difficulty  implementing  multiple  new  fees  at  different  points  in  a  year.  Any 

legislation enacted in a session should have the same effective date.

•	 Ensure that the new statute clearly describes assessment distribution

o  Statute should clearly lay out the entities and funds that are to receive the assessment and how it is to 

be collected.

•	 Ensure  that  the  new  statute  clearly  states  the  nature  of  offenses  (in  criminal  schedules)  or  filings  or  other 

activities (in civil cases) applicable to an assessment

•	 State  clearly  whether  the  new  assessment  impacts  the  total  value  of  a  schedule  or  whether  it  modifies 

distribution of the existing amount

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
