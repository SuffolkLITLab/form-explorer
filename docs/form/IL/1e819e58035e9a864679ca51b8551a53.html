      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
   

 
If the court provided the court reporter, ask the 
  
trial court clerk’s office how to contact them. 
 
If the court made an audio or video recording, 
 
ask the trial court clerk's office how to contact 
 
 
the person who will type the Report of 
 
 
Proceedings (Transcripts). 
In some counties, like Cook County, a private 
 
court reporter may have recorded the hearing or 
trial. If you hired a private court reporter, you can 
 
call the court reporter to find out where to deliver 
 
 
your Request for Report of Proceedings 
 
 
(Transcripts). If the other party hired the court 
 
reporter, you should contact that party (or their 
attorney, if they have one) to get the name and 
telephone number of the court reporter. Then 
 
contact the court reporter to find out where to 
 
 
 
deliver your Request for Report of Proceedings 
 
(Transcripts). 
 

 
 
   

 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Even if the other party hired the court reporter, 
 
 
 
 
you must use the Request for Report of 
 
 
Proceedings (Transcripts) form to ask the court 
 
reporter to type the Transcripts. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  When you find out who the court reporter was or 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
who will type the Report of Proceedings 
 
(Transcripts), you need to deliver the Request 
 
 
for Report of Proceedings (Transcripts) to that 
 
person. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

   

 
   
Where can I find the form I need? 
You can find the form at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
 
and-forms/approved-forms. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

 
   

 
How much does it cost when I use the Request for 
 
Report of Proceedings (Transcripts)? 
o  You don’t pay to use this form if you drop off the 
 
 
 
 
Request for Report of Proceedings (Transcripts) 
 
 
yourself. If you deliver the Request for Report of 
 
 
Proceedings (Transcripts) by mail or third-party 
 
 
commercial carrier (e.g., FedEx or UPS), you must 
 
pay postage or delivery fees. In either case, you 
 
must pay the court reporter for the cost of the 
 
transcripts. 
 

o  Court reporters will tell you how much the transcripts 
 
 

 
 
 
 
will cost when you request them.  Most court 
 
 
reporters will require you to pay them at least half of 
  
 
the cost of the transcripts when you request them. 
o  Transcripts can be expensive. However, if you don’t 
 
 

   
 
 
file the Request for Report of Proceedings 
 
(Transcripts), the appellate court may think that the 
 
 
trial court judge made the right decision and you will 
 
 
lose your appeal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
   

 
What is a Request for Report of Proceedings 
 
(Transcripts)? 
 
o  The Report of Proceedings (Transcripts) is a typed 
 
 
record of a hearing or trial. It includes what the 
 
judge, the parties, the witnesses, and the lawyers 
 
said or testified to in court. This typed record is also 
 
called a Transcript. 
 
o  The appellate court must have the Report of 
 
 
 

 
Proceedings (Transcripts) to figure out if the trial 
 
 
court’s decision is right. 
   
If you do not file a Report of Proceedings 
 
 
 
(Transcripts), the appellate court may think that the 
trial court judge made the right decision. 
If the court proceedings were not recorded, see the 
instructions for How to Prepare a Bystander's Report 
 
or Agreed Statement of Facts and related forms at 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
 
forms. 

o 
 

o 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Who can use the Request for Report of Proceedings 
 
(Transcripts) form? 
o  The person who files the appeal (the appellant) must 
 
 

  
make sure the record on appeal is complete. 
o  A complete record on appeal must include a typed 
 

 
 
record of what was said or done in court while it was 
 
in session. This is called the Report of Proceedings 
(Transcripts). 
 
 

o  A court reporter may have recorded the hearing or 
 
 
trial, or the court may have made an audio or video 
 
recording. If there were multiple hearings, a court 
reporter may have recorded some of them and the 
 
court’s audio equipment may have recorded others. 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
What forms do I need to fill out for the Request for 
 
 
Report of Proceedings (Transcripts)? 
o  You need to fill out the Request for Report of 
 
 
 
 

 
Proceedings (Transcripts) if the trial or hearing was 
 
recorded. 
 

o  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
 
address you put on the (Form Name) is where 
 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share 
   
 
with anyone else and that you check every day. If 
 
you do not check your email every day, you may 
 
miss important information and documents from 
 
other parties.

by notification through the e-filing system. If you or

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
