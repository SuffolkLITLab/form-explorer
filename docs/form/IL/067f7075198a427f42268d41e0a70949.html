INTRODUCTION TO GETTING A 
DIVORCE IN ILLINOIS (NO 
 
CHILDREN) 
 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
These instructions apply to marriages and civil unions.  If 
the instructions say: 
 
o  “marriage” it also means “civil union”; AND 
 
o  “spouse” it also means “partner.” 
  
 
Can I ask the court for a divorce in Illinois? 
 
 
You can ask for a divorce if: 
 
o  You are married; 
 
o  You or your spouse has lived in Illinois for at least 90 
 

   

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

days; AND 
 

o  There is no other divorce case already filed and still 

 

pending anywhere else (not dismissed). 
 

 

 

 

NOTE: If your spouse is on active military service, you 
can ask for a divorce, but the court might not be able to 
give you a divorce. 
 
 
What forms do I need to ask the court for a divorce? 
 
Below are some of the common forms used in divorce 
 
cases. Depending on your specific situation, you may 
not need all of the forms listed or you may need other 
forms not listed here. 
 
o  Petition for Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union 
(Divorce No Children): asks the court for a divorce 
 
 
and gives information needed to begin a divorce 
case.

information about your case that is sent to the Illinois 
 
Department of Public Health after your divorce is 
final.

court for a divorce. 
 

 

o  Entry of Appearance: is completed by your spouse 
 
to tell the court that they do not need to receive a

o  Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union 

 

 

(Divorce No Children): is used by the judge to grant 
 
or deny your divorce. If granted, the Judgment will 
also divide property, assign debt, and determine 
whether spousal support will be paid. 
 

 

 

 

The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
you put on the forms is where important legal documents 
will be sent to you. You should use an email account that 
 
you do not share with anyone else and that you check 

 

 

every day. If you do not check your email every day, you 
may miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
documents from other parties.

the Circuit Clerk’s office.

divorce?

the Circuit Court in the county where you are filing 
your divorce.

have used before. 
 

o  The judge cannot allow you to begin using a new 

 

 

o

an email address, you must send them by email or by 
 
notification through the e-filing system. If you or the 
person you’re sending the forms to does not have an

personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party commercial 
carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 
  

 

 

 

o 
 

o 
 

 

 

If your spouse signs an Entry of Appearance, you do 
not have to have your spouse served by the sheriff. 
You are ready to get a court date (skip to "Ask for a 
court date" below). 
 
If your spouse did not sign an Entry of Appearance, 
 
 
then staple the Summons to the front of the copy of 
 
Petition that will go to your spouse.

of your Order for Waiver of Court Fees (if you 
have one) to not be charged a fee. 
 

 

 

 

 

o  By Mail 
 
•  Mail 2 copies of your Summons and your

section of your Summons form and file it with the 
 
Circuit Clerk or mail it to you. 
 
 
If the sheriff files the Summons with the completed 
Return of Service directly with the Circuit Clerk, call 
the Circuit Clerk to find out if it has been filed. If it 
 
has been filed, ask the Circuit Clerk how to get a 
copy.

o 
 

If the sheriff was not able to serve your spouse, ask 
them why. You should try to fix the problem and 
then fill out another Summons and ask the sheriff to 
 
try to serve your spouse again. 
 
 

 

 

Wait for your spouse to file a response with the 
Circuit Clerk. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

o  Once the sheriff serves your forms on your spouse, 
your spouse has 30 days to file an Appearance and 
 
a response with the Circuit Clerk.  
If you do not get a copy of your spouse's 
 
Appearance and response within the 30 days, call 
the Circuit Clerk to ask if there is an Appearance 
 
and response in the file. If there is, ask the Circuit 
Clerk to send you a copy or go to the Circuit Clerk’s 
office to pick it up. 
 
If your spouse files an Appearance and response, 
you may then get a court date from the Circuit Clerk. 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

o  After the 30 days from the date of service, you may 

 

 

get a court date from the Circuit Clerk whether or not 
your spouse filed an Appearance and response. 
 

 
 

 

 

Ask for a court date. 
 

 

 
 

o 
 

o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically. 
 
If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
 
schedule the court date 
or you may have to speak 
with other court staff. 
 
o  When you get your court 
date, ask if the court will 
send notice of the 
hearing to your spouse or 
if you need to. 
 
If you need to send 
 
notice, complete a Notice 
 
of Court Date. 
  

Make sure you know how you are to 
attend your court date. 
 
Your court date could be in person, by phone or by 
 
video. If it is by phone or video it is called a 
“Remote Appearance.” Call the Circuit Clerk or visit 
their website for more information. To find the 
phone number for your Circuit Clerk, visit

STEP 4: WHAT DO I DO AFTER 
 
THE COURT DATE? 
 
 
1. 
 

If you got permission to go back to a former name, 
ask the Circuit Clerk to certify your copy of the 
Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union 
(Divorce No Children).There may be a fee for this. 
 

 

 

 

2.  The Secretary of State and Social Security 

 

Administration will want to see a certified copy of the 
judgment before changing your name in their 
 
records. 

 

 

3.  Keep your copies of all of your court papers in a safe 
place. If you lose any court papers that were filed 
with the Circuit Clerk, you can get another copy 
 
there.  There may be a charge for those copies. 

 

 

 

 

4. 
 

 

 

 

 

In Cook County, and in some other counties, the 
judge may ask you to get a transcript of the court 
hearing from the court reporter for the court file. 
Some judges will not sign your Judgment of 
 
Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union (Divorce No 
 
Children) until you return the transcript to the court. 

 

 

 

   

5. 
 

In Cook County, if the judge orders you to get a 
 
transcript follow these steps: 

 

 

a. 
 

If you have a fee waiver, ask the judge to enter 
an Order for Free Transcript; 
 

 

b.  Call the court reporter’s office at (312) 603-8405 
to make sure the transcript is ready; if you do 
not have the Order for Free Transcript, ask what 
you will be charged for the transcript; 
 

 

Washington St., 9th  Floor, Chicago; you will need 
to bring the Order for Free Transcript or pay the 
transcript fee; AND 

   

c.  When the transcript is ready, pick it up at 69 W. 

 

 

d.  Sign the last page of the transcript and return it 
 
to the judge’s clerk in the courtroom where you 
got the divorce. 
 

6. 
 

In other counties, if the judge orders you to get a 
transcript speak with the Circuit Clerk for more 
 
information about how to do that. 
  

 

 

7.  Send a copy of the Judgment to your spouse either 
 
by hand or by mail and file a Proof of Delivery with 
the Circuit Clerk.  You can find the Proof of Delivery 
 
at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 
 

 

 

 

 

•  Ask the witnesses questions you prepared in 
 

advance. 
 

•  The judge and your spouse can ask questions of 
 

 

your witnesses when you are done. 
 

 

o  The judge decides whether the documents, photos, 
or witness testimony can be considered in making a 
decision about your case. 
 

 

 

 

o  Tell the judge you have brought a Judgment of 
Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union (Divorce No 
 
Children). 
  

What do I do when my spouse presents their case? 
(If your spouse does not appear for the court date, this 
 
part will not happen.) 
 

 

 

o  Your spouse will also get to present their case by 

 

 

 

testifying, giving the judge evidence, and 
questioning witnesses. 
 
 
o  You will get to see any documents and photos your 
spouse brings to court. If you do not think the judge 
should consider them in making a decision about 
your case, tell the judge why. 
 

 

 

o  You may ask questions of your spouse’s witnesses. 
Write down your questions while they are speaking 
to your spouse or judge. 
 

 

 

What happens after both sides present their case? (If 
your spouse does not appear for the court date, this will 
happen after you present your case to the judge.) 
 

 
 

 

o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 

 

 

 

 

 

called the Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage/Civil 
 
Union (Divorce No Children). 
 
If the judge needs more information to make a 
decision, the judge may set up another court date. 
Make sure you understand what information is 
needed and get it before the new court date. 

 

 

 

If the judge needs more time to make a decision, the 
 
judge will let you know the decision later by mailing a 
 
 
court order or at another court date. 

  

 

If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
decide right then and fill out the Judgment of 
Dissolution of Marriage/Civil Union (Divorce No 
 
Children). 
 
•  Get a copy of the Judgment that was entered by 
 

 

o 
 

o 
 

the judge.
