HOW TO ASK FOR AN ORDER OF PROTECTION 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please look at 
 
 
 
the Definitions section at the end of the Petition or visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 

If you are not connected to the Respondent in one of the 
ways listed above, don’t use these forms. Different 
 
 
protection laws may apply where there has been: 
 
 
o  Stalking: illinoislegalaid.org/stalkingnocontact 
o  Sexual Assault: illinoislegalaid.org/civilnocontact 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

What is an Order of Protection? 
 
o  A court order that protects the person who asked for 
 
the Order (the Petitioner) from harm by a person 
 
named in the Order (the Respondent). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

What is the difference between an Emergency Order 
of Protection (EOP) and a Plenary Order of 
 
 
Protection (OP)? 
 
o  Emergency Order of Protection (EOP): 
 
•  The hearing for an EOP may happen 
 
 
 

immediately after filing your Petition.  It takes 
    
effect as soon as the judge approves it. 
 
•  Because of the risk of harm, the law does not 
 
 
 

require Respondent to know about the hearing. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 

 

 

It lasts for 14 to 21 days. When the court issues 
 
 
an EOP, it sets another hearing date for a 
 
 
Plenary Order. 
 

 
   

 

 

•  Ask for an EOP if you want an Order of 
   
 

Protection right now. 

 

 

 

 

 

  

•  NOTE:  Your hearing for the EOP may happen 

 
immediately after filing the Petition. See 
“Prepare for the Court Hearing” on page 3. 
 
 

 
 
 
o  Plenary Order of Protection (OP): 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  After filing your Petition, a future court date may 
be set for you to come back and ask for your 
 
Order. You will not have an Order of Protection 
 
 
until the date of the hearing. 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  The OP may be issued by a judge after the 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent has been notified by the sheriff and 
a hearing with both the Petitioner and the 
Respondent has taken place. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

•  When a Plenary Order is granted, it usually lasts 
 

   

 

 

 
 
for up to 2 years. 

 

 

 

 

•  Ask for an OP if you want to wait until 
 
 

Respondent gets notice and a copy of your 
Petition before you have a court hearing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who can ask the court for an Order of Protection? 
 
 
o  People who have been abused by a family or 
household member, caregiver, current or ex-
 
boyfriend, current or ex-girlfriend, or current or ex-
 
 
spouse, a person with whom you live or used to live, 
 
or someone who is the other parent of your child; 
OR 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  People filing on behalf of any person who has been 
 
 

 

 

abused but is unable to file on their own. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

Who else can be protected by my Order of Protection? 
o  Anyone who lives or works in your house; 
 
 
o  Your minor children, even if they don’t live with you; 
 
o  High risk adults with disabilities; AND 
 
o  Your animals. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

How much will I have to pay to file an Order of
 
Protection and have that Order served (delivered to)
the Respondent? 
 
Nothing.  Filing an Order of Protection case and service 
  
 
to Respondent is free. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What forms do I need to fill out to seek an Order of 
 
 
 
Protection? 
 
o  Petition for Order of Protection: gives the court 
 
information to decide if you can get an Order of 
 
Protection. 
•  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
address you put on the Petition for Order of 
 
Protection is where important legal documents 
will be sent to you. You should use an email 
account that you do not share with anyone else 
 
and that you check every day. If you do not 
check your email every day, you may miss 
important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
documents from other parties. 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

• 

 

 

If you do not want Respondent to know your 
email, you may enter a different email where you 
 
can get Court notices. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 
 

o  Emergency Order of Protection (if requesting an 
 
EOP):  a proposed Emergency Order that will be 
reviewed by the judge during your court hearing. 
The judge may make changes to the Order after you 
 
present your case.  The Order will either be granted 
or denied. 
 

o  Order of Protection:  a proposed Plenary Order 
  
 
 

(long-term) that will be reviewed by the judge during 
your court hearing. The judge may make changes to 
 
the Order after you present your case.  The Order 
 
 
will either be granted or denied. 
 

o  Summons (Protective Orders): A Summons 
 
 

(Protective Orders) tells Respondent that you have 
 
asked for an Order of Protection against them. 
 
o  Letter to the Sheriff: asks the sheriff to deliver the 
 

 
 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Summons to the Respondent. 
 

 

 

o  When you file the Petition, ask the Clerk if you need 

   

to fill out any other forms.

(08/21) 

o  File your forms in person or by mail. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

   

•  Fill out a Certification for Exemption from E-Filing 
 
 
 
found here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
   
forms/approved-forms. 

 

 

•  Take the Certification, originals, and 1 copy of 
 
 
 

 
each of your completed forms to the Circuit Court 
 
 
Clerk’s office.  You may also send them by mail. 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
Step 3: Ask for a court date. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
 
 
 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically. 
o  You have the option to: 
 
 
 

•  request an Emergency Order of Protection to be 
 
 

 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
heard shortly after filing; OR 

 

 

 

 

•  request only a date for the Plenary Order of 
 
 
 

 
 
Protection.  The Respondent will get a copy of 
 
 
the Petition before that date.  No Order of 
 
 
Protection will be in place until that court date. 

 
  

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 
Step 4:  If asking for an Emergency Order of 
 
Protection, attend court hearing. 
o  Your hearing for an Emergency Order of Protection 
 
 
 
may happen immediately after filing.  See “Prepare 
 
 
for the Court Hearing” below. 
 
 
If you are not requesting an Emergency Order of 
 
Protection, skip to step 5. 

o 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Step 5: Ask the Sheriff in the county where
 
 
 
Respondent resides to serve the Summons 
 
 
(Protective Orders) on the Respondent. 
 
The sheriff will serve Respondent with copies of your 
 
 
forms and notice of the court date without charge. 
o  Get the name, address, and telephone number of 
 
 
 
the sheriff for the county or the state where 
 
 
 
Respondent lives. 
• 
 
 

If Respondent lives in the county you are in, the 
 
Circuit Clerk will tell you how to get copies of it 
   
 
 
 
to the sheriff. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

 

 

If Respondent does not live in the same county 
 
 
or state where the case was filed call the Sheriff 
 
 
 
in that county or state to find out: 
 
 if it is the correct sheriff’s Department for the 
 
   
 
address where you want Respondent served 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 the address where you should bring or mail 
 
 

 

 

 
your Summons and forms; and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
o  Bring or mail the following items to the sheriff: 
 
 

 the number of copies of the Summons and 
 
 
 
 
forms to bring or mail. 
 

 
 
•  Letter to the Sheriff; 
 
 
•  A copy Summons stapled to the top of: 
 
 
 

 
 
 A copy of the Petition.  This will need to be a 
 
  
certified copy if the Respondent lives out of 
 
   
county or state. 
  
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
o  You can get printed forms from the Circuit Clerk at 
 
 
 
your local courthouse. 
  

   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Online forms can be found at: 
  
 
 

illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
 
forms. 

 
 

 

 

   

 
 

 
What if I need help filling out my forms? 
o 
 

If you need help with the writing or filing of the 
 
 
Petition, ask the Circuit Clerk for assistance. 
o  Advocates may be available to assist you. If you want 
 
 
 
 
to speak with an advocate, call the Illinois Statewide 
 
Domestic Violence Hotline at 877-863-6338. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  An “easy form” application is available online to help 
 
 
 
you prepare your documents. The program will ask 
 
 
you questions and you will enter your answers. At 
 
 
the end of the program, you will get a completed set 
of court forms with instructions that you can save 
  
 
and print.  This can be found at: 
  
illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/order-protection 
o  You may also ask someone to assist you in filling out 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
  
the forms. 
 

 

 

 

 
   
What do I do after I fill out my forms? 
 
 
 
Step 1: Choose where to file your forms. 
o  File your forms with the Clerk of the Circuit Court in 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the county: 
•  where you live; 
 
 
•  where Respondent lives; 
 
 
•  where the abuse occurred; OR 
 
 
•  where you are staying to avoid abuse. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 2: Choose how to file your forms.  There are 2 
 
 
ways you can file: 
o  Electronically file (e-file) your forms via any 
 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

computer with internet access. To e-file create an 
  
account with an e-filing service provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
  
processing fee. 

 

 

 

 

•  For instructions on how to e-file for free with 
 

 
 
Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help user guides 
 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/how-to-e-file/ 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

 
If you do not have access to a computer, or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public 
 
 
computer terminal to e-file your forms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on a 
 

 

 

 

 

 
flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

  
that you can use to e-file your forms.

Prepare for the Court Hearing 
 
How do I prepare for my court hearing? 
 
 
 
 
Step 1: Decide what you want the Judge to do for 
 
you. 
o  Think about what you will say to the judge if asked to 
 
 
 
 
   
 
tell your side of the case. If an Emergency Order of 
 
 
Protection, tell the judge why you need an Order 
 
 
before the Respondent gets notice of your request. 
o  Gather and make copies of pictures and documents 
 
 
 
 
you want the judge to see such as receipts, text 
 
messages, and photos. Bring the original for the 
 
 
 
judge and one copy for you and Respondent (if 
  
present). 

   
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court: 
 
•  Copies of all the documents you filed with the 
 

 

 

 
Circuit Clerk; AND 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Any witnesses and questions you have for them 
 
 
•  Other evidence you have to show that your story 
 
 
is true, such as receipts, text messages, and 
 
photos. 
  
 

o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
 
 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
 
 
 

form. If your forms do not have a courtroom number 
 
 
 
   
look for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the 
 
 
 
Circuit Clerk. 
   
 
 
 

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 
 

o  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 
 

name and case number to be called. 
 
 
introduce yourself. 
 
If your court date is by phone or video: 
 
 
 
•  Make sure to have the call-in or login information 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for your court date and make sure your 
 
technology is working. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

•  Follow the instructions on the court notice you 
 
 
 

received. Call the Circuit Clerk or Circuit Court or 
 
visit their websites for specific technology 
 
 
instructions.

The Court Hearing 
 
 
Must all parties be present in the court hearing? 
 
 
o  Emergency OP Hearings:  The Petitioner must be 
 
 
present. The Respondent does not need to know 
 
 
about or be at the hearing. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

o  Plenary Hearings:  The Petitioner must be present 
 
 
in court to get the Order.  The Respondent needs to 
  
know about the hearing. 
   
 
• 
 

If Respondent does not come to court, the judge 
 
 
may grant the Petitioner a Plenary Order of 
 
 
 
 
Protection. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

If Respondent comes to court, Respondent may 
 
 
 
 
agree to an Order or may ask for a hearing. 
 

 
•  The judge can either hold the hearing 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

immediately, or give you or Respondent more 
 

time to try to find a lawyer or 
 
gather evidence 
 
 
What if the sheriff could 
not deliver the Summons 
 
to the Respondent before 
 
the Plenary hearing? 
 
 
o 
The judge may ask if 
 
 
you know a better address 
 
where the sheriff can deliver 
 
the papers and court notice. 
 
o 
 
Emergency Order of Protection, the judge may 
 
extend it and give you a court date to return. The 
sheriff will again try to give notice of the Order to 
 
 
Respondent. 
 
If the sheriff can’t find Respondent to deliver the 
 
papers, you can ask the judge to allow service by 
 
publication in a newspaper. 
 

If you have an 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 
How do I present my case to the Judge? 
 
 
o  Tell the judge your side of the case and answer 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

questions. 
 
 

o  Use evidence including documents and photos. 
 
 

 

 

•  Give a copy to the judge. Be prepared to explain 
 

 

 

why the document or photo is important. 
 
 

 

 

 
o  Question witnesses. 
 
 
 

 

•  Tell the judge the name of your witnesses. 
  
 
•  Ask the witnesses questions you prepared before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

the hearing. 
 

•  The judge and Respondent, if present, may ask 
 
 

   

 

 

questions of you and your witnesses. 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

Make sure you know how you are to 
 
attend your court date. 
Your court date could be in person, by phone or 
 
 
 
by video. If it is by phone or video it is called a 
     
“Remote Appearance.” Call the Circuit Clerk or 
 
 
visit their website for more information. To find 
the phone number for your Circuit Clerk, visit

court-clerks/ 
  

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Prepare questions for witnesses. 
 
 
If you want the judge to hear 
 
from other people, those people 
will have to come to court and 
be witnesses (in most cases, 
 
you cannot bring in written 
statements of witnesses) 
 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 
Step 2: Go to your court hearing.

What do I do when Respondent presents their case? 
 
o 
If present, Respondent will also get to present their 
 
 
 
 
case by testifying, giving the judge evidence, and 
 
questioning witnesses. 
  
o  You will get to see any documents and photos 
 
 
 
 
 

Respondent brings to court. If you do not think the 
judge should consider them in making a decision 
 
about your case, tell the judge why. 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You may ask questions of Respondent and their 
 
 
 
 

 
witnesses. Write down your questions while they are 
 
speaking to Respondent or judge. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 
Will a decision be made at my hearing? 
 
 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 
 
 

   

 
called a court order. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  After the hearing, the judge will either GRANT or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
DENY your request. 
 
o  Emergency OP Hearings: 
 

 

• 
 

• 
 

• 
 

• 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
If granted, An Emergency Order will be entered 
and start as soon as Respondent is notified by 
 
law enforcement. You will receive a copy of the 
 
Order.  This Order can last up to 21 days. 
 
Another court date will be scheduled for a hearing 
on the Plenary Order of Protection. 
 
 
If denied, you will not get an Order of Protection 
 
 
and the case will be over. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the judge decides there is no emergency, but 
 
 
you may need an Order, they will schedule 
 
another court date for a hearing to decide 
 
 
whether you will get a Plenary Order of 
 
 
Protection. This means that you do not have an 
 
 
 
Order of Protection yet. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you were not granted an Emergency Order of 
 
Protection and DO NOT want the Respondent to 
 
be served, you can cancel your Petition. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

o  Plenary OP Hearings: 
 
 
If granted, the Order has to be given to 
Respondent. 
  
•  Ask the Circuit Clerk who will give the Order 
 
 
 
to Respondent.  If Respondent does not 
 
come to court, Respondent must be served 
 
with the Order. To serve Respondent, follow 
 
 
the instructions under Step 4 (What do I do 
 
 
after I fill out my forms?) above. 
  
 
•  Read through the Order to make sure 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
nothing is wrong or missing. 
 

 
•  Always keep a copy of the Order with you. 
 
 
 
•  Give copies of the Order to anyone else who 
 
should have it, such as your workplace, 
 
child’s school, childcare provider, or local 
 
police department. 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

If Respondent violates any part of the Order, 
 
 
 
 
call the police immediately. 
 
 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

If denied, you will not get an Order of Protection 
 
 
and the case will be over.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
