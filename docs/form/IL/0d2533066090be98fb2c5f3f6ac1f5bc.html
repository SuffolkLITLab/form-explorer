HOW TO PREPARE AND SEND AN ANSWER TO 
 
 
COMPLAINT FOR FORFEITURE 
  
 
(NOT INVOLVING DRUGS OR MONEY LAUNDERING) 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What is an Answer to Complaint for Forfeiture (Not 
 
Involving Drugs or Money Laundering)? 
o 

It is your written response to the claims in the 
Plaintiff's Complaint. The Plaintiff is the State of 
Illinois and is named first in the court papers. 
o  The Complaint is the document that the State filed 
and served upon you with the Summons. The 
Complaint explains the reasons the State is seeking 
forfeiture of your property. 
 

o  Your Answer tells the court whether you agree or 
disagree with the State's reasons for seeking 
forfeiture of your property. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Is there a deadline for filing an Answer? 
Yes. The Summons you received will tell you the 
deadline for filing your Answer. You must also file an 
 
 
Appearance (Civil Asset Forfeiture). For instructions on 
 
how to file your Appearance see How to File an 
 
Appearance in a Civil Asset Forfeiture Case at 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
o  Your Answer is usually due at the same time as your 
 
 
 
Appearance. 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The Summons might give you a specific time frame 
 
 
for filing your Answer. For example, within 7 or 30 
days of when you received the Plaintiff's Complaint. 

 

 

 

o  The Summons and Complaint will also tell you to 
 
appear in court at a specific date and time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NOTE: If you have a legal reason to challenge the way 
 
you received the Summons and Complaint (service of 
process), or a legal reason to have the Complaint 
dismissed, you need to file a Motion with these reasons 
 
 
before you file your Answer. 735 ILCS 5/2-301; 735 
 
 
ILCS 5/2-615. You should talk to a lawyer about this. 
 
The blank Motion form can be found at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 

 

 

Does everyone who receives a Summons and 
 
 
Complaint have to file an Answer to the Complaint? 
No, but if you want to try to get the property back, you 
must file an Answer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to file an Answer to 
 
 
Complaint for Forfeiture (Not Involving Drugs or 
 
Money Laundering)? 
o  Appearance (Civil Asset Forfeiture): Use this form 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to tell the court and other parties that you are 
participating in the court case. You should file it at 
 
the same time you file your Answer to Complaint for 
Forfeiture (Not Involving Drugs or Money 
Laundering). The email address (if you have one) 
and mailing address you put on the Appearance or 
Answer to Complaint for Forfeiture (Not Involving 
Drugs or Money Laundering) is where important 
legal documents will be sent to you. You should use 
an email account that you do not share with anyone 
else and that you check every day. If you do not 
check your email every day, you may miss important 
 
information, notice of court dates, or documents from 
other parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Answer to Complaint for Forfeiture (Not 
 

 
Involving Drugs or Money Laundering): Use this 
form to explain what you want the judge to do. 
Include any reasons why the judge should grant 
your request. 

o  Additional Proof of Delivery (Civil Asset 

 

Forfeiture): Only use this form if you need to send 
the Appearance (Civil Asset Forfeiture) and Answer 
to Complaint for Forfeiture (Not Involving Drugs or 
 
Money Laundering) to additional parties. 

 

 

 

 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/ 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Are there any costs to file an Answer? 
 
No. However, in order to file an Answer, you must also 
file an Appearance. There is a fee to file an Appearance. 
o 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee for the 
Appearance, you can ask the court to file for free or 
at a reduced cost. Fill out the Application for Waiver 
of Court Fees to ask the court for a fee waiver. 
o  You can find the Appearance and Application for 
 

Waiver of Court Fees forms at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
What happens if I do not file an Answer? 
 
The judge may rule in favor of the State automatically.

o 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your form. 
  
•  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 
 
 

 

 

 

 

flash drive. 
  

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 

 

 

 

that you can use to e-file your form. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 2: Send your Appearance and Answer to all 
other parties. 
 
o  You must send your Appearance and Answer to the 
 
 
other parties in the case. This includes the State's 
 
 
Attorney, any lien holder, and any other person who 
 
 
has a claim to the property. If a party has a lawyer, 
 
send the Appearance and Answer to the lawyer. 
 
If you and the person you're sending the 
 
Appearance and Answer to have an email address, 
 
 
you must send them by email or by notification 
 
through the e-filing system. If you or the person 
you’re sending the Appearance and Answer to does 
 
not have an email address, you may give them to 
the other parties by personal hand delivery, mail, or 
 
 
third-party commercial carrier (for example, FedEx 
or UPS). 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You must complete the Proof of Delivery at the end 
 
 
of the Appearance and Answer with information to 
 
show how you sent the forms to each party. The 
form has room for 3 parties. If you are sending the 
 
Answer to more than 3 parties, fill out and add 1 or 
 
more Additional Proof of Delivery forms. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 3: Get ready for your court date. 
 

Gather and make copies of pictures and documents you 
want the judge to see. You will need the original for the 
 
judge and one copy for you and each of the parties in 
 
the case. 
 
o 
 
 

If you want the judge to hear from other people, 
 
those people will have to come to court and testify 
 
(in most cases, you cannot bring in written 
statements of witnesses). Tell these people about 
 
the court date and find out if they can make it. Then 
 
write down what questions you want to ask them in 
 
front of the judge. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Prepare a set of questions to ask your witnesses 
 
 

and the other parties' witnesses. 
  

 
 

o  Decide and write down: 
 
 
•  What you want to ask the judge to do for you; 
 
 

 

AND 
  

•  What you will say to the judge if asked why you 
 

want your property back. 
 
 

 

           

 

 

What if I think I may have affirmative defenses or 
 
 
counterclaims? 
 
An affirmative defense is a legal reason why your 
 
property should not be forfeited. If you have affirmative 
defenses, you have to include them in your Answer. 
Examples of affirmative defenses include: 
 
o  That the State waited longer than the law allows to 
 
 
o  That the claim was already decided in an earlier 
 
 

file the Complaint; OR 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

court order 735 ILCS 5/2-613. 
 
There may be other affirmative defenses. 
 
Counterclaims are legal claims that you have against the 
State regarding the issues in this case. The counterclaim 
must be filed at the same time as your Answer. 
 
NOTE: You should talk to a lawyer about whether you 
 
have any affirmative defenses or counterclaims. 
  
 
What do I do after I fill out the Answer? 
 
 
Step 1: File your Appearance and Answer with the 
Circuit Clerk in the county where the court case is 
filed. 
 
o  You must file the Appearance and Answer to 
 
 

Complaint for Forfeiture (Not Involving Drugs or 
 
Money Laundering) with the trial court by the filing 
deadline that applies to your case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
 
available. 
  

 

 

 

• 
 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your Appearance 
 
 
and Answer, and the Certification, with the 
 
 
clerk’s office in person or by mail. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

provider: 
 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 

 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
user guides here:

elf-Represented_Litigants/E-
filing_Information.asp.

Step 7: The judge makes a decision after the parties 
 
present their cases. 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 
 
 

 

  
called a court order. 
 
If the judge has enough information, they will fill out 
an order. 
•  Get a copy of the order that has the court stamp 
 
 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 
on it. 

• 
 

 
 
If the other party was not in court to get a copy, 
you must send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the 
 
date you get the order. Fill out and file a Proof of 
 
Delivery court form with the Circuit Clerk to show 
  
that you sent the copy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

o 
 

 
If the judge needs more information to make a 
 
decision, the judge may set up another court date. 
 
Make sure you understand what information is 
  
needed and get it before the new court date. 
 
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge 
may let you know the decision later by mailing a 
 
court order. The judge might also decide at another 
 
court date. 

   

 

 

 

 

questioning witnesses. 
  
o 
 
 
You will get to see any 
 
documents and photos the other 
 
parties bring to court. If you do not 
 
think the judge should consider them 
 
in making a decision about your case, 
 
tell the judge why. 

 

 

           

 

 

 

   

Make sure you know how you are 
to attend your court date. 
Your court date could be in person, by 
   
phone or by video. If it is by phone or video 
 
it is called a “Remote Appearance.” Call 
 
the Circuit Clerk or visit their website for 
more information. To find the phone 
 
number for your Circuit Clerk, visit 
illinoiscourts.gov/court/CircuitCourt/Circuit 
CourtJudges/CCC_County.asp.

 

 

 

 

   

call-in or login 
information for your court 
date and make sure your 
 
 
technology is working. 
•  Follow the instructions 
 
 
 
on the court notice you 
 
received. Call the Circuit 
 
Clerk or Circuit Court or 
 
visit their websites for 
 
specific technology 
 
instructions. 

 

 

 

Step 4: Go to your court date. 
 
o 
 
 

 
If your court date is by phone or video: 
•  Make sure you have the 
 
 

 

Step 6: The other parties present their case. 
 
 
o  The other parties will also get to present their case 
 
by testifying, giving the judge evidence, and 

 

 

 

 

o  Follow these 
 

 
recommendations to appear by phone or video: 
courts.illinois.gov/CivilJustice/Training_Education/Re 
mote_Hearing_FAQ_for_SRLs.pdf. 
 
o  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 
•  Photo I.D.; 
 
 
•  Copies of all the documents you filed with the 
 
 

 

 
Circuit Clerk; 

 

•  Your driver’s license, state and city (if required 
 
by your city) registration and proof of insurance 
 
(only if a vehicle is involved); AND 

 

 

•  Other papers or proof related to your Answer, 
 

 

 

 
including proof of ownership of the property. 

 

o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. Go 
 
 
 
to the courtroom number listed on your court form. If 
 
your forms do not have a courtroom number, look for 
 
a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the Circuit 
 
Clerk. 

 

 

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

 
name and case number to be called. 

o  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 
 

 

 
introduce yourself. 

 

 
 
Step 5: Tell the judge your side of the case and 
 
answer questions. 
o  Show evidence including documents and photos. 
 
 

 

   

•  Give a copy to the judge and a copy to the other 
 
party. Be prepared to explain why the document 
 
 
or photo is important. 
•  You may be asked questions about what you 
 
 

 
say and the documents that you bring. 

 

o  Question witnesses. 
 
 
 

•  Tell the judge the name of your witnesses. 
 
  
•  Ask the witnesses questions you prepared in 
 

 

  
advance. 

•  The judge and the other party can ask questions 
 
 

 

 
of your witnesses when you are done. 
o  The judge decides whether the documents, photos, 
 
 
or witness testimony can be considered in making a 
   
decision about your case.
