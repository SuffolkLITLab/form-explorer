HOW TO FILE AN APPEARANCE 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
What is an Appearance? 
o  An Appearance is a form you file with the Circuit 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You might have received other court papers, like a 
 
 
Summons, that give you a deadline for filing your 
 
Appearance. 

 

 

 

 

o  You might give up your right to participate in the 
 
court case if you do not file your Appearance on 
 
time. 

 

 

 

 
 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
 
and-forms/approved-forms. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 
 
What costs will I need to pay to file an Appearance? 
o  There is a fee for filing an Appearance with the 
 

 
Circuit Clerk. The fee will be higher if you ask for a 
  
jury. 
 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees. This is a 
separate set of forms you can find at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
What do I do after I fill out the Appearance form? 
 
Step 1: File the Appearance with the Circuit Clerk in 
  
the county where your court case is filed. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
  
exemption from e-filing. 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
  
available. 

 

 

 

• 
 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

   

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your Appearance 
 
 
 
and the Certification with the Circuit Clerk’s 
 
 
office in person or by mail. 

 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

 
 

 

 

 

  
provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 

 

 

   

 
Clerk to tell the court and the other parties that you 
 
are participating in the court case. 
 

o  The Appearance also tells the court whether you 
 
 
want your case decided by a judge or a judge and 
 
jury. You do not have a right to a jury trial in every 
 
case. 
It also gives the court and other parties your name 
and address so they may contact you about the 
  
case. 

o 
 

 
 
Who can use the Appearance form? 
o  You can only file an Appearance for yourself, not for 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
anyone else. 
 
In most cases, companies must have attorneys and 
 
 
should not use this Appearance form. 

 

o 
 

 
 
When do I need to use the Appearance form? 
 
The Appearance form is required in most civil court 
 
 
cases.  For example, you must file an Appearance when: 
o  Someone sues you and you want to participate in 
 

 

 

 

 

the court case. If you do not file an Appearance and 
 
go to court as needed, the court case might go 
 
ahead without you and the court might rule against 
 
you. 

 

 

 

 

o  You had a lawyer but your lawyer stops representing 
 
  
you, and you are now going to represent yourself. 
 
 
You do NOT need to file an Appearance when you start 
 
a new court case by yourself without a lawyer. 
 
 
Why does the Appearance form ask for my email 
 
address? 
 
The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
 
you put on the form is where important legal documents 
 
will be sent to you. You should use an email account that 
 
you do not share with anyone else and that you check 
every day. If you do not check your email every day, you 
 
may miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
documents from other parties. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Is there a deadline for filing an Appearance? 
o  The deadline for filing an Appearance is different 
 
 

 

 

 
depending on the type of case.

o 
 

 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
  
terminal to e-file your forms. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 

 

 

  
a flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

  
that you can use to e-file your form. 

 

 

 
 
Step 2: Send a copy of your Appearance to the other 
 
parties in the case. 
o  You must send your Appearance to the other parties 
 
 
 
 
in the case. If a party has a lawyer, send the forms 
 
to the lawyer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you and the person you're sending the Appearance to 
 
have an email address, you must send it by email or by 
notification through the e-filing system. If you or the 
person you’re sending the Appearance to does not have 
 
 
an email address, you may give it to the other parties by 
 
 
personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party commercial 
  
carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
