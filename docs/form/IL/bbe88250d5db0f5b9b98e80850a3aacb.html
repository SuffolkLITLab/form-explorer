court. It should be a detailed description of what the 
judge, the parties, the witnesses, and the lawyers 
 
said or did in court during hearings or a trial. 
 
o  Agreed Statement of Facts: Like the Bystander’s 
 
 
Report, an Agreed Statement of Facts describes 
 
everything that was said or done in court during 
 
hearings or a trial. Unlike the Bystander’s Report, the 
 
parties must agree on everything that is in the Agreed 
Statement of Facts, and both parties must sign it. 
  
o  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
 
address you put on the (Bystander’s Report or 
 
Agreed Statement of Facts) is where important legal 
 
 
documents will be sent to you. You should use an 
email account that you do not share with anyone else 
and that you check every day. If you do not check 
 
 
your email every day, you may miss important 
 
information and documents from other parties. 
 

 
   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms. 
  
 
What costs will I need to pay when I file the 
 
 
Bystander’s Report or Agreed Statement of Facts 
 
forms? 
 
o  You do not need to pay to file either the Bystander’s 
 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Report or the Agreed Statement of Facts. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When do I need to use the Agreed Statement of 
 
Facts? 
 
o  The Agreed Statement of Facts should be used when 
 
 
you and the other parties agree on what was said and 
 
done in court. You will need to get the other parties to 
 
agree to and sign the Agreed Statement of Facts. 
      

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
When do I need to use the Bystander’s Report? 
 
 
o  You need to use a Bystander’s Report when you and 
 
the other parties cannot agree on what was said and 
 
done in court. 
  

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
How do I fill out the Bystander’s Report or Agreed 
 
Statement of Facts? 
 
 
o  The Bystander’s Report or Agreed Statement of 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Facts must describe in detail what everyone said or 
 
did in court during the hearings or trial. This includes 
 
what the judge, the parties, the witnesses, and the 
 
lawyers said or did in court. 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You should write the Bystander’s Report or Agreed 
 
Statement of Facts like a story or a script that says 
 
which person was speaking and what they said or 
 
did. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What is a Bystander’s Report or Agreed Statement 
 
 
of Facts? 
 
o  A Bystander’s Report and Agreed Statement of Facts 
 
 
 
describe everything that happened during court 
 
 
hearings or a trial. They include what the judge, the 
 
 
parties, the witnesses, and the lawyers said or 
 
 
 
testified to in court. They may also include a 
 
description of what happened in court in addition to 
what was said. 
  
 

o  You must use a Bystander’s Report or Agreed 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statement of Facts when there was no audio or video 
recording made of what happened in court, and when 
 
no court reporter was in court to take down what was 
 
said or done there. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  You can make a Bystander’s Report or Agreed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Statement of Facts part of the Record on Appeal so 
 
 
the appellate court will have a record of what was 
 
 
said or done in the trial court.  The Bystander's 
 
 
Report must be written by you but can be based on 
 
your own memory or the memory of others in court. 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 
What is the difference between a Bystander’s Report 
 
and Agreed Statement of Facts? 
 
 
o  A Bystander's Report requires the trial court judge's 
 
 
 
approval or certification. An Agreed Statement of 
 
 
 
Facts requires all parties to agree on what happened 
 
 
in court. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Who can use the forms for preparing the 
 
 
Bystander’s Report or an Agreed Statement of 
 
 
 
Facts? 
 
o  The appellant (person who filed the appeal) must 
 
 
make sure the Record on Appeal is complete. A 
complete Record on Appeal must include a record of 
 
what was said or done in court during hearings or a 
 
trial. 
 
 

o  If no audio or video recording was made, and there 
 
was no court reporter present to take down what 
 
happened in court, a Bystander’s Report or an 
Agreed Statement of Facts must be used to make the 
 
 
Record on Appeal complete. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What forms do I need to fill out to file a Bystander’s 
Report or an Agreed Statement of Facts? 
 
o  Bystander’s Report: This form tells the trial court 
 
 

 
judge and the other parties what was said or done in

o  You can ask others who were in the courtroom what 
 
 
they saw or heard to help you remember what 
 
 
happened in court. 
   
 
 

o  It is very important for you to make the Bystander’s 
 

 
Report or Agreed Statement of Facts as accurate and 
 
 
detailed as you can. 
 
 
 
 

o  You must also list all of the dates and times of the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

hearings or trial where testimony was given, evidence 
was introduced, or other things happened that will 
 
 
help the appellate court understand the facts relevant 
 
to your appeal. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  It is usually best for you to tell a story by writing down 
 
what each person said or did in the order that it 
   
 
happened. You should write your description so that 
 
a person who was not there can understand what 
 
happened. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Case Name 
 
o  Fill in this section the same way you filled it out on the 
 
 
 
 

Notice of Appeal (Civil). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Section 1 
 
o  In this section, you must list all of the dates and times 
 
 
 
 
of all the hearings and the trial (if it applies) in your 
 
 
 
 
case. 
  

 
   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

o  You must also list the names of the judges at each 
 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing or trial. 
 

 
 

 
Section 2 
 
o  The Bystander’s Report or Agreed Statement of 
 
 
 
Facts tells the appellate court everything the trial 
 
 
court judge, parties, lawyers, and witnesses said and 
 
 
did in court. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Signatures 
  
o  The person who made the Bystander’s Report must 
 
 

sign it. There is also a place for the trial court judge to 
 
sign it to show that it is approved. 
 

 
o  If you are using an Agreed Statement of Facts, then 
 
 
all of the parties or their attorneys must sign it. The 
 
trial court judge does not need to sign an Agreed 
 
 
Statement of Facts. 
  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
When do I have to file the Bystander’s Report or 
Agreed Statement of Facts? 
 
o  A Bystander's Report or Agreed Statement of Facts 
 
 
 
must be filed with the trial court clerk within 49 days 
 
 
after the date you filed the Notice of Appeal (Civil). 
  
o  The 49-day period to file the Bystander's Report or 
 
 
 

Agreed Statement of Facts starts on the day after you 
 
filed the Notice of Appeal (Civil). You must count 
 
 
weekends and holidays. However, if the 49th day is 
 
 
 
on a weekend or court holiday, you may file the 
 
 
Bystander's Report or Agreed Statement of Facts on 
 
 
the next business day. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  If you need more time, you will need to file a Motion 
 
for Extension of Time with the appellate court. You 
can use the Motion form found here: 
 
 
https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/forms/approved-
forms/approved-statewide-forms-appellate-
  
forms/motion. 

 

 

 

 

How do I file the Bystander’s Report or Agreed 
 
 
Statement of Facts? 
o  If you are using a Bystander's Report, there are 4 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
things that must happen before you can file it with the 
 
trial court clerk: 
•  First, you must serve the Bystander's Report on all 
 
 
 
of the other parties within 28 days after you filed the 
 
   
Notice of Appeal (Civil). If any party has a lawyer, 
 
you must send your Bystander's Report to the 
 
 
lawyer. The 28-day period starts on the day after 
 
you filed the Notice of Appeal (Civil). 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  You must count weekends and holidays. However, 
 
 
 
if the 28th day is on a weekend or court holiday, 
 
you may serve the Bystander’s Report on the next 
 
business day. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
   
 

•  If you and the person you're sending the 
 
 
 

Bystander’s Report to have an email address, you 
 
must send it by email or by notification through the 
 
e-filing system. If you or the person you’re sending 
 
 
the Bystander’s Report to does not have an email 
 
 
address, you may give it to the other parties by 
 
 
personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
  
 
 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 
•  Second, on the same date you serve your 
 
 
 

Bystander's Report, you must schedule a hearing 
 
 
in front of the trial court to approve the Bystander's 
Report. The hearing needs to occur between 14 
 
and 21 days after you serve your Bystander's 
 
Report. To schedule the hearing, fill out a circuit 
 
court Motion and Notice of Court Date for Motion 
 
 
and file it with the trial court. This is a separate set 
 
of forms that you can find at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms. Use the Motion to ask the court to approve 
your Bystander's Report. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

•  Third, within 14 days after you serve the 
 
 
 
 

 
Bystander's Report, any other party may serve you 
with suggested changes to your Bystander’s 
 
Report, or with their own Bystander's Report. 
  
•  Fourth, at the hearing, the trial court judge will 
 
 
 
decide whether to approve and certify the 
Bystander’s Report so that you can file it with the 
 
trial court clerk to be included in the Record on 
 
Appeal. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  After the trial court has heard and decided the 
 
 
 
 

Motion, you must file the Bystander's Report and the 
 
order approving it with the trial court clerk within 49 
days after you filed your Notice of Appeal (Civil). 
  
 
o  You must file the (Form Name) with the trial court by 
 
 
 
 

 
the filing deadline that applies to your case.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
