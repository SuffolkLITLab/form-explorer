G  2. If such mental illness is left untreated, is reasonably expected to result in an increase 

    
 in the symptoms caused by the illness to the point that the person would meet the criteria 
  
 for commitment under Section 1-119 of the Code, and whose mental illness has, on more 
 
 than one occasion in the past, caused that person to refuse needed and appropriate  
        
 mental health services in the community.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
