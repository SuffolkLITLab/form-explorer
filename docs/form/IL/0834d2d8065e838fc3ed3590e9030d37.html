On  behalf of the  Conference of Chief Circuit Judges,  I hereby  submit the approved  e-Citation Form

Guidelines 

Implementation of Electronic Citation Program 

The  implementation of an  Electronic  Citation Program  (e-Citation)  is  authorized  in  any  county, 
except  Cook  County,  within  the  State  of Illinois  by  the  Illinois  State  Police.  The  ISP  may 
implement  the  approved  electronic  citation  program  using  an  8  ½"  x  11"  citation  form,  which 
must be accepted for filing by circuit clerks in the remaining  101  Illinois counties. 

The implementation of an e-Citation program by local law enforcement may be authorized in any 
county upon the  submission of a written request from  each law enforcement agency to the Chief 
Judge of the Circuit (Chief Judge) and the Clerk of the Circuit Court (Circuit Clerk). 

The  following  criteria  shall  be  met  by  each  vendor  and  e-Citation  program  pnor  to 
implementation being authorized by the Circuit Clerk: 

D  The  Circuit  Clerk  has  been approved  and  is  actively  participating  in the  Automated 
Disposition  Reporting  Program. 
In  the  event  that  the  Automated  Disposition 
Reporting  Program  is  suspended  after  an  e-Citation  program  is  implemented, 
appropriate procedures must be implemented to ensure proper reporting of disposition 
information to the recipient agencies during the suspension. 

D  The  citation  form  and  format  shall  meet  the  minimum  standards  for  electronic 
citations approved  by  the  Conference of Chief Circuit Judges  (Conference) and filed 
with the Clerk of the Supreme Court pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 552. 

D  Identify the vendor performing the electronic citation functions and include a copy of 
each  page  of the  citation  form  indicating  the  type  of paper  (bond  or  thermal)  to  be 
used. 

D  The  application  for  court  supervision  and/or  traffic  safety  school  for  counties which 
have  been authorized to  accept supervision by  mail pursuant to  Supreme  Court Rule 
529(c)  must  meet  the  requirements  of Supreme  Court  Rules  and  the  Traffic  Safety 
Program Standards adopted by the Conference. 

D  Each citation shall  be  filed  with the  Circuit Clerk and  contain the  signature(s)  of the 
issuing  officer  and,  when  required,  the  violator.  Electronic  filing  and  electronic 
signatures may be applied only in counties authorized by the Supreme Court. 

D  Data and  document  exchange  fonnats  may  be  implemented  at  the  discretion  of the 

Circuit Clerk.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
