      <pre>HOW TO DO A CITATION TO DISCOVER ASSETS TO 
 
 
DEBTOR'S EMPLOYER ("WAGE DEDUCTION/GARNISHMENT") 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Where can I find the form I need? 
You can find the form at: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 

 
 

 

Does it cost to file a Citation to Discover Assets to 
 
Debtor's Employer? 
 
o	  Yes, there is a fee for filing a Citation to Discover 
Assets to Debtor's Employer with the Circuit Clerk. 

 

 

o	  There will also be a fee for the sheriff or private 

 

 

 

process server. 
If you cannot afford to pay the cost, you can ask the 
court to file for free. Fill out the Application for 
 
Waiver of Court Fees to ask the court for a fee 
waiver. This is a separate set of forms you can find 
at: http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 

 

 

o	 

 

 

Fill out the Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
 
Employer following the instructions on the form. 
 
You will need the address where the employer can be 
 
 
served and the address where you will send the debtor 
 
notice. See Steps 2 and 3. 
 

 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the Citation to Discover
 
 
 
Assets to Debtor's Employer?
 
 
Step 1: File your forms with the Circuit Clerk in the
 
 
county where the court case is filed.
 
 
o	  Ask the Circuit Clerk for a court date, time, and 
 
courtroom number for your Citation to Discover 
 
Assets to Debtor's Employer. The employer is 
required to respond by this time. 

 

 

 

 

o	  Write the courthouse address, court date, time, and 
courtroom number on the Citation to Discover 
Assets to Debtor's Employer. 
 

o	  Ask the Circuit Clerk how much it will cost to file 

 

 

your form, and what types of payment (cash, check, 
 
credit, online) they take. 

 

 

o	  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
unless you qualify for an exemption from e-filing. 
•	  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer, (2) you 
have a disability that keeps you from e-filing, or 
 
 
(3) you have trouble reading or speaking 
English. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	  Fill out a Certification for Exemption from E-

 

Filing found here: 
www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default. 
asp. 

•	  File the original and 1 copy of your Citation 
 
form, and the Certification, with the Circuit 
Clerk’s office in person or by mail. 

o	  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

provider. 

   

What is a Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
 
Employer? 
A Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Employer is 
 
commonly known as a wage deduction or garnishment. 
 
It is a court document that tells the employer to answer 
 
questions about the debtor’s wages. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who can file a Citation to Discover Assets to 
 
Debtor's Employer? 
 
Anyone who has won a judgment for money against 
 
another person can file a Citation to Discover Assets to 
 
 
 
Debtor's Employer to try to collect the money. 
o	  The person who won the judgment is called the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  The person who owes the money is called the 

 

o	  The debtor's employer is called the “respondent.” 
 

   

“creditor.” 

“debtor.” 
 

 

Using the Citation, the creditor can try to get those 
wages to pay the judgment, if they are not protected by 
 
law. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What if my judgment is over 7 years old? 
 
o	 

If your judgment is over 7 years old, you will need to 
renew (“revive”) your judgment before you can do a 
Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor Employer. To 
start the process, file and serve a Petition for 
Revival. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  You can renew (“revive”) a judgment only up to the 

o	 

20th year from the date of your judgment. 
If your judgment is over 27 years old, you cannot 
 
enforce your judgment. 

 

 

   
 

   

 
 
Who do I serve the Citation on? 
o	  You must use the employer’s correct legal name. 

 

 

 

 

Using a name like “Joe’s Auto Repair” or 
“McDonalds” is not legally sufficient and may lead to 
 
problems if the employer does not file an answer. 
 
If the employer is a person, you serve that person. 
If the employer is a company, you serve an officer or 
registered agent. 
•	  You can use the Secretary of State’s website to 

 
 

 

 

 

 

o	 
o	 

 

 
find the officer or registered agent: 
http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/ 

o	  NOTE: you cannot use this form if the employer is 

 

 

 

 

 

not doing business in Illinois. 

 

 
What form do I need for the Citation to Discover 
 
Assets to Debtor's Employer? 
o	  Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 

 

 

Employer: This form tells the employer to answer 
questions about the debtor’s wages. 

 

 

 

 

 

   

o	  Letter to the Sheriff (optional): is a letter that tells 
the sheriff the addresses of the employers to serve.

service providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee.

ces/Self-Represented_Litigants/self­
 
represented.asp 

o	 
 

 

If you do not have access to a computer, or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your form. 
•	  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 
 
 

 

 

 

  
flash drive. 

•	  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

 
that you can use to e-file your form. 

 

  
Step 2: Serve the employer a copy of your form. 
o	  The Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
 
 

   

 

Employer must be served on the employer. The 
 
judge will have no power to order the employer to do 
anything if the Citation to Discover Assets to 
Debtor's Employer is not served. 

   

 

 

o	  You can use the sheriff, a private process server, or 
 
 
 

 

Certified Mail to serve the employer with the 
 
Citation. You cannot give the Citation to the 
  
 
employer yourself. 

 

 

 

 

 

o	 
 

o	  The sheriff or the private process server will require 
 
 
  
the original Citation and 2 file-stamped copies. 
 
If by sheriff 
•	  Contact the sheriff's office in the county where 
 
the employer is located for more information 
about how to serve the Citation on the 
 
employer. 
  
If the sheriff wants it in person: 

 

•	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 
 

 
Bring the file-stamped copies of your 
  
Citation to the sheriff's office. 
 
Pay the sheriff’s fees for the debtor OR give 
 
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver 
 
of Court Fees (if you have one) to not be 
  
charged a fee. 
 

 
If the sheriff wants you to mail it to the sheriff's 
  
office: 
 Mail copies of your Citation to the sheriff’s 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 



 

 

 
office. 
 
Include the Letter to the Sheriff found at: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approve 
 
d/ 
 
Pay the sheriff’s fees for each party OR mail 
 
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver 
 
of Court Fees (if you have one) to not be 
 
charged a fee. 

 

 

 

•	 
 

o	 
 

 
If by private process server 
•	  You may also have the forms served by a 
 

 
 
private process server. A private process server 
is anyone 18 or older and not a party to the 
 
lawsuit. Private process servers do not accept 
  
fee waivers. 
 

 

 

 

SC-I 3002.1 
 
 

o	 
 

If by Certified Mail 
 
•	  The Citation may also be served by Certified 
 

 

Mail, restricted delivery, return receipt 
 
requested. 
 

 

 

o	  NOTE: If you e-filed your Citation and you want to 
 
 
use the sheriff to serve the Citation, contact your 
 
 
sheriff's office to ask if the sheriff will file the 
Return/Affidavit of Service or if you will have to e-file 
 
it. If you use a private process server, you or the 
process server will have to file the Return/Affidavit 
 
of Service when you receive it back. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
Step 3:  Mail a copy of the Citation to Discover 
 
  
Assets to Debtor's Employer to the debtor. 
o	  The person serving the Citation must send a copy of 
 
 
 
 
the Citation to the debtor by regular first-class mail 
 
within three days after the service on the employer. 
 
If you use certified mail, you may mail it to the 
 
 
debtor at the same time. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

o	 
 

Step 4: If you served by sheriff or private process 
 
server and you have not received the Answer from 
 
the employer, contact the sheriff or private process 
server to confirm they served your forms on the 
 
employer. 
  
o	  Before court, you should check on whether the 
 
 
employer was served. This is called the 
Return/Affidavit of Service. You may be able to 
check this online. Find your local Circuit Clerk’s 
 
 
website at:  http://www.ilcourtclerks.org/illinois-court­
 
clerks/. 
If the employer was served, make sure the 
 
 
Return/Affidavit of Service is filed with the Circuit 
Clerk. The judge has no power to do anything if the 
 
Citation is not served. 
 
 
If you sent the Citation by certified mail, you must 
 
have the green receipt card to prove that the 
employer was served. Attach the green card to the 
 
original Citation and bring it to court. The clerk will 
  
put it into the court file. 
 
If the Return/Affidavit of Service says “no service,” 
this means that the sheriff's deputy tried to find the 
 
employer, but could not serve them. If this happens, 
you must start over. The fee is less on the second 
  
attempt. 
 

o	  NOTE: You should review the Return/Affidavit of 
 
 
 
 
Service. If it says the employer moved, or is not 
located at the address you wrote down, you should 
find a new address for the employer before starting 
  
again. 

o	 
 

o	 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 5: Go to your court date. 
o	  Your court date, time and room number are listed on 
 

 

your Citation. 
 

 

o	  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 

•	  A copy of the Citation to Discover Assets to 
 
 
Debtor's Employer; 
•	  A copy of the written judgment (if you have 
 
 

 

 

 

 
one);

(03/18) 
 

 

 

 

  
Step 7: Certify balance owed to employer. 
o	 
 

If the court enters a Wage Deduction Order, you 
 
must mail the employer a Certification of Judgment 
 
 
Balance every 3 months. This is simply a letter 
 
showing the employer the balance due after 
calculating additional judgment interest and 
 
deducting payments. 

 

 

 

   

•	  Any receipts you have of your court costs, 
 
 
including any costs for the sheriff or private 
 
process server; 
 

 

 

 

•	  The Return/Affidavit of Service showing that the 
 

 

 

Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
Employer was served on the employer; AND 
 

 

 

•	  Any Answer you have received from the 
 

 

employer. 
 

o	  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
 
 
o	  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
 
 

 

form. 
 

o	  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

   

name and case number to be called. 
 
If the employer was served, but does not show 
 
up for the hearing or file an Answer: 
 
•	  The judge may enter a conditional judgment 
 
 
 
against the employer for failure to answer. A 
 
 
conditional judgment requires the employer to 
 
file an answer on or before the next court date. 
 
The creditor must issue a Summons after 
Conditional Judgment and serve it on the 
employer by sheriff or private process server. If 
 
 
the employer does not answer, the court may 
 
enter a final judgment against the bank for the 
 
balance due. 
  

 

 

 

 

•	  The judge may issue a Rule to Show Cause 
 
 
requiring the employer to appear and explain 
why they did not answer. If the employer fails to 
 
file an answer or appear for the Rule, the court 
 
may find them in contempt and may order their 
 
arrest. 
 

 

 

 

 

o	 
 

o	 
 

If the employer files an Answer: 
•	 
 

 

 

 

 

If the employer's Answer says that they do not 
 
 
employ the debtor then the Citation to Discover 
 
Assets to Debtor's Employer will be dismissed. 
  
If the employer’s Answer says that it employs 
 
the debtor, you can ask the judge for a Wage 
 
Deduction Order. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  There are limits on wage garnishments. The debtor 
 
 
must be allowed to take home a certain amount 
 
each pay period. If the debtor’s wages are above 
that amount, the garnishment cannot be more than 
15% of the debtor’s wages. It is also possible that 
 
there are other garnishments that must be paid 
before yours. If the employer answers the Citation in 
 
 
writing, you will see how much can be garnished at 
 
that time. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 6: After court, send a copy of any order entered to 
the employer's representative. 
  
•	 
 

If there are funds to be turned over, make sure you 
have your current address on the order. 
  

 

 

 

 

 
 

•	  Send a copy of the court’s order with the clerk’s 
 
 
filing stamp on it to the employer at the address 
 
shown on their answer. If the court directs the 
 
 
money to be turned over to you, you should send 
the employer a letter telling them where to send the 
money and include the order.
