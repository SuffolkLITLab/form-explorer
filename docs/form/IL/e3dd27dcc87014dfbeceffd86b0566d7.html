HOW TO ASK THE APPELLATE COURT TO 
 
PARTICIPATE IN AN APPEAL FOR FREE OR AT A 
 
REDUCED COST 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
All the Supreme Court Rules mentioned in these
 
instructions can be found at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/rules/supreme-court-rules. 
 

 
Do I have to pay a fee to file an Application for 
 
Waiver of Court Fees (Appellate Court)? 
o  No, there is no cost for filing an Application for 
 
 
 
 
 
Waiver of Court Fees. 

 
 
Is there a deadline for filing an Application for 
 
Waiver of Court Fees? 
o  At the time you file your first document with the 
 
appellate court, you must file a completed 
Application for Waiver of Court Fees. 
 
It might take the appellate court a couple of weeks to 
review your application and decide whether you 
 
have to pay the appellate court fees, so do not wait 
 
until the last minute. 

   
 

 
 
 

o 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 
 

 
 
 

Who can ask the court to participate in an appeal for 
 
free or at a reduced cost? 
 
Anyone who must pay a fee as part of an appellate court 
 
case. You can ask for yourself, your minor child, or an 
 
incompetent adult, but not for anyone else. NOTE: this 
 
 
form cannot be used to waive fees charged by the trial 
 
court or by court reporters for preparation of a record on 
 
 
appeal. 
 
 
How will I know if there is a fee? 
 
 
The Appellate Clerk can tell you if there is a fee for filing 
 
 
a document with the court.  Supreme Court Rule 313 
 
  
requires the person who files an appeal to pay a $50 fee. 
  
 
Rule 313 requires all other parties to pay a $30 fee. 
 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to ask the appellate
 
court to let me participate in an appeal for free or at
 
 
a reduced cost? 
 
 
o  Application for Waiver of Court Fees (Appellate 
 
 
Court) is used to tell the court whether you get any 
 
public benefits and your income and expense 
information so it can decide if you can participate in 
an appeal for free or at a reduced cost. 
 
 

 
o  Order for Waiver of Court Fees (Appellate Court)
 
 
is used by the court to say whether your application 
 
is granted or denied. Complete the top half of the 
Order and attach to the Application for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees. 
 
 
 

The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
 
you put on the form is where important legal documents 
 
 
will be sent to you. You should use an email account that 
 
you do not share with anyone else and that you check 
 
every day. If you do not check your email every day, you 
may miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
documents from other parties. 
 
 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
   
o  You can find forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
 
 

 
 
   

 
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and-forms/approved-forms. 

o  You can also ask the Appellate Clerk for a copy. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

AWA-I 1302.5 
 
 

o  You are responsible for knowing if there are other 
 
 
 

 

 

 
deadlines to file documents. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

   

 
 
How do I prove I cannot afford to pay court fees? 
The court may require you to prove the information in 
 
 
your Application. If you get public benefits, you may be 
 
 
asked to provide documents showing you receive public 
 
 
benefits, such as a benefits statement from the agency 
 
providing the benefit. 
 
 
 
Examples of public benefits are: 
o  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (Not Social 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Security) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) 
  
 
o  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) 
  
 
o  Food Stamps (SNAP) 
 
 
o  General Assistance (GA),Transitional Assistance, or 
 
 
  

State Children & Family Assistance 
  
 
 

If you don't get public benefits, you may be asked to 
 
provide documents showing your income, value of 
 
belongings (for example, real estate), and expenses. 
 
 
 
What happens if my Application is granted? 
 
Depending upon your circumstances, the appellate court 
 
may order that: 
 
o  You may participate for free; 
 
 
o  You must pay 25% of any fee charged; 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 50% of any fee charged; OR 
 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 75% of any fee charged. 
 
 
 
 
 
If my Application is granted, will I ever have to pay 
fees? 
 
o 
 
 

If the court grants your Application and later decides 
 
that the information you put in your Application was 
 
 
incorrect and you were ineligible, the court can make 
you pay back any fees that were waived.

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
 
need help e-filing, bring your form to the trial court 
clerk's office or appellate court clerk's office where 
 
you can use a public computer terminal to e-file your 
  
form. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
a flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

  
that you can use to e-file your form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Step 2: Wait for a decision. 
o  The appellate Court will review your Application for 
 
 
 
 
Waiver of Court Fees and decide whether you have 
 
 
to pay the Supreme Court fees. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The appellate Court may need more information 
 

 
   
from you. The Supreme Court Clerk will notify you if 
 
you need to give more information. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  After the court makes a decision, the court will 
 
 
 
 
 
complete the Order for Waiver of Court Fees 
 
(Appellate Court). The Order for Waiver of Court 
 
Fees will show if you have to pay any court fees. 
o  The Appellate Clerk will mail or email you a copy of 
 
 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the Order. 
 
 
If the court decides you have to pay all or some of 
 
the court fees, you have to pay by the deadline set 
   
 
Order for Waiver of Court Fees (Appellate Court). If 
 
 
you do not pay by the deadline, the court may 
 
 
dismiss your case or find against you. 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

                                   

o 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the court believes that your financial situation has 
 
 
changed and you are no longer eligible for a full or 
 
partial fee waiver, the court may ask you to provide 
 
documents showing you are still eligible. 
  
If the court decides you do not have to pay all or 
 
 
some of the court fees and you win your case and 
get money from the other side, the court may make 
 
 
you use all or part of this money to pay the court 
 
 
fees. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 
 

   
 
 

 
When does my fee waiver expire? 
 
 
It is good for one year. If you still need the fee waiver 
 
after it expires, you will need to file a new Application. 
 
However, this does not mean you have to pay back fees 
 
 
that were already waived. 
  
 
What do I do after I fill out the Application for Waiver 
 
of Court Fees and Order for Waiver of Court Fees 
 
 
form? 
 
Step 1: File your Application with the appellate 
court. 
 
o  You must file your forms with the appellate court 
 
 
 

where your appeal will be heard. Your appeal will be 
 
heard in the appellate court district where the trial 
 
court that ruled on your case is located. For help 
 
determining which appellate court your appeal 
 
should be filed in, click here: 
 
 
 
 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Appellate_Court 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
 
available. 
  

 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 
 

 
  
provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help
