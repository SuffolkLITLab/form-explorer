Formation of the Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board  

The Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board (Board) was created with the signing of Public Act 101-0652 
(the “SAFE-T Act”, or Act) in February 2021. The goal of the Board’s creation was “to oversee the 
collection and analysis of data regarding pretrial practices in circuit court systems” (20 ILCS 3930/7.7). 

The Administrative Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts (AOIC) convened the Board 
in July of 2021 and held the inaugural meeting of the group in August of 2021.  Since that time the Board 
has met monthly to complete the work defined in the Act. 

Through the creation of PA 101-0652 (the “SAFE-T Act”, or Act), the Pretrial Practices Data Oversight 
Board (Board) was provided with four distinct charges: 

Identify existing pretrial data collection processes in local jurisdictions. 

1. 
2.  Define, gather and maintain records of pretrial data from applicable criminal justice system 

agencies.  
3. 
Identify resources necessary to systematically collect and report data as defined in the Act. 
4.  Develop a plan to implement data collection processes sufficient to collect data as defined in the 

Act starting July 1, 2022. 

These charges are defined in greater detail as follows: 

1. 

Identify existing pretrial data collection processes in local jurisdictions. 

Prior to the formation of the Board, in the fall of 2020, the Illinois Supreme Court Commission on 
Pretrial Practices Implementation Task Force (Task Force) convened a working group (Data 
Subcommittee) to identify the pretrial data collection practices in place in local jurisdictions.  

The Data Subcommittee chose 121 of Illinois’ 102 counties, distributed throughout the State and 
including 4 large, 4 medium and 4 small, based upon the county’s population.  This sample was further 
stratified to counties with established pretrial services and those without, or with newly emerging 
pretrial services.  The committee was able to interview justice system representatives from 11 of the 12 
counties through Zoom. The interview consisted of identifying the computer software used in each 
county agency to track pretrial defendants and discussing whether any data analysis of pretrial practices 
had been previously conducted in each county. The interview also went over 48 key pretrial data 
elements to determine whether those data elements were captured in unique fields. Data elements 
recorded in unique fields rather than in general text fields are crucial to efficiently collect and analyze 
the data elements from the separate systems without having to do extensive recoding or data cleaning. 
In most counties, the Pretrial/Probation Department, Sheriff’s Office and Circuit Clerk’s Office 
participated in the interviews.  In some jurisdictions, other stakeholders such as Judges, Public 
Defenders, State’s Attorneys and IT professionals also participated. Finally, all 102-county 
pretrial/probation departments were contacted and asked basic operational questions related to 
pretrial services. 

1 The twelve counties were: Champaign, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, Lee, Livingston, McDonough (9th Circuit), 
Morgan, St. Clair, Tazewell, Winnebago, Williamson. 

 

retrial Practices Data Oversight Board Charges 

  P

The work of the Data Subcommittee produced the following key findings: 

•  Most counties have never systematically performed data analyses to examine their pretrial 
system or practices. The lack of systematic analyses occurs for many reasons, including: 
o  Stakeholders’ case management systems do not easily allow data entry or extraction. Often, 
if data are collected by Pretrial Departments, it is recorded in an Excel spreadsheet separate 
from their information system.  
If the data are in the case management systems, often there are not existing reports that 
can be generated to summarize pretrial data for management or strategic planning 
purposes. 

o 

o  Most counties do not have dedicated IT professionals to extract the data needed for such 
analyses, or to combine the data that may reside in separate information systems across 
different agencies to perform these analyses. 

o  Most do not feel they know what specific analyses should be performed or how to perform 

o 

those analyses, acknowledging they are not data analysts/researchers. 
If a case management system is capable of producing reports, there are extra costs 
associated with the creation of the reports. 

•  Of the 48 key pretrial data elements identified in the Pretrial Implementation Task Force’s Data 
Subcommittee, most (66%) are collected by county systems (Pretrial/Probation, Sheriff, Circuit 
Clerk) as dedicated, type-appropriate fields rather than free form text fields in existing 
information systems. However, at this point it is not possible to determine how completely and 
consistently these data elements are actually recorded in the existing information systems. 

•  The greater majority of the 48 data elements are collected in the information systems 
maintained by County Sheriff’s Offices and Circuit Clerk’s Offices. Pretrial/Probation 
Departments capture most of the key pretrial data elements, but only for those cases they 
directly serve, not the entirety of the pretrial population. In most of Illinois’ counties, a very 
small proportion of individuals who go through the pretrial process are served directly by 
Pretrial/Probation Departments. 

•  Electronic monitoring (EM) is managed differently in nearly every jurisdiction. Therefore, data 
elements related to electronic monitoring are not collected consistently or regularly by county 
justice agencies.  For example, some counties contract with a third-party vendor for the EM 
operations and those vendors collect and maintain the EM data separate from county systems. 
In other counties the Sheriff’s Office, State’s Attorney’s Office, Probation/Pretrial Department or 
some combination of these offices manage the EM program. 
If present, data elements needed to measure pretrial success rates, including failure to appear 
occurrences and new criminal offenses, are not in a format or specifically tied to other case 
indicators that would allow for easy calculation of these success rates.  
o  Defendant attendance at each individual court date is only collected as a unique data field in 

• 

half of the counties interviewed.  

o  Record checks for new criminal offenses only occur by court personnel checking the local 
Circuit Clerk’s system to determine if new charges were filed and by performing a check of 
the Illinois State Police’s Criminal History Record Information (i.e., LEADS) and the National 
Crime Information Center (NCIC) to determine if new arrests or charges occurred in other 
jurisdictions. Currently, this must be done manually for each individual defendant, as there 
is no automatically triggered mechanism for statewide or nationwide record checks for 
pretrial defendants. 

•  Booking and releasing defendants through municipal lockups complicates data collection, as 
these defendants are not recorded in the county systems until the defendant has a court 
appearance through the county court system. A survey of Sheriff’s Offices developed and 
distributed by the Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board suggests that in many of Illinois’ 
largest counties, a substantial number of individuals arrested are released directly from 
municipal lockups rather than county jails. 
Improving consistency and availability of key pretrial data elements will not be an easy process. 
It is likely to require extensive agreements, memorandums of understanding (MOU), 
Administrative Orders from Chief Circuit Judges, and significant funding to counties to support 
the necessary upgrades in their case management systems. 

• 

•  Many stakeholders worry about the cost of data extraction, processing and sharing that they 

fear will most likely be borne by the counties. 

•  The AOIC has spent several months identifying data elements that will be collected as part of a 

comprehensive data collection and online reporting program. The elements that will be 
collected from court case management systems include primarily those elements that are 
already reported as part of the automated disposition reporting system (ADR), quarterly or 
annual statistical reporting, and financial reporting. Since data entry and business practices vary 
widely from county to county, it is not yet known how many elements will be immediately 
collectable. However, AOIC will work with each court’s case management system (CMS) vendor 
to identify gaps and recommend field development where needed.  
 

2.  Define, gather and maintain records of pretrial data relating to the topics listed in 20 ILCS 

3930/7.7(c) from circuit clerks’ offices, sheriff’s departments, law enforcement agencies, jails, 
pretrial departments, probation departments, state’s attorneys’ offices, public defenders’ offices 
and other applicable criminal justice system agencies. 

In the winter of 2020/2021, prior to the passage of PA 101-0652 and 20 ILCS 3930/7.7(c), the AOIC 
formed a pretrial data working group, including national and state experts, with the goal of developing a 
comprehensive set of pretrial data elements that would need to be collected from county circuit clerks, 
pretrial and probation departments and county jails operated by sheriff’s offices. That work was 
completed early in 2021. Since that time the AOIC has continued to work with experts in the field to 
expand and refine the set of data elements and build those into the Judicial Branch’s middleware, which 
is software that will eventually integrate each individual circuit court case management system with the 
AOIC’s system.  The Board convened a working group to review the pretrial measures and compare it to 
the required pretrial data topics identified in 20 ILCS 3930/7.7(c) for comprehensiveness.  Based upon 
this review, a comprehensive list of data elements has been developed and is being integrated into the 
middleware of the Judicial Branch. As stated previously, the vast majority of the data elements will come 
from Circuit Clerks, Sheriff’s Offices (Jails) and Pretrial/Probation Departments in Illinois.  

While 20 ILCS 3930/7.7 directs that data collection begin July 1, 2022, collection of county-level data is 
not yet possible due to the many data infrastructure and funding limitations listed in the previous 
section. A significant amount of work and resources are still needed across each of the 102 counties to 
ensure that the data management systems used by each individual Circuit Clerk, Sheriff/Jail and 
Pretrial/Probation Department capture the needed data elements in a consistent/usable format, before 
data can be transmitted to, and analyzed by, AOIC.  

3. 

Identify resources necessary to systematically collect and report data related to the topics 
listed in 20 ILCS 3930/7.7(c). 

Though a specific cost estimate is not available, the Board has identified there will be substantial costs 
incurred by local county Circuit Clerks, Sheriffs/Jails and Pretrial/Probation Departments to integrate 
their case management software with the Judicial Branch’s data collection and reporting platform, 
Socrata. Further, this will require additional data elements to be added into the case management 
software of the local departments and for staff to be trained and then begin collecting the additional 
elements. The legislation did not identify a funding source for these costs incurred by counties. 

4.  Develop a plan to implement data collection processes sufficient to collect data on the topics 

listed in (c)- data collection to start July 1, 2022. 

The Pretrial Data Oversight Board recognizes how critical quality data collection is to further 
transparency, informed policy decision-making, and meaningful criminal justice system analysis. 
Therefore, considerable effort must be made to standardize data collection, transitioning from manual, 
including paper based, report preparation to direct transmission. Standardized and automated reporting 
will aid in minimizing errors and misinterpretation and reduce the burden of individual courts in 
responding to data requests. However, such statewide systemic change cannot take place overnight. In 
Illinois, there are currently 14 court case management systems, and a myriad of probation, pretrial and 
jail case management systems. While the Illinois Supreme Court, through the AOIC, does collect some 
data from all Illinois counties, none of the existing systems are integrated, and reports are submitted 
manually. Thorough, complete, and accurate data collection and reporting will require system-wide 
change, which the Illinois Supreme Court is prepared to lead.  

In that vein, the AOIC has developed a multi-step plan to facilitate data collection and reporting. The 
Judicial Branch has contracted with Tyler Technologies for the use of Socrata, its data and insights 
product. AOIC is working with Socrata to integrate with local court case management systems, 
expanding existing APIs (application programming interface) where possible, and building new 
integrations with probation and pretrial departments.  The AOIC has already begun inputting historical, 
aggregate data into the reporting platform, which provides some capacity for longitudinal analyses. The 
focus of the AOIC in the near term will be integrating with internal Judicial Branch stakeholders (Circuit 
Clerks and Probation/Pretrial Departments).  While that work is underway integrations will be sought 
with non-Judicial Branch stakeholders, such as Sheriff’s Departments/county jails. After these steps are 
completed and county-level data is integrated with the AOIC, it is the intention of the AOIC to aggregate 
the data on public dashboards. 

In the near term, an integration with circuit court case management systems is being built to capture 
data elements that must be collected by Circuit Clerks. This integration will leverage an existing API to 
minimize costs and streamline collection. It is expected it will take at least a year to begin reporting 
case-level data, but is dependent on funding for the project, and the ability of counties to shift business 
practices to collect some elements. 

The Office of Statewide Pretrial Services (OSPS) is presently building operations to provide pretrial 
services in 69 Illinois counties. The Office is currently seeking case management software, to include 
data collection and integration with the Judicial Branch’s middleware, through an RFP (request for 
proposal) process. It is estimated this software will be operational within one year of contract execution.  

The remaining counties in Illinois will be served by local Pretrial/Probation Departments. It is estimated 
these counties will be able to provide data by July 1, 2023, but this time frame is dependent on funding. 

Finally, it is least clear how long it will take for county jails to provide data to the Judicial Branch’s 
middleware. As a first step to understanding the data management systems used by jails in Illinois, the 
Pretrial Data Oversight Board conducted a survey of all county jails in Illinois. Among other findings, the 
survey found the information technology systems used by jails across the state vary widely, and not all 
of the systems capture case-level identifiers such as State Identification or court case numbers, which 
are important to the ability to link court cases across systems. See Exhibit A for the survey results.  

Moving Forward 

The Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board is committed to continuing to meet quarterly to support 
further advancements in the collection of pretrial data as articulated in 20 ILCS 3930/7.7(c). Updates 
regarding this process will be provided periodically on the Illinois Supreme Court’s Website 
(illinoiscourts.gov). 

     

Results of the Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board  
Survey of Illinois Sheriffs (2022) 

ntroduction and Methodology 

Pursuant to 20 ILCS 3930/7.7, which required the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts 
(AOIC) to establish a Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board (PPDOB) and identify existing 
pretrial data collection processes in local jurisdictions, a survey of county sheriff’s offices in 
Illinois was designed and administered by the PPDOB. The survey sought to obtain information 
from the county sheriff’s offices to assess their ability and capacity to provide data that AOIC is 
required to collect per Public Act (PA) 101-0652 (enacted February 22, 2021 and referred to as 
the Pretrial Fairness Act, or PFA). The survey also sought to better understand the role of county 
sheriff’s offices in processing of arrestees, how pretrial detainees are transported to court, and the 
use/capacity for jails to conduct video conferencing for court hearings.  In addition to 
establishing the Pretrial Practices Data Oversight Board, 20 ILCS 3930/7.7 also requires AOIC 
to collect and maintain pretrial data from county justice agencies, determine the resources needed 
to achieve these goals, and regularly produce and publish analyses of these data. 

The original request to complete the on-line survey (see below for a copy of the survey) was sent 
to all 102 of Illinois’ elected sheriffs on 1/27/2022 by the Executive Director of the Illinois 
Sheriff’s Association, an appointed member of the PPDOB. Two subsequent requests were sent 
to those Sheriff’s Offices that had not responded on 2/18/22 and 3/7/22. As a result of these 
efforts, the PPDOB received 79 completed surveys. Of the 23 Sheriff’s Offices that did not 
respond, 11 did not operate a jail. The Sheriff’s Offices that did respond to the survey represent 
roughly 95% of all pretrial jail bookings and average daily population of jails in Illinois during 
2021. 

Findings 

Of the counties that responded to the survey, most (96%) operated a jail. From other data sources 
in Illinois, it is known that 11 of Illinois’ 102 counties (11%) do not operate their own jail, thus 
the respondents to the survey were primarily those that operated jails. For most of the remaining 
analyses, only those counties operating jails are included. When all responses, including those 
that do not operate a jail, are included in the analyses that will be noted. 

Central Booking Facility 

Of the counties that operate jails and responded to the survey, 92% indicated that the jail serves 
as the central booking facility for the county. In other words, all adults subject to a custodial 
arrest (i.e., fingerprinted) are processed through the county jail facility.  

Jail Proximity to Courthouse(s) 

The survey also sought to determine the proximity of the jail(s) in each county to the courthouse, 
and how pretrial detainees are physically transported to court. For most (63%) counties, the jail 
is adjacent to the courthouse and detainees are walked to court from the jail. In one-third (33%) 

1 

 

  I

 

 

 

of the counties, the jail is not adjacent to the courthouse, requiring detainees to be transported by 
vehicle to court. In a small number (4%) of the counties that responded to the survey, there are 
multiple courthouses in the county, resulting in both transport by vehicle as well as being walked 
to the adjacent courthouse(s). 

Pretrial Detainees Held from Other Counties 

To understand the potential logistics of having pretrial detainees held in jail in one county, but 
having court cases in other counties, the survey asked Sheriffs if their county jail regularly 
houses pretrial detainees from other Illinois counties. Two-thirds (66%) of counties indicated 
that they do not regularly house pretrial detainees from other counties, while one-third (34%) of 
counties did house pretrial detainees from other counties.  

These patterns were confirmed through analyses of data collected through the Mid-year 2019 
Census of County Jails by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics. That 
census found that roughly one-third (35%) of jails in Illinois were housing detainees from other 
counties, while 65% were not. Further, through the jail census data, of those housing other 
county jail detainees, most (77%) held 10 or fewer mid-year 2019. 

Further, among those Sheriffs that reported housing pretrial detainees from other counties, just 
under one-half (44%) indicated that they transport those detainees to the courthouse in the county 
where they are being tried. 

Capacity for Pretrial Detainees to Participate in Video-Conferencing of Court Hearings from 
Jail 

When asked if the county jail currently has space and camera or computer equipment that allows 
for detainees to participate in video-conferencing of court hearings, 91% indicated this was the 
case. Of those that reported having space and equipment for video-conferencing of court 
hearings, roughly three-quarters (72%) indicated that this was through a web-based connection, 
while the remaining 28% reported the connection was through a direct-feed. 

Just over one-half (54%) of those reporting the use of video-conferencing of court hearings for 
jail detainees said this was implemented specifically because of COVID-19, while just under 
one-half (44%) reported the use of video-conferencing was not because of COVID-19. When 
asked if the use of video-conferencing would likely continue after COVID-19, among those 
reporting use of video-conferencing, roughly one-half (48%) did not answer yes or no, perhaps 
suggesting they are not sure or that the decision is not theirs to make. Of those that did answer 
the question, the vast majority—83%--said the use of video-conferencing would likely continue 
after COVID-19. Further, while most (77%) feel the space and equipment that allows for 
detainees to participate in video conferencing of court hearings is adequate, roughly one-quarter 
(23%) did not feel this was the case. 

Jail Information Technology Systems 

Given that part of the goal of the survey was to gauge what will be needed in order for AOIC to 
comply with 20 ILCS 3930/7.7, the survey also asked questions about the specific information 

2 

 

 

technology (IT) systems used by the jails, the age of those systems, planned changes to the IT 
systems, and the degree to which specific information needed to link data from jail systems to 
other information systems maintained by the court system existed. When it came to the specific 
vendor/system used by the jails, there was considerable variation across the 76 Sheriffs that 
responded to the survey and operated jails. For example, 12 (16%) reported using one-specific 
system, 9 (12%) reported using another specific system, 8 (10%) reported using another specific 
system, 2 reported not having an IT system for the jail, and the remaining 45 reported using one 
of at least 20 different IT systems by private vendors or created by local county IT departments. 

When it came to the length of time Sheriffs reported using their specific IT systems, roughly 
one-half (47%) reported using the current system for fewer than 10 years (27% reported less than 
5 years plus 19% reporting 5 to 9 years). On the other hand, just over one-half (53%) reported 
using their current IT system for 10 years or more (42% for 10 to 19 years plus 11% for 20-plus 
years). Only 18% of the county Sheriffs reported that they planned to replace their existing jail 
management information system in the next three years, while 15% indicated “maybe”, and 67% 
indicated “no.” 

The survey also asked respondents if specific individual/case-level identifiers were included in 
the jail information management system. Roughly one-half of respondents indicated that the 
state-police issued, fingerprint-based State Identification (SID) was captured in the jail 
information system, 64% reported that the court case number was captured, and 78% indicated 
that some type of locally generated identifier (e.g., inmate identification number, local defendant 
number) was included in their system. The availability of these identifiers will be critical given 
that the goal/expectation under 20 ILCS 3930/7.7 is to be able to link data/cases going through 
court (e.g., cases filed and disposed, cases going to a release conditions or detention hearing) to 
information regarding length of time in pretrial detention in jails. Further, while most counties 
reported including court case numbers in their jail information system, the degree to which these 
data fields are populated or formatted similar to that in the court systems remains to be 
determined. 

In almost one-half (45) of the counties that responded to the survey, no other agency staff from 
outside of the Sheriff’s Office (e.g., local police departments, County State’s Attorney, or 
County Probation Department) are able to access the jails management information system to 
find information beyond what is maintained on a publically accessible web-site. When staff 
external to the Sheriff’s Office were able to access the jail’s information system, it was usually 
local police departments (44% of jails allowed the local police department staff to access their 
information system), the State’s Attorney’s Office (37% of jails allowed the State’s Attorney or 
State’s Attorney staff to access their information system), or local probation departments (24% 
of jails allowed the probation department staff to access their information system). 

The survey also asked if the public is able to find information about individuals who are detained 
in each county’s jail through an internet-based portal (e.g., can they search by name, determine 
the charges against an individual and when they were admitted to the jail, etc.). Just under one-
half (45%) of the Sheriff’s Offices that responded indicated this was possible, while 55% 
reported it was not.

Survey of Illinois Sheriff’s Offices 
Regarding Jail Data 

 

urvey Introduction  

The purpose of this survey is to obtain information from the county sheriff’s offices in Illinois to 
assess their ability and capacity to provide data that the Administrative Office of the Illinois 
Courts (AOIC) is required to collect per Public Act (PA) 101-0652 (enacted February 22, 2021 
and referred to as the Pretrial Fairness Act, or PFA). Included in PA 101-0652 was the addition 
of 20 ILCS 3930/7.7, which requires AOIC to establish a Pretrial Practices Data Oversight 
Board, identify existing pretrial data collection processes in local jurisdictions, collect and 
maintain pretrial data from county justice agencies, determine the resources needed to achieve 
these goals, and regularly produce and publish analyses of these data.  
     
To assist AOIC in meeting these statutory requirements, the Pretrial Practices Data Oversight 
Board is soliciting information from all 102 county sheriff’s offices in Illinois to assess current 
data collection practices and management information system capacities as it relates to jail 
admissions, populations and exits.
