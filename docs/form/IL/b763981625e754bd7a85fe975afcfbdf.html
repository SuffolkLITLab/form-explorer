What types of cannabis offenses DO NOT qualify?

o  Convictions for any Class 3 felony, Class 2 felony, 
 
 

Class 1 felony, or Class X felony Cannabis offenses. 
  
o  A cannabis conviction not under section 4 or 5 of the

school grounds, cannabis trafficking, or possession 
of cannabis plants. 
 
o  Arrests or charges not leading to conviction. 
 
  
 
o  Court supervision or Qualified Probation that was 
 
 
successfully completed. These sentences are not 
 
convictions under Illinois law and qualify for 
 
expungement without a motion to vacate. 
  
 
o  Cannabis conviction records that are from out of 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state and federal court: Check with the state where

and expunged? 
 
The vast majority of dismissed cases and cases where 
supervision or “qualified probation” was satisfactorily 
 
completed may still be expunged, and misdemeanors 
 
and felonies may be sealed using a different form.

qualify, see How to Expunge and/or Seal Criminal 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

OVERVIEW TO VACATING AND 
 
 
EXPUNGING ELIGIBLE 
 
CANNABIS CONVICTIONS 
 
This page is an overview of the process. For more detail 
 
on the process, read the rest of the packet. 
 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more help and 
information, see newleafillinois.org. 
 
 
 
What does it mean to vacate and expunge my 
 
cannabis conviction? 
Some cannabis convictions are eligible to be vacated 
 
 
 
and expunged. To ‘vacate' a cannabis conviction means 
 
to set aside the finding of guilt, as if it did not happen. 
 
 
To ‘expunge’ means to erase the police and court 
 
records of the conviction. 
 
 
Why should I vacate and expunge my convictions? 
Vacating a conviction erases the legal effects of the 
 
conviction. This means: 
 
o  If your conviction is vacated, you can legally state 
 
that you do not have a conviction for that cannabis 
case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
o  If your only felony conviction is for an eligible Class 
4 felony cannabis conviction, and it is vacated, you 
 
  
are no longer a convicted felon. 

 

 

 

 

 
 
o  If you were barred from having a Firearm Owners 
Identification (FOID) Card due only to a Class 4 
 
felony cannabis conviction, and that conviction is 
 
vacated, you will then be eligible for a FOID Card. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What types of Convictions can be expunged using 
 
these forms? 
 
These types of convictions for cannabis offenses can be 
 
expunged: 
  
o  Convictions include a finding of guilt resulting in a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposition of: 
  
•  Probation (other than Qualified Probation, 
 
 

 

   
 

successfully completed), 
  

 

 

•  Jail or prison time, 
 
  
 
•  Conditional discharge, 
 
  
•  Time considered served, 
 
•  Fines (with no other sentence), and 
 
 
•  Supervisions or qualified probations that are 
 
 

 
not successfully completed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

NOTE: For definitions of the dispositions listed above, 
 
including the difference between probation and 
qualified probation, see page 14.

objection. If they object, it means they do not want 
 
your record to be vacated or expunged. 

   

What stops me from having my eligible cannabis 
conviction vacated and expunged? 
 
o  If you are still serving the sentence for the cannabis 
 
 

 

 

offense; OR 
 

sentence; OR 
 

o  If you have not completed all the conditions of the 
 
 

 

o  If you were also convicted of a non-cannabis offense 
 

 

 

in the same case 
•  For example, if in one case, you were convicted 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

of one count of misdemeanor cannabis 
 
possession, and one count of retail theft, the 
case is NOT eligible to be vacated and 
 
 
expunged. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The judge may deny your request. See “How does 
 
 
 
the judge decide to approve or deny my Motion to 
 
Vacate & Expunge Eligible Cannabis Convictions?” 
 
in Step 4 below. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
What if I have been convicted of an eligible cannabis
 
offense in more than one Illinois county? 
 
 
You will have to file a separate motion in each county. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If I need help filling out my form, where can I go? 
 
 
You may find more information, resources, and the 
location of your local legal self-help center at 
  
illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help/lshc-directory. 
 
 
What costs will I need to pay to expunge my criminal 
record? 
 
o  Criminal Record Fees:  If you are seeking to verify 
 
 
your records, there is a fee to get a copy of your 
 
RAP (Record of Arrests and Prosecutions) sheet 
 
from the Chicago Police Department. There is also a 
fee to get your Statewide Criminal History Transcript 
 
 
from the Illinois State Police. 
 

 

 

 

o  Circuit Clerk Filing Fee: To file your Motion to Vacate 
 
 
 
& Expunge form (unless waived). In certain places, a 
 
certified disposition fee may be required. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees which you 
can find at https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
 
and-forms/approved-forms/. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
How long will it take before I know if the court will 
 
grant my Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible 
 
Cannabis Convictions? 
  
It may take a few months to get a decision because: 
 
 
o  The county State’s Attorney gets a chance to object 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
to your Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible 
 
Cannabis Convictions. They have 60 days from the 
 
day they receive your Motion to file a written 

 

 
o  Courts are busy and it may take a while for a judge to 

 

 

 
review your Motion 

 

 

 

 

   

How do I vacate and expunge my cannabis 
 
conviction? 
 
To vacate and expunge an eligible cannabis conviction, 
you must file a Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible 
Cannabis Convictions. These instructions will guide you 
 
through the process. 
 
STEP 1: RESEARCH YOUR 
CRIMINAL RECORDS 
 
Why do I need to research my criminal records? 
 
 
Criminal records list the offenses you were arrested for, 
 
the offenses you were charged with, and the outcome of 
 
the cases including any convictions you received. You 
 
need this information to find out if you qualify to file a 
Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible Cannabis 
 
Convictions. 
 
 
What are the different types of criminal records? 
 
o  Court Disposition: The final judgment or outcome in 
 
a court case. There are no court dispositions for 
 
 
arrests or charges that did not lead to a court case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Chicago RAP Sheet (Record of Arrests and 
 
Prosecutions): List of all arrests, charges, and court 
 
 
case outcomes that happened in Chicago. 
 
o  Illinois State Police Statewide Criminal History 
 
 

Transcript: List of most arrests and convictions that 
 
happened in Illinois. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Where do I look for my criminal records? 
  
 
o  Get information from the Illinois State Police. 
 
You are allowed to access your entire criminal 
 
history from the Illinois State Police. Although not 
 
 
required, it is the best available source for your 
 
entire criminal record. Please note, there might be 
 
discrepancies or missing information. You can get a 
"Statewide Criminal History Transcript" in 1 of 3 
ways: 
 
●  Directly from the Illinois State Police: Illinois

●  You can also go to any licensed LiveScan 
 

 
vendor to get your transcript. Find a LiveScan 
 
vendor at: 
 
 
idfpr.com/LicenseLookUp/fingerprintlist.asp 
o  Get information from the Circuit Clerk. Many 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court records are available online. Other counties, 
 
like Cook County, do not provide online access to 
criminal records. In this case, go to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office in the county where your case was 
 
filed. Ask the Circuit Clerk for copies of your court 
 
dispositions or use the public computer at the 
 
courthouse to look them up and print them out. The 
 
Clerk may charge a fee for copies of your court 
 
 
 
dispositions. To save costs, you can look at 
 
dispositions on the clerk’s computer and write down 
 
 
the information. Find your Circuit Clerk's website at: 
 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
o  Get information from the Chicago Police 
 

 
Department. Order a RAP sheet from the Chicago 
 
Police Department if you were arrested in Chicago. 
 
There will be a fee to get your RAP sheet, and you 
will have to return around a week later to pick it up. 
 
●  Go to the Chicago Police Department to get your 
 

 

 

 

 

Chicago RAP sheet: 
 
Chicago Police Headquarters 
 
3510 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60653 
 
 
(312) 745-5508 
 
 

●  Ask for a copy of your Illinois State Police 
Statewide Criminal History Transcript. The 
 
Chicago Police will provide your state record at 
 
no extra cost. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

STEP 2: REVIEW YOUR 
 
CRIMINAL RECORDS TO SEE IF 
 
YOU QUALIFY 
 
What do I look for on my criminal record? 
 
To figure out if the cannabis convictions on your criminal 
 
record qualify to be vacated and expunged, you need to 
 
look at each item in your criminal record and find the: 
 
o  Arrest dates and the police department which 

 

 

 

 

arrested you; 
 

 
 
o  Charge: The type of offense you were charged with 

  
in court and the “class” of offense; 

 

 
 
o  Disposition: The outcome of the case, for example, 

 
guilty/not guilty; 

 

 
o  Sentence: The punishment you received; and, 
 
 
o  Date you completed any sentence. 
 
Once you find these on your criminal record, review the 
table on page 1 to see if your conviction qualifies to file a 
 
Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible Cannabis 
Convictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

STEP 3: FILL OUT THE MOTION

disposition for the “Type” of crime. There will be 
 
either an “F” for felony or “M” for misdemeanor. 
 
Then, look for the “Class” of misdemeanor or felony. 
  
Misdemeanors can have a Class A, B or C.  Felonies 
 
 
can have a Class X, 1, 2, 3 or 4. In most counties 
 
outside of Cook, felony offenses have a “CF” in the case 
number and misdemeanors have a “CM” in the number. 
 
[NOTE: You can also be convicted of a misdemeanor in 
 
a “CF” case.] 
 
For the purposes of this form, cannabis convictions for 
 
 
any Class misdemeanor and Class 4 felony may be 
 
eligible to vacate.  Examples of a conviction include: 
 
Fine Only, County Jail, Supervision Terminated 
Unsatisfactory, Conditional Discharge, 710, 1410, TASC 
 
or Second Chance Probation Terminated Unsatisfactory 
 
and Department of Corrections.

STEP 4: NEXT STEPS FOR 
 
MOTION TO VACATE & 
 
 
EXPUNGE ELIGIBLE CANNABIS 
 
CONVICTIONS 
 
What do I do after I fill out the form? 
 
Part A. File your form with the Circuit Clerk in the 
 
county where the eligible cannabis arrest, charge, 
 
 
and conviction occurred. 
 
o  In some counties, you may have to attach copies of 
 
 
your court dispositions. A “disposition” is a court 
 
record showing the outcome of the case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You may be able to file in person, by mail, or by e-
 
filing (filing electronically). Check with your Circuit 
 
 
Clerk to see how to file in your county. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  There may be a fee to file your Motion to Vacate & 
 
 
Expunge Eligible Cannabis Convictions. The Circuit 
 
 
Clerk can let you know the amount of the fee. Ask 
 
the Circuit Clerk and ask how much it will cost to file 
your forms and the types of payment (cash, check, 
 
credit, online) they take. 
 
o  If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
 
the court to pay for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
an Application for Waiver of Court Fees which you 
can find at: 
 
https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms/. 
 
 

 
How to File in Person 
o  Go to the courthouse in the county where you were 
 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested or charged with the offense. 
  

o  Give the Circuit Clerk your original form and the 
 

 

required number of copies to stamp. 
  

o  The Circuit Clerk will keep the original form and give 
 

back your copies. 
  
 

o  Pay the filing fee. If you cannot afford to pay the 
 
 

filing fee, you can ask the court to file for free or at a 
reduced cost by filing an Application for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
How to File by Mail 
o  If you are asking to file for free or at a reduced cost, 
 
 
there may be local rules requiring you to file your 
 
Application for Waiver of Court Fees in person. Ask 
 
 

  

 

 

 

o  Enter the extra cases on the Additional Cannabis 
 
 
Convictions form.” You can use more than one 
Additional form if needed.

that have passed since your last conviction(s). 
 
 Section 6: Explain why it is important to have your 
 
 
cannabis conviction(s) vacated and expunged. 
 
 
If you have been denied employment, housing, 
 
educational or other opportunities due to your cannabis 
 
conviction(s), describe the opportunities denied to you in 
as much detail as possible. 
   
o  For example, if you were denied a job and you were 
 
told that it was due to your cannabis convictions, 
 
 
explain that in this section. Or, if your application for 
 
 
a Firearm Owner’s Identification Card was denied 
due to your cannabis convictions, explain that in this 
 
section. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you have other reasons that you wish to vacate and 
expunge your cannabis convictions, list them in as much 
detail as possible. 
  
o  For example, if you are concerned about information 
 
 
regarding your cannabis convictions being available 
 
on the internet, explain that in this section.

How to E-file 
 
 
o  In counties that accept e-filing for criminal matters, 
you may electronically file (e-file) (you can go to 
 
efile.illinoiscourts.gov/active-courts.htm to see if your 
court accepts criminal e-filings) you may e-file the 
 
Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible Cannabis 
 
Convictions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

  
provider. 
•  Visit illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm to 
 

 

 

 

select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
  
help/how-to-e-file/. 
 
o  If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
  
terminal to e-file your forms. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 

  
a flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

  
that you can use to e-file your forms. 
 
o  The Circuit Clerk will mail your Motion with the 
 
Notice of Motion to the county State’s Attorney. 
 
o  Keep 1 copy of the form that was stamped by the 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Circuit Clerk for your own records. 
 

 

o  When you get your court date, the Circuit Clerk will 
 
send notice of the court date to the county State’s 
 
Attorney. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
How does the judge decide to approve or deny my 
Motion to Vacate & Expunge Eligible Cannabis 
 
Convictions? 
Requests are not automatically approved just because 
 
you are eligible under the law. To decide, the court may: 
 
 
o  Review any objections from the county State’s 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Attorney, 

 
o  Consider any response to the objections that you 

give in person at court or in writing; 

 

 

 

 
 
o  Determine if you are eligible under the law; AND 
 
 
o  Review other factors the judge is allowed to consider 
 
under the law, including: 
●  The reasons why the State wants to keep your 
 
 
records from being vacated and expunged; 

 

 

 

 

 

●  Your age now and at the time of the offense; 
 
●  The period of time between the conviction and 

 
 

 

 
the filing of the Motion; AND 

 

●  The specific negative results you may suffer if 
 
 
the Motion is denied. Be prepared to tell the 
 
judge about these. 
 

 

 
Get ready for your court date. 
 
 
 
o  Think about and write down specific negative results 
 
you may suffer if your Motion is denied (examples 
 
 
include denial of job or housing). 

 

 

 

 

 

 
o  Make copies of any court records that show you 
 
have an eligible cannabis conviction, such as the 
 
court disposition or sentencing order. If your court 
 
date is by phone or video, contact the Circuit Clerk 
and ask how you can get a copy of these items to 
 
the judge. You might have to e-file them like your 
 
other documents. 

 

 

 

 

 
 
o  Gather and make copies of other documents you 

 

 
want the judge to see, like evidence of completion of 
 
a treatment program, letters of recommendation, 
proof of education, or diplomas, etc. 

 
 

 

 

   

 
Attend your court date. 
 
 
o  You must attend the court date 
if one is scheduled. If you do not, 
the judge could enter an order or 
 
judgment against you. 
• 
 
 
video: 
 Make sure to have the call-in or 
 
 
login information for your court date 
and make sure your technology is 
 
working. 
 

 
If your court date is by phone or 

 

 


 

 

Follow the instructions on the court notice 
 
you received. Call the Circuit Clerk or Circuit 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part B. Ask for a court date. 
 
 
 
o  You may need to go to court 
 
 
for a court date in front of a 
 
judge. Some counties 
 
schedule a court date right 
 
away, but others will only 
 
schedule a court date if the 
 
county State’s Attorney 
  
objects to your Motion. 
o  If you need to schedule the 
 
 
court date, ask the Circuit 
 
Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may schedule 
the court date, or you may have to speak with other 
 
court staff. 

 

 

 

 

 

Make sure you know how you are to 
 
 
attend your court date. 

 

Your court date could be in person, by 
 
phone or by video. If it is by phone or video 
   
it is called a “Remote Appearance.” Call 
 
the Circuit Clerk or visit their website for 
 
more information. To find the phone 
number for your Circuit Clerk, visit


 
 Copies of all the documents you filed with

•  Arrive for your court date at least 15 minutes 
 
 
early. If you are going in person to court, add 
more time for going through security. 
 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

If your hearing is in person, find the courtroom 
number listed on your court form. If your forms 
 
do not have a courtroom number, look for a list 
 
of cases at the courthouse or ask the Circuit 
 
Clerk. 

   

 

 

•  You may need to check in with the courtroom 
 

staff. Then, wait for your name and case number 
 
 
to be called. 
  

•  When your case is called, introduce yourself to 
 
the judge. If you are attending by phone or 
 
video, remember to unmute yourself. 
 

 

 

 

 
 
How do I present my case to the judge? 
 
o  Tell the judge your side of the case and answer their 
 
 
 

 

 

 

questions. Be prepared to tell the judge about 
 
specific negative results you have suffered or may 
 
 
suffer if your Motion is denied. 
 

 

o  You will have a chance to respond to any objections 
 
 

 
to your Motion. 
 
 

o  The county State’s Attorney will be at your court date 
 

 

and could ask you questions about your case. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How will I find out if my Motion is granted or denied? 
 
The judge will either make a decision at the court date, 
 
inform you that the decision will be mailed to you, or give 
 
you a new court date to come back to learn the judge’s 
 
 
decision. 
 
What do I do with the Order granting or denying my 
 
Motion after I get it? 
 
o  If your Motion is granted, it is very important that you 
 
 
   
keep a copy of the Order that you receive from the 
 
Circuit Clerk in a safe place. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You should also send a copy to the Illinois State 
 
Police and law enforcement agency that arrested 
you. 
  

 

o  Once your arrests or cases are expunged or sealed, 
 
 
the Circuit Clerk no longer has a court record for you 
 

 

and it may be very difficult to get another copy of the 
Order. 

 

 
If my Motion is granted, how long will I have to wait
 
before my record is expunged? 
 
o  If the judge approves your Motion, you need to send 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a copy of the Order to the arresting police 
departments and Illinois State Police. Those 
agencies have 60 days from receipt of the Order to 
comply. 
  

 

 

 

 

 
How will I know when my record has been 
 
expunged? 
 
o  The Illinois State Police will send you a letter stating 
 
that they have expunged your record. Until you 
 
receive this letter from the Illinois State Police, your 
 
records have not yet been expunged. The Illinois 
 
State Police will also send a copy of the Order to the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI does 
 
not send verification that they have expunged your 
 
records; you may check that the FBI has expunged 
your records by getting an FBI background check at: 
 
fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-
 
checks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
o  The Circuit Clerk will remove your name from the 
 
public record. You can search your name and/or 
 
case number(s) in that county to make sure it 
 
happened. If it did not happen, contact your Circuit 
Clerk, and be prepared to show them a copy of the 
 
order granting your expungement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Can anyone find out about my cannabis conviction
 
 
once it has been vacated and expunged? 
 
An employer and members of the public cannot see 
expunged records or find out that you have had a record 
 
expunged.  However, some federal agencies will be able 
 
to see your expunged records. 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If my records are expunged, do I have to tell
 
potential employers or landlords about it? 
 
No, you do not have to tell employers or landlords about 
 
your vacated and expunged cannabis conviction. 
 
 
o  Your expunged records cannot be used against you. 
If they are, it may be a violation of the Illinois Human 
 
Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101-10/104 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
o  On job or rental applications you may answer “no” to 
 
the question, “have you ever been convicted” if your 
entire criminal record was expunged or sealed. 
 
 
NOTE: in Illinois, private employers may not ask on 
a job application if you have ever been arrested and 
 
charged with a crime. 
 

 
 
o  In Illinois, it is against the law for employers to ask if 
 
you have expunged or sealed any criminal records 
 
 
unless they are one of the agencies authorized by 
 
law to do so.

o  File a Petition for Executive Clemency: You can file 
 
 
a petition with the Prisoner Review Board requesting 
the Governor grant a pardon authorizing 
 
expungement. For more information, go to

If you filed a Motion to Vacate & Expunge 
Eligible Cannabis Conviction and the court has 
 
not yet decided your Motion, if asked, you still 
 
have to report your criminal record to a potential 
 
employer after an interview or conditional offer 
 
of employment. 
 

 

 

 

 

o  However, if you have other convictions on your 
 
 

 

criminal record in addition to the cannabis case, they 
 
still must be disclosed unless they are sealed or 
 
expunged. 
 

 

 

   

look at your Motion again. 
  
●  File a Motion for Reconsideration with the Circuit 
Clerk within 60 days from the day you received a 
copy of the Order denying your Motion. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
What can I do if my Motion is denied? 
 
 
o  Ask for Reconsideration: You can ask the judge to 
 

 
 

 

 

 

●  You may have to pay another filing fee unless 
 
you have a fee waiver. Send a copy of your 
 
 
Motion for Reconsideration and Notice of Motion 
 
forms to the county State's Attorney. 
 
 
If you file a Motion for Reconsideration and it is 
 
denied, file a Notice of Appeal within 30 days 
 
from the day the Order was entered denying 
 
your Motion for Reconsideration. 
 

● 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

o  Appeal: You can ask the appellate court to review 
 
 
the judge’s decision. You must file a Notice of 
 
Appeal within 30 days.  You may find the Notice of 
  
 
Appeal at  illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
 
forms/approved-forms. 
•  File a Notice of Appeal with the Circuit Clerk 
 
 
 
within 30 days from the day the Order was 
 
  
entered denying your Motion; 
•  You will have to pay a filing fee to the appellate 
 
court unless you have a fee waiver from the 
 
appellate court. There is another fee for the 
 
Circuit Clerk to prepare the Request for 
Preparation of Record on Appeal. Give the 
 
Circuit Clerk a copy of your Order for Waiver of 
 
Court Fees (if you have one) and pay your 
 
portion of the fees. You can find more 
 
information about Request for Preparation of 
 
Record on Appeal at 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
 
forms/approved-forms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
If you choose to appeal, the appellate court 
decision may become part of the public record, 
so even if you are ultimately successful in your 
 
expungement of your criminal records, the 
 
appellate case (including information on your 
 
expunged criminal record) will not be expunged. 
 

 

 

 

 
o  File to Seal: All cannabis conviction records are 

 

eligible for sealing in Illinois so long as the waiting 
 
 
period has passed. See Instructions on How to 
 
Expunge and/or Seal Criminal Records

o  There are three tables on page 14 of this instruction 
 
 
booklet to help you determine if a sentence or 
 
disposition qualifies as a conviction for the purposes 
 
 
of expungement and sealing. 
  

 

 

How do I complete the Case Worksheet? 
 
Using the information on your court dispositions and 
 
any RAP sheets you have, fill in your Case Worksheet 
 
 
with this information for each case: 
 
 
 
o  Case Number: Enter the case number listed on your 
 
court disposition or RAP sheet. 

 

 

 

 

 
o  Arresting Agency: Enter the name of the police 

 

 

 
department that arrested you. 

 
 
 
o  Charge: Enter all offenses you were charged with for 
 
 
each case number, for example “possession of 
 
cannabis” and “possession of drug paraphernalia.” 

 

 

 

o  Misdemeanor or Class of Felony: Enter whether each 
 
charge was a misdemeanor or, the class of felony. 
 
For example, if the charge is a class B misdemeanor, 
 
enter as a "misdemeanor".  If the charge is a class 3 
felony, enter as a "class 3 felony". 
 

 

 

 

 

 
o Date of Arrest: Enter the date you were arrested that 
 
 
is listed on your court disposition or RAP sheet 
o  Outcome: See Tables 1, 2, and 3 below for types of 
 
 

 

 

 
outcomes. 
 

o  Conviction (Y/N): The types of outcomes listed in 
 
Table 3 are convictions. 
 

 

o  Completion of Sentence: Enter the date your 
 
 

 

sentence ended. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

What if I see an arrest on my criminal record but 
 
there is no charge, disposition or sentence listed? 
 
Not all arrests lead to charges, so there may not be a 
 
charge, disposition, or sentence listed on your record. 
 
Since there was no conviction involved, this is not the 
proper form to use. See Instructions on How to 
 
Expunge and/or Seal Criminal Records at 
 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-forms 
for more information on expunging such cases.

How do I know if I was “convicted” of an eligible 
 
Cannabis offense and can use this form? 
 
The disposition (outcome) of the offense on your record 
 
tells you if you were convicted or not. The tables below 
explain what the disposition codes or descriptions on 
 
your record mean and if you were convicted or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
o  If you see the disposition for your offense on 
 

 
Table 1 on page 14 then you were not convicted 
 
for that offense. Offenses without convictions 
 
may be expunged, but require a different form. 
 
 
See Instructions on How to Expunge and/or Seal 
 
 
Criminal Records at 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
 
forms/approved-forms for more information on 
   
expunging such cases. 

 

 
If you are uncertain of the type or class of your 
 
conviction, contact the Circuit Clerk of the county 
where you were convicted. 
 

 

 
o  If you see the disposition for your offense on Table 2 
 
on page 14, then you were convicted of that offense 
 
but you have an exception that allows you to apply for 
expungement on a different form. See Instructions on 
 
 
How to Expunge and/or Seal Criminal Records at 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms for more information on expunging such cases 
  

 

 

 

 

 
o  If you see the disposition for your offense listed on 
 
Table 3 on page 14, you were convicted of that 
 
offense. If you were convicted of a misdemeanor or 
Class 4 felony cannabis offense, it can be vacated 
and expunged using this form only. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If I was arrested and charged with a Felony Class X, 
 
1, 2, 3 Cannabis offense that ended in a conviction, 
 
can I vacate and expunge? 
 
The only way you would be eligible to vacate and 
expunge the case is if the court amended and reduced 
 
your Cannabis charge to a Class 4 felony or 
 
misdemeanor conviction. 
 
o  On your RAP Sheet, disposition or other court 
 
 
 

 

 

 

documents, if you see “charge amended,” “charge 
reduced” or “amended to misdemeanor,” your 
 
cannabis conviction may be able to be vacated and 
expunged. If you are uncertain of the type or class of 
 
your conviction, the Circuit Clerk of the county where 
 
you were convicted.

The State has the option to bring the case back up again. If they do not within 120 – 
 
  
160 days, the case is considered dismissed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The court kept your case open for a set period of time, and because you followed all 
 
of the conditions during that time, the court dismissed the criminal charges against 
 
 
 
you. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This type of probation can also be called 410, 710, 1410, or TASC probation when 
the court determines the arrest was a result of alcohol or drug addiction, and must 
 
be reflected in the record. You can tell if you received this special type of probation 
 
 
 
by the court disposition. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Table 2: These dispositions/outcomes mean that you were convicted, but there is a special situation and are 
 
eligible for expungement.  However, these dispositions are NOT eligible for A Motion to Vacate & Expunge

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
