HOW TO ASK THE JUDGE TO WAIVE CRIMINAL COURT 
 
  
ASSESSMENTS 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
What are criminal court assessments? 
  
 
Assessments are costs charged to a defendant in a 
criminal case once found guilty. They do not include 
fines or restitution ordered by the judge to be paid by the 
 
 
 
defendant. They also do not include costs in civil and 
 
 
juvenile cases and fee assessments resulting from 
 
violations of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The waiver may 
 
not apply to some court costs and fees associated with 
your case. 
 
 
 
Who can ask the judge to waive a criminal court
 
assessment? 
 
Anyone who must pay an assessment as part of a court 
 
case. You can ask for yourself or a minor child, but not 
 
for anyone else. 
  
 
How will I know if there is an assessment? 
 
You will get a document that tells you if you owe an 
   
assessment. 
  
 
What forms do I need to fill out to ask the judge to 
 
 
waive or reduce assessments? 
 
o  Application for Waiver of Criminal Court 
 
 
 

How do I prove I cannot afford to pay court 
 
assessments? 
 
The judge may require you to prove the information in 
 
your Application. If you get public benefits you may want 
 
 
to bring current proof of eligibility and a benefits 
 
 
 
statement from the agency providing the benefit. 
 
 
Examples of public benefits are: 
 
o  Supplemental Security Income (SSI, Not Social 
 
 
 

o  Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) 
 
 
o  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) 
  
 
o  SNAP (Food Stamps) 
 
 
o  General Assistance (GA) 
 
 
 
o  Transitional Assistance; State Children and Family 
 
 
 
 

If you don't get public benefits, you may want to bring 
documents showing your income, value of belongings 
 
 
(for example, real estate), and expenses. 
 
 
Can the judge make me pay back assessments after
 
I have been granted a waiver? 
 
 
If the judge grants your Application and later decides 
 
 
that the information you put in your Application was 
 
 
false, the judge can make you pay any assessments that 
 
were waived. 
 

 
Assessments:  Is used to tell the judge whether you 
get any public benefits and your income and 
 
expense information so they can decide if you are 
eligible for a waiver of court fee assessments. 
 
 
o  Order for Waiver of Criminal Court Assessments: 
 
 
Is used by the judge to say your application is 
 
 
granted or denied.

What happens if my Application is granted? 
 
Depending upon your circumstances, the judge may 
order that: 
 
 
o  All of your assessments are waived; 
 
 
o  You must pay 25% of any assessment; 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 50% of any assessment; OR 
 
 
 
 
o  You must pay 75% of any assessment. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

             

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
 
address you put on the forms is where important 
 
 
legal documents will be sent to you. You should use 
an email account that you do not share with anyone 
else and that you check every day. If you do not 
 
 
check your email every day, you may miss important 
 
 
information, notice of court dates, or documents from 
 
 
other parties.

that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for 
  
 
an exemption from e-filing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

â€¢  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
  
available. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

â€¢ 
 

 

 

 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

â€¢  File the original and 4 copies of your forms and 
 
the Certification with the trial court clerkâ€™s office 
 
in person or by mail. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 2: Wait for a decision. 
o  The judge will review your Application for Waiver of 
 
 
 
 
Criminal Court Assessments and decide whether 
 
 
you have to pay the assessments. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The judge may need more information from you. If 
 
   
 
 
so, the judge may want to have a hearing on your 
 
Application. The judge will notify you if you need to 
 
give more information or documents, or go to see 
 
the judge. 
 

o  After the judge makes a decision, the judge will fill 
 
 
 
 
out the Order for Waiver of Criminal Court 
 
 
Assessments. The Order for Waiver of Criminal 
 
 
Court Assessments will say if you have to pay any 
   
assessments. 

 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

o 
 

o  The Circuit Clerk will tell you how and when you will 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
get a copy of the Order for Waiver of Criminal Court 
 
Assessments. 
 
If the judge decides you have to pay all or some of 
 
the court assessments, they also may allow you to 
 
 
defer payment to a later date, make installment 
 
payments, or make payment upon other terms and 
 
 
conditions stated in the order.  If you fail to pay as 
 
ordered by the judge, the matter may be referred for 
 
collection, a Petition to Revoke the Sentence may 
   
 
be filed, or the judge may hold you in contempt. If 
 
you are sentenced to probation, conditional 
discharge, or supervision and fail to pay the 
assessment before the end of your sentence, the 
 
 
court could extend your period of probation, 
 
 
 
conditional discharge, or supervision until you pay 
 
the assessment. 
If a cash bond has been posted in the case, then the 
     
cash bond may be used to pay the assessments if it 
 
has not been applied to other fines or fees

What do I do after I fill out the Application for Waiver 
 
of Criminal Court Assessments and Order for Waiver 
 
of Criminal Court Assessments? 
 
 
Step 1: File the Application and Order with the 
 
Circuit Clerk in the county where the charges were 
filed. 
 
o  The courthouse address should be on the court 
 
 
papers you received. Or, you can find the 
 
courthouse address, online, 
 
 
at: illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
 
 
clerks/. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

o  Make a copy of your original Application for yourself. 
 
 
 
o  The Circuit Clerk will stamp and keep the original. 
 
 
 
o  How to File in Person 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

â€¢  Go to the courthouse in the county where your 
 
 

 

 

court case is filed. 
 

 

 

 

â€¢  Give the Circuit Clerk your original forms and 
 
 
 
the copies to stamp. 
 
 
â€¢  The Circuit Clerk will keep the original forms 
 
  
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and give back your copies. 
 
 
o  How to File by Mail 
 
 
 
 
 
 

â€¢ 
 

 

 

If you do not need to appear in person, mail 
 
your Application and Order and one copy of 
 
each to the Circuit Clerk. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

â€¢ 
 

Include a self-addressed and stamped 
envelope for the Circuit Clerk to mail the file 
 
stamped copy back to you. 
 
 
o  How to electronically file (E-file) 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

â€¢ 
 

â€¢ 
 

â€¢ 
 

â€¢ 
 

 

 

 

In counties that accept e-filing for criminal 
 
 
matters (you can go to 
efile.illinoiscourts.gov/active-courts.htm to see if 
 
your court accepts criminal e-filings) you may 
 
electronically file (e-file) the Application and 
 
 
 
Order with the trial court. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To e-file, create an account with an e-filing 
 
 
service provider. 
  

 

 

 
 

Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-
 
 
providers.htm to select a service provider. 
 
Some service providers are free while others 
charge a processing fee. For instructions on 
 
how to e-file for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see 
 
the self-help user guides here: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/how-to-e-file/ 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   
If you do not have access to a computer or if 
 
you need help e-filing, take your form to the 
Circuit Clerkâ€™s office where you can use a 
 
 
public computer terminal to e-file your forms. 
 
You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 
a flash drive. The terminal will have a scanner 
 
and computer that you can use to e-file your 
 
form.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
