      <pre>HOW TO SERVE A SUMMONS 
  
Where will I receive court papers? 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
you put on the form is where important legal documents 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
will be sent to you. You should use an email account that 
 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
you do not share with anyone else and that you check 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
every day. If you do not check your email every day, you 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
may miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
documents from other parties. 
 
What is a Summons and when do I use it? 
 
 
 
o  A Summons is a court paper that tells a person they 
How do I fill out my Summons? 
 
are being sued. It tells them where and when to 
o 
 
respond to the lawsuit. 
   
o  When you file a lawsuit against someone, you must 

If you are suing more than 1 Defendant, complete a 
separate Summons for each Defendant. 
 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The Summons must include your contact information 
and the address where the Defendant can be served 
with the Summons. 
 

o  Ask the Circuit Clerk for the court date, time, and 

 

location (including courtroom or phone or video 
conference information) and enter that date in 
Section 4. 
  

o  Ask the Circuit Clerk for the phone number and 

 

website for their office to list in Section 4 
 

 

o  To find the phone number for your Circuit Clerk, visit 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/ 
 
 
If you are suing a business: 

o 
 

 

•  First, find out if it is incorporated. Do this by 
 
 

 

 

going to the Illinois Secretary of State’s website 
at 
cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/business_ser 
vices/corp.html. If you find the business in the 
database, look for the full legal name of the 
business. 
 

 

•  The business may also have a Registered 
 
Agent. A Registered Agent is a person or 
company who agrees to accept legal papers for 
 
an Illinois business. If a business has a 
Registered Agent, you must serve the 
Registered Agent. 
 

•  Put the name of the business and the name of 
 
 
the Registered Agent, if any, on the Summons 
below “Defendant’s address and service 
information.” 
 

 

 

•  Second, if the business is not in this database, 
 

 

you must serve the owner. The owner can be 
served at their place of business or home. Put 
 
the name of the owner on the Summons below 
 
“Defendant’s address and service information.” 
 

 

 
What do I do after I fill out the form? 
 
Step 1: File your Summons and Complaint/Petition 
 
with the Circuit Clerk in the county where your court 
case should be filed. 
  
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fill out a Summons. You must have it delivered to the 
person you are suing. This is called serving the 
 
Summons. You must also serve a copy of the 
Complaint/Petition. The person you are suing is 
called the Defendant/Respondent. 
  

 

 

o  The judge in your case cannot decide your case until 
 

 

you have had the Summons properly served. 
  

 

 
What if I am suing more than one person? 
 
o 
 

 

If you are suing more than 1 person, every person 
you are suing has to be served. You must name 
them all on your Summons. 
 
If you are suing more than 1 person in your case, 
 
attach an Additional Defendant/Respondent Contact 
Information form to your Summons. 
 

 

o 
 

 

 

Complaint/Petition proves that your Summons and 
 
 
Complaint/Petition were served on the 
 
Defendant/Respondent. 
 
o  The sheriff or process server will fill out the Proof of 

   

 

 

Service of Summons and Complaint/Petition. 

 

 

o 
 

 
Is there a cost to serve a Summons? 
 
 
o  You must pay the sheriff or process server who 
 
 

 
 

 

 

serves the Summons for you. 
 
If you cannot afford to pay the fees, you can apply 
for a fee waiver. Fill out the Application for Waiver of 
 
Court Fees. This is a separate set of forms you can 
find at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 
 
 

 

 

 
 

What forms do I need to fill out? 
 
o  The Summons. 
 
o  The Letter to the Sheriff. 
 
 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms. 
 
 

 

 
What is a Proof of Service of Summons and 
 
Complaint/Petition? 
 
o  The Proof of Service of Summons and

SU-I 1502.2 
 
 

▪
 

Pay the sheriff’s fees for each party OR mail
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver of
 
Court Fees.
 

 

o If any party does NOT live in the same county or

 

 

 

 

state where the case was filed:
 

• Get the name, address, and telephone number
 

of the sheriff for the county or the state where
that party lives.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

▪
 

▪
 

• Call the sheriff in that county or state to find out:
 
 
If it is the correct sheriff’s department for the
address where you want that party served;
 
The address where you should bring or mail
your Summons and forms; 
 
The number of copies of your Summons and
 
forms to bring or send; AND
 
 
The sheriff’s fees for service if they will honor
 
 
your Order for Waiver of Court Fees (if you
have one).

▪
 

▪
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 3: Confirm the sheriff served your form on the 
other party. 
  
o After the sheriff serves the other party with your

 

 

 

 

 

 

court forms, they will fill out the Proof of Service of
 
Summons and Complaint/Petition section of your
Summons form. Then they will file it with the Circuit
 
Clerk OR mail it to you.

 
o If the sheriff mails the Summons with the completed
 
Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint/Petition
to you, make a copy for yourself. Then file the
 
original with the Circuit Clerk, and have the Clerk file
stamp your copy.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o If you do not receive a Proof of Service of Summons
in the mail from the sheriff, you can call the Circuit
Clerk to see if it has been filed and how to get a
copy.

   

 

 

o If the sheriff is not able to serve the other party, ask
them why. You should try to fix the problem and fill
out another Summons. Then ask the sheriff to try to
serve the other party again.

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 4: Going to Court 
 
o Once the sheriff serves your form to the other party,
they will have a deadline to file a response with the
 
Circuit Clerk. The deadline will be on the Summons.
 
o If you do not get a copy of the other party’s response
 
by the deadline, call the Circuit Clerk to ask if there is
 
a response in the file. If there is, ask the Circuit Clerk
to send you a copy. You can also go to the Circuit
Clerk’s office to pick it up.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o If the other party files a response, you may then ask
 

 

for a court date.

  

 

o After the deadline, you may ask the court for a date
whether or not the other party filed a response.

 

 

you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  

•

 

•

 

•

 

You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do
not have internet or computer access at home
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a
place where you could use a computer; (2) you
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you
were unable to complete the process because
the equipment or assistance you need is not
available.

  

 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

 

 

 

 

File the original and 1 copy of your Summons
and the Certification with the Circuit Clerk’s
 
office in person or by mail.
 

 

 

o To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service

 

 

 

provider.
 
• Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm
 
to select a service provider. Some service
providers are free. Others charge a processing
fee. For instructions on how to e-file for free with
Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help user guides
here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/how-to-e-file/.

 

 

 

 

o If you need help e-filing, take your forms to the
 

Circuit Clerk’s office. They have a public computer
terminal to e-file your forms.

  

 

 

 

•

 

•

 

You can bring your forms on paper or saved on
a flash drive.

 

The terminal will have a scanner and computer
that you can use to e-file your form.

 

 

 
Step 2: Serve the other party with copies of your 
form. 
 
o Have the sheriff or a private process server serve
the Summons. You cannot serve the Summons
yourself.

  

 

 

o Staple the Summons to the front of the copy of your

 

 

 

forms that will go to the other party.

 

 

 

   

Bring copies of your Summons and your forms
to the sheriff’s office in person. Pay the sheriff’s
fees for each party OR give the sheriff a copy of
your Order for Waiver of Court Fees.
 
 

• Mail copies of your Summons and your forms to
 

•

 

 

o Do one of the following:
 
 

the sheriff
▪
 

  

▪
 

 

Include the Letter to the Sheriff found at:
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms.
 
Include a self-addressed and stamped
envelope for the sheriff to mail the Proof of
Service of Summons and Complaint/Petition
to you.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
