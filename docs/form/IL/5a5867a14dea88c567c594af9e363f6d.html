HOW TO CHANGE YOUR NAME (for an Adult) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the forms? 
 
 
Step 1: File the forms with the court where you live. 
o  Find the courthouse in the county where you live: 
illinoiscourts.gov/circuitcourt/circuitmap/map1.asp 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; or (2) 
you have trouble reading or speaking in English. 

 

 

 

 

 

• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default.asp. 
•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 

 

 

 

the Certification, with the Circuit Clerk’s office in 
 
person or by mail. 

o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 

 

o 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
user guides here: 
illinoiscourts.gov/CivilJustice/Resources/Self-
Represented_Litigants/self-represented.asp 
If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
terminal to e-file your forms. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 

 

a flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 

 

 

 

that you can use to e-file your forms. 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Step 2: Ask for a court date. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically. 
If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
with other court staff. 

o 

 

 

 

 
You may ask the court to waive the notice and 
 
publication requirement if: 
o  You believe that publishing notice will put you at
risk of physical harm or discrimination; OR 
o  You have or have previously been granted a 
 

protective order. 

If this applies, skip Step 3 and Step 4 and follow 
 
Step 5. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Skip Step 3, Step 4, and Step 5 and go to Step 6 if 
you have received a Judgment for Dissolution of 
 
 
Marriage or Declaration of Invalidity of Marriage and 
 
you are asking to change your name back to your 
 
former or maiden name. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 3: Publish your Publication Notice of Court 
 
Date for Request for Name Change in a newspaper 
 
in the county where you live once a week for 3 
 
 
weeks in a row. 
o  Contact a newspaper in your county and set up 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

o 

publication of the notice. 
If there is no newspaper in your county, contact a 
convenient newspaper published in Illinois. 

 
o  Give a copy of the Publication Notice of Court Date 
for Request for Name Change to a newspaper. 
o  The Notice must appear in a newspaper for the first 
time at least 6 weeks before your court date. 
o  Newspapers may charge you a publication fee. 
o 
 

If you have an Order for Waiver of Court Fees giving 
you a full or partial fee waiver in your court case, the 
newspaper is not required to waive or reduce your 
fee for publication. You will need to file a Motion 
asking the court to order the county to pay the cost 
of publication. You can find the Motion form at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 4: Get a Certificate of Publication from the 
 
 
newspaper and file it with the court. 
o  After the Notice appears in a newspaper for 3 
 
weeks, get a Certificate of Publication from the 
newspaper. 

 

 

 

 

o  Ask the newspaper how you will get the Certificate. 

 

 

The newspaper will either: 
•  Send the Certificate directly to the Circuit Clerk; 
•  Mail the Certificate to you; OR 
•  Tell you to pick up the Certificate in person. 
o  File the Certificate of Publication with the Circuit 
 

 

 

 

Clerk before your court date. 
If the newspaper sends the Certificate directly to the 
Circuit Clerk, make sure it arrives before your court 
date and ask the newspaper to send you a copy. 

 

 

o 

Skip Step 5 and go to Step 6 if you have published 
 
notice.

Order to change your name on records like your 
 
birth certificate, social security card, and a driver’s 
 
license. 
 

 

o  There may be a fee for the certified copies. 
 
 

 

 

 

Step 5: Ask the court to excuse you from publishing 
 
notice. 
 
o  File the Motion to Waive Notice & Publication with 
 

 

 

the Circuit Clerk. 
 

o  Ask for a court date for your Motion to Waive Notice 
 

 

 

 
& Publication. 
o  You must convince the judge that: 
 
 

•  You have or have had an Order of Protection, 
 
 

 

Stalking No Contact Order, Civil No Contact 
 
Order, Protective Order issued in someone 
else’s criminal case; 
  

 

 

•  You are or have been a protected person under 
 
 

someone else’s bail conditions; OR 
 

 

•  Publication would put you at risk of physical 
 
 

harm or discrimination. 
 

 

o  You should gather and make copies of documents 
 
 
you want the judge to see. If you want the judge to 
hear from other people, those people will have to 
 
come to court and be witnesses. 
 

 

 

 

o  Go to your court date. Bring your evidence and a 
 
 
completed Order on Motion to Waive Notice & 
 
Publication. 
 
 

 

 

Step 6: Go to your court date to ask the court to
 
change your name. 
 
o  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 
•  Photo I.D.; 
 
 
•  Stamped copies of: Request for Name Change, 
 
 
Publication Notice of Court Date for Request for 
 
Name Change (if it applies), and Certificate of 
 
Publication (if it applies); 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Proposed Order for Name Change; 
 
• 
 

Judgment for Dissolution of Marriage or 
 
Declaration of Invalidity of Marriage (if it applies) 
 
AND 
 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Other papers related to your Request (like 
 
 
papers showing that at least 10 years have 
passed since completion and discharge of your 
 
sentence). 
 

 

 

o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
 
 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
 
 

 

o 
 

form. 
  
If your forms do not have a courtroom number, look 
 
for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the Circuit 
 
Clerk. 

 

 

 

   

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

name and case number to be called. 
 

o  You may be placed under oath, answer the judge’s 
 
 

 

questions truthfully. 
 

o  The judge will either GRANT or DENY your Request. 
 
The judge will write this on the Order and sign it. 
 
 
If GRANTED, get certified copies of the Order from 
the Circuit Clerk. You need a certified copy of the 
 

o

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
