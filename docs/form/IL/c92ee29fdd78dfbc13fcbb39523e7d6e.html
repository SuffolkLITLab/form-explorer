Notice to Employer 
 
 

Enter the Case Number given by the Circuit Clerk: _________________________________ 
 

 

 

 

 

• 

• 

• 

If you do not answer or come to the court date listed in section 2, the judge may do one of two things: 

 

 

 

o 
Issue a rule to show cause; OR 
o  Enter a conditional judgment. 

 

If there is a rule to show cause court date, you will have to explain why you did not come to court on the court 
date and why you should not be found in contempt of court. If you do not come to the rule to show cause on the 
set court date, the judge may find you in contempt, and you might be arrested and jailed. 
If the court enters a conditional judgment, you will have 30 days to answer or appear. If you fail to do so, then 
the court may enter a final judgment against you. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  The employer’s duties and obligations: 

a.  Fill out and return the Answer on page 4 on or before the court date listed on page 1. 
 

 

 

 

 

The Answer asks basic questions about the debtor and their income. 
 

b.  The first question in the Answer is whether the debtor is employed by you or works for you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

under some other contractual relationship. 
i. 
 
ii. 

If they do not, then check the “No” box, and send the form back. 
If the debtor does work for you, answer the rest of the Answer about pay 
periods, hourly wage, gross pay, and required deductions from gross pay. 
The Answer explains how to calculate the amount you need to withhold for the 
garnishment/turnover order. 
If a positive amount is listed on section 4M on the Answer, withhold that amount until 
 
there is a court order to turn over the wages or the Citation is dismissed. 
If income varies, withholding must be recalculated for every pay period. 
c.  Sign the form, file the original with the Circuit Clerk who issued the Citation, and keep 
 

 
a copy for yourself. Give or send a copy of the completed Answer to the debtor and to the 
creditor. 

iv. 

iii. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

d.  Do not withhold any wages from the debtor if the debtor’s income after taxes is equal to or 
 
less than 45 times (x) the federal or Illinois minimum wage, whichever is greater.  Illinois 
minimum wage will increase between January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2025. See the 
Exempt Wages Table on the last page of this form to determine what wages are 
exempt based on the current minimum wage.  If the debtor’s wages after taxes are 
 
more than this exemption, then you should withhold either (1) 15% of the debtor’s 
gross income or (2) the debtor’s income after taxes minus the exemption, whichever is 
less. See how to calculate the amount in the Answer. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Do not turn over any funds until you receive a wage deduction/turnover order. 

 

 

 

4.  Certification by the creditor: 

 

a.  A judgment was entered or renewed against 

 

Name 
 

the debtor, on 

   

. 

 
Date 

, 
 

b.  The amount of the judgment is  $ 
c.  The current amount that remains to be paid, including the creditor's court costs and post-
judgment interest, minus any payment made by the debtor or on behalf of the debtor 
  
 
 
plus costs of this proceeding. 
 
after the judgment was entered, is  $ 
 
 

. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In 4a, enter the name of 
 
the debtor and the date 
 
of the judgment. If the 
 
judgment has been 
 
renewed (“revived”), 
 
enter that date. 
 

   

 
 
In 4b, enter the amount 
 
of the judgment. 

 
 

 

 

 

In 4c, enter how much 
 
is still owed to you. 
 
You are entitled to the 
 
judgment amount, court 
 
costs (like filing fees, 
 
service fees, sheriff's 
 
fee, etc.), and post-
judgment. Subtract any 
 
payments made by the 
debtor.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
