      <pre> 
Does it cost to file a Emergency Motion to Claim 
 
Exemption? 
o	  There may be a fee for filing an Emergency Motion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Claim Exemption with the Circuit Clerk. 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
 
the court to file for free. Fill out the Application for 
Waiver of Court Fees to ask the court for a fee 
waiver. This is a separate set of forms you can find 
at: http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 

 

 

 

o	 

 

 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the Emergency Motion to
 
 
Claim Exemption?
 
 
Step 1: File your forms with the Circuit Clerk in the
 
 
county where the court case is filed.
 
  
o	  Ask the Circuit Clerk for a court date, time, and 
 

courtroom number for your Emergency Motion to 
Claim Exemption. This is the time and place your 
Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption will be heard 
 
by a judge. 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  Write the courthouse address, court date, time, and 
courtroom number on the Notice of Court Date for 
Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption. 

 

 

o	  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless you qualify for an exemption from e-filing. 
 
•	  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer, (2) you 
have a disability that keeps you from e-filing, or 
 
 
(3) you have trouble reading or speaking 
English. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

•	  Fill out a Certification for Exemption from E-

 

Filing found here: 
www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default. 
asp. 

•	  File the original and 1 copy of your Motion 
 
form, and the Certification, with the Circuit 
Clerk’s office in person or by mail. 

o	  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

provider. 
•	  Visit http://efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service­
 

 

providers.htm to select a service provider. Some 
service providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. 

 

 

•	  For instructions on how to e-file for free with 

 

Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help user guides 
here: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/CivilJustice/Resour 
ces/Self-Represented_Litigants/self­
represented.asp 

 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
You can find the forms at: 
 
 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 

Who can file an Emergency Motion to Claim 
 
Exemption? 
 
Anyone who has a money judgment against them and 
 
whose bank account has been frozen as a result of that 
 
judgment can file an Emergency Motion to Claim 
Exemption. Your bank account may have been frozen if a 
creditor filed a Citation against your bank. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What is an Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption? 
 
You can file an Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption to 
 
 
get access to the money in your bank account for an 
emergency purpose. An emergency purpose may include a 
 
need to pay for your basic necessities like food, 
 
rent/mortgage, utilities, etc. You do this by claiming the 
 
 
 
money is protected by law (“exempt”) in your Motion. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How do I know if my money is exempt? 
 
The following money is exempt: 
 
 
o	  Social Security, SSI benefits, and disability 
o	  Pension and retirement benefits and refunds 
 
o	  Public assistance benefits 
o	  Child support 
o	  Unemployment compensation benefits 
o	  Workers' compensation benefits 
o	  Veterans' benefits 
o	  Circuit breaker property tax relief benefits 
 
o	  Any other source, up to $4,000 ("wildcard exemption") 
 

 

  
Who do I notify? 
You notify the judgment creditor (or their attorney if they 
 
have one) and the bank that is holding your frozen account. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

What forms do I need for the Emergency Motion to 
 
 
Claim Exemption? 
 
o	  Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption: This form 
asks the court to allow access to the money in your 
bank accounts because the money is protected by law 
 
and removes the bank from your case. 

 
o	  Notice of Court Date for Emergency Motion to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Claim Exemption: The form tells the judgment creditor 
 
and your bank that you have filed an Emergency 
Motion to Claim Exemption. It also states the date, 
time, and place where the judge will hear this Motion. 
o	  Order on Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption: 
This form is used by the judge to make a decision 
about whether to allow you access to the money in your 
 
 
bank account. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fill out the Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption and 
 
follow the instructions on the form. You will need the 
addresses for the judgment creditor and your bank to notify 
 
them. See Step 2.

HOW TO DO AN EMERGENCY MOTION TO CLAIM 
 
 
 
EXEMPTION 
 

 

 

 

 

                                                         

 

o	 
 

 

If you do not have access to a computer, or if you need 
help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit Clerk’s office 
 
 
where you can use a public computer terminal to e-file 
 
your form. 
 
•	  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

flash drive.
 
  

•	  The terminal will have a scanner and computer that
 
 
 

 
you can use to e-file your form.
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
Step 2: Serve notice to the judgment creditor and your 
 
bank regarding your Emergency Motion to Claim 
  
Exemption. 
o	  The judgment creditor and bank must receive notice of 
 
 
your Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption. A hearing 
 
on the Motion cannot take place unless this notice is 
  
given. 

 

 

 

 

o	  Give the judgment creditor and bank copies of the 
 

 
Notice of Court Date for Emergency Motion to Claim 

Exemption and your Emergency Motion to Claim 

 
Exemption.
 
 

 

 

o	  Because there may not be enough time to mail these 
 
 
 
forms, you should either hand-deliver, fax, or email 
  
these forms to the judgment creditor and your bank. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 3: Go to your court date. 
o	  Your court date, time, and room number are listed on 
 
your Notice of Court Date for Emergency Motion to 
Claim Exemption. 
 

 

 

 

o	  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 

•	  A file-stamped copy of the Emergency Motion to
 
 
 

 

 

Claim Exemption.
 
  

•	  Order on Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption. 
 
 

 

 

 

 
Complete the top part of this form only. 

•	  Copies of the Notice of Court Date for Emergency
 
 
 
Motion to Claim Exemption given to the judgment
 
 
creditor and your bank with the Proof of Delivery
 
 
signed by you showing when and how they got
 
 
notice.
 
 

 

 

 

 

•	  Any proof that shows the funds in your bank
 
 
 
 

 
account are exempt as you claim.
 
 
o	  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
 
 
 
 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court form. If 
your forms do not have a courtroom number, look for a 
  
list of cases at the courthouse or ask the Circuit Clerk. 
 
 
o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your name 

 

 

 

 

 
and case number to be called. 

 
o  When your case is called, step up, introduce yourself to 
 
 
the judge and tell the judge you want them to grant your 
Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
o  Explain to the judge the reasons you are claiming your 
 
exemption and provide the judge with any proof you 
 
 
have to show your funds are exempt. 
 

 
 
 
o  If the judge grants your Motion, give the Order on 

  
Emergency Motion to Claim Exemption to the judge. 
 
 
o  Before you leave the courtroom, get a file-stamped copy 

 

 

 

 

 

of the Order. 

 

 
 
o  Fax, hand deliver, or email one copy of the Order to the 
 
judgment creditor (or their attorney if they have one). 
 

 

 

 

 

 
o  Bring the Order to your bank and ask the bank to 

 
release the money in your account.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
