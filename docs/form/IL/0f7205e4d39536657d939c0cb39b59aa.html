Honorable Carolyn Taft Grosboll 
Clerk of the Supreme Court 
Supreme Comt Building 
Springfield, IL 62701-1791 

Dear Ms.  Grosboll: 

Re: Electronic Overweight Citation and Complaint Form 

The  Conference  of Chief Circuit Judges,  at  its  meeting  on  April  I 2,  2019,  approved  changes  to  the 
Electronic  Overweight  Citation  and  Complaint  Packet  (e-Overweight  Citation  Form  Packet).  The 
approved updates are part of the comprehensive systematic and procedural changes resulting from  the 
enactment of the Criminal and Traffic Assessment Act and  recent updates coordinating the A1ticle  V 
Supreme Court Rules with the Act. 

On  behalf of the  Conference  of Chief Circuit  Judges,  I hereby  submit  the  approved  e-Overweight 
Citation Form  packet to  your office for  filing  pursuant to  Supreme Court Rule 552.  The revised e 
Citation Form packet is effective July 1, 2019.  Electronically issued citations should reflect the correct 
information, provided herein,  on all  citations issued on or after July 1, 2019. 

While anyone may request a copy of the form packet, implementation of an Electronic Overweight 
Citation program is authorized in any county which has previously received approval  to  conduct 
an  electronic citation program by the Conference of Chief Circuit Judges or by the  circuit clerk. 
Law  enforcement  agencies  which  have  not  been  approved  to  conduct  an  electronic  citation 
program must continue to  use the printed Overweight Citation and Complaint Form.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
