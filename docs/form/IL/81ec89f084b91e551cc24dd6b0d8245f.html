What is a Hardship Motion? 
 
A Hardship Motion is a request to get your vehicle back 
 
temporarily after it has been taken by law enforcement. 
 
You must show that you have a “substantial hardship.” 
 
 
For example, you are unable to get to work, childcare, or 
 
the doctor without your vehicle. 
 
 
Who can file a Hardship Motion? 
o  A person whose vehicle was taken by the 
 
government during an arrest. This is called 
 
“forfeiture.” 

 

 

o  Any owner of the vehicle that has been taken can 
 
 
 
file a Hardship Motion. Usually this is the name of 
 
 
the person on the title of the vehicle. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  
Is there a deadline for filing a Hardship Motion? 
o  Yes. A Hardship Motion must be filed within 28 days 
 
 
 
after the preliminary review hearing in the forfeiture 
case. If you file after the deadline, fill out Section 5 
 
of the Hardship Motion explaining why the Motion 
  
was filed late. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Can I file a Hardship Motion before the State's 
  
Attorney has filed a Notice of Forfeiture Petition? 
 
Yes. Until the Notice of Forfeiture Petition has been filed, 
contact the State's Attorney's Office to find the case 
 
number for the property that was taken and file the 
  
Hardship Motion using that case number. 
 
 
Are there any costs to file a Hardship Motion? 
No, there are no costs to file a Hardship Motion. 
 
However, there is a fee to file an Appearance. 
o 
 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee for the 
 
Appearance, you can ask the court to file for free or 
 
at a reduced cost. Fill out the Application for Waiver 
of Court Fees to ask the court for a fee waiver. 
 
o  You can find the Appearance and Application for 
 
 
 

Waiver of Court Fees forms at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/ 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to file a Hardship 
 
Motion? 
o  Appearance: Use this form to tell the court and 
 

 

 

 
other parties that you are participating in the court 
 
case. You should file it at the same time you file your 
Hardship Motion. The email address (if you have 
one) and mailing address you put on the 
 
Appearance or Hardship Motion is where important 
legal documents will be sent to you. You should use 
an email account that you do not share with anyone

HOW TO FILE A HARDSHIP MOTION 

 

 

 

 

o  When you get your court date, ask if the court will 
 
 
 

send notice of the court date to the other parties, or 
 
if you need to. 
 
If you need to send notice, complete the Notice of 
 
Court Date for Hardship Motion found at: 
 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Step 3: Send your Appearance and Hardship Motion 
 
to all other parties. 
o  You must send your Appearance and Hardship 
 
 
 

 

 

o 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Motion to the other parties in the case. This includes 
 
the State's Attorney, the lien holder and any other 
  
person who may have a claim to the vehicle. 
If a party has a lawyer, send the Appearance and 
Hardship Motion to the lawyer. 
 
 
If you and the person you're sending the 
 
Appearance and Hardship Motion to have an email 
 
address, you must send them by email or by 
notification through the e-filing system. If you or the 
person you’re sending the Appearance and 
 
 
Hardship Motion to does not have an email address, 
 
you may give them to the other parties by personal 
 
hand delivery, mail, or third-party commercial carrier 
  
(for example, FedEx or UPS). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You must complete the Proof of Delivery section on 
 
 
 
 
the Notice of Court Date for Hardship Motion with 
information to show how you sent the forms to each 
party. The form has room for 3 parties. If you are 
sending the Notice of Hardship Motion to more than 
3 parties, fill out and add one or more Additional 
Proof of Delivery forms to the Notice of Court Date 
for Hardship Motion form. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Keep one copy of the file stamped forms for your 
 
 

 

  
own records. 

 

 

 
 
NOTE: There may be local court rules about how many 
days before the court date you have to give notice to the 
 
other party. Ask the Circuit Clerk where to find these 
 
 
rules. Look for rules about motions and notice of 
  
hearing. 
 
 
Step 4: Get ready for your court date. 
Gather and make copies of pictures and documents you 
 
want the judge to see. You will need the original for the 
judge and one copy for you and each of the people in 
 
the case. 
o 
 
 

 
If you want the judge to hear from other people, 
 
those people will have to come to court and testify 
(in most cases, you cannot bring in written 
 
statements of witnesses). Tell these people about 
 
the court date and find out if they can make it. Then 
 
write down what questions you want to ask them in 
 
front of the judge. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

o  Prepare a set of questions to ask your witnesses 
 
 

  
and the other parties' witnesses. 

 
 

o  Decide and write down: 
 
 
•  What you want to ask the judge to do for you; 
 
 

 

  
AND 

•  What you will say to the judge if asked why you 
 

What do I do after I fill out my forms? 
 
 
Step 1: File your Appearance and Hardship Motion 
 
with the Circuit Clerk in the county where the court 
 
case is filed. 
 
o  You must file the forms with the trial court by the 
 
 

 

 

 

filing deadline that applies to your case. 
 

 

 

o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
 
available 
 

 

 

 

• 
 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default.asp. 
 
•  File the original and 1 copy of your Motion, and 
 
 
the Certification, with the clerk’s office in person 
or by mail. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

provider. 
  
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: 
http://illinoiscourts.gov/CivilJustice/Resources/S 
elf-Represented_Litigants/E-
filing_Information.asp. 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your forms. 
  
•  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 
 
 

 

flash drive. 
  

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

that you can use to e-file your form. 
  

 
  
 
Step 2: Ask for a court date. 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  
date or if one will be scheduled. 
If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
 
Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
  
with other court staff.

o  Question witnesses. 
 
 
 

•  Tell the judge the name of your witnesses. 
 
  

 

 

 

•  Ask the witnesses questions 
 
 
you prepared in advance. 
  
•  The judge and the other party 
 
 
can ask questions of your 
 
witnesses when you are done. 
 
o  The judge decides whether the 
 
documents, photos, or witness 
 
testimony can be considered in 
 
making a decision about your 
 
case. 

   

     

 

 

 

   

Make sure you know how you are 
 
to attend your court date. 
Your court date could be in person, by phone 
or by video. If it is by phone or video it is 
 
called a “Remote Appearance.” Call the 
Circuit Clerk or visit their website for more 
information. To find the phone number for 
 
your Circuit Clerk, visit 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/court/CircuitCourt/CircuitCou 
rtJudges/CCC_County.asp.

 

 

 

 

 
Step 5: Go to your court date. 
 
o 
If your court date is by phone or video: 
 
 
 
•  Make sure you have the 
 
 

 

call-in or login information 
for your court date and 
make sure your 
 
technology is working. 
 
 
•  Follow the instructions on 
 

 

 

the court notice you 
 
 
received. Call the Circuit 
 
Clerk or Circuit Court or 
 
 
visit their websites for 
 
specific technology 
 
instructions. 
•  Follow these 
 

 

 

 

 
 
Step 7: The other parties present their case. 
o  The other parties will also get to present their case 
 
by testifying, giving the judge evidence, and 
questioning witnesses. 

 
o  You will get to see any documents and photos the 
 
other parties bring to court. If you do not think the 
judge should consider them in making a decision 
 
about your case, tell the judge why. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Step 8: The judge makes a decision after the parties 
 
present their case. 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 
 
 

 

 

  
called a court order. 
 
If the judge has enough information, they will fill out 
 
the Order Granting or Denying Hardship Motion. 
 
 
 
If your Hardship Motion is granted, the judge may 
 
 
limit the use of the vehicle during its temporary 
  
return to you. 
•  Get a copy of the Order that has the court stamp 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
on it. 

• 
 

 
 
If the other party was not in court to get a copy, 
you must send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the 
 
date you get the order. Fill out and file a Proof of 
 
Delivery court form with the Circuit Clerk to show 
  
that you sent the copy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If the judge needs more information to make a 
 
decision, the judge may set up another court date. 
 
Make sure you understand what information is 
  
needed and get it before the new court date. 
 
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge 
may let you know the decision later by mailing a 
 
court order. The judge might also decide at another 
 
court date.

recommendations to appear by phone or video: 
courts.illinois.gov/CivilJustice/Training_Education/ 
Remote_Hearing_FAQ_for_SRLs.pdf. 
 

o  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 

  
•  Photo I.D.; 
 
•  Copies of all the documents you filed with the 
 
 

 
Circuit Clerk; 

 

•  Your driver’s license and proof of insurance; 
 
 
•  Proof of state and city (if required by your city) 
 
 

 
 
registration; 

 

•  Copy of the blank Order Granting or Denying 
 
 
Hardship Motion; AND 
•  Other papers or proof related to your Hardship 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
Motion, including proof of ownership of the vehicle. 
o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early.  Go 
 
 
 
 
to the courtroom number listed on your court form. If 
 
your forms do not have a courtroom number, look for 
 
a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the Circuit 
 
Clerk. 

 

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

 
name and case number to be called. 

o  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 
 

 

 
introduce yourself. 

   

•  Give a copy to the judge and a copy to the other 
 
party. Be prepared to explain why the document 
 
 
or photo is important. 
•  You may be asked questions about what you 
 
 

 
say and the documents that you bring. 

 

 
Step 6: Tell the judge your side of the case and 
 
answer questions. 
o  Show evidence including documents and photos.
