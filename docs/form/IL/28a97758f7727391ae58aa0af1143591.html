Rule 11. Manner of Serving Documents Other Than Process and Complaint on Parties Not 
in Default in the Trial and Reviewing Courts 

(a)  On Whom Made. If a party is represented by an attorney ofrecord, service shall be made 

upon the attorney. Otherwise service shall be made upon the party. 

(b) E-mail Address. An attorney must include on the appearance and on all pleadings filed in 
court an e-mail address to which documents and notices will be served in conformance with Rule 
131 ( d).  A  self-represented litigant who has an e-mail address must also include the e-mail address 
on the appearance and on all pleadings filed in court to which documents and notices will be served 
in conformance with Rule  131 ( d). 
(c)  Method.  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  rule  or  order  of court,  documents  shall  be  served 
electronically. 

( l) Electronic service may be made 

(i) through an approved electronic filing service provider (EFSP) or 

(ii) to the e-mail address(es) identified by the party's appearance in the matter. 

If service is made by e-mail, the documents may be transmitted via attachment or by providing 
a link within the body of the e-mail that will allow the party to download the document. 

(2)  If a  self-represented  party  does  not  have  an  e-mail  address,  or  if service  other than 
electronic  service  is  specified  by  rule  or  order  of court,  or  if extraordinary  circumstances 
prevent timely electronic service in a particular instance, service of documents may be made 
by one of the following alternative methods: 

(i)  Personal Service.  Delivering  the document to the attorney or party personally; 
(ii) Delivery to  Attorney's Office or  Self-Represented Party's Residence.  Delivery of 
the document to an authorized person at the attorney's office or in a reasonable receptacle 
or location at  or within the  attorney's office.  If a party is  not represented by counsel, by 
leaving the document at the party's residence with a family member of the age of 13  years 
or older; 

(iii)United States Mail.  Depositing the document in a United States post office or post 
office  box,  enclosed  in  an  envelope  to  the  party's  address,  as  identified  by  the  party's 
appearance in the matter, with postage fully prepaid; or 

(iv) Third-Party Commercial Carrier.  Delivery of the document through  a third-party 
commercial carrier or courier, to the party's address, as identified by the party's appearance 
in the matter, with delivery charge fully prepaid. 

( d.)  Multiple  Parties  or  Attorneys. In  cases  in  which  there  are  two  or  more  plaintiffs  or 
defendants  who  appear  by  different  attorneys,  service  of all  documents  shall  be  made  on  the 
attorney  for  each of the parties.  When more than  one  attorney appears  for  a  party,  service upon 
one of them is  sufficient. 

(e)  Notice of E-mail Rejection. If a party serving a document via e-mail receives a rejection 
message or similar notification suggesting that transmission was not successful, the party serving 
the  document  shall  make  a  good-faith  effort  to  alert  the  intended  recipient  of  a  potential 
transmission problem and take reasonable steps to ensure actual service of the document. 

(f)  Limited Scope Appearance. After an attorney files a Notice of Limited Scope Appearance 

in accordance with Rule  13( c )( 6), service of all documents shall be made on both the attorney and 
the  party  represented  on  a  limited  scope  basis  until:  (1)  the  court  enters  an  order  allowing  the 
attorney to withdraw under Rule 13( c) or (2) the attorney's representation automatically terminates 
under Rule 13( c )(7)(ii).

Committee Comment 
(July  15, 2020) 

When  a  self-represented  litigant  has  provided  an  e-mail  address  to  the  court  pursuant  to 
subparagraph  (b ),  courts  retain  discretion  to  determine  if an  alternative  method  of service  of 
documents or notices, either in addition to or instead of e-mail, is needed. 

(December 9,  2015) 

In amending Rule  11  to provide for e-mail service, the Committee considered whether special 
additional  rules  should  apply  to  documents  served  by  e-mail,  e.g.,  specified  file  formats,  scan 
resolutions, electronic file size limitations, etc. The Committee rejected such requirements in favor 
of an approach which provides flexibility to adapt to evolving technology and developing practice. 
The  Committee  further  anticipates  good  faith  cooperation  by  practitioners.  For  example,  if an 
attorney serves a motion in a fonnat which cannot be read by the recipient, the Committee expects 
the recipient to contact the sender to request an alternative electronic format or a paper copy. 

New  subparagraphs  (b)(6)  and  (7)  were  created  to  allow  for  service  of  documents 
electronically. The amendments facilitate electronic communications among the court, parties, and 
counsel and complement the expansion of e-filing in the trial courts. However, electronic service 
may not be appropriate in all instances. For example, absent a secure method for electronic service 
of documents, other service options should be used for cases or documents filed confidentially. 

The rules on service and filing have been revised to provide for sending documents via third 
party commercial carrier. Under these rules, the tenn "delivery" refers to  all the carrier's standard

Committee Comments 
(December 29, 2009) 

The rules  on service and filing  have been revised to provide for sending documents via third 
party  commercial  carrier.  Under  these  rules,  the  term  "delivery"  refers  to  all  the  carrier's 
standard pick-up methods,  such as  dropping a package in a UPS  or FedEx box or with a UPS  or 
FedEx contractor.

Rule 315. Leave to Appeal From the Appellate Court to  the Supreme Court 

(a)  Petition for  Leave to  Appeal;  Grounds. Except as provided below for  appeals from  the 
Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission division of the Appellate Court, a petition for leave 
to  appeal to the Supreme Court from the Appellate Court may be filed by any party, including the 
State,  in  any case not appealable  from  the  Appellate  Court as  a matter of right.  Whether such  a 
petition  will  be  granted  is  a  matter  of sound judicial  discretion.  The  following,  while  neither 
controlling nor fully measuring the court's discretion, indicate the character ofreasons which will 
be considered: the general importance of the question presented; the existence of a conflict between 
the decision sought to  be reviewed and a decision of the Supreme Court, or of another division of 
the Appellate Court;  the need for  the  exercise of the  Supreme Court's supervisory authority;  and 
the final or interlocutory character of the judgment sought to be reviewed. 

No petition for leave to appeal from a judgment of the five-judge panel of the Appellate Court 
designated  to  hear  and  decide  cases  involving  review  of  Illinois  Workers'  Compensation 
Commission orders shall be filed, unless two or more judges of that panel join in a statement that 
the case in question involves a substantial question which warrants consideration by the Supreme 
Court. A motion asking that such a statement be filed may be filed as a prayer for alternative relief 
in  a petition for  rehearing,  but must,  in  any  event,  be filed  within  the  time  allowed  for  filing  a 
petition for rehearing. 

(b) Time. 

(l) Published  Decisions.  Unless  a  timely  petition  for  rehearing  is  filed  in  the  Appellate 
Court,  a party  seeking  leave to  appeal  must file  the  petition  for  leave  in  the  Supreme Court 
within 35  days after the entry of such judgment. If a timely petition for rehearing is  filed,  the 
party seeking review must file the petition for leave to appeal within 35 days after the entry of 
the order denying the petition for rehearing or,  if a modified decision is issued upon denial of 
rehearing, from the entry of the modified decision.  If a petition is granted, the petition for leave 
to appeal must be filed within 35 days of the entry of the judgment on rehearing. The Supreme 
Court, or a judge thereof, on motion, may extend the time for petitioning for  leave to  appeal, 
but such motions are not favored and will be allowed only in the most extreme and compelling 
circumstances. The filing of a corrected opinion by the Appellate Court where no petition for 
rehearing was filed does not extend the time for a party to  file  a petition for leave to  appeal. 

(2)  Rule 23  Orders. The time for filing a petition for leave to appeal a Rule 23  order shall 
be the  same as  for published opinions unless a timely motion to publish has been filed in the 
Appellate  Court pursuant to  Rule 23(f).  If the Appellate  Court grants  the  motion  to  publish, 
the party seeking review must file the petition for leave to appeal within 35  days after the filing 
of the opinion.  If the Appellate Court denies  the motion to  publish, the party seeking review 
must file  the petition for  leave to  appeal within  35  days  after entry  of the  order denying the 
motion  to  publish.  The  filing  of  a  Rule  23(f)  publication  motion  shall  not  invalidate  a 
previously filed  petition for  leave to  appeal.  The clerk of the  Appellate Court shall promptly 
transmit notice of the filing of a Rule 23(f) publication motion and its disposition to the  clerk 
of the  Supreme Court in any case in which a petition for  leave to  appeal is  filed,  irrespective 
of whether the motion to publish precedes or follows the filing of a petition for leave to appeal. 
(c)  Contents. The petition for leave to  appeal shall contain, in the following order: 

(1)  a prayer for leave to  appeal; 

(2)  a  statement of the  date  upon which the judgment was  entered;  whether a petition  for 
rehearing was filed and, if so, the date of the denial of the petition or the date of the judgment 
on rehearing; 

(3)  a  statement  of the  points  relied  upon  in  asking  the  Supreme  Court  to  review  the 

judgment of the Appellate Court; 

( 4)  a fair and accurate statement of the facts,  which shall contain the facts necessary to an 
understanding of the  case,  without argument or comment, with appropriate references to  the 
pages of the record on appeal, in the format as  set forth in the Standards and Requirements for 
Electronic Filing the Record on Appeal. 

( 5)  a short argument (including appropriate authorities) stating why review by the Supreme 
Court is warranted and why the decision of the Appellate Court should be reversed or modified; 
and 

( 6)  an  appendix which  shall  include the  opinion or order of the  Appellate  Court and  any 

documents from the record which are deemed necessary to the consideration of the petition. 
(d)  Format;  Service;  Filing. The  petition  shall  otherwise  be  prepared,  served,  and  filed  in 
accordance with the requirements  for  briefs as  set forth  in Rules  341  through 343,  except that it 
shall  be  limited  to  20  pages  or,  alternatively,  6,000  words,  excluding  any  items  identified  as 
excluded from the length limitation in Rule 341 (b )( l ). 

(e)  Records. The clerk of the Supreme Court shall transmit notice of the filing of the petition 
to  the  clerk of the  Appellate  Court,  who,  upon request of the  clerk of the  Supreme  Court made 
either before or after the petition is  acted upon,  shall transmit to  the clerk of the  Supreme Court 
the record on appeal that was filed in the Appellate Court and the certified Appellate Court record. 
(t)  Answer. The  respondent  need  not  but  may  file  an  answer,  with  proof  of  service, 
within 21  days  after the expiration of the time for the filing of the petition, or within such further 
time as the Supreme Court or a judge thereof may grant. An answer shall set forth reasons why the 
petition should not be granted, and shall conform, to  the extent appropriate, to  the form  specified 
in this  rnle for the petition,  omitting the  items (1),  (2),  (3),  (4) and (6)  set forth  in paragraph (c) 
except to  the  extent  that correction of the  petition is  considered necessary.  The answer  shall  be 
prepared,  served,  and  filed  in  accordance with the  requirements  for briefs  except that it shall be 
limited to 20 pages or, alternatively, 6,000 words, excluding any items identified as excluded from 
the  length  limitation in  Rule  341(b)(l).  No  reply to  the  answer  shall  be  filed.  If the  respondent 
does not file an answer or otherwise appear but wants notice of the disposition of the petition for 
leave to appeal, a request for such notice should be submitted to the clerk in Springfield. 

(g)  Transmittal of Trial Court Record if Petition Is Granted. If the petition is granted, upon 
notice from  the  clerk of the Supreme Court the clerk of the Appellate Court shall transmit to  the 
Supreme Court the record on appeal that was filed in the Appellate Court and the Appellate Court 
record, unless already filed in the Supreme Court. 

(h) Briefs Other Than in Child Custody and Delinquent Minor Cases. Ifleave to appeal is 
allowed,  the  appellant  may allow his  or her petition for  leave  to  appeal  to  stand as  the  brief of 
appellant, or may file a brief. Within 14 days after the date on which leave to appeal was allowed, 

-2-

appellant shall serve on all counsel of record a notice of election to allow the petition for leave to 
appeal to  stand as  the  brief of appellant,  or to  file  an  additional brief,  and within the  same time 
shall  file  the notice with the  clerk of the  Supreme Court.  If appellant elects to  allow the petition 
for leave to  appeal to stand as  his or her brief, appellant shall file with the notice a complete table 
of contents, with page references, of the record on appeal and a statement of the applicable standard 
ofreview for each issue, with citation to authority, in accordance with Rule 341 (h)(3 ). If appellant 
elects  to  file  an additional brief,  it shall be filed  within 35  days  from  the  date on which leave to 
appeal was allowed.  Motions to  extend the time for filing an additional brief are not favored  and 
will be allowed only in the most extreme and compelling circumstances. 

The appellee may allow his or her answer to the petition for leave to appeal to stand as the brief 
of appellee, or may file a brief. If the appellant has elected to allow the petition for leave to appeal 
to stand as the brief of appellant, within 14 days after the due date of appellant's notice the appellee 
shall  serve  on  all  counsel  of record  a  notice  of election  to  let  the  answer  stand  as  the  brief of 
appellee,  or to  file  a  brief,  and  within  the  same  time  shall  file  the  notice  with  the  clerk of the 
Supreme Court.  If the appellee elects to file a brief,  such brief shall be filed within 35  days of the 
due date of appellant's notice of election to let the petition for leave to appeal stand as  the brief of 
appellant. 

If the  appellant  has  elected  to  file  an  additional  brief,  within  14  days  after  the  due  date  of 
appellant's brief the appellee shall  serve on  all counsel of record a notice of election to let his  or 
her answer stand as  the brief of appellee,  or to  file  an additional brief,  and within the same time 
shall  file  a  copy of the  notice  with  the  clerk  of the  Supreme Court.  If appellee  elects  to  file  an 
additional brief it shall be filed within 35 days of the due date of appellant's brief. 

If an appellee files  a brief and that brief does not contain arguments in support of cross-relief, 
the appellant may file  a reply brief within  14  days of the due date of appellee's brief.  If the brief 
of appellee contains arguments in support of cross-relief, the appellant may file  a combined reply 
brief and  response  to  the  appellee's  request  for  cross-relief within  35  days  of the  due  date  of 
appellee's  brief,  and  the  appellee  may  file  a  reply  brief  confined  strictly  to  the  appellant's 
arguments in opposition to the appellee's request for cross-relief within 14 days of the due date of 
appellant's  combined brief.  If the  brief of the  appellee  contains  arguments  in  support  of cross 
relief,  the  cover  of the  appellee's  brief  shall  be  captioned:  "Brief  of Appellee.  Cross-Relief 
Requested,"  the  cover  of the  appellant's  combined  reply  brief and  response  to  the  appellee's 
request for  cross-relief shall be captioned "Appellant's Reply Brief and Response to  Request for 
Cross-Relief," and the cover of the appellee's reply in support of its request for cross-relief shall 
be captioned "Appellee's Reply in Support of Request for Cross-Relief." 

Briefs, pleadings and other documents filed with the Supreme Court in cases covered by this 
rule  shall,  to  the  extent appropriate,  conform to  Rules  341  through  343.  If the  brief of appellee 
contains arguments in support of cross-relief, then the  length limitations for cross-appeals in Rule 
341 (b )( l) shall apply to the briefing in the case. 

In  cases  involving  more  than  one  appellant  or  appellee,  including  cases  consolidated  for 
purposes  of the  appeal,  any  number  of either  may join in  a  single  brief,  and  any  appellant  or 
appellee may adopt by reference any part of the brief of another. Parties may similarly join in reply

Rule 317. Appeals from the Appellate Court to  the Supreme Court as of Right 

Appeals from the Appellate Court shall lie to the Supreme Court as  a matter of right in cases 
in which a statute of the United States or of this state has been held invalid or in which a question 
under the Constitution of the United States or of this state arises for the first time in and as  a result 
of the  action of the Appellate Court.  The appeal  shall be initiated by filing  a petition in the form 
prescribed by Rule 315, except that the petition shall be entitled "Petition for Appeal as  a Matter 
of Right." Item (1) of the petition shall state that the appeal is  taken as  a matter of right and item 
(5) shall contain argument as to why appeal to the Supreme Court lies as a matter ofright. In other 
respects the procedure is governed by Rule 315. If leave to appeal is to be sought in the alternative, 
the  request therefor must be  included in the  same petition,  and item  (1)  thereof shall  include  an 
alternative prayer for leave to appeal, and item (5) the argument as  to why in the alternative leave 
to appeal should be allowed as a matter of sound judicial discretion. When both appeal as  a matter 
of right and  leave to appeal  are  sought,  both requests will be disposed of by a single order.  If the 
court allows the petition, briefs shall be filed as provided in the case of appeal by leave under Rule 
315.

Committee Comments 
(Revised 1979) 

This rule provides, in the language of the Constitution ( art.  VI,  §4 ( c) ),  for appeals as  of right 
from the Appellate Court in cases in which '' a question under the Constitution of the United States 
or of this State arises for the first time in and as  a result of the action of the Appellate Court." The 
procedure in such cases will be similar to that provided in Rule 315 for petitions for leave to appeal, 
except that the petition need only contain argument as  to  why appeal lies to the Supreme Court as 
a matter of right.  Prior to  the  adoption of this  rule  effective  January  1,  1967,  such  appeals  were 
taken by notice of appeal. (See former Rule 32(3).) The experience of the Supreme Court was that 
this  procedure was  often  invoked improperly,  a fact which the  court would not usually discover 
until full briefs on the merits were filed and the case was scheduled for oral argument. The time of 
counsel and of the court is saved by giving the court an opportunity to  determine this preliminary 
question on the basis of a petition filed in advance. 

The rule was amended in June 1970 (a) to make mandatory the provision that ifleave to appeal 
is to be sought in the alternative to appeal as of right, the requests for both alternatives are to appear 
in the same petition, and (b) to provide expressly that if there are requests for both an appeal as  of 
right and an appeal by leave, the court will dispose of both requests in a single order. 

In  1979, Rule 342 was amended to provide that, with the exception of stated documents (see 

Rule 342(a)), no portions of the record shall be reproduced, and that, absent an order of the 
reviewing court, no abstract shall be prepared and filed.  The last sentence of Rule 317 was 
amended to reflect this change in the practice. See the committee comments to Rule 342.

official original. A court of review may, in its electronic filing procedures, require duplicate paper 
copies bearing the court's electronic file stamp. Such copies shall be printed one-sided and securely 
bound on the left side in a manner that does not obstruct the text.  Such copies shall be received by 
the  clerk  within  five  days  of  the  electronic  notification  generated  upon  acceptance  of  an 
electronically filed document. 

The brief shall be served upon each other party to the appeal represented by separate counsel. 

Proof of service shall be filed with all briefs. 

(t)  References to Parties. In the brief the parties shall be referred to as  in the trial court, e.g., 
plaintiff and defendant, omitting the words appellant and appellee and petitioner and respondent, 
or by using actual names or descriptive terms such as  "the employee," "the injured person," "the 
taxpayer," "the railroad," etc. 

In all appeals  involving juveniles filed  from proceedings under the  Juvenile Court Act or the 
Adoption Act,  and in  all  appeals under the Mental  Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, 
the  Mental  Health  and  Developmental  Disabilities  Confidentiality  Act,  or  from  actions  for 
collection of fees  for mental health services, the respective juvenile or recipient of mental-health 
services shall be identified by first name and last initial or by initials only. 

The preferred method is  the first name and last initial.  The alternative method of initials only 
is  to be used when, due to an unusual first name or spelling, the preferred method would create a 
substantial  risk  of revealing  the  individual's  identity.  The  name  of the  involved  juvenile  or 
recipient of services shall not appear in the brief. 

(g)  Citations. Citations shall be made as provided in Rule 6. 
(h) Appellant's  Brief.  The  appellant's  brief shall  contain  the  following  parts  in  the  order 

named: 

(1)  A  table of contents, including a summary statement, entitled "Points and Authorities," 
of the points argued and the authorities cited in the Argument. This shall consist of the headings 
of the points  and subpoints  as  in  the  Argument,  with the  citation under  each heading of the 
authorities relied upon or distinguished, and a reference to the page of the brief on which each 
heading and each authority appear. 

(2)  An  introductory  paragraph  stating  (i)  the  nature  of the  action  and  of the  judgment 
appealed from and whether the judgment is based upon the verdict of a jury, and (ii) whether 
any question is raised on the pleadings and, if so, the nature of the question. 

Illustration: 

-2-

"This action was brought to recover damages occasioned by the  alleged negligence of 
the defendant in driving his automobile. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff upon 
which the  court entered  the judgment from  which this  appeal  is  taken.  No  questions  are 
raised on the pleadings." 

(3)  A  statement  of the  issue  or issues  presented for  review,  without  detail  or  citation  of 

authorities. 

Illustration: 
Issue Presented for Review: 
"Whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law." 

[or] 
"Whether the trial court ruled correctly on certain objections to evidence." 

"Whether the jury was improperly instructed." 

[or] 

The appellant must include a concise statement of the applicable standard of review for each 
issue,  with citation to  authority,  either in the  discussion of the  issue  in the  argument or under  a 
separate heading placed before the discussion in the argument. 

( 4) A statement of jurisdiction: 

(i)  In a case appealed to the Supreme Court directly from the trial court or as a matter 
of right from the Appellate Court, a brief statement under the heading "Jurisdiction" of the 
jurisdictional grounds for the appeal to the Supreme Court. 

(ii) In  a  case  appealed  to  the  Appellate  Court,  a  brief,  but  precise  statement  or 
explanation under the heading "Jurisdiction" of the basis for appeal including the supreme 
court rule or other law which confers jurisdiction upon the reviewing court; the facts of the 
case which bring it within this rule or other law; and the date that the order being appealed 
was  entered  and  any  other  facts  which  are  necessary  to  demonstrate  that  the  appeal  is 
timely.  In  appeals  from  a judgment as  to  all  the  claims  and all  the parties,  the  statement 
shall  demonstrate  the  disposition  of all  claims  and  all  parties.  All  facts  recited  in  this 
statement shall be supported by page references to the record on appeal. 

( 5)  In  a  case involving  the  construction or validity of a  statute,  constitutional  provision, 
treaty, ordinance, or regulation, the pertinent parts of the provision verbatim, with a citation of 
the place where it may be found, all under an appropriate heading, such as "Statutes Involved." 
If the provision involved is lengthy, its citation alone will suffice at this point, and its pertinent 
text shall be set forth in an appendix. 

(6)  Statement of Facts, which shall contain the facts necessary to an understanding of the 
case, stated accurately and fairly without argument or comment, and with appropriate reference 

-3-

to the pages of the record on appeal in the format as set forth in the Standards and Requirements 
for Electronic Filing the Record on Appeal. 

(7)  Argument, which shall contain the contentions of the appellant and the reasons therefor, 
with  citation  of the  authorities  and the  pages  of the  record  relied  on.  Evidence  shall  not  be 
copied  at  length,  but  reference  shall  be  made  to  the  pages  of the  record  on  appeal  where 
evidence may be found.  Citation of numerous  authorities  in support of the  same point is  not 
favored.  Points  not  argued  are  forfeited  and  shall  not  be  raised  in  the  reply  brief,  in  oral 
argument, or on petition for rehearing. 

(8)  A short conclusion stating the precise relief sought, followed by the names of counsel 

as on the cover. 

(9)  An appendix as required by Rule 342. 

(i)  Briefs  of Appellee  and  Other Parties.  The brief for the  appellee  and other parties shall 
confonn to the foregoing requirements, except that items (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (9) of paragraph 
(h)  of this rule need not be included except to  the  extent that the presentation by the  appellant is 
deemed unsatisfactory. 

(j)  Reply  Brief.  The reply brief,  if any,  shall  be  confined  strictly  to  replying  to  arguments 

presented in the brief of the appellee and need contain only Argument. 

(k)  Supplemental Brief on Leave to Appeal.  A party allowing a petition for leave to appeal 
or for appeal as  a matter of right or an answer thereto to stand as  his or her main brief, may file  a 
supplemental brief,  so  entitled,  containing additional  material,  and  omitting any of the  items  set 
forth  in paragraph (h)  of this rule to the extent that they are  adequately covered in the petition or 
answer.  The Points and Authorities  in the  supplemental brief need relate  only to  the  contents  of 
that brief.

Committee Comments 
(revised Sept.  15, 2017) 

This  rule  was  based  upon  former  Supreme  Court  Rule  39,  effective  until  January  1,  1967, 
which in turn was based upon former Uniform (and later Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth District) 
-4-

Appellate Court Rule 7.  There were no major changes. 

Paragraph (a) 

This paragraph deals with the length of briefs and the use of footnotes.  It is  derived from  the 
second, third, and fourth sentences of former Rule 39( 1 ). Three printed pages will normally contain 
approximately as  many words as  four unprinted pages, so  the length  limitations are  substantially 
the same for printed and unprinted briefs. 

The provision that footnotes  are to  be in the same size type as  required for the text of the brief 
was deleted.  Footnotes are to be used sparingly. Rule 344(b) prescribes  10-point type on  11-point 
slugs, instead of the  11-point type used in the body. This use of smaller type is conventional in the 
printing of legal texts,  law reviews,  the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States,  and 
other comparable materials. It is believed that the limited use of this slightly smaller type will not 
impose a burden on the courts. 

In  1984 subsection (a) was amended to  reduce from 75  to  50 the number of pages allowed to 
be  in  a  printed  brief and  from  100  to  75  the  number  allowed  in  a  brief that  is  not printed,  and 
excludes from that page limitation those matters which are required by Rule 342(a) to be appended 
thereto. 

This  is  a revision  of former  Rule  40(1).  The  alternative  word limitation for  determining  the 

maximum length of briefs is based on a uniform assumption of 300 words per page. 

This paragraph is  derived in part from  the  first  sentence of former Rule  39(1 ),  except that it 
recognizes certain existing practices not pennitted by the former rule if it  was read literally.  One 
is the use of the designations "appellant" and "appellee," together with the designation of the party 
in the trial court, in the title of the case appearing in the caption. The other is  that the parties may 
be  referred to by actual names or descriptive terms  instead of as  plaintiff or defendant, which in 
many instances is desirable to avoid confusion. 

The  paragraph  was  amended  effective  October  1,  2001,  to  help  protect  the  identities  of 
recipients  of mental health  services.  The  amendment requires  that only their first  name and  last 
initial,  or their  initials,  appear  on  documents  filed  with  the  Appellate  Court  or  any  subsequent 
court.  The  requirement  covers  the  parties'  briefs,  motions,  and  other  similar  papers.  The 
amendment does  not require  deletion  of names  from  the  trial  record  in  preparing  the  record  on 
appeal, nor does it address the means by which the Appellate Court or a subsequent court maintains 
the confidentiality of documents appearing in the record. 

Paragraph (b) 

Paragraph (c) 

Paragraph ( d) 
-5-

Effective  January  20,  1993,  the  requirements  applicable  to  citations  to  cases,  textbooks  and 
statutes were placed in Rule 6, which is applicable to all documents filed in court, including briefs. 

Paragraph (e) 

Paragraph (e) is a substantial revision of portions of former Rule 39. 
In  1981  the subparagraphs were restructured to make "Points and Authorities" the first part of 

the brief, so that it might act as  a table of contents. 

Subparagraph  (1)  is  based  upon  the  first  three  sentences  of the  paragraph  designated  II  of 
former  Rule  39( 1 ).  The  revised  provision  specifically  relates  the  Points  and  Authorities  to  the 
Argument.  The  same  headings  of the  points  and  subpoints  are  to  be  used  both  here  and  in  the 
Argument. The fom1er provision that the three cases most relied on shall be cited first under each 
point was  deleted in favor  of the  last  sentence  of subparagraph  ( e ),  which  provides  for  ranking 
cases "as near as  may be in the order of their importance." 

The "introductory paragraph" provided for in subparagraph (2) will ordinarily not be captioned 
as  such  in the  brief.  As  the  illustration  shows,  the  introductory paragraph  is  for  the  purpose  of 
informing the court of the general area of the law in which the case falls, whether there was a jury 
trial,  and whether there is  a pleading question and if so what it is.  The practice of many lawyers 
was to include in the  statement of "The Nature of the Action" called for by the fonner rule much 
more detail than the courts wanted at this place in the brief. 

The  fom1er  requirement  that  "The  Nature  of the  Case"  include  a  statement  of the  party's 

"theory of the case" also produced much more detail than the rule contemplated. 

Subparagraph (3)  substitutes  for  the  "theory of the  case"  a  statement of "the issue  or issues 
presented  for  review."  Again,  the  court  does  not  want  detail  at  this  point  in  the  brief,  as  the 
illustration  in the  rule  following  this  subparagraph attempts  to  make  clear.  The  statement of the 
issue presented for review is  not to be an elaborately framed legal question.  Its purpose is to  give 
the court a general idea of what the case is about. The court is not ready at this stage to  appreciate 
the details.  It should be noticed, for example, that the first alternative illustration of a statement of 
the issue presented for review does not state what conduct it is that one of the parties contends is 
contributory negligence as a matter oflaw. The second alternative does not describe the objections 
or the evidence to which they relate. The third alternative does not describe the instruction of which 
the complaint is made. 

Subparagraph ( 4) is in part based upon former Rule 28-1, B. A similar provision appears in the 
rules  of the  Supreme Court of the United States. (Rule 40,  l(b).) In  cases appealed to the Illinois 
Supreme Court as  of right, it is  important that the court be satisfied at the outset that jurisdiction 
exists.  (See the comments to Rule 302.) 

Subparagraph (4)(ii) was expanded effective February 1,  1994, to provide more comprehensive 
examples  of what must be included in the  statement demonstrating jurisdiction in the Appellate 
Court. 

Subparagraph ( 5) is a combination of the third paragraph of former Rule 3 9( 1) and paragraph 

-6-

1 ( c) of Rule 40 of the rules of the Supreme Court of the United States. 

Subparagraph  (6)  was  based  upon  the  paragraph  numbered  III  of former  Rule  39(1).  The 
provision with respect to  the citation of exhibits was new,  as  were the illustrations as to  the form 
of the  citations  to  the  record.  This  subparagraph was  amended in  1979 to  delete  reference to  the 
preparation  of excerpts  from  record  to  reflect  the  amendment  of Rule  342  to  eliminate  the 
preparation and duplication of excerpts from the record except for the inclusion of copies of stated 
documents as  an  appendix to the brief,  and to  eliminate the preparation and filing  of an  abstract 
except on order of the reviewing court. (See Rule 342(a).) Because the elimination of excerpts and 
an abstract in most cases lends added importance to the accuracy and fairness with which the facts 
are stated in the brief, the first sentence of the subparagraph was amended to emphasize this point. 
A similar amendment was made to Rule 315(b)(4).  See the committee comments to Rule 342. 

Subparagraph  (7)  is  a  revision  of the  paragraph  numbered  IV  of former  Rule  39(1 ).  The 
description of what the Argument is to contain is somewhat amplified. The provision admonishing 
against citation of numerous authorities was new.  The limitation of the Argument to  points made 
and  cases  cited  in  the  Points  and  Authorities  is  no  longer  appropriate,  since  the  Points  and 
Authorities is  to be derived from  the Argument.  The former provision that a point "made but not 
argued may be considered waived" was changed to  the affirmative statement of the last sentence 
of the paragraph that failure  to  argue results  in waiver and,  further,  that a point that has not been 
argued shall not be raised subsequently. 

Subparagraph (8), requiring a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought, was new.  It is 
customary  to  include  a  conclusion  in  a  brief,  but  the  relief sought  is  not  always  stated  in  the 
conclusion.  This  provision requires  the  party to  end his  brief by telling the  court what relief he 
wants. 

Paragraph (t) 

The predecessor of this paragraph is  the second paragraph following the paragraph numbered 
IV in fonner Rule 39( 1 ).  The new provision is simplified. The requirement that the appellee's brief 
state the propositions relied upon to  sustain the judgment "as far as practicable, in the  same order 
as  the points of appellant" was not brought forward into the present rule.  When the nature of the 
subject matter pem1its,  counsel will nonnally follow  the order established by his  opponent in the 
interest  of making  his  brief as  convenient  as  possible  for  the  court  to  use.  Sometimes  effective 
advocacy  requires  that  a  different  order  be  adopted.  In  the  opinion  of the  committee  it  is  not 
possible to regulate this matter by rule. 

Paragraph (g) is the last paragraph of former Rule 3 9(1 ),  without change of substance. 

Paragraph (g) 

Paragraph (h) 

-7-

Paragraph  (h)  as  it  appeared  in  the  revised  rules  effective  January  1,  1967,  was  deleted  in 

October 1969, as unnecessary in light of paragraph (b) of Rule 343, adopted at that time. 

What is now paragraph (h) was paragraph (i) of the revision adopted effective January 1, 1967, 
and was new at that time, although it provides specifically for a practice that was often employed 
under the fonner rules.  This paragraph makes clear the extent to  which the requirements of Rule 
341  apply to a supplemental brief filed in supplement of, rather than in lieu of, a petition for leave 
to appeal or an answer that party has allowed to stand as his main brief.

Rule 361. Motions in Reviewing Court 

(a)  Content  of  Motions;  Supporting  Record;  Other  Supporting  Documents. Unless 
another fonn is elsewhere prescribed by these rules, an application for an order or other relief shall 
be made by filing  a motion.  Motions  shall be  in writing and shall state the relief sought and the 
grounds  therefor.  If the  record  has  not  been  filed  the  movant  shall  file  with  the  motion  an 
appropriate supporting record (Rule 328). When the motion is based on facts  that do not appear of 
record it shall be supported by affidavit or verification by  certification pursuant to section 1-109 
of the Code of Civil Procedure. Any affidavit shall be sworn to before a person who has authority 
under  the  law  to  administer  oaths.  Argument  not  contained  in  the  motion  may  be  made  in  a 
supporting memorandum. 

If counsel has conferred with opposing counsel and opposing counsel has no  objection to  the 
motion, that fact should be stated in the motion in order to allow the court to rule upon the motion 
without waiting until the time for filing responses has expired. 

(b) Filing; Proposed Order; Responses. The motion shall be served, presented, and filed as 

follows: 

(1)  The motion,  together with proof of service,  shall be filed  with the  clerk.  See Rule  11 
regarding manner of serving documents  and Rule  12  regarding proof of service.  Service and 
filing will be excused only in case of necessity. 

(2)  A  proposed  order  phrased  in  the  alternative  (e.g.,  "Allowed"  or  "Denied")  shall  be 
submitted with each motion and shall be served upon all counsel of record. No motion shall be 
accepted by the clerk unless accompanied by such a proposed order. 

(3)  Responses to  a motion shall be in writing and be filed,  with proof of service, within 5 
days  after personal  or e-mail service of the motion,  or  10  days  after mailing of the  motion if 
service is by mail, or 10 days after delivery to a third-paiiy commercial can-ier if service is by 
delivery to a third-party commercial can-ier, or within such further time as the court or a judge 
thereof may allow.  Except by order of court, replies to  responses will not be allowed and oral 
arguments on motions will not be heard. 
(c)  Additional Requirement in  Supreme Court. 

( l) If a  rule  provides  that relief may  be  granted  "by  the  court  or  a justice  thereof,"  the 
motion shall be directed to only one justice.  The clerk shall direct the motion to the justice of 
the judicial district involved or, in Cook County, to the justice designated to hear motions. The 
response to a motion shall also be directed to the justice within the time provided in paragraph 
(b)(3). 

(2)  If the  motion  seeks  relief that under these  rules  requires  action by the  full  court,  the 
movant shall file the motion in accordance with paragraph (b )(1 ).  Responses to a motion shall 
be filed with the clerk within the time provided in paragraph (b )(3) or, if applicable, within the 
time provided in Rule 381  or 383. 
(d)  When  Acted  Upon. Except  in  extraordinary  circumstances,  or where  opposing  counsel 
has  indicated no  objections, no  motion will be  acted upon until the  time  for  filing  responses  has 
expired. 

(e)  Corrections. The  clerk is  authorized to  make  con-ections  in  any  document of a party to 

any pending case upon receipt of written request from that party together with proof that a copy of 
the request has been transmitted to all other parties. 

(f)  Motions for Extensions of Time. Motions for extensions of time shall be filed on or before 
the due date of the document the party is seeking an extension of time to file and shall be supported 
by affidavit or verification by certification under section 1-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 
counsel or the party showing the number of previous extensions granted and the reason for each 
extension.  Any  affidavit  shall  be  sworn to  before  a  person  who  has  authority  under  the  law  to 
administer oaths. 

(g)  Emergency  Motions  and  Bail  Motions. Each  District  of  the  Appellate  Court  shall 
promulgate and publish rules setting forth the procedure for emergency motions, including notice 
requirements.  Subject to  the rules of each District,  an emergency motion must specify the nature 
of the emergency and the grounds for the specific relief requested.  Except in the most extreme and 
compelling circumstances, a motion for an extension of time will not be considered an emergency. 
Motions regarding bail in criminal cases  or bonds  in civil and criminal cases  shall be  considered 
emergency motions if so designated by the movant. 

(h) Dispositive Motions. 

( 1)  Dispositive  motions  in  the  Appellate  Court  should be ruled  upon promptly  after  the 
filing  of the  objection to the motion,  if any.  A dispositive motion may be taken with the  case 
where the  court cannot resolve the  motion without consideration of the  full record on appeal 
and full briefing of the merits. 

(2)  For purposes of this Rule 36l(h), "dispositive motion" means any motion challenging 
the  Appellate  Court's jurisdiction or raising any other issue that could result in the dismissal 
of any portion of an appeal or cross appeal without a decision on the merits of that portion of 
the appeal or cross-appeal. 

(3)  A dispositive motion shall include: 

consider the dispositive motion; 

(a)  a  discussion  of the  facts  and  issues  on  appeal  sufficient  to  enable  the  court  to 

(b)  a discussion  of the  facts  and  law supporting the  dismissal  of the  appeal  or cross 

appeal or portion thereof prior to  a determination of the appeal on the merits; 

( c)  a discussion of the relationship, if any, of the purported dispositive issue to the other 

issues on appeal; 

( d)  an appropriate supporting record containing (i)  if the record on appeal has not yet 
been filed,  the  parts of the trial court record necessary to  support the dispositive motion; 
and  (ii)  if necessary,  any  evidence  of relevant  matters  not  of record  in  accordance with 
Rule 361(a). 

(4)  An objection to a dispositive motion shall address each of the required portions of the 
motion,  and if the  record on appeal has not yet been filed,  shall include any parts  of the  trial 
court  record  not  submitted by the  movant  that  is  necessary  to  oppose  the  motion,  and  may 
include evidence ofrelevant matters not ofrecord in accordance with Rule 361 (a). 

-2-

(5)  The  Appellate  Court  may  order  additional  briefing,  record  submissions,  or  oral 

argument as  it deems appropriate.

Committee Comments 
(January 1,  2006) 

Paragraph (h)  was added effective January  1,  2006, to address the concerns of the bench and 
bar with respect to dispositive motions in the Appellate Court. Where a straightforward dispositive 
issue exists,  such as  an easily determinable lack of appellate jurisdiction, taking the motion with 
the  case delays the final  resolution of the case and greatly increases the burden on all  parties by 
forcing them unnecessarily to brief and argue the merits of the appeal.  Paragraph (h) requires that 
dispositive motions provide the necessary context,  including those portions of the record that are 
necessary to resolve the motion.  Where such context is provided, the rule provides that the court 
should resolve the dispositive motion "promptly after the filing of the objection, if any." 

Committee Comments 
(Revised May  1982) 

Rule 361  replaced former section 86.1  of the  Civil Practice Act,  former Supreme Court Rule 
49,  former Rule  3  of the  First District Appellate  Court,  and former  Rule  5  of the  other districts 
( earlier Unifonn Appellate Court Rule 5).  It applies to motions in all reviewing courts. Except for 
the  provisions  as  to  time,  the  rule  made  no  substantial  change  in the  preexisting  practice.  The 
argument  in  support  of a  motion,  if not  set  forth  in  the  motion  itself,  is  to  be  submitted  in  a 
memorandum in support of the motion, rather than in a document entitled "suggestions." The time 
provisions are designed to insure that the other parties have an opportunity to file  objections.  The 
number of copies  of documents  conforms  to  fonner requirements  in the  Supreme  Court and  all 
Appellate Court districts except the First District, which required an original and two copies.  The 
additional copy gives the clerk one for his file.  Paragraph (f) was new. 

Paragraph (g) was added in  1978, extending to civil cases a requirement formerly appearing in 

Rule 610(3) (58 Ill.  2d R.  610(3)), applicable only to criminal appeals.

Two clarifying changes were made in  1979.  The first  sentence of paragraph (a)  was  added to 
make it explicit that,  unless  otherwise provided for,  all  applications  for relief are to  be made  by 
motion,  and the provisions of former Rule 328, abrogated in  1979, were in substance transferred 
to paragraph (a) of this rule, where they appear as the third sentence.  The "short record" under the 
former practice is  called a "supporting record" in recognition of the fact that such a record serves 
the  sole purpose of supporting the motion and not as  a basis for docketing an appeal as the "short 
record" was under Rule 327 before its amendment in 1979. 

In  1981, paragraph ( c) was amended to require that copies of motions directed to a justice when 
the court is not in session must be sent to the other justices at their district chambers whenever the 
motion seeks relief that will require action by the full court. In  1982, it was amended to clarify this 
requirement. 

The rule has been reorganized and nonsubstantive additions are made.  Reference to  the 

former motion call practice of the Supreme Court in the First District has been deleted.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
