Does everyone who receives a Summons and 
 
 
Complaint/Petition have to file an Answer/Response 
to Complaint/Petition? 
 
There are two kinds of cases where you must appear in 
person but are not required to file a written 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition: 
 
o  The lawsuit is for money and involves $10,000 or 
 

 

less (this is called a small claims case). 

 

o  An eviction lawsuit (formerly called Forcible Entry 

 

and Detainer). 

Although you are not required to file an 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition before you go to 
court for these types of cases, the judge might order you 
 
to file an Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition after 
 
 
you go to court. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What forms do I need to fill out? 
 
The Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition. The email 
 
address (if you have one) and mailing address you put 
on the Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition is where 
 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
 
 
should use an email account that you do not share with 
anyone else and that you check every day. If you do not 
check your email every day, you may miss important 
information, notice of court dates, or documents from 
 
other parties. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
 
and-forms/approved-forms 
 

 

 

 

What costs will I need to pay to file my 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition? 
 
o  You may be required to file an Appearance at the 
same time you file your Answer/Response to 
 
Complaint/Petition. There is a fee for filing the 
Appearance. An Appearance form can be found at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 

o  Some courts do not require an Appearance. If your 
court does not require an Appearance, you will be 
charged an Appearance fee for filing your 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition. 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees. This is a 
separate set of forms you can find at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms.

instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or

What is an Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition? 
 
o 

It is your written response to the claims in the 
Plaintiff/Petitioner's Complaint/Petition. 

 

o  The Plaintiff/Petitioner is the person or company 
suing you and is named first in the court papers. 
o  The Complaint/Petition is the document that the 
 

 

 

Plaintiff/Petitioner filed and served upon you with the 
Summons. The Complaint/Petition explains the 
reasons the Plaintiff/Petitioner is suing you. 

 

o  Your Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition tells 

 

 

the court whether you agree or disagree with the 
Plaintiff/Petitioner’s reasons for suing you. 

 

Is there a deadline for filing an Answer/Response to 
 
Complaint/Petition? 
 
Yes. The Summons you received will tell you the 
 
 
deadline for filing your Appearance and 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition. For instructions 
 
on how to file your Appearance see also How to File an 
 
Appearance at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
 
 
forms/approved-forms. 
o  Your Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition is 

 

 

 

 

usually due at the same time as your Appearance. 
 
o  The Summons might give you a specific time frame 

 

 

 

o 

 

 

 

 

   

for filing your Answer/Response to 
Complaint/Petition: -for example, within 7 or 30 
 
 
days of when you received the Plaintiff/Petitioner’s 
Complaint/Petition. 
If the lawsuit is for money and involves more than 
 
$10,000 and up to $50,000, the Summons will tell 
you to appear in court at a specific date and time. 
 
You must file your Answer/Response to 
Complaint/Petition within 10 days of the date you 
 
appear in court. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Please be aware that if you have a legal reason to 
challenge the way the Summons and Complaint/Petition 
were received by you (service of process), or a legal 
 
reason to have the Complaint/Petition dismissed, you 
 
need to file a Motion before you file your 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition. 735 ILCS 5/2-
301; 735 ILCS 5/2-615.  You should consult with an 
attorney about whether you have a legal reason to 
 
challenge how the Complaint/Petition was received or 
whether you have a legal reason to have it

HOW TO PREPARE AND SEND AN 
ANSWER/RESPONSE TO COMPLAINT/PETITION 
 

o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

 

 

 

provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
 
help/how-to-e-file/. 

o 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your forms. 

 

 

 

 

•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 
 

 

a flash drive. 
  

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

that you can use to e-file your form. 

 

 
 

o 
 

 

Step 2: Send a copy of your Answer/Response to 
Complaint/Petition to the other parties. 
 
o  You must send your Answer/Response to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Complaint/Petition to the other parties in the case. If 
a party has a lawyer, send the Answer/Response to 
 
Complaint/Petition to the lawyer. 
 
If you and the person you're sending the 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition to have an 
 
 
email address, you must send it by email or by 
 
notification through the e-filing system. If you or the 
 
 
person you’re sending the Answer/Response to 
 
Complaint/Petition to does not have an email 
 
 
address, you may give it to the other parties by 
 
 
personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What happens if I am required to file an 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition but I do 
 
not? 
 
The judge will find you in default and may rule in favor of 
 
the Plaintiff/Petitioner. 
 
 
What if I think I may have Affirmative Defenses or 
 
Counterclaims? 
 
An affirmative defense is a legal reason why you are not 
responsible to the Plaintiff/Petitioner. If you have 
affirmative defenses, you have to include them in your 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition. Examples of 
 
affirmative defenses include: 
 
o 
that the Plaintiff/Petitioner waited longer than the 
 
 
law allows to file the Complaint/Petition; OR 
that the claim was already brought and resolved by 
 
 
another, earlier judgment. 735 ILCS 5/2-613 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These are just a few examples of affirmative defenses.  

 

 

 

 

  

Counterclaims are legal claims that you have against the 
 
Plaintiff/Petitioner regarding the issues in this case. The 
 
 
counterclaim must be filed at the same time as your 
 
 
Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition. 735 ILCS 5/2-
608. 
 
You may want to consult with a lawyer about whether 
you have affirmative defenses or counterclaims. 
 
 
What do I do after I fill out the Answer/Response to 
Complaint/Petition form? 
 
 
Step 1: File your Answer/Response to 
Complaint/Petition with the Circuit Clerk in the 
 
 
county where the court case is filed. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
available. 
  

 

 
• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 
 

 

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your 
 
 
 

 

 

 

Answer/Response to Complaint/Petition and the 
 
Certification with the Circuit Clerk’s office in 
person or by mail.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
