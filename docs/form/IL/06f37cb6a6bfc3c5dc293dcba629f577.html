Executive Summary 

The use of a statewide survey to obtain feedback from users of Illinois’ trial courts was 
one of the centerpiece recommendations resulting from the Supreme Court of Illinois' Future of 
the Courts Conference in 2013.  Following that recommendation, the Illinois Judicial Conference 
Committee  on  Strategic  Planning  and  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Illinois  Courts  (AOIC), 
under the leadership of the Supreme Court of Illinois, developed a court user survey framed from 
the  National  Center  for  State  Courts  CourTools'  Access  and  Fairness  Survey  template.    The 
survey  was  modified  and  expanded  utilizing  input  from  various  sources  including,  but  not 
limited to, the Illinois Conference of Chief Circuit Judges, the Access to Justice Commission and 
experts from Loyola University Chicago.  The final version of the survey was approved by the 
Supreme  Court  of  Illinois  for  implementation  statewide  in  the  Spring  of  2015,  and  as  a  result, 
completed  surveys  were  received  from  more  than  12,000  court  users  from  across  Illinois’  102 
counties. The major findings from the analyses of the surveys include: 

1) 

Illinois’ court users have a very positive view of the courts, as evidenced by responses to 
the  individual  statements  included  in  the  surveys  as  well  as  based  on  the  composite 
measures  of  perceived  “trust  in  the  courts”  and  the  “instrumental  quality  of  the  courts.”  
"Instrumental quality of the courts" was a measure that combined court users' assessments 
of being treated with courtesy and respect, the accessibility of courts, and the ability to get 
court business done in a timely manner and with available and easy-to-use forms. 
 

2)  Certain  respondent  characteristics were  consistently  related to  perceptions of trust  in  the 
courts, the instrumental quality of the courts, and having a positive opinion of the courts, 
including  race,  frequency  in  the  courthouse  over  the  past  year,  income  level,  and  the 
urban, suburban or rural characteristics of where respondents lived.  

3)  Although African-Americans reported somewhat lower perceptions of trust in the courts, 
the  instrumental  quality  of  the  courts,  and  having  a  positive  opinion  of  the  courts  than 
whites  or  Hispanics,  the  majority  of  African-Americans  held  neutral  to  positive  views 
across all three measures. 

4)  Respondents  who  indicated  it  was  their  first  time  in  the  courthouse  evaluated  the  courts 
more favorably across all three measures—trust in the courts, the instrumental quality of 
the  courts,  and  their  opinions  of  the  court  system—than  did  more  frequent  users  of  the 
courthouse. Still, regardless of how often the respondent had been in the courthouse, the 
majority held positive views across all three measures. 

5)  Respondents  with  higher incomes reported higher levels  of trust  in  the courts, had more 
favorable  assessments  of  the  instrumental  quality  of  the  courts,  and  were  more  likely  to 

2 

 

 

report  a  positive  view  of  the  court  system  than  those  with  lower  incomes.  Still,  the 
majority  of  those  with  low  incomes  (i.e.,  below  $25,000  per  year)  held  positive  views 
across all three measures. 

6) 

Individuals living in rural areas reported more favorable evaluations of the courts  across 
all three measures (trust, instrumental quality, and positive view of the court system) than 
those living in urban areas. However, the majority of those living in urban areas still held 
positive views across all three measures. 

7)  No  gender  differences  were  evident  in  terms  of  respondent  assessments  of  trust, 

instrumental quality, or positive view of the court system. 

8)  Somewhat more complex relationships were evident when respondent age and frequency 
of using the courthouse were examined across assessments of trust, instrumental quality, 
and  positive  view  of  the  court  system.  Young  respondents  (those  18  years  old  and 
younger)  reported  higher  levels  of  trust  in  the  courts  and  were  more  likely  to  hold  a 
positive view of the courts than middle-aged respondents (36 to 50 years of age), but those 
in the next age group (19-35) reported lower levels of trust in the courts than middle-aged 
respondents.  

9) 

Individuals  who  indicated  it  was  their  first  time  in  the  courthouse  evaluated  the  court 
particularly  favorably  across  all  three  measures—trust  in  the  courts,  the  instrumental 
quality  of  the  courts,  and  their  opinions  of  the  court  system.  The  least  favorable 
evaluations (again, across all three measures) were reported by those who said they came 
to the courthouse 3-6 times a year. 

10)  Lawyers  representing  clients  rated  the  instrumental  quality  of  the  courts  more  favorably 
than those who were not there for that purpose, and lawyers were also more likely to hold 
a  positive  view  of  the  court  system  than  the  other  respondents.  Also,  those  in  the 
courthouse for jury duty, or as a party to a case, were less likely to hold a positive view of 
the court system than those there for other purposes, and those in the courthouse for jury 
duty reported somewhat lower levels of trust in the court.  However, the majority of those 
in the courthouse for jury duty still held positive views across these measures. 
 

11)  Analyses  focused  only  on  non-attorney  respondents  found  levels  of  trust  in  the  courts, 
evaluations  of  instrumental  performance  of  the  courts,  and  positive  attitude  toward  the 
court system are explained almost entirely by individual characteristics of respondents or 
their cases, and are unrelated to the circuit in which the court resides.

Introduction  

The  notion  and  task  of  formally  inviting  court  user  feedback  concerning  Illinois'  trial 
courts  through  the  use  of  a  statewide  survey  was  one  of  the  centerpiece  recommendations 
resulting from  the Supreme Court of Illinois'  Future of the Courts Conference in  2013.   Under 
the  leadership  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Illinois,  in  2014  the  Illinois  Judicial  Conference 
Committee  on  Strategic  Planning  and  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Illinois  Courts  (AOIC) 
developed  a  court  user  survey  framed  from  the  National  Center  for  State  Courts  CourTools' 
Access  and  Fairness  Survey  template.    The  survey  was  modified  and  expanded  utilizing  input 
from various sources including but not limited to the Illinois Conference of Chief Circuit Judges, 
the  Access  to  Justice  Commission  and  experts  from  Loyola  University  Chicago.    The  final 
version  of  the  survey  was  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Illinois  for  implementation 
statewide in 2015.   

The  survey  was  designed  to  request  court  users exiting  state  courthouses  to  complete  a 
brief questionnaire regarding their experience in court and their opinion of the court system. A 
major goal of the survey was to assess the level of satisfaction and trust in the work of the court. 
Such matters may include users’ views on how well they were treated, how easily they were able 
to obtain information, whether they felt they were heard in court, and whether they perceived the 
end result as fair. 

Each  Chief  Circuit  Judge  was  provided  with  individualized  survey  instructions, 
marketing  materials  including  posters  and  sample  press  release  language,  English  surveys, 
Spanish  and  Polish  surveys  upon  request,  and  survey  deposit  boxes.    Each  county  within  each 
circuit was assigned a minimum number of surveys to complete based upon the county's volume 
of annual case filings.  Also taken into consideration were feasibility of collection and collecting 
enough surveys to provide meaningful data analysis for each county and circuit.   

With  the  generous  assistance  and  cooperation  of  the  circuit  courts,  the  survey  was 
conducted  in  every  state  courthouse  in  Illinois  from  April  13,  2015  to  May  1,  2015.    A  few 
counties  began  their  surveys  just  prior  to  the  April  13th  start  date  or  ended  their  survey 
implementation just after the May 1st end date in order to ensure they achieved collection of the 
assigned  minimum  number  of  completed  surveys.    Each  Chief  Circuit  Judge  had  discretion  to 
determine which days within this time period the survey would be conducted in his or her circuit.  
Instructions  provided  to  the  circuits  suggested  the  days  selected  be  typical  court  days  for  each 
site  and  sufficient  in  number  to  achieve  collection  of  the  assigned  minimum  number  of 
completed surveys for each county in the circuit.   

After  collection  of  the  surveys  was  complete,  all  survey  responses  were  tendered  to 
Loyola  University  Chicago  for  data  compilation  and  data  analyses.  The  surveys  were 

4 

 

 

individually  entered  by  students  with  faculty  oversight,  and  instances  where  surveys  had 
conflicting  responses  (i.e.,  multiple  responses  indicated  when  only  one  was  allowed)  were 
reviewed  and  modified  based  on  a  standardized  approach.  Data  entry  was  checked  through 
random samples of surveys being reentered and checked against the originally entered data, and 
this process indicated a high degree of data entry accuracy. Finally, frequencies of the responses 
to  each  question  were  generated  and  any  outliers  or  non-valid  responses  were  reexamined  and 
corrected.  The  data  were  then  analyzed  by  a  multi-disciplinary  team  of  faculty  at  Loyola 
University Chicago, including faculty from the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology 
and the Department of Political Science.   

The results of the statewide data analyses are presented herein. 

Methodology 

The goal of the survey was to gauge the views, attitudes, and experiences of those who 
access  courts  across  Illinois’  24  circuit  court  jurisdictions.1  The  survey  included  two  primary 
categories  of  questions,  with  the  first  set  of  questions  (questions  1  through  19)  primarily 
designed to gauge the general perceptions of the courts among all survey respondents, whether or 
not the respondent had actually been inside a courtroom or attended a court hearing. The second 
set  of  questions  (questions  20  through  31)  sought  to  gauge  respondents’  experiences  in  the 
courtroom and was only to be completed by those survey respondents who were in a courtroom 
on the day they completed the survey.2 The final version of the survey is included in Appendix I, 
and  Spanish  and  Polish  versions  of  the  survey  were  also  developed  and  made  available  to 
respondents.  The  Spanish  and  Polish  versions  of  the  survey  were  formatted  identically  to  the 
English  version.  Respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  the  degree  to  which  they  agreed  or 
disagreed  with  the  statements  included  on  the  survey,  ranging  from  1=strongly  disagree  to 
5=strongly agree. Respondents were given the option of answering “neither disagree nor agree,” 
with a value of 3, and if the respondent did not feel the question was applicable, they were asked 
to  select  “Not  Applicable.”  For  the  analyses  presented  below,  those  who  responded  “Not 
Applicable” were excluded from the analyses for that question. 

The  sampling  methodology  involved  having  each  of  Illinois’  102  counties  collect  a 
specific number of surveys (a quota), with the sample size varying depending on the total volume 
of court activity in the county  as measured by total court filings. Small counties were asked to 
collect  25  surveys  during  the  sampling  period  (April  13,  2015  to  May  1,  2015),  while  larger 

                                                           
1 Each of Illinois’ circuit court jurisdictions is made up of individual or multiple counties, and there are a total of 102 
counties in Illinois. 
2 Out of the more than 12,300 completed surveys, between 6,900 and 8,200 respondents answered questions 
regarding their experiences in the courtroom (those respondents who completed the questions regarding their 
experiences in the courtroom did not necessarily answer every one of questions 20 through 31). 

5 

 

 

jurisdictions, depending on their size, were asked to collect 75, 100, 200, 350, 500, or, in the case 
of  Cook  County,  2,000  surveys.3  Given  that  data  collection  occurred  across  102  different 
counties in the state, it was impossible to ensure a consistent method of participant recruitment; 
however,  the  AOIC  provided  some  general  instructions  to  each  circuit  to  increase  consistency 
and participation. See Appendix II for a sample of the instructions provided to the circuit courts 
by AOIC. 

The  overall  goal  was  to  collect  a  statewide  sample  of  11,000  surveys,  and  in  the  end, 
more than 12,300 usable surveys were returned, entered into a computer database, and analyzed. 
Because  there  are  no  existing  data  that  describe  the  typical  “court  user”  in  Illinois,  it  is  not 
possible to determine the degree to which the characteristics of those who completed the survey 
is representative of the overall population of citizens using the courts in Illinois. Summarized in 
Table 1 are the characteristics of those who completed the surveys, including their purposes for 
being at the courthouse, as well as their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. When 
asked “What did you do at the courthouse today,” almost 22 percent of those who completed the 
survey  indicated  that  they  had  attended  a  hearing  or  trial,  roughly  19  percent  were  attorneys 
representing  clients  in  court,  almost  10  percent  were  in  court  for  jury  duty,  and  roughly  10 
percent  were  in  court  to  search  records,  obtain  documents,  file  papers,  make  payments  or  get 
information at the courthouse. It is important to keep in mind that 13 percent of the respondents 
selected  multiple  categories  in  response  to  this  question,  and  thus  the  percentages  reported  in 
Table 1 are greater than 100 percent. 

The  most  often  reported  type  of  case  that  brought  the  respondents  into  the  courthouses 
were  criminal  cases,  and  specifically  domestic  violence  cases,  with  these  two  types  of  cases 
combined accounting for just over 30 percent of the respondents. As with the prior question,  6 
percent of respondents selected multiple case types, and thus, responses add up to more than 100 
percent.  Respondents  also  indicated  that  they  received  information  about  how  the  courts  work 
from  numerous  sources,  with  “personal  experience”  being  cited  by  roughly  40  percent  of  the 
respondents.  Again,  for  this  question,  25  percent  of  respondents  selected  multiple  sources  of 
information, and thus, responses add up to more than 100 percent. 

In terms of the demographic characteristics of the sample, 55 percent were male and 45 
percent were female.4 Although a large number of racial groups were represented in the sample, 
                                                           
3 Because the sample sizes from each county were not proportionately representative of total case filings in either 
their specific judicial circuit or the state as a whole, a weighting procedure was used so that the survey responses 
were representative of the volume of case filings in that jurisdiction. For example, if a county accounted for 2 
percent of the total surveys statewide, but only 1 percent of the total court filings statewide, the surveys from that 
county were weighted by .50 (1%/2%). This procedure ensured that counties that were over or under-represented in 
the survey responses were not given greater or lesser weight than they should have given that county’s 
representation among case filings in Illinois. 
4 Based on U.S. Census Bureau data for Illinois, in 2013 it was estimated that 51 percent of Illinois’ total population 
was female and 49 percent were male.  

6 

 

 

 

the  largest  percent  of  survey  respondents  was  white  (57  percent),  followed  by  African-
Americans  (20  percent),  Hispanics  (12  percent),  and  individuals  of  other  racial  groups  or  who 
identify  as  multi-racial  (11  percent).5  Other  characteristics  of  the  survey  respondents  worth 
noting was the small number of individuals under 18, and over 65 years of age, completing the 
survey,  and  the  relatively  large  proportion  of  respondents  (almost  30  percent)  who  reported 
having  an  advanced  or  professional  academic  degree.  This  relatively  high  level  of  education 
among  many  of  those  completing  the  survey  is  partially  explained  by  the  large  proportion  of 
survey  respondents  who  were  attorneys  representing  clients.  A  large  portion  of  those  who 
completed  the  survey  reported  that  this  was  their  first  time  in  the  courthouse  in  the  past  12 
months (25.5 percent of the respondents), and more than 20 percent reported having been in the 
courthouse only once or twice in the past year. On the other hand, more than 20 percent reported 
being in the courthouse weekly, and the majority of these individuals were made up of attorneys 
representing clients. One-half (49.9 percent) of the respondents self-reported that they lived in a 
suburban area, and less than 20 percent  of those  who completed the survey indicated that they 
lived in a rural area.

Analyses  of  the  survey  responses  were  performed  in  a  two-stage  process.  First,  the 
responses  to  each  of  the  individual  statements  included  in  the  survey  were  analyzed,  and  the 
general  patterns  evident  from  those  analyses  were  summarized.  Following  this,  additional 
analyses  were  performed  to  summarize  and  group  the  responses  to  individual  statements  into 
more  summary,  composite  measures  of  attitudes  and  opinions.  Finally,  multivariate  statistical 
analyses  were  performed  to  assess  and  statistically  isolate  the  degree  to  which  attitudes  and 
opinions varied across respondent characteristics, purposes for being in court, and circuits. 

Results: General Perception of the Courts 

In  order  to  summarize  the  responses  to  questions  1  through  19,  Table  2  includes  the 
distribution of responses across the categories of Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor 

9 

 

 

Disagree,  Agree,  or  Strongly  Agree.  In  addition  to  the  percent  of  respondents  answering  with 
each  of  those  attitudes,  Table  2  also  includes  the  average  response  (on  a  scale  from  1  to  5)  to 
each question, the percent of respondents in the combined category of “Agree + Strongly Agree,” 
and the percent of the respondents who either indicated the question was “not applicable” or left 
the  question  blank.  The  responses  of  not  applicable  were  not  used  in  the  computation  of  the 
percentage  or  mean  responses  to  the  questions.  The  questions  that  prompted  the  largest 
proportion of respondents to indicate that either it was not applicable, or simply left the response 
blank, were those that had to do with the court’s web-site (question 14), for which 42 percent of 
the  respondents  indicated  it  was  not  applicable  or  left  it  blank,  and  that  had  to  do  with  forms 
(questions 12 and 13), for which 18 percent of respondents indicated it was not applicable or left 
it blank. 

As  can  be  seen  in  Table  2,  across  each  of  the  individual  questions  the  majority  of 
respondents  who  had  an  opinion  agreed  or  strongly  agreed  with  each  statement,  ranging  from 
56.9 percent agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statement “Based on my experience in court 
today, I have more trust  in the court” (question 17) to 85 percent or more agreeing or strongly 
agreeing with the statements “I was treated with courtesy and respect by the court security staff,” 
(question  5),  “I  was  easily  able  to  physically  access  the  courthouse,”  (question  9),  and  “The 
courthouse  was  easy  to  find”  (question  10).  The  statement  that  elicited  the  most  disagreement 
was question 4, “Judges don't let their personal feelings about the issues or the people involved 
affect how they rule,” where 17.2 percent of the respondents disagreed with that statement; still, 
the majority—63.3 percent--of the respondents with an opinion, agreed with the statement posed 
in question 4.

Analyses  were  also  performed  to  gauge  the  degree  to  which  responses  to  questions  1 
through 19 were consistent with one another across respondents. In other words, did those who 
strongly  agree with  question 1 also  strongly  agree with  the other questions, and did  those who 
disagreed  with  one  question  also  tend  to  disagree  with  other  questions.  To  measure  this 
consistency, a measure of the strength of the correlation across responses to each of the questions 
was computed, and is summarized in Appendix  III.  Correlation coefficients can range from 0, 
indicating  no  correlation,  to  1,  indicating  a  perfect  correlation.  Generally  speaking,  the 
correlations  between the responses to  statements 1 through 19 were moderate (.367  to  .491) to 
strong (.606 to .786). 

Development of Composite Measures of Trust in the Courts and the Instrumental Quality 
of the Courts  

In order to summarize the responses to the question more effectively, analyses were also 
performed to determine the degree to which individual questions could be combined to produce a 
composite  measure  of  similar  concepts  raised  in  the  different  statements.  Using  a  technique 
called factor analysis, and existing research literature regarding public perceptions of the justice 

12 

 

 

system, responses to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, 18, and 19 emerged as related to perceptions that 
conceptually can be interpreted as “trust in the courts.”  

1. Judges make sure peoples' rights are protected. 

2. Judges follow the law.  

3. Judges try to reach the correct result in the cases they hear. 

4. Judges don't  let their personal  feelings about  the issues or the people involved affect       
how they rule. 

17. Based on my experience in court today, I have more trust in the courts. 

18. I trust the courts to reach a fair result for everyone involved. 

19. I trust the courts to protect everyone's rights. 

As described and presented in Table 2, above, the aggregate responses to each of these individual 
questions  indicated  relatively  high  levels  of  agreement  and  trust.  When  the  responses  to  these 
seven questions were combined, and divided by seven, to form a single measure of “trust in the 
courts,” the average score (on a scale from 1 to 5) was 3.9, and 57 percent of respondents had a 
combined response to these collective questions regarding trust as agree or strongly agree.  

Similarly, factor analysis revealed that the responses to question 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 
13 were related to each other, and when  combined and grouped together into a single measure 
can be conceptually viewed and interpreted as a composite measure of the “instrumental quality 
of the courts.” 

5. I was treated with courtesy and respect by the court security staff. 

6.  I  was  treated  with  courtesy  and  respect  by  the  court  staff.  (Excluding  judges  and 
security staff.) 

8. Courts are open at convenient times. 

9. I was easily able to physically access the courthouse. 

10. The courthouse was easy to find. 

11. I was able to get my court business done in a reasonable amount of time. 

12. The forms I needed were available. 

13. The forms I needed were easy to understand.

When  these  8  questions  were  combined,  and  divided  by  8,  to  form  a  single  measure  of  the 
“instrumental  quality  of  the  courts,”  the  average  (on  a  scale  from  1  to  5)  was  4.1,  and  70.3 
percent  of  respondents  had  a  combined  response  to  these  collective  statements  regarding  the 
instrumental quality of the courts as agree or strongly agree. 

Relationship  of  Perceptions  of  Trust,  Instrumental  Quality,  and  Opinion  of  the  Court 
System to Respondent Characteristics 

Analyses were also performed to determine the degree to which the composite measures 
of “trust in the courts” and the “instrumental quality of the courts,” and agreement to statement 
16  (“After  today,  my  opinion  of  the  court  system  is  positive”)7  were  related  to  various 
characteristics of the survey respondents, including the respondents’ demographic (age, race, and 
gender) and socio-economic (education level and income level) characteristics, the respondents’ 
purpose  for  being  in  the  courthouse  that  day  (the  type  of  case  and  the  specific  purpose),  their 
frequency  of  being  in  the  courthouse,  and  the  type  of  jurisdiction  where  they  live  (rural, 
suburban,  or  urban).  Summarized  in  Appendix  IV  are  the  results  of  the  three  separate 
multivariate  analyses  that  sought  to  gauge  the  degree  to  which  these  three  separate  measures 
(composite trust in the courts, composite instrumental quality of the courts, and “After today, my 
opinion  of  the  court  system  is  positive”)  were  related  to  each  of  these  characteristics,  after 
statistically  controlling  for  the  influence  of  the  other  respondent  characteristics.  Below  is  a 
summary of the findings from these analyses, and more detailed statistical tables resulting from 
the analyses are included in Appendices IV and V. 

Race: After statistically controlling for all of the other  respondent characteristics (i.e., all other 
characteristics being equal), whites and Hispanics held more favorable views  regarding trust in 
the courts, the instrumental quality of the courts, and opinions of the court system than did blacks 
or other/mixed races. Thus, across all three measures, consistent patterns were found. However, 
it should also be pointed out that while the difference in perceptions between whites and blacks 
was statistically significant, the magnitude of the difference on the trust scale (which could range 
from 1 to 5) was not that large. For the entire sample, the average score on the trust in the courts 
scale was 3.9; for blacks the average was 3.6 and for whites the average was 4.0, or a difference 
of 0.4 points. Similarly, the average score on the instrumental quality scale for the total sample 
was 4.2 (again, on a scale from 1 to 5), while specifically among black respondents the average 
response  was  3.9  and  for  whites  it  was  4.3.  On  the  other  hand,  when  asked  to  respond  to  the 
statement  “After  today,  my  opinion  of  the  court  system  is  positive,”  56.3  percent  of  blacks 
responded with a combined agree or strongly agree, compared to 75.1 percent of whites, a much 
larger difference than with the other two measures. 

                                                           
7 For the multivariate analyses, the response to statement 16 was recoded into a dichotomous variable, where agree 
and strongly agree were grouped together and the other responses were combined into a second category.

Age:  After  statistically  controlling  for  all  of  the  other  respondent  characteristics  (i.e.,  all  other 
characteristics  being  equal),  the  relationship  between  age  and  evaluations  of  the  court  shows 
some  evidence  of  non-linearity.  Young  respondents  (those  18  years  old  and  younger)  reported 
higher  levels  of  trust  in  the  courts  than  middle-aged  respondents  (36  to  50  years  of  age),  but 
those in the next age group (19-35) reported lower levels of trust in the courts than middle-aged 
respondents. Similarly, respondents who were 18 years old or younger were more likely to hold a 
positive opinion of the court system than were respondents who were 36 to 50 years of age. 

Education Level: After statistically controlling for all of the other respondent characteristics (i.e., 
all  other  characteristics  being  equal),  higher  educated  individuals  evaluated  the  instrumental 
quality of the courts more favorably than those with lower levels of education. In terms of trust 
in  the  courts,  college  graduates  reported  higher  levels  of  trust  in  the  courts  than  high  school 
graduates.  However,  there  was  little  evidence  of  other  substantively  meaningful  education-
related  differences  in  trust  in  the  courts,  and  education  levels  were  also  not  related  to  the 
respondents’ opinion of the court system. Thus, there were not consistent patterns found across 
the analyses of the three different measures. 

Gender: After statistically controlling for all of the other respondent characteristics (i.e., all other 
characteristics being equal), male and female respondents had similar views regarding their trust 
in the courts, the instrumental quality of the courts, and their opinions of the court system. Thus, 
across all three measures, consistent patterns were found. 

Frequency  in  the  Courthouse:  After  statistically  controlling  for  all  of  the  other  respondent 
characteristics (i.e., all other characteristics being equal), individuals who indicated it was their 
first time in the courthouse evaluated the court particularly favorably across all three measures—
trust in the courts, the instrumental quality of the courts, and their opinions of the court system. 
The  least  favorable  evaluations  (again,  across  all  three  measures)  were  reported  by  those  who 
said  they  came  to  the  courthouse  3-6  times  a  year.  Those  who  reported  having  been  in  a 
courtroom  that day did  not  evaluate the  courts differently  in terms  of trust  in  the courts or the 
instrumental quality of the courts, however, those who had been in a courtroom were more likely 
to  report  a  positive  view  of  the  court  system  than  were  those  who  were  not  actually  in  a 
courtroom that day. 

Income  Level:  After statistically controlling for  all of the other respondent  characteristics (i.e., 
all other characteristics being equal), higher income individuals reported higher levels of trust in 
the courts, had more favorable assessments of the instrumental quality of the courts, and report a 
positive view of the court system. Across all three measures, those who reported an income of 
more  than  $100,000  per  year  had  more  positive  views  than  those  reporting  annual  incomes  of 
less than $25,000 per year. 

15 

 

 

Urban,  Suburban  or  Rural  Characteristics  of  Where  Respondent  Lived:  After  statistically 
controlling  for  all  of  the  other  respondent  characteristics  (i.e.,  all  other  characteristics  being 
equal),  the  analyses  also  indicate  that  individuals  living  in  rural  areas  reported  more  favorable 
evaluations of the court across all three measures (trust, instrumental quality, and positive view 
of the court system). 

What  did  you  do  at  the  courthouse  today?  After  statistically  controlling  for  all  of  the  other 
respondent  characteristics  (i.e.,  all  other  characteristics  being  equal),  there  were  only  a  couple 
statistically  significant  relationships  that  emerged  between  the  purpose  for  being  in  the 
courthouse and the three measures of trust, instrumental quality, and positive view of the court 
system.  First,  lawyers  representing  clients  rated  the  instrumental  quality  of  the  court  more 
favorably than those who were not there for that purpose, and lawyers were also more likely to 
hold  a  positive  view  of  the  court  system  than  the  other  respondents.  Second,  those  in  the 
courthouse for jury duty, or as a party to a case, were less likely to hold a positive view of the 
court  system  than  those  there  for  other  purposes,  and  those  in  the  courthouse  for  jury  duty 
reported somewhat lower levels of trust in the court. 

Case Type:  After statistically controlling for all of the other respondent  characteristics (i.e., all 
other characteristics being equal), there were only a few relationships between the type of case 
the respondent was involved in and the measures of trust, instrumental quality, and positive view 
of the court system. First, those who were involved with divorce or custody issues reported lower 
levels of trust in the court than all other respondents. Second, respondents who were involved in 
a criminal case were significantly less likely to have a positive view of the court system than all 
other respondents, but being in the courthouse for a criminal case was not related to the measures 
of  trust  or  instrumental  quality.  In  fact,  none  of  the  case  types  were  statistically  related  to  the 
instrumental quality of the courts measure.   

Influence  of  Circuit-Level  Court  Characteristics  to  Perceptions  of  Trust,  Instrumental 
Quality, and Opinion of the Court System  

In addition to the individual characteristics of respondents influencing their reported trust 
in the courts, evaluation of the court’s instrumental performance, and positive attitude toward the 
court  system,  analyses  were  also  performed  to  assess  the  degree  to  which  circuit  court-level 
characteristics  may  influence  these  perceptions.  Since  respondents  from  the  same  circuit  may 
have similar experiences with court functions – resource constraints, difficulties accessing court, 
staff interactions – it is possible that respondents from the same circuit have similar assessments 
regarding the three measures of trust, instrumental quality, and positive view of the court system. 
Using  hierarchical  multivariate  regression  models,  three  additional  variables  about  each  of  the 
judicial  circuits  were  added  to  the  previous  analyses,  including  the  number  of  judges  in  the 
circuit, the number of new case filings per judge, and the number of new case filings per capita, 

16 

 

 

all  based  on  data  from  the  AOIC  2013  Annual  Statistical  Report,  and  more  detailed  statistical 
tables resulting from the analyses are included in Appendix VI.  Prior research has shown that 
court contextual variables, such as caseloads, resources, and size, can affect case processing and 
outcomes; these may, in turn, affect respondents’ perceptions of the court. 

Appendix  VI  presents  the  results  of  the  hierarchical  multivariate  regression  models  for 
the  measures  of  trust  in  the  courts,  evaluation  of  the  court’s  instrumental  performance,  and 
positive attitude toward the court system. These analyses examine how much of the variation in 
respondents’ perceptions are explained by the circuit-level characteristics where the courthouse 
resides.    These  analyses  excluded  lawyers  entering  the  courthouse  to  represent  a  client  and 
individuals  entering  the  courthouse  for  jury  duty;  the  purpose  was  to  examine  lay-peoples’ 
perceptions  of  the  court  and  to  assess  those  perceptions  unrelated  to  jury  duty.    Overall,  the 
results of these analyses indicated that none of the circuit-level factors were significantly related 
to respondents’ trust in the courts, instrumental quality of the courts, or positive attitudes towards 
the  court  system.  Further,  a  small  portion  of  the  variation  in  respondents’  reported  trust  and 
assessment of the instrumental quality of the courts can be explained by the circuit in which they 
reside  –  roughly  3  to  4  percent  of  the  variation  in  levels  of  trust  and  instrumental  quality  are 
explained by the circuit where the courthouse was located. Thus, respondents’ levels of trust in 
the courts, evaluations of instrumental performance of the courts, and positive attitude toward the 
court  system  is  explained  almost  entirely  by  individual  characteristics  of  respondents  or  their 
cases,  and  are  unrelated  to  the  circuit  in  which  the  court  resides.  Overall,  there  was  very  little 
variation in  levels  of trust  in the courts, evaluations of instrumental performance of the courts, 
and  positive  attitude  toward  the  court  system  once  the  characteristics  of  the  respondents  were 
taken into consideration. 

Results: Experience in Court Today 

Similar to the summary of questions 1 through 19, to summarize the responses to each of 
questions 20 through 31, Table 3 includes the distribution of responses across the categories of 
Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, or Strongly Agree. In addition 
to the percentage of respondents responding with one of these categories, Table 3 also includes 
the  average  response  (on  a  scale  from  1  to  5),  the  percentage  of  respondents  in  the  combined 
category  of  “Agree  +  Strongly  Agree”  and  the  percentage  of  the  respondents  who  either 
indicated not applicable or left the question blank. The responses of not applicable were not used 
in the computation of the percentage or mean responses to the questions. Importantly, responses 
to statements 20 through 31 were specifically sought for those who were in a courtroom the day 
the survey was completed. Thus, a much larger proportion of the responses to these statements 
were  indicated  as  being  not  applicable  or  left  blank  since  not  all  of  those  who  completed  the 
survey were actually in a courtroom (i.e., they may have been there to file paperwork, meet with 
their  probation  officer,  etc).  As  described  in  the  introduction,  out  of  the  more  than  12,300

completed surveys, roughly 6,900 to 8,200 respondents answered questions 20 through 31 (those 
respondents  that  completed  the  questions  regarding  their  experiences  in  the  courtroom  did  not 
necessarily answer every one of questions 20 through 31). 

As  can  be  seen  in  Table  3,  across  each  of  the  individual  questions  the  majority  of 
respondents  who  had  an  opinion  agreed  or  strongly  agreed  with  each  statement,  ranging  from 
71.1 percent agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statement “At the beginning of court today, 
the  judge  explained  what  to  expect  in  the  courtroom”  (question  21)  to  82  percent  or  more 
agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statements “I was treated with courtesy and respect by the 
judge,”  (question  27)  and  “I  was  able  to  understand  the  language  used  in  the  courtroom” 
(questions 30). The question that elicited the most disagreement was question 20, “Court started 
on  time  today,”  where  18.9  percent  of  the  respondents  disagreed  with  that  statement.  Still, the 
majority – 71.9 percent – of the respondents with an opinion, agreed with the statement posed in 
question 20.

Analyses  were  also  performed  to  gauge  the  degree  to  which  responses  to  questions  20 
through 31 were consistent with one another across respondents. In other words, did those who 
strongly agreed with question 20 also strongly agree with the other questions, and did those who 
disagreed  with  one  question  also  tend  to  disagree  with  other  questions.  To  measure  this 
consistency, a measure of the strength of the correlation across responses to each of the questions 
was computed, and is summarized in Appendix III.  Correlation coefficients can range from 0, 
indicating  no  correlation,  to  1,  indicating  a  perfect  correlation.  Generally  speaking,  the 
correlations  between  the  responses  to  statements  20  through  31  were  moderate  (.49)  to  strong 
(.80). 

Conclusions 

This first-ever attempt to gauge the attitudes and views of Illinois’ court users produced a 
number  of  findings  that  can  be  seen  as  encouraging  by  Illinois  court  practitioners  and  policy 
makers,  and  also  provides  some  insight  into  possible  areas  for  improvement.  First,  the  data 

19 

 

 

collection process involved the coordination and effort of many people from across Illinois’ 102 
counties, and 24 judicial circuits, and resulted in the collection of a large number of completed 
surveys over a relatively brief period of time. Second, the general patterns and results evident in 
the collected data is that those who use Illinois’ courts have a very positive view of the courts, as 
evidenced  by  responses  to  the  individual  statements  as  well  as  from  the  developed  composite 
measures  of  perceptions  of  trust  in  the  courts  and  the  instrumental  quality  of  the  courts.

Appendix II:  Sample of Instructions Provided to Circuit Courts from the Administrative Office of the 
Illinois Courts Regarding Survey Completion 

Thank you for your participation in the statewide court-user survey.  The design of the survey is to ask court-
users exiting the courthouse to complete a brief survey regarding their experience in court and their opinion of 
the court system. The individuals surveyed include but are not limited to litigants and their families and friends, 
victims  and  witnesses,  attorneys  (including  assistant  state's  attorneys  and  public  defenders),  law  enforcement 
officers, jurors, individuals doing record searches or having other business at the clerk’s office and individuals 
conducting any other type of court business. Because the survey is designed to assess the views of the court’s 
users, judges and court staff are excluded.  

umber of Surveys to Complete 

Each  county  in  the  State  will  be  assigned  a  minimum  number  of  surveys  to  complete.    The  counties  in  the 
___________  Judicial Circuit have been assigned the following minimum number of surveys to complete: 

urvey Locations and Times 

The court-user survey must be conducted in every courthouse in every Circuit within the period from April 13, 
2015 to May 1, 2015.  It is within the discretion of the Chief Judge and his/her designees as to what days within 
this time period the survey should be conducted in the Circuit.  The days chosen need not be consecutive and 
need not be the same in every courthouse, as long as the days chosen are typical for each site, within the above 
date range and achieve collection of the assigned minimum number of completed surveys for each county in the 
Circuit.  Once a schedule is finalized, be sure to notify need-to-know court staff (e.g. court security) of the day 
and times the survey will be administered. 

urvey Administration and Supplies 

Each  Circuit  is  free  to  administer  the  survey  in  whatever  way  will  achieve  the  collection  of  the  assigned 
minimum number of completed surveys for each county in the Circuit.  It is suggested that survey tables and 
chairs be placed around the exits to the courthouse and posters be placed conspicuously around the entrances to 
the facilities announcing  the survey.  Each Circuit will be provided with survey  forms,  survey deposit  boxes, 
and posters.  All  other supplies will be the responsibility of the Circuit.  Be sure to  provide pens/pencils and 
hard surfaces for completing the survey (e.g. clipboards or tables.)  You have also been provided with a sample 
press release should you choose to issue a press release in your Circuit. 

urvey Staff and Training 

The Chief Circuit Judge or Presiding Judge may designate a leader from court staff or the Circuit Clerk's Office 
to  oversee  the  survey  implementation  in  each  courthouse.    The  Circuit  may  utilize  court  staff,  clerk's  office 
employees or volunteers to conduct the survey.  Examples of such volunteers include college, graduate or law 
students, service club members (e.g. Kiwanis Club, Rotary Club, League of Women Voters, etc.), JusticeCorps 
members or retired court employees.  If using court staff for implementation, criteria for staff selection might 
include  friendliness,  bilingual  skills,  and  poise.    The  size  of  the  team  to  hand  out  surveys  and  facilitate 
completion and return will vary according to the maximum number of individuals exiting the courthouse during 
any hour of the day.  Arrangements should be made to rotate survey staff in staggered intervals to avoid fatigue 
and boredom while maintaining continuity.   

olunteers and court staff conducting the surveys should receive instructions.  A brief orientation session and 
walk-through  of  arrangements  should  precede  the  data  collection.    At  a  minimum,  survey  staff  should  be 
instructed: 

  To solicit court-users who are exiting the courthouse and not those that are entering;   
 
  To write in or stamp the name and address of the court facility at the bottom of each survey and the date; 
  To direct court-users to complete the survey immediately and not take the survey with them to complete 

later;

  To inform the survey takers that the surveys are anonymous; and 
  To direct survey takers to place completed questionnaires in the survey deposit box which makes it clear 

to survey takers that their responses are anonymous and confidential.  
 

Survey staff may be provided scripted greetings and answers to questions.  Suggested opening lines include:  

  "Do you have a moment to tell us how you were treated today?" 
  "Please tell us how we can serve you better." 

  "We  are  improving  customer  service  in  the  court.    Do  you  have  a  minute  to  complete  this  customer 

service survey?" 

  "Please tell us about your experience today." 

xamples of objections to taking the survey and possible answers include: 

  Objection: “You don’t want to know what I think!”  

Answer:  “Yes we do, especially if it was a bad experience!” 
  Objection: “This is my first time. I am not qualified to answer!”   

Answer: “You are just the person we need to hear from, you have a unique perspective.” 

  Objection: “This doesn’t pertain to me” (typically from attorneys or police who appeared in court)  

Answer: “Please complete it from your perspective.”  

  Objection: “I am just here to file a paper, this doesn’t apply to me.”  

Answer: “We want to hear from everybody.” 

urvey Return 

Survey boxes and posters need not be returned to the Administrative Office.  To ensure uniformity and integrity 
of the survey process, please return the completed surveys without review in a secure envelope(s) by  May 8, 
2015 to:  
Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts 
Attention: Adam Brown 
222 N. LaSalle, 13th Floor 
Chicago, Illinois 60601 
Please keep the survey responses separated by county.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
