Re: 

Electronic Civil  Law Citation and Complaint Form 

The  Conference of Chief Circuit Judges, at its  meeting on  September  16,  2022,  approved  changes to 
the Electronic Civil Law Citation and Complaint Form (e-Civil Law Citation).  The approved updates 
are  part  of the  procedural  changes  resulting  from  the  Public  Act  101-0593  which  authorized 
recreational use of cannabis effective January  I, 2020.  Section 3.5 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control 
Act  was  removed  from  the  citation  which  originally  contained  violations  for  possession  of drug 
paraphernalia.  The  Printing  Instructions  have  also  been  updated  to  allow  Circuit  Court  QR  codes, 
violator·s email  address and  mobile number and  are included with this filing. 

On behalf of the Conference of Chief Circuit Judges,  I hereby submit the approved citation form  and 
printing instructions to your office for filing pursuant to Supreme Court Rule  552.  The new form  and 
printing instructions are effective January  I, 2023. 

Agencies must contact their electronic citation vendor to notify them of the changes as soon as possible 
to ensure the new citations are available no  later than July  I, 2023. 

Effective July  I, 2023, all  Electronic Civil Law Citations issued by any law enforcement agency must 
comply with the new  form  filed herein. 

Respectfully, 

David L Vancil, Jr., Chair 
Conference of Chief Circuit Judges

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
