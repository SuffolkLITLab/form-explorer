      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre> 

•  Rule 304(a): When the trial court (1) enters a 
final judgment that ends only part of the case; 
and (2) says that this judgment can be appealed 
(which is called a “special finding”), you must file 
your Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 days after 
 
the special finding. But, if any party files a 
Motion to Reconsider (or similar post-judgment 
motion) within 30 days after the special finding, 
you must file Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 
days after the trial court rules on the Motion to 
Reconsider. 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Rule 304(b): When the trial court (1) enters a 
final judgment that ends only part of the case; 
and (2) the judgment is one that is listed in Rule 
304(b), such as a child custody order, you must 
file your Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 days 
after the trial court enters that judgment. But, if 
any party files a Motion to Reconsider (or similar 
post-judgment motion) within 30 days after the 
judgment, you must file your Notice of Appeal 
(Civil) within 30 days after the trial court rules on 
the Motion to Reconsider. 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Rule 307: You may appeal some orders that do 
not end any part of the case. Those orders are 
listed in this rule. 

 

•  Rule 307(a): To appeal an order listed in Rule 

307(a) (such as a termination of parental rights), 
you must file your Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 
30 days after the trial court enters the order. 

 

 

 

•  To appeal an order under Rule 307(a) that was 
entered without notice to you, you must first file 
a Motion to Vacate the order in the trial court. If 
the trial court denies your Motion to Vacate, you 
must file your Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 
days after your Motion is denied. But, if the trial 
court does not rule on your Motion to Vacate 
within 7 days after you file it, you must file your 
Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 days after 
 
those 7 days are up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Rule 307(d): To appeal a temporary restraining 

order (or the denial of one), you must file your 
Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 2 days after the 
 
date of the order (or denial). 

 

 

o  To figure out the deadline to file your Notice of 

 

 

 

Appeal (Civil), count from the day after the trial court 
entered the order or judgment. You must count 
weekends and holidays. If the deadline to file falls on 
 
a weekend or holiday, you may file the Notice of 
Appeal (Civil) on the next business day. If you file it 
by mail or by third-party commercial carrier (because 
you have an exemption from e-filing, see Step 2 
below), the date you send it is also the date of filing, 
as long as you follow the instructions for the Proof of 
Service. 

 
 

 

What is a Notice of Appeal (Civil)? 
 
 
o  A Notice of Appeal (Civil) is a form you file with the 
 
 
trial court to start the appeal of a trial court order or 
judgment. 

 

Who can use the Notice of Appeal (Civil) form? 
 
o 

In a civil case, you can use the Notice of Appeal 
(Civil) if the trial court entered an order or judgment 
against you that can be appealed. 

 

 

 

o  Businesses other than sole proprietorships cannot 
represent themselves in the appellate court. If you 
are a business, please talk to a lawyer. 

 

   

What forms do I need to fill out to file the Notice of 
Appeal (Civil)? 
 
 
o  Notice of Appeal (Civil): This form tells the trial 

 

 

 

 

court that you are appealing its order or judgment. 
The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
you put on the Notice of Appeal (Civil) is where 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share with 
anyone else and that you check every day. If you do not 
 
check your email every day, you may miss important 
information and documents from other parties. 

 

 

 

 

 

When do I need to use the Notice of Appeal (Civil) 
 
form? 
 
o 

In all cases under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 301, 
you must file your Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 
days after the trial court enters the final judgment in 
your case. But, if any party files a Motion to 
Reconsider (or similar post-judgment motion) within 
30 days after the final judgment, you must file your 
Notice of Appeal (Civil) within 30 days after the trial 
court rules on the Motion to Reconsider. 
 

 

 

 

 

o  However, Illinois Supreme Court Rules say that 

some orders and judgments can be appealed before 
the trial court enters the final judgment. For 
example:

instructions can be found at:

o  You may ask for more time to file your Notice of 
Appeal (Civil) by filing a Motion for Extension of 
Time with the appellate court within 30 days after 
your Notice of Appeal (Civil) was originally due. You 
must attach your Notice of Appeal (Civil) to the 
Motion and pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford to 
pay the filing fee, you can ask the court to file for 
free by filing the Application for Waiver of Court Fees 
(Appellate) found at:  illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms.  You can also find a 
Motion form you can use at this link. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

o  The appellate court does not have to give you more 

 

time to file your Notice of Appeal (Civil). The 
appellate court may dismiss your appeal if you do 
not have a “reasonable excuse” for filing a late 
Notice of Appeal (Civil). 

 

 

 

 

 

What costs will I need to pay to file my Notice of 
Appeal (Civil) form? 
 
o  None. But you will have to pay a fee when you file 
your Request for Preparation of Record on Appeal 
with the trial court and when you file the Docketing 
Statement in the appellate court. 

 

 

How do I fill out the Notice of Appeal (Civil) form? 
 
o  The Notice of Appeal (Civil) tells the trial court, the 
appellate court, and the other party (or parties) that 
you are appealing one or more trial court orders. 
The Notice of Appeal (Civil) also says what relief you 
are seeking from the appellate court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Notice of Appeal (Civil) form contains instructions 
 
for each section. See below for more instructions on how 
 
to fill out each section on the Notice of Appeal (Civil) 
 
form: 
 
Case Name 
o  Check the top box if the appeal involves the best 

 

interests of a child. 

 

o  Enter the appellate district that will hear your appeal. 
There are five appellate districts in the State of 
Illinois. The appellate district that will hear your 
appeal is the one where the trial court (that ruled on 
your case) is located. For help determining which 
appellate district will hear your appeal, click here: 
 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Appellate_Court. 
o  Enter the county where the trial court is located. 
o  Some cases, like marriage cases, are given titles 
beginning with “In re” (e.g., “In re Marriage of 
Jones”). If your case had such a title in the trial 
court, enter it after “In re.” Then, whether or not your 
case had such a title, enter the names of the parties 
as they appeared in the trial court. (Some cases, like 
name-change cases, have only one party.) 
 

o  Do not enter the full name of a child or a recipient of 
mental-health services; instead, use that person’s 
first name and last initial. 

o 

Identify which party is the appellant by checking the 
“appellant” box under that party's name (the 
appellant is the party who started the appeal). Next, 
identify which party is the appellee by checking the 
“appellee” box under that party's name (the appellee 
is the party who is responding to the appeal). 
o  Enter the trial court case number, the name of the 
trial court judge, and the Supreme Court Rule that 
allows the appellate court to hear the appeal. 

Section 1 
 
o  Check the box to indicate the type of appeal you are 

filing: 

•  Check “Appeal” if you are the first appellant and 
you are appealing a final judgment that ended all 
or part of the case. 

•  Check “Interlocutory Appeal” if you are the first 
appellant and you are appealing an order under 
Rule 307. 

•  Check “Joining Prior Appeal” if you are the 

second appellant and you are adding your name 
to the first appellant’s Notice of Appeal (Civil).  In 
this appeal, two appellants proceed together 
against the appellee. For example, if two 
 
roommates are evicted and one roommate 
appeals the eviction, the other roommate can 
join the appeal. 

  

 

•  Check “Separate Appeal” if you are the second 

 

appellant but you are not joining the first 
appellant’s Notice of Appeal (Civil). In this 
appeal, you can go against different appellees or 
attack different orders than the first 
appellant. For example, if two roommates are 
evicted and one roommate appeals only the 
eviction order, the other roommate can file a 
separate appeal to attack an order for past-due 
rent. 

 

 

•  Check “Cross Appeal” to respond to the 

 

appellant’s appeal and also file your own appeal 
against the appellant. In this appeal, you are the 
“cross appellant” and can attack an order or part 
of an order that wrongly gave relief to the 
appellant. For example, if a landlord gets an 
eviction order against a tenant but the court 
does not award past-due rent, the tenant can 
appeal the eviction and the landlord can cross 
appeal the denial of rent. 

Section 2 
 
o  Fill in the name of every person who is filing the 

appeal. Check the box to show if that person was a 
plaintiff/petitioner or defendant/respondent in the trial 
court case.

o 
 

If you and the person you're sending the Notice of 
 
Appeal (Civil) to have an email address, you must 
send it by email or by notification through the e-filing 
system. If you or the person you’re sending the 
Notice of Appeal (Civil) to does not have an email 
 
address, you may give it to the other parties by 
personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 
 
o  Complete the Proof of Service with information to 

 

 

 

 

 

show how you sent your Notice of Appeal (Civil) to 
 
each party. The Proof of Service has room for 3 
parties. If you are sending your Notice of Appeal 
 
(Civil) to more than 3 parties, fill out and insert one 
or more Additional Proof of Service forms into the 
 
Notice of Appeal (Civil) form. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 2: File the Notice of Appeal (Civil) with the clerk 
of the trial court where your trial court case was 
heard. 
 
o  You must file the Notice of Appeal (Civil) with the 

 

 

 

 

 

trial court by the filing deadline that applies to your 
 
case. For examples of filing deadlines, see the 
section above titled "When do I need to use the 
Notice of Appeal (Civil) form?". 
 
 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
 

 

 

 

 

•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
available. 
 

 
• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

 

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
 

 

o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

 

provider. 
 
 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
 
help/how-to-e-file/. 

   

Section 3 
 
o  Fill in the date of the order or judgment you are 
 

 

appealing from. You may also challenge any other 
 
order that led to the entry of the order or judgment 
you are appealing from. Fill in the dates of any such 
orders you wish to challenge. If you do not, the court 
may not consider them. 
 

 

 

 
Section 4 
 
Say what type of relief you want from the appellate 
court.  In general, the types of relief are: 
 
o 
 

  

 

 

   

“Reverse the judgment.” This means the appellate 
court changes the judgment in your opponent’s 
favor into a judgment in your favor. For example, if 
you were the defendant and you argue that the 
plaintiff (who won the case) failed to prove his case, 
you want the appellate court to change the judgment 
in the plaintiff’s favor into a judgment in your favor. If 
 
other hearings are needed, you may also ask the 
court to send the case back to the trial court for 
those hearings. 
“Vacate the judgment.” This means the appellate 
court erases the judgment in your opponent’s favor. 
Usually, the appellate court then sends the case 
back to the trial court for a new hearing. For 
example, if you were the defendant and you argue 
that the trial was unfair, you are arguing that the 
appellate court should erase the judgment in the 
plaintiff’s favor and send the case back to the trial 
court for a new trial and a new judgment. 
 
“Change the judgment.” This means the appellate 
court changes what the judgment says. For 
example, if you argue that the trial court awarded 
you an amount that was too low, you may ask the 
appellate court to change the award to a higher 
amount. 
 

 

 

You may also ask the appellate court to give (or to tell 
 
the trial court to give) any other relief you think is 
proper. 
  

   

 

After you say what relief you want, sign and print your 
 
name and fill in your address, phone number, and email 
address, if you have one. If anyone else is appealing 
with you, they must sign and print their own name; you 
cannot do it for them. 
 
 
Proof of Service 
 
Show how you are sending your Notice of Appeal (Civil) 
 
to the other parties (see Step 1 below). 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the form? 
Step 1: Serve the Notice of Appeal (Civil) on all other 
parties. 
 
o  You must send your Notice of Appeal (Civil) to the 

 

 

 

 

 

other parties in the case.  However, if any party has 
  
a lawyer, you must send your Notice of Appeal 
 
(Civil) to the lawyer.

o 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, bring your form to the trial court 
clerk's office or appellate court clerk's office where 
you can use a public computer terminal to e-file your 
form. 
 

 

•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

a flash drive. The terminal will have a scanner 
and computer that you can use to e-file your 
 
form. 
 
 

Step 3: You must file a Docketing Statement, along 
with an appearance fee, in the appellate court within 
14 days after filing the Notice of Appeal (Civil).
