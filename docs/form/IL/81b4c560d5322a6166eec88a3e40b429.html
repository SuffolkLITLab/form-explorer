HOW TO FILE A PETITION FOR REHEARING 

  Cover 

The Supreme Court will then issue a new decision.  
However, the grant of a Petition for Rehearing does 
not guarantee that the new decision will reach a 
different result. 

o  Request an answer from your opponent without 

granting your Petition for Rehearing.  If the Supreme 
Court sees possible merit in your Petition for 
Rehearing, it may request your opponent to file an 
answer in 21 days or in some other time frame, and it 
will give you 14 days or in some other time frame to 
file, if you wish, a reply to your opponent’s answer.  
The Supreme Court will then either deny your Petition 
for Rehearing or grant it and issue a new decision. 

 

 

The Proof of Service has room for 3 parties. If you 
are sending your Petition to more than 3 parties, fill 
out and insert one or more Additional Proof of 
Service forms into the main form. 

OTE: Before ruling on your Petition for Rehearing, the 
Supreme Court may send you a notice to appear for oral 
argument.  However, oral argument on a Petition for 
Rehearing is extremely rare. 

tep 2: File your Petition with the Supreme Court. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer; or (2) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing.  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do not 
have internet or computer access at home and it 
would be difficult for you to travel to a place 
where you could use a computer, (2) you have a 
disability that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English.  
•  Fill out a Certification for Exemption from E-Filing 
found here: You can find the forms online at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/supreme/supre
me.asp 

•  Deliver the Certification, your original Petition for 
Rehearing, and 13 copies to the Supreme Court 
Clerk’s office in person, by mail, or by third-party 
commercial carrier (e.g., FedEx or UPS). 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

provider.  
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
user guides here: 
illinoiscourts.gov/CivilJustice/Resources/Self-
Represented_Litigants/self-represented.asp  
If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, bring your form to the Supreme 
Court Clerk's office where you can use a public 
computer terminal to e-file your form.  
•  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 

flash drive.  

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 

that you can use to e-file your form.  

tep 3: Wait for a ruling by the Supreme Court.  

The Supreme Court will do one of the following: 
o  Deny your Petition for Rehearing.  If the Supreme 
Court sees no merit in your Petition for Rehearing, 
the court will deny it.  The denial could take the form 
of a modified decision, which will reach the same 
result, or a separate order. 

o  Grant your Petition for Rehearing.  If the Supreme 
Court sees merit in your Petition for Rehearing, the 
court will grant it.  Your opponent will have 21 days to 
file an answer, and you will have 14 days to file, if 
you wish, a reply to your opponent’s answer.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
