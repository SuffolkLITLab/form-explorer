Juvenile records that . are . not expunged cannot be seen by the ge. neral public, but. they . may be seen by law enforcement agencies, some. employers, . and some government agencies (usually through use of . . fingerprint. -based background checks. in applications for . subsidized housing or jobs in schools, healthcare, childcare, . . or se. curity. ) . . When can I begin the juvenile expungement . process? . o In order to expunge juvenile records, . all the juvenile court . proceedings related to the arrests and cases you are . . seeking to expunge. must be. closed. . o If you are expunging a juvenile record in which a . judge . . found you guilty of a Class A misdemeanor or a felony, . it must . be at least . 2 . years since your court case ended . (including the end of any sentence such as probation) . . . How long will it take to expunge . my juvenile record? . It will take . approximately 120 days. from the date you file the . Request. to the time when the record is expunged. . o When you . file. to expunge your record, a hearing. will be . scheduled in 45 days.

What costs . do. I need to pay to expunge (erase) my . juvenile record. s? .

Arrests and Prosecutions) sheet from the . Chicago Police Depart. ment. . However, many municipalities do not issue . juvenile RAP sheets and instead will provide . . you with juvenile arrest information in a different . format. . What steps do I need to take to have my juvenile . record expunged (erased) ? . o Step 1: Get copies of your. juvenile records. . o Step 2: Review your juvenile records and figure . . out if you can apply for expungement. . o Step 3: Fill out the expungement forms. . o Step 4: File the forms with the Circuit Clerk and . . get a court date. .

If you are unsure if you were arrested, contact . the law enforcement agency that you . believe . arrested you. . o Juvenile Court Records: If you . were. charged with . a crime in juvenile court, a juvenile court record . exists. If you were under 18 but charged in adult . . criminal court, you have an adult criminal record. .

Between 2010 and 2013, 17 years olds arrested for misdemean. ors were given . juvenile records, while 17 year olds arrested for felonies were given adult records. The police department that arrested you should be able to tell you if . your arrest record is a juvenile or adult record. . State of Illinois . . Instruction Book. let. for . Juvenile Expungement.
