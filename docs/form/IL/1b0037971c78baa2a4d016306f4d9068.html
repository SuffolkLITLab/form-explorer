Where can I find the form I need?

If you cannot afford to pay the cost, you can ask 
the court to file for free. Fill out the Application for 
Waiver of Court Fees to ask the court for a fee 
waiver. This is a separate set of forms you can find 
at: http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	 

 

 

Fill out the Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
 
Bank following the instructions on the form.

served and the address where you will send the debtor 
 
notice. See Steps 2 and 3. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the Citation to Discover
 
 
Assets to Debtor's Bank?
 
 
Step 1: File your forms with the Circuit Clerk in the
 
 
county where the court case is filed.
 
 
o	  Call the Circuit Clerk for a court date, time, and 
courtroom number for your Citation to Discover 
 
Assets to Debtor's Bank. The bank is required to 
 
respond by this time. 

 

 

 

o	  Write the courthouse address, court date, time, and 
courtroom number on the Citation to Discover 
Assets to Debtor's Bank. 

o	  Ask the Circuit Clerk how much it will cost to file 

 

 

your form and what types of payment (cash, check, 
credit, online) they take. 

 

 

o	  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
unless you qualify for an exemption from e-filing. 
•	  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer, (2) you 
have a disability that keeps you from e-filing, or 
 
 
(3) you have trouble reading or speaking 
English. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	  Fill out a Certification for Exemption from E-

 

Filing found here: 
www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default. 
asp. 

   

•	  File the original and 1 copy of your Citation 
form,  and  the  Certification,  with  the  Circuit 
Clerk’s office in person or by mail. 

   

What is a Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
 
Bank? 
A Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank is a court 
 
document that tells the bank to answer questions about 
 
 
the debtor’s property and income. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who can file a Citation to Discover Assets to 
 
Debtor's Bank? 
Anyone who has won a judgment for money against 
 
another person or business can file a Citation to 
Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank to try to collect the 
money. 
o	  The person who won the judgment is called the 

   

 

 

 

o	  The person who owes the money is called the 

 

   

“creditor.” 

“debtor.” 

o	  The debtor's bank is called the “respondent.” 

 

Using the Citation, the creditor can try to get that 
property or income to pay the judgment if they are not 
 
protected by law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What if my judgment is over 7 years old? 
 
o	 

If your judgment is over 7 years old, you will need to 
renew (“revive”) your judgment before you can do a 
Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank. To 
start the process, file and serve a Petition for 
Revival. 
 

o	  You can renew (“revive”) a judgment only up to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	 

20th year from the date of your judgment. 
If your judgment is over 27 years old, you cannot 
 
enforce your judgment. 

 

 

   
 

 

 

 

 
Who do I serve the Citation on? 
 
o	  You must use the bank’s correct legal name. You 
may call the bank and ask them their correct legal 
name. You may even ask where they prefer legal 
papers to be delivered. If the receptionist does not 
know, ask for a bank officer. Do not give them the 
name of your debtor. 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  Serve the bank's registered agent or any officer at 
 
any branch. You do not need to know which branch 
was used by the debtor. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  You can use the Secretary of State’s website to find 

 
a bank’s registered agent: 
http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/ 

 

 

o	  NOTE: you cannot use this form if the bank is not 

 

 

 

 

 

doing business in Illinois. 

 

 

What forms do I need for the Citation to Discover 
 
 
Assets to Debtor's Bank? 
 
o	  Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank: 
 
tells the bank to answer questions about the 
debtor's property and income.

If by Certified Mail 
 
•	  The Citation may also be served by Certified 
 

 

Mail, restricted delivery, return receipt 
 
requested. 
 

 

 

o	  NOTE: If you e-filed your Citation and you want to 
 
 
use the sheriff to serve the Citation, contact your 
 
 
sheriff's office to ask if the sheriff will file the 
Return/Affidavit of Service or if you will have to e-
file it. If you use a private process server, you or 
 
the process server will have to file the 
 
Return/Affidavit of Service when you receive it 
 
back. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 3: Mail a copy of the Citation to Discover 
 
  
Assets to Debtor's Bank to the debtor. 
 
o	  The person serving the Citation must send a copy 
 
 
 
of the Citation to the debtor by regular first-class 
mail within 3 days after service upon the bank. If 
 
you use certified mail, wait at least 3 days before 
 
mailing the copy of the Citation to the debtor. If you 
 
mail too quickly, you will notify the debtor and they 
 
 
will take their money out of the account. If you wait 
 
too long to mail the copy, you will not be following 
 
 
 
the law. 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 4: If you have not received the Answer from 
 
the bank, contact the sheriff or private process 
server to confirm they served your forms on the 
 
bank. 
o	  Before court, you should check on whether the 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bank was served. This is called the Return/Affidavit 
 
of Service. You may be able to check this online. 
 
Find your local Circuit Clerk’s website at: 
  
 
http://www.ilcourtclerks.org/illinois-court-clerks/. 
If the bank was served, make sure the 
 
Return/Affidavit of Service is filed with the Circuit 
Clerk. You may be responsible for filing this with 
the Circuit Clerk. The judge has no power to do 
  
anything if the Citation is not served. 
 
If you sent the Citation by certified mail, you must 
 
have the green receipt card to prove that the bank 
 
was served. Attach the green card to the original 
   
 
Citation and bring it to court. The clerk will put it 
  
into the court file. 
 
If the Return/Affidavit of Service says “no service,” 
this means that the sheriff's deputy tried to find the 
 
bank's agent, but could not serve the bank. If this 
 
happens, you must start over. The fee is less on 
  
the second attempt. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  NOTE: You should review the Return/Affidavit of 
 
 
 
 
Service. If it says the bank has moved or is not 
 
located at the address you wrote down, you should 
find a new address for the bank before starting 
  
again.

If you do not have access to a computer, or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your form. 
•	  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 
 
 

 

 

 

 

  
flash drive. 

•	  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

 
that you can use to e-file your form. 

o	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

  
Step 2: Serve the bank with a copy of your form. 
o	  The Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank 
 
 

must be served on the bank. The judge will have no 
 
 
power to order the bank to do anything if the Citation 
   
to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank is not served. 
o	  You can use the sheriff, a private process server, or 
 
 
 
Certified Mail to serve the bank with the Citation. 
  
You cannot give the Citation to the bank yourself. 
o	  The sheriff or the private process server will require 
 
  
 
the original Citation and 2 file-stamped copies. 
 
If by sheriff 
•	  Contact the sheriff's office in the county where 
 
the bank is located for more for information 
 
 
about how to serve the Citation on the bank. 
  
If the sheriff wants it in person:


 

 
Bring the file-stamped copies of your 
  
Citation to the sheriff's office. 
 
Pay the sheriff’s fees for the debtor OR give 
 
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver 
 
of Court Fees (if you have one) to not be 
  
charged a fee. 
 

 
If the sheriff wants you to mail it to the sheriff's 
  
office: 
 Mail copies of your Citation to the sheriff’s 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	 
 

 

 
office. 
 
Include the Letter to the Sheriff found at: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approve 
 
d/ 
 
Pay the sheriff’s fees for each party OR mail 
 
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver 
 
of Court Fees (if you have one) to not be 
 
charged a fee. 

 

 

o	 
 

 
If by private process server 
•	  You may also have the forms served by a 
 

 
 
private process server. A private process server 
is anyone 18 or older and not a party to the 
 
lawsuit. Private process servers do not accept 
  
fee waivers.

o	  Send a copy of the court’s order with the clerk’s 
 
 

 
filing stamp on it to the bank at the address shown 
on their answer. If the court orders the money to 
be turned over to you, you should send the bank a 
letter telling them where to send the money and 
  
include the order. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         

 

Step 5: Go to your court date. 
 
o	  Your court date, time, and room number are listed 
 
 
on your Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's 
 
Bank. 
 

 

o	  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 

•	  A copy of the Citation to Discover Assets to 
 

 

Debtor's Bank; 
 

•	  A copy of the written judgment (if you have one); 
 
 
•	  Any receipts you have of your court costs 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

including any costs for the sheriff; 
 

•	  The Return/Affidavit of Service showing that the 
 
 
Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank 
 
was served on the bank; AND 
 

 

 

 

 

•  Any answer you have received from the bank. 
 
 
 

o	  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
 
 
o	  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
 
 
form. If your form does not have a courtroom 
 
 
 
number, look for a list of cases at the courthouse or 
 
ask the Circuit Clerk. 
  

 

 

 

o	  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

 

o	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

name and case number to be called. 
 
 
If the bank was served but does not answer: 
•	  The judge may enter a conditional judgment 
 
 
 
against the bank for failure to answer. A 
 
 
conditional judgment requires the bank to file an 
 
answer on or before the next court date. The 
creditor must issue a Summons after 
 
Conditional Judgment and serve it on the bank 
 
sheriff or private process server. If the bank 
 
does not answer, the court may enter a final 
 
judgment against the bank for the balance due. 
  
•	  The judge may issue a Rule to Show Cause 
 
 
 
requiring the bank to appear and explain why 
 
they did not answer. If the bank fails to file an 
answer or appear for the Rule, the court may 
 
find them in contempt and may order their 
 
arrest. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	 
 

 

If the bank files an answer: 
  
•	 
 
 

 

 

 

If the bank's answer says that they have no 
 
property belonging to the debtor, then the 
 
Citation to Discover Assets to Debtor's Bank will 
be dismissed. 
  
If the bank answers that it has property 
 
belonging to the debtor, then you can seek a 
 
turn over order for this property. 
 
o	  The debtor has certain exemptions that protect 
 
 

   

•	 
 

income and assets belonging to the debtor such as 
 
social security, disability, or child support. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  Sometimes bank accounts are in the name of the 
 
debtor and another person. This will be shown on 
the bank’s answer. The other person, like a spouse 
or child, may actually own the funds. When this 
 
happens, you will need to continue the case and 
send a notice of hearing to the other party (unless 
 
they are already in court). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 6: After court, send a copy of any order entered to 
  
the bank's representative. 
o	 
 

If there are funds to be turned over, make sure you 
  
have your current address on the order.
