      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre> 

Information: gives the court the information 
needed to decide if you can change each child’s 
 
name. Complete one for each child. 
 
•	  Notice of Court Date Request for Name 
	 
	 
 
 

 

 

 

 

Change (Minor Children): tells any parents 
 
whose parental rights have not been terminated 
and any person who has physical custody of the 
 
 
children that you are asking to change the 
children’s names. (Do not use if you think 
 
publication would put the person whose name 
 
would be changed at risk. See "special note for 
 
 
victims" to the left.) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	  Order for Name Change (Minor Children): is 
	 
	 
 
 
used by the judge to approve or deny your 
 
Request for Name Change (Minor Children). 
Complete one for each child. 
 
 
your case 
 
	 
	 
•	  Request for Name Change - Additional 
 
 

o	  Other forms you may need depending on the facts in 
	 
	 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Children: use ONLY if you are trying to change 
 
the names of more than 4 children. If you are 
asking to change the names of more than 4 
children, give the court the children's current 
 
 
and proposed new names. 
 

 
•	  Request for Name Change - Additional 
	 
	 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Parent: use ONLY if there is more than one 
other parent or person who is not the parent 
with physical custody of the children. Do not 
include yourself. Tells the court each person's 
 
 
name and whether they agree with the name 
 
change. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	  Publication Notice of Court Date for Request 
	 
	 
 
 
for Name Change (Minor Children): use 
instead of Notice of Court Date Request for 
 
Name Change (Minor Children) ONLY if you do 
 
not know the location of the parents whose 
parental rights have not been terminated. Tells 
 
 
the public you are asking the court to change 
the children’s names and is published in a 
 
newspaper for 3 weeks. (Do not use if you think 
 
 
publication would put the person whose name 
would be changed at risk. See "special note for 
 
victims" to the left.) 
 
 

	 
	 
•	  Motion to Waive Notice & Publication: if you 
 
believe that notice or publication would put the 
 
person whose name would be changed at risk 
 
of physical harm or discrimination, use this 
 
INSTEAD OF the Notice of Court Date Request 
 
for Name Change (Minor Children) and 
 
 
Publication Notice of Court Date for Request for 
 
Name Change (Minor Children). 
 
	 
	 
•	  Order on Motion to Waive Notice & 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Publication: is used by the judge to say your 
 
 
Motion to Waive Notice & Publication is granted 
or denied. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Who can ask the court for a name change?
 

 

 
 
The person asking to change the children’s names MUST:
 

 

 
 
o	  Be at least 18 years old; AND 
	 
	 
 
 
 
o	  Have lived in Illinois for at least 6 months. 
	 
	 
 
 
The person asking to change children’s names MUST also 
have one of the following relationships with the children: 
 
o	  Be the parent with custody; 
	 
	 
 
 
o	  Be a guardian with legal custody; OR 
	 
	 
 
 
o	  The children have lived in your home for 3 years and 
	 
	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are recognized as your adopted children. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Special note for people who have orders allocating 
 
parental responsibilities:  
 
As of January 1, 2016, courts in Illinois no longer award 
child custody. Instead, the law requires the court to assign 
"parental responsibilities,” including significant decision 
making responsibilities and parenting time. If your divorce or 
family case was decided after January 1, 2016, most judges 
probably will only allow you to bring a name change request 
 
if you are a parent who has been given significant decision-
making responsibilities. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
You CANNOT change the name of a child if the child has 
 
been convicted of: 
	 
	 
o	  A felony and has not been pardoned or they finished 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
their sentence less than 10 years ago; OR 
 
 
Identity theft or aggravated identity theft and has not 
 
been pardoned; OR 

 

 

 

	 
	 
o	 
 

 

	 
	 
o	  Felony or misdemeanor: criminal sexual abuse when 
 
 
the victim at the time is under 18 years of age, sexual 
 
exploitation of a child, indecent solicitation of a child, 
indecent solicitation of an adult, or any other offense 
that requires the child to register as a sex offender and 
 
the child has not been pardoned. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Special note for victims of domestic violence, stalking, 
 
sexual assault, or discrimination: 
	 
	 
o	  You can ask the judge to change your children’s names 
 
 
without notifying the other parent or publishing the 
request in a newspaper. If you believe that giving the 
 
other parent notice or that publishing notice will put the 
 
 
person whose name would be changed at risk of 
physical harm or discrimination, you may file a Motion to 
 
Waive Notice & Publication. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

	 
	 
o	  You do not have to disclose your address if you or a 
 
 
 
 
member of your household are at risk of domestic 
 
violence, stalking, or sexual assault. You can use an 
  
alternative address on these forms. 

 

 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to change the children’s 
 
names? 
o	  Required forms 
	 
	 
 
 

 

 

Request for Name Change (Minor Children): 
 
gives the court the children’s current and proposed 
new names. A person who knows you must also 
sign the form as a witness.

o	 
	 
	 
 

 

If you do not have access to a computer, or if you 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your forms. 
  
	 
	 
•	  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 

  
a flash drive. 
 

	 
	 
•	  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 
that you can use to e-file your forms. 

 

 

 
 
Step 2: Ask for a court date. 
	 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
 
 
 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically. 
 
	 
o  If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
 

 

 

 

Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
 
with other court staff. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
o	  Ask the person who schedules the court date if you 
 
 
need to bring the children to your court date. 
 
o	  When you get your court date, complete the Notice 
	 
	 
 
of Court Date Request for Name Change (Minor 
 
 
Children) if you know the location of the parents 
 
whose parental rights have not been terminated. 
  
If you do not know the location of the parents whose 
parental rights have not been terminated, complete 
the Publication Notice of Court Date for Request for 
 
Name Change (Minor Children). 
 

   

	 
o	 
	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Do you know the location of the other parent whose 

 
 
parental rights have not been terminated? If yes, go 
 
to Step 3. If no, you must try to locate that person's 
 
 
address by searching on the Internet and calling 
 
friends or relatives. If you still cannot find their 
 
address, follow Step 4. 
 
You may ask the court to waive the notice or 

 
publication requirement if you believe that: 

 
o  giving notice to the other parent, OR 

	 
 
 
o  publishing notice 

 
 

 
would put the person whose name would be 
 
changed at risk of physical harm or discrimination. 
 
If this applies, to you skip Step 3 and Step 4 and 
follow Step 5. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 3: Give notice of the Request for Name Change 
 
(Minor Children). 
	 
 
 
o  You must give notice to the following people: 

 

	 
•	  The biological parent of the children, unless 
	 
 
 
 

 
there is a court order terminating the parent’s 
  
rights; 

 

 

	 
•	  A person who has legally adopted the children; 
	 
 
 
	 
•	  A person who was married to the biological 
	 
 
 

 

 

mother at the time of the children’s conception 
 
or birth; AND 

 

	 
•	  Anyone who has physical custody of the 
	 
 

 
children. 

	 
 
 
o  There are two ways to give notice: 

 

	 
•	  Certified Mail addressed to the person to be 
	 
 

 

served and request a return receipt (green 
 
card); OR 

 
     
notarized. 
 

 

 

of an official Illinois notary public. 
 

How do I get my forms notarized? 
 
o	  To get your forms notarized, you must sign them in front 
	 
	 
 
 
 
	 
	 
o	  You may often find a notary public at your local bank, 
 
 
 
county courthouse, or town/city hall. Some currency 
 
exchanges, real estate offices, and law firms offer this 
 
service. You may also find an independent notary public 
 
 
by searching online or the phone book yellow pages. 
	 
	 
o	  Call ahead to find out if the location has a notary public 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and if you need an appointment. 

 

	 
	 
o	  There may be a small fee for getting your form 
 
 

 

	 
	 
o	  You must bring your photo I.D. to the notary public. 
 
 

 

 

Your I.D. cannot be expired and must show your current 
 
address. 
  

 

 

 

o	 
	 
	 
 

What costs will I need to pay to file Request for Name 
 
Change (Minor Children)? 
 
	 
o	  There is a fee for filing a Request for Name Change 
	 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(Minor Children) with the Circuit Clerk. 
 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask the 
court to file for free. Fill out the Application for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees to ask the court for a fee waiver. This is a 
 
separate set of forms you can find at: 
 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What do I do after I fill out my forms?
 

 
 
 
Step 1: File the forms with the court where you live. 
 
o	  Find the courthouse in the county where you live: 
	 
	 
 
 

 

 

 

www.illinoiscourts.gov/circuitcourt/circuitmap/map1.asp 	
 

 

 

	 
o	  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
	 
 
 
unless you qualify for an exemption from e-filing. 
  
 
•	  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do not 

	 
	 
 
 
have internet or computer access at home and it 

 
would be difficult for you to travel to a place where 
 
you could use a computer, (2) you have a disability 
 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you have trouble 
reading or speaking in English. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	  Fill out a Certification for Exemption from E-Filing 
	 
	 
 

 
found here: 
www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default.asp. 

 

•	  File the original and 1 copy of your forms, and the 
	 
	 
 
Certification, with the clerk’s office in person or by 

 
mail. 
 

 

 

 

	 
o	  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
	 
 

  
provider. 
	 
•	  Visit http://efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service­
	 
 
 

 

providers.htm to select a service provider. Some 
service providers are free while others charge a 
  
processing fee.

•	  The number of copies of your Notice 
 
 
and forms to bring or send; AND 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
•	  The sheriff’s fees for service and if they 
 
 
will honor your Order for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees (if you have one). 
 

 
o	  Confirm the sheriff served your forms on the 
	 
	 
 
 
other parent or person who is not the parent 
  
with physical custody of the children. 
	 
	 
•	  After the sheriff serves the other parent or 
 
 
 
person who is not the parent with physical 
 
 
custody of the children with your court forms, 
 
they will fill out an Affidavit of Service and file 
 
it with the Circuit Clerk OR mail it to you. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
•	 
 

	 
	 
•	 
 

	 
	 
•	 
 

 

 
If the sheriff files the completed Affidavit of 
 
Service directly with the Circuit Clerk, call the 
 
 
Circuit Clerk to find out if it has been filed. If 
it has been filed, ask the Circuit Clerk how to 
 
get a copy. 

 

 

 
If the sheriff mails the completed Affidavit of 
Service to you, make a copy for yourself, file 
the original with the Circuit Clerk, and have 
 
the Clerk file stamp your copy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If the sheriff was not able to serve the other 
parent or person who is not the parent with 
 
physical custody of the children, ask them 
why. You should try to fix the problem and 
 
ask the sheriff to try to serve the other parent 
or person who is not the parent with physical 
 
 
custody of the children again. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 
Skip Step 4 and Step 5 and go to Step 6 if you have 
 
 
given notice to the other parent or person who is 
 
not the parent with physical custody of the children 
 
under Step 3. 
 
Step 4: Publish your Publication Notice of Court 
 
Date for Request for Name Change (Minor Children) 
 
in a newspaper in the county where you live once a 
  
week for 3 weeks in a row. 
	 
	 
o	  Contact an Illinois newspaper in your county and set 
 
 

	 
	 
o	 
 

 
up publication of the Notice. 
If there is no newspaper in your county, contact a 
 
convenient newspaper published in Illinois. 

 
	 
	 
o	  Give a copy of the Publication Notice of Court Date 
 
 
for Request for Name Change (Minor Children) to a 
 
newspaper. 
 

	 
	 
o	  The Notice must appear in a newspaper for the first 
 
 
 
time at least 6 weeks before your court date. 
	 
	 
o	  Newspapers may charge you a publication fee. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you have a fee waiver in your court case, the 
 
newspaper is not required to waive your fee for 
 
publication. You will need to file a Motion asking 
the court to order the county to pay the cost of 
 
publication. You can find the Motion form at: 
 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o	 
	 
	 
 

     

o	  How to give notice by USPS Certified Mail with return 
	 
	 
 

 

receipt (green card). 
 
	 
	 
•	  Mail a copy of your forms to each person who will 
 
 

 
get notice by USPS Certified Mail and return receipt 
 
requested (green card). 
 

 

 

 

	 
	 
•	  When you receive the return receipt (green 
 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
•	 
 

card) back, make a copy for yourself, file the original 
 
with the Circuit Clerk, and have the Clerk file stamp 
your copy. 
 
If the letter is returned to you as undeliverable, but 
 
you know the person’s location, you will need to 
serve your forms by service of process by sheriff. If 
 
you do not know the person’s location you should 
go to Step 4. 
 
	 
	 
o	  How to Serve by Sheriff 
 
 
  
o	  You have to put the court date on the Notice. 
	 
	 
 
 
 
o	  Staple a Notice to the front of the copy of your forms 
	 
	 
 
 
that will go to each person who will get notice. 
 
In person or by mail, ask the sheriff in the county 
 
where the person to be served lives to serve your 
 
 
Notice and your forms. 
 
 
In Person 
 
	 
	 
•	  Bring copies of your Notice and your forms to 
 
 
the sheriff’s office in the county where the 
 
person to be served lives. 
 

	 
	 
o	 
 

o	 
	 
	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
•	  Pay the sheriff’s fees for each Notice OR give 
 
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees (if you have one) to not be charged 
a fee. 
 
o	  By Mail 
	 
	 
 
 
•	  Mail copies of your Notice and your forms to the 
	 
	 
 
sheriff’s office in the county where the person to 
be served lives. 
 

 

 

 

o	 
	 
	 
 

•	 
	 
	 
 

•	 
	 
	 
 

 
Include the Letter to the Sheriff found at: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/ 
 

 

Include a self-addressed and stamped envelope 
for the sheriff to mail the Affidavit of Service to 
you. 
 

•	  Pay the sheriff’s fees for each Notice OR mail 
	 
	 
 
the sheriff a copy of your Order for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees (if you have one) to not be charged 
a fee. 

     

 

 

 

 

If the other parent or person who is not the parent 
 
with physical custody of the children does NOT live 
 
in the same county or state where the case was 
 
filed: 
 
	 
	 
•	  Get the name, address, and telephone number

o	  After the Notice appears in a newspaper for 3 weeks, 
	 
	 
 
 
get a Certificate of Publication from the newspaper. 
 
o	  Ask the newspaper how you will get the Certificate of 
	 
	 
 
 
 

 

 

 

Publication. The newspaper will either: 
 
 
	 
 
	 
•	  Send the Certificate directly to the Circuit
 
 
  

 
 
Clerk;
 
  

	 
	 
•	  Mail the Certificate to you; OR 
 
 
	 
	 
•	  Tell you to pick up the Certificate in person. 
 
 
	 
	 
o	  File the Certificate of Publication with the Circuit Clerk 
 
 

 

 

 

before your court date. 
  
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Skip Step 5 and go to Step 6 if you have given notice to 
 
the other parent or person with physical custody of the 
 
children under Step 3 or have published notice under 
 
Step 4. 
 
 
Step 5: Ask the court to excuse you from giving notice 
 
to the other parent and from publishing notice. 
	 
	 
o	  File the Motion to Waive Notice & Publication with the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
o	  Ask for a court date for your Motion to Waive Notice & 
 
 

 

 

 

 
Circuit Clerk. 

 
Publication. 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
o	  Get ready for your court date. You must convince the 
 
 
judge that notice or publication would put the person 
 
whose name would be changed at risk of physical harm 
 
 
or discrimination. You should gather and make copies of 
documents you want the judge to see. If you want the 
judge to hear from other people, those people will have 
 
to come to court and be witnesses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
	 
o	  Go to your court date. Bring your evidence and a 
 
 
 
completed Order on Motion to Waive Notice & 
 
Publication. 
 

 

 

Step 6: Get ready for your court date. 
  
o	  Decide and write down: 
	 
	 
 
 
	 
	 
•	  What you want to ask the judge to do for you; 
 
 
 
	 
	 
•	 
If there is a disagreement with another parent 
  
 
 
about changing the children’s names, decide and 
write down: 
 
	 
	 
•	  What you will say to the judge if asked to tell 
 
 

 
your side of the case; AND 
 

 
	 
	 
•	  Questions you have for witnesses, if there are 
 

 

 

 

 

any. 
 

 

 

 

	 
	 
o	  Gather and make copies of documents you want the 
 
judge to see. Bring the original for the judge and one 
copy for you and an additional copy for each of the 
 
people in the case. 
 
If you want the judge to hear from other people, those 
 
people will have to come to court and be witnesses (in 
most cases, you cannot bring in written statements of 
 
witnesses). 
 

	 
	 
o	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 7: Go to your court date to ask the court to change 
 
 
your children's names. 
 
o	  Bring the children with you to court, unless you have 
	 
	 
 

 

 

been told not to by court staff. 
 

	 
	 
o	  You should have received a court date and time from 
 
 

the Circuit Clerk when you filed your court forms. If you 
 
cannot find your court date and time, call the Circuit 
 
Clerk. 
 

 

o	  Bring these items with you to court: 
	 
	 
 
 

•	  Copies of all the documents you filed with the 
	 
	 
 

 

Circuit Clerk; 
 

•	  Children's birth certificates; 
	 
	 
 
 
•	  Photo I.D.; 
	 
	 
 
 
•	  Order for Name Change (Minor Children) for 
	 
	 
 
 

 

each child; AND 
 
 

	 
	 
•	  Any documents you want the judge to look at. 
 
 
 

o	  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
	 
	 
 
 
o	  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
	 
	 
 
 

o	 
	 
	 
 

 

form. 
  
If your forms do not have a courtroom number, look 
 
for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the 
Circuit Clerk. 

 

 

   

o	  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
	 
	 
 
 

name and case number to be called. 
 

o	  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 
	 
	 
 
 

 
 
introduce yourself and explain to the judge why you 
want to change the children’s names. 
  

 

 

 

 
If you believe that a parent will contest the 
 
 
children’s name change, you should be prepared to 
 
also follow Steps 8 & 9 
 
 
Step 8: Tell the judge your side of the case and 
  
answer questions. 
o	  Show your evidence including documents and 
	 
	 
 
 

   

 

 

 

photos. Give a copy to the judge. Be prepared to 
 
explain why the document or photo is important. 

 

 

o	  Question your witnesses. 
	 
	 
 
 

•	  Tell the judge the name of your witnesses. 
	 
	 
 
  
•	  Ask the witnesses questions you prepared in 
	 
	 
 

 

 

  
advance. 

•	  The judge and the people you notified of the 
	 
	 
 

 

 
court date can ask questions of your witnesses 
 
when you are done. 
o	  The judge decides whether the documents, photos, 
	 
	 
 
 
or witness testimony can be considered in making a 
   
decision about your case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 9: The other parent or person who is not the 
 
 
parent with physical custody of the children 
 
presents their case. 
o	  The other people you notified of the court date will 
	 
	 
 
 

 

 

 

 

also get to present their case by testifying, giving the 
  
judge evidence, and questioning witnesses. 
o	  You will get to see any documents and photos the 
	 
	 
 
other people you notified of the court date bring to 
 
court. If you do not think the judge should consider 
them in making a decision about your case, tell the 
 
judge why. 

 

 

 

 

o	  You may ask questions of the witnesses brought by 
	 
	 
 
 
  
the other people you notified of the court date. 
Write down your questions while they are speaking 
 
to the other people you notified of the court date or 
  
the judge.

Step 10: The judge makes a decision. 
 
	 
o 	 The decision is called a court order. 
 
  
	 
o	 
	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

If the judge needs more information to make a decision, 
 
the judge may set up another court date. Make sure you 
understand what information is needed and get it before 
the new court date. 
  
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge may 
 
let you know the decision later by mailing a court order 
 
 
or at another court date. 
   
If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
 
decide right then and fill out a court order. 
  
	 
•	  Get a file-stamped copy of the order. 
	 
 
 
 
If GRANTED, get certified copies of the Order from the 
Circuit Clerk. You need a certified copy of the Order to 
change the children's names on records like birth 
certificate, social security card, and a driver’s license. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

	 
o	  There may be a fee for the certified copies.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
