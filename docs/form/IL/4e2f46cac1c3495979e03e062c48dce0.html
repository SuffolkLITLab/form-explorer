INTRODUCTION TO CLEARING 
 
YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD 
 
 
This page is an overview of the process. For more detail 
 
on the process, read the rest of the packet. 
 
 
What are the options to clear my criminal record in 
 
Illinois? 
 
When you are arrested or charged with an offense, a 
criminal record is created, even if you are not found 
 
 
guilty. Your criminal records can be read by the public, 
 
including your family, friends, employers, trade 
organizations, banks, and credit agencies. To have your 
 
record erased or hidden you must file a Request to 
Expunge and/or Seal Criminal Records with the court 
 
and have a judge approve your Request. 
There are 3 ways to clear your criminal record: 
 
o Expungement: Erases arrests and court
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

   

supervisions from your criminal record so it is like
they never happened. Qualified Probations (see
definition on Page 16) are only sealed by the State
 
 
Police but are erased by the arresting agency.
Sealing: Hides your criminal record from most of the 
 
public. Law enforcement agencies can still see 
sealed records. Employers required by law to 
conduct background checks can see sealed felony 
convictions. They cannot see sealed misdemeanor 
 
convictions or cases not resulting in convictions 
 
  
unless the employer is a law enforcement agency. 
Executive Clemency: If you do not qualify for 
 
expungement or sealing, you can apply for a pardon 
 
from the Governor forgiving you for your criminal 
 
convictions. A pardon does not erase or hide your 
 
conviction on its own. If you get a pardon authorizing 
expungement, you can then apply to have your 
 
 
record expunged. To learn more about getting a 
pardon go to: https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-
information/applying-executive-clemency
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o

 
o

 

 
  
What if I have Cannabis Convictions on my Record? 
 
o If you have misdemeanor or class 4 felony
 
 

convictions related to cannabis, you may not need to
 
use these forms. You may be eligible for a Motion to
Vacate or fall under the automatic expungement
process for that cannabis conviction.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o You should speak with a lawyer about whether you
 
qualify for expungement relief under the Illinois
Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, 410 ILCS 705.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Is the expungement and sealing form right for me? 
 
DO NOT use the Request to Expunge & Impound and/or 
 
Seal Criminal Records form in the following cases: 
 
o Stolen Identity: If the person that was arrested was
 
 
not you but impersonated you to the police, do not
 
 
use this form. Instead file a request to have your
record corrected due to identity theft. You can get the
form to correct your record due to identity theft at:
 
illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/expungement-
due-criminal-identity-theft.

record expunged (erased) or sealed (hidden)?

form. 

 

  
 
 
o  Step 4: File the form to begin the process. 

 
Read the rest of this guide for information on each step. 

 

 

 

 

STEP 1: GET COPIES OF YOUR 
CRIMINAL RECORDS 
 
 
Why do I need copies of my criminal records? 
 
Criminal records list the offenses you were arrested for, 
 
the offenses you were charged with, and the outcome of 
 
the cases including any sentences you received. You 
need this information to find out if your offenses can be 
expunged (erased) or sealed (hidden) and to fill out the 
 
form. 
 
 
What are the different types of criminal records? 
 
o  Court Disposition: The final judgment or outcome in 
 
a court case. There are no court dispositions for 
 
 
arrests or charges that did not lead to a court case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Chicago RAP Sheet (Record of Arrests and 
 
Prosecutions): List of all arrests, charges, and court 
 
 
case outcomes that happened in Chicago. 
 
o  Illinois State Police Statewide Criminal History 
 
 

Transcript: List of most arrests and convictions that 
 
happened in Illinois. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How do I get copies of my criminal records? 
  
 
o  Get information from the Illinois State Police. 
 
You are allowed to access your entire criminal 
 
history information from the Illinois State Police. 
 
Although not required, it is the best available source 
 
for your statewide criminal record. Please note, there 
might be discrepancies or missing information. You 
 
 
can get a "Statewide Criminal History Transcript" in 
   
3 ways: 
 
•  Directly from the Illinois State Police: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Illinois State Police, Bureau of Identification 
 
260 North Chicago Street, Joliet, Illinois 60432 
 
(815) 740-5160 
 
 
state.il.us/crimhistory/chri.cfm 

 

•  Every law enforcement agency is allowed to 
 
 
provide you this information. Check with your 
 
 
local law enforcement agency to find out costs 
  
and times for fingerprinting. 

 

•  You can also go to any licensed LiveScan 
 
 

 
 
vendor to get your transcript. Find a LiveScan 
 
vendor at: 
 
idfpr.com/LicenseLookUp/fingerprintlist.asp 

 

 

 

 

 

What if I have been arrested, charged with an
 
offense, or convicted in more than one Illinois 
 
 
county? 
 
You will have a criminal record in each county. You will 
 
 
have to: 
 
 
o  Get your criminal records from each county; 
 
o  Review your criminal records from each county to 
 
find out if you qualify to expunge or seal each 
criminal record; 
 

 

 

o  Fill out expungement and/or sealing forms for your 
 
 

 

criminal records in each county; AND 
 

 

 

o  Pay filing fees in each county (except if you qualify 
 
 

 

 

for a fee waiver). 
 

 
If I need help completing my form, where can I go? 
 
 
o  Check with your local courthouse or law library, or 
 
 
search illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help/lshc-
directory for free or reduced cost help. You may also 
 
contact the State Appellate Defender: 
illinois.gov/osad/Expungement. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What costs will I need to pay to expunge (erase) or
 
seal (hide) my criminal record? 
 
o  Criminal Record Fees:  If you are seeking to 
 
 

 

 

expunge or seal cases that took place in Chicago, 
 
there is a fee to get a copy of your RAP (Record of 
 
Arrests and Prosecutions) sheet from the Chicago 
 
Police Department. There is also a fee to get your 
 
Statewide Criminal History Transcript from the 
 
Illinois State Police. 
 

 

o  Circuit Clerk Filing Fee: To file your expungement or 
 
 
 
sealing form (unless waived). In certain places, a 
certified disposition fee may be required. 
 

 

 

o  Illinois State Police Processing Fee: To process your 
 
 
expungement or sealing court order. The Circuit 
 
Clerk collects this fee with the filing fee. 
 

 

 

 

If you cannot afford the Circuit Clerk Filing Fee or the 
Illinois State Police Processing Fee, you can ask the 
court to waive them. You can ask the court to file for free 
or at a reduced cost by filing the Application for Waiver 
 
 
of Court Fees which you can find at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-forms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 
How long will it take before I know if my record will
 
be expunged or sealed? 
It may take a few months to find out if your record will be 
  
expunged or sealed because: 
 
o  The State’s Attorney, the Illinois State Police, and 
 
Arresting Agencies get 60 days from the day they 
 
receive your Request to object to it; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
to review your Request; AND 

 
 
o  Courts are busy and it may take a while for a judge 
 
o  Law enforcement agencies may take up to 60 days 
 
from the day they receive your expungement or 
 
sealing court order to clear your criminal record.

Once you find these on your criminal record, review the 
lists below to see if your offenses can be expunged 
 
and/or sealed. 
 
 
What do I need to know to choose between 
 
expungement and sealing? 
 
 
o  You cannot expunge (erase) any record that resulted 
 
in a conviction, unless the conviction was reversed, 
 
vacated, pardoned by the Governor, or approved for 
  
expungement by the Prisoner Review Board. 
 
o  If you have been convicted and none of the 

exceptions apply, you may still be able to seal (hide) 
 
your conviction, depending on the charge and how 
 
 
much time has passed. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What types of offenses CAN be expunged (erased)? 
 
The following types of arrests, charges, or sentences on 
your criminal record can be expunged: 
  
o  Arrests for misdemeanors and felonies that did not 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

result in a conviction. 
 

 

o  Convictions for misdemeanors and felonies only if: 
 
 
•  The conviction was reversed or vacated; OR 
 
 
•  You received a pardon from the Governor 
 
 

allowing expungement of all convictions on your 
 
record; OR 
 

 

•  As an Honorably Discharged Veteran, you have 
 
a Certificate of Eligibility for Expungement from 
the Prisoner Review Board allowing 
expungement of all convictions on your record; 
 
OR 
 

 

 

 

•  An eligible misdemeanor or class 4 cannabis 
 
 

conviction under the Illinois Cannabis Regulation 
and Tax Act, 410 ILCS 705. 
 
o  Sentences for court supervision only if: 
 
 

 

 

•  2 years have passed since you successfully 
 
 
finished your court supervision, except the 
offenses listed directly below; OR 
 

 

 

•  5 years have passed since you successfully 
 
 

 

finished your court supervision for: 
 
 Domestic Battery 
 
 
 Criminal Sexual Abuse (victim was 18 or 
 
 

older) 
 

 Operation of an Uninsured Motor Vehicle 
 
 
 Operation of a Motor Vehicle when 
 
Registration is Suspended for Non-
 
Insurance 
 

 

 Display of False Insurance Card 
 
 
•  Scrap Processors to Keep Records 
 
 
• 
 

 

 

 

If you are 25 or older, your Reckless Driving 
 
supervision occurred when you were under 25, 
 
and you have no other convictions. 
 
o  Sentences of Qualified Probation, only if 5 years 
 
 
have passed since you successfully finished your 
 
qualified probation. 
 
 

 

 

o  NOTE: For definitions of the sentences listed above, 
 
 

 
see page 16. 
 

o  Get information from the Circuit Clerk. Many 
 
 

 

 

 

 

court records are available online. Other counties, 
 
like Cook County, do not provide online access to 
criminal records. In this case, go to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s Office in the county where your case was 
 
filed. Ask the Circuit Clerk for copies of your court 
 
dispositions or use the public computer at the 
 
courthouse to look them up and print them out. 
 
There may be a fee to get copies of or print out your 
 
court dispositions, but you can look at them on the 
 
computer and write down the information for free. 
 
Find your Circuit Clerk's website at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/ 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Get information from the Chicago Police 
 
 

 
Department. Order a RAP sheet from the Chicago 
 
Police Department if you were arrested in Chicago. 
 
There may be a waiting period before you get your 
 
RAP sheet. There will be a fee. 
•  You must go to the Chicago Police Department 
 
 

 

 

 

 

to get your Chicago RAP sheet: 
 
Chicago Police Headquarters 
 
3510 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 
 
 
(312) 745-5508 
 

•  You should also request a copy of your Illinois 
 
 

 

State Police Statewide Criminal History 
 
Transcript.  The Chicago Police will provide your 
 
state record for no additional cost. 
 

 

 
STEP 2: REVIEW YOUR 
 
CRIMINAL RECORDS & PICK 
EXPUNGEMENT AND/OR 
SEALING 
 

 

State of Illinois 

      

  

 

 

To determine if you can expunge and/or seal your 
 
 
criminal records, complete the Case Worksheet 
 
on page 13 of this booklet.  Once you have 
completed your worksheet, you do not need to look at 
 
 
your court dispositions and RAP sheets to complete 
 
the Request form. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

                 

 

   

What do I look for on my criminal record? 
 
To figure out if the offenses on your criminal record can 
be expunged (erased) and/or sealed (hidden), you need 
to look at each item in your criminal record and find the: 
 
 
o  Arrest dates and the police department which 
 

 

 

 

 

arrested you. 
 

 

o  Charge: The type of offense you were charged with 
 
 
in court or arrested for and released without 
 
 
charging. 
 

 

 

o  Disposition: The outcome of the case, for example, 
 
 

guilty/not guilty.

did not lead to a conviction can be sealed at any time, 
except minor traffic offenses, unless you were released 
 
without being charged. Sealing hides your criminal 
 
record from most of the public. Law enforcement 
agencies can still see sealed records. Cases with the 
following sentences on your criminal record can be 
sealed if at least 3 years have passed since the 
 
successful completion of your last sentence:

and Community Protection Act, or Section 5-6-

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

 

  
that you can use to e-file your form. 
 
 
 
o  The Circuit Clerk will mail your Request with the 
 

 
Notice of Filing for Expungement and/or Sealing to 
 
each of the following: 
•  County State’s Attorney 
 
 
•  Arresting Agencies (police departments) 
 
 
•  Chief Legal Officers of the cities, towns and 
 

 

 
villages where you were arrested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
What if I have arrests and charges from different 
 
counties? 
 
If you have arrests, charges, or convictions that 
happened in more than one county, you must file 
 
separate requests for expungement or sealing in each 
 
county. A Request should only include arrests, charges, 
 
and convictions that happened in one county. You will 
 
have to pay filings fees in each county where you file a 
 
Request, unless they are waived in each county. 
 
 
 
What if I move before my expungement or sealing 
 
case is over? 
 
If you move before your case is over, immediately notify 
the Circuit Clerk of your new address.  If you do not tell 
 
 
the court your new address, you may not receive notices 
 
of court dates and copies of court orders. 
 
Can anyone keep me from getting my criminal 
 
record expunged (erased) or sealed (hidden)? 
The police departments and prosecutors that you listed 
 
on the Notice of Filing for Expungement and/or Sealing 
form get a chance to object to your Request to expunge 
or seal your criminal record. They have 60 days from the 
day they receive your Request to file a written objection 
 
with the court. If they object, it means they do not want 
 
your record to be expunged or sealed. If the agencies do 
not object during the 60 days, they cannot object at a 
 
later time. 
 
 
How will I know if someone objects to my Request 
 
for expungement or sealing? 
 
The Illinois State Police will mail you a copy of their 
 
objection, if any. An objection does not mean the court is 
 
denying your Request. The court will consider the 
objection when deciding if your criminal record will be 
  
expunged or sealed. 
 
 
 
Will I have a court date for my expungement or 
 
sealing case? 
You may need to go to court for a court date in front of a 
 
judge. Some counties schedule a court date right away, 
but others will only schedule a court date if one of the 
 
agencies you listed on the Notice of Filing for 
 
Expungement and/or Sealing form objects to your 
Request.

How to electronically file (E-file) 
 
 
o  If you are filing to expunge arrests only (when no 
court case is filed) you must e-file the Request to 
 
Expunge & Impound and/or Seal Criminal Records 
with the trial court unless (1) you are an inmate in a 
prison or jail and you do not have a lawyer, (2) you 
 
have a disability that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) 
  
you qualify for an exemption from e-filing. 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
  
available. 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

   

 

 

 
 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
 

 
 
o  In counties that accept e-filing for criminal matters 
(you can go to efile.illinoiscourts.gov/active-
courts.htm to see if your court accepts criminal e-
 
 
filings) you may e-file the Request to Expunge & 
Impound and/or Seal Criminal Records with the trial 
 
court by the filing deadline that applies to your case. 

 

 

 

 

 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 

  
provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
 
help/how-to-e-file/ 
 
o  If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
  
terminal to e-file your forms. 
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 

  
a flash drive.

your records from being erased or hidden;

If the judge approves your Request, a copy of the Order 
 
will be sent by the Circuit Clerk to the police departments 
 
and prosecutors that you listed on the Notice of Filing for 
 
Expungement and/or Sealing. These agencies have 60 
days from the time they receive a copy of the Order to 
expunge or seal your records. 
 
 
How will I know when my record has been expunged
 
or sealed? 
 
The Illinois State Police will send you a letter stating that 
 
they have expunged or sealed your records. Until you 
receive this letter from the Illinois State Police, your 
 
records have not yet been expunged or sealed. 
 
 
Can anyone find out about my criminal record once 
 
it has been expunged or sealed? 
 
Some agencies will be able to find out that you 
expunged a criminal record and see your sealed 
records: 
 
o  Law enforcement agencies including police 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

departments, prosecutors, correctional institutions, 
 
military, and court services and Department of Child 
 
 
and Family Services can see all sealed records, 
 
expunged pardoned convictions, and some five-
year-waiting-period expunged records for limited 
purposes. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Any employer required by law to conduct fingerprint 
 
 
background checks can see sealed felony conviction 
 
records. These employers include financial 
 
 
institutions, fire departments, private carrier 
 
companies, schools, park districts, health care 
 
organizations, and childcare organizations. 
 
o  An employer not listed above and members of the 
 
 
public can’t see expunged or sealed records or find 
out that you have had a record expunged or sealed. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
If my records are expunged or sealed, do I have to
tell employers or potential employers about it? 
 
No, you do not have to tell employers about expunged or 
 
 
sealed criminal records. 
 
o  On job applications you may answer “no” to the 
 
question, “have you ever been convicted” if your 
 
entire criminal record was expunged or sealed. 
NOTE: in Illinois, private employers with 15 or more 
employees are not allowed to ask if you have ever 
 
 
been convicted of a crime. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  If you applied for expungement or sealing and the 
 
court has not decided yet, if asked, you still have to 
 
report your criminal record to a potential employer 
 
after an interview or conditional offer of employment. 
 
o  In Illinois it is against the law for employers to ask if 
 
 
you have expunged or sealed any criminal records 
 
unless they are one of the agencies above 
authorized by law. 
 

 

 

 

 

o  If an employer finds out that you expunged or sealed 
 
 
any criminal records, they cannot use that against 
 
you or they will violate the Illinois Human Rights Act 
 
775 ILCS 5/1-101-10/104.

What if my criminal record does not qualify for
 
expungement or sealing and I cannot get a 
 
certificate from the Prisoner Review Board? 
 
You may be able to get one of the following certificates 
 
 
from the court to help you show that you are serious 
 
about getting a job or a professional license: 
 
 
o  Certificate of Good Conduct: This certificate may help 
 
you get a job. You may be able to get the certificate if 
 
it has been two years since you successfully 
 
completed your sentence.  You cannot get a 
Certificate of Good Conduct if you have been 
convicted of aggravated DUI, aggravated domestic 
 
battery, kidnapping or aggravated kidnapping, or an 
offense requiring registration under the sex offense 
registration act. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

o  Certificate of Relief from Disabilities: This certificate 
 
 
may help you obtain a work-related license from the 
State of Illinois.  You can get a Certificate of Relief 
 
from Disabilities at the time of sentencing, or any 
 
time after that.  You cannot get a Certificate of Relief 
 
from Disabilities if you have been convicted of 
 
aggravated DUI, aggravated domestic battery, 
 
kidnapping or aggravated kidnapping, or an offense 
 
requiring registration under the sex offense 
registration act. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

                                   

 

 
 
 
o  Charge: Enter all offenses you were charged with for 
 
each case number, for example “drug possession” 
  
and “possession of paraphernalia”. 

 

 

 
o Date of Arrest: Enter the date you were arrested that 
 
 
is listed on your court disposition or RAP sheet. 
 
o Outcome: enter the sentence you received for the 

 

 

 
offense. 

 
o Completion of Sentence: Enter the date your 
 

 
 
sentence ended successfully. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

What if I see an arrest on my criminal record but 
 
there is no charge, disposition or sentence listed? 
 
o  Not all arrests lead to charges, so there would not be 
 
a charge, disposition, or sentence listed on your 
 
record. All arrests without charges can be expunged if 
 
all the offenses on your entire record qualify. If not, 
 
then the arrests can be sealed. In the chart below, 
 
you only need to enter the Arresting Agency and Date 
of Arrest for arrests that did not result in charges. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Appendix: Case Worksheet 
 
 
Use this worksheet to get the information from your 
 
entire criminal record in one place. 
  
 
o  You can find all the information you need to fill in the 
 

 

 

 

worksheet on your court dispositions, RAP sheets, and 
information from the Illinois State Police Access and 
 
Review process. Below are some samples to help you 
locate the information you need. 
 

 

o  There are three tables on page 15 of this instruction 
 
 
booklet to help you determine if a sentence or 
 
disposition qualifies as a conviction for the purposes 
 
of expungement and sealing. 
  
 

How do I complete the Case Worksheet? 
 
Using the information on your court dispositions and any 
 
RAP sheets you have, fill in your Case Worksheet with

State of Illinois 

      

  

 

o  If you see the disposition for your offense on Table 2 
 
below, you were convicted of that offense but you 
have an exception that allows you to apply for

How do I know if I was “convicted” of an offense and

The disposition (outcome) of the offense on your record 
tells you if you were convicted or not. The tables below 
 
explain what the disposition codes or descriptions on your

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
