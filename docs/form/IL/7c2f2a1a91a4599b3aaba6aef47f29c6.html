      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Under amended Supreme Court Rule 213(j) (eff. January 1, 1996), “[t]he Supreme Court, by 
administrative  order,  may  approve  standard  forms  of  interrogatories  for  different  classes  of 
cases.” The committee comments to this rule state, “In an effort to avoid discovery disputes, the 
practitioner is encouraged to utilize interrogatories approved by the Supreme Court pursuant to 
paragraph (j) whenever possible.” The following interrogatories are hereby approved pursuant to 
that amended rule. A party may use one or more interrogatories which are part of a form set of 
interrogatories.  Any  such  interrogatory  so  used  shall  be  counted  as  one  interrogatory  in 
determining  the  total  number  of  interrogatories  propounded,  regardless  of  any  subparts  or 
multiple inquiries therein. A party may combine form interrogatories with other interrogatories, 
subject  to  applicable  limitations  as  to  number.  A  party  shall  avoid  propounding  a  form 
interrogatory which has no application to the case. 
  Counsel  should  note  other  provisions  of  amended  Rule  213  that  are  reflected  in  these 
standard interrogatories, and which are applicable to nonstandard interrogatories as well. As the 
committee comments to amended Rule 213(a) indicate, “[the] prior requirement that the written 
interrogatories be spaced so as to permit  the answering party to  answer  upon the interrogatory 
served upon him has been amended to eliminate the spacing requirement, primarily because of 
the practical and customary way in which interrogatories are answered.” Although the proponent 
of  interrogatories  may  still  use  spacing  between  his  or  her  interrogatories,  these  standard 
interrogatories do not. 
  Also, amended Rule 213(d) retains the requirement that “[w]ithin 28 days after service of the 
interrogatories upon the party to whom they are directed, the party shall serve a sworn answer or 
an objection to each interrogatory, with proof of service upon all other parties entitled to notice. 
***  The  answering  party  shall  set  forth  in  full  each  interrogatory  being  answered  immediately 
preceding  the  answer.”  (Emphasis  added.)  While  the  supreme  court  envisions  that  parties  will 
continue with the practice of creating a new document in response to interrogatories, and it is the 
duty of the respondent to interrogatories to attest to the truthfulness of his or her answers, these 
standard interrogatories include sample attestation clauses. 
Finally,  under  amended  Supreme  Court  Rule  213(i),  a  party  has  a  duty  to  seasonably 
 
supplement  or  amend  any  prior  answer  or  response  whenever  new  or  additional  information 
subsequently  becomes  known  to  that  party.  The  proponent  of  the  interrogatories  may  wish  to 
include a reminder of this duty in the interrogatories.
