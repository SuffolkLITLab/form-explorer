      <pre>HOW TO GET AN ORDER FOR SUPPORT 
 

NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
These instructions apply to: 
  
o  Divorces/Dissolution of civil unions that involve child 

   

 

 

 

 

 

support and/or maintenance (also known as 
 
alimony); 
 
 

o  Paternity cases that involve child support only; 
 
o  Allocation of parental responsibility (custody and 

 
 

 

visitation – no marriage) that involve child support 
 
 
only; AND 
 

o  Child support (if paternity and custody are not 

 

issues). 
 

These instructions assume that you filed one of these 
cases already or plan to do so. They do not provide 
instructions about filing one of these cases. 
 
 
NOTE: You may be able to get help with getting a child 
support order from the Illinois Department of Healthcare 
and Family Services. They can help with paternity 
testing, getting a support order, and enforcing the 
support order.  To apply visit: 
 
illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/parents/Pages/Apply.aspx If 
you cannot use a computer or do not have internet 
 
access, you may call 1-800-447-4278.  If you have a 
 
TTY device, you may call 1-800-526-5812. 
 
 
 
The Department does not help with maintenance. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What forms do I need to get a support order? 
 
In addition to the forms, you will need to file one of the 
 
cases listed above, you will need some or all of these 
forms: 
 
o  Order for Support: this is used by the judge to set 

 

the amount of support and how often it is to be paid; 
it can be used for cases that involve child support 
only, maintenance only, or cases that involve both. 
 

o  Support Information Sheet: this is used by the 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

Circuit Clerk to maintain records of contact and other 
 
information for parties in cases involving support. 
 
Income Withholding for Support: this is used to 
require the employer of the person ordered to pay 
support to withhold support payments from wages; 
after the support is withheld, it is sent to the State 
Disbursement Unit. This form cannot be used for 
 
maintenance only cases. 
 
o  Letter to Employer: this is used by you to send the 
Income Withholding for Support to the employer. 
 
 
mailing address you put on these forms is where 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share 
 
with anyone else and that you check every day. If 
 
you do not check your email every day, you may 
 

o  Note: The email address (if you have one) and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DV-CSI 127.2 
 
 

miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
 
documents from other parties. 
 

 

 

What information will help me fill out the forms? 
 
o  The social security numbers of you and the other 

 

 

parent (if available); 
 
•  NOTE: if you cannot provide the social security 
 

number of the person who will be paying 
support, the employer is not required to 
withhold. 
 

o  The names and birth dates of any children that will 

 

be covered by the Order for Support; 
 

 
o  Your name, address, telephone number, email, and 

 

 

fax number (if you have one); 
 
•  NOTE: if your contact information cannot be 
 
revealed due to domestic violence, use safe 
contact information (like that of a friend or 
relative) instead of your own. 
 

o  The name, address, telephone number, email, and 

 

 

fax number (if they have one) of the other parent; 
 

o  The name, address, and phone number of your 
 

 

 

employer; 
 

parent; 
 

o  The name, address, and phone number of the other 

 

 

o  The amount of child support to be paid (this will be 

 

on the Order for Support); 
 
 

o  The amount of maintenance to be paid (this will be 

 

 

 

on the Order for Support); 
 
 
o  The Remittance ID for the county in which the support 
 
 
order was entered (this is available on the instructions 
 
 
for completing the Income Withholding for Support); 
 
 
 
AND 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The number of your court case (this will be on the 

 

 

Order for Support). 
 

STEP 1: COMPLETE THE FORMS 
 
o  Order for Support: complete the parts of this form 

 

 

that you can before going to your court hearing. If 
 
you and the other parent have an agreement on 
 
support, add the terms of that agreement to the 
Order for Support.  Both you and the other parent 
 
must also initial each page of the Order if there is an 
agreement. 
 

 

 

 

o  Support Information Sheet: complete this form 
before going to your court hearing. File it with the 
Circuit Clerk if the judge orders support. If the judge 
does not order support, do not file it with the Circuit 
Clerk. 
 

 
STEP 2: PREPARING FOR THE COURT HEARING 
 
You will need to bring to court information that will help 
the judge decide how much the support will be. 
 
 
You can get help calculating the correct amount of child 
support. 
  
o  Use the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family 
 
Services online child support estimator located here: 
cscwebext.hfs.illinois.gov/CscWebEx/app/estimator? 
execution=e1s1.

STEP 6: FOLLOW-UP 
 
o  CHILD SUPPORT CASES AND CHILD SUPPORT 
AND MAINTENANCE CASES: if you have not 
received your first child support or child support and 
maintenance payment within 30 days after the date 
the employer received the Income Withholding for 
Support, you need to follow up. 
 
•  First, contact the employer to see whether they 
 
 
have started the withholding and they have sent 
the support to the State Disbursement Unit. If 
 
they have not, ask if they intend to do that and 
when. 
 
If they have, contact the State Disbursement Unit 
to see if they have received the payments from 
the employer and then sent them to you. 
 
If they have, make sure that they have your 
correct address. If they do, you will need to check 
with your local post office to see if there is a 
problem there. Although in most cases there will 
not be a problem.  If there is and you cannot 
resolve the problem easily by yourself, you will 
need to contact an attorney or the Division of 
 
Child Support Enforcement for help by calling: 1-
800-447-4278. 
 

 
• 

 
• 

 

 

 

o  MAINTENANCE ONLY CASES: if your former 

 

spouse does not pay the maintenance as ordered. 
 
You will need to go back to court and ask the judge 
to take action to force your former spouse to make 
 
the payments.  You can use the Motion forms fond 
online:  illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms 
 

 

 

 

 

o  Complete these forms for cases involving child 

 

 

support only or child support and maintenance. (Do 
 
not use for cases involving maintenance only): 
 
 
• 

Income Withholding for Support: complete 
this form only after you have a signed Order for 
 
Support. Do not file this form with the Circuit 
Clerk. To complete this form you will need: 
  
▪
 

 

The name, address, and phone number of 
 
the employer of the person paying support; 
 
The full name and social security number for 
the person paying support; 
  
Your full name; 
 
The full name and date of birth for all 
children covered by the Order; 
 

▪
 

▪
 
▪
 

▪ Remittance ID number (this can be found on 
 
the instructions to the Income Withholding 
for Support), the amount of support to be 
paid and how often it is to be paid; AND 
 
Your contact information— if this should not 
be public because of domestic violence, use 
alternate contact information. 
 

▪
 

 

 

 

•  Letter to Employer: complete this form after 
 
 

 

you have completed the Income Withholding for 
Support. 
 

 

 
STEP 5: SERVING THE INCOME WITHHOLDING FOR 
SUPPORT 
 
o  Option 1: Send the Letter to Employer along with a 
 
copy of the Order for Support and the Income 
Withholding for Support to the employer of the 
 
person who will be paying the support. 
  
•  Send this letter by certified mail with a return 
 
receipt. You will get back a green postcard 
telling you the date the letter was delivered to 
the employer. 
 

 

 

•  Keep this postcard in a safe place and the 
 

 

certified mail receipt in a safe place so that you 
have it in case it is necessary to show proof that 
 
the employer got the Income Withholding for 
 
Support. 
  

 

 

 

o  Option 2: If your case involves child support, contact 
the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family 
Services and apply for assistance in serving the 
Income Withholding for Support. 
 

•  Once your case is registered, the Department will 
 

 

 

 

make sure that the Income Withholding for 
 
Support is served on the employer. In addition, 
they will monitor your case and send a new 
 
Income Withholding for Support if the person 
paying child support changes employers. 
  
•  They can also help you to enforce the child 
 
support order in court if necessary and in 
collecting unpaid child support. To apply visit: 
illinois.gov/hfs/ChildSupport/parents/Pages/Apply 
.aspx If you cannot use a computer or do not 
have internet access, you may call 1-800-447-
4278.  If you have a TTY device, you may call 1-
800-526-5812.
