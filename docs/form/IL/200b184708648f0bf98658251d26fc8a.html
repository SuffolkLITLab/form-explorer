What costs will I need to pay to file an appeal? 
 
 
o  You must pay a $50 filing fee to the Clerk of the 
 
 
Appellate Court when you file the Docketing 
 
Statement (Civil). 
 

  
HOW TO COMPLETE THE DOCKETING STATEMENT (CIVIL) 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
All the Supreme Court Rules mentioned in these
 
instructions can be found at: 
 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/rules/supreme-court-rules. 
 
 
What is a Docketing Statement (Civil)? 
 
 
o  A Docketing Statement (Civil) is a brief overview of 
 
 
 
 
 
the case you are appealing.  It tells the appellate 
court and all the parties that you have taken the first 
 
 
 
steps to file your appeal. 
 
o  Every civil appeal MUST have a Docketing Statement 
 
 
 
(Civil).  The Docketing Statement (Civil) is required by 
 
Supreme Court Rule 312. 
   

o  If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
 
 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees (Appellate 
 
Court). This is a separate set of forms you can find at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms. 
 
 

When do I need to file the Docketing Statement 
(Civil)? 
 
o  The deadline to file the Docketing Statement (Civil) is 
 
 
14 days after you file the Notice of Appeal (Civil) 
 
 
unless Supreme Court Rule 307 applies. 
  

 
o  If Supreme Court Rule 307 applies, the deadline to 
 
file the Docketing Statement is 7 days after you file 
the Notice of Appeal (Civil). See the next section for 
 
 
information on Rule 307. 
 

 
 
    
 

 
 
 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Who can use the Docketing Statement (Civil)? 
 
o  If you filed the Notice of Appeal (Civil), you are the 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

appellant. 
  

 

 

 

o  The responding party is called the appellee. 
 
  
 
 
o  The appellant uses the Docketing Statement (Civil). 
 
 
 
 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to file the Docketing 
 
Statement (Civil)? 
 
o  Docketing Statement (Civil): This form tells the 
 
 
appellate court that you are appealing a trial court 
 
order or judgment. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  Request for Preparation of Record on Appeal: 
 
 
This form is used to ask the trial court clerk to 
 
prepare the court file for the appellate court. You 
 
must request the complete court file and give it to the 
appellate court. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Request for Report of Proceedings (Transcripts): 
 
 
This form is used to ask the court reporter to print a 
 
 
report of everything that was said in the trial court. If 
 
   
the court hearing or trial was not recorded, then you 
 
 
should use either a Bystander's Report or Agreed 
Statement of Facts form. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
 
 

address you put on the forms is where important legal 
 
documents will be sent to you. You should use an 
email account that you do not share with anyone else 
and that you check every day. If you do not check 
 
 
your email every day, you may miss important 
 
information and documents from other parties. 
 

 
   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 
How do I fill out the Docketing Statement (Civil)? 
 
 
 
The Court Caption. 
 
 
o  Fill out the form online or print it and fill it out by hand. 
 
 
 
 

 
If you fill it out by hand, you must print neatly. 
 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  The first page of the Docketing Statement (Civil), and 
 
 

the first page of all the papers you file with the 
appellate court, must include the court caption. The 
court caption includes the names of the parties and 
the courts involved in your appeal. 
 
  
 

o  In the first part of the caption, you must write in the 
 
 

appellate case number and the appellate district that 
 
will hear your appeal. 
 
o  The second part of the caption, on the left side, 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should look the same as the caption used in the trial 
 
 
court documents, except you must check the box to 
 
identify which party is the appellant and which party is 
 
 
 
 
the appellee. 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Because the Docketing Statement (Civil) is a brief 
 
 
overview for the appellate court, you must write the 
following information on the right side of the court 
 
caption: 
  
•  the name of the county where the trial court made 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
the order or judgment; 
 
 
•  the trial court case number; 
 
  
 
•  the name of the trial judge; 
  
 
 
•  the date you filed the Notice of Appeal (Civil); 
 
  
•  the date of the order or judgment that you are 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
appealing; 
  

•  the date the trial judge issued an order on any 
 
 
post-judgment motion that was filed, such as a 
 
Motion to Reconsider; AND

•  the Supreme Court Rule that grants the appellate 
 

 
court jurisdiction (more about these rules is 
 
 
explained in the next section). 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

o  What is the Supreme Court Rule that grants the 
 

 
 
appellate court jurisdiction? 
•  "Jurisdiction" is the court's power to hear and 
 
 

 
 
decide your case. The appellate court cannot hear 
 
and decide your case unless it has jurisdiction. 
 
Your Docketing Statement (Civil) must tell the 
appellate court why you think it has jurisdiction to 
 
 
hear and decide your case, or else they may not 
 
allow your appeal to proceed. Supreme Court 
 
Rules 301 through 308 explain when the appellate 
 
court can hear an appeal and also provide the 
 
 
deadline for filing your Docketing Statement 
(Civil).  The most common rules used to give the 
 
 
appellate court jurisdiction are: 

   
 
 

 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Supreme Court Rule 301 – This rule gives the 
 

   

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
   

appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an 
 
appeal from a final judgment in a civil case. A final 
 
judgment is a judgment by the trial court that 
 
decides all issues in the civil case and that 
 
 
completely ends the case. If the trial court has 
 
entered a final judgment in your case, then you can 
appeal the case as long as you do so within the 
deadline. 

 
   

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 
 

•  Supreme Court Rule 304(a) – This rule gives the 
 
appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an 
 
 
appeal from a judgment that is final for some (but 
 
not all) of the parties or claims. In order for Rule 
304(a) to grant the appellate court jurisdiction, the 
 
trial court must say in the judgment that “there is no 
 
just reason for delaying enforcement or appeal or 
 
both” (this is called a “special finding”). If the trial 
court has entered a judgment that is final for some 
 
 
(but not all) of the parties or claims, and the trial 
 
court has also included a special finding in that 
 
judgment, then you can appeal that judgment as 
 
long as you do so within the deadline. 

 
 
   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

•  Supreme Court Rule 304(b) – This rule gives the 
 
appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an 
appeal from certain special types of orders (such 
 
as child custody or allocation of parental 
 
 
responsibilities orders, guardianship orders, 
 
contempt orders, and garnishment orders). These 
special types of orders may be appealed without a 
 
 
special finding by the trial court. If the trial court has 
 
entered one of the special types of orders included 
 
in Rule 304(b), then you can appeal that order as 
long as you do so within the deadline. 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Supreme Court Rule 307 – This rule gives the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an 
 
appeal of another group of special types of orders 
even before a final judgment has been entered in 
 
the case. The special types of orders covered by 
 
Rule 307 include temporary restraining orders, 
 
 
 
injunctions, and eminent domain orders. If the trial 
 
 
court has entered one of the special types of orders 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
included in Rule 307, then you can appeal that 
order as long as you do so within the deadline. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

The Sections of the Docketing
 
Statement (Civil): 
 
 
Section 1: 
 
o  Check the "yes" box if your appeal is related to 
 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
another appeal. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  A "Cross Appeal" allows the appellee to respond to 
 
 
the appellant’s appeal while also pursuing the 
 
appellee’s own appeal against the appellant.  The 
  
 
appellee (now also the “cross appellant”) can then 
attack an order or part of an order that gave relief to 
 
 
the appellant.  For example, if a landlord obtains an 
  
eviction order against a tenant but the court refuses 
 
 
to award him past-due rent, the tenant can appeal the 
 
 
 
eviction order and the landlord can cross appeal the 
 
denial of rent. 
 
 

   
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  A "Separate Appeal" allows a second appellant to 
 
  

 
appeal without joining the first appellant’s appeal.  By 
 
appealing separately, the second appellant can 
continue against different appellees or attack different 
 
 
orders than those included in the first appellant’s 
 
Notice of Appeal (Civil). For example, if two 
 
 
roommates are evicted and one roommate has 
 
appealed only the eviction order, the other roommate 
 
can separately appeal and then can also attack the 
 
order awarding past-due rent. 
 

 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

o  "Joining of a Prior Appeal" allows a second appellant 
 
 
 
to add their name to the first appellant’s Notice of 
 
Appeal (Civil).  The two appellants then continue 
 
together 
 
 

o  against the appellee.  For example, if two roommates 
 
 
 
are evicted and one roommate has appealed the 
eviction order, the other roommate can join as the 
 
second appellant. 
 
 
 

o  If there is no other related appeal, put a check in the 
 

   
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

box next to “No” in Section 1. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2: 
 
o  If you or any other party to the appeal is a corporation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or association, you must identify the names of any 
 
 
related companies, such as affiliates, subsidiaries, or 
 
 
 
parent groups.  To find this information, you can 
 
 
search the company name on the Internet using the 
following websites: Illinois Secretary of State at 
 
 
ilsos.gov/corporatellc/, and D&B Hoover’s at 
 
 
dnb.com/business-directory.html. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Section 3: 
  
o  Fill out your full name and complete address, 
 
 
 
 
 
 

telephone number, and email address in this section. 
  
If you are represented by a lawyer, you must enter 
 
   
their contact information and Lawyer Registration 
Number in the section for “Lawyer on Appeal for 
 
 
appellant.”

example, your spouse), attach an Additional 
 
Appellant Information form and include the full name, 
 
 
address, telephone number, and email address for 
 
each additional person filing the appeal.  If any of the

Section 5: 
o  You must enter the name, address, telephone 
 
 

 
number, and email address of the court reporter who 
 
recorded the hearing or trial that you are appealing. 
 
   
o  You need to know the dates of the hearing or trial that 
 
 
 
 
you are appealing because you must ask the court 
 
reporter to prepare a transcript of the hearing or trial 
 
 
for your appeal. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  To get this information, you can call the Court 
 
 

 
Administration Office of the Circuit Court where your 
 
 
hearing or trial happened.  If the hearing was 
    
 
recorded electronically, the Court Administration 
 
 
Office will be able to tell you how to request a 
 
transcript of the recording. 

    

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  If there is more than one court reporter, you must 
 
 
attach an Additional Court Report Reporter 
 
 
Information form and include the full name, address, 
 
 
 
telephone number, and email address for each court 
 
reporter. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

  
Section 6: 
o  If your appeal involves an order about child custody, 
 
 
 
 
allocation of parental responsibilities, adoption, 
 
termination of parental rights, or other matters 
 
 
involving the best interests of a child, put a check in 
 
the box next to “Yes.” 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  There are special rules that apply to appeals involving 
 
 
the best interests of children that you must read and 
follow. 

 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
 

o  The child custody or allocation of parental 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
 

responsibilities appeal rule is Supreme Court Rule 
311.  Also, each appellate court has its own local 
rules governing child custody or allocation of parental 
 
responsibilities appeals that you must read.  You can 
 
find the local rules at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/appellate-court/appellate-
court-local-rules/. 
 

 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  
Section 7:

You should include how and why you disagree with 
 
 
the trial court’s order or judgment. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
Section 8:

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, bring your form to the trial court 
clerk's office or appellate court clerk's office where 
 
you can use a public computer terminal to e-file your 
  
form. 
•  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

 
that you can use to e-file your form. 

 

 

                                                                                         

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

system. If you or the person you’re sending the 
Docketing Statement (Civil) to does not have an 
 
 
email address, you may give it to the other parties by 
 
 
 
personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
 
 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 
  
 
 
o  Complete the Proof of Service with information to 
 
 
show how you sent your Docketing Statement (Civil) 
 
 
to each party.  The Proof of Service has room for 3 
 
 
parties. If you are sending your Docketing Statement 
 
(Civil) to more than 3 parties, fill out and insert one or 
 
 
more Additional Proof of Service forms into the

the section titled “What is the Supreme Court Rule 
 
that grants the appellate court jurisdiction?” 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 
 
 

o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
 
available.

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 
 
If you are not e-filing, contact the appellate court 
 
 
clerk’s office and ask how many copies of your 
 
Docketing Statement you must provide.  Then 
deliver your original Docketing Statement, the 
 
required number of copies, and the Certification 
 
to the clerk’s office in person, by mail, or by 
 
third- party commercial carrier (e.g., FedEx or 
 
 
 
 
UPS).

provider. 
  
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
to select a service provider. Some providers are 
free, while others charge a processing fee. For 
 
instructions on how to e-file for free with

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
