"Jurisdiction. " is the court's power to hear and . decide your case. The appellate court cannot hear . and decide your case unless it has jurisdiction. . Your . Docketing Statement (Civil) . must tell the . appellate court why you think it has jurisdiction to . hear and decide your case, or else they may not . . allow your appeal to proceed. Supreme Court . . Rules 301 through 308 explain when the appellate . court can hear an appeal and also provide the . deadline for filing y. our . Docketing Statement . (Civil) . . The most common rules used to give the . appellate court jurisdiction are: . Supreme Court Rule 301 . Œ This rule gives the . appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an . appeal from a final judgment in a civil case. A final . judgment is a judgment by the trial court that . . decides all issues in the civil case and that . completely ends the case. If the trial court has . entered a final judgment in your case, then you can . . appeal the case as long as you do so within the . . deadline. . Supreme Court Rule 304 (a) . Œ This rule gives the . appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an . appeal from a judgment that is final for some (but . not all) of the parties or claims. In order for . Rule . 304 (a) to grant the appellate court jurisdiction, the . trial court must say in the judgment that ﬁthere is no . just reason for delaying enforcement or appeal or . bothﬂ (this is called a ﬁspecial findingﬂ) . . If the trial . court has entered a judgment that is final for some . . (but not all) of the parties or claims, and the trial . . court has also included a special finding in that . judgment, then you can appeal that judgment as . long as you do so within the deadline. . Supreme Court Rule 304 (b) . Œ This rule gives the . appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an . . appeal from certain special types of orders (such . . as child custody or allocation of parental . responsibilities . orders, guardianship orders, . contempt orders, and garnishment orders) . Thes. e special types of orders may be appealed without a . special finding by the trial court. If the trial court has . entered one of the special types of orders included . in Rule 304 (b) , then you can appeal that order as . . long as you do so within the deadline. . Supr. eme Court Rule 307 . Œ This rule gives the . appellate court jurisdiction to hear and decide an . . appeal of another group of special types of orders . even before a final judgment has been entered in . the case. The special types of orders covered by . Rule 307 include temporary restraining orders, . injunctions, and eminent domain orders. . If the trial . court has entered one of the special types of orders . included in Rule 307, then you can appeal that . order as long as you do so within the deadline. . The Sections of the Doc. keting . Statement (Civil) : . Section 1. : o Check the . "yes" . box . if your appeal is related to . another appeal. . o A "Cross Appeal" allows the appellee to respond to . . th. e appellant™s appeal while also pursuing the . appellee™s own appeal against the appellant. . The . appellee (now also the ﬁcross appellantﬂ) . can then . attack an order or part of an order that gave relief to . the appellant. For example, if a landlord obtains an . eviction order against a tenant but the court refuses . to aw. ard him past. -due rent, the tenant can appeal the . eviction order and the landlord can cross appeal the . denial of rent. . o A "Separate Appeal. " allows a second appellant to . appeal without joining the first appellant™s appeal. . By appealing separately, the second appellant can . . continue . against different appellees or attack different . orders than those included in the first appellant™s . Notice . of Appeal. . For example, if two roommates are . evicted and one roommate has appealed only the . eviction order, the other . roommate can separately . appeal and then can also attack the order awarding . . past. -due rent. . o "Joining of a Prior Appeal. " allows a second appellant . to add their name to the first appellant™s . Notice of . Appeal. . The two appellants then . continue together . o against . the appellee. For example, if two roommates . are evicted and one roommate has appealed the . . eviction order, the other roommate can join as the . . second appellant. . o If there is no other related appeal, put a check in the . box next to ﬁNoﬂ in . Section . 1. Section 2. : o If you or any other party to the appeal is a corporation . . or association, you must identify the names of any . related companies, such as affiliates, subsidiaries, or . . parent groups. To find this information, you . can . search the company name on the Internet using the . . following . websites: Illinois Secretary of State at . ilsos. gov/corporatellc/. , and D&B . Hoover™s . at . dnb. com/business. -directory. html. . Section 3. : o Fill out your full name and complete address, . . telephone number, and email address in this section. . . If you are represented by a . lawyer. , you must enter . their contact information and Lawyer Registration . .
