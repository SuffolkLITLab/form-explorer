Pursuant to . 750 ILCS 28/20 (c) (7) . duties of the payor and the fines and penalties for. failure to withhold and pay over income and for discharging, disciplining, refusing to hire, or. . otherwise penalizing the obligor because of the duty to withhold and pay over income . as follows: . 750 ILCS 28/20 (g) . -The obligee or public office may serve the income withholding . notice on the payor or its superintendent, manager, or other agent by ordinary mail or. certified mail return receipt requested, by facsimile transmission or other electronic means, . by personal delivery, or by any method provided by law for service of a summons. At the time . . of service on the payor and as notice that withholding has commenced, the obligee or . public. office shall serve a copy of the income withholding notice on the obligor by ordinary mail. . addressed to his or her last known address. A copy of an income withholding notice and . . proof of service shall be filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court only when necessary in . connection with a petition to contest, modify, suspend, terminate, or correct an income . withholding notice, an action to enforce income withholding against a payor, or the resolution . of other disputes involving an income withholding notice. The changes made to this . subsection by this amendatory Act of the 96 th General Assembly apply on and after . September 1, 2009. . 750 ILCS 28/20 (i) . New service of an income withholding notice is not required in order. to resume withholding of income in the case of an obligor with respect to whom an income. withholding notice was previously served on the payor if withholding of income was . . terminated because of an interruption in the obligor's employment of less than 180 days. . 750 ILCS 28/35 (a) . It shall be the duty of any payor who has been served with an income . withholding notice to deduct and pay over income as provided in this Section. The payor shall . . deduct the amount designated in the income withholding notice, as supplemented by any. . notice provided pursuant to subsection (f) of Section 45, beginning no later than the next. . payment of income which is payable or creditable to the obligor that occurs 14 days following. the date the income withholding notice was mailed, sent by facsimile or other electronic . means, or placed for personal delivery to or service on the payor. The payor may combine all. . amo. unts withheld for the benefit of an obligee or public office into a single payment and. . transmit the payment with a listing of obligors from whom withholding has been effected. The. . payor shall pay the amount withheld to the State Disbursement Unit within 7 business days. . after the date the amount would (but for the duty to withhold income) have been paid or. credited to the obligor. If the payor knowingly fails to withhold the amount designated in the. income withholding notice or to pay any amount withheld to the State Disbursement Unit. . within 7 business days after the date the amount would have been paid or credited to the. . obligor, then the payor shall pay a penalty of $100 for each day that the amount designated. . in the income withholding notice (whether or not withheld by the payor) is not paid to the . 7/1/2017. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The total penalty for. . a payorâ„¢s failure, on one occasion, to withhold or pay to the State Disbursement Unit an . amount designated in the income withholding notice may not exceed $10, 000. 00. . The failure. of a payor, on more than one occasion, to pay amounts withheld to the State Disbursement. Unit within 7 business days after the date the amount would have been paid or credited to the . . obligor creates a presumption that the payor knowingly failed to pay over the amounts. This. penalty may be collected in a civil action, which may be brought against the payor in favor of. . the obligee or public office. A finding of a payor's nonperformance within th. e time required . under this Act must be documented by a certified mail return receipt or a sheriff's or private . process server's proof of service showing the date the income withholding notice was served. . on the payor. For purposes of this Act, a withheld amount shall be considered paid by a payor. . on the date it is mailed by the payor, or on the date an electronic funds transfer of the amount. has been initiated by the payor, or on the date delivery of the amount has been initiated by. the payor. For each deduction, the payor shall provide the State Disbursement Unit, at the. time of transmittal, with the date the amount would (but for the duty to withhold income) have. . been paid or credited to the obligor. . After June 30, 2000, every payor that has 250 or more employees shall use electronic. funds transfer to pay all amounts withheld under this Section. During the year 2001 and. during each year thereafter, every payor that has fewer than 250 employees and that withheld . income under this Section pursuant to 10 or more income withholding notices during . . December of the preceding year shall use electronic funds transfer to pay all amounts. . withheld under this Section. . For withholding of income, the payor shall be entitled to receive a fee not to exceed $5 . per month to be taken from the income to be paid to the obligor. . 750 ILCS 28/35 (b) . Whenever the obligor is no longer receiving income from the payor, . the payor shall return a copy of the income withholding notice to the obligee or public office. . and shall provide information for the purpose of enforcing this Act. . 750 ILCS 28/35 (c) . Withholding of income under this Act shall be made without regard. to any prior or subsequent garnishments, attachments, wage assignments, or any other. claims of creditors. Withholding of income under this Act shall not be in excess of the. maximum amounts permitted under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act. Income . available for withholding shall be applied first to the current support obligation, then to any. premium required for employer, labor union, or trade union. -related health insurance . coverage . ordered under the order for support, and then to payments required on past. -duesupport obligations. If there is insufficient available income remaining to pay the full amount. of the required health insurance premium after withholding of income for the current support. . obligation, then the remaining available income shall be applied to payments required on. . past due support obligations. If the payor has been served with more than one income. withholding notice pertaining to the same obligor, the payor shall allocate income available. for withholding on a proportionate share basis, giving priority to current support payments. . . A payor who complies with an income withholding notice that is regular on its face shall not. . be subject to civil liability with respect to any individual, any agency, or any creditor of the. . obligor for conduct in compliance with the notice. . 750 ILCS 28/35 (d) .

The obligee or public office shall provide notice to the payor and . Clerk of the Circuit Court of any other support payment made, including but not limited to, a . set off under federal and State law or partial payment of the delinquency or arrearage, or both. . 750 ILCS 28/45 (j) . If an obligee who is receiving income withholding payments under. this Act does not receive a payment required under the income withholding notice, he or she. must give written notice of the non. -receipt to the payor. The notice must include the date on. . which the obligee believes the payment was to have been made and the amount of the . payment. The obligee must send the notice to the payor by certified mail, return receipt. requested. . After receiving a written notice of non. -receipt of payment under this subsection, a . payor must, within 14 days thereafter, either (i) notify the obligee of the reason for the non. -. receipt of payment or (ii) make the required payment, together with interest at the rate of 9%. calculated from the date on which the payment of income should have been made. A payor. who fails to comply with this subsection is subject to the $100 per day penalty provided under. subsection (a) of Section 35 of this Act. . 750 ILCS 28/50 (a) . Where a payor willfully fails to withhold or pay over income pursuant. to a properly served income withholding notice, or willfully discharges, disciplines, refu. ses . to hire or otherwise penalizes an obligor as prohibited by Section 40, or otherwise fails to. comply with any duties imposed by this Act, the obligee, public office or obligor, as. . appropriate, may file a complaint with the court against the payor. The Clerk of the Circuit. . Court shall notify the obligee or public office, as appropriate, and the obligor and payor of. . the time and place of the hearing on the complaint. The court shall resolve any factual dispute . including, but not limited to, a denial that the payor is paying or has paid income to the. obligor. Upon a finding in favor of the complaining party, the court: . (1) . shall enter judgment and direct the enforcement thereof for the total amount that. the payor willfully failed to withhold or pay over; an. d (2) . may order employment or reinstatement of or restitution to the obligor, or both, . where the obligor has been discharged, disciplined, denied employment or otherwise . . penalized by the payor and may impose a fine upon the payor not to exceed $200. . 750 ILCS 28/50 (b) . Any obligee, public office or obligor who willfully initiates a false. proceeding under this Act or who willfully fails to comply with the requirements of this Ac. t shall be punished as in cases of contempt of court. . 750 ILCS 28/50 (c) . Any officer or employee of any payor subject to the provisions of. this Act who has the control, supervision, or responsibility for withholding and paying over. . income pursuant to an income withholding notice properly served on the payor and who . . willfully fails to withhold or pay over income as required under the income withholding notice . shall be personally liable for a penalty equal to the total amount that was not withheld or paid. over by the payor. Only where the employer has incurred sums due under this Section and is. unable to pay such amounts may personal liability attach to a responsible officer or em. ployee. who has willfully failed to withhold and pay over income as required under the income. . withholding notice. The personal liability imposed by this subsection shall survive the. . dissolution of a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation. For the purposes of. this subsection, "officer or employee of any payor" includes a partner of a partnership, a. manager or member of a limited liability corporation, and a member of a registered limited . liability partnership. . 7/1/2017. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The fine shall be payable to the Department of. Healthcare and Family Services and may be used to defray the costs incurred by the. . Department in the collection of the past. -due support and penalties provided for in this Act. . The Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall place the fines collected into a. . special fund created to implement the purposes of this Section and the fines shall be utilized. for the purposes provided for in this Section.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields and Utilization:<sup>*</sup></h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
      </p>
      
      <p style="background:#fcf19d"><sup>*</sup><i> With historical form data we could provde insights on field utilization  
      (e.g., <b>X%</b> of the time this field is left blank...). 
       If you work with the court and can help provide historic form data, <a href="mailto:litlab@suffolk.edu">let us know</a>.
