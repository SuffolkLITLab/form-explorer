General Application Instructions 
The following are general application instructions that apply to all employment/ 
 
promotional  applicants. See next page for  specific instructions. 

 

 

 

 

 

A. Send  a  copy  of  the  completed  application  to  the  Probation  Division  at  the 
address  at  the  top  of  the  form.  A  copy  must  also  be  sent  to  the  Chief 
 
Judge’s  Office  of  the  judicial  circuit(s) to which you are applying. 

 

 

 

 

 

B. 

C. 

D. 

 

 

 

The  role  of  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Illinois  Courts  (AOIC) 
Probation  Division  in  the  hiring  and  promotion  of  probation/court 
services personnel is limited to certifying the eligibility of the applicant 
in terms of the minimum qualifications stated in Part1, A and B, above. 
Circuit  court  and/or  probation/court  services  department  hiring 
policies and procedures control the actual selection process and may be 
 
more restrictive than the minimum State requirements. Applicants are 
 
advised to inquire about and comply with circuit and/or departmental 
policies and procedures. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that the proper  copy 
of  the  Employment/Promotion  Application  form,  along  with  his/her 
final certified official college transcript(s), is forwarded simultaneously 
 
to  both  the AOIC  Probation  Division  and  to  the Chief  Judge(s)  of  the 
appropriate circuit(s). Probation departments are under no obligation 
 
to  consider  applicants  who  do  not  submit  application(s)  to  the 
appropriate Chief Judge(s) offices(s). It is highly recommended that the 
applicant also forwards a current resume to the Chief Judge(s). 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
An  applicant  may  apply  to  more  than  one  judicial  circuit.  If  the 
applicant does wish to apply to more than one circuit, he/she must send 
 
a copy of the Employment/Promotional Application form to the Chief 
Judge’s Office of each circuit of preference. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E.  Upon establishing an applicant’s qualifications, the Probation Division 

 

will send a letter of certification to the applicant, and the applicant’s 
name will be placed on a list of eligibles. This certification of the 
 
applicant’s eligibility completes the AOIC Probation Division’s 
responsibility regarding the application. The fact that the applicant is 
eligible does not mean that he/she will be granted an interview or be 
offered a position by the judicial circuit(s) he/she hasspecified. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

F. 

 

 

An applicant will remain on the statewide eligibles list for one year, 
unless otherwise removed. An applicant can request, in writing to the 
AOIC Probation Division, a one year extension on a circuit(s) eligibles 
 
list(s), for a maximum of two years on the list(s) without having to 
reapply. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

Pursuant to the provisions of 730 ILCS 110/15, all applicants must be certified by
 
the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts (AOIC) Probation Division as meeting
the minimum qualifications for probation/court services personnel as defined in 
the Policies Governing Hiring, Promotion and Training of Illinois Probation Court
 
Services  Personnel  in  order  to  be  eligible  for  employment  or  promotion  by 
probation  and  court  services  departments  in  Illinois.  Upon  their  eligibility  being
certified, applicants will be notified in writing that they are eligible for employment 
 
or promotion, subject  to circuit court or departmental application  requirements
 
and selection criteria, which may exceed minimum state qualifications. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Employees  who  leave  and  later  return  to  employment  with  probation/court 
 
services need not to re-apply unless the period between leaving and returning to 
 
employment exceeds two years.
