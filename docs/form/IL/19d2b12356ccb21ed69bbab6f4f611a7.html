ARE YOU THE DEFENDANT? SEE BELOW 

 

 

AN EVICTION CASE HAS BEEN FILED 
 

 

 

 

 

The Plaintiff is trying to evict you. If you lose this case, you will have to move and possibly pay the Plaintiff money. Get to court on 
 
 
 
time. Only you or a lawyer can appear in court on your behalf. You may not send a friend or relative in your place. If you want to 
talk to a lawyer about your case, ask the judge for a continuance. 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IF YOU DO NOT GO TO COURT 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The case will go ahead whether or not you go to court. If you are not in court, the judge will only hear the Plaintiff’s side of the 
 
 
story and may order you to move within a very short period of time.  If you do not move during that period, the sheriff can evict you 
 
and all other occupants from the property and you may lose your belongings. If you miss your court date and the judge orders you 
 
to move, you can file a motion explaining why you missed court and ask the judge for another chance to explain why you should 
 
not be evicted. Talk to a lawyer or visit illinoislegalaid.org/ for more information. 
 

 
   
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

YOU HAVE RIGHTS 
 
1.  You may come to court and tell your side of the story. If you have any receipts, photographs, or other documents that support 
  
 
your side of the story, bring them to court. You can let the judge know that you have these documents when it is your turn to 
 
 
speak. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
2.  You have a right to demand a trial by jury. Jury trials are complicated, so you may want to consult with a lawyer before 
  
 
 
 
 

 
demanding a jury trial. A jury demand should be filed on or before the first date you have to come to court. If you have not 
  
 
done it by that date, the judge might not give you more time to file it. 
 
  

 
 

   

   

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
3.  You may have a lawyer represent you in court but the court will not appoint a lawyer for you.  If you want a lawyer, you must 
 
 
 

 
get one right away. You may go to the court date and ask the judge for time to get a lawyer. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
4.  You may be required to pay a fee to file an appearance or a jury demand. If you cannot afford the fee, you may fill out and file 
  
 

 
an Application for Waiver of Court Fees found at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-forms. 
  

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
5. 
 
 

 

 
If you do not have a lawyer but can afford one, you can call one of the following Lawyer Referral Services and ask them to 
 
recommend a lawyer for you: 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Chicago Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service: (312) 554-2001 
 
 
 
•  Cook County Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service:  (312) 630-1157

•  Other Lawyer Referral Services are available online. 
 
 
 

 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

If you cannot afford a lawyer, a legal aid organization may be able to help you for free or at a reduced rate. 
 
 
If you live in Cook County, call CARPLS: (312) 738-9200. CARPLS is a legal aid referral service that can connect 
 
you with one of Cook County’s many legal aid organizations. You may also contact these organizations directly:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
