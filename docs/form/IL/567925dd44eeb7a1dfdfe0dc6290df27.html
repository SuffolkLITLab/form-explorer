      <pre>HOW TO RESPOND TO A MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE 
 
COMPLAINT 
  

 

 

 

 

 

o	 
 

 

 

 

If you cannot afford the fee, you can ask the court to 
file for free. Fill out and file an Application for Waiver 
 
 
of Court Fees to ask the court for a fee waiver. This 
 
is a separate set of forms you can find at: 
  
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 
 

 

 

What if I think I have a defense to the foreclosure 
 
lawsuit? 
  
o	 
 

In Section C of the Mortgage Foreclosure 
Appearance & Answer, enter any defenses you 
have. You must state facts that support your 
 
 
 
defenses. 
If any of the following applies, you may wish to 
 
contact a lawyer: 
 

o	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	  Your lender violated any of the Making Home 
 
Affordable Program (HAMP) guidelines; for 
 
more information go to 
 
http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov; 
•	  Your mortgage company wrongfully denied 
 
 
 
your application for a loan modification; 
•	  Your mortgage company failed to respond to 
 
 
 
your request for a mortgage modification; 
•	  You had a loan modification application under 
 
 
review with your mortgage company when the 
 
foreclosure case was filed; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	  Your refinance or home equity loan is less 
 
 
 
than 3 years old and the lender did not 
 
accurately tell you information about the 
 
loan's Annual Percentage Rate (APR), 
 
finance charges, amount financed, total of 
 
payments or schedule of payments; 

 
 

 

 

 

•	  Your broker received an unreasonable lump-
 
sum payment (commission) for brokering the 
loan; 

   

•	  A contractor started the loan as part of a 
 

 

 
home repair contract; 
•	  You have your own insurance, and the lender 
 
 
 
has added an insurance premium to your 
account (force-placed insurance). In certain 
circumstances, forced insurance may be 
 
legal; OR 
 

•	  Your lender has not applied all of your 
 
 
 

  
payments to your account. 

 

 

•	  These situations do not necessarily mean you 
 
have a defense to your mortgage foreclosure 
 
 
case. Also, you might have a defense not 
  
listed here. 

o	  When you use the form Answer, you may be 
 

 

 

 

 
automatically admitting that certain facts are true, 
 
 
like that you were given all the required notices 
 
about the default on the mortgage. This is because 
if the Plaintiff uses an approved form foreclosure 
complaint, these facts do not have to be listed in the 
 
complaint. 

 

 

 

Who can use the Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & 
 
Answer? 
 
o	  You can use the Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & 
 
 
Answer if your name is listed on the Summons and the 
 
Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint as a Defendant. 
 
o	  NOTE: a Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint might also 
 
 
be called “Complaint to Foreclose Mortgage” or 
 
“Complaint for Foreclosure.” 
 

 

 

 

 
What form may I fill out and file with the court to 
 
respond to a Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint? 
 
o	  You may fill out the Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

& Answer form. 
  
If you and the other Defendants want to answer 
 
differently from each other, you may each file a 
 
separate Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & Answer. 
 

 

 

 

o	 
 

o	  NOTE: If you think the Complaint or the way you 
 

 

 

 

 

received it is defective in some way and you want to ask 
 
the court to dismiss the case or take other action, talk to 
an attorney before filing this form. 
  

 

 
 

 

 

 

 
What is a Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & Answer? 
 
o	  The Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & Answer tells 
 
 
 
the court you know about the foreclosure case and 
 
whether you agree or disagree with what was stated in 
 
the Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint. 
 
It also allows you to tell the court what defenses you 
 
have to the complaint. 
 
If you do not file a Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & 
 
Answer, the foreclosure case can go ahead without you 
 
and the court might rule against you. 
 

o	 
 

o	 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Where can I find the form I need? 
 
You can find the form at: 
 
 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 
Is there a deadline for filing the Mortgage Foreclosure 
 
Appearance & Answer? 
 
You must file within 30 days after you were properly served 
with the Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint. If you miss this 
 
deadline you can ask the court for an extension of time by 
 
filing a Motion to Extend Time to File. 
 
 
NOTE: If you have legal reason to challenge (quash) 
service of process you need to file a Motion before you file 
 
your Foreclosure Answer. You can find the Motion form at: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. You may 
 
want to consult with a lawyer about whether you have a 
legal reason to challenge (quash) service 735 ILCS 5/2-301. 
 
 
What costs will I need to pay to file a Mortgage 
 
 
Foreclosure Answer & Appearance? 
 
o	  There is a fee for each Mortgage Foreclosure 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appearance & Answer filed with the Circuit Clerk.

Step 2: Send a copy of your Mortgage Foreclosure 
  
 
Appearance & Answer to the other party. 
  
o	  You must send your forms to the other parties in the 
 
 
case. If a party has a lawyer, send the forms to the 
lawyer. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

o	  You may send forms to the other parties by 
 
 
personal hand delivery, by mail, third-party 
 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS), or 
 
through the court's electronic filing manager or an 
approved e-filing service provider. You may e-mail 
your form to a party if they have listed their e-mail 
 
address on a court document. Complete the proof of 
 
delivery with information to show how you sent the 
forms to each party. It has room for 3 parties. If you 
 
are sending forms to more than 3 parties, fill out and 
file one or more Additional Proof of Delivery forms 
 
with the main form. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 3: Get ready for your court date. 
 
o	  Decide and write down: 
 
 
•	  What you want to ask the judge to do for you; 
 
 
 
AND 
 
 

•	  What you will say to the judge if asked to tell your 
 
 

 

 

 

side of the case. 
  

 

o	  Gather and make copies of pictures and documents 
 
 
you want the judge to see.  Bring the original for the 
  
judge and one copy for you and each of the people 
in the case. 
 
 

 

 

 

Step 4: Go to your court date. 
 
o	  You should have received a court date and time 
 
from the Circuit Clerk when you filed your court 
 
forms OR on a written notice from the other party or 
 
Circuit Clerk. If you cannot find your court date and 
 
time, call the Circuit Clerk. 
 

 

 

 

 

o	  Bring these items with you to court: 
 
 

•	  A copy of the Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint 
 
 

and Summons; 
 

•	  Two copies of your completed and stamped 
 

 

Mortgage Foreclosure Appearance & Answer; 
AND 
 

 

•	  Other papers related to your mortgage or home 
 
such as: proof of your payment history, loan 
modification packet, information from a housing 
counselor, real estate sale contract, proof of 
 
employment or other income. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

o	  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
 
 
o	  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 
 
 

 

 

form. If your forms do not have a courtroom number 
 
look for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the 
Circuit Clerk. 

   

 

o	  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 
 
 

 

 

name and case number to be called. 
 

o	  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 
 
introduce yourself, and briefly tell the judge what 
 
you are asking for. The judge will let you know what 
 
will happen next. 
 

 

 

 

 

   

 

(02/18) 
 

 

A complete list of the facts that do not have to be listed 
 
in the approved form complaint can be found at 735 
 
ILCS 5/15- 1504(c).  If you want to deny any of these 
 
 
facts, do not use this form. 
o	  Visit http://www.illinoislegalaid.org/foreclosure for more 
 
information about mortgage foreclosure defense or to 
 
apply for legal help. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 
  
What do I do if I want to try to refinance my loan? 
•	  Check with your local courthouse to see if your county 
 
 

 

 

has a mediation program to assist foreclosure 
  
defendants. 

•	  See a HUD counselor for advice on your options. Call

What do I do after I fill out the Mortgage Foreclosure
 
 
Appearance & Answer?
 
 
Step 1: File your form with the Circuit Clerk in the
 
 
 
county where the court case is filed.
 
o	  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents

do not have a lawyer, or (2) you qualify for an 
  
exemption from e-filing. 
•	  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do not

you could use a computer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you have trouble 
  
reading or speaking in English.

•	  File the original and 1 copy of your Mortgage

How do I present my case to the judge?
 
 
 
Step 1: Tell the judge your side of the case and answer
 
 
 
questions.
 
 
o	  Bring any important documents relating to your 
 
 
 

foreclosure including documents mentioned above. 
 
•	  Give a copy to the judge and a copy to the other 
 
 

 

 

party. Be prepared to explain why the document is 
 
important. 
 

 

o	  The judge decides what materials can be considered in 
 
 
 

 
making a decision about your case. 

   

 
Step 2: What do I do when the other party presents their 
 
case? 
 
o	  The other party will also get to present their case. 
 
  
o	  Write down your questions while they are speaking to 
 
the other party or judge. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 3: What happens after both sides present their 
 
case? 
 
o	  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 
 
 

o	 
 

o	 
 

o	 
 

 

 

 

called a court order. 
  
If the judge needs more information to make a decision, 
 
the judge may set up another court date. Make sure you 
understand what information is needed and get it before 
the new court date. 
  
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge may 
 
let you know the decision later by mailing a court order 
 
 
or at another court date. 
   
If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
 
decide right then and fill out a court order. 
  
•	  Get a copy of the order that has the court stamp on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it. 
 
If the other party was not in court to get a copy, you 
 
 
must send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the date 
 
you get the order. Fill out and file a Proof of Delivery 
 
court form with the Circuit Clerk to show that you 
 
sent the copy. You may find the Proof of Delivery at: 
 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•	 
 

 

 

Step 4: Watch your mail

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
