HOW TO FILE AN APPEARANCE IN A CIVIL ASSET 
 
FORFEITURE CASE 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. 
 
 

Forfeiture): Only use this form if you need to send 
the Appearance (Civil Asset Forfeiture) to additional 
 
parties. 
 

o  Additional Proof of Delivery (Civil Asset 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Is there a deadline for filing an Appearance? 
 
o  The deadline for filing an Appearance is different 
 
 

depending on the type of case. 
 
 

o  You might have received other court papers, like a 
 
Summons, that give you a deadline for filing your 
 
Appearance. 
 

 

 

 

 

o  You might give up your right to participate in the 
 
court case if you do not file your Appearance on 
time. 
 

 

 

 

Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
 
 

 

 

 

What costs will I need to pay to file an Appearance? 
 
 
o  There is a fee for filing an Appearance with the 
 

 
Circuit Clerk. The fee will be higher if you ask for a 
jury. 
  
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
 
 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees. This is a 
 
 
separate set of forms you can find at: 
 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the Appearance form? 
 
Step 1: File the Appearance with the Circuit Clerk in 
 
the county where your court case is filed. 
  
o  You must file the Appearance (Civil Asset Forfeiture) 
 
 
with the trial court by the filing deadline that applies 
 
 
to your case. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
 
available. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

What is an Appearance? 
 
o  An Appearance is a form you file with the Circuit 
 
 
 

Clerk to tell the court and the other parties that you 
 
are participating in the court case. 
 
 

o  The Appearance also tells the court whether you 
 
want your case decided by a judge or a judge and 
 
jury. You do not have a right to a jury trial in every 
 
case. 
 
It also gives the court and other parties your name 
and address so they may contact you about the 
case. 
  
 

o 
 

 

 

 

Who can use the Appearance form? 
 
o  You can only file an Appearance for yourself, not for 
 
 

 

 

 

 

anyone else. 
 
In most cases, companies must have lawyers and 
 
should not use this Appearance form. 
 
 

 

 

 

o 
 

 

 

When do I need to use the Appearance form? 
 
The Appearance form is required in most civil court 
 
cases.  For example, you must file an Appearance when: 
 
 
o  Someone sues you and you want to participate in 
 

 

 

the court case. If you do not file an Appearance and 
go to court as needed, the court case might go 
 
ahead without you and the court might rule against 
 
you. 
 

 

 

o  You had a lawyer but your lawyer stops representing 
 
you, and you are now going to represent yourself. 
  
You do NOT need to file an Appearance when you start 
 
 
a new court case by yourself without a lawyer. 
 
 
 
What forms do I need to fill out to file an Answer to 
 
Complaint for Forfeiture (Not Involving Drugs or 
 
 
Money Laundering)? 
 
o  Appearance (Civil Asset Forfeiture): Use this form 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to tell the court and other parties that you are 
participating in the court case. You should file it at 
 
 
the same time you file your Answer or Hardship 
Motion. The email address (if you have one) and 
mailing address you put on the Appearance or 
 
Answer is where important legal documents will be 
sent to you. You should use an email account that 
 
you do not share with anyone else and that you 
check every day. If you do not check your email 
 
every day, you may miss important information, 
 
notice of court dates, or documents from other 
 
parties.

• 
 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 
   
•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

 

 

provider. 
  
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
user guides here: 
 
http://illinoiscourts.gov/CivilJustice/Resources/S 
elf-Represented_Litigants/E-
  
filing_Information.asp. 

o 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, take your form to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
  
terminal to e-file your form. 
•  You can bring your form on paper or saved on a 
 
 

  
flash drive. 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

  
that you can use to e-file your form. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 2: Send a copy of your Appearance to the other 
 
parties in the case. 
o  You must send your Appearance to the other parties 
 
 
 
 
in the case. If a party has a lawyer, send the forms 
to the lawyer. In a civil asset forfeiture case, you 
 
must send the Appearance to the state’s attorney’s 
office, the lien holder (if any), and anyone else who 
 
has an interest in the property. 
 
If you and the person you're sending the 
 
Appearance to have an email address, you must 
 
send them by email or by notification through the e-
filing system. If you or the person you’re sending the 
Appearance to does not have an email address, you 
 
may give them to the other parties by personal hand 
 
delivery, mail, or third-party commercial carrier (for 
 
example, FedEx or UPS). 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  You must complete the proof of delivery with 
 
 

 

 

 

information to show how you sent the forms to each 
 
party. It has room for 3 parties. If you are sending 
 
forms to more than 3 parties, fill out and file one or 
 
more Additional Proof of Delivery forms with your 
 
Appearance.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
