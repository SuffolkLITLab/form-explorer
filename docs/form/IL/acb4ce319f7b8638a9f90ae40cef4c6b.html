      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre> 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
 
address you put on the Appellee’s Brief is where 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share 
with anyone else and that you check every day. If 
   
 
you do not check your email every day, you may 
 
miss important information or documents from other 
 
 
 
parties. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

o  You might have to add pages to the form and 
 
remove pages from it.  If you have access to a 
 
    
computer with a PDF editing program (e.g., Adobe 
 
Acrobat), you can add and remove pages 
 
electronically.  Otherwise, you will have to print out 
 
 
the form and add and remove pages by hand. 
 
o  The Appellee’s Brief form contains several sections. 
 
 
 
o  The form contains instructions for each section.  The 
 

 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sections are: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
visitation, or removal of a child. 
 

 
Cover 
 
o  Check the top box if the appeal involves custody, 
 
 
 
o  Enter the appellate court case number (which you 
 
 
will receive from the appellate court clerk) and the 
appellate court district. 
 
o  Provide the name of the trial court case.  If the case 
 
was given a name beginning with “In re” (e.g., “In re 
Marriage of Jones”), enter that name.  Then, enter 
 
 
the names of the plaintiff/petitioner (the party who 
filed the trial court case) and the 
 
defendant/respondent (the party against whom the 
 
case was filed).  Finally, show which party is the 
 
 
appellant and which party is the appellee. 
 
o  Enter the trial court county, case number, and 
 
 

    
 

 
 
judge’s name. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

oral argument (see Step 4 below). 
 

o  Enter your name, address, and phone number.  You 
 
may also enter your email address, but, if you do, 
   
 
the court may use it to send you important 
 
documents.  Therefore, you should enter your email 
 
address only if you check your email frequently. 
 
 
o  Show whether you would like a chance to present 
 
 

   
 
 
o  The cover must be light blue. 
 
  
 
Points and Authorities 
 
o  State the title of each argument (each reason why 
 
 
you think the trial court’s decision or the jury’s 
 
 
decision is right).  Make the title of each argument 
 
responsive to the title of each argument in the 
 
Appellant’s Brief. 
 

 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  List the authorities (cases, statutes (laws), etc.) that 
 
 
 

 
you will use to support each argument. 
   
o  The form includes room to respond to 3 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    
 
 

arguments.  If the appellant is making more than 3 
arguments, fill out and insert one or more Additional 
 
Points and Authorities forms into the main form.

go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
What is an Appellee’s Brief? 
 
o  An Appellee’s Brief tells the appellate court why the 
 
 
trial court was right to enter an order or judgment in 
your favor. 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Who can use the Appellee’s Brief form? 
 
o  The Appellee’s Brief is filed by the appellee.  If you 
 
 
 

 
are responding to the appeal, you are the 
appellee.  (Your opponent, who filed the appeal, is 
  
 
called the appellant.) 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
   

 
When do I file the Appellee’s Brief form? 
 
o 
 

 
In general, your Appellee’s Brief must be filed within 
 
35 days after the due date for the Appellant’s Brief. 
  
However, in a case involving the custody of a child, 
 
for example, the appellate court may shorten that 
 
time. Be sure to ask the appellate court clerk's office 
for the schedule that applies to your case. If you 
need additional time, you may file a Motion with the 
appellate court to ask for an extension.  However, 
 
 
the appellate court is not required to give you an 
 
extension and may decide the case with only the 
Appellant’s Brief if you do not file your brief on 
time.  You are not required to file a brief, and your 
 
failure to file a brief does not mean that you will lose 
 
the appeal. 
 

   
 

   
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  For more information see the Guide for Appeals to 
 
 
the Illinois Appellate Court for Self-Represented 
 
Litigants: ilcourt.info/AOICAppealsGuide. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
What costs will I need to pay to file my Appellee's 
 
 
Brief form? 
 
 
o  None. 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Is there a page or word limit? 
 
 
o  Yes.  The Appellee's Brief—not including the cover, 
 
 
 

 
the statement of points and authorities, the 
certificate of compliance, the proof of service, and 
 
the appendix—must be no more than 50 pages or 
 
15,000 words. 
  
If you need more than 50 pages or 15,000 words, 
 
you may file a Motion with the appellate court to ask 
 
 
for permission to file a Brief with more pages or 
 
 
words. 
 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
How do I fill out the Appellee’s Brief form? 
o  Fill out the form online, or print it and fill it out by 
 
   
 
 
 
 

 
 
hand.  If you fill it out by hand, you must print neatly.

HOW TO FILE AN APPELLEE’S BRIEF 

 

 

 

Argument 
 
For each argument, state: 
 
o  The title of your argument; 
 
 
 
o  The standard of review (the level of deference the 
 
 
appellate court must give to the trial court or the 
jury); 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

o  The law that applies to the case; 
 
 
o  How the law applies to the facts; and 
 
 
 
o  What you want the appellate court to do. 
 
  
 
 
Include statutes (laws), rules, and cases that support 
 
 
your argument. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The form includes room to respond to 3 arguments.  The 
appellate court will not consider responses that are 
vague or incomplete.  If the appellant is making more 
 
than 3 arguments, fill out and insert one or more 
 
Additional Argument forms into the main form. 
 

 
    
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Conclusion 
 
State what you want the appellate court to do. 
 
 
 
Certificate of Compliance 
 
 
Certify that you have followed the rules for briefs, 
 
especially the page or word limit, by signing the 
 
 
Certificate of Compliance. 
 
 
 
Proof of Service 
 
 
Show how you are sending your Brief to the other 
 
 
parties. (see Step 1 below) 
  
 
Appendix 
 
You do not need to include this section, but you may do 
so if you disagree with the appellant’s version. 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Provide: 
 
o  An index to the record on appeal, including the 
 

 

 

 

 

common law record (the documents filed in the trial 
 
court); the report of proceedings (the transcript of 
 
the trial court hearings), if any; and the list of 
   
 
testifying witnesses; 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

and the Notice of Appeal (Civil); and 
 
 
 

o  The plaintiff’s complaint, the trial court’s judgment, 
 
 
 
 
o  Any other relevant materials from the record, noting 
 
 
those additions in the table of contents for the 
appendix. 
  
 

If necessary, fill out and insert one or more Additional 
 
Common Law Record, Additional Report of Proceedings, 
 
or Additional Index of Witnesses forms into the main 
 
form. 
 
 
What do I do after I fill out the form? 
 
 
 
Step 1: Send your Brief to all other parties. 
 
o  You must send your Brief to the other parties in the 
 
 
case.  However, if any party has a lawyer, you must 
 
 
send your Brief to the lawyer. 
 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

Nature of the Case 
 
 
o  You do not need to include this section, but you may 
 
 
do so if you disagree with the appellant's version. 
o  State why the lawsuit was filed and how the trial 
 
 
 
 
court or the jury ruled. 

 
         

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

Issues Presented for Review 
 
o  You do not need to include this section, but you may 
 
 
 
do so if you disagree with the appellant’s version. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  State the title of each argument again.  If the 
 
 
 

appellant is making more than 3 arguments, fill out 
 
and insert one or more Additional Issues forms into 
the main form. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
    

 
Jurisdiction 
 
You do not need to include this section, but you may do 
 
so if you disagree with the appellant’s version. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State why the appellate court has, or does not have, the 
 
power to hear the appeal. 
 
o  The appellate court has the power to hear an appeal 
 
 
 
only if the trial court’s judgment is appealable under 
 
 
an Illinois Supreme Court Rule. 
 
   

   

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

    

o  Tell the appellate court which rule, if any, applies 
 
 
 
and why.  If no rule applies, explain why not. 
  
o  State the filing dates of the trial court’s judgment, its 
 
 
 
rulings on any motions that were filed after the 
 
judgment, and the Notice of Appeal (Civil).  State 
 
whether the Notice of Appeal (Civil) was filed on 
time. 
  

 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

Statutes (Laws) Involved 
 
o  You do not need to include this section, but you may 
 
 
do so if you disagree with the appellant’s version. 
 
If your case involves a statute (law), constitutional 
 
provision, treaty, ordinance, or regulation, state the 
language and the number (e.g., 735 ILCS 5/2-615) 
 
 
of each provision so others can find that 
 
language.  The number of a provision is also called 
  
 
 
the citation. 
 
If you need more room, fill out and insert one or 
 
 
more Additional Statutes Involved forms into the 
 
main form. 
 
 

o 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Statement of Facts 
 
 
o  You do not need to include this section, but you may 
 
 
do so if you disagree with the appellant’s version. 
  
o  Tell the appellate court what happened in the trial 
 
 
 
court from beginning to end.  Include the page 
numbers of the record on appeal where the 
information you include is located.  Do not argue or 
 
 
comment. 
If you need more room, fill out and insert one or 
 
 
more Additional Statement of Facts forms into the 
main form.

Step 3: Wait for the Appellant’s Reply Brief. 
 
o 
 

 
In general, the Appellant’s Reply Brief is due within 
 
14 days after the due date for your Appellee’s 
 
Brief.  The appellant is not required to file a reply 
 
 
 
brief.  The appellant’s failure to file a reply brief does 
 
not mean that you will win the appeal. 
 

  
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Step 4: Wait for oral argument, if any. 
  
o  After all the briefs are filed, the appellate court may 
 
 
 
send you a notice to appear for oral argument, even 
if you did not ask for oral argument on the cover of 
 
 
 
your Appellee’s Brief.  (If you did ask for oral 
 
 
  
argument, the appellate court is not required to have 
oral argument.)  If you get a notice, arrive on time for 
 
 
the court date.  When your appeal is called, the 
 
appellant will explain their argument to the judges. 
  
 
You will then get a chance to respond.  Be prepared 
to answer any questions.  After you argue, the 
  
appellant will get a chance to reply. 
 

    
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 
Step 5: Wait for the appellate court's decision. 
  
o  The appellate court will send you a written decision. 
 
 
  
 

This might take several months. 
 
If you think that the appellate court overlooked or 
 
 
misunderstood any of your points, you may file a 
Petition for Rehearing, which is due within 21 days 
 
after the date of the decision.  You must point out 
 
errors in the decision; you are not allowed to reargue 
 
your case. 
 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you and the person you're sending the Appellee’s 
 
Brief to have an email address, you must send it by 
 
email or by notification through the e-filing system. If 
   
you or the person you’re sending the Appellee’s 
 
Brief to does not have an email address, you may 
 
give it to the other parties by personal hand delivery, 
 
 
 
mail, or third-party commercial carrier (for example, 
 
FedEx or UPS). 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

Step 2: File your Brief with the appellate court. 
 
o  You must file the Appellee’s Brief with the trial court 
 
 
 
by the filing deadline that applies to your case. 
  
 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
 
available. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

 

 

 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms/. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 
 

 
provider. 
  
o  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
 
help/how-to-e-file/. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

   
 

If you do not have access to a computer, or if you 
 
need additional help, you may take your Brief to the 
appellate court clerk’s office, where you can use a 
public terminal to e-file your Brief. You can bring 
your Brief on a flash drive or on paper. The terminal 
 
will have a scanner and computer where you can 
scan, save, and e-file your Brief. To locate the clerk 
 
 
 
of the appellate court district where your appeal has

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
