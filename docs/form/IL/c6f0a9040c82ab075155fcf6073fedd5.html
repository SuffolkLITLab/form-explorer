electronically.  Otherwise, you will have to print out 
 
 
the form and add and remove pages by hand. 
 
o  The email address (if you have one) and mailing 
 
 
address you put on the Appellant’s Brief is where 
important legal documents will be sent to you. You 
should use an email account that you do not share 
with anyone else and that you check every day. If 
   
 
you do not check your email every day, you may 
 
miss important information or documents from other 
 
 
 
parties. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The Appellant’s Brief form contains several sections. 
 
 
 
The form contains instructions for each section.  The 
sections are: 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
visitation, or removal of a child. 
 

 
Cover 
 
o  Check the top box if the appeal involves custody, 
 
 
 
o  Enter the appellate court case number (which you 
 
 
will receive from the appellate court clerk) and the 
 
appellate court district. 
o  Provide the name of the trial court case.  If the case 
 
was given a name beginning with “In re” (e.g., “In re 
Marriage of Jones”), enter that name.  Then, enter 
 
 
the names of the plaintiff/petitioner (the party who 
filed the trial court case) and the 
 
defendant/respondent (the party against whom the 
 
case was filed).  Finally, show which party is the 
 
 
appellant and which party is the appellee. 
 
o  Enter the trial court county, case number, and 
 
 

    
 

 
 
judge’s name. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Enter your name, address, and phone number.  You 
 
may also enter your email address, but, if you do, 
 
   
the court may use it to send you important 
 
documents.  Therefore, you should enter your email 
 
 
address only if you check your email frequently. 
 
 
o  Show whether you would like a chance to present 
 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oral argument (see Step 4 below). 
 

   
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  The cover must be white. 
 
  
 
Points and Authorities 
 
o  State the title of each argument (each reason why 
 
 
you think the trial court’s decision or the jury's 
 
 
 
decision is wrong). 
 
 
you will use to support each argument. 
 

o  List the authorities (cases, statutes (laws), etc.) that 
 
 
 
o  You may raise as many arguments as you like, as 
 
 
 

long as they are reasonable. 
   
If you raise an unreasonable argument, the 
 
appellate court may strike the Brief or impose 
penalties. 
  
 

o  The form includes room for 3 arguments.  If you are 
 
 
making more than 3 arguments, fill out and insert 
 
one or more Additional Points and Authorities forms 
 
into the main form. 
 

    

o 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
Nature of the Case 
 
 
o  State why the lawsuit was filed and how the trial 
 
 
 
 
court or the jury ruled.

What is an Appellant’s Brief? 
 
o  An Appellant’s Brief tells the appellate court why the 
 
 
trial court should not have entered an order or 
 
judgment against you. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Who can use the Appellant’s Brief form? 
 
o  The Appellant’s Brief is filed by the appellant. If you 
 
 
filed the Notice of Appeal (Civil), you are the 
 
appellant. (Your opponent is called the appellee.) 

   

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
When do I file the Appellant’s Brief form? 
 
o 
 

 
In general, your Appellant’s Brief must be filed within 
 
35 days after the record on appeal is filed. However, 
 
 
in cases involving custody of a child, for example, 
 
 
the appellate court may shorten that time. Be sure to 
ask the appellate court clerk's office for the schedule 
that applies to your case. If you need additional time, 
   
 
you may file a Motion with the appellate court to ask 
 
 
for an extension. However, the appellate court is not 
 
 
required to give you an extension and may throw out 
 
your appeal if you do not file your Brief on time. 
 
o  For more information see the Guide for Appeals to 
 
 
the Illinois Appellate Court for Self-Represented 
Litigants: ilcourts.info/AOICAppealsGuide. 
  

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   
  

 
What costs will I need to pay to file my Appellant's 
 
 
Brief form? 
 
 
o  None. 
 
 
 
Is there a page or word limit? 
 
 
 
o  Yes.  The Appellant's Brief—not including the cover, 
 
 
 

 
the statement of points and authorities, the 
certificate of compliance, the proof of service, and 
 
the appendix—must be no more than 50 pages or 
 
15,000 words. 
  
If you need more than 50 pages or 15,000 words, 
 
you may file a Motion with the appellate court to ask 
 
for permission to file a Brief with more pages or 
 
words. 
 
 

o 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
   

   
 

 
    
 

How do I fill out the Appellant’s Brief form? 
 
o  Fill out the form online, or print it and fill it out by 
 
 
 
 

 
 
hand.  If you fill it out by hand, you must print neatly. 
 
o  You will have to add pages to the form, particularly 
 
 
 
 
in the appendix, and you might have to remove 
   
pages from it. If you have access to a computer with 
 
a PDF editing program (e.g., Adobe Acrobat), you 
 
can add and remove pages

HOW TO FILE AN APPELLANT’S BRIEF 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Certificate of Compliance 
o  Certify that you have followed the rules for briefs, 
 
 
 
 
especially the page or word limit, by signing the 
  
 
Certificate of Compliance. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Proof of Service 
o  Show how you are sending your Brief to the other 
 
 

 
  
parties. (see Step 1 below) 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Appendix 
 
Provide: 
o  An index to the record on appeal, including the 
 

 

 

 

 

 
common law record (the documents filed in the trial 
 
court); the report of proceedings (the transcript of 
   
 
the trial court hearings), if any; and the list of 
  
 
testifying witnesses; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

o  The plaintiff’s complaint, the trial court’s judgment, 
 
 
 

 
 
and your Notice of Appeal (Civil); and 
 

o  Any other relevant materials from the record, noting 
 
 
those additions in the table of contents for the 
 
appendix. 
 

 
If necessary, fill out and insert one or more Additional 
 
Common Law Record, Additional Report of Proceedings, 
 
or Additional Index of Witnesses forms into the main 
 
form. 
 
 
 
 
What do I do after I fill out the form? 
 
Step 1: Send your Brief to all other parties. 
o  You must send your Brief to the other parties in the 
 
 
 
   
case. However, if any party has a lawyer, you must 
 
 
send your Brief to the lawyer. 
 
 
If you and the person you're sending the Brief to 
 
 
 
 
have an email address, you must send it by email or 
 
 
by notification through the e-filing system. If you or 
the person you’re sending the Brief to does not have 
 
 
an email address, you may give it to the other 
 
parties by personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
  
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 

 
   
 

 
 

o 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
Step 2: File your Brief with the appellate court. 
o  You must file the Appellant’s Brief with the trial court 
 
 
 
  
 
by the filing deadline that applies to your case. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
 
 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
  
exemption from e-filing. 
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
  
available. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 
 
 
Issues Presented for Review 
o  State the title of each argument again. 
 
  
 
o 
 

 
If you are making more than 3 arguments, fill out 
and insert one or more Additional Issues forms into 
 
the main form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Jurisdiction 
o  State why the appellate court has the power to hear 
 
 

 

 

 

 

your appeal. 

 

o  The appellate court has the power to hear an appeal 
 
 
 
 
 
only if the trial court’s judgment is appealable under 
 
   
an Illinois Supreme Court Rule. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Tell the appellate court which rule applies and why. 
 
 
 
o  State the filing dates of the trial court’s judgment, its 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rulings on any motions that were filed after the 
 
 
 
judgment, and your Notice of Appeal (Civil), so the 
appellate court knows whether you filed your Notice 
 
of Appeal (Civil) on time. 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
   
 
 

 
 
Statutes (Laws) Involved 
o 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
If your case involves a statute (law), constitutional 
provision, treaty, ordinance, or regulation, state the 
 
 
language and the number (e.g., 735 ILCS 5/2-615) 
 
of each provision so others can find that 
  
 
 
language.  The number of a provision is also called 
 
the citation. 
 
 
If you need more room, fill out and insert one or 
 
more Additional Statutes Involved forms into the 
 
main form. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  

 
 
Statement of Facts 
o  Tell the appellate court what happened in the trial 
 
 
 
court from beginning to end.  Include the page 
numbers of the record on appeal where the 
 
 
information you include is located.  Do not argue or 
  
comment. 
 
 
If you need more room, fill out and insert one or 
more Additional Statement of Facts forms into the 
 
 
main form. 

o 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Argument 
 
For each argument, state: 
o  The title of your argument; 
 
 
 
o  The standard of review (the level of deference the 
 
 
appellate court must give to the trial court or the 
 
jury); 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

o  The law that applies to the case; 
 
 
o  How the law applies to the facts; and 
 
 
 
o  What you want the appellate court to do. 
 
  
 
Include statutes (laws), rules, and cases that support 
 
 
 
your argument. The appellate court will not consider 
 
arguments that are vague or incomplete. 
 
If you are making more than 3 arguments, fill out and 
insert one or more Additional Argument forms into the 
 
 
main form. 
 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Conclusion 
o  State what you want the appellate court to do.

If you think that the appellate court overlooked or 
 
misunderstood any of your points, you may file a 
Petition for Rehearing, which is due within 21 days 
 
after the date of the decision.  You must point out 
 
errors in the decision; you are not allowed to reargue 
 
 
your case. 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

 

• 
 

 

 

 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms/. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 

 

 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 
 

 
provider. 
  
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   
 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
 
need help e-filing, bring your form to the trial court 
 
clerk’s office or appellate court clerk’s office where 
you can use a public computer terminal to e-file your 
 
form. For more help, including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 
 
 
or go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
   
o  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on a 
 
 
flash drive. The terminal will have a scanner and 
 
computer that you can use to e-file your form. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
Step 3: Wait for the Appellee’s Brief. 
 
 
o 
 

 
In general, the Appellee's Brief is due within 35 days 
 
 
after the due date for your Appellant’s Brief.  The 
 
appellee is not required to file a brief. The appellee’s 
  
 
failure to file a brief does not mean that you will win 
 
the appeal. 
 
If the appellee files a brief, you may file a Reply 
 
 
Brief, which generally is due within 14 days after the 
 
 
due date for the Appellee's Brief. Again, ask the 
 
appellate court clerk's office for the schedule that 
 
applies to your case.  You are not required to file a 
 
Reply Brief.  Your failure to file a Reply Brief does 
 
 
not mean that you will lose the appeal. 
   

 
  

o 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Step 4: Wait for oral argument, if any. 
  
o  After all the briefs are filed, the appellate court may 
 
 
 
send you a notice to appear for oral argument, even 
if you did not ask for oral argument on the cover of 
 
 
 
your Appellant’s Brief.  (If you did ask for oral 
 
 
  
argument, the appellate court is not required to have 
 
oral argument.)  If you get a notice, arrive on time for 
 
 
the court date.  When your appeal is called, explain 
 
your argument to the judges.  Be prepared to 
answer any questions.  After you argue, the appellee 
  
 
will get a chance to respond, and you will get a 
 
chance to reply. 

    
  
 

  
 
 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 5: Wait for the appellate court's decision. 
  
o  The appellate court will send you a written decision. 
 
 
  
 

This might take several months.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
