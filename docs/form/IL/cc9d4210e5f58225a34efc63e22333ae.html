condominium actions against owners, public and 
project based subsidized housing, and contracts for 
deed (also called rent to own agreements or 
installment sales agreements). These cases might 
have additional legal requirements that these forms 
do not meet, so you may want to talk with a lawyer. 

o  Some cities, including Chicago, have different or 
additional requirements that these instructions do 
not discuss. Check with your local government about 
whether your city has adopted ordinances that apply 
to your eviction case. 

o  Most of these instructions assume that you are a 
landlord and that the people you are trying to evict 
are tenants. If the person is not a tenant, see the 
section entitled "How do I evict other occupants, 
squatters, or trespassers living in my property?" on 
page 3. 
 

Where can I find the forms that I need? 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms. 

hat costs will I need to pay to ask the court to evict 

an occupant? 
o  The Circuit Clerk charges a filing fee and the sheriff 
charges a service fee.  Contact your Circuit Clerk 
and sheriff to ask what filing an eviction case costs 
in your county.  
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
the Application for Waiver of Court Fees found at  
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms. 

o 

hen can I start the eviction process? 

You may start an eviction case in any of these 
circumstances: 
o  Your tenant owes rent;  
o  Your tenant’s lease is about to expire and you do not 

want to renew it; 

o  Your tenant has violated the terms of the lease; 
o  Your tenant has no written lease and you would like 

them to move; OR 

o  An occupant is living on the property and they refuse 

  W

  W

to leave. 
 

What are the steps in the eviction process? 
o  Step 1: Serve the Defendants with written notice.  
o  Step 2: Fill out and file an Eviction Complaint and 

Eviction Summons. 

o  Step 3: Serve the Eviction Complaint and Eviction 

Summons on the Defendants.  

o  Step 4: Go to court. 
o  Step 5: Enforce the Eviction Order. 
These steps are described in more detail below. 

his page gives the basics of the eviction process. For 

more detail on the process, read this whole packet. 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
go to ilcourthelp.gov.   

ho is the Plaintiff and who are the Defendants in 

this case? 
o  The Plaintiff files the lawsuit and is usually the 

landlord or owner of the property. If a corporation or 
LLC owns the property, it must hire a lawyer. 
Property managers cannot file on behalf of the 
owner.  

o  The Defendants are being sued and are the tenants 
or occupants of your property. A tenant is someone 
with an oral or written lease. An occupant is 
someone who does not have an oral or written 
lease, but lives in the property (includes squatters 
and trespassers). 

o  The Plaintiff files an eviction case to make the 

Defendants move out. The Plaintiff can also ask for 
unpaid rent. 

ow do I evict someone living on my property? 

o  There is only one way to evict a tenant or an 
occupant who does not agree to leave.   

o  You must file an eviction case, win the case, get an 
eviction order, and ask the sheriff to enforce this 
order by performing an eviction.   

o  NOTE: Trying to evict a person without a court order 
is AGAINST THE LAW! You may not change locks, 
turn off utilities, or take any other action on your own 
to try to force a person to move. 

ho should use these forms?  

o 

o  These forms can help landlords or property owners 

who do not have a lawyer to file an eviction case. Do 
not try to file an eviction case until you have read 
this entire document. 
If you are not a lawyer, you cannot represent 
another person's interest in court. You must be the 
named plaintiff in an eviction and complete and sign 
all the filings on your own behalf. If a corporation or 
LLC owns the property, it must hire a lawyer.  
o  These instructions apply to most residential eviction 

cases. If there is a lease, it may provide for 
additional tenant rights.  If it does, follow those. 
These forms are not intended to be used in these 
cases: commercial, post-foreclosure, mobile homes,

•  Handing it to the Defendant;  
•  Handing it to a person who is at least 13 years 

old and lives in the property;  

•  Sending a copy of the notice to the Defendant 
by certified or registered mail, with a returned 
receipt from the addressee (such as a green 
card); OR   

•  Posting it on the door, but ONLY if no one lives 

in the property.  

NOTE: The service requirements may be different if 
required by the lease, local landlord-tenant law, or 
subsidized housing programs. If you are confused about 
this very important step in the process, talk with a 
lawyer. 

ow do I know when the notice period ends? 

o  Each Notice has a different notice period.  
o  The day you serve the Notice does not count. 
o  The notice period starts the day after you serve the 

Notice. 

o  The notice period ends at midnight of the last day of 

the notice period.  

o 

o  You can file your case the day after the notice 

period ends. 
If the last day of the notice period is a Saturday, 
Sunday, or court holiday, the notice period ends at 
midnight of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or court holiday. 

o  For example, if you serve a Notice of Termination 
for Non-Payment of Rent (also known as a 5-day 
notice) on a Monday, Day 1 would start on Tuesday. 
Because Day 5 would be a Saturday, the notice 
period continues until the following Monday and you 
could file the eviction case on Tuesday. If that 
Monday is a court holiday, the notice period 
continues until Tuesday and you could file the 
eviction case on Wednesday.  

  H

  H

ow do I evict my tenant for not paying rent?  
o  Serve the tenant with a Notice of Termination for 
Non-Payment of Rent that demands that the 
overdue rent be paid within 5 days. This Notice is 
often called a "5-Day Notice." NOTE:  
• 

If your tenant offers you the full amount of the 
rent demanded in the Notice within 5 days, you 
must accept it and you cannot file the Eviction 
Complaint. 

• 

If your tenant offers you the full amount of the 
rent demanded in the Notice after the 5 days 
has passed but before you have filed an Eviction 
Complaint, you may accept the money but if you 
do, you will not be able to file the Eviction 
Complaint.  

How do I serve the written notice?  
o  You may serve the notice by: 

STEP 1: SERVE THE 
DEFENDANTS WITH WRITTEN 
NOTICE 

hat type of notice should I use to tell the 

o 

Defendants I am evicting them? 
The type of notice you use depends on the reason for 
the eviction. Below is a list of the most common types of 
notices. 
o 

If the tenant has not paid rent, you can use a Notice 
of Termination for Non-Payment of Rent (also known 
as a 5-Day Notice).  
If the tenant has violated the lease in another way 
other than the non-payment of rent, use a Notice of 
Termination for Lease Violation (Other than Non-
Payment of Rent) (also known as a 10-Day Notice). 
If you do not want to renew an expiring lease, use a 
Notice of Non-Renewal of Lease (also known as a 
30-Day Notice).  
If you are not renting to the occupants, use a 
Demand for Immediate Possession. 

o 

o 

o  Whoever serves the Notice or Demand should fill out 

an Affidavit of Service of a Demand or Notice 
describing how and when they served the Notice on 
the Defendants. This Affidavit may make it easier to 
prove in Court that the Notice was served. 

o  You only need to prepare 1 Notice or Demand and 1 
Affidavit of Service of a Demand or Notice even if 
you have more than 1 tenant or unknown occupant 
to serve. Be sure to keep a copy of each one for 
yourself.  

Each Notice, except for the Demand for Immediate 
Possession, has a different notice period. This is the 
number of days you must wait after the Notice is served 
before you can file your Eviction Complaint.  If you file 
the Eviction Complaint before the notice period ends, the 
judge may dismiss it and you will have to start over. 
NOTE: The notice requirements may be different if 
required by the lease, local landlord-tenant law, or in 
cases involving commercial leases, post-foreclosure, 
mobile homes, condominium actions against owners, 
public and project based subsidized housing, and 
contracts for deed (also called rent to own agreements 
or installment sales agreements).

the tenant of this right. Check the lease and contact 
your city or county officials and get a copy of any 
local landlord-tenant laws.  
If the tenant has the right to fix the problem and the 
tenant fixes the problem before the notice period 
expires, you may not evict the tenant for that lease 
violation. If the tenant does not have the right to fix 
the problem or has the right to but does not fix the 
problem within the notice period, you can file the 
Eviction Complaint after the notice period ends. 
 

How do I evict a tenant who has no written lease? 
If you ever had an agreement that allowed the 
o 
occupant to pay rent to stay in the property, they are 
a tenant whether or not they had a written lease. 
o  A tenant with no written lease usually has a month-
to-month tenancy. Oral leases can also have other 
types of time periods that require a different kind of 
notice. If you think your lease is not a month to 
month, tenancy, you may wish to speak with a 
lawyer or visit illinoislegalaid.org/legal-
information/written-eviction-notices.  

o  A tenant with a written lease that has expired may 
also be considered to have a month-to-month 
tenancy if the landlord continues to accept rent. If 
you are not sure, talk with a lawyer.  

o  You must first serve the tenant with a Notice of Non-
Renewal of Lease or Termination of Tenancy (also 
known as a 30-Day Notice). You may terminate a 
month-to-month tenancy with at least 30 days' 
advance written notice. Most rental periods run from 
the first of the month to the last day of the month. 
Therefore, serve your notice at least 30 days before 
the end of the month.  
 

When can I NOT evict my tenant? 
o  You may not evict a tenant merely because they 
have engaged in an activity the law protects.  
•  Protected activities include complaining to a 

government official about conditions at the 
property.   

•  Local landlord-tenant laws may protect 
additional activities such as requesting 
reasonable repairs or organizing tenants.  
•  You may not engage in unlawful discrimination. 

TEP 2: FILL OUT AND FILE AN 

EVICTION COMPLAINT AND 
EVICTION SUMMONS 

hat forms do I need to file an eviction case? 

You will need these documents:  
o  Eviction Complaint: asks the court for an eviction 

and gives information needed to begin the eviction. 

    S

  W

• 

If your tenant offers you the full amount of the 
rent demanded in the Notice after you filed an 
Eviction Complaint, ask the judge before 
cashing the check or before spending or 
depositing the money. 
 

How do I evict a tenant whose lease has ended and I 
do not want to renew? 
If the lease ends on a specific date (and the lease terms 
do not say it automatically changes to a month-to-month 
tenancy) and your tenant does not move out, you may 
file an Eviction Complaint the very next day.  
o  You may not file an eviction action the very next day 
if your local landlord-tenant law or lease requires 
you to give your tenant advance written notice that 
you do not want to renew the lease.   
If you are unsure about whether a notice is required, 
it is better to give your tenant a Notice. 

o 

OTE: Under Chicago law, renters must be given 

written notice that the lease will not be renewed at least 
30 days before the end of their lease.  

ow do I evict other occupants, squatters, or 

trespassers living in my property? 
o 

If you are unsure if the occupants have a lease or 
not, you need to try to make contact with them to 
find out if they have a lease and to get a copy of it if 
it is in writing.   
• 

If they have an existing lease, you may have to 
honor it.   

If the people living in your property do not have a 
lease and you never accepted rent from them or 
agreed to let them stay on your property, you can 
serve them with a Demand for Immediate 
Possession. You can file your Eviction Complaint 
immediately after you serve this demand.  

NOTE: Some qualified renters in foreclosed properties 
may have additional rights to remain or receive 
relocation assistance. Talk with a lawyer prior to filing 
your Eviction Complaint if you think that these or other 
issues could come up.

  H

o 

  H

ow do I evict a tenant who has paid their rent but 

has violated some other lease term? 
o  You may serve the tenant with a Notice of 

Termination for Lease Violation (Other than Non-
Payment of Rent) (also known as a 10-Day Notice) 
stating that you are terminating the lease. This 
Notice should be specific about how the tenant 
violated the lease. If possible, you should name the 
person who violated the lease, describe the 
violation, and state when the violation happened. 
o  Some local landlord-tenant laws and leases give the 
tenant a right to fix the problem before the notice 
period expires (if the problem can be fixed). This is 
sometimes called the right to "cure." If the tenant has 
the right to fix the problem, the Notice must inform

You should include “All Unknown Occupants” as a 
Defendant. If the sheriff comes out to evict the 
people on the property and finds someone there 
who was not named, the sheriff will not evict that 
person unless you have included "All Unknown 
Occupants" as a Defendant. 

hen can I ask for rent and other remedies?  

In your Eviction Complaint, you can ask the court for any 
of the following:  
o  To have the sheriff evict the Defendants and give 

you possession of the property; 

o  Court costs, including filing and service fees;  
o  All past due rent and any rent that comes due while 
the case is pending, if there is an oral or written 
lease; 

o  Rental value for the property for the time the 

Defendants lived in the property, even if there is no 
oral or written lease. This is called "use and 
occupancy" value; AND 

o  Attorney's fees if you have a written agreement 
(such as a lease) that says the Defendants are 
responsible for them, unless local law prohibits this. 

If you are unsure about whether you can request a 
particular remedy in an eviction case, talk with a lawyer. 
In your Eviction Complaint, you cannot ask for:  
o  Money to compensate you for damages to the 
property caused by the Defendants; OR 

o  Money for other claims against the Defendants that 
are not related to possession of the property.  
Even if you cannot ask for a particular remedy in your 
Eviction Complaint, you may be able to file a different 
kind of lawsuit. 

ow can I get a court date (sometimes called a 
“return date”) to put on my Eviction Summons?  
You must ask for a court date that gives the sheriff or 
special process server enough time to serve the 
Defendant at least 3 days before the court date (7 days 
in Cook County). 
o  Outside Cook County: 

•  Before filing your case, contact your local Circuit 
Clerk’s office to ask about their process for filing 
the Eviction Complaint and Summons. To find 
the Circuit Clerk’s phone number, visit 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/. 

•  Once you have your court date, fill in that 
information on the Eviction Summons. 

  H

o 

In Cook County: 
• 

If you are e-filing in Cook County, select your 
court date in the “return date” field. The Circuit 
Clerk will print the court date, time and 
courtroom number on the Eviction Complaint 
and Eviction Summons when you e-file. 

o 

  W

If there is any past due rent when you file the 
Complaint, you may ask for this rent in the 
Complaint. You may also ask for any rent that will 
come due during the case.  
You MUST attach the following to the Eviction 
Complaint: 
•  a copy of the Notice or Demand (if any);  
•  Affidavit of Proof of Service of a Demand or 

Notice; AND 

•  Relevant parts of the written lease, if your 

Eviction Complaint is based on a lease violation. 
If you had a written lease that ended and you 
accepted rent from your tenants, you must 
attach the most recent lease to the Eviction 
Complaint. 

If you do not have a Notice, Demand, or Affidavit of 
Service of a Demand or Notice, or lease: 
• 

you should attach an Affidavit – Supporting 
Documents Not Attached to Complaint. The 
Affidavit – Supporting Documents Not Attached 
to Complaint explains why you did not attach a 
Notice, Demand or lease to the Eviction 
Complaint. 

• 

If you do not attach the necessary documents to 
your Eviction Complaint, your case may be 
dismissed. 

o  Eviction Summons: tells the Defendants that you are 
asking the court for an eviction and gives the court 
date. 

o  Eviction Order: is used by the judge to grant or deny 

your eviction.  

The email address (if you have one) and mailing address 
you put on the forms is where important legal documents 
will be sent to you. You should use an email account that 
you do not share with anyone else and that you check 
every day. If you do not check your email every day, you 
may miss important information, notice of court dates, or 
documents from other parties. 

here can I find the forms I need? 

You can find the forms at 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default.asp. 

ho should I name as Plaintiff in the Eviction 

Complaint? 
o  You must be the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff files the 

lawsuit and is usually the landlord or owner of the 
property. If a corporation or LLC owns the property, 
it must hire a lawyer. Property managers cannot file 
on behalf of the owner.  
 

Who should I name as Defendants in the Eviction 
Complaint when multiple people live on the 
property? 
o 

You should name every adult who lives in the 
property.

o  Serving a Defendant who does not live in the county 

where the case was filed: 
•  Get the name, address, and telephone number 

for the sheriff in the county where the Defendant 
lives. 

•  Call the sheriff’s office to confirm the number of 

copies the sheriff requires. 

o 

• 

If you have an Order for Waiver of Court Fees, 
confirm that the sheriff will accept this. It must 
be accepted by all sheriffs in Illinois, but not in 
other states. 

•  Mail copies of your forms to the sheriff’s office 
as explained in the By mail section above. 
If you are not able to serve the other party before 
your court date, go to the court date and ask the 
judge to let you file a new Eviction Summons 
(sometimes called an “Alias Eviction Summons”) 
and set another court date. This will give you time to 
serve the new Eviction Summons with the new date 
and time. 
•  Go back to Step 2 to file this new Eviction 

Summons. Remember to bring the judge’s order 
to the Circuit Clerk setting the new date. 

•  Follow Step 3 and ask the sheriff to try to serve 
the other party again. Remember to attach the 
original Eviction Complaint to the new Eviction 
Summons. 

If you do not wish to use the sheriff, you may be 
able to use a special process server to serve the 
Eviction Summons instead.  

•  For information about how to use a special 
process server, see How to File & Send a 
Motion to Appoint Special Process Server at 
illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/Circuit.asp. 

• 

 

What if the sheriff or special process server has 
tried and been unable to serve the Eviction 
Summons and Eviction Complaint personally?  
The sheriff may be able to serve the Defendants by 
posting notices of the eviction in the area around the 
property. Serving the Defendants in this way is called 
“service by posting.”   
You must follow special rules to serve the Defendants by 
posting. If you do not follow the special rules, the judge 
may make you serve the Defendants again.  
o  Before you can serve by posting, you must first 
make a “diligent inquiry” to have the sheriff or 
special process server find and serve the 
Defendants in person. A diligent inquiry means you 
have tried every commonsense way to find and 
serve them. This may include attempts by the sheriff 
or special process server to find and serve the 
Defendants at the property on different dates and at 
different times of day. If you know of other 
addresses where the Defendants could be served 
(like their work or a friend or family member’s 

address), you must try to have them served at these 
addresses as well.  

o  After you have had the sheriff or special process 
server make a diligent inquiry and they have been 
unable to serve the Defendants in person, then you  
may serve them by posting.  

o  To serve the Defendants by posting, you must:  
•  Complete an Affidavit for Service by Posting, 

which states why you need to serve by posting. 
You have to show at least 1 of the following: 
  The Defendant lives outside of Illinois;  
  The Defendant has gone outside of Illinois; 
  You know the Defendant is in Illinois but you 

cannot find them; OR 

  You cannot find the Defendant after trying 

your best. 

•  Bring your Affidavit for Service by Posting to 

your court date. Tell the judge you will serve the 
Defendants by posting.    

•  Fill out a Notice Requiring Appearance in 

Pending Eviction Action.  

o  You will need to put a new court date on the Notice 
by Posting Requiring Appearance in Pending 
Eviction Action before you file it. 
• 

If you got a court date from the judge, put that 
date, time and courtroom on the Notice.  

• 

If you did not get a court date from the judge, 
call the Circuit Clerk to ask for a court date. Put 
that date, time, and courtroom on the Notice.  
o  File the Affidavit for Service by Posting and a copy 
of the Notice by Posting Requiring Appearance in 
Pending Eviction Action that will be posted.  
o  The Circuit Clerk or the sheriff may charge fees to 
file or serve your Affidavit and Notice by Posting 
Requiring Appearance in Pending Eviction Action. If 
you have an Order for Waiver of Court Fees, all or 
part of these fees will be waived. 

o  After you file, give the Notice to the sheriff to post 

and pay your part of any fees. The sheriff may need 
multiple copies of the Notice or other papers before 
they will serve the Defendants by posting. Call the 
sheriff’s office and ask for their requirements.  
o  The sheriff must post the Notice at least 10 days 

before the court date. The sheriff will file an affidavit 
proving they served the Defendants by posting. 
NOTE: Only a sheriff can serve the Defendants by 
posting. Neither you nor a special process server can 
serve a Defendant this way. 
o  At the court date, bring with you: 

•  Any earlier Affidavits of Service of Eviction 

Summons & Eviction Complaint showing the 
Defendants could not be personally served; 

•  The Affidavit for Service by Posting;

want the judge to see. Be prepared to explain why 
the pictures or documents are important. Bring the 
original for the judge and copies for you and the 
Defendants. 

o  Talk to anyone who you want as a witness and ask 
them to come to the court date with you. Decide and 
write down the questions you will ask the witnesses 
at the court date. 

o  Decide and write down what you will say to the 
judge if asked to tell your side of the case. 

o to your court date. 

  G

o  Bring these items with you to court: 

•  A copy of the Eviction Complaint and Eviction 

Summons; 

•  Proof that the Eviction Summons and Eviction 
Complaint were served on the Defendants; 

•  a copy of the Notice or Demand (if any); 
•  Affidavit of Proof of Service of a Demand or 

Notice; 

•  The written lease if your Eviction Complaint is 
based on a lease violation, other than non-
payment of rent; 

•  Affidavit – Supporting Documents Not Attached 
to Complaint if you do not have a Notice, 
Demand, or Affidavit of Service of a Demand or 
Notice; 

• 

• 

If you are evicting the Defendants for 
nonpayment of rent, bring a copy of your rent 
ledger, receipt book, and any other documents 
to show how much the Defendants owe; 

If you are evicting the Defendants for a lease 
violation other than nonpayment of rent, bring 
any documents, photographs, or other evidence 
showing that the Defendants committed the 
lease violation; AND 

•  Any other evidence or witnesses that you feel 

may be important to your case. 

o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 

form.  

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 

o 

o 

•  The Notice by Posting Requiring Appearance in 

Pending Eviction Action; and 

•  The sheriff’s posting affidavit, if available. 
If the judge agrees you did what you reasonably 
could to try to serve the Defendants in person and 
that you followed the service by posting rules, then 
they will proceed with the eviction case. The judge 
may decide to have a trial immediately, or may 
schedule a new trial date. After you serve the 
Defendants by posting, prepare for trial before you 
come to court. 
If you serve the Defendants by posting, you will be 
able to get an Eviction Order if you prove your case 
in court. However, you will not be able to get a 
money judgment against the Defendants unless the 
judge decides they have “personal jurisdiction” over 
them. Talk to a lawyer about how a judge gets 
personal jurisdiction over Defendants.  
 

How do I confirm the sheriff served the forms on the 
other party?  
o  After the sheriff serves the other party with your 

court forms, they will fill out the Affidavit of Service of 
Eviction Summons & Eviction Complaint section of 
your Eviction Summons form and file it with the 
Circuit Clerk OR mail it to you.  
• 

If the sheriff files the Eviction Summons with the 
completed Affidavit of Service of Eviction 
Summons & Eviction Complaint directly with the 
Circuit Clerk, call the Circuit Clerk to find out if it 
has been filed. If it has been filed, ask the Circuit 
Clerk how to get a copy.  

• 

If the sheriff mails the Eviction Summons with 
the completed Affidavit of Service of Eviction 
Summons & Eviction Complaint to you, e-file the 
Affidavit of Service of Eviction Summons & 
Eviction Complaint. If you have an e-filing 
exemption, make a copy for yourself and file the 
Affidavit of Service of Eviction Summons & 
Eviction Complaint with the Circuit Clerk  and 
have the Circuit Clerk stamp your copy. 
 

STEP 4: GO TO COURT 

name and case number to be 
called. 
o When your case is called, 
approach the bench (which is 
where the judge sits), introduce 
yourself and give the Defendants 
an opportunity to introduce 
themselves. 

     

Make sure you know how you are 
to attend your court date. 
Your court date could be in person, by 
phone or by video. If it is by phone or video 
it is called a “Remote Appearance.” Call the 
Circuit Clerk or visit their website for more 
information. To find the phone number for

not move by that time, you may contact the sheriff 
(see Step 5). ONLY THE SHERIFF MAY EVICT 
THE DEFENDANTS!  
If the judge rules against you, the judge will dismiss 
your case. 
 

STEP 5: ENFORCE THE 
EVICTION ORDER 

ow do I get the sheriff to evict the tenants? 
After court, you must take the Eviction Order to the 
sheriff’s office. You may need to fill out extra forms, 
make copies, get certified copies, and/or pay fees.  
o  You will need to ask your sheriff’s office what their 

process is for:  
• 

telling you when they will come to do the eviction 
(because you or someone on your behalf must 
be at the property when the sheriff goes out);  

•  having the locks changed; 
• 

removing any personal property from the unit; 
AND  

•  any other requirements.  
If you do not follow your sheriff’s office procedures, it 
could delay the eviction.  
If you have an Order for Waiver of Court Fees, all or 
a portion of any fee the sheriff charges will be 
waived. Give a copy of your Order to the sheriff.   

ow do I get the tenants to pay the money 

judgment? 
If the tenant does not pay you the money listed on the 
Eviction Order, you may have to go back to court to try 
to collect the money. For more information see: 
illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/collecting-judgment.

If your court date is by phone or video: 
•  Make sure to have the call-in or login information 

for your court date and make sure your 
technology is working. 

•  Follow the instructions on the court notice you 
received. Call the Circuit Clerk or Circuit Court 
or visit their websites for specific technology 
instructions. 

•  Follow these recommendations to appear by 

phone or video: illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/court-

Will my case go to trial on the first court date?  
o 

It may, but the judge may continue the case for any 
number of reasons, such as: 
•  You cannot show you properly served the 

Eviction Summons; 

•  The Defendants may ask for time to get a 

lawyer; 

•  The Defendants may file a jury demand (asking 

that the case be decided by a jury instead of a 
judge); OR 

•  The judge may grant either party more time to 

gather necessary evidence. For more 
information about how to get evidence, including 
from the other side, see illinoislegalaid.org/legal-
information/using-discovery-lawsuit.  

hat happens during the trial? 

o  You will be placed under oath. You will have a 
chance to tell the judge your side of the case.  

o  The Defendants can question you and your 

witnesses. 

o  The Defendants then have the chance to tell the 

judge their side of the case.  

o  You can question the Defendants and their 

witnesses.  

o  You and the Defendants can show documents to the 
judge. The judge will decide what evidence will be 
used to decide the case. 

hat happens after both sides present their case? 
o  The judge will make a decision and enter an order.  
If the judge needs more information to make a 
o 
decision, the judge may continue the case to a later 
date. If the judge wants more information, write 
down what is needed and bring it with you to the 
next court date. 
If the judge has enough information to make a 
decision, they will enter an order. 
If the judge rules in your favor, the order will give 
you possession of your property. The order may also 
award you the rent due, court costs, and attorneys’ 
fees. The order will give a date and time by which 
the Defendants must move out. If the Defendants do
