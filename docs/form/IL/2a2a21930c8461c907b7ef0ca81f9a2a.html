HOW TO ASK THE SUPREME COURT TO PARTICIPATE 
 
 
IN AN APPEAL FOR FREE OR AT A REDUCED COST 
 
NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
All the Supreme Court Rules mentioned in these 
instructions can be found at: 
illinoiscourts.gov/rules/supreme-court-rules. 
 

 
Is there a deadline for filing an Application for 
 
Waiver of Court Fees? 
o  At the time you file your first document with the 
 
Supreme Court, you must file a completed 
 
Application for Waiver of Court Fees. 
 
It might take the Supreme Court a couple of weeks 
to review your application and decide whether you 
 
have to pay the Supreme Court fees, so do not wait 
 
until the last minute. 

o  You are responsible for knowing if there are other 
 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
deadlines to file documents. 

 

 

 

 
 
How do I prove I cannot afford to pay court fees? 
The Supreme Court may require you to prove the 
 
information in your Application. If you get public benefits, 
 
you may be asked to provide documents showing you 
 
receive public benefits, such as a benefits statement 
 
 
from the agency providing the benefit. 
 
Examples of public benefits are: 
o  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (Not Social 
 
 

 

 

 

 

Security) 
 

 

o  Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD) 
  
 
o  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) 
  
 
o  Food Stamps (SNAP) 
 
 
o  General Assistance (GA),Transitional Assistance, or 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State Children & Family Assistance 
  
 

If you don't get public benefits, you may be asked to 
provide documents showing your income, value of 
 
belongings (for example, real estate), and expenses. 
 
 
What happens if my Application is granted? 
  
Depending upon your circumstances, the Supreme 
Court may order that: 
 
o  You may participate for free; 
 
 
o  You must pay 25% of any fee charged; 
 
 
o  You must pay 50% of any fee charged; OR 
 
 
o  You must pay 75% of any fee charged. 
 
 
 
If my Application is granted, will I ever have to pay 
 
fees? 
 
o 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

If the Supreme Court grants your Application and 
later decides that the information you put in your 
 
Application was incorrect and you were ineligible, 
 
the Court can make you pay back any fees that were 
waived. 
 
If the Supreme Court believes that your financial 
 
situation has changed and you are no longer eligible 
for a full or partial fee waiver, the Court may ask you 
to provide documents showing you are still eligible. 
 
If the Supreme Court decides you do not have to 
pay all or some of the court fees and you win your 
 
case and get money from the other side, the Court 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
  

 
Who can ask the court to participate in an appeal for 
 
free? 
Anyone who must pay as part of a Supreme Court case. 
You can ask for yourself, your minor child, or an 
 
incompetent adult, but not for anyone else. NOTE: this 
 
 
form cannot be used to waive fees charged in the trial or 
appellate court.  
 
 
How will I know if there is a fee? 
 
The Supreme Court Clerk can tell you if there is a fee for 
filing a document with the court.  Supreme Court Rule 
313 requires the person who files an appeal to pay a $50 
  
fee.  Rule 313 requires all other parties to pay a $30 fee. 
 
 
What form do I need to fill out to ask the Supreme
Court to let me participate in an appeal for free or at 
 
a reduced cost? 
o  Application for Waiver of Court Fees (Supreme 
 
 
 
Court) is used to tell the court whether you get any 
public benefits and your income and expense 
information so it can decide if you can participate in 
 
an appeal for free or at a reduced cost. The email 
address (if you have one) and mailing address you 
 
 
put on the (Form Name) is where important legal 
 
documents will be sent to you. You should use an 
email account that you do not share with anyone 
 
else and that you check every day. If you do not 
 
check your email every day, you may miss important 
 
information, notice of court dates, or documents from 
 
other parties. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Where can I find the form I need? 
o  You can find the forms online at: 
 
 

 

illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
 
forms. 

o  You can also ask the Supreme Court Clerk for a 
 

 

 
Do I have to pay a fee to file an Application for 
 
Waiver of Court Fees (Supreme Court)? 
o  No, there is no cost for filing an Application for 
 
 
 
 
Waiver of Court Fees.

o  The Supreme Court may need more information 
 
 

 
from you. The Supreme Court Clerk will notify you if 
 
you need to give more information. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  After the court makes a decision, the Supreme Court 
 
 
Clerk will notify you whether the fee was waived or is 
 
now due, and mail or email you a copy of the official 
 
 
 
notice of order. 
 
 
 
If the court decides you have to pay all or some of 
 
the court fees, you have to pay by the deadline set 
 
by the Supreme Court. If you do not pay by the 
deadline, the Supreme Court may dismiss your 
 
case. 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may make you use all or part of this money to pay 
 
 
the court fees. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
When does my fee waiver expire? 
 
It is good for one year. If you still need the fee waiver 
 
after it expires, you will need to file a new Application. 
 
However, this does not mean you have to pay back fees 
 
that were already waived. 
  
 
What do I do after I fill out the Application for Waiver 
 
of Court Fees form? 
 
Step 1: File your Application with the Supreme 
 
Court. 
 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
 
 
 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  
•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
  
available. 

 

 

 

 

 

• 
 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
  
forms/approved-forms. 

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your forms and 
 
 

 

 

 

 

the Certification with the trial court clerk’s office 
 
in person or by mail. 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

 

 
 

 

  
provider. 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: 
https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/self-
help/resources-for-srls-in-civil-appeals. 
 
If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, bring your form to the trial court 
 
clerk's office or appellate court clerk's office where 
you can use a public computer terminal to e-file your 
 
form. 
  
•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

 

 

a flash drive. 
  

o 
 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

 

 

 

that you can use to e-file your form. 
  

 

 

 

 
Step 2: Wait for a decision. 
 
o  The Supreme Court will review your Application for 
 
 
Waiver of Court Fees and decide whether you have 
to pay the Supreme Court fees.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
