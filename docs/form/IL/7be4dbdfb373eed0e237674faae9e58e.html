      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>  o  Provide the name of the trial court case.  If the case 
was given a name beginning with “In re” (e.g., “In re 
Marriage of Jones”), enter that name.  Then, enter the 
names of the plaintiff/petitioner (the party who filed the 
trial court case) and the defendant/respondent (the 
party against whom the case was filed).  Finally, show 
which party is the appellant (the party who filed the 
appeal) and which party is the appellee (the party 
responding to the appeal). 

o  Enter the trial court county, case number, and judge’s 

name. 

o  Enter your name, address, and phone number.  You 
may also enter your email address, but, if you do, the 
court may use it to send you important 
documents.  Therefore, you should enter your email 
address only if you check your email frequently.

commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS), or 
through the court's electronic filing manager or an 
approved e-filing service provider. You may send your 
Petition to a party by e-mail if they have listed their e-
mail address on a court document. Complete the 
Proof of Service with information to show how you 
sent your Petition to each party. The Proof of Service 
has room for 3 parties. If you are sending your Petition 
to more than 3 parties, fill out and insert one or more 
Additional Proof of Service forms into the main form.

HOW TO FILE A PETITION FOR REHEARING 

NOTE: Before ruling on your Petition for Rehearing, the 
appellate court may send you a notice to appear for oral 
argument.  However, oral argument on a Petition for 
Rehearing is extremely rare. 

 

 

   

     

Step 2: File your Petition with the appellate court. 
o 

If you are an inmate in a prison or jail and don’t have 
a lawyer, you may file your Petition by mail. 
Otherwise, you must electronically file (e-file) your 
Petition. If you are unable to e-file, you can ask the 
court for permission to file in person, by mail, or by 
third-party commercial carrier. To ask the court for 
approval to file this way, you can use the Appellate 
Motion form found here: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/default.
asp. You must have a good reason that prevents you 
from e-filing. 

o 

o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
provider. Visit http://efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-
providers.htm to select a service provider. Some are 
free, while others charge a processing fee. For 
instructions on how to e-file for free with Odyssey 
eFileIL, see Odyssey File & Serve: Individual Filer 
User Guide here: 
https://tylertech.egain.cloud/kb/ilh5/content/PROD-
16579/HTML-5-Individual-Filer-User-Guide-20170 
If you do not have access to a computer, or if you 
need additional help, you may take your Petition to 
the appellate court clerk’s office, where you can use 
a public terminal to e-file your Petition. You can bring 
your Petition on a flash drive or on paper. The 
terminal will have a scanner and computer where you 
can scan, save, and e-file your Petition. To locate the 
clerk of the appellate court district where your appeal 
has been filed, click here:  
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/AppellateCourt/ClerksDef
ault.asp 
 

tep 3: Wait for a ruling by the appellate court.  

The appellate court will do one of the following: 
o  Deny your Petition for Rehearing.  If the appellate 

court sees no merit in your Petition for Rehearing, the 
court will deny it.  The denial could take the form of a 
modified decision, which will reach the same result, 
or a separate order. 

o  Grant your Petition for Rehearing.  If the appellate 
court sees merit in your Petition for Rehearing, the 
court will grant it.  The court will give your opponent 
21 days to file an answer, and it will give you 14 days 
to file, if you wish, a reply to your opponent’s answer.  
The appellate court will then issue a new decision.  
However, the grant of a Petition for Rehearing does 
not guarantee that the new decision will reach a 
different result. 

o  Request an answer from your opponent without 

granting your Petition for Rehearing.  If the appellate 
court sees possible merit in your Petition for 
Rehearing, it will give your opponent 21 days to file 
an answer, and it will give you 14 days to file, if you  
wish, a reply to your opponent’s answer.  The 
appellate court will then either deny your Petition for 
Rehearing or grant it and issue a new decision.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
