HOW TO ASK THE COURT TO DELAY A 
FORECLOSURE SALE 

How do I present my case to the judge? 
Step 1: Tell the judge your side of the case and answer 
questions. 
o  Bring any important documents relating to your 

foreclosure including documents mentioned above. 
•  Give a copy to the judge and a copy to the other 

parties. Be prepared to explain why the document is 
important. 

o  The judge decides what materials can be considered in 

making a decision about your case.   

tep 2: What do I do when the other parties present 

their case? 
o  The other parties will also get to present their case. 
o  Write down your questions while they are speaking to 

the judge.  

tep 3: What happens after both sides present their 

case? 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 

called a court order.  
If the judge needs more information to make a decision, 
the judge may set up another court date. Make sure you 
understand what information is needed and get it before 
the new court date.  
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge may 
let you know the decision later by mailing a court order 
or at another court date.   
If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
decide right then and fill out a court order.  
•  Get a copy of the order that has the court stamp on 

it. 

If the other party was not in court to get a copy, you must 
send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the date you get the 
order. Fill out and file a Proof of Delivery court form with the 
Circuit Clerk to show that you sent the copy. You may find 
the Proof of Delivery at: 
http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/. 

  S

  S

o 

o 

o 

o  Check with court staff to see if you need to deliver 

another copy to the judge's office.  

o  You must send your copies by 5:00 p.m. on the date 
you file your forms even if you are filing by mail or 
online.  

o  Keep one copy of the forms that were stamped by 

the Circuit Clerk for your own records. 

o 

tep 3: Ask for a court date.  
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically.  
If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
with other court staff.  
If you need to have your motion heard soon 
because of an upcoming sale date, let the court 
know this.  

o 

o  When you get your court date, ask if the court will 

send notice of the court date to the other parties or if 
you need to. 

o  Enter the date and time in section 1 of the Notice of 

Motion to Stay a Foreclosure Sale.  

tep 4: Get ready for your court date. 
o  Decide and write down: 

•  What you want to ask the judge to do for you; 

AND 

•  What you will say to the judge if asked to tell 

your side of the case. 

o  Gather and make copies of pictures and documents 
you want the judge to see. Bring the original for the 
judge and one copy for you and each of the people 
in the case. 

tep 5: Go to your court date. 
o  Bring these items with you to court: 

•  A copy of the Mortgage Foreclosure Complaint 

and Summons; 

•  Two copies of your completed and stamped 

Motion to Stay Foreclosure Sale and Notice of 
Motion to Stay a Foreclosure Sale; 
•  Order to Stay Foreclosure Sale; AND 
•  Other papers related to your mortgage or home 
such as: proof of your payment history, loan 
modification packet, information from a housing 
counselor, real estate sale contract, proof of 
employment or other income. 

o  Get to the courthouse at least 30 minutes early. 
o  Go to the courtroom number listed on your court 

form. If your forms do not have a courtroom number 
look for a list of cases at the courthouse or ask the 
Circuit Clerk.   

o  Check in with the courtroom staff and wait for your 

name and case number to be called. 

o  When your case is called, walk to the judge and 

introduce yourself and briefly tell the judge what you 
are asking for. The judge will let you know what will 
happen next.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
