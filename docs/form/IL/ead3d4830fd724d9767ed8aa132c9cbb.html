were given the proper notices about the default on the mortgage. 

• 

Illinois law says that when the Plaintiff uses a Foreclosure Complaint to sue you, facts such as notices are part of 
the complaint, even if these facts are not listed in the complaint. 
 

   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you have defenses to the foreclosure - such as not being given the required notices - then list them in C below.

In B, enter the number

paragraph and 
subparagraph in the 
 
Complaint. 
  
Then check “Agree,”

know if all of the 
 
statements in the

deny the statements.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
