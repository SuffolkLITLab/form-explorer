      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>o 
 

It might take the judge a couple of days to review 
 
your application and to decide whether you have to 
pay fees, so don’t wait until the last minute. 
 

 

o  You are responsible for knowing if there are other 

 

deadlines to file documents. 
 

 

 
How do I prove I cannot afford to pay court fees? 
 
The  judge  may  require  you  to  prove  the  information  in 
 
your Application. If you get public benefits you may want 
to bring proof of current eligibility and benefits statement 
from the agency providing the benefit. 
 
Examples of public benefits are: 
 
o  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (Not Social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Security) 
 

 

 

o  Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD) 
 
 
o  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) 
o  SNAP (Food Stamps) 
 
o  General Assistance (GA), Transitional Assistance, or 
  

 
 

 

 

State Children & Family Assistance 
  

 

 

 

 

If you do not get public benefits, you may want to bring 
documents showing your income, value of belongings 
(for example, real estate), and expenses. 
 
 
What happens if my Application is granted? 
 
Depending upon your circumstances, the judge may 
 
order that: 
 
o  You may participate for free; 
 
o  You must pay 25% of any fee charged; 
 
o  You must pay 50% of any fee charged; OR 
 
o  You must pay 75% of any fee charged. 
 
 
If my Application is granted, will I ever have to pay 
fees? 
 
o 
 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

   

If the judge grants your Application and later decides 
that the information you put in your Application was 
 
incorrect and you were ineligible, the judge can 
make you pay back any fees that were waived. 
 
If the court believes that your financial situation has 
changed and you are no longer eligible for a full or 
 
partial fee waiver, the court can hold a hearing to 
decide whether you are still eligible. If you are no 
longer eligible, you will have to pay future fees. 
 
If the court decides you do not have to pay all or 
some of the court fees and you win your case and 
get money from the other side, the court may make 
 
you use all or part of this money to pay the court 
fees.

instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at

about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
Who can ask the judge to participate in a court case 
 
for free or at a reduced cost? 
 
Anyone who must pay a fee as part of a court case. You 
can ask for yourself, your minor child, or an incompetent 
adult, but not for anyone else. 
 
 
How will I know if there is a fee? 
 
The Circuit Clerk can tell you if there is a fee for filing a 
document with the court. Other fees might come up 
during the case. For example, the judge might tell you 
about a fee or the sheriff’s department might tell you 
 
about a fee for delivering (serving) court papers. 
 
 
What forms do I need to fill out? 
 
 
o  Application for Waiver of Court Fees: Is used to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell the judge whether you get any public benefits 
and your income and expense information so they 
 
can decide if you can participate in a court case for 
 
free or at a reduced cost. The email address (if you 
 
have one) and mailing address you put on the 
Application is where important legal documents will 
be sent to you. You should use an email account 
that you do not share with anyone else and that you 
check every day. If you do not check your email 
every day, you may miss important information, 
notice of court dates, or documents from other 
 
parties. 
 

 

 

 

o  Order for Waiver of Court Fees: Is used by the 

 

judge to say your application is granted or denied. 
 

 
Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
 
forms/approved-forms. 
 
 
Do I have to pay to file an Application for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees? 
 
No, there is no cost for filing an Application for Waiver of 
 
Court Fees. 
 
 
Is there a deadline for filing an Application for 
Waiver of Court Fees? 
 
o  No. You can file an Application for Waiver of Court 

 

Fees at any time during the court case.

HOW TO ASK THE JUDGE TO PARTICIPATE IN A 
COURT CASE FOR FREE OR AT A REDUCED COST 
 

 

o  The judge may need more information from you. The 

 

 

 

judge may want to have a hearing on your 
Application. The judge will notify you if you need to 
give more information or documents, or if you have 
 
to go to court. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

o  Your court date could be in person, by phone, or by 
video. If it is by phone or video it is called a “Remote 
Appearance.” Call the Circuit Clerk or visit their 
 
website for more information. To find the phone 
 
number for your Circuit Clerk, visit 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

o  After the judge decides, they will fill out the Order for 
Waiver of Court Fees. This Order will say if you have 
 
to pay any court fees. 
 

o  The judge or the Circuit Clerk will tell you: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  How you will get a copy of the Order for Waiver 
 

 

•  When you will get a copy of the Order for Waiver 
 

 

of Court Fees. 
 
 

of Court Fees. 
 
 

 

If the judge decides you have to pay all or some of 
 
the court fees, you have to pay by the deadline set 
in the Order for Waiver of Court Fees. If you do not 
pay by the deadline, the judge may dismiss your 
case or find against you. 
 

 

 

 

o 
 

 

 

When does my fee waiver expire? 
 
It is good for one year. If you still need the fee waiver 
 
after it expires, you will need to file a new Application. 
 
However, this does not mean you have to pay back fees 
 
that were already waived. 
 

 

 

 

What do I do after I fill out the Application for Waiver 
of Court Fees and Order for Waiver of Court Fees? 
 
Step 1: File your Application for Waiver of Court 
Fees and Order for Waiver of Court Fees with the 
Circuit Clerk in the county where your court case 
was filed. 
  
 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  

 

 

 

 

•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
available. 
  

 
• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms 
 

 

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your form and the 
 
Certification with the Circuit Clerk’s office in 
person or by mail. 
 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

 

 

 

provider. 
 
 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 

to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
 
help/how-to-e-file/. 

o 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your forms. 
  

 

•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

a flash drive. 
 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

that you can use to e-file your form. 
 

 

 

Step 2: Wait for a decision. 
 
o  The judge will review your Application for Waiver of 
 
 
Court Fees and decide whether you have to pay the 
 
court fees.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
