      <pre>HOW TO FILE & SEND A MOTION 
  
& NOTICE OF COURT DATE FOR MOTION 
 

 

 

NOTE: If there are any words or terms used in these 
 
instructions that you do not understand, please visit 
Illinois Legal Aid Online at 
 
illinoislegalaid.org/lexicon/glossary. For more information 
about going to court including how to fill out and file 
forms, call or text Illinois Court Help at 833-411-1121 or 
 
go to ilcourthelp.gov. 
 
 
Who can file a Motion? 
 
Any person who is involved in a court case and wants to 
ask the judge to do something can file a Motion. For 
example, you might file a Motion to: schedule a new 
 
court date, ask for more time to move in an eviction, 
change an earlier order, or to explain why you missed 
court so you can ask for a new court date. 
 
 
What forms do I need to fill out? 
 
o  Motion: use this form to explain what you want the 
judge to do and any reasons why the judge should 
say yes to your request. The email address (if you 
 
have one) and mailing address you put on the 
Motion is where important legal documents will be 
sent to you. You should use an email account that 
 
you do not share with anyone else and that you 
check every day. If you do not check your email 
every day, you may miss important information, 
notice of court dates, or documents from other 
 
parties. 
 
 

o  Order: is used by the judge to say if your Motion is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

granted or denied. 
 

o  Notice of Court Date for Motion: use this form to 

 

 

schedule the court date when you will see the judge. 
 
This form also: 
 

•  Lists the date, time, and place where you will 
 

see the judge; 
 

•  Lists the names and addresses of the other 
 
 
parties or the names and addresses of their 
lawyers; AND 
 

•  Lets the other parties in the case know about the 
 

court date. 
 
 

 

Where can I find the forms I need? 
 
You can find the forms at: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-
and-forms/approved-forms. 
 
 
Are there any costs to file a Motion? 
 
o  Some Motions require a filing fee but there are many 
 
Motions where the filing is free. 

  

 

 

o  The Circuit Clerk will let you know if there is a fee for 

 

your Motion. Also, many courts have the court fees 
 
listed on their websites. 
 

o 
 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask 
the court to file for free or at a reduced cost by filing 
an Application for Waiver of Court Fees found at 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-forms/approved-
forms. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
What do I do after I fill out my forms? 
 
Step 1: File your Motion forms with the Circuit Clerk 
in the county where the court case is filed. 
o  You must electronically file (e-file) court documents 
unless (1) you are an inmate in a prison or jail and 
you do not have a lawyer, (2) you have a disability 
that keeps you from e-filing, or (3) you qualify for an 
exemption from e-filing. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

•  You will qualify for an exemption if: (1) you do 
 
not have internet or computer access at home 
and it would be difficult for you to travel to a 
place where you could use a computer; (2) you 
have trouble reading or speaking in English, or 
 
(3) you tried to e-file your documents, but you 
were unable to complete the process because 
 
the equipment or assistance you need is not 
available. 
  

 
• 

If you qualify for an exemption, fill out a 
Certification for Exemption from E-Filing found 
here: illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms. 

 

 

 

 

•  File the original and 1 copy of your Motion and 
 
the Certification with the Circuit Clerk’s office in 
person or by mail. 
 
o  To e-file, create an account with an e-filing service 
 

 

 

 

 

provider. 
 
 
•  Visit efile.illinoiscourts.gov/service-providers.htm 
 
to select a service provider. Some service 
providers are free while others charge a 
processing fee. For instructions on how to e-file 
for free with Odyssey eFileIL, see the self-help 
 
user guides here: illinoiscourts.gov/self-
help/how-to-e-file/. 
 

o 
 

If you do not have access to a computer or if you 
need help e-filing, take your forms to the Circuit 
 
Clerk’s office where you can use a public computer 
 
terminal to e-file your forms. 
  

 

 

•  You can bring your forms on paper or saved on 
 

a flash drive. 
 

•  The terminal will have a scanner and computer 
 
 

that you can use to e-file your form. 
 

 
Step 2: Ask for a court date. 
 
o  Ask the Circuit Clerk if you have to schedule a court 
date or if one will be scheduled automatically.

o 
 

If your court date is by phone or video: 
 

•  Make sure to have the call-in or login information 
 

for your court date and make sure your 
technology is working. 
 

 

 

•  Follow the instructions on the court notice you 
 
 
received. Call the Circuit Clerk or Circuit Court 
or visit their websites for specific technology 
 
instructions. 
 

 

 

 

•  Follow these recommendations to appear by 
 
 

 

phone or video: illinoiscourts.gov/self-help/court-
by-phone-or-video. 
 
 

o  Have these items with you on  your court date: 
 

  

 

•  Photo I.D.; 
 
 

•  Copies of all the documents you filed with 
 

the Circuit Clerk; 
 

•  Copy of your Order; and 
 
 

•  Other papers or proof related to your Motion. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

   

o  Arrive for your court date at least 15 minutes early. If 
you are going in person to court, add more time for 
going through security. 
 

 

o 
 

If your hearing is in person, find the courtroom 
number listed on your court forms. If your forms do 
not have a courtroom number look for a list of cases 
at the courthouse or ask the Circuit 
Clerk.

 

 

 

o 
 

If you need to schedule the court date, ask the 
Circuit Clerk how to do so. The Circuit Clerk may 
 
schedule the court date or you may have to speak 
with other court staff. 
 
 
o  When you get your court date, ask if the court will 

 

 

send notice of the court date to the other party or if 
 
you need to. 
 
If you need to send notice, complete the Notice of 
 
Court Date for Motion. 
 

 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 3: Send a copy of your Motion forms to the 
other party. 
  
o  You must send your forms to the other parties in the 

 
case. If a party has a lawyer, send the forms to the 
lawyer. 
 
If you and the person you're sending the (form) to 
have an email address, you must send it by email or 
 
by notification through the e-filing system. If you or 
the person you’re sending the (form) to does not 
have an email address, you may give it to the other 
parties by personal hand delivery, mail, or third-party 
commercial carrier (for example, FedEx or UPS). 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Step 4: Get ready for your court date. 
 
o  Decide and write down: 
 
•  What you want to 
 
 

 

ask the judge to 
do for you; 
 

•  What you will say 
 
 
to the judge if 
 
asked to tell your 
side of the case; 
AND 
 

•  Questions you 
 
have for 
 
witnesses, if there 
are any. 
 

Make sure you know how you are to 
attend your court date. 
 
Your court date could be in person, by phone or by 
 
video. If it is by phone or video it is called a 
“Remote Appearance.” Call the Circuit Clerk or visit 
their website for more information. To find the 
phone number for your Circuit Clerk, visit 
 
 
illinoiscourts.gov/courts/circuit-court/circuit-court-
clerks/. 
 

 

 

 

o  You may need to check in with 
the courtroom staff. Then, wait for 
your name and case number to be 
called. 
  

 

 

 

o  When your case is called, 
introduce yourself to the judge. If 
you are attending by phone or 
video, remember to unmute 
yourself. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Gather and make copies of pictures and documents 
you want the judge to see. Bring the original for the 
judge and one copy for you and each of the people 
 
in the case. If your court date is by phone or video, 
contact the Circuit Clerk and ask how you can get a 
copy of these items to the judge. You might have to 
e-file them like your other documents. You will also 
 
have to get a copy of these items to the other 
parties. 
 
If you want the judge to hear from other people, 
those people will have to attend court and be 
witnesses (in most cases, you cannot bring in written 
statements of witnesses). If your court date is by 
 
 
phone or video, you will have to arrange for your 
witnesses to attend by phone or video. 
 
 

o 
 

 

 

 

Step 5: Attend your court date. 
 
o  You must attend the court date if one is scheduled. If 

 

 

you do not, the judge could enter an order or 
 
 
judgment against you. 
 

 

How do I present my case to the judge and what 
happens after? 
 
Step 1: Tell the judge your side of the case and 
answer questions. 
 
o  Show evidence including documents and photos. 
 

 

 

•  Give a copy to the judge and a copy to the other 
 
party. Be prepared to explain why the document 
or photo is important. 
 
o  Question your witnesses. 
 

 

•  Tell the judge the name of your witnesses. 
 

 

•  Ask the witnesses questions you prepared in 
 

advance. 
 

•  The judge and the other party can ask questions 
 

 

 

of your witnesses when you are done. 
 
o  The judge decides whether the documents, photos, 
or witness testimony can be considered in making a 
 
decision about your case.

Step 2: The other party presents their case. 
 
o  The other party will also get to present their case by 

 

testifying, giving the judge evidence, and 
questioning witnesses. 
 
 
o  You will get to see any documents and photos the 

 

other party brings to court. If you do not think the 
judge should consider them in making a decision 
about your case, tell the judge why. 
 

 

 

o  You may ask questions of the other party’s 
 

 

witnesses. Write down your questions while they are 
 
speaking to the other party or judge. 
 

 

Step 3: The judge makes a decision after both sides 
present their case. 
 
o  The judge has to make a decision. The decision is 

 

o 
 

o 
 

o 
 

called a court order. 
 
If the judge needs more information to make a 
decision, the judge may set up another court date. 
Make sure you understand what information is 
needed and get it before the new court date. 
 
If the judge needs to think about it more, the judge 
 
may let you know the decision later by sending a 
court order or at another court date. 
If the judge has enough information, the judge may 
decide right then and fill out a court order. 
 

  

 

 

•  Get a copy of the order that has the court stamp 
 

on it. 
  

 
• 

If the other party was not in court to get a copy, 
you must send them a copy by 5:00 p.m. on the 
date you get the order. Fill out and file a Proof of 
Delivery court form with the Circuit Clerk to show 
that you sent the copy. You may find the Proof 
of Delivery at illinoiscourts.gov/documents-and-
forms/approved-forms.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
