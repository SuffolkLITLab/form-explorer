filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.    Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.   If you choose 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule 
of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you

circumstances.    You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Rules  of 
Judicial  Administration.    If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or 
receiving  pleadings  by  electronic mail  (e-mail), or  through  the  Florida  Courts E-Filing  Portal,  you  must 
review Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
