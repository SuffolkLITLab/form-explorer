intended  that  it  be  accorded  full  faith  and  credit  by  the  court  of  another  state  or  Indian  tribe  and 
enforced as if it were the order of the enforcing state or of the Indian tribe.

a.  

Obligor  shall  pay  any  temporary  court-ordered  child  support/alimony  through  income 
deduction, and such support shall be paid to either the State Disbursement Unit or the 
central depository.  Obligor is individually responsible for paying this support obligation 
in the event that all or any portion of said support is not deducted from Obligor’s income.  
Obligor shall also pay any service charge required by statute.  Until child support/alimony 
payments  are  deducted  from  Obligor’s  paycheck  pursuant  to  the  Income  Deduction 
Order,  Obligor  is  responsible  for  making  timely  payments  directly  to  either  the  State 
Disbursement Unit or the central depository.
