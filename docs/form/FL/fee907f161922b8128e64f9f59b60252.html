      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW
 
 
FORM 12.904(b),
 
  
PETITION FOR SUPPORT UNCONNECTED WITH DISSOLUTION OF
 
 
MARRIAGE WITH NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN)
 
 
(02/18)
 
 
 
When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
This form may be used if a dissolution of marriage has not been filed, and you are requesting alimony.  If 
a  petition  for  dissolution  has  been  filed,  you  should  file  a  Motion  for  Temporary  Support  with  No 
 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c), instead of 
 
using this petition.  Also, if you are requesting that an order be entered for you to pay support to your 
 
 
spouse, you should not file this form. 
 
 
This petition does not address the issues of property or debts.  It only deals with alimony. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
 
 
 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records. Because you are filing the petition in this 
 
 
 
proceeding, you are referred to as the petitioner and your spouse as the respondent. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 
 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition.  Because this petition 
concerns alimony, you should use personal service. 
 
United States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for example, Memorandum for 
 
Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a) and 
Affidavit of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(b).  Service on a 
 
 
spouse who is in the military can be complicated; therefore, you may wish to consult an attorney 
 
regarding this issue. 

 
If your spouse is in the military service of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Your spouse has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition.  Your case will then generally 
proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 
 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.904(b), Petition for Support Unconnected 
 
with Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren)  (02/18) 

 

     

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

DEFAULT. If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed all of the 
required papers, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final 
 
hearing.  You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
UNCONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer 
and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you 
 
 
may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify 
 
your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED. If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or 
denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a 
Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with 
 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of 
mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, 
or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If your spouse files 
an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer 
 
to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
  
beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. 
For further information, see section 61.09, Florida Statutes. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
 
Administration. 
If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
   
 
pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida 
 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the 
 
 
Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court 
 
in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form

Special notes... 
 

   

 

 

 
 
If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of 
 
Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to 
 
have filing fees deferred. 
 
 
With this form you must also file the following: 
 
 
  Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(j). 
 
 
 

Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c).  (This 
 
must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of 
 
the petition.) 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 

 

 

 

12.932.  (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on the respondent, if not filed at 
the time of the petition, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these 
 
documents.) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

Alimony. Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that one spouse has an actual need for 
it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay.  If you want alimony, you must request it in writing 
 
 
 
 
in the original petition.  If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived 
 
 
(you may not request it later).  You may request permanent alimony, bridge-the-gap alimony, 
 
durational alimony, and/or rehabilitative alimony. If alimony is awarded, the judge may order periodic 
 
payments, payments in lump sum, or both. 
 
 
Temporary Relief. If you need temporary relief regarding alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary 
 
Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.947(c).  For more information, see the instructions for that form. 
 
 
 
Final Judgment Forms. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Support Unconnected with 
Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
Family Law Form 12.994(b), which the judge may use if your case is contested. You should check with 
the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with 
you to the hearing.  If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case 
number, division, and the parties’ names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your 
hearing or trial. 
 
 
Nonlawyer. Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you 
 
fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family 
 
 
Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out 
 
these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last 
page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
