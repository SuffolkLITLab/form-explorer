INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE 
  
FORM 12.930(a) 
 
NOTICE OF SERVICE OF STANDARD FAMILY LAW INTERROGATORIES 
  
 
(10/21) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  
 

You should use this form to tell the court that you are asking the other party in your case to answer 
 
 
certain standard questions in writing.  These questions are called interrogatories, and they must relate 
 
to your case. The standard family law interrogatories are designed to supplement the information 
 
provided in the Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). You 
 
 
should carefully read the standard interrogatory forms, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
12.930(b) and (c), to determine which questions, if any, the other party needs to answer in order to 
 
 
 
 
provide you with information not covered by the financial affidavit forms. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. You must indicate whether you are sending the 
 
 
interrogatories for original and enforcement proceedings or the interrogatories for modification 
 
proceedings. You must also indicate which questions you are asking the other party to answer.  After 
  
 
completing this form you should file this document with the clerk of the circuit court in the county 
 
 
 
where your case was filed and keep a copy for your records. 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You must serve the other party with a copy of this form along with an original and a copy of the 
 
appropriate interrogatories, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(b) or (c), if service is by 
 
 
 
mail or hand delivery.  You must serve a copy of this form and a copy of the interrogatories if service is 
 
 
 
by email.  Service must be in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
Administration 2.516. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You may want to inform the other party of the following information: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
As a general rule, within 30 days after service of interrogatories, the other party must answer the 
 
 
questions in writing and serve you with the answers. Service of the answers must be in compliance with 
 
 
Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516.  His or her answers may be written on 
 
as many separate sheets of paper as necessary. He or she should number each page and indicate which 
 
 
 
question(s) he or she is answering, and be sure to make a copy for him/herself.  All answers to these 
 
 
questions are made under oath or affirmation as to their truthfulness. Each question must be answered 
 
 
separately and as completely as the available information permits. The original of the answers to the 
 
interrogatories is to be provided to the requesting party.  Do not file the original or a copy with the clerk 
 
 
of the circuit court except as provided in Florida Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.340(d). 
 
 
The other party may object to a question by writing the legal reason for the objection in the space 
 
 
provided. He or she may also ask the court for a protective order granting him or her permission not to 
 
 
answer certain questions and protecting him or her from annoyance, embarrassment, apprehension, or 
 
 
 
undue burden or expense. If the other party fails to either answer or object to the questions within 30 
 
 
 
days, he or she may be subject to court sanctions.

For further information, see Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 12.280, 12.285, 12.340, and 12.380. 
   
 
A copy of this form must be filed with the court and served on the other party or his or her attorney. The 
 
 
 
copy you are serving to the other party must be either mailed, e-mailed, or hand-delivered to the 
 
 
opposing party or his or her attorney on the same day indicated on the certificate of service. If it is

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, 
 
 
pleadings, and documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented 
 
 
litigants may file petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not 
 
 
required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so 
 
 
in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must 
 
 
follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be 
 
 
carefully read and followed.

After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all 
 
 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-
 
 
mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth 
 
 
in the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in 
 
 
electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the 
 
 
 
Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
 
Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of General 
 
 
 
Practice and Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
 
 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
  
 
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MAY SERVE DOCUMENTS BY E-MAIL; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT 
 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by email, the 
 
 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
  
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. 
 
 
Please CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme 
 
 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
Administration 2.516.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
