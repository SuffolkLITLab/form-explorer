you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with

SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT

YOU, THE PAYOR, ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED that, under section 61.1301, Florida Statutes, you have the 
 
responsibilities and rights set forth below with regard to the accompanying Income Deduction Order 
 
 
and/or any attachment(s): 
 
 
1.  You are required to deduct from the obligor’s income the amount specified in the income deduction 
 
order, and in the case of a delinquency the amount specified in the notice of delinquency, and to pay 
 
 
that  amount  to  the  State  of  Florida  Disbursement  Unit.  The  amount  actually  deducted  plus  all 
 
administrative charges shall not be excess of the amount allowed under s. 303(b) of the Consumer 
 
 
 
Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. §1673(b) as amended. 
 

   
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
2.  You must implement income deduction no later than the first payment date which occurs more than 
 
 
14 days after the date the income deduction order was served on you, and you shall conform the 
 
amount specified in the income deduction order or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice to 
 
 
the obligor’s pay cycle. The court should request at the time of the order that the payment cycle will 
 
 
 
reflect that of the obligor. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
3.  You must forward, within 2 days after each date the obligor is entitled to payment from you, to the 
 
 
State of Florida Disbursement Unit, the amount deducted from the obligor’s income, a statement as 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.996(b), Notice to Payor (10/21) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

to  whether  the  amount  totally  or  partially  satisfies  the  periodic  amount  specified  in  the  income 
 
deduction order, or in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice, and the specific date each deduction 
 
is made.  If the IV-D agency is enforcing the order, you shall make these notifications to the agency. 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
4. 

 

 

 

If you fail to deduct the proper amount from the obligor’s income, you are liable for the amount you 
 
 
should have deducted, plus costs, interest, and reasonable attorneys’ fees; 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

5.  You may collect up to $5 against the obligor’s income to reimburse you for administrative costs for 
 
 

the first income deduction and up to $2 for each deduction thereafter. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

6.  The notice to payor, or, in Title IV-D cases, income deduction notice, and in the case of a delinquency, 
 
 
 
the notice of delinquency, are binding on you until further notice by the obligee, IV-D agency, or the 
 
 
 
 
court or until you no longer provide income to the obligor. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.  When  you  no  longer  provide  income  to  the  obligor,  you  shall  notify  the  obligee  and  provide  the 
 
obligor’s last known address and the name and address of the obligor’s new payor, if known. If you 
 
 
violate this provision, you are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $250 for the first violation or 
 
 
$500 for any subsequent violation. If the IV-D agency is enforcing the order, you shall make these 
 
 
notifications to the agency instead of the obligee. Penalties shall be paid to the obligee or the IV-D 
 
 
 
agency, whichever is enforcing the income deduction order. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 

8.  You shall not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against an obligor because of the 
 
 
requirement for income deduction. A violation of this provision subjects you to a civil penalty not to 
 
 
exceed $250 for the first violation or $500 for any subsequent violation.  Penalties shall be paid to the 
 
 
obligee  or  the  IV-D  agency,  whichever  is  enforcing  the  income  deduction,  if any  alimony  or  child 
 
support obligation is owing.  If no alimony or child support obligation is owing, the penalty shall be 
 
 
 
paid to the obligor. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

9.  The obligor may bring a civil action in the courts of this state against a payor who refuses to employ, 
 
 
 
discharges, or otherwise disciplines an obligor because of income deduction.  The obligor is entitled 
 
to reinstatement of all wages and benefits lost, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

10.  The  requirement  for income deduction has priority over all other  legal processes  under state law 
 
pertaining to the same income and that payment, as required by the notice to payor or the income 
 
 
deduction notice, is a complete defense by the payor against any claims of the obligor or his or her 
 
creditors as to the sum paid. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.  When you receive notices to payor or income deduction notices requiring that the income of two or 
 
more obligors be deducted and sent to the same depository, the payor may combine the amounts 
 
 
 
that are to be paid to the depository in a single payment as long as the payments attributable to each 
 
 
obligor are clearly identified. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12.  If you receive more than one notice to payor or income deduction notice against the same obligor,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
