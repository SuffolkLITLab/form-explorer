INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.995(b), 
 
SUPERVISED/SAFETY-FOCUSED PARENTING PLAN 
  
(02/18) 
 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 
 
A Parenting Plan is required in all cases involving minor child(ren). This form or a similar form should be 
 
used in cases when you feel your child(ren) cannot be safely alone with the other parent or if you 
 
believe shared parental responsibility presents a detriment to the child(ren). In this case, a Parenting 
 
Plan must be developed that allows time-sharing with any minor child(ren), while providing protection 
 
for the child(ren). If safety or supervised time-sharing is not a concern, Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a) or a similar form should be used. If the case involves 
 
relocation, pursuant to Section 61.13001, Florida Statutes, then Relocation/Long Distance Parenting 
  
 
Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c) or a similar form should be used. 
 
The parents must identify a name or designation to be used throughout this Parenting Plan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

This form should be typed or printed in black ink. If an agreement has been reached, both parties must 
sign the Parenting Plan and have their signatures witnessed by a notary public or deputy clerk.  After 
completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where 
the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.  You should then refer to the instructions for 
 
your petition, answer, or answer and counterpetition concerning the procedures for setting a hearing or 
trial (final hearing). If the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be 
filed by either parent at the time of or any time prior to the final hearing.  If an agreed Parenting Plan is 
 
not filed by the parties, the court shall establish a Plan. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial

Administration.  If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
 
pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or  through  the  Florida  Courts  E-Filing  Portal,  you  must  review 
 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link

of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form

Court Approved Family  Law  Form 12.914;  Designation of Current  Mailing and E-mail  Address, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Where can I look for more information?

Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Form 12.980(h), file it with the clerk of 
the circuit court and write confidential in the space provided in the Parenting Plan. 
 
 
 
At a minimum, the Parenting Plan must describe in adequate detail: 
 
 

 
How the parties will share and be responsible for the daily tasks associated with the upbringing 
 
of the child(ren), 
 
The time-sharing schedule arrangements that specify the time that the minor child(ren) will 
 
 
spend with each parent, 
 
A designation of who will be responsible for any and all forms of health care, school-related 
matters, including the address to be used for school-boundary determination and registration, 
  
other activities, and 
The methods and technologies that the parents will use to communicate with the child(ren). 

 
 
 
The best interests of the child(ren) is the primary consideration in the Parenting Plan. In creating the 
Parenting Plan, all circumstances between the parents, including their historic relationship, domestic 
 
violence, and other factors must be taken into consideration.  Determination of the best interests of the

desirability of maintaining continuity; 
 

 

 

 
  The geographic viability of the parenting plan, with special attention paid to the needs of school-
age children and the amount of time to be spent traveling to effectuate the parenting plan.  This 
factor does not create a presumption for or against relocation of either parent with a child(ren); 
 

 

 

 

 

 
  The moral fitness of the parents; 
 
 
  The mental and physical health of the parents; 
 
 
  The home, school, and community record of the child(ren);

  The demonstrated capacity and disposition of each parent to provide a consistent routine for 
 
the child(ren), such as discipline, and daily schedules for homework, meals, and bedtime;

parent to adopt a unified front on all major issues when dealing with the child(ren); 
 
 
  Evidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child 
 
neglect, regardless of whether a prior or pending action relating to those issues has been 
brought.  If the court accepts evidence of prior or pending actions regarding domestic violence, 
 
sexual violence, child abuse, child abandonment, or child neglect, the court must specifically 
 
acknowledge, in writing that such evidence was considered when evaluating the bests interests 
of the child(ren);

prior or pending action regarding domestic violence, sexual violence, child abuse, child 
 
abandonment, or child neglect;

This standard form does not include every possible issue that may be relevant to the facts of your case.  
The Parenting Plan should be as detailed as possible to address the time-sharing schedule.  Additional 
provisions should be added to address all of the relevant factors. The parties should give special 
consideration to the age and needs of each child. 
 
 
In developing the Parenting Plan, you may wish to consult or review other materials which are available 
at your local library, law library or through national and state family organizations. 
 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out 
these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules 
of Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
