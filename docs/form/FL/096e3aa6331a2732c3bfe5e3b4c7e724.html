ANSWER TO PETITION AND COUNTERPETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF 
 
MARRIAGE WITH NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN) OR PROPERTY 
 
(02/18) 
 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 
This form should be used when you are responding to a petition for dissolution of marriage with no 
 
dependent or minor child(ren) or property and you are asking the court for something not contained in 
the petition.  The answer portion of this form is used to admit or deny the allegations contained in the 
petition, and the counterpetition portion of this form is used to ask for whatever you want the court to 
 
do for you such as restoring your former name. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
 
 
the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 
You have 20 days to answer after being served with the other partyâ€™s petition.  A copy of this form must 
be mailed, e-mailed, or hand delivered to the other party.  After you file an answer and counterpetition 
 
 
your case will then generally proceed as follows: 
 
The other party is required to answer your counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to 
 
Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 
 
UNCONTESTED.  Your dissolution is uncontested if you and your spouse agree on all issues raised in the 
 
petition and the counterpetition.  If this is the case, and you and the other party have complied with 
 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either party may contactthe clerk, family law 
 
intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  If you request the hearing, you must notify the 
other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form.

CONTESTED.  Your dissolution is contested if you and your spouse disagree on any issues raised in the 
 
 
petition or counterpetition.  If you are unable to settle the disputed issues, either party may file a Notice 
 
 
for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with 
 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers.  Some circuits may require the completion of 
 
mediation before a final hearing may be set.  You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).

beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
