INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.981(a)(4), 
 
STEPPARENT ADOPTION: AFFIDAVIT OF DILIGENT SEARCH 
 
(03/15) 
 
 
When should this form be used? 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Use this form to obtain constructive service (also called service by publication) in a proceeding for 
stepparent adoption, Joint Petition for Adoption by Stepparent, Florida Supreme Court Approved 
 
Family Law Form 12.981(b)(1), when any required consent is unavailable because the address or location 
 
 
of the person whose consent is required is not known and cannot be determined. 
 
 
This form includes a checklist of places you must look for information on the location of the person 
 
whose rights you seek to terminate. You do have to look in all of these places, and the court must believe 
 
 
that you have made a very serious effort to get information about the person’s location and that you 
have followed up on any information you received. Section 63.054, Florida Statutes, requires that in each 
 
 
adoption a search of Florida’s Putative Father Registry must be conducted. You will need an order from 
 
the judge to do this, which you can request by filing a Motion for Search of the Putative Father Registry, 
 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.981(a)(6). 
  
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should file the original 
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your petition was filed and keep a copy for your 
 
records. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be filed 
 
electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or  other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file your 
 
pleadings  or  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial 
 
Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules 
 
and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
 
beginning of these forms. For further information, see rule 12.070, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure and Rule 1.070, Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Special notes... 
 

 

 
 

 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
 
 
 
he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
