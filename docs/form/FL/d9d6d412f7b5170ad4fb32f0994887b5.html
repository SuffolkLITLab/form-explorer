INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.980(f), 
  
PETITION FOR INJUNCTION FOR 
  
PROTECTION AGAINST REPEAT VIOLENCE 
 
(10/22) 
 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 
 
If you or a member of your immediate family are a victim of repeat violence, you can use this form to ask 
 
the court for a protective order prohibiting repeat violence. Repeat violence means that two incidents of 
violence have been committed against you or a member of your immediate family by another person, one 
 
 
of  which  must  have  been  within  6  months  of  filing  this  petition.  Repeat  violence  includes  assault, 
aggravated  assault,  battery,  aggravated  battery,  sexual  assault,  sexual  battery,  stalking,  aggravated 
  
 
stalking, kidnapping, or false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death. 
 
Because you are making a request to the court, you are called the petitioner.  The person whom you are 
 
asking the court to protect you from is called the respondent.  If you are under the age of eighteen and 
have never been married or had the disabilities of nonage removed by a court, one of your parents or 
   
your legal guardian must sign this petition on your behalf. 
 
The parent or legal guardian of any minor child who is living at home may seek an injunction for protection 
 
 
  
against repeat violence on behalf of the minor child.  With respect to a minor child who is living at home, 
 
the  parent  or  legal  guardian  must  have  been  an  eye-witness  to,  or  have  direct  physical  evidence  or 
   
affidavits from eye-witnesses of, the specific facts and circumstances that form the basis of the petition. 
 
 
If the respondent is your spouse, former spouse, related to you by blood or marriage, living with you now 
 
or has lived with you in the past (if you are or were living as a family), or the other parent of your child(ren), 
whether or not you have ever been married or ever lived together, you should use Petition for Injunction 
 
for Protection Against Domestic Violence,  Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(a), 
  
 
rather than this form. 

 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  You should complete this form (giving as much detail 
 
as possible) and sign it the presence of a notary or in front of the clerk of the circuit court in the county 
 
where you live. The clerk will take your completed petition to a judge.  You should keep a copy for your 
 
records.  If have any questions or need assistance completing this form, the clerk or family law intake 
 
staff will help you. 
 
 

 
What should I do if the judge grants my petition? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the facts contained in your petition convince the judge that you or a member of your immediate family 
 
 
are a victim of repeat violence and that an immediate and present danger of repeat violence to you or 
 
that family exists, the  judge  will  sign  a Temporary Injunction for Protection  Against Repeat Violence, 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(k).  A temporary injunction is issued without 
 
 
notice to the respondent.  The clerk will give your petition, the temporary injunction, and any other papers 
 
filed  with  your  petition  to  the  sheriff  or  other  law  enforcement  officer  for  personal  service  on  the

Against Repeat Violence (10/22) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

respondent. The temporary injunction will take effect immediately after the respondent is served with a 
 
copy of it.  It lasts until a full hearing can be held or for a period of 15 days, whichever comes first.  The 
 
court may extend the temporary injunction beyond 15 days for a good reason, which may include failure 
 
 
to obtain service on the respondent. 
 
 
The  temporary  injunction  is  issued  ex  parte.  This  means  that  the  judge  has  considered  only  the 
information  presented  by  one  side--YOU.    Section  I of  the  temporary  injunction  gives  a  date that  you 
 
 
should appear in court for a hearing. You will be expected to testify about the facts in your petition.  The 
 
respondent will be given the opportunity to testify at this hearing, also.  At the hearing, the judge will 
 
decide whether to issue a Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against Repeat Violence (After 
 
Notice), Florida  Supreme Court  Approved  Family Law Form 12.980(l), which will remain in effect for a 
 
specific time period or until modified or dissolved by the court.  If you and/or the respondent do not 
 
appear, the temporary injunction may be continued in force, extended, or dismissed, and/or additional 
 
orders may be granted, including entry of a permanent injunction and the imposition of court costs. 
 
You and respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction or order issued at the final hearing. 
 
 
IF EITHER YOU OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, YOU WILL BOTH BE BOUND 
 
 
BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER. 
 
 
If the judge signs a temporary or final injunction, the clerk will provide you with the necessary copies. 
  
Make sure that you keep one certified copy of the injunction with you at all times! 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I do if the judge denies my petition? 

 

 

 

 

 

If your petition is denied on the grounds that it appears to the court that no immediate and present danger 
 
 
of repeat violence exists, the court will set a full hearing on your petition.  The respondent will be notified 
 
by personal service of your petition and the hearing.  If your petition is denied, you may: amend your 
 
petition by filing a Supplemental Affidavit in Support of Petition for Injunction for Protection, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(g); attend the hearing and present facts that support 
 
 
your petition; and/or dismiss your petition. 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should  read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline are defined in that section.  The clerk of 
 
the  circuit  court  or  family  law  intake  staff  will  help  you  complete  any  necessary  forms.   For  further 
 
information,  see  Section  784.046,  Florida  Statutes,  and  Rule  12.610,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of 
   
Procedure.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
