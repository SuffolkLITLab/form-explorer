FORM 12.981(a)(6), 
 
MOTION FOR SEARCH OF THE PUTATIVE FATHER REGISTRY (11/15) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
   

 
This  form  should  be  used  when  a  stepparent  is  adopting  his  or  her  spouse’s  child.  Section  63.054, 
 
Florida  Statutes,  requires  that  a  search  of  Florida’s  Putative  Father  Registry  be  conducted  in  every 
 
 
 
adoption  proceeding.  The  Office  of  Vital  Statistics  of  the  Department  of  Health  has  an  application 
 
available called Florida Putative Father Registry - Application for Search which should be completed and 
 
 
 
attached to this form.  The Office of Vital Statistics is allowed to charge for searching the registry.  You 
 
 
 
 
may wish to  contact  that  office  in  advance  to  find  out  what  amount  and  method  of  payment  will  be 
 
accepted. 
 
 
 
This  form  should  be  typed  or  printed  in  black  ink.  The  name  to  be  given  to  the  adoptee  after  the 
 
adoption should be used in the heading of the petition.  The stepparent is the petitioner, because he or 
 
 
she is the one who  is asking the  court for legal action.  You must  have  your signature  witnessed by a 
 
notary public or deputy clerk. 
 
 
After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county 
 
where you have filed the Joint Petition for Adoption by Stepparent,  Florida Supreme Court Approved 
 
Family  Law  Form  12.981(b)(1)  and  keep  a copy  for  your  records.  These  family  law  forms  contain  an 
 
Order Granting Motion for Search of Putative Father Registry, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
 
 
Law  Form  12.981(a)(7),  which  the  judge  may  use.  You  should  check  with  the clerk,  family  law  intake 
 
staff or judicial assistant to see if you need to provide this form order to the judge with your motion.  If 
 
 
so, you should type or print  the  heading, including the  circuit, county, case  number, division, and the 
 
child(ren)’s name, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
 
filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule 
 
of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you 
 
file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

   

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 
 
If the judge grants your motion, you will need to take the order, your completed application, and any fee 
 
to the Office of Vital Statistics.  That office will conduct the search and file the results with the clerk of 
court. You may call the clerk’s office to determine when the results have been filed in order to set a final 
 
hearing. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
