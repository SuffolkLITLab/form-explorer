AGAINST DOMESTIC, REPEAT, DATING, OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE, OR 
 
STALKING (11/15) 
 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
This  form  may  be  used  if  you  are  a  party  to  a  previously  entered  injunction  for  protection  against 
 
domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking, and you want the court to modify the terms of 
 
the injunction.  If you use this form, you are called the moving party. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
before a notary public or the clerk of the circuit court.  You should then file the original with the clerk in 
 
the  county  where  the  original  petition  was  filed  and  keep  a  copy  for  your  records.  You  must  file  a 
   
 
If  you  have  any  questions  or 
motion  for  modification  before  the  previously  entered  order  expires. 
 
need assistance completing this form, the clerk or family law intake staff will help you. 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

   

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 
For your case to proceed, you will need to set a hearing on your motion.  You must properly notify the 
 
 
other party of the motion and hearing.  You should check with the clerk of court for information on the 
 
 
local procedure for scheduling a hearing.  When you know the date and time of your hearing, you should 
 
file  Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
 
 
appropriate notice of hearing form.  You will need to serve a copy of your motion and Notice of Hearing 
 
 
on  the  other  party.  Service  of  your  motion must  be  in  in  a  manner  that  is  reasonably  calculated  to 
 
apprise the other party of your motion and the hearing.  Please note that if notice is mailed or e-mailed, 
the court in certain circumstances may not consider mailing or e-mailing to be adequate notice.  If you 
want to be sure, you should consider using certified mail, return receipt requested, or having the motion 
 
 
 
   
 
If you are not represented by an attorney in this action, you must file proof that the 
personally served. 
 
 
other party personally received notice of your motion.  This is a technical area of the law; if you have 
 
  
any questions about it, you should consult a lawyer.  For more information on personal service, see the 
 
 
instructions  for  Summons:  Personal  Service  on  an  Individual,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of  Procedure 
 
Form 12.910(a). 
 
 
You will need to appear at a hearing on your motion for modification of injunction.  After the hearing, if 
 
the judge grants your motion, he or she will prepare a new injunction for protection that contains the 
 
 
 
modifications.  After the judge  signs the new injunction, the clerk will provide you with the necessary 
  
copies.  Make sure that you keep a certified copy of the new injunction with you at all times! 
 

 
 
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline are defined in that section. The clerk of 
 
the circuit court or family law intake staff will help you complete any necessary domestic, repeat, dating,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
