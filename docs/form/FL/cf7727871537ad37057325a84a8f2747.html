      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY 
 
LAW FORM 12.982(c) 
  
PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME (MINOR CHILD(REN)) 
 
(02/18) 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
This  form  should  be  used  when  parents  want  the  court  to  change  the  name  of  their  minor 
 
child(ren).  For the purposes of this proceeding, a person under the age of 18 is a minor.  This form 
 
 
is not to be used in connection with an adoption, dissolution of marriage, or paternity action.  If 
 
 
 
you want a change of name for your child(ren) because of an adoption or paternity action that is 
 
not yet final, the change of name should be requested as part of that case. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink and must be signed before a notary public or 
 
deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court, in the county where 
 
you  live  and  keep  a  copy  for  your  records.  The  Petition  should  only  be  completed  by  one 
 
 
Petitioner for one child.  If you wish to change the name of more than one child or if there is more 
 
than one Petitioner, you should complete and file a Supplemental Form for Petition for Change of 
  
Name (Minor Child) for each child and/or a Supplemental Form for Petition for Change of Name. 
 
 
 
The supplemental form(s) is an attachment to the petition.  Be sure that the bottom of each page 
   
of each supplemental form is initialed by the petitioner(s). 

  
 

  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 
 

What should I do next? 
 
Unless you are seeking to restore a former name, each adult petitioner(s)’s fingerprints must 
 
 
 
be submitted for a state and national criminal history records check.  The fingerprints must be 
 
 
taken in a manner approved by the Department of Law Enforcement. The fingerprints must be 
 
submitted to the Department of Law Enforcement for a state and national criminal history records 
 
check.  The  Petitioner(s)  may  not  request  a  hearing  on  the  Petition  until  the  copy  of  the 
 
fingerprints  are  filed  and  the  clerk  of  court  has  received  the  results  of  the  criminal  history 
 
records check.  The clerk of court can instruct you on the process for having the fingerprints taken 
 
 
and  submitted,  including  information  on  law  enforcement  agencies  or  service  providers 
 
authorized  to  submit  fingerprints  electronically  to  the  Department  of  Law  Enforcement.  The 
 
 
process may take several weeks and the parent or guardian of the minor must pay the cost of 
 
processing the fingerprints and conducting the state and national history records check. Please 
 
 
note  that  the  state  and  national  criminal  records  check  must  indicate  whether  you  have 
  
registered as either a sexual predator or a sexual offender and you must also indicate on this 
 
petition whether you have ever been required to register as a sexual predator under section 
 
 
775.21, Florida Statutes, or as a sexual offender under section 943.0435, Florida Statutes.

sought, you may both file as petitioners.  In this situation, service is not necessary, and you need 
only to set a hearing. You should ask the clerk of court, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant 
 
about the local procedure for setting a hearing. 
 
 
 
If only one parent is a resident of the county where the change of name(s) is sought or only one 
parent asks for the child(ren)’s name(s) to be changed, the other parent must be notified and his 
 
 
or  her  consent  obtained,  if  possible. 
If  the  other  parent  consents  to  the  change  of  name,  a 
 
 
Consent for Change of Name (Minor Child(ren)), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
 
Form 12.982(d), should be filed. 
 
 
If the other parent does not consent to the change of name, you may still have a hearing on the 
 
petition if you have properly notified the other parent about your petition and the hearing.  If you 
 
know where he or she lives, you must use personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where 
 
he  or  she  lives,  you  may  use  constructive  service.  For  more  information  about  personal  and 
constructive  service,  you  should  refer  [to]  the  “General  Instructions  for  Self-Represented 
 
Litigants” found at the beginning of these forms and the instructions to Florida Family Law Rules 
 
 
 
of Procedure  Forms 12.910(a)  and 12.913(b) and  Florida Supreme Court  Approved Family Law 
 
Form 12.913(a).  However, the law regarding constructive service is very complex and you may 
 
wish to consult an attorney regarding that issue. 
 
 
 
Next,  you must  obtain a  final  hearing  date  for the court to  consider your request.  If you are 
 
 
seeking to restore a former name, a hearing on the petition MAY be held immediately after the 
 
petition  is  filed.  The  final  hearing  on  any  other  petition  for  a  name  change  may  be  held 
 
immediately after the clerk of court receives the results of your criminal history records check. 
 
You  should  ask  the  clerk  of  court,  family  law  intake  staff,  or  judicial  assistant  about  the  local 
 
procedure for setting a hearing.  You may be required to attend the hearing.  Included in these 
 
forms  is  a  Final  Judgment  of  Change  of  Name  (Minor  Child(ren)),  Florida  Supreme  Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.982(e), which may be used when a judge grants a change of name 
  
for a minor child(ren).  If you attend the hearing, you should take the final judgment with you. 
 
You should complete the top part of the form, including the circuit, county, case number, division, 
 
and the name(s) of the petitioner(s) and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete.  It should 
 
be typed or printed in black ink. 
 
 
If  the  judge  grants  your  petition,  he  or  she  will  sign  this  order.  This  officially  changes  your 
child(ren)’s name(s).  The clerk can provide you with certified copies of the signed order.  There 
 
 
will be charges for the certified copies, and the clerk can tell you the amount of the charges.

The  Florida  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all  petitions,  pleadings,  and 
 
documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may 
 
file petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to 
 
do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in 
 
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures 
 
 
of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or 
 
certified  process  server,  the  Florida  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all

mail  (e-mail)  except  in  certain  circumstances.  You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format 
 
requirements  set  forth  in  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration. 
If  you  elect  to  participate  in 
 
 
 
   
electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving  pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or 
 
 
through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 
 
2.516.  You  may  find  this  rule  at  www.flcourts.org  through  the  link  to  the  Rules  of  Judicial 
Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MAY SERVE DOCUMENTS BY E-MAIL; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-
 
mail, the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
 
 
Form 12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
