When should this form be used?  

 

 
 
This form should be used when a husband and wife are filing for a simplified dissolution of 
marriage.  You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing 
 
 
for a dissolution in Florida.  You may file a simplified dissolution of marriage in Florida if all of 
 
the following are true: 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
	  You and your spouse agree that the marriage cannot be saved. 
 
 
	  You and your spouse have no minor or dependent child(ren) together, the wife does not 
 
have any minor or dependent children born during the marriage, and the wife is not 
 
now pregnant. 
 
 

 
	  You and your spouse have worked out how the two of you will divide the things that you 
 
 
both own (your assets) and who will pay what part of the money you both owe (your 
 
liabilities), and you are both satisfied with this division. 
 
 
 
 

 
  You are not seeking support (alimony) from your spouse, and vice versa.
 
 
 
  You are willing to give up your right to trial and appeal.

necessarily together). 
 

 
  You and your spouse are both willing to go to the final hearing (at the same time). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If you do not meet the criteria above, you must file a regular petition for dissolution of 
 
 
 
marriage. 
 
This petition should be typed or printed in black ink.  Each of you must sign the petition. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

What should I do next?  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.	  After completing this form, you should file it with the clerk of the circuit court in the county 
 
 

 
where you live and keep a copy for your records. 
   
 
 
You  may  document  your  agreement  by  signing  a  Marital  Settlement  Agreement,  Florida 
 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(f)(3) and filing it with the clerk of the circuit court 
 
or you may agree that all of your assets (what you own) and liabilities (what you owe) have 
 
 
 
been disposed of by oral agreement. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.	  You must prove to the court that the husband and/or wife has (have) lived in Florida for more

  a valid Florida driver’s license, Florida identification card, or voter registration card issued 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

to one of you at least 6 months prior to filing for dissolution of marriage; or 
 
the testimony of another person who knows that either you or your spouse has resided 
 
 
 
in Florida for more than 6 months and is available to testify in court; or 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	  an affidavit. To prove residence by affidavit, use an Affidavit of Corroborating Witness, 
 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i).  This form must be signed 
 
by a person who knows that either you or your spouse has lived in Florida for more than 
6  months  before the date  that  you filed the  petition  for  dissolution  of marriage.  This 
 
 
affidavit may be signed in the presence of the clerk of the court or in the presence of a 
 
 
notary public, who must affix his or her seal at the proper place on the affidavit. 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
3.	  You  must  pay  the  appropriate  filing  fees  to  the clerk  of  the  circuit  court.  If  you  and  your 
 
 
 
spouse cannot afford to pay the filing fees, you may fill out an Application for Determination 
 
of Civil Indigent Status, and file it with your petition for dissolution of marriage.  You may 
 
obtain this form from the clerk and he or she will determine whether you are eligible to have 
 
 
filing fees waived. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
4.	  You will need to complete a Family Court Cover Sheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Form 12.928.  The clerk’s office can provide this form. 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
5.	  Depending on your jurisdiction, you may either obtain a date and time for a court appearance 
 
 
from the clerk of court, or a date and time will be provided to you by the court.  On that date, 
 
you and your spouse must appear together before a judge.  Depending on your jurisdiction, 
 
 
you  will  either  complete  a  Final  Judgment  of  Simplified  Dissolution  of  Marriage,  Florida 
 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.990(a), and bring it with you to the hearing, or the 
judge will prepare it at the hearing. At that time, if all of the papers are in order, the judge 
 
may grant a final judgment dissolving your marriage under simplified dissolution of marriage 
 
procedures by signing the final judgment. 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
6.	  If you fail to complete this procedure, the court may dismiss the case to clear its records.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
