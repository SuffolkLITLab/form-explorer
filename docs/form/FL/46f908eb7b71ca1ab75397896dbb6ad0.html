INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE 
 
 
FORMS 12.920(a), MOTION FOR REFERRAL TO GENERAL MAGISTRATE, 
 
 
12.920(b), ORDER OF REFERRAL TO GENERAL MAGISTRATE, and 
 
 
12.920(c), NOTICE OF HEARING BEFORE GENERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
 
(04/22) 
 
When should these forms be used? 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
A general magistrate is an attorney appointed by a judge to take testimony and recommend orders on 
 
 
certain matters connected with a divorce. These recommended orders are then reviewed and entered 
by the judge unless contrary to the law or the facts of the case. The primary purposes of having general 
 
 
magistrates hear family law matters are to reduce the costs of litigation and to speed up cases. Either 
 
 
party may request that their case, or portions of their case, be heard by a general magistrate by filing 
 
 
Motion for Referral to General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.920(a). You 
 
 
must also prepare an Order of Referral to General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
 
 
Form 12.920(b), to submit to the judge assigned to your case. 
 
 
 
Many times, the court, either on its own motion or under current administrative orders of the court, 
 
 
may refer your case to a general magistrate. Even in those instances, you may be required to prepare 
 
 
and submit an Order of Referral to General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
 
12.920(b), to the judge. 
 
 
 
Once a general magistrate has been appointed to your case, the general magistrate will assign a time 
 
 
and place for a hearing as soon as reasonably possible after the referral is made. The general magistrate 
 
 
will give notice of that hearing to each of the parties directly or will direct a party or attorney in the case 
 
 
to file and serve a notice of hearing on the other party. If you are asked to send the notice of hearing, 
 
 
you will need to use the form entitled Notice of Hearing Before General Magistrate, Florida Family Law 
 
 
Rules of Procedure Form 12.920(c). Regardless of who prepares the notice of hearing, the moving party 
 
 
(the one who requested referral to the general magistrate) is required to have the notice properly 
 
 
served on the other party. 
 
 
 
 
 
These forms should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should file these 
 
 
documents with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your case is filed and keep a copy for 
 
 
 
 
your records.

litigants may file petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically, however, they are not 
 
 
required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so 
 
 
in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must 
 
 
follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be 
 
carefully read and followed. 
 
 
The copy you are providing to the other party must be either mailed, e-mailed, or hand-delivered to the

After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-
mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth 
 
in the Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic 
 
 
service, which means serving or receiving pleadings by e-mail, or through the Florida Courts E-Filing 
 
 
Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find 
 
 
this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration 
 
 
provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MAY SERVE DOCUMENTS BY E-MAIL, HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
 
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail address by using the 
 
 
 
 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears.

Court Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
Administration 2.516. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

What should I do next? 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
If you are filing a Motion for Referral to General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
 
 
Form 12.920(a), you need to send or deliver your motion directly to the judge assigned to your case, 
 
 
 
 
along with an Order of Referral to General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
 
12.920(b), and an addressed, stamped envelope for each party in the case. The judge will then either 
 
 
 
 
grant or deny the motion, usually without a hearing.

 (04/22) 
 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

If you are required to submit an Order of Referral to General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
 
 
 
Procedure Form 12.920(b), to the judge assigned to your case, you will need to send or deliver the order 
 
 
directly to the judge, along with addressed, stamped envelopes for each party in the case. 
 
 
 
The party who prepares any of these forms must file this document with the clerk of the circuit court. A 
 
 
copy of the motion must be served on any other party in your case. Service must be in accordance with 
Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Where can I look for more information? 
 
 

 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. 
For further information, see Florida Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.490. 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Special notes... 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
IMPORTANT: After the judge refers your case to a general magistrate, either party (including the party 
 
 
who was required to prepare and submit the Order of Referral) may object to the referral within 10 
 
 
days of the date that the referral is made (if the Order of Referral is served by mail, the parties have 
an additional 5 days within which to object to the referral). Every litigant is entitled to have his or her 
 
 
case heard by a judge. However, before you decide to object to an Order of Referral to General 
Magistrate, you should consider the potential extra costs and time delays that may result from having a 
 
 
judge hear your case instead of a general magistrate. You may want to speak with an attorney in your 
 
 
area who can assist you in making a more informed decision regarding whether you should file an 
 
 
objection to an Order of Referral to General Magistrate. 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out 
 
 
these forms, that person must give you a copy of Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules 
 
 
 
 
of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms 
 
 
also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every 
 
 
form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
