INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW
 
 
FORM 12.982(f)
 
 
PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME (FAMILY)
 
  
(02/18)
 
 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
This form  should be  used when  the  parents  are married and the  family  wants the court  to  change  its 
 
name.  This form is not to be used in connection with a dissolution of marriage, paternity, or adoption 
 
action.  If you want a change of name because of a dissolution of marriage, paternity, or adoption action 
 
that is not yet final, the change of name should be requested as part of that case. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink and must be signed before a notary public or deputy 
 
 
clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and keep 
 
a copy for your records. The petition should only be completed for one adult. If you wish to change the 
 
 
name(s) of another adult and/or any child(ren), you should complete and file with the clerk of court the 
 
attached  Adult  and  Child  Supplemental  Form(s)  for  Petition  for  Change  of  Name  (Family)  for  each 
   
additional family member. Be sure that the bottom of each page of each supplemental form is initialed. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

What should I do next? 
 
Unless  you  are  seeking  to  restore  a  former  name,  each  adult  petitioner  must  have  fingerprints 
 
 
submitted for a state and national criminal history records check. The fingerprints must be taken in a 
 
 
manner approved by the Department of Law Enforcement and must be submitted to the Department for 
 
a state and national criminal history records check.  You may not request a hearing on the petition until 
 
  
the clerk of court has received the results of your criminal history records check.  The clerk of court can 
 
instruct you on the process for having the fingerprints taken and submitted, including information on law 
 
enforcement  agencies  or  service  providers  authorized  to  submit  finger  prints  electronically  to  the 
 
Department of Law Enforcement.  The process may take several weeks and you will have to pay for the 
 
 
cost of processing the fingerprints and conducting the state and national criminal history records check. 
 
Please  note  that  the  state  and  national  criminal  records  check  must  indicate  whether  you  have 
 
 
registered as either a sexual predator or a sexual offender and you must also indicate on this petition 
 
whether you have ever  been required to register  as  a sexual  predator  under section 775.21,  Florida 
 
 
 
Statutes, or as a sexual offender under section 943.0435, Florida Statutes. 
 
If any of the children for whom you are requesting this change of name are not the legal children of both 
adults filing this petition, you must obtain the consent of the legal parent(s).  A parent not named as a 
 
petitioner in this action may consent by submitting a Consent for Change of Name (Minor Child(ren)), 
 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.982(d). 
 
 
If the other parent does not consent to the change of name, you may still have a hearing on the petition 
 
if you have properly notified the other parent about your petition and the hearing.  If you know where he

or she lives, you must use personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may 
 
use constructive service. For more information about personal and constructive service, you should refer 
 
 
to the “General Instructions for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the beginning of these forms and 
 
the instructions to  Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Forms 12.910(a) and 12.913(b) and  Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a).  The law on constructive service is very complex 
 
and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding constructive service. 
 
 
Next, you must obtain a final hearing date for the court to consider your request. If you are seeking to 
 
restore a former name, the final hearing on the petition MAY be held immediately after the petition is 
 
filed.  The final hearing on any other petition for a name change may be held immediately after the clerk 
 
of court receives the results of your criminal history records check.  You should ask the clerk of court, 
 
 
family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about the local procedure for setting a hearing.  You may be 
 
required to attend the hearing. Included in these forms is a Final Judgment of Change of Name (Family), 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.982(g), which may be used when a judge grants a 
 
change of name for a family.  If you attend the hearing, you should take the final judgment form with you. 
  
You should complete the top part of this form, including the circuit,  county, case number, division, the 
name(s) of the petitioner(s) and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete.  It should be typed or 
 
printed in black ink. 
 
 
If the judge grants your petition, he or she will sign this order;  This officially changes your family’s name; 
 
The clerk can provide you with certified copies of the signed order.  There will be charges for the certified 
 
copies, and the clerk can tell you the amount of the charges. 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  For further information, see section 68.07, Florida Statutes. 
 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
