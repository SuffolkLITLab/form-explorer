c.  The testimony or evidence is limited to the subject of a party's compliance with this Order of

constitute  domestic  violence  under  Chapter  741,  Florida  Statutes;  child  abuse,  neglect,  or 
 
abandonment  under  Chapter  39,  Florida  Statutes;  or  abuse,  neglect,  or  exploitation  of  an 
 
elderly or disabled adult under Chapter 825, Florida Statutes. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	 

 

 

 

 

7.  Agreement  on  Nonconfidentiality.  The  parties can  agree  to  waive  confidentiality  of  a  specific 
 
communication or all communications. The waiver must be in writing, signed by the parties and 
 
their  respective  counsel.  The  waiver  shall  be  filed  with  the  court  and  a  copy  served  on  the

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
