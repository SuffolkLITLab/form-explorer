(11/20) 
 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A child support enforcement hearing officer is an attorney who has been appointed by administrative 
 
order of the court to take testimony and recommend decisions in cases involving the establishment, 
enforcement, and/or modification of child support.  If your case only involves issues pertaining to child 
 
support, you cannot object to the referral of your case to a hearing officer. 
 
 
Use this form anytime you have set a hearing before a child support enforcement hearing officer and 
 
have been instructed to send notice of the hearing to the other party.  Before you fill out this form, you 
 
should coordinate a hearing time and date with the hearing officer and the other party.  If the 
Department of Revenue is a party to the case, you may need to schedule your hearing time with the 
 
attorney for the Department of Revenue. If your case involves a Motion for Civil Contempt in Support 
Matters pursuant to Florida Family Rule of Procedure 12.615, you should use form 12.961â€”Notice of 
Hearing on Motion for Civil Contempt/Enforcement Matters (Rule 12.615). 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should file this 
document with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your case is filed and keep a copy for 
your records. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
  
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

A copy of this form must be mailed, e-mailed, or hand-delivered to the other party in your case. 
 
 

 

 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 
After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Florida Rules of 
Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving

Enforcement Hearing Officer) (11/20) 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link 
 
 
to the Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your  signature  appears. 
 
 
Please CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family  Law  Form 12.914;  Designation of Current  Mailing and E-mail  Address, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
  

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  For further information, See Rule 12.941, Florida Family Law Rules of 
Procedure. 
   
 

  

 

 

Special notes... 
 

   

 

An attorney who has been appointed by the court to serve as a child support enforcement hearing 
 
officer can also be appointed to serve as a general magistrate.  If your case involves only child support 
issues, your case may properly be referred to a general magistrate acting as a child support enforcement 
hearing officer. 
 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out 
these forms, that person must give you a copy of Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules 
 
 
of Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms 
 
also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every 
 
form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
