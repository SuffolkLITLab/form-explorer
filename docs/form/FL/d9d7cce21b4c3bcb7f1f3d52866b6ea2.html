When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 
This form should be used when you are responding to a petition to determine paternity. You may use 
 
 
this form to admit or deny the allegations contained in the petition.  However, if you wish to ask the court 
for things not included in the petition, such as, parental responsibility and time-sharing or child support, 
 
you should file an Answer to Petition and Counterpetition to Determine Paternity and for Related Relief, 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(c). 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign this form 
 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should then file the original with the clerk of the circuit court 
 
in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents  by  e-mail, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(b), Answer to Petition to Determine 
 
 
 
 
Paternity and for Related Relief (11/15) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration2.516. 
 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
If  you  deny  that  the  person  named  in  the  petition  is  the  child(ren)’s  father,  a  Motion  for  Scientific 
 
 
 
Paternity Testing, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(e), should be filed. This is 
used to ask the court to order a scientific test to determine who is the child(ren)’s father. 
 
 
You have 20 days to file an answer to the other party’s petition. A copy of this form, along with all of the 
 
 
other forms required with this answer, must be mailed, e-mailed, or hand delivered to the other party in 
 
your case. After you file your answer, the case will generally proceed in one of the following two ways: 
 
UNCONTESTED…  This  case  is  uncontested  if  you  and  the  petitioner  agree  on  all  issues  raised  in  the 
 
petition. If this is the case, and you and the other party have complied with mandatory disclosure and 
 
filed all of the required papers, either party may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant 
 
to set a final hearing. If you request the hearing, you must notify the other party of the hearing by using 
 
a  Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
 
appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
 
CONTESTED…  This  case  is  contested  if  you  and  the  other  party  disagree  on  any  issues  raised  in  the 
 
petition. If you are unable to settle the disputed issues, either party may file a  Notice for Trial Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure 
 
and filed all of the required papers.  Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final 
 
hearing  may  be  set.  You  should  contact  the  clerk,  family  law  intake  staff,  or  judicial  assistant  for 
 
instructions on how to set your case for trial (finalhearing). 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General  Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. 
  
For further information, see chapter 742, Florida Statutes. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
With this answer, you must file the following and provide a copy to the other party: 
 

 

 

 

Special notes... 
 
 

 
  Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d).

(This must be filed within 45 days of the service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time

you do not know the other party’s income, you may file this form after the other party files his 
 
 
or her financial affidavit.) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 
 
Many  circuits  require  completion  of  mediation  before  being  allowed  to  schedule  a  final  hearing.  A 
 
 
parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should check with your 
 
local clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for more information on the parenting course and 
 
mediation requirements in your area. 
 
Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If the parents are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a 
time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide these issues as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge 
will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing schedule based on the child(ren)’s best interests. 
 
Regardless  of  whether  there  is  an  agreement  between  the  parties,  the  court  reserves  jurisdiction  to 
 
modify issues relating to minor child(ren). 
 
The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. 
This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting 
 
 
issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) are being 
 
served. For more information, you may consult sections 61.401 and 61.405, Florida Statutes. 
 
 
Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your answer. If 
 
 
 
you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an 
 
attorney before going any further. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
Child Support…  The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in meeting 
 
 
the child(ren)’s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent 
 
may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. Florida has 
 
adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based 
 
on  the  combined  income  of  both  parents  and  take  into  account  the  financial  contributions  of  both 
parents. You should file a financial affidavit, and the other parent will be required to do the same. From 
your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid. 
 
Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary 
 
 
 
from  state  to  state,  your  child  support  obligation  may  be  more  or  less  than  that  of  other  people  in 
 
seemingly similar situations. 
 
 
Final Judgments… These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Paternity, Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.983(g), which the judge may use. You should check with the clerk, family 
 
 
 
law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring it with you to the hearing.  If so, you should 
type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties’ names, and 
 
 
 
 
 
leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial.

Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from a Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
 
he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
