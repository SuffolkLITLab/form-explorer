      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
FORM 12.901(b)(3)  
PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE WITH 
NO DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN) OR PROPERTY  
(02/18) 

When should this form be used? 

his form may be used when you are filing for a dissolution of marriage, and you and your spouse have 
no marital assets or marital liabilities, no minor or dependent children, neither spouse is seeking spousal 
support (alimony), and neither spouse is pregnant.  You or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at 
least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida. If you and your spouse agree on all issues and both 
can attend the hearing, you may want to file a Petition for Simplified Dissolution of Marriage, Florida 
Family  Law  Rules  of  Procedure  Form  12.901(a);  however,  you  cannot  file  a  Petition  for  a  Simplified 
Dissolution of Marriage if any of the following are true: 

  Either you or your spouse is seeking spousal support (alimony). 
  You would like to ask questions and get documents concerning your spouse’s income, expenses, 

assets, debts, or other matters before having a trial or settlement. 

  You  would  like  to  reserve  your  rights  to  have  any matters  reconsidered  or  appeal  the  judge’s 

decision. 

   

This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.  Because you are filing the petition in this 
proceeding, you may also be referred to as the petitioner and your spouse as the respondent. 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 

he Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 

What should I do next? 

or your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition.  If you know where he 
or she lives, you should use personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you 
may use constructive service.  You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in

another state or country.  However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the 
court may only grant limited relief, which cannot include spousal support (alimony).  For more 
information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage (No Child or 
Financial Support), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a)(1), and Affidavit of 
Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b).  If your spouse is in 
the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for example, 
Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
12.912(a) and Affidavit of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
12.912(b).  In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military 
service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues. 

f personal service is used, your spouse has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition.  
Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 

EFAULT.  If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have 
filed all of the required papers, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to 
set a final hearing.  You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

NCONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer 
and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you 
may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify 
your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

ONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or 

denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a 
Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers.  Some circuits may require the completion of 
mediation before a final hearing may be set.  You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If your spouse files an 
answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to 
Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 

Where can I look for more information? 

efore proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the

there.  For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
