      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE 
  
FORM 12.932 
 
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE WITH MANDATORY DISCLOSURE 
  
(11/20) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

When should this form be used? 
 
 
Mandatory  disclosure  requires  each  party  in  a  family  matter  to  provide  the  other  party  with  certain 
 
financial information and documents.  These documents must be served on the other party within 45 days 
 
of  service  of  the  initial  petition  or  supplemental  petition  for  modification  on  the  respondent.  The 
mandatory disclosure rule applies to all original and supplemental cases, except simplified dissolution of 
 
marriage cases and cases where the respondent is served by constructive service and does not answer. 
  
You  should  use  this  form  to  notify  the  court  and  the  other  party  that  you  have  complied  with  the 
 
 
mandatory disclosure rule. 
 
 
Each party must provide the other party with the documents listed in section 2 of this form if the relief 
 
being sought is permanent regardless of whether it is an initial or supplemental proceeding.  ONLY THE 
 
COMPLETED  FORM  IS  FILED  WITH  THE  COURT.  EXCEPT  FOR  THE  FINANCIAL  AFFIDAVIT  AND  CHILD 
 
SUPPORT GUIDELINES WORKSHEET, NO DOCUMENTS SHALL BE FILED IN THE COURT FILE WITHOUT A 
 
PRIOR COURT ORDER. THE DOCUMENTS LISTED ON THE FORM ARE TO BE GIVEN TO THE OTHER PARTY. 
  
 
If your individual gross annual income is under $50,000, you should complete the Family Law Financial 
 
Affidavit (Short Form), Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b).  If your individual gross 
 
annual income is $50,000 or more, you should complete the Family Law Financial Affidavit (Long Form), 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(c). 
   
 
In  addition,  there  are  separate  mandatory  disclosure  requirements  that  apply  to  temporary  financial 
 
hearings, which are listed in section 1 of this form.  The party seeking temporary financial relief must serve 
 
these documents on the other party with the notice of temporary financial hearing.  The responding party 
 
 
must  serve  the  required  documents  on  the  party  seeking  temporary  relief.  Any  documents  that  have 
 
 
already  been  served  under  the  requirements  for  temporary  or  initial  proceedings  do  not  need  to  be 
 
reserved again in the same proceeding. If a supplemental petition is filed, seeking modification, then the 
 
mandatory disclosure requirements begin again. 
 
 
You must state with specificity the documents that you are producing to the other party. References to 
 
account  numbers  and  personal  identifying  information  are  governed  by  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial 
 
Administration 2.425, which you should review prior to completing this form. 
 
 
This  form  should  be  typed  or  printed  in  black  ink.  After  completing  this  form,  you  should  file  this 
document with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your case is filed and keep a copy for 
 
your records.  A copy of this form must be served on any other party in your case.  Service must be in 
 
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.

Disclosure (11/20) 
 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
After you have provided the other party all of the financial information and documents and have filed this 
 
form certifying that you have complied with this rule, you are under a continuing duty to promptly give 
 
the  other  party  any  information  or  documents  that  change  your  financial  status  or  that  make  the 
 
information already provided inaccurate.  You should not file with the clerk any of the documents listed 
 
in  the  certificate  of  compliance  other  than  the  financial  affidavit  and  the  child  support  guidelines 
 
worksheet.  Refer to the instructions regarding the petition in your case to determine how you should 
 
proceed after filing this form. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at 
 
the beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined 
 
there.  For further information, see Florida Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.285. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents 
 
be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida 
 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the  judicial circuit in 
 
 
which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
  
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required 
 
or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in 
 
certain  circumstances.  You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format  requirements  set  forth  in  the 
 
 
Florida Rules of Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means 
serving or receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, 
 
you  must  review  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial  Administration  2.516.  You  may  find  this  rule  at 
www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family 
 
Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by email, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. 
 
Please  CAREFULLY  read  the  rules  and  instructions  for:  Certificate  of  Service  (General),  Florida 
 
Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.914;  Designation  of  Current  Mailing  and  E-mail

Special notes. . . 
 

 

 

You may provide copies of required documents; however, the originals must be produced for inspection 
 
if the other party requests to see them. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Although the financial affidavits are based on individual gross income, either party may ask the other 
 
party to complete the Family Law Financial Affidavit (Long Form), Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
 
Form  12.902(c),  by  serving  the  appropriate 
interrogatory  form.  (See  Standard  Family  Law 
 
 
 
Interrogatories,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of  Procedure  Form  12.930(b)  (original  proceedings)  or  (c) 
 
(modification proceedings)). 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Any portion of the mandatory disclosure rule may be modified by order of the judge or agreement of 
 
 
the  parties.  Therefore,  you  and  the  other  party  may  agree  that  you  will  not  require  each  other  to 
 
produce the documents required under the mandatory disclosure rule.  This exception does not apply 
 
to the Financial Affidavit, Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), which is required in all 
 
cases and cannot be waived. 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.  If a nonlawyer helps you fill out 
 
these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules 
 
of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms 
 
also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every 
 
form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
