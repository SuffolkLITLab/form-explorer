When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
If  you  are  the  petitioner  on  a  previously  entered  injunction  for  protection  against  domestic  violence, 
 
repeat violence, dating violence, sexual violence, or stalking, and that injunction will soon expire, you may 
 
 
use  this  form  to  request  that  the  court  extend  the  injunction.  You  must  file  a  motion  for  extension 
 
BEFORE the previously entered order expires. 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign it before a 
 
notary public or the clerk of the circuit court.  You should then file the original with the clerk in the county 
 
 
where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.  If you have any questions or need assistance 
 
completing this form, the clerk or family law intake staff will help you.

For your case to  proceed, you will need to set  a  hearing on your motion.  You must  properly  notify the 
 
 
other party of the motion and hearing.  You should check with the clerk of court for information on the 
 
 
local procedure for scheduling a hearing.  When you know the date and time of your hearing, you should 
 
file  Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
 
 
appropriate notice of hearing form.  You will need to serve a copy of your motion and Notice of Hearing on 
 
 
the other party by U.S. mail, e-mail, or hand delivery.  Service of your motion must be in in a manner that 
 
is  reasonably  calculated  to  apprise  the  other  party  of  your  motion  and  the  hearing.  Please  note  that  if 
 
notice is mailed or e-mailed, the court in certain circumstances may not consider mailing or e-mailing to be 
 
 
If  you  want  to  be  sure,  you  should  consider  using  certified  mail,  return  receipt 
adequate  notice.

questions  about  it,  you  should  consult  a  lawyer.  For  more  information  on  personal  service,  see  the 
 
instructions for Summons:  Personal Service on an Individual, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
12.910(a). 
 
   
You will need to appear at the hearing on your motion.  After the hearing, if the judge grants your motion, 
 
 
he or she will prepare an Order Extending Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence, Repeat 
 
Violence,  Dating  Violence, or  Sexual  Violence, or  Stalking,  Florida Supreme  Court Approved Family  Law 
Form  12.980(m).  After  the  judge  signs  the  order,  the  clerk  will  provide  you  with  the  necessary  copies. 
 
Make sure that you keep a certified copy of the previously entered injunction AND a certified copy of the 
  
order extending that injunction with you at all times.

The  Florida  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all  petitions,  pleadings,  and  documents  be 
 
 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances.  Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings  or  documents  electronically;  however,  they  are  not  required  to  do  so.  If  you  choose  to  file 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
  
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
