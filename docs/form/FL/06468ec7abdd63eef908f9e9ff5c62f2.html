arenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If you and your spouse are unable to agree on parenting arrangements 
and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge

hild  Support.  Both  parents  are  required  to  provide  financial  support  for  their  minor  or  dependent 
child(ren); however, the court may order one parent  to pay  child support  to the other parent.  Florida 
has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines are based 
on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both parents 
and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each parent.  You must file a Family Law Financial 
Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required 
to do the same.  From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support 
that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
Form 12.902(e).  Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over 
time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other 
people in seemingly similar situations. 

limony.  Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that one spouse has an actual need for 
it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay. If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in 
your counterpetition.  If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you 
may  not request  it  later).    You may  request  permanent  alimony,  bridge-the-gap  alimony,  durational 
alimony,  and/or rehabilitative alimony. If alimony is awarded, the judge may order periodic payments, 
payments in lump sum, or both. 

arital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities. Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets 
and marital liabilities.  Equitable does not necessarily mean equal.  Many factors, including child support, 
time-sharing and alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution 
of assets and liabilities.  Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which 
the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties.  
If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it 
when distributing marital assets and liabilities. 

arenting Plan. In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved 
or  established  by  the  court.  If  you  and  your  spouse  have  reached  an  agreement,  you  should  file  a 
Parenting  Plan,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.995(a),  12.995(b),  or  12.995(c), 
which addresses the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a 
proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. If you and your spouse cannot agree, a Parenting Plan will be 
established by the court. 

emporary  Relief.  If  you  need  temporary  relief  regarding  temporary  use  of  assets,  temporary 
responsibility  for  liabilities,  parental  responsibility  and  time-sharing  with  child(ren),  temporary  child 
support, or temporary alimony, you may file a  Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a).  For more 
information, see the instructions for that form. 

arital Settlement Agreement. If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of 
the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent 
or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1).  Both of you must

will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing. 

inal Judgment Form. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(1), which 
the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, 
the  judge  may  use  a  Final  Judgment  of  Dissolution of  Marriage with  Dependent  or  Minor Child(ren) 
(Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(1).  You should contact the 
clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to 
the  hearing.    If  so,  you  should  type  or  print  the  heading,  including  the  circuit,  county,  case  number, 
division, and the parties’ names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or 
trial. 

onlawyer.  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you 
fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law 
Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these 
forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of 
every form he or she helps you complete.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
