This form should be used by an attorney who is terminating a limited appearance for a client under Florida 
 
 
Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.040. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, the attorney should sign this 
 
 
document and then file this document with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the action 
 
 
 
is pending. The attorney should keep a copy for his or her records. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

   

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
A copy of this form must be filed with the court and served on the other party or his or her attorney.  The 
 
 
copy you are serving to the other party must be either mailed, e-mailed, or hand-delivered to the opposing

be postmarked on the date indicated in the certificate of service.  Service must be in accordance with 
 
Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, 
 
 
pleadings, and documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented 
 
 
litigants may file petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not 
 
 
required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so 
 
 
in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must 
 
 
follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be 
 
 
carefully read and followed. 
  
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all 
 
 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-
 
 
mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth 
 
 
in the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in 
 
 
electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the 
 
 
 
Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
 
Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of General 
 
 
 
Practice and Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
 
 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index.

REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by email, the 
 
 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made.

Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
