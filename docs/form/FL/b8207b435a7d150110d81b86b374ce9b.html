INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED 
 
FAMILY LAW FORM 12.980(a) 
  
PETITION FOR INJUNCTION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST 
 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (10/22) 
 
When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

If you are a victim of any act of domestic violence or have reasonable cause to believe that you are in 
 
imminent danger of becoming a victim of domestic violence, you can use this form to ask the court for a 
 
 
protective order prohibiting domestic violence.  Because you are making a request to the court, you are 
 
called  the  petitioner.    The  person  whom  you  are  asking  the  court  to  protect  you  from  is  called  the 
 
respondent.  Domestic violence includes: assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual 
assault,  sexual  battery,  stalking,  aggravated  stalking,  kidnapping,  false  imprisonment,  or  any  other 
criminal  offense  resulting  in  physical  injury  or  death  to  petitioner  by  any  of  petitioner’s  family  or 
 
household members.  In determining whether you have reasonable cause to believe you are in imminent 
 
danger of becoming a victim of domestic violence, the court must consider all relevant factors alleged in 
 
 
the petition, including, but not limited to the following: 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  The history between the petitioner and the respondent, including threats, harassment, stalking, 
 

 

2.  Whether the respondent has attempted to harm the petitioner or family members or individuals 
 

 

 

and physical abuse. 
 

closely associated with the petitioner. 
 

 

 

3.  Whether  the  respondent  has  threatened  to  conceal,  kidnap,  or  harm  the  petitioner’s  child  or 
 

 

 

 

 
4.  Whether the respondent has intentionally injured or killed a family pet. 
 
5.  Whether the respondent has used, or has threatened to use, against the petitioner any weapons 

 

 
 

 
6.  Whether the respondent has physically restrained the petitioner from leaving the home or calling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
children. 
 

 
such as guns or knives. 

 
 
law enforcement. 
 

 

 
 
 

 
7.  Whether the respondent has a criminal history involving violence or the threat of violence. 
 
8.  The existence of a verifiable order of protection issued previously or from another jurisdiction. 
 
9.  Whether  the  respondent  has  destroyed  personal  property,  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
 
telephones  or  other  communications  equipment,  clothing,  or  other  items  belonging  to  the 
 
petitioner. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
10.  Whether the respondent engaged in any other behavior or conduct that leads the petitioner to 
 
have reasonable cause to believe that he or she is in imminent danger of becoming a victim of 
 
domestic violence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The domestic violence laws only apply to your situation if the respondent is your spouse, former spouse, 
 
related to you by blood or marriage, living with you now or has lived with you in the past (if you are or 
 
were living as a family), or the other parent of your children whether or not you have ever been married 
 
or  ever  lived  together.  With  the  exception  of  persons  who  have  a  child  in  common,  the  family  or 
  
household members must be currently residing together or have in the past resided together in the same

single dwelling unit.  If the respondent is not one of the above, you should look at Petition for Injunction 
for Protection Against Repeat Violence, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(f), to 
 
determine if your situation will qualify for an injunction for protection against repeat violence, or Petition 
 
for Injunction for Protection Against Dating Violence, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.980(n),  to  determine  if  your  situation  will  qualify  for  an  injunction  for  protection  against  dating 
 
violence,  or  Petition  for  Injunction  for  Protection  Against  Sexual  Violence,  Florida  Supreme  Court 
 
Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.980(q),  to  determine  if  your  situation  will  qualify  for  an  injunction  for 
 
 
protection against sexual violence. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you are under the age of eighteen and you have never been married or had the disabilities of nonage 
 
removed by a court, then one of your parents, custodians, or your legal guardian must sign this petition 
 
with you. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  You should complete this form (giving as much detail 
 
as possible) and sign it in front of a notary public or the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you 
 
live.  The clerk will take your completed petition to a judge.  You should keep a copy for your records.  If 
 
 
you have any questions or need assistance completing this form, the clerk or family law intake staff will 
 
help you. 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do if the judge grants my petition? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

   

 
 

If the facts contained in your petition convince the judge that you are a victim of domestic violence or that 
 
an  imminent  danger  of  domestic  violence  exists,  the  judge  will  sign  either  an  immediate  Temporary 
 
Injunction  for  Protection  Against  Domestic  Violence  with  Minor  Child(ren),  Florida  Supreme  Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.980(c)(1) or an immediate Temporary Injunction for Protection Against 
Domestic  Violence  without  Minor  Child(ren),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form 
12.980(c)(2).  A temporary injunction is issued without notice to the respondent.  The clerk will give your 
 
petition, the temporary injunction, and any other papers filed with your petition to the sheriff or other 
 
law enforcement officer for personal service on the respondent.  The temporary injunction will take effect 
 
immediately after the respondent is served with a copy of it.  It lasts until a full hearing can be held or for 
a period of 15 days, whichever comes first.  The court may extend the temporary injunction beyond 15 
 
days for a good reason, which may include failure to obtain service on the respondent. 
 
 
 
The  temporary  injunction  is  issued  ex  parte.  This  means  that  the  judge  has  considered  only  the 
information presented by one side—YOU.  The temporary injunction gives a date that you must appear in 
 
court for a hearing.  At that hearing, you will be expected to testify about the facts in your petition.  The 
 
respondent will be given the opportunity to testify at this hearing, also.  At the hearing, the judge will 
 
decide whether to issue either a Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence 
 
 
with Minor Child(ren)(After Notice), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(d)(1), or 
 
a Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence without Minor Child(ren)(After 
 
 
Notice), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(d)(2).  Either of these final judgments 
 
 
will remain in effect for a specific time period or until modified or dissolved by the court.  If either you or 
 
the respondent do not appear at the final hearing, the temporary injunction may be continued in force,

extended,  or  dismissed,  and/or  additional  orders  may  be  granted,  including  entry  of  a  permanent 
 
 
injunction and the imposition of court costs.  You and respondent will be bound by the terms of any 
 
 
 
injunction issued at the final hearing. 
 
IF EITHER YOU OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, YOU WILL BOTH BE BOUND 
 
BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION ISSUED IN THIS MATTER. 
 
 
If the judge signs a temporary or final injunction, the clerk will provide you with the necessary copies. 
 
Make sure that you keep one certified copy of the injunction with you at all times! 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I do if the judge denies my petition? 
 

 

 

 

 

If your petition is denied solely on the grounds that it appears to the court that no imminent danger of 
 
domestic violence exists, the court will set a full hearing, at the earliest possible time, on your petition, 
 
unless you request that no hearing be set.  The respondent will be notified by personal service of your 
 
petition and the hearing.  If your petition is denied, you may: amend your petition by filing a Supplemental 
 
Affidavit  in  Support  of  Petition  for  Injunction  for  Protection  Against  Domestic  Violence,  Repeat  or 
 
 
Dating Violence, Florida Family Law Form 12.980 (g); attend the hearing and present facts that support 
 
your petition; and/or dismiss your petition. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information?

beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline are defined in that section.  The clerk of 
 
the circuit court or family law intake staff will help you complete any necessary domestic violence forms

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
