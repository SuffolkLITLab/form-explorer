INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.980(q) 
 
PETITION FOR INJUNCTION FOR 
  
PROTECTION AGAINST SEXUAL VIOLENCE (10/22) 
 
 
When should this form be used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

sexual battery, as defined in Chapter 794, Florida Statutes; 
 

If you are a victim of sexual violence or the parent or legal guardian of a minor child who is living at home 
 
 
and is a victim of sexual violence, you can use this form to ask the court for a protective order prohibiting 
 
sexual violence.  Sexual violence means any one incident of: 
 
• 
 
•  a  lewd  or  lascivious  act,  as  defined  in  Chapter  800,  Florida  Statutes,  committed  upon  or  in  the 
 
 

 
presence of a person younger than 16 years of age; 
 
luring or enticing a child, as described in Chapter 787, Florida Statutes; 
 
sexual performance by a child, as described in Chapter 827, Florida Statutes; or 
 

• 
 
• 
 
•  any other forcible felony wherein a sexual act is committed or attempted 
 
 
 
In order to get an injunction you must have reported the sexual violence to a law enforcement agency 
 
and be cooperating in the criminal proceeding if there is one. It does not matter whether criminal charges 
 
 
based on the sexual violence have been filed, reduced, or dismissed by the state attorney’s office. You 
 
may also seek an injunction for protection against sexual violence if the respondent was sent to prison for 
 
committing one of the sexual violence crimes listed above against you or your minor child living at home 
 
and respondent is out of prison or is getting out of prison within 90 days of your petition. Attach the notice 
 
of inmate release to your petition. 
 
 
Because you are making a request to the court, you are called the petitioner. The person whom you are 
asking  the  court  to  protect  you  from  is  called  the  respondent.  If  you  are  seeking  an  injunction  for 
protection against sexual violence on behalf of a minor child who is living at home, the parent or legal 
 
guardian  must  have  been  an  eyewitness  to,  or  have  direct  physical  evidence  or  affidavits  from 
 
 
eyewitnesses of, the specific facts and circumstances that form the basis of the petition. If you are under 
 
the age of eighteen and have never been married or had the disabilities of nonage removed by a court, 
 
 
one of your parents or your legal guardian must sign this petition on your behalf. 
   
 
 
If the respondent is your spouse, former spouse, related to you by blood or marriage, living with you now 
 
or has lived with  you  in  the  past  (if  you are or were living as a family), or is  the other parent of your 
child(ren) whether or not you have ever been married or ever lived together, you should use Petition for 
 
 
Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
  
12.980(a), rather than this form. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. You should complete this form (giving as much detail as 
 
possible) and sign it the presence of a notary or in front of the clerk of the circuit court in the county 
 
where you live. The clerk will take your completed petition to a judge. You should keep a copy for your 
 
 
records. If you have any questions or need assistance completing this form, the clerk or family law intake 
 
staff will help you. 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(q), Petition for Injunction for Protection 
 
Against Sexual Violence (10/22) 
 

 

 

What should I do if the judge grants my petition? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
If  the  facts  contained  in  your  petition  convince  the  judge  that  an  immediate  and  present  danger  of 
 
violence exists, the judge will sign a Temporary Injunction for Protection Against Sexual Violence, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(r).  A temporary injunction is issued without notice to 
 
the respondent. The clerk will give your petition, the temporary injunction, and any other papers filed 
 
with your petition to the sheriff or other law enforcement officer for personal service on the respondent. 
 
The temporary injunction will take effect immediately after the respondent is served with a copy of it. It 
 
lasts  until  a  full  hearing  can  be  held  or  for  a  period  of  15  days,  whichever  comes  first,  unless  the 
 
respondent  is  incarcerated,  and  in  such  instance  the  temporary  injunction  is  effective  for  15  days 
 
following the date the respondent is released from incarceration. The court may extend the temporary 
 
injunction  beyond  15  days  for  a  good  reason,  which  may  include  failure  to  obtain  service  on  the 
 
respondent. 
 
 
 
The  temporary  injunction  is  issued  ex  parte.  This  means  that  the  judge  has  considered  only  the 
 
information  presented  by  one  side--YOU.  Section  I  of  the  temporary  injunction  gives  a  date  that  you 
should appear in court for a hearing. You will be expected to testify about the facts in your petition.  The 
 
respondent will be given the opportunity to testify at this hearing, also.  At the hearing, the judge will 
decide whether to issue a Final Judgment of Injunction  for  Protection Against Sexual Violence  (After 
 
 
Notice), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(s), which will remain in effect for a 
specific time period or until modified or dissolved by the court.  If you and/or the respondent do not 
 
 
appear, the temporary injunction may be continued in force, extended, or dismissed, and/or additional 
 
orders may be granted, including entry of a permanent injunction and the imposition of court costs. 
 
You and respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction or order issued at the final hearing. 
 
 
 
IF EITHER YOU OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, YOU WILL BOTH BE BOUND 
 
BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER. 
 
  
If the judge signs a temporary or final injunction, the clerk will provide you with the necessary copies. 
Make sure that you keep one certified copy of the injunction with you at all times! 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I do if the judge denies my petition? 

 

 

 

 
If your petition is denied on the grounds that it appears to the court that no immediate and present danger 
 
of sexual violence exists, the court will set a full hearing on your petition.  The respondent will be notified 
 
by personal service of your petition and the hearing.  If your petition is denied, you may: amend your 
 
petition by filing a Supplemental Affidavit in Support of Petition for Injunction for Protection, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980 (g); attend the hearing and present facts that support 
 
your petition; and/or dismiss your petition. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
Before proceeding, you  should  read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline are defined in that section.  The clerk of 
 
the circuit court or family law intake staff will provide you with necessary forms. For further information,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
