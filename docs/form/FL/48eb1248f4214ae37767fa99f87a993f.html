INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.980(n) 
 
PETITION FOR INJUNCTION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST DATING 
 
VIOLENCE (10/22) 
 
 
When should this form be used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

   

   

   

 
 

 
If you are a victim of dating violence, and have reasonable cause to believe you are in imminent danger 
 
of becoming the victim of another act of dating violence, or if you have reasonable cause to believe that 
 
you are in imminent danger of becoming a victim of dating violence, you can use this form to ask the 
 
 
court  for  a  protective  order  prohibiting  dating  violence.  Dating  violence  means  violence  between 
 
 
individuals  who  have  or  have  had  a  continuing  and  significant  relationship  of  a  romantic  or  intimate 
nature.  The  dating  relationship  must  have  existed  within  the  past  six  months,  the  nature  of  the 
 
 
relationship  must  have  been  characterized  by  the  expectation  of  affection  or  sexual  involvement 
 
between the parties, and the frequency and type of interaction must have included that the persons 
 
have been involved over time and on a continuous basis during the course of the relationship.  Dating 
 
violence does not include violence in a casual acquaintanceship or violence between individuals who 
only have engaged in ordinary fraternization in a business or social context.  Dating violence includes 
assault,  aggravated  assault,  battery,  aggravated  battery,  sexual  assault,  sexual  battery,  stalking, 
 
aggravated stalking, kidnapping, or false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury 
 
or death.  Because you are making a request to the court, you are called the petitioner.  The person whom 
 
you are asking the court to protect you from is called the respondent. If you are under the age of eighteen 
 
 
and have never been married or had the disabilities of nonage removed by a court, one of your parents 
   
or your legal guardian must sign this petition on your behalf. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If you are filing on behalf of a child or children 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The parent or legal guardian of any minor child who is living at home may seek an injunction for protection 
 
 
against dating violence on behalf of the minor child. With respect to a minor child who is living at home, 
 
 
if the party against whom the protective injunction is sought is also a parent, stepparent, or legal guardian, 
 
 
you, as the parent or legal guardian filing the petition, must have been an eye-witness to, or have direct 
 
physical evidence or affidavits from eye-witnesses of, the specific facts and circumstances that form the 
 
basis of the petition. If the party against whom the protective injunction is sought is a person OTHER THAN 
 
a parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of the minor child, you, as the parent or legal guardian filing the 
 
petition, must state why you have reasonable cause to believe that the minor child is a victim of dating 
 
 
violence. 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
If the respondent is your spouse, former spouse, related to you by blood or marriage, living with you now 
 
or has lived with you in the past (if you are or were living as a family), or the other parent of your child(ren), 
whether or not you have ever been married or ever lived together, you should use Petition for Injunction 
 
for Protection Against Domestic Violence, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(a), 
  
rather than this form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(n), Petition for Injunction for Protection 
Against Dating Violence (10/22) 
 

Additional Information 

    

 

 

 

 
 

 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  You should complete this form (giving as much detail 
 
as possible) and sign it the presence of a notary or in front of the clerk of the circuit court in the county 
 
where you live. The clerk will take your completed petition to a judge.  You should keep a copy for your 
  
records.  If you have any questions or need assistance completing this form, the clerk or family law intake 
 
 
staff will help you. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do if the judge grants my petition? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

If the facts contained in your petition convince the judge that an immediate and present danger of dating 
 
 
violence exists, the judge will sign a Temporary Injunction for Protection Against Dating Violence, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(o).  A temporary injunction is issued without notice to 
 
the respondent. The clerk will give your petition, the temporary injunction, and any other papers filed 
 
with your petition to the sheriff or other law enforcement officer for personal service on the respondent. 
 
The temporary injunction will take effect immediately after the respondent is served with a copy of it. It 
 
lasts until a full hearing can be held or for a period of 15 days, whichever comes first.  The court may 
 
 
extend the temporary injunction beyond 15 days for a good reason, which may include failure to obtain 
 
 
service on the respondent. 
 
 
 
The  temporary  injunction  is  issued  ex  parte.  This  means  that  the  judge  has  considered  only  the 
 
 
information  presented  by  one  side--YOU.    Section  I of  the  temporary  injunction  gives  a  date that  you 
 
should appear in court for a hearing. You will be expected to testify about the facts in your petition.  The 
 
respondent will be given the opportunity to testify at this hearing, also.  At the hearing, the judge will 
decide whether to issue a Final Judgment of Injunction  for  Protection Against Dating Violence (After 
 
Notice), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(p), which will remain in effect for a 
specific time period or until modified or dissolved by the court.  If you and/or the respondent do not 
 
 
appear, the temporary injunction may be continued in force, extended, or dismissed, and/or additional 
 
orders may be granted, including entry of a permanent injunction and the imposition of court costs. 
 
You and respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction or order issued at the final hearing. 
 
 
 
IF EITHER YOU OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, YOU WILL BOTH BE BOUND 
 
BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER. 
 
  
If the judge signs a temporary or final injunction, the clerk will provide you with the necessary copies. 
Make sure that you keep one certified copy of the injunction with you at all times! 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I do if the judge denies my petition? 

 

 

 

 

 

If your petition is denied on the grounds that it appears to the court that no immediate and present danger 
 
 
of dating violence exists, the court will set a full hearing on your petition.  The respondent will be notified 
 
by personal service of your petition and the hearing.  If your petition is denied, you may: amend your 
 
petition by filing a Supplemental Affidavit in Support of Petition for Injunction for Protection, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(g); attend the hearing and present facts that support 
 
 
your petition; and/or dismiss your petition.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
