FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE 
  
 
FORM 12.985(a) 
  
EXPLANATION OF COLLABORATIVE DISSOLUTION PROCESS 
  
ATTORNEY–CLIENT (10/20) 
 
 
We,  {Name  of  Attorney(s)  and  Prospective  Client}  _________________________________________, 
 
 
_________________________________ had a consultation on {Date} _______________________ during 
 
which we discussed your family matter. I/We informed you of the following: 
  
 

   
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A.  The choices that you have for handling your family matter, including reconciliation, representing 
 
yourself  (pro  se),  going  to  mediation  with  or  without  an  attorney  representing  you  before 
 
anything has been filed in court, filing papers in court with or without an attorney representing 
 
 
you to ask a judge to resolve your family matter, going to mediation after papers have been filed 
 
in court with or without you being represented by an attorney, and using the Collaborative Law 
 
 
Process; 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B.  The benefits and risks of each of the process choices to handle your family matter; 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C.  The nature and scope of your matter to be handled if you choose to use the Collaborative Law 

 

 

 

 
Process and how that process generally works; 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

D.  That the Collaborative Law Process cannot be used by you unless your spouse chooses to use 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

that process as well; 
  

E.  The material benefits and risks of handling your matter using the Collaborative Process; 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 
F. 

 

If you choose to use the Collaborative Law Process, your participation is voluntary and either 
you or your spouse can choose to leave the process at any time; 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

G.  That if you  and your  spouse  choose  to  use  the  Collaborative  Law  Process,  the  process  will  be 
terminated if you or your spouse initiate proceedings or seek court intervention except in limited 
circumstances; and 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H.  That if you and your spouse choose to use the Collaborative Law Process, I/we and your spouse’s 
 
Collaborative attorney will be disqualified from representing you and your spouse in any future 
 
 
litigation in court against each other over the subject matter of the Collaborative Law Process. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the Collaborative Law Process, both you and your spouse must retain an attorney. Our fees and costs 
 
 
will be billed to you pursuant to the Retainer Agreement that you have entered into with us and there 
 
may be an Addendum to the Retainer Agreement once you and your spouse officially choose to use the 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Introduction and Explanatory Remarks for Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Forms 12.985(a–g) Collaborative 
 
 
Dissolution Process Forms (10/20) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Collaborative Law Process by signing a Participation Agreement. The other attorney will bill your spouse 
 
 
according to their retainer agreement. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I/We usually use a neutral facilitator in the Collaborative Law Process, who most likely will have a mental 
 
health background. That person will have his or her own retainer agreement with you and your spouse 
 
 
and the  facilitator will  be  paid by  you and/or your spouse.  You can  expect  the  facilitator to require a 
 
retainer of between $ _________ and $ _________ and to bill in the range of $ _______ - $ _______ per 
 
 
hour for his or her services. 
  
 
If there  are  financial  issues in your  matter,  you  and  your spouse  may  retain  the  services  of  a  neutral 
 
 
financial professional, such as a forensic accountant or a financial planner. You and your spouse will also 
 
 
enter into a retainer agreement with the neutral financial professional and be responsible for payment of 
 
that person’s fees. You can expect to pay  that professional a retainer in the range of $ ___________  -
          
$ _____________. The financial professional will bill on an hourly basis for his or her services and those 
 
 
of his or her staff. The hourly rates will vary depending upon who works on your matter. The hourly rate 
 
 
typically varies between $ ______ - $ ______ per hour. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is impossible to estimate the total cost of your matter because there are so many variables that will 
 
affect the time and cost needed to conclude the process. At this time, I/we do not know what the issues 
in dispute will be with your spouse. The simpler and fewer disputed issues that you have with your spouse, 
 
the lower the total cost of the process will be. A significant factor in the total cost for the Collaborative 
 
Law Process will be how much you and your spouse  cooperate with each other and the professionals. 
 
Cooperation should reduce the cost for each of the professionals and a lack of cooperation will cause the 
professionals to spend more time, which will cost you and your spouse more money. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

You  will  receive  monthly  invoices  from  our  office  and  you  should  receive  monthly  invoices  from  the 
facilitator and the financial professional. Therefore, you should know each month how much this process 
 
 
is costing. The cost of a process to resolve family matters is an important factor to consider when you 
 
negotiate with your spouse. Our experience has been that the Collaborative Law Process should cost less 
 
money  and  take  less  time  than  traditional  litigation,  but  there  will  be  costs  involved  no  matter  what 
 
process you use to resolve your differences with your spouse. I/We will talk to you regularly about the 
financial and emotional costs of decisions that you are going to make, and I/we will consult with you about 
 
how  the  disputes  with  your  spouse  would  possibly  be  resolved  if  you  were  using  another  dispute 
 
resolution method. Please feel free to discuss with us any questions that you have about the Collaborative 
Law Process and the costs involved. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I/We look forward to helping you to resolve your differences with your spouse. Our goal will be to 
 
minimize the financial, emotional, and time costs to your family. Please feel free to contact us if you 
 
ever have any questions about anything related to your matter and how we are representing you.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
