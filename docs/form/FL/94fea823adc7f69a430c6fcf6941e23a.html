When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 
This form should be used when you are responding to a supplemental petition for modification of 
 
Parenting Plan, time-sharing schedule, child support, or alimony.  This form is used to admit or deny 
 
all of the allegations in the supplemental petition if you do not plan to file a counterpetition.  There 
 
 
is no form for a counterpetition to a supplemental petition in these Family Law Forms.  If you want to 
 
file a counterpetition to a supplemental petition you will need to either seek legal assistance or create 
 
a  form  yourself.  You  may  construct  an  answer  and  counterpetition  using  the  pertinent  sections 
 
 
contained  in  the  Answer  to  Petition  and  Counterpetition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  with 
 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(c)(1), or 
 
 
Answer  to  Petition  and  Counterpetition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  with  Property  but  No 
 
 
 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(c)(2). 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the 
 
 
form before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit 
 
 
court in the county where the case was filed and keep a copy for your records.  This must be done 
 
 
within 20 days of receiving the supplemental petition. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents 
 
be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida 
 
Rule of  Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the  judicial circuit in 
 
 
which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
A copy of this form, along with all of the other forms required with this answer, must be mailed, e-
mailed,  or  hand  delivered  to  the  other  party  in  your  case.  Regardless  of  whether  you  file  a 
 
 
counterpetition, you have 20 days to answer after being served with the other party’s supplemental 
 
 
petition.  After you file your answer, the case will generally proceed in one of the following two ways: 
 
 
UNCONTESTED. If you file an answer that agrees with everything in the other party’s supplemental 
 
petition and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either

party may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  If you 
 
request  the  hearing,  you must  notify  the  other  party  of  the  hearing  by  using  a  Notice  of  Hearing 
 
(General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of 
 
 
hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED. 
If  you  file  an  answer  which  disagrees  with  or  denies  anything  in  the  supplemental 
   
 
 
petition, and  you are unable to  settle the disputed issues, either party may  file  a Notice for Trial, 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory 
 
 
disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation 
 
 
before a final hearing may be set. If you request the hearing, you should contact the clerk, family law 
 
intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at 
 
the beginning of these forms.  The words that are in “bold underline” in these instructions are defined 
 
 
  
there. See chapter 61, Florida Statutes, for more information.

After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required 
 
or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in 
 
certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules 
 
of Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or 
 
receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must 
 
review  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial  Administration  2.516.  You  may  find  this  rule  at  www.flcourts.org 
 
through  the  link  to  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  provided  under  either  Family  Law  Forms: 
 
 
Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation  of  Current  Mailing  and  E-mail  Address,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law 
 
 
Form  12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your  signature 
 
appears.  Please  CAREFULLY  read  the  rules  and  instructions  for:  Certificate  of  Service  (General), 
 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail 
 
Address,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.915;  and  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial 
 
Administration 2.516.

Parenting  and  Time-Sharing.  If  you  and  the  other  party  are  unable  to  agree  on  parenting 
 
arrangements  and  a  time-sharing  schedule,  a  judge  will  decide  for  you  as  part  of  establishing  a 
 
Parenting Plan.  The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing schedule based 
 
on the child(ren)’s best interests.  Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves 
 
jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren). 
 
 
The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. 
  
This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting 
 
issues.  The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) 
being  served.  For  more  information,  you  may  consult  section  61.13,  Florida  Statutes.  A  parenting 
 
course may be required prior to entry of a final judgment.  You should contact the clerk, family law 
 
intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses or mediation where you live. 
 
 
 
 
Listed  below  are  some  terms  with  which  you  should  become  familiar  before  completing  your 
 
 
 
supplemental petition.  If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, 
 
you should speak with an attorney before going any further.

Parenting Plan Recommendation 
 
Time-Sharing Schedule 
 
 
Child Support. Both parents are required to provide financial support for their minor or dependent 
children.; however, , the court may order one parent to pay child support to the other parent.  Florida 
has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid.  These guidelines are 
 
based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of 
 
both parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each parent. You must file a 
Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and the 
 
other parent will be required to do the same.  From your financial affidavits, you should be able to 
 
calculate  the  amount  of  child  support  that  should  be  paid  using  the  Child  Support  Guidelines 
 
Worksheet,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of  Procedure  Form  12.902(e).  Because  the  child  support 
 
guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to state, your 
 
child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations. 
 
 
 
Temporary  Relief.  If  you  need  temporary  relief  regarding  parental  responsibility  and  time-sharing 
 
with  child(ren),  child  support  or  alimony,  you  may  file  a  Motion  for  Temporary  Support  with 
 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a) or, if 
 
you need temporary relief regarding alimony and there are no dependent or minor child(ren), you 
 
 
may file a Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme 
 
 
Court Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.947(c).  For more information, see  the instructions for  these 
 
 
forms. 
 
 
 
 
Settlement Agreement.  If you and the other party are able to reach an agreement on any or all of 
 
 
the issues, you should file a Settlement Agreement.  Although there is no form for this in these Florida 
 
Family Law Forms, you may construct a settlement agreement using the pertinent sections contained 
 
in Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), 
 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), or Marital Settlement Agreement for 
 
Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
 
Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2).  Both parties must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy 
 
clerk.  Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the 
 
judge at the final hearing. 
 
Final Judgment Forms.  These family law forms contain a Supplemental Final Judgment Modifying 
 
Parental Responsibility, Visitation, or Parenting Plan/Time-Sharing Schedule or Other Relief, Florida 
 
Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.993(a),  a  Supplemental  Final  Judgment  Modifying 
 
Child Support, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.993(b), and a Supplemental Final 
 
Judgment Modifying Alimony, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.993(c), which 
 
the judge may use, as appropriate. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial 
 
assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing.  If so, you should type 
or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties’ names, and 
 
 
leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial. 
 
 
Nonlawyer.  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
