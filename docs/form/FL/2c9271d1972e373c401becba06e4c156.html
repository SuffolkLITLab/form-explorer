FORM 12.901(a) 
PETITION FOR SIMPLIFIED DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE 
(02/18) 

When should this form be used? 

This form should be used when a husband and wife are filing for a simplified dissolution of 
marriage. You and/or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing 
for a dissolution in Florida. You may file a simplified dissolution of marriage in Florida if all of 
the following are true: 












You and your spouse agree that the marriage cannot be saved.
You and your spouse have no minor or dependent child(ren) together, the wife does not
have any minor or dependent children born during the marriage, and the wife is not
now pregnant.
You and your spouse have worked out how the two of you will divide the things that you
both own (your assets) and who will pay what part of the money you both owe (your
liabilities), and you are both satisfied with this division.
You are not seeking support (alimony) from your spouse, and vice versa.
You are willing to give up your right to trial and appeal.
You and your spouse are both willing to go into the clerk’s office to sign the petition (not
necessarily together).
You and your spouse are both willing to go to the final hearing (at the same time).

If you do not meet the criteria above, you must file a regular petition for dissolution of 
marriage. 

This petition should be typed or printed in black ink. Each of you must sign the petition. 

What should I do next? 

1. After completing this form, you should file it with the clerk of the circuit court in the county

where you live and keep a copy for your records.

You  may  document  your  agreement  by  signing  a  Marital  Settlement  Agreement,  Florida 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(f)(3) and filing it with the clerk of the circuit court 
or you may agree that all of your assets (what you own) and liabilities (what you owe) have 
been disposed of by oral agreement. 

2. You must prove to the court that the husband and/or wife has (have) lived in Florida for more
than 6 months before filing the petition for dissolution of marriage.  Residence can be proved
by:

Instructions for Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.901(a), Petition for Simplified Dissolution of 
Marriage (02/18) 







a valid Florida driver’s license, Florida identification card, or voter registration card issued
to one of you at least 6 months prior to filing for dissolution of marriage; or
the testimony of another person who knows that either you or your spouse has resided
in Florida for more than 6 months and is available to testify in court; or
an affidavit. To prove residence by affidavit, use an Affidavit of Corroborating Witness,
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(i).  This form must be signed
by a person who knows that either you or your spouse has lived in Florida for more than
6  months  before  the  date  that  you  filed  the  petition  for  dissolution  of  marriage.  This
affidavit may be signed in the presence of the clerk of the court or in the presence of a
notary public, who must affix his or her seal at the proper place on the affidavit.

3. You  must  pay  the  appropriate  filing  fees  to  the  clerk  of  the  circuit  court.  If  you  and  your
spouse cannot afford to pay the filing fees, you may fill out an Application for Determination
of Civil Indigent Status, and file it with your petition for  dissolution of marriage. You may
obtain this form from the clerk and he or she will determine whether you are eligible to have
filing fees waived.

4. You will need to complete a Family Court Cover Sheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure

Form 12.928.  The clerk’s office can provide this form.

5. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may either obtain a date and time for a court appearance
from the clerk of court, or a date and time will be provided to you by the court.  On that date,
you and your spouse must appear together before a judge. Depending on your jurisdiction,
you  will  either  complete  a  Final  Judgment  of  Simplified  Dissolution  of  Marriage,  Florida
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.990(a), and bring it with you to the hearing, or the
judge will prepare it at the hearing. At that time, if all of the papers are in order, the judge
may grant a final judgment dissolving your marriage under simplified dissolution of marriage
procedures by signing the final judgment.

6.

If you fail to complete this procedure, the court may dismiss the case to clear its records.

Where can I look for more information? 

Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” 
found at the beginning of these forms. The words that are in “bold underline” in these 
instructions are defined there.  For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes, and 
Rule 12.105, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure. 

Special notes... 

Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill 
out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida
