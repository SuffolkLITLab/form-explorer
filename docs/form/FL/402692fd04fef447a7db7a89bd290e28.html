JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, 
 

IN AND FOR 

                         

COUNTY, FLORIDA 
 

 

Case No.: 
  
Division: 
   

 
 

FINAL JUDGMENT OF INJUNCTION 
  
 
FOR PROTECTION AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
 
WITHOUT MINOR CHILDREN (AFTER NOTICE) 
  

 

 

 
The  Petition  for  Injunction  for  Protection  Against  Domestic  Violence  under  Section  741.30,  Florida 
 
Statutes,  and  other  papers  filed  in  this  Court  have  been  reviewed.  The  Court  has  jurisdiction  of  the 
 
parties and the subject matter. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  intended  that  this  protection  order  meet  the  requirements  of  18  U.S.C.  Section  2265  and 
 
therefore intended that it be accorded full faith and credit by the court of another state or Indian tribe 
 
 
and enforced as if it were the order of the enforcing state or of the Indian tribe. 
 
 
SECTION I.  HEARING 
 
  
 
This  cause  came  before  the  Court  for  a  hearing  to  determine  whether  an  Injunction  for  Protection 
 
Against Domestic Violence in this case should be: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

_____ issued_____ modified _____ extended. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The hearing was attended by: 
   
_____ Petitioner 
  
_____ Petitioner's Counsel 
 
 
_____ Respondent 
 
_____ Respondent’s Counsel 
 
 
SECTION II.  FINDINGS 
 
  
 
On {date} 
,  a  notice  of  this  hearing  was  served  on  Respondent  together 
  
 
 
 
with  a copy of Petitioner’s petition to  this Court and  the  temporary  injunction, if  issued.  Service was 
 
 
within the time required by Florida law, and Respondent was afforded an opportunity to be heard. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

After  hearing  the  testimony  of  each  party  present  and  of  any  witnesses,  or  upon  consent  of 
  
Respondent,  the  Court  finds,  based  on  the  specific  facts  of  this  case,  that  Petitioner  is  a  victim  of 
domestic violence or has reasonable cause to believe that he/she is in imminent danger of becoming a 
 
 
victim of domestic violence by Respondent.

1.  This injunction is valid in all counties of the State of Florida.  Violation of this injunction should 
 
be  reported  to  the  appropriate  law  enforcement  agency.  Law  enforcement  officers  of  the 
 
jurisdiction  in  which  a  violation  of  this  injunction  occurs  shall  enforce  the  provisions  of  this 
 
injunction  and  are  authorized  to  arrest  without  warrant  pursuant  to  section  901.15,  Florida 
 
Statutes, for any violation of its provisions, except those regarding child support and/or alimony, 
 
which constitutes a criminal act under section 741.31, Florida Statutes.  When inconsistent with 
 
this  order,  any  subsequent  court  order  issued  under  Chapter  61,  Florida  Statutes,  shall  take 
 
 
precedence over this order on all matters relating to property division, alimony, child custody, 
 
 
or child support.

3.  Reporting alleged violations.  If Respondent violates the terms of this injunction and there has 
not been an arrest, Petitioner may contact the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the county in which 
 
the violation occurred and complete an affidavit in support of the violation, or Petitioner may 
 
contact the State Attorney’s office for assistance in filing an action for indirect civil contempt or 
 
 
 
 
indirect  criminal  contempt.  Upon  receiving  such  a  report,  the  State  Attorney  is  hereby 
 
 
appointed to prosecute such violations by indirect criminal contempt proceedings, or the State 
 
Attorney may decide to file a criminal charge, if warranted by the evidence.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
