FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE 
  
 
FORM 12.985(b)(2) 
  
COLLABORATIVE LAW PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT (10/20) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The  undersigned  Clients,  __________________________,  and  ______________________________, 
  
hereby  agree  that  they  intend  to  resolve  through  the  Collaborative  Law  Process,  under  Florida’s 
 
Collaborative  Law  Process  Act,  without  the  intervention  of  a  court  or  other  tribunal,  the  following 
 
collaborative matter(s): 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I. BEGINNING AND ENDING THE PROCESS 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The Collaborative Law Process governed by this Agreement begins when they both sign this Agreement. 
 
It concludes upon: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) the resolution of the collaborative matter(s) listed above, as evidenced by a signed record; 
  
 
 
(B)  the  resolution  of  a part  of  the  collaborative  matter(s)  listed above,  evidenced  by  a signed 
 
record, in which we, the Clients, agree that the remaining parts of the matter will not be resolved 
 
in the process; or 
 
(C) the unilateral termination of the Collaborative Law Process, with or without cause, by one of 
 
 
the Clients, as described below in Section VI of this Agreement. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

II. ATTORNEYS 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

A. EACH CLIENT HAS A SEPARATE ATTORNEY. No legal duty, by contract or otherwise, is owed to either 
 
 
Client by the other’s Collaborative attorney. 
  
 
B. ATTORNEYS ARE ENGAGED FOR THIS PROCESS ONLY. The Clients understand that each Collaborative 
 
attorney, and any member of their firm, is disqualified from representing either Client in any adversarial 
 
proceeding  related  to  the  collaborative  matter(s)  listed  above,  except  to  protect  their  Client  in  an 
 
 
emergency until successor counsel is available. The Clients’ Collaborative attorneys may also file required 
status reports, appear at required collaborative case management conferences and assist the Client in 
 
obtaining entry of court orders ratifying temporary or permanent agreements or finalizing a divorce, as 
 
 
these are not adversarial proceedings but part of the Collaborative Law Process. 
  
 
C. WITHDRAWAL OR DISCHARGE. Either Collaborative attorney may withdraw by giving prompt written 
notice to their Client and to any other participants. Either Client may discharge the Collaborative attorney 
 
at  any  time  and  the  Collaborative  attorney  will  give  prompt  written  notice  of  such  discharge  to  all 
 
participants. Upon either the withdrawal or discharge of a Collaborative attorney, the Collaborative Law 
Process will terminate, except as described in Section VI below.

III. OTHER PROFESSIONALS 
 

 

 

 

 
A. IDENTIFICATION OF NONPARTY PARTICIPANTS. The Clients acknowledge that participation of others in 
 
 
the Collaborative Law Process, persons other than the Clients and the Collaborative attorneys, will benefit 
 
 
 
the Clients (“nonparty participants”). They understand that such nonparty participants may include: 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  A  NEUTRAL  FACILITATOR  to  help  us  identify  and  express  the  Clients’  interests  and  concerns, 
 
manage  meetings,  help  the  Clients  and  the  Collaborative  attorneys  and  any  other  nonparty 
 
participants  communicate  effectively  with  one  another,  help  the  Clients  work  together  to 
 
enhance our effectiveness,  help the Clients be more effective parents and to develop a parenting 
 
  
plan for any minor children. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  A  NEUTRAL  FINANCIAL  PROFESSIONAL  to  help  identify  and  articulate  the  Clients’  financial 
 
 
interests and concerns, assist in identifying, cataloging and organizing the information necessary 
 
to  reach  a  resolution  of  financial  issues,  prepare  schedules  to  assist  the  Team  in  better 
 
understanding financial circumstances, and help develop options for resolution of  the  Clients’ 
 
 
 
financial issues. 
 
   

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  OTHERS. The Clients understand that there may be a role for less frequently utilized nonparty 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participants, such as a child specialist, mediator, or separate coach for each Client. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

B. CHANGE OF NONPARTY PARTICIPANTS. Once a nonparty participant is engaged by written agreement, 
 
neither Client may unilaterally discharge that nonparty participant, but removal or replacement of the 
nonparty participant is available if both agree. A nonparty participant may also withdraw by giving written 
 
 
notice to the Clients and the attorneys. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

C. NEUTRAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANTS: The Clients also agree that there may be a role for one or 
more professionals who will not be full participants in the process, an individual consultant, such as an 
 
appraiser, business valuation specialist or other expert who may be neutral or may be engaged to assist 
 
only one of the Clients. Either Client may meet during the process with an individual consultant, but only 
 
if the Clients: (a) each advise the other, and both attorneys and any nonparty participants, in advance of 
each meeting with any individual consultant, (b) disclose the identity of and purpose for the individual 
 
consultant, and (c) instruct the individual consultant to follow the spirit and direction of the Collaborative 
 
Law  Process.  The  Collaborative  Team  may  share  information  and  schedules  that  are  subject  to  the 
 
privilege and confidentiality protections of this Agreement with an individual consultant only upon the 
 
individual consultant’s written agreement to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement. 
 
An  individual  consultant  may  be  an  attorney.  An  attorney  individual  consultant  with  whom  a  Client 
 
consults  during  the  Collaborative  Law  Process  is  considered  to  be  an  adjunct  Collaborative  attorney 
 
subject to the disqualification provisions of this Agreement. Either Client may consult with mental health 
 
or health care professionals for his or her own therapy, diagnosis, or treatment without disclosure to the 
 
other Client and without any limitation. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D.  EFFECT  OF  CONCLUSION  OF  THE  PROCESS:  Maximizing  free  communication  among  Clients, 
 
 
Collaborative attorneys and nonparty participants is fundamental to the Collaborative Law Process. Also 
 
fundamental is a limitation on the roles of the professionals such that all their efforts are focused solely 
 
on  assisting  the  Clients  in  crafting  an  out-of-court  resolution.  Therefore,  upon  the  conclusion  of  the 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.985(b)(2), Collaborative Law Participation Agreement (10/20) 
 
 
- 2 -
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Collaborative  Law  Process,  their nonparty  participants,  and employees or members of their firms,  are 
 
disqualified from assisting either Client in any manner except as specified in this Agreement. A neutral 
 
nonparty participant may assist the Clients in a neutral or joint capacity after successful resolution of their 
 
collaborative matter if: (a) both of the Clients agree in writing, (b) the neutral nonparty participant agrees 
 
 
in writing, and (c) the written agreement specifies the nature of the neutral assistance to be provided. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IV. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVILEGE 
 

 

 

A. CONFIDENTIALITY.  Because  maximizing free  communication among  Clients,  Collaborative  attorneys, 
 
and  nonparty  participants  is  fundamental  to  the  Collaborative  Law  Process,  all  collaborative  law 
 
 
 
communications, written, oral, nonverbal or otherwise, are agreed to be confidential. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B. PRIVILEGE. Although evidence or information that is otherwise admissible or subject to discovery does 
 
 
not  become  inadmissible  or  protected  from  discovery  solely  because  of  its  disclosure  or  use  in  the 
 
Collaborative Law Process, the Clients understand that all communications during this process, whether 
written, oral, nonverbal or otherwise, are privileged except as specified by the Florida Family Law Rules 
of  Procedure  and  Florida  law.  They  acknowledge  that  this  means  that  such  communications  are  not 
 
subject  to  discovery,  and  are  not  admissible  into  evidence.  Further,  in  an  adversarial  proceeding,  the 
 
 
following privileges apply: 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  Either  Client  may  refuse  to  disclose,  and  may  prevent  another  person  from  disclosing,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collaborative law communication. 
 

2.  A nonparty participant may refuse to disclose, and may prevent another person from disclosing, 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a collaborative law communication of a nonparty participant. 
 

 

 

V. CLIENTS’ ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
 

 

 

 

 

A. They acknowledge that the respective Collaborative attorneys have each separately spent time with 
 
the Clients providing sufficient and detailed information about the Collaborative Law Process, including, 
 
but not limited to, the following: 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the benefits and risks of the Collaborative Law Process to resolve a family law matter; 
  

 

 

 

 

 

the nature and scope of the matter to be resolved through the Collaborative Law Process; 
   

 

 

 

 

the material benefits and risks of participating in the Collaborative Law Process; 
   

 

 

 

 

 
•  alternatives to the Collaborative Law Process; 
  

 

 

that  participation  in  the  Collaborative  Law  Process  is  voluntary  and  that  either  Client  may 
 
unilaterally terminate the process at any time for any reason; 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Collaborative Law Process will terminate if either Client initiates a proceeding, or seeks 
 
tribunal  intervention  in  a  pending  proceeding,  related  to  their  collaborative  matter  after  this 
 
Agreement; 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the limitations on respective attorneys’ participation in subsequent proceedings imposed by the 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure; and

the fees and costs each Client can reasonably expect to incur in  the Collaborative Law Process, 
 
including  the  fees  of  their  Collaborative  attorney  and  any  participating  mental  health 
 
professionals and financial professionals. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B. The Clients acknowledge that if a resolution is reached using the Collaborative Law Process, the Clients 
 
 
will be giving up rights available in a litigated divorce, including the right to conduct formal discovery, 
 
 
participate in adversarial court hearings, and have a judge decide the outcome of the divorce. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

C. Further, the Clients understand that the Collaborative Law Process: 
 
 

 

 

 

 
•  does not guarantee successful resolution; 
   
 

 

 

 
• 

 
• 

 
• 

 

cannot eliminate concerns about disharmony, distrust, and irreconcilable differences that have 
led to their conflict or dispute; 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not designed to address therapeutic or mental health issues; 
  

 

 

 

 

 

is  voluntary  and,  despite  their  best  efforts,  the  Clients  may  not  reach  a  mutually  acceptable 
 
settlement; and 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  may be terminated by either of the Clients at any time for any or no cause or reason. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D. Further, the Clients understand that if resolution in the Collaborative Law Process is not successfully 
 
 
reached,  the  Clients  will  incur  additional  time  and  expense  to  obtain  different  professionals  and 
 
commencing litigation, since the Collaborative attorneys, nonparty participants, and their respective firms 
will be discharged and disqualified. The Clients understand that they might feel pressure to settle to avoid 
 
 
this result and the additional costs. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E. The Clients acknowledge that they are expected to assert their own interests. Although each attorney 
 
 
represents the Client’s interests, each Client is responsible for making sure their respective interests are 
expressed and considered. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

F.  The  Clients  acknowledge  that  they  are  responsible  for  deciding  the  scope  and  degree  of  any  work 
 
performed by any nonparty participant or consultant, including if the Clients decide that it is not necessary 
 
 
 
or appropriate to have a professional perform work with the same level of detail as would be required or 
 
expected in a litigated proceeding. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

G.  The  Clients  agree  that  they  will  not  seek  in-court  remedies  or  court  intervention  during  the 
 
Collaborative Law Process and shall suspend any existing action that may have been filed. This will not 
 
prevent the Clients from filing signed temporary agreements or agreeing to other actions consistent with 
 
 
the Collaborative Law Process and this Agreement. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H. The Clients acknowledge that for the Collaborative Law Process to be successful, the Clients must each 
 
 
participate and negotiate in good faith. At a minimum, the Client will: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  provide timely, candid, full, and transparent financial disclosures, even if specific documents are 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
not requested; 
   

 

 
• 

continuously update financial disclosures, whether asked to do so or not;

- 4 -
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• 

sign any releases necessary to obtain relevant information; 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  not threaten litigation to obtain an advantage or achieve a desired result; 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  maintain the financial and parenting status quo unless a written agreement varies the status quo; 
 
   

 

 

 

 

 

isolate their children from any conflict between them; 
   
 

 

 

refrain from unproductive repetitive discussions; 
   

 

 

 
• 

 
• 

 
• 

 
•  use respectful language when speaking with each other during team meetings; and 
   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consult  with  the  respective  Collaborative  attorney  before  taking  any  action  even  potentially 
 
inconsistent with any part of this Agreement. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I.  The  Clients  acknowledge  that  meetings  with  multiple  professionals  can  be  costly.  Each  Client  has  a 
responsibility to provide requested documents in a timely manner and otherwise fully prepare for the 
 
 
meetings to keep the process efficient. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

J.  The  Clients  acknowledge  that fees  differ  among  various  attorneys  and law  firms,  as  do the  Client’s 
 
 
individual needs. As a result, the Clients should expect their individual fees to differ, perhaps substantially. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

K. The Clients understand that any agreements reached in the process are not legally binding unless in 
 
 
writing and signed by both Clients. Meeting notes are confidential, privileged, and not binding, but simply 
 
 
memorialize the discussions during their meetings. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VI. TERMINATION 
 

 

A. Participation in the Collaborative Law Process is voluntary. Thus, either Client can terminate the process 
 
at any time, with or without cause. 
  
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B. Termination occurs if either Client: 
 

 

 

(i) gives notice to the other in a record that the process is ended; 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) begins a contested proceeding related to the Collaborative matter without the agreement of 
 
 
the other Client; or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) in a pending proceeding related to the matter: (a) initiates a pleading, motion, order to show 
 
cause, or request for a conference with the court; (b) requests that the proceeding be put on the 
 
 
court’s active calendar; or (c) takes similar action requiring notice to be sent; or 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) discharges a Collaborative attorney from further representation of one Client, unless he or 
she retains a successor Collaborative attorney within 30 days of the written notice of discharge 
 
or; in a signed record both Clients consent to continue the process by reaffirming this Agreement; 
 
and this Agreement is amended to identify the successor Collaborative attorney and the successor 
 
Collaborative attorney signs the amended Agreement.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
