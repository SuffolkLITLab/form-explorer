INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE FORM 
 
12.996(a), INCOME DEDUCTION ORDER (10/21) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

This form should be used in all cases when the court has ordered that support be paid by the obligor’s 
 
 
 
payor through an income deduction order. 
 
 
This form includes several blanks that must be filled in as applicable. The obligor is the person who is 
 
 
obligated to pay the support ordered by the court and the obligee is the person entitled to receive the 
 
 
support awarded by the court. 
 
 
In Paragraph 1, one of the three lines must be checked off. The court order that establishes the support 
 
award and/or the settlement or mediation agreement entered into between the parties should state the 
 
effective date of the Income Deduction Order. The appropriate effective date should be checked off in 
 
 
Paragraph 1. 
 
 
The blank lines in Paragraph 2 should be completed tracking the same terms of support as are in the court 
 
order that establishes the support award and/or the settlement or mediation agreement.  The first blank 
 
 
in each line should state the amount of the support payment and the second blank in each line should 
 
 
state the time period that covers said support award.  For example, if the child support is $100 per month 
 
  
the first blank would say $ “100” and the second blank in that line would say “month”.  Similarly, if the 
 
payments are to be payable weekly, then the second blank would say “week”.  If there are any arrearages 
 
 
owed at the time the Income Deduction Order is entered, they must be included in the line for arrears, 
 
along with the amount and frequency of the payments due for the arrears, which must be no less than 
 
20% of the current support obligation. All orders for immediate income deduction must be paid through 
 
 
the State Disbursement Unit. The actual dollar amount of the Clerk’s fee for the support awarded in your 
 
case (4% of each payment not to exceed $5.25 per payment) must be included on the appropriate line. 
 
 
 
Paragraph 6 must be completed to show what percentage, if any, of a one-time payment made to the 
 
 
obligor should be applied to any arrearage in support that may be due to the obligee. 
 
  
 
 
If the Income Deduction Order is addressing child support, you must complete the schedule in paragraph 
 
 
7 to show the amount of child support for all the minor children at the time of the entry of this order and 
 
 
the amount of the child support that will be owed for any remaining child(ren) after one or more of the 
 
children are no longer entitled to receive child support. You should also show in the schedule the day, 
 
month, and year that the child support obligation terminates for each minor child. The date child support 
 
terminates should be listed as the child’s 18th birthday unless the court has found that section 743.07(2), 
 
Florida Statues, applies, or the parties have otherwise agreed to  a different date. You should use the 
 
record existing at the time of this order for the basis of computing all child support obligations. 
 
 
 
 
If the Income Deduction Order is addressing child support, you must also complete and attach the federal 
 
INCOME WITHHOLDING FOR SUPPORT (IWO) FORM (OMB Form 0970-0154) to the Income Deduction 
 
 
Order.  When filling out an Income Withholding for Support Form, please note the following additional 
 
 
 
instructions for that form:

Where can I look for more information? 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, 
 
and documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file 
 
petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If 
 
you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with 
 
Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of 
 
the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all documents 
 
 
required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except 
 
 
 
in certain circumstances.  You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules 
 
 
of General Practice and Judicial Administration.  If you elect to participate in electronic service, which 
 
 
means serving or receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing 
 
 
Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find 
 
this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
 
Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the A-Z 
 
 
 
 
Topical Index. 
  
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made.
