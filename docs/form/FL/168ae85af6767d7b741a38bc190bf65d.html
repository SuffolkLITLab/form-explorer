This form is to be used with Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage (No Child or Financial 
 
 
Support), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a)(1) and Notice of Action For 
 
 
 
Family Cases With Minor Child(ren), Form 12.913(a)(2), to obtain constructive service (also called 
 
service by publication). 
 
 
The other party is entitled to actual notice of the proceedings when possible.  When it is necessary to 
 
 
use constructive notice, it must be given in a way that is likely to provide actual notice.  You must 
 
 
disclose the last known address of the other party.  A last known address cannot be unknown. This form 
 
 
  
includes a checklist of places you can look for information on the location of the other party.  While you 
 
 
do not have to look in all of these places, the court must believe that you have made a very serious 
 
 
 
effort to get information about the other party’s location and that you have followed up on any 
 
 
 
information you received. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form. 
  
You should file this document and a Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage (No Child or Financial

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, 
 
 
pleadings, and documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented 
 
 
litigants may file petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not 
 
 
required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so 
 
 
in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must 
 
 
follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be 
 
 
carefully read and followed.

After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all 
 
 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-
 
 
mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth 
 
 
in the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in 
 
 
electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the 
 
 
 
Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
 
Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of General 
 
 
 
Practice and Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
 
 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
  
 
SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MAY SERVE DOCUMENTS BY E-MAIL; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT 
 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by email, the 
 
 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
  
 
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. 
 
 
Please CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme 
 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial 
 
 
Administration 2.516.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
