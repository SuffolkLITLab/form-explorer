      <pre>UNLAWFUL DETAINER 
(not Eviction) 

USE THIS PACKET IF: 

1) YOU ARE TRYING TO REMOVE SOMEONE FROM YOUR HOME,  and

2) YOU HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO RESIDE IN YOUR HOME (YOU ARE THE

OWNER OR ARE THE LEGAL TENANT), and

3) THE PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO REMOVE DOES NOT HAVE A LEGAL

RIGHT TO RESIDE IN YOUR HOME (THEY ARE NOT AN OWNER OR A LEGAL
TENANT), and

4) THERE IS NO AGREEMENT FOR RENT (VERBAL OR IN WRITING)

BETWEEN YOU AND THE PERSON YOU ARE TRYING TO REMOVE.

Unlawful Detainer is a county court lawsuit, filed pursuant to Florida Statute Chapter 82, to request that 
another person be ordered to leave your property. It is similar to an eviction proceeding except that in an 
Unlawful  Detainer  case,  there  is  no  landlord/tenant  relationship  between  the  parties,  i.e.  there  is  no 
agreement to pay rent, either verbal or in writing. If there is an agreement to pay rent, verbal or in writing, 
you should consider filing an eviction case. Consult with an attorney if you are not sure.

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS 

STEP 1 - Complete the forms to start the case 
Complete the "Unlawful Detainer Complaint" and the "Unlawful Detainer Summons" forms. Complete the 
Civil Cover Sheet form. You are the Plaintiff and the person you want removed from your property is the 
Defendant. You will be given a Case Number and Division when you file the case with the County Clerk's 
office. All completed forms are filed with the Clerk's office, Customer Service Center, 2075 Monroe Street 
Fort Myers, FL 33901. 

STEP 2 - Notary 
Sign the "Unlawful Detainer Complaint" in front of a notary. The clerk's office will notarize documents for a 
fee. 

STEP 3 - Make copies 
Make at least 3 additional copies of the completed Complaint and Summons and Civil Cover Sheet (1 copy for 
you, 1 copy to be delivered to the Defendant and 1 copy for mailing. If previous address is known, an extra 
copy will be needed). Copies can be obtained for a fee in the Clerk of Court Self-Help Center, 1700 Monroe 
Street Fort Myers, FL 33901. 

STEP 4 - Filing your case 
Take the original Complaint and Summons and Civil Cover Sheet to the County Clerk's office. The Clerk will 
charge a filing fee. The Clerk will issue the Summons and give it back to you. 

STEP 5 - Notifying the other party (Defendant) 
The Summons must be served by either the Sheriff or a Certified Process Server. Take the Summons and one 
copy of the complaint to the Sheriff’s office and pay the fee to have the Defendant served. Lee County Sheriff’s 
Civil Process is located at 2072 Victoria Avenue, Fort Myers, FL 33901.  A non-refundable fee is required (only 
cash, cashier's checks or money orders -- no personal checks). 

STEP 6 - After the Defendant is served 
After the Summons is served to the Defendant, the Defendant has five (5) working days to file a response 
regarding the case. (Do not count the day of service, Saturdays, Sundays or observed legal holidays.) After 5 
working days have passed, the paperwork to complete the case may be filed. 

If the Defendant filed an answer, and is not in the military, complete the Non-Military Affidavit form 
(must be notarized) and a request for a hearing in the Clerk's office. There is no form for this. You may use 
a plain piece of paper to write your request. Make sure you include the case number and the names of the 
parties.  You must contact the Judicial Assistant for information about the requested hearing.

If the Defendant did not file an answer, and is not in the military, complete the following forms and 
take them to the County Clerk's office. (If the Defendant did not file an answer and is in the military, 
STOP HERE and consult an attorney.)

a. Motion for Default & Default
b. Non-Military Affidavit (must be notarized)
c. Judgment for Possession
d. Writ of Possession (to be filed after Judgment is signed and requires one copy and one original)
e. Final Disposition Form
The Clerk will file your documents and take the Judgment for Possession to the Judge to be signed. Once
the Judgment for Possession is signed by the Judge, the Clerk can issue the Writ of Possession. The
Sheriff’s office charges a fee to execute the Writ of Possession and remove the Defendant.

STEP 8 - Attending a hearing? What to expect 

If the Defendant filed an answer and you have filed a request for a hearing, you must contact the Judicial 
Assistant.  The hearing will take place in a hearing room or a courtroom or Zoom. You will not be in front of a 
jury, just the general magistrate or judge. Do not interrupt the magistrate or judge when he or she speaks. When 
speaking to the magistrate or judge, address him or her as "Your Honor" or "Judge." 

Each court has at least one bailiff who is a deputy sheriff and is there to maintain order. When you arrive for 
your hearing, let the bailiff know that you are present and ready. He or she will announce your case when it is 
time for your hearing, and will tell you where to sit and where to place your belongings as you enter the hearing 
room. A bailiff will usually remain inside the room during your hearing. If witnesses are called, the bailiff will 
step out to bring the witness into the hearing room. 

At your hearing, be prepared to discuss any issues covered in the complaint and be able to provide proof of any 
disputed facts by presenting evidence. Evidence is proof presented at a hearing in the form of witnesses 
(people), exhibits (documents), and objects (things). Not all evidence can be considered by the judge, however. 
Evidence must conform to the Rules of Evidence in Chapter 90 of the Florida Statutes to be admissible in court. 
Remember, the duty of establishing the facts that you want to present to the court is on YOU. You should 
provide the judge with admissible evidence to support the claims in your complaint and your statements in 
court. Telling your story may not be enough to win your case. Once both sides have presented their evidence, 
the judge will make a decision. If the Judge signs a Judgment for Possession, the Clerk can issue the Writ of 
Possession once received by the clerk. The Sheriff’s office charges a fee to execute the Writ of Possession and 
remove the Defendant.
