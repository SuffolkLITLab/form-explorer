      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED 
 
  
FAMILY LAW FORM 12.975(a) 
 
PETITION FOR GRANDPARENT VISITATION WITH MINOR CHILD(REN) 
 
(03/23) 
 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

This form should be used when a grandparent is filing for visitation rights as provided in Section 752.011, 
 
Florida Statutes. You may file a petition for grandparent visitation with minor child(ren) in Florida if one 
 
of the following is true: 
  

 

 

 

 

 

•  One or both of the minor child(ren)’s parents died; 
  
 
•  One or both of the minor child(ren)’s parents are missing; 
  
 
•  One or both of the minor child(ren)’s parents are in a persistent vegetative state; or a 
 
 

 
 

 

 

combination of these three situations. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

If only one of the minor child(ren)’s parents qualifies in one of the three categories above, the other parent 
 
must have been convicted of a felony or an offense of violence evincing behavior that poses a substantial 
 
 
 
threat of harm to the minor child’s health or welfare. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This petition should be typed or printed in black ink. 
  

What should I do next? 
 

 

After completing this form, you should file this form with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where 
 
 
 
you live and keep a copy for your records. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

You  must  file  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.902(d),  Uniform  Child  Custody 
 
Jurisdiction and Enforcement Affidavit. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

You must pay the appropriate filing fees to the clerk of the circuit court. If you cannot afford to pay the 
 
 
filing fees, you may fill out an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status, and file it with your 
 
petition for Grandparent Visitation with Minor Child(ren). You may obtain this form from the clerk and he 
 
 
or she will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees waived. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Either you or the clerk of court will need to complete a Family Court Cover Sheet, Florida Family Law Rules 
 
of Procedure Form 12.928. The clerk’s office can provide this form. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the parents of the minor child(ren) unless they have 
 
 
died. If either or both parents have died, you must file a certified copy of the death certificate. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you know where either or both parents live, you should use personal service. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

If the basis of your petition is that one or both parents are missing, you must file an affidavit of diligent 
 
search with regard to that parent(s) to demonstrate to the court that one or both are in fact missing. See 
 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.975(a), Petition for Grandparent Visitation 
 
with Minor Child(ren) (03/23) 
 

 

 

 

 

If you absolutely do not know where one or both parents live, you may also use constructive service. You 
 
may also be able to use constructive service if one or both parents reside in another state or country. For 
 
more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Family Cases with Minor Child(ren), 
 
Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.913(a)(2),  and  Affidavit  of  Diligent  Search  and 
 
 
Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The parents will have 20 days to answer your petition after being served with your petition. Your case will 
 
 
 
then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DEFAULT. If after 20 days, none of the parties have filed an answer or any other document, you 
 
may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with 
 
the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, depending on your jurisdiction, 
 
you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or the judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You 
 
must  notify  the  parents  of  the  hearing  by  using  a  Notice  of  Final  Hearing  (General),  Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

UNCONTESTED.  If  all  parties  file  an  answer  that  agrees  with  everything  in  your  petition, 
 
depending on your jurisdiction, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant 
 
to schedule a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of 
 
 
Final  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
 
appropriate notice of hearing form. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CONTESTED. If any of the parties file an answer, which disagrees with or denies anything in your 
 
petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Unless the reason for  filing the petition is that both parents have  died, some circuits may require the 
 
completion of mediation before a final hearing may be scheduled. Depending on your jurisdiction, you 
 
 
should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your 
 
case for trial (final hearing) and to inquire if mediation is required before a final hearing. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You must obtain a date and time for any court appearance, including the final hearing, from the clerk of 
 
court, family law intake staff or judicial assistant. On that date of the hearing, all petitioners must appear 
 
before a judge. If required by your jurisdiction, you should bring an Order On Grandparent’s Petition for 
  
Visitation with Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.975(c), with you 
 
to the hearing. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you fail to complete this procedure, the court may dismiss the case. 
 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
beginning of these forms. The words that are in “bold underline” in these instructions are defined there. 
 
For further information, see chapter 752, Florida Statutes, and Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Rule

petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If 
you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with 
 
Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of 
 
the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

receive documents by e-mail, the procedures must always be followed once that election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
