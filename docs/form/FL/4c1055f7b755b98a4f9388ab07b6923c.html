FORM 12.944(a), 
 
MOTION FOR TESTIMONY AND ATTENDANCE OF MINOR CHILD(REN) 
(11/15) 
 

 

 

 

 
When should this form be used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
Rule  12.407,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules,  provides  that  minor  children  may  not  be  deposed  (have  their 
 
deposition taken),  brought  to  court  to  appear as a  witness  or to  attend a  hearing, or  subpoenaed to 
 
appear at a hearing without prior order of the court. This rule applies in all cases except when there is 
 
 
an  emergency  or  the  case  is  an  uncontested  adoption.  You  should  use  this  form  to  request  that  the 
 
 
court enter an order authorizing a minor child(ren) to appear at a court proceeding. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should file the original 
  
 
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your case is filed and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
A  copy  of this  form  must  be  mailed,  e-mailed, or  hand  delivered to  any  other party(ies)  in  your  case, 
 
including the guardian ad litem, if one has been appointed. 
 
 
It is possible that there will be a hearing on your motion. The judge may want to hear the reasons you feel 
 
this motion should be granted, or the other party may object to your motion. If a hearing is required, 
 
check with the clerk of court, judicial assistant, or family law intake staff for information on the local 
 
 
procedure for scheduling a hearing. When you know the date and time of your hearing, you should file 
 
 
Notice  of  Hearing  (General),Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
 
appropriate notice of hearing form, and provide a copy to any other party. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
  
 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms. For further information, see rule 12.407, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
