When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
This form should be used by a birth mother or father to ask the court to establish paternity, a time-sharing 
 
 
schedule, and/or  child  support  of  a minor  child or children.  This means that you are trying to  legally 
 
establish who is the father of the child(ren). 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
 
 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
   

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
 
 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances.  Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
  
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of  Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances.  You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial

the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the respondent of the petition. 
If you know where 
   
 
 
he or she lives, you should use personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, 
 
 
you  may  use  constructive  service.  However,  if  constructive  service  is  used,  the  court  may  only  grant 
 
limited  relief.  You  should  seek  legal  advice  on  constructive  service  in  a  paternity  case.  For  more 
 
information  see  chapter  49,  Florida  Statutes,  or  you  may  contact  Child  Support  Enforcement  at  the 
 
 
Florida Department of Revenue if you need assistance with your case. 
 
 
 
If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. 
 
Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 
 
 
DEFAULT...  If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme 
 
Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.922(a),  with  the  clerk  of court.  Then,  if you  have  filed  all of the 
 
required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. 
You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearingform. 
 
 
UNCONTESTED...  If  the  respondent  files  an  answer  that  agrees  with  everything  in  your  petition  or  an 
 
answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, 
 
you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify 
 
 
the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
CONTESTED... If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with 
 
or denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a 
 
Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with 
 
mandatory disclosure, completed the scientific paternity testing, if necessary, and filed all of the required 
 
papers.  Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on 
 
how to set your case for trial (final hearing). If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you 
 
should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme 
 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(d). 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
beginning  of  these  forms.  The  words  that  are  in  “bold  underline”  in  these  instructions  are  defined 
 
 
there. For further information, see chapter 742, Florida Statutes. 
  
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Special notes... 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of 
 
Civil Indigent Status, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees 
 
deferred. 
 
 
 
More than one child of the same alleged father may be listed on a single petition.  However, if you are 
 
filing a paternity action involving more than one possible father, a separate petition must be filed for each

alleged father. 
 
 
If the respondent files an answer denying that the person named in the petition is the child(ren)’s father, 
 
one of you should file a Motion for Scientific Paternity Testing, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
 
 
Law  Form  12.983(e).  This  is  used  to  ask  the  court  to  order  a  scientific  test  to  determine  who  is  the 
 
child(ren)’s father. 
 
 
 
If the father signed papers at the hospital acknowledging that he was the father, paternity was established 
 
as a matter of law.  This should be indicated on page 2, section 9a on this form. 
 
 
If the paternity of a child who was conceived or born during a marriage is at issue, the court may appoint 
 
a guardian ad litem to assist the court in this matter and to protect the rights of child. 
 
 
With this petition, you must file the following and provide a copy to the other party:

Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing.  If the parties are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a 
 
 
time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide as part of establishing a Parenting Plan.  The judge will decide 
 
the  parenting  arrangements  and  time-sharing  based  on  the  child(ren)’s  best  interests;  Regardless  of 
 
whether  there  is  an  agreement  between  the  parties,  the  court  reserves  jurisdiction  to  modify  issues 
 
relating to minor or dependent child(ren).  The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or 
 
appoint a guardian ad litem in your case.  This means that a neutral person will review your situation 
 
 
and report to the judge concerning parenting issues.  The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that 
 
the  best  interests of  the  child(ren)  are being  served.  For more  information,  you may  consult  sections 
 
61.401–61.405, FloridaStatutes. 
 
 
 
Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition.  If 
 
 
 
you do not fully  understand any  of the terms below  or their implications, you should speak with an

Many circuits require that parents of a minor or dependent child(ren) who are involved in dissolution or 
 
paternity actions attend mediation before being allowed to schedule a final hearing.  A parenting course 
 
 
must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment.  You should check with your local clerk of court’s 
 
office,  family  law  intake  staff,  or  judicial  assistant  for  more  information  on  the  parenting  course  and 
 
mediation requirements in your area. 
 
 
 
The  court  may  order  one  parent  to  pay  child  support  to  assist  the  other  parent  in 
Child  Support. 
 
 
meeting  the  child(ren)’s  material  needs;  Both  parents  are  required  to  provide  financial  support,  but 
 
one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. 
 
Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid.  These guidelines 
 
are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of 
 
both parents.  You should file a financial affidavit, and the other parent will be required to do the same. 
 
 
From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be 
 
paid. Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and 
 
vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in 
 
seemingly similar situations. 
 
 
Final Judgments.  These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Paternity, Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.983(g), which the judge may use.  You should check with the clerk, family 
 
 
 
   
 
law intake  staff, or judicial assistant  to  see  if you need to  bring it with you to  the hearing. 
If so, you 
 
 
 
 
should  type or  print  the  heading,  including the  circuit,  county,  case  number,  division,  and the  parties’ 
 
names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial. 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.  If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms, that  person must  give you a copy of a  Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law  Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
 
he or she helps you complete.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
