pleadings, and documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-
 
represented litigants may file petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; 
 
 
 
however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other 
 
 
 
documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice 
 
 
and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in 
 
 
which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

served by electronic mail (e‐mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
