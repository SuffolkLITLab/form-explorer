JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, 
 
COUNTY, FLORIDA 
 

  
Case No.: 
   
Division:

TEMPORARY INJUNCTION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST REPEAT VIOLENCE 
  
 
The Petition for Injunction for Protection Against Repeat Violence under section 784.046, Florida 
Statutes, and other papers filed in this Court have been reviewed.  Under the laws of Florida, the Court 
 
has jurisdiction of the petitioner and the subject matter and has jurisdiction of the respondent upon 
 
service of the temporary injunction.  The term Petitioner as used in this injunction includes the person 
 
on whose behalf this injunction is entered. 
 
 
It is intended that this protection order meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. Section 2265 and 
 
 
therefore intended that it be accorded full faith and credit by the court of another state or Indian tribe 
 
and enforced as if it were the order of the enforcing state or of the Indian tribe.

Honorable {name} 
  
 
at {room name/number, location, address, city} 
 
______________________________________________________________________________,  Florida.

extended,  or  dismissed,  and/or  additional  orders  may  be  granted,  including  entry  of  a  permanent 
 
 
injunction and the imposition of court costs.  All witnesses and evidence, if any, must be presented at 
 
 
  
this time.  Petitioner and Respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction or order issued at 
 
the final hearing. 
 
 
 
IF EITHER PETITIONER OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, HE OR SHE WILL BE 
 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER.
