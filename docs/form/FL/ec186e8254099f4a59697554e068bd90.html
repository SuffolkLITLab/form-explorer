To  initiate  a  civil  contempt/enforcement  proceeding  against  a  party  who  has  relocated  with  a  child

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
 
filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule 
 
of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you 
 
file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
circumstances.  You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Rules  of 
 
 
Judicial Administration.  If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving 
 
pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or  through  the  Florida  Courts  E-Filing  Portal,  you  must  review 
 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link 
 
to the Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form

12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your  signature  appears. 
  
 
Please CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme 
 
Court  Approved Family Law  Form 12.914;  Designation of  Current  Mailing  and E-mail Address,  Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration2.516. 
 
 
A copy of this form must be personally served by a sheriff or private process server or mailed*, e-mailed* 
or hand delivered to any other party(ies) in your case.  *Please note that if notice is mailed or e-mailed, 
 
the court in certain circumstances may not consider mailing or e-mailing to be adequate notice.  If you 
 
 
want to be sure, you should have the motion personally served.  This is a technical area of the law; if you 
 
have any questions about it, you should consult a lawyer.  For more information on personal service, see 
 
the instructions for Summons: Personal Service on an Individual, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
 
 
Form 12.910(a). 
 
 
 
The court will then set a hearing. You should check with the clerk of court, judicial assistant, or family law 
 
 
intake staff for information on the local procedure for scheduling a hearing.  Once you know the time 
 
 
and  date  of  the  hearing,  you  will  need  to  complete  Notice  of  Hearing  on  Motion  for 
 
Contempt/Enforcement,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.961,  Florida  Supreme 
 
 
Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.921,  or  Order  of  Referral  to  General  Magistrate,  Florida  Family 
Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.920(b), which will specify a time and place for a hearing on the issue.  A 
 
 
copy of the form you used to schedule the hearing must be mailed, e-mailed, or hand-delivered to the 
 
other party.  Again, if notice is mailed or e-mailed, the court in certain circumstances may not consider 
 
that to be adequate notice.  If you want to be sure, you should have the notice personally served.  This is 
 
a technical area of the law; if you have any questions about it, you should consult a lawyer.  For more 
 
 
information on personal service, see the instructions for Summons: Personal Service on an Individual, 
 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.910(a). 
 
 
 
At the hearing, as in other civil proceedings, you, as the party seeking contempt or return of children, will 
 
have the burden of proof.  The other party will have an opportunity to put on defenses, if any apply.  If 
 
the  judge  finds  the  other  party  to  be  in  willful  contempt  or  in  violation  of  Section  61.13001,  Florida 
 
Statutes, the judge may order appropriate sanctions to compel compliance or return of the child(ren) by 
the  other  party,  including  jail,  payment  of  attorneys’  fees,  suit  money,  court  costs,  coercive  or 
 
  
compensatory fines, and may order any other relief permitted by law.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
