(02/18) 
 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

When should this form be used? 
 
 
 
This form should be used when a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage with Property but no Dependent 
 
or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.901(b)(2), has been filed and 
the parties have reached an agreement on some or all of the issues at hand. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  Both parties must sign the agreement and have their 
 
signatures witnessed by a notary public or deputy clerk.  After completing this form, you should file the 
 
original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for 
 
your  records.  You  should  then  refer  to  the  instructions  for  your  petition,  answer,  or  answer  and 
 
counterpetition concerning the procedures for setting a hearing or trial (final hearing). 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
 

 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. 
  
For  further  information,  see  chapter  61,  Florida  Statutes,  and  the  instructions  for  the  petition  and/or 
 
answer that were filed in this case. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
 
Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2), Marital Settlement Agreement for 
 
Dissolution of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (02/18) 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

     

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Special notes... 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 
 
This  form  does  not  act  to  transfer  title  to  the  property.  Such  transfer  must  be  done  by  deed  or 
 
supplemental final judgment. 
 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
 
he or she helps you complete.

We, {Petitioner’s full legal name}_____________________________________, and {Respondent’s full 
 
legal name} __________________________________________, being sworn, certify that the following 
 
statements are true: 
 

 

 

 

 
	 
	 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	 
	 

1.	  We were married to each other on {date} 
  
 
2.	  Because of irreconcilable differences in our marriage (no chance of staying together), we have 
made this agreement to settle once and for all what we owe to each other and what we can 
 
expect to receive from each other.  Each of us states that nothing has been held back, that we 
have honestly included everything we could think of in listing our assets (everything we own and 
 
that is owed to us) and our debts (everything we owe), and that we believe the other has been 
 
open and honest in writing this agreement. 
 

 
. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	 
	 

 
3.	  We have both filed a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
12.902(b) or (c).  Because we have voluntarily made full and fair disclosure to each other of all 
 
our assets and debts, we waive any further disclosure under rule 12.285, Florida Family Law 
 
Rules of Procedure. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
4.	  Each of us agrees to execute and exchange any papers that might be needed to complete this 

 
	 
	 

 

 
agreement, including deeds, title certificates, etc. 

 
SECTION I.  MARITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

  

 
	 
	 

A.	  Division of Assets.  We divide our assets (everything we own and that is owed to us) as follows:  Any 
 
 
personal item(s) not listed below is the property of the party currently in possession of the item(s).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
