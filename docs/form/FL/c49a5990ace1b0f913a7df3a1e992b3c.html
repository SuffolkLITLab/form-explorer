IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 
 

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the

SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
  

 
 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse and every other person entitled to access 
or time-sharing with the child(ren) of the petition.  “Other Person” means an individual who is not the 
 
 
 
 
parent but with whom the child resides pursuant to court order, or who has the right of access to, time-
 
If  you  know  where  your  spouse  lives,  you  should  use 
sharing  with,  or  visitation  with  the  child(ren). 
 
personal  service.  If  you  absolutely  do  not  know  where  your  spouse  lives,  you  may  use  constructive 
 
service.  You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse or the other person resides in 
 
another state or country.  However, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court 
 
 
may  only  grant  limited  relief.  For  more  information  on  constructive  service,  see  Notice  of  Action  for 
 
Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a), and Affidavit of 
 
Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b).  If your spouse is in 
 
the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for example, 
 
Memorandum  for  Certificate  of  Military  Service,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form 
 
12.912(a). In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service 
 
is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues. 
 
  
 
If personal service is used, the respondent has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. 
 
Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 
 
DEFAULT. If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed all 
 
of the required papers, you may contactl the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a 
 
final hearing.  You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
UNCONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer 
 
 
and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you 
 
may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify 
 
 
your  spouse  of  the  hearing  by  using  a  Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved 
 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or 
 
denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice

for  Trial,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.924,  after  you  have  complied  with 
 
 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers.  Some circuits may require the completion of 
mediation before a final hearing may be set.  You should contact the  clerk, family law intake  staff, or 
 
 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If your spouse files an 
 
answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to

  Parenting  Plan,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.995(a),  Safety-Focused 
 
 
Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(b), or Relocation/Long-Distance Parenting Plan, Form 12.995(c). If the 
 
 
parents have reached an agreement, a signed and notarized Parenting Plan should be attached. 
If 
 
 
 
the parents have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting Plan may be filed. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
  

 
Updating Information.  A parent or other person seeking to relocate has a continuing duty to provide 
 
current  and  updated  information  required  by  the  relocation  statute  when  that  information  becomes 
 
 
known. 
 
 
 
Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If you and your spouse are unable to agree on parenting arrangements 
 
and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan.  The judge 
will  decide  the  parenting  arrangements  and  time-sharing  based  on  the  child(ren)’s  best  interests. 
  
 
Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to 
 
the minor child(ren). 
 
  
The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. 
 
This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting 
 
 
issues.  The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being 
 
served.  For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes. 
 
 
 
A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment.  You should contact the clerk, 
 
family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses where you live. 
 
 
Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition.  If 
 
 
you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an 
 
attorney before going any further. 
 
 
  Shared Parental Responsibility 
 
 
  Sole Parental Responsibility 
 
 
  Supervised Time-Sharing 
 
  
 
  No contact 
 
 
  Parenting Plan 
 
 
 
  Parenting Plan Recommendation 
 
 
 
  Time-Sharing Schedule 
 
 
 
Child Support.  Both parents  are required to provide financial support  for their minor or dependent 
 
child(ren); however, the court may order one parent to pay  child support  to the other parent.  Florida 
 
has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be  paid.  These  guidelines are 
 
based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both 
 
parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each parent.  You must file a Family Law 
 
Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be 
 
required to do the same.  From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of 
 
child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules 
 
of Procedure Form 12.902(e).  Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, 
 
change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than 
 
that of other people in seemingly similar situations.

Alimony.  Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that one spouse has an actual need for 
 
it and that the other spouse has the ability to pay.  If you want alimony, you must request it in writing in 
 
 
the original petition.  If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you 
 
 
may  not request  it  later).  You may  request  permanent  alimony, bridge-the-gap  alimony,  durational 
 
alimony, and/or rehabilitative alimony. If alimony is awarded, the judge may order periodic payments, 
 
 
 
 
payments in lump sum, or both. 
 
 
 
 
Marital/Nonmarital  Assets  and  Liabilities.  Florida  law  requires  an  equitable  distribution  of  marital 
assets and marital liabilities.  “Equitable” does not necessarily mean “equal.”  Many factors, including 
 
 
child  support,  time-sharing,  and  alimony  awards,  may  lead  the  court  to  make  an  unequal  (but  still 
 
equitable)  distribution of assets and liabilities.  Nonmarital  assets  and nonmarital liabilities  are those 
 
assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility 
 
 
of, only one of the parties.  If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the 
judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
