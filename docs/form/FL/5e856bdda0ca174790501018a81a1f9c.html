FLORIDA FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE 
 
 
FORM 12.985(b)(1) 
 
COLLABORATIVE LAW PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT 
 
PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES (10/20) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

__________________________________ and __________________________, Esquire, {Client’s name} ’s 
 
attorney(s) ___________________, and {Client’s name} ’s _________________________ attorney(s) have 
chosen to use the principles of the Collaborative Law Process to settle the issues related to the dissolution 
 
 
of their marriage. {Client’s name} ___________________ and {Client’s name} ______________________, 
 
hereinafter referred to as the “Clients” or “Client”, have been apprised by their respective attorney(s) of 
possible alternatives and have chosen the Collaborative Law Process to proceed with their divorce. The 
 
Clients  further  understand  that  the  law  and  the  courts  may  confer  certain  rights  and  impose  certain 
 
obligations with respect to property settlement and support but they are not confined by those laws nor 
 
 
to how a judge might rule. The Clients are free to negotiate and resolve issues in the manner that best 
 
suits their own needs and those of their family. This Agreement is being entered into pursuant to, and 
 
consistent with,  Florida Statutes  Sections 61.55-58,  Florida Family  Law  Rules  of Procedure 12.745 and 
 
 
Rules Regulating the Florida Bar 4-1.19. 
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

An  interdisciplinary  collaborative  approach  will  be  utilized  in  this  process  which  integrates  the  legal, 
 
emotional, and financial aspects of the Clients’ divorce. This will be accomplished by using collaborative 
 
professionals, in particular, a Collaborative Facilitator/Mental Health Professional (MHP), a Collaborative 
 
Financial Professional (FP), and two Collaborative attorneys, who comprise the Collaborative Team (the 
“Team”). The MHP and FP will be retained jointly by the Clients, and they will act as neutral professionals 
 
 
in the process. 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Collaborative Team may also choose to jointly engage additional consultants/experts for purposes 
 
of valuation, cash flow analysis, tax issues, retirement programs analysis, child development needs, and 
 
any other issue that the Clients agree requires expert advice and/or recommendations. If, in addition, 
 
either Client desires to consult with an outside expert on his or her own, he or she may do so, but will 
 
 
advise the rest of the Team prior to consulting with the outside expert. 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Collaborative Team and Clients acknowledge that the essence of the Collaborative Law Process is the 
 
shared belief by the participants that it is in the best interests of the Clients and their family to commit 
 
 
themselves to avoiding litigation. We, therefore, adopt this conflict resolution process, which does not 
 
rely on a court-imposed resolution, but relies on an atmosphere of honesty, cooperation, transparency, 
 
 
integrity, and professionalism geared toward the future well-being of the family. The goal is to minimize, 
 
if not eliminate, the negative economic, social, and emotional consequences of litigation to the Clients 
 
and  their  family.  All  parties  commit  ourselves  to  the  Collaborative  Law  Process  and  agree  to  seek  a 
 
resolution outside of litigation. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1. GOALS 
 

 

 

 

 

Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.985(b)(1), Collaborative Law Participation Agreement Principles 
 
and Guidelines (10/20) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. NO COURT OR OTHER INTERVENTION 
 

 

 

 
•  The Clients acknowledge that they have mutually and voluntarily chosen to use the Collaborative 
 
 
Law Process and they understand that their participation in the process is voluntary and either 
 
 
Client may terminate the process at any time, with or without cause. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients commit to resolving this matter without court intervention. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients agree to engage in informal discussions and conferences to negotiate the settlement 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of all issues. 
 
  

 

 
•  The  Clients  agree  to  direct  all  attorneys,  financial  professionals,  mental  health  professionals, 
 
consultants, and other experts retained by the Clients to work in a cooperative effort to resolve 
 
issues without resort to litigation or any other external decision-making process, except as agreed 
 
 
to by the Collaborative Team and the Clients. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  Unless otherwise agreed, no summons or petition will be served or filed, nor will any other 
motion or document be filed that would initiate court intervention prior to the signing of a 
Collaborative Marital Settlement Agreement. 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• 

 

 

 

In the rare event that a petition has been filed prior to the case becoming a Collaborative case, a 
motion for abatement will be filed with the court to obtain a stay of those proceedings while the 
 
 
 
Clients participate in the Collaborative Law Process. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The  Clients  understand  that  if  either  of  them  unilaterally  seeks  court  action  in  a  pending 
 
dissolution of marriage case, the Collaborative Law Process will be automatically terminated. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  When the Clients have reached a final agreement, a Joint Petition for Dissolution of Marriage and 
 
Answer will be filed. One or both of the Clients will appear with counsel at the uncontested final 
 
hearing at which time it will be requested that the court enter a Final Judgment of Dissolution of 
 
 
Marriage ratifying the Clients’ agreement. This is the  only time an appearance in court will be 
 
 
required, if the Clients resolve everything through the Collaborative Law Process. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. INFORMATION GATHERING/DISCOVERY 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The  Clients  agree  to  deal  with  each  other  in  good  faith  and  to  promptly  provide  all  necessary  and 
 
 
reasonable  information  requested.  No  formal  discovery  procedures  will  be  used.  By  using  informal 
 
discovery, the Clients are giving up certain investigative procedures and methods that would be available 
 
in litigation.  The  Clients do this with the  specific understanding  that both of  the  Clients will  make  full 
 
financial  disclosure  of  all  income,  assets,  liabilities,  and  other  information  necessary  for  an  equitable 
 
 
settlement.  If  a  Client  or  a  Collaborative  Professional  requests  that  a  Client  provide  a  document  or 
 
information, the Client from whom the document or information is requested will provide it in a timely 
 
manner, no more than thirty days after the request is made, unless  otherwise agreed to by the other 
 
 
Client or Collaborative Team, including taking reasonable steps to obtain the document or information 
 
from a third party. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Clients agree to give full, honest, and open disclosure of all information, whether requested or not. 
 
The Clients shall provide each other with any written authorizations requested which may be necessary

and Guidelines (10/20) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to obtain information and documentation or to prepare Qualified Domestic Relations Orders or other 
documents. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

The Clients understand that participation in the Collaborative Law Process and the settlement reached 
 
are based upon the assumption that both Clients have acted in good faith and have provided complete 
 
and accurate information to the best of their ability. Each Client will sign a sworn Financial Affidavit making 
 
full and fair disclosure of their income, expenses, assets, and liabilities in accordance with Florida law. The 
Clients have a continuing duty during the Collaborative Law Process to supplement the disclosure made 
 
as their circumstances change or as additional information becomes available, including, but not limited 
to, providing an amended sworn Financial Affidavit. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE COLLABORATIVE LAW PROCESS 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients understand that there is no guarantee that the Collaborative Law Process will result 
 
 
in the Clients resolving all of their differences. 
   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
•  The Clients acknowledge that each of the Collaborative attorneys is independent from the other, 
 
represents only one Client in this Collaborative Law Process, and that neither Client is a third-
party  beneficiary  of  the  other  Client’s  attorney’s  work  for  his  or  her  own  Client.  The  Clients 
acknowledge that each Collaborative attorney is only in privity of contract with, and only owes a 
 
duty to, his or her individual Client and that the Collaborative attorney is not in privity of contract 
 
 
 
with, or owe a duty to, the other Client. 
   
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients understand that the Collaborative Law Process cannot eliminate concerns about the 
 
disharmony, distrust, and irreconcilable differences that have led to the current conflicts between 
 
 
the Clients. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients understand that they are still expected to assert their respective interests and that 
 
 

 
their respective attorneys will help her or him do so. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients understand that while the Collaborative attorneys share a commitment to the process 
described in this document, each of them has a professional duty to represent his or her Client 
 
 
 
diligently, and is not the attorney for the other Client. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. TEMPORARY AGREEMENTS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the event that either Client requires a temporary agreement for any purpose or enters into a partial 
 
 
agreement on any matter, the agreement will be put in writing and signed by the Clients. If either Client 
 
 
withdraws from the Collaborative Law Process, the written agreement may be presented to the court as 
 
a basis for the entry of an order recognizing and enforcing those agreements, which the court shall make 
 
retroactive to the date of the written agreement. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6. PROFESSIONALS’ FEES AND COSTS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Clients agree the Collaborative Professionals are entitled to be paid for their services and their costs, 
 
and the Clients agree to make funds available for this purpose initially and throughout the Collaborative 
 
Law Process. The payment of the professionals’ fees and costs will be an issue to be resolved during one 
or more of our joint meetings, as necessary. The initial determination of how the professionals’ fees and 
 
costs will be paid is not necessarily a determination of the ultimate responsibility to pay the Collaborative 
 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.985(b)(1), Collaborative Law Participation Agreement Principles 
 
 
and Guidelines (10/20) 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Professionals’  fees  and  costs,  which  can  be  negotiated  by  the  parties  as  part  of  a  comprehensive 
 
settlement. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7. PARTICIPATION WITH INTEGRITY 
 
 

 

 
•  The Collaborative Team and the Clients will work to protect the privacy, respect, and dignity of all 
 
including  the  Clients,  attorneys,  other  Collaborative  Professionals  and  any 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
involved, 
 
experts/consultants. 
   

 
•  The Collaborative Team and the Clients will maintain a high standard of integrity and specifically 
 
shall not take advantage of each other or of the miscalculations or inadvertent mistakes of others, 
 
 
 
but shall identify and correct such mistakes. 
  
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The  Collaborative  Team  and  the  Clients  will  respect  each  other,  which  includes  all  of  their 
 

 
 
communications with each other, whether written or verbal. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8. EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS 
 

 

 

 

If consultants or experts are needed, the Clients will retain them jointly unless both of the Clients 
and their attorneys agree otherwise in writing. The payment of the consultants’ or experts’ fees, 
 
 
which will be the responsibility of the Clients, will be resolved so as to ensure that they will be 
 
 
paid throughout the Collaborative Law Process. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the Collaborative Law Process terminates, any new consultants or experts subsequently hired 
 
will  be  permitted  to  review  the  work  product  and  reports  of  prior  consultants  or  experts  to 
 
 
facilitate the transition to litigation, but only if the Clients mutually agree. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9. CHILDREN’S ISSUES 
 

 

 

 
•  The Clients agree to maintain the children’s interests as their highest priority. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

In resolving issues about sharing the enjoyment of and responsibility for the children, the Clients, 
 
 
with the assistance of the Collaborative Professionals, will make every effort to reach amicable 
solutions that promote the children’s best interests. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients agree to act quickly to resolve differences related to the children to promote a caring, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loving, and involved relationship between the children and both the Clients. 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients agree not to seek a custody evaluation while in the Collaborative Law Process. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients agree to isolate the children from involvement in the disputes and not to engage in 
 
 
inappropriate communications regarding the dissolution of the Clients’ marriage or this process 
in the presence of the  children. Nothing will be discussed with the children about this process 
 
 
without the mutual agreement of the Clients. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• 

 
• 

 
• 

 

10. NEGOTIATION IN GOOD FAITH 
 
 

 

 

 
•  The Clients understand that the process, even with full and honest disclosure, will involve vigorous 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
good faith negotiations. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.985(b)(1), Collaborative Law Participation Agreement Principles 
 
and Guidelines (10/20) 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The Clients agree that each of them will negotiate in good faith. Each of them will be expected to 
 
take  a  reasoned  position  in  all  disputes.  Where  such  positions  differ,  each  of  them  will  be 
 
encouraged to use their best efforts to create proposals that meet the Clients’ fundamental needs 
 
and if necessary to compromise to reach a settlement of all issues. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  Although  each  Client  may  discuss  the  likely  outcome  of  litigation,  neither  the  Clients  nor  the 
 
Collaborative Team will use threats of abandoning the Collaborative Law Process or of litigation 
 
as a way of imposing a settlement on one or both of the Clients. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11. ABUSE OF THE COLLABORATIVE LAW PROCESS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We understand that a Collaborative attorney will withdraw from representing his or her Client as soon 
 
as possible upon learning that the Client has withheld or misrepresented information or otherwise 
acted so as to undermine or take unfair advantage of the Collaborative Law Process. Examples of such 
 
violations of the process are: abusing the Clients’ minor children, planning to remove a minor child 
 
 
from the state without the prior written consent of the other Client, or failure to participate in the 
 
 
spirit of the Collaborative Law Process. In addition: 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NEITHER  CLIENT  WILL  DISPOSE  OF  ANY  ASSETS  EXCEPT  AS  AGREED  TO  IN  WRITING  BY  BOTH 
 
CLIENTS. NEITHER CLIENT WILL FAIL TO DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF ANY ASSETS OR LIABILITIES 
 
 
TO THE OTHER CLIENT. ALL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE MAINTAINED 
 
AND CONTINUED. NEITHER CLIENT SHALL BORROW AGAINST, CANCEL, TRANSFER, DISPOSE OF 
OR CHANGE BENEFICIARIES OF ANY INSURANCE OR OTHER COVERAGE INCLUDING LIFE, HEALTH, 
 
 
AUTOMOBILE,  AND  DISABILITY,  HELD  FOR  THE  BENEFIT  OF  THE  CLIENTS  OR  THEIR  MINOR 
 
 
CHILDREN, WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION OF THE OTHER CLIENT. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NEITHER CLIENT WILL, WITHOUT THE WRITTEN PERMISSION OF THE OTHER CLIENT, INCUR ANY 
 
 
DEBTS OR LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE OTHER CLIENT MAY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12. DISQUALIFICATION BY COURT INTERVENTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

The Clients understand that each attorney’s representation of his or her Client with respect to the subject 
 
of this matter is limited to the Collaborative Law Process and other non-adversarial dispute resolution 
 
methods, and that neither of the attorneys can ever represent his or her Client in litigation against the 
other Client related to the issues in this matter other than for an uncontested hearing. Once the Clients 
settle all of their issues related to this matter, the attorneys will prepare all required papers to be filed 
with  the  court  to  obtain  an  uncontested  final  judgment.  Each  of  the  Collaborative  attorneys  and  any 
 
attorney “in association” with that attorney is forever disqualified from appearing as attorney of record 
 
for any party to litigation or in any other contested family law matter in litigation involving the Clients and 
 
the  subject  matter  of  this  Process,  such  as  a  proceeding  or  action  for  dissolution  of  marriage  or  for 
 
modification or enforcement of judgment or order, writs and/or appeals. An attorney will be deemed “in 
 
 
association”  with  a  Collaborative  attorney  if,  at  any  time  during  the  pendency  of  a  proceeding  for 
 
dissolution of marriage or future family law proceedings between the Clients that is related to the subject 
 
matter of this Collaborative matter, such attorney is the employer or employee of, co-employee with, or 
 
partner  in  the  firm  or  shares  a  relationship  of  independent  contractor  status  with  either  of  the 
 
Collaborative attorneys.

In the event that the Collaborative Law Process terminates, the Clients agree that, except upon mutual 
 
written agreement of the Clients to the contrary, all consultants or experts retained by either Client or 
 
attorney, or whose work product is used by either Client or attorney during the term of this Agreement, 
 
will  be  disqualified  as  an  expert  witness  for  either  Client  to  testify  as  to  any  matter  related  to  the 
 
consultant’s or expert’s work product in the Collaborative Law Process. However, if the Collaborative Law 
Process  is  terminated  and  the  Clients  participate  in  subsequent  litigation  of  the  matters  that  are  the 
 
 
subject of this process, the Clients can mutually agree in writing to use the work product of the MHP, FP, 
 
a consultant, or an expert in the contested litigation with the consent of the MHP, FP, consultant, or an 
 
 
expert. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13. STATEMENTS OF CLIENTS AND ATTORNEYS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
•  All  communications,  whether  verbal,  written,  or  otherwise,  among  the  Clients  and  any  of  the 
 
Collaborative Professionals in the Collaborative Law Process are deemed settlement discussions 
 
and will be confidential and privileged under Florida law, and may not be offered as evidence in 
 
any subsequent proceedings, except as provided by Florida law. Nonetheless, statements by any 
 
Client that indicate an intent or disposition to endanger the health or safety of either Client, child 
 
abuse or neglect, elder abuse, the commission of a crime or fraud or as part of a plan to commit 
 
a crime or a fraud, or to create a public hazard, will not be privileged or deemed confidential and, 
 
in fact, must be disclosed to appropriate authorities under Florida law. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  All  documents  expressly  identified  and  entitled  “For  Settlement  Purposes  Only”  in  the 
 
Collaborative Law Process shall be inadmissible and not a waiver of privilege, for any purpose in 
 
any  subsequent  proceeding  except  as  otherwise  mutually  agreed  to  by  the  Clients  and 
 
Collaborative Professionals, and no such communications will be deemed to be a waiver of any 
 
privilege or confidentiality of any Client. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  The  Clients  understand  that  some  of  the  communications  between  the  Collaborative 
professionals  will  be  intended  to  facilitate  the  negotiation  between  the  Clients  of  a  mutually 
 
acceptable settlement and may not be shared with the Clients. Each Collaborative attorney will 
 
provide information to the Client as the attorney deems appropriate under the circumstances, 
 
always mindful of the attorney’s ethical obligation that the Client receives sufficient information 
 
to provide informed consent to any agreements to be entered into through the Collaborative Law 
 
Process. 
  

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14. TERMINATION OF COLLABORATIVE LAW PROCESS 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• 

 

 

 

If the Collaborative Team is unable to resolve any matters within this process, the Clients agree 
that a mediator will be retained by  the Clients, chosen by  the attorneys and the Clients, in an 
 
 
attempt to help the Clients resolve the dispute prior to the Clients taking any action before a court 
 
of competent jurisdiction, except in emergency situations. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  After  mediation,  if  the  case  is  still  not  resolved,  either  Client  may  unilaterally  terminate  the 
Collaborative Law Process by giving written notice to the other Client and his or her attorney of 
the decision to terminate the process. Either attorney may withdraw from this matter unilaterally 
 
by giving 10 days written notice of such election to the other Client and his or her attorney. This 
 
election does not terminate the Collaborative Law Process if the Client whose attorney withdraws

retains a new attorney who agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement and the other Client 
 
 
and  the  Collaborative  professionals  consent  to  the  new  attorney  participating  in  this  process 
 
within thirty (30) days of the notices of withdrawal being sent by the attorney who withdrew. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
•  Upon termination of the Collaborative Law Process, there will be a 30-day waiting period (unless 
there  is  an  emergency)  before  any  court  hearing,  to  permit  both  Clients  to  retain  litigation 
 
attorneys and to make an orderly transition to litigation, as it is mandatory that both Collaborative 
attorneys withdraw from representing his or her Client upon the termination of the Collaborative 
 
Law Process. The intent of this provision is to avoid surprise and prejudice to the rights of the 
 
other  Client.  It  is  therefore  mutually  agreed  that  either  Client  may  bring  this provision  to  the 
attention of a court in requesting a postponement of a hearing scheduled within thirty (30) days 
 
of the termination of the Collaborative Law Process. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

WE HEREBY PLEDGE TO COMPLY WITH AND TO PROMOTE THE SPIRIT AND WRITTEN WORD OF THIS 
 
AGREEMENT.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
