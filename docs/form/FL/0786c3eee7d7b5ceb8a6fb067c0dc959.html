      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW
 
 
FORM 12.905(b)
 
  
SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT
 
  
(11/15)
 
 
 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 
This form should be used when you are asking the court to change a current court-ordered child support 
obligation.  The court can change a child support order or judgment if the judge finds that there has been 
 
 
a  substantial  change  in  the  circumstances  of  the  parties  and  the  change  is  in  the  child(ren)’s  best 
 
interests. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file this form in the county where the original order 
was entered.  If the order was entered in another state, or if the child(ren) live(s) in another state, you 
 
should speak with an attorney about where to file this form.  You should file the original with the clerk of 
the circuit court and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the supplemental 
petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service.  If you absolutely do not 
 
know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service.  You may also be able to use constructive 
service if the other party resides in another state or country.  However, if constructive service is used, 
other than granting a divorce, the court may only grant limited relief.  For more information on 
 
constructive service, see Notice of Action for Family Cases with Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a)(2), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, Florida 
 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b).  If the other party is in the military service of the United 
 
States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for example, Memorandum for Certificate of 
Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a).  In sum, the law regarding 
 
constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you may 
wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues. 
 
 
If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your 
 
supplemental petition.  Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.905(b), Supplemental Petition for 
 
Modification of Child Support (11/15) 

     

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

DEFAULT...  If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed all 
 
of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final 
 
hearing.  You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
UNCONTESTED...  If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your supplemental 
petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the 
required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  
You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED...  If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees 
with or denies anything in your supplemental petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, 
you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you 
 
have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require 
the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family 
 
 
law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If 
 
the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 
 
days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in “bold underline” in these instructions are defined 
there.  For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes. 
 

  

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.905(b), Supplemental Petition for 
 
Modification of Child Support (11/15) 

 

 

 
 

CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Special notes... 
 

 
If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of 
 
Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to 
 
have filing fees deferred. 
 
 
With this form, you must also file the following: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
  Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 

 

 

12.902(e).  (If you do not know the other party’s income, you may file this worksheet 
after his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.) 
 

 

 
	  Settlement Agreement, if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.  

 

 

 

Although there is no form for this in these Florida Family Law Forms, you may construct 
a settlement agreement using the pertinent sections contained in Marital Settlement 
Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	  Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 

 
	 

 

 

12.902(j), if not previously filed. 
 
Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or 
 
(c).  Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.932.  (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the 
supplemental petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the supplemental 
petition, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.) 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
Child Support...  The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in 
meeting the child(ren)’s material needs.  Both parents are required to provide financial support, but 
one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other parent. 
 
Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid.  These guidelines 
are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of 
both parents.  You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
 
Form 12.902(b) or (c), and the other parent will be required to do the same.  From your financial 
 
affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the 
Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e).  Because 
 
the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from 
 
 
state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly 
similar situations. 
 
 
Temporary Relief...  If you need temporary relief regarding child support, you may file a Motion for 
 
Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a).  For more information, see the instructions for that form. 
 
Settlement Agreement...  If you and the respondent are able to reach an agreement on any or all of the 
issues, you should file a Settlement Agreement.  Although there is no form for this in these Florida 
 
Family Law Forms, you may construct a settlement agreement using the pertinent sections contained in 
  

  
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.905(b), Supplemental Petition for 
 
Modification of Child Support (11/15) 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
  

Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1).  Both parties must sign this agreement 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered 
contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing. 
 
 
Final Judgment Form...  These family law forms contain a Supplemental Final Judgment Modifying 
 
Child Support, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.993(b), which the judge may use. 
  
You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring it 
with you to the hearing.  If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case 
number, division, and the parties’ names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your 
hearing or trial. 
 
 
Nonlawyer...  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps 
you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida 
 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill 
 
out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the 
 
last page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
