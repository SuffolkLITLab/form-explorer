      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
FORM 12.901(b)(1), 
PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE WITH DEPENDENT OR 
MINOR CHILD(REN)  
 (02/18) 

When should this form be used? 

This form should be used when you are filing for a dissolution of marriage, and you and your spouse 
have a dependent or minor child(ren) together, or a spouse  is pregnant.  You or your spouse must have 
lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a dissolution in Florida.  You must file this form if the 
following is true: 



You and your spouse have a dependent or minor child(ren) together or a spouse  is pregnant.

This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.  Because you are filing the  petition in this 
proceeding, you may also be referred to as the petitioner and your spouse as the respondent. 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 

The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 

What should I do next? 

For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition.  If you know where your 
spouse lives, you should use personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where your spouse lives, 
you may use constructive service.  You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides 
in another state or country; however, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the 
court may only grant limited relief, which cannot include either spousal support (alimony) or child support. 
For  more  information  on  constructive  service,  see  Notice  of  Action  for  Family  Cases  with  Minor 
Child(ren),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.913(a)(2),  and  Affidavit  of  Diligent 
Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(c).  If your spouse is in the military 
service  of  the  United  States,  additional  steps  for  service  may  be  required.    See,  for  example, 
Memorandum  for  Certificate  of  Military  Service,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form 
12.912(a) and Affidavit of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(b). 
In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very 
complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues. 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.901(b)(1), Petition for Dissolution of 
Marriage  with Dependent  or Minor Child(ren)  (02/18) 

If personal service is used, your spouse has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition.  Your 
case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 

EFAULT. If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed all 
of the required papers, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a 
final hearing.  You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

NCONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer 
and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you 
may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify 
your  spouse  of  the  hearing  by  using  a  Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

ONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or 
denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice 
for  Trial,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.924,  after  you  have  complied  with 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers.  Some circuits may require the completion of 
mediation  before a final hearing may be set.  You should contact the  clerk, family law intake  staff, or 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If your spouse files an 
answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to 
Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 

Where can I look for more information? 

efore proceeding, you should read  General Information for Self-Represented Litigants  found at the 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there.  
For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes. 

 

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 

fter  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
A-Z Topical Index. 

ELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made.

will  decide  the  parenting  arrangements  and  time-sharing  based  on  the  child(ren)’s  best  interests.  
Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves jurisdiction to modify issues relating to 
the minor child(ren). 

he judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case.  
This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting 
issues.  The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being 
served.  For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes. 

 parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment.  You should contact the clerk, 

family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses where you live. 

isted below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your petition.  If 
you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should speak with an 
attorney before going any further. 
 

  Shared Parental Responsibility 
  Sole Parental Responsibility 
  Supervised Time-Sharing  
  No contact 
  Parenting Plan 
  Parenting Plan Recommendation 
  Time-Sharing Schedule 

hild Support.   Both parents are required to provide financial support for their minor  or dependent 
child(ren); however, the court may order one parent to pay child support to  the other parent.    Florida 
has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be  paid.  These guidelines are 
based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of both 
parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each parent.  You must file a Family Law 
Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be 
required to do the same.  From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of 
child support that should be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules 
of Procedure Form 12.902(e).  Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, 
change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than 
that of other people in seemingly similar situations. 

limony.  Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that one spouse has an actual need for 
it and also finds that the other spouse has the ability to pay.  If you want alimony, you must request it in 
writing in the original petition.  If you do not request alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is 
waived (you may not request it later).  You may request permanent alimony, bridge-the-gap alimony, 
durational alimony, , and/or rehabilitative alimony. If alimony is awarded, the judge may order periodic 
payments, payments in lump sum, or both. 

arital/Nonmarital  Assets  and  Liabilities.    Florida  law  requires  an  equitable  distribution  of  marital 
assets and marital liabilities.  “Equitable” does not necessarily mean “equal.”  Many factors, including 
child  support,  time-sharing,  and  alimony  awards,  may  lead  the  court  to  make  an  unequal  (but  still 
equitable)  distribution of assets and liabilities.   Nonmarital assets  and nonmarital liabilities  are those

assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the responsibility 
of, only one of the parties.  If the parties agree or the court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the 
judge will not consider it when distributing marital assets and liabilities. 

emporary  Relief.    If  you  need  temporary  relief  regarding  temporary  use  of  assets,  temporary 
responsibility  for  liabilities,  parental  responsibility  and  time-sharing  with  child(ren),  temporary  child 
support, or temporary alimony, you may file a  Motion for Temporary Support and Time-Sharing with 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren),  Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(a).  For more 
information, see the instructions for that form. 

arital Settlement Agreement.   If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of 
the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent 
or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1).  Both of you must 
sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk.  Any issues on which you are unable to agree 
will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing. 

arenting Plan.   In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved 
or established by the court. If you and your spouse have reached an agreement, you should file one of the 
following: Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), Safety-Focused 
Parenting  Plan,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.995(b),  or  Relocation/Long-
Distance Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(c), which addresses 
the time-sharing schedule for the child(ren).  If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting 
Plan may be filed.  If the parties are unable to agree, a Parenting Plan will be established by the court. 

inal Judgment Form.   These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(c)(1), which 
the judge may use if your case is contested. If you and your spouse reach an agreement on all of the issues, 
the  judge  may  use  a  Final  Judgment  of  Dissolution of  Marriage with  Dependent  or  Minor Child(ren) 
(Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.990(b)(1).  You should check with 
the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring a final judgment with you 
to the hearing.  If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, 
division, and the parties’ names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or 
trial. 

onlawyer.   Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you 
fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law 
Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these 
forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of 
every form he or she helps you complete.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
