      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 

 
FORM 12.923, 

 
 
NOTICE OF HEARING (GENERAL) (11/15) 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Anytime you have set a hearing before a judge, you must send notice of the hearing to the otherparty. 
 
 
IMPORTANT: If your hearing has been set before a general magistrate, you should use Notice of Hearing 
 
Before General Magistrate, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.920(c). If your hearing has 
 
been set before  a child support  enforcement  hearing officer, you should use  Notice of Hearing (Child 
 
Support Hearing Officer), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.921. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should file the original 
 
 
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where your case was filed and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 
 
A  copy  of  this  form  must  be  mailed,  e-mailed,  or  hand  delivered  to  the  other party  in  your  case.  If  a 
default has been entered, you must still send this form to the other party to notify the other party of the 
 
final hearing. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration.  If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
 
 
pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida 
 
 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the 
 
 
Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court 
 
in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents  by  e-mail, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions  for  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  Notice  of  Hearing 
 
(General) (11/15) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration2.516. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms. For further information on serving notices of hearing, see rule 1.090(d), Florida 
 
 
 
Civil Rules of Procedure. 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Special notes... 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
To set a hearing date and time, you will usually have to make a good-faith effort to coordinate a mutually 
 
 
convenient date and time for you, the other parties in the case, and the judge, except in certain emergency 
 
situations. Some circuits may have additional procedural requirements that you must follow when you 
 
 
notify the court and other parties of your scheduled hearing. Therefore, before you complete this form, 
you should contact the clerk’s office, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for information regarding 
 
 
the proper procedure to follow. 
 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms,  that  person  must  give  you  a  copy  of  Disclosure  from  Nonlawyer,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
 
he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
