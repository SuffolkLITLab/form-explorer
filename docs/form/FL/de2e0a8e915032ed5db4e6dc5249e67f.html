Form W-9 (Rev. 12-2014) 

Form W-9 (Rev.  12-2014) 

Page2 

Note. If you are a U.S.  person and a requester gives you a form  other than Form 
W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form If it is substantially 
similar to this Form W-9. 
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. 
person if you are: 

•  An individual who is a U.S. citizen  or U.S.  resident alien; 

•  A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the 
United States or under the laws of the United States; 

•  An estate (other than a foreign estate); or 

•  A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301. 7701-7). 
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in 
the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 
1446 on any foreign partners' share of effectively connected taxable Income from 
such business. Further, In certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, 
the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a 
foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a 
U.S.  person that is a partner in  a partnership conducting a trade or business In the 
United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status 
and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income. 

In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership 

for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its 
allocable share of net Income from the partnership conducting a trade or business 
in the United States: 

•  In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the 
disregarded entity and not the entity; 

•  In the case of a granter trust with a U.S. granter or other U.S.  owner, generally, 
the U.S. granter or other U.S. owner of the granter trust and not the trust; and 

•  In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a granter trust), the U.S. trust (other than a 
granter trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust. 
Foreign person. If you are a foreign  person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank 
that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use 
the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see  Publication 515, Withholding of Tax 
on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entitles). 
Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident 
alien Individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on 
certain types of Income. However,  most tax treaties contain a provision known as 
a "saving clause." Exceptions specified In the saving clause may permit an 
exemption from tax to continue for certain types of Income even after the payee 
has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien tor tax purposes. 

If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying  on an  exception contained In the 
saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from  U.S. tax on certain types 
of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following 
five Items: 

1. The treaty country.  Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you 

claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien. 

2. The treaty article addressing the Income. 

3. The article number (or location) In the tax treaty that contains the saving 

clause and its exceptions. 

4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax. 
5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty 

article. 

Example.  Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption 
from tax for scholarship Income received by a Chinese student temporarily present 
in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will  become a resident alien for 
tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. 
However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 
1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the 
Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student 
who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocoO and Is 
relying on this exception to claim an  exemption from tax on  his or her scholarship 
or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the 
information described above to support that exemption. 

If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the 

appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233. 

Backup Withholding 
What is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you  must 
under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 28% of such payments. This 
is called "backup withholding."  Payments that may be subject to backup 
withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter 
exchange transactions, rents, royalties,  nonemployee pay, payments made in 
settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain 
payments from fishing boat operators.  Real estate transactions are not subject to 
backup withholding. 

You will not be subject to backup withholding on  payments you  receive if you 
give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all 
your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return. 
Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if: 

1. You  do not furnish your TIN to the requester, 

2. You  do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II  instructions on page 

3 for details), 

3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an  Incorrect TIN, 

4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did 
not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest 
and dividends only), or 

5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup 

withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened 
after 1983 only). 

Certain payees and payments are exempt from  backup withholding. See Exempt 

payee code on page 3 and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form 
w-g for more information. 

Also. see Spec/al rules for partnerships above. 

What is FATCA reporting? 
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign 
financial institution to report all  United states account holders that are specified 
United States persons.  Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See 
Exemption from FA TCA reporting code on page 3 and the Instructions for the 
Requester of Form W-9 for more information. 

Updating Your Information 
You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be 
an  exempt payee if you are no longer an  exempt payee and anticipate receiving 
reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to 
provide updated Information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S 
corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new 
Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example,  if the granter 
of a granter trust dies. 

Penalties 
Failure to furnish TIN. If you fall to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are 
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to 
reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. 
Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a 
false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, 
you are subject to a $500 penaity. 
Criminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully faisifying certifications or 
affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or 
Imprisonment. 

Misuse of TINs.  If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal  law, 
the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penaities.

have an  ITIN, see How to get a TIN below. 

If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you  may enter either your SSN 

or EIN.  However, the IRS prefers that you use your SSN. 

If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an  entity separate from its 

owner (see Umited Liability Company (LLC)  on this page},  enter the owner's SSN 
(or EIN, if the owner has one).  Do not enter the disregarded entity's EIN. lf the LLC 
Is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entity's EIN. 
Note. See the chart on  page 4 for further clarification of name and TIN 
combinations. 

How to get a TIN. If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately, To apply 
for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from your local 
SSA office or get ttiis form online at www.ssa.gov.  You may also get this form by 
calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Number, to apply for an !TIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer 
Identification Number, to apply for an EIN, You can apply for an EIN  online by 
accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/bus/nesses and clicking on Employer 
Identification Number (EIN} under Starting a Business. You can get Forms W-7 and 
SS-4 from the IRS by visiting IRS.gov or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM 
(1-800-829-3676), 

If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN 
and write "Applied For" in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it 
to the requester.  For interest and dividend payments, and certain  payments made 
with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get 
a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on 
payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be 
subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to 
the requester. 
Note. Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or that 
you intend to apply for one soon. 
Caution: A  disregarded U.S.  entity that has a foreign owner must use the 
appropriate Form W-8.

Secure Your Tax Records from Identity Theft 
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your 
name, SSN, or other Identifying Information, without your permission, to commit 
fraud or other crimes. An Identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a 
tax return  using your SSN to receive a refund. 

To reduce your risk: 

•  Protect your SSN, 

•  Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN,  and 

•  Be careful when choosing a tax preparer. 

If your tax records are affected by Identity theft and you receive a notice from 
the IRS,  respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS 
notice or letter. 

If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you 
are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity 
or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit 
Form 14039, 

For more information, see Publication 4535, Identity Theft Prevention and Victim 

Assistance. 

Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a system 

problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved 
through normal channels,  may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (rAS) 
assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case Intake line at 
1-877-777-4778 orTTY/fDD 1-800-829-4059. 

Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes.  Phishing is the 
creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business 
emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely 
claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in  an  attempt to scam the user 
into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft. 

The IRS does not Initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does 

not request personal detailed Information through email or ask taxpayers for the 
PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access Information for their credit card, 
bank, or other financial accounts. 

If you receive an  unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this 
message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, 
or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration 
(rlGTA) at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal 
Trade Commission at: spam@uce.gov or contact them at www.ftc.gov/ldtheft or 
1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).
