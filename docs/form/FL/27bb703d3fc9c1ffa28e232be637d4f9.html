INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED 
  
 
FAMILY LAW FORM 12.975(b) 
 
PETITION FOR GRANDPARENT VISITATION WITH MINOR CHILD(REN) 
 
WHEN ONE PARENT HAS BEEN FOUND CRIMINALLY OR CIVILLY LIABLE 
 
FOR THE DEATH OF THE OTHER PARENT 
 
(03/23) 
 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

This form should be used when a grandparent or stepgrandparent is filing for visitation rights as provided 
 
in Section 752.011(2), Florida Statutes. You may file for visitation under this law if you are the grandparent 
 
or stepgrandparent of a child(ren) whose parent died and the other parent was held criminally liable for 
the death of the other parent of the child(ren) or civilly liable for an intentional tort causing the death of 
the other parent of the child. 
  
 
This petition should be typed or printed in black ink. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

After completing this form, you should file this form with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where 
 
 
 
you live and keep a copy for your records. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

You  must  file  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.902(d),  Uniform  Child  Custody 
 
Jurisdiction and Enforcement Affidavit. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You must pay the appropriate filing fees to the clerk of the circuit court. If you cannot afford to pay the 
 
 
filing fees, you may fill out an Application for Determination of Civil Indigent Status, and file it with your 
 
petition for Grandparent Visitation with Minor Child(ren) when One Parent has Been Found Criminally or 
 
Civilly Liable for the Death of the Other Parent. You may obtain this form from the clerk and he or she will 
 
determine whether you are eligible to have filing fees waived. 
  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Either you or the clerk of court will need to complete a Family Court Cover Sheet, Florida Family Law Rules 
 
of Procedure Form 12.928. The clerk’s office can provide this form. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the parent of the minor child(ren) that is not deceased 
 
with this petition. You must file a certified copy of the death certificate of the parent who died. 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If you know where the non-deceased parent lives, you should use personal service. 
  

 

 

 

If you absolutely do not know where the non-deceased parent lives, you may also use constructive service. 
 
You may also be able to use constructive service if the non-deceased parent resides in another state or 
 
 
country. For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Family Cases with Minor 
 
Child(ren),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.913(a)(2),  and  Affidavit  of  Diligent 
 
 
Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b). 
  

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.975(b), Petition for Grandparent Visitation 
 
with Minor Child(ren) when One Parent has Been Found Criminally or Civilly Liable for the Death of the Other 
 
Parent (03/23) 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The parent will have 20 days to answer your petition after being served with your petition. Your case will 
 
then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
DEFAULT. If after 20 days, none of the parties have filed an answer or any other document, you 
 
may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with 
 
the clerk of court. Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, depending on your jurisdiction, 
 
you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or the judicial assistant to set a final hearing. You 
 
must  notify  the  parents  of  the  hearing  by  using  a  Notice  of  Final  Hearing  (General),  Florida 
  
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
UNCONTESTED.  If  all  parties  file  an  answer  that  agrees  with  everything  in  your  petition, 
 
depending on your jurisdiction, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant 
 
 
to schedule a final hearing. You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of 
 
Final  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
  
 
appropriate notice of hearing form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
CONTESTED. If any of the parties file an answer, which disagrees with or denies anything in your 
 
petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Some  circuits  may  require  the  completion  of  mediation  before  a  final  hearing  may  be  scheduled. 
Depending on your jurisdiction, you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant 
 
for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing) and to inquire if mediation is required 
  
before a final hearing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
You must obtain a date and time for any court appearance, including the final hearing, from the clerk of 
 
court, family law intake staff or judicial assistant. On that date of the hearing, all petitioners must appear 
before a judge. If required by your jurisdiction, you should bring an Order On Grandparent’s Petition for 
 
 
Visitation with Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.975(c), with you 
 
to the hearing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If you fail to complete this procedure, the court may dismiss the case. 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
beginning of these forms. The words that are in “bold underline” in these instructions are defined there. 
 
For further information, see chapter 752, Florida Statutes, and Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Rule 
 
12.105. 
  

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration require that all petitions, pleadings, and 
 
documents  be  filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file 
 
petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If 
 
you choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with 
 
Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of 
  
the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MUST SERVE DOCUMENTS BY E-MAIL UNLESS EXCUSED PURSUANT TO 
FLORIDA  RULE  OF  GENERAL  PRACTICE  AND  JUDICIAL  ADMINISTRATION  2.516(b)(1)(D).  If  a  self-
 
 
represented litigant has been excused from serving documents by e-mail and then elects to serve and 
 
receive documents by e-mail, the procedures must always be followed once that election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the
