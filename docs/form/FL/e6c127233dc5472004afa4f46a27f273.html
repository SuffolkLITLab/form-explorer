INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.981(a)(3), 
 
AFFIDAVIT OF NONPATERNITY (03/15) 
 

 

 
 
When should this form be used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
This form should be used when a stepfather is adopting his wife’s minor child and the mother and father of 
 
the minor child(ren) were never married and paternity has not been established by a valid acknowledgment 
 
or court order. This Affidavit of Nonpaternity may be used instead of a consent form. This Affidavit may be 
executed before the birth of the minor child. The person signing the affidavit waives notice to all court 
 
proceedings after the date it is signed. After signing this affidavit, it may only be withdrawn if the court finds 
 
the affidavit was obtained by fraud or duress. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. This form must be signed before a notary public or deputy 
 
 
clerk and two witnesses other than the notary or clerk. You should then file the original of this form with the 
 
Joint Petition for Stepparent Adoption, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.981(b)(1). 
 

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that petitions, pleadings, and documents be filed 
electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or  other 
 
pleadings electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or 
 
other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 
 
2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. The rules and procedures 
 
 
should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Special Notes 
 

 

 

 

 

Remember--a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms,  that person  must give you  a  copy  of  a  Disclosure  from  Nonlawyer,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he 
 
or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
