      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY 

LAW FORM 12.905(a),
 
  
SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION TO MODIFY PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY,
 
 
VISITATION OR PARENTING PLAN/ TIME–SHARING SCHEDULE AND
 
 
OTHER RELIEF
 
  
(11/15)
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 
This form should be used when you are asking the court to change the current parental 
responsibility, visitation, and/or Parenting Plan/time-sharing schedule. A determination of parental 
 
 
responsibility, a Parenting Plan and a time-sharing schedule may not be modified without a showing 
 
of a substantial, material, and unanticipated change in circumstances and a determination that the 
modification is in the best interests of the child(ren). 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the 
 
form before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file this form in the county where the 
 
original order or judgment was entered.  If the order or judgment was entered in another state, or if 
the child(ren) live(s) in another state, you should speak with an attorney about where to file this 
form.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court and keep a copy for your 
 
records. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

       

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents 
 
be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida 
 
Rule of  Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the  judicial circuit in 
 
 
which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the supplemental 
 
 
 
petition. If you know where he or she lives, you should use personal service.  If you absolutely do 
not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service.  You may also be able to use 
constructive service if the other party resides in another state or country.  However, if constructive 
 
service is used, other than granting a dissolution of marriage, the court may only grant limited relief.  
 
For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action for Family Cases with Minor 
Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a),(2) and Affidavit of Diligent 
Search and Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b).  If the other party is in

the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for 
 
example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
 
Law Form 12.912(a).  In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in 
 
the military service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues. 
 
 
If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your 
 
supplemental petition.  Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 
DEFAULT...  If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed 
 
 
all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set 
 
a final hearing.  You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing 
 
(General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of 
hearing form. 
 
UNCONTESTED...  If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your 
 
supplemental petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure 
 
and filed all of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial 
assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of 
Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate 
 
notice of hearing form. 
 
CONTESTED...  If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees 
 
with or denies anything in your supplemental petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed 
issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, 
 
after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some 
 
 
circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should 
contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case 
 
for trial (final hearing).  If the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer 
 
the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at 
 
the beginning of these forms.  The words that are in “bold underline” in these instructions are 
 
defined there. For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes

Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing... 
arrangements and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a 
Parenting Plan.  The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and time-sharing schedule based 
 
on the child(ren)’s best interests.  Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves 
 
jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren). 

 
If you and the respondent are unable to agree on parenting 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your 
case.  This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning 
 
 
parenting issues.  The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the 
child(ren) is (are) being served.  For more information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida 
 
Statutes. 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A parenting course may be required prior to entry of a final judgment.  You should contact the clerk, 
 
family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses or mediation 
 
where you live. 
 
Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your 
supplemental petition.  If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, 
 
you should speak with an attorney before going any further. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 
 
  Shared Parental Responsibility 
 
 
  Sole Parental Responsibility 
 
 
  Supervised Time-Sharing

Child Support…  The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent in 
meeting the child(ren)’s material needs.  Both parents are required to provide financial support, 
but one parent may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the other 
parent.  Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid.  
These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the 
financial contributions of both parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each 
 
parent.  You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
12.902(b) or (c), and the other parent will be required to do the same.  From your financial 
 
affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the 
Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). 
  
Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and 
 
vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people

If you need temporary relief regarding parental responsibility and time-sharing 

Temporary Relief… 
 
with child(ren), or temporary child support, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support and 
Time-Sharing with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
 
Form 12.947(a).  For more information, see the instructions for that form. 
 
 
If you and the respondent are able to reach an agreement on any or all 
Settlement Agreement… 
of the issues, you should file a Settlement Agreement.  Although there is no form for this in these 
Florida Family Law Forms, you may construct a settlement agreement using the pertinent sections 
 
contained in Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor 
 
Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1).  Both parties must sign 
this agreement before a notary public. Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be 
considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing. 
 
 
Final Judgment Form…  These family law forms contain a Supplemental Final Judgment Modifying 
  
Parental Responsibility, Visitation, or Parenting Plan/Time-Sharing Schedule And Other Relief, 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.993(a), which the judge may use.  You should 
 
 
check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring it with 
you to the hearing.  If so, you should type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case 
number, division, and the parties’ names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your 
hearing or trial. 
 
 
Nonlawyer…  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer 
 
helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer 
 
helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on 
 
 
the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
