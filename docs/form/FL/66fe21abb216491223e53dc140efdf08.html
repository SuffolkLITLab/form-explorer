FAMILY LAW FORM 12.970(a) 
 
PETITION FOR TEMPORARY CUSTODY BY EXTENDED FAMILY 
(06/21) 
 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

This  form  should  be  used  by  an  extended  family  member  to  obtain  temporary  custody  of  a  child  or 
 
children  pursuant  to  Chapter  751,  Florida  Statutes.  This  form  should  not  be  used  if  you  are  a  parent 
 
seeking to establish parental responsibility or time-sharing with a child or children. 
 
 
An Extended Family Member is: 
 
A relative of a minor child within the third degree by blood or marriage to the parent; 
 
OR 
 
The stepparent of a minor child if the stepparent is currently married to the parent of the child and is not 
 
a  party  in  a  pending  dissolution,  separate  maintenance,  domestic  violence,  or  other  civil  or  criminal 
 
proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction involving one or both of the children’s parents as an 
 
 
 
 
adverse party; 
 
OR 
 
An individual who qualifies as “fictive kin.” As defined in section 39.01, Florida Statutes, fictive kin means a 
 
 
 
person unrelated by birth, marriage, or adoption who has an emotionally significant relationship, which 
 
possesses the characteristics of a family relationship, to a child. 
 
 
You may file a Petition for Temporary Custody if: 
 
You have the signed, notarized consents of the children’s legal parents; 
 
 
OR 
 
You are an extended family member who is caring full time for the children in the role of a substitute 
 
 
 
 
parent and with whom the children are presently living. 
 
 
If one of the minor children’s parents objects to the Petition, the court shall grant the Petition only upon 
 
 
 
 
a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the children’s parent or parents are unfit to provide for 
 
 
the care and control of the children. In determining that a parent is unfit, the court must find that the 
 
 
parent has abused, abandoned, or neglected the children, as defined in Chapter 39, Florida Statutes.  If 
 
you do not have the parents’ consents, you should consult a family  law  attorney  before  you  file  your 
 
 
 
 
papers. 
 
 
If you do not meet the qualifications above, you should talk to an attorney about other options. You may 
 
also report any suspected abuse, abandonment, or neglect to the appropriate authorities. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
 
 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.

The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, 
 
and documents be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file 
 
petitions or other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you 
 
choose to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida 
 
Rule of GeneralPractice and Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process  server,  the  Florida  Rules  of  General  Practice  and  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all 
 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-
mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth 
 
in  the  Rules  of  General  Practice  and  Judicial  Administration.  If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic 
 
service,  which means  serving  or receiving pleadings by  electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida 
 
Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 
You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of General Practice and Judicial 
 
Administration  provided  under  either Family  Law  Forms:  Getting  Started,  or Rules  of  Court  in the  A-Z 
Topical Index. 
 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please

Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration

IF  YOU  HAVE  SIGNED  AND  NOTARIZED  WAIVERS  OF  SERVICE  OF  PROCESS  AND  CONSENTS  from  the 
 
child(ren)’s parents, and the case is uncontested, you may contact the clerk, family law intake  staff,  or 
 
judicial assistant, to set a final hearing. You must notify the child(ren)’s parents of the hearing by using a 
   
Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other 
 
appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
If one of the parents is deceased, you must file a certified copy of the proof of death. 
 
 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SIGNED AND NOTARIZED WAIVERS OF SERVICE OF PROCESS AND CONSENTS from 
 
the children’s parents, you must properly notify the parents of the petition. If you know where he or she 
 
lives,  you  should  use  personal  service.  If  you  absolutely  do  not  know  where  he  or  she  lives  after 
 
conducting a diligent search, you may use constructive service. You must complete all of the searches 
listed  in  the  Affidavit  of  Diligent  Search  and  Inquiry,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules  of  Procedure  Form

12.913(c), and file the form with the clerk. You should seek legal advice on constructive service as this is a 
   
complicated area of the law.  If the identity of one parent is unknown, you will need to seek legal advice to 
 
determine the proper way to serve an unknown parent. For more information, see Chapter 49, Florida 
 
Statutes. 
 
 
If personal service is used, the parents have 20 days to answer after being served with your petition. Your 
 
 
case will generally proceed in one of the following ways: 
 
 
DEFAULT. If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court. You must file a Notice for Trial, Florida 
 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924.  Then, if you have filed all of the required papers, you 
 
may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant, to set a final hearing. You must notify 
 
the  child(ren)’s  parents  of the  hearing by using a  Notice  of Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court 
 
 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED. If either parent files an answer which disagrees with or denies anything in your petition and 
 
you  are  unable  to  settle  the  disputed  issues,  you  must  file  a  Notice  for  Trial,  Florida  Supreme  Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.924, to request a final hearing. Some circuits may require the completion 
 
 
of mediation before a final hearing may be set. You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or 
 
 
 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). 
 
 
 
 
At any time, either or both of the children’s parents may petition the court to modify or terminate the order 
 
granting temporary custody. The court shall terminate the order upon a finding that the parent is a fit 
 
parent, or by the consent of the parties.  The court may modify an order granting temporary custody if the 
 
parties consent or if the modification is in the best interest of the children

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
