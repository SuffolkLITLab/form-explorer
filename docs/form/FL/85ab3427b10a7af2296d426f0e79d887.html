When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
This  form  should  be  used  when  a  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  with  Dependent  or  Minor 
 
Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.901(b)(1), has been filed and the parties 
 
have reached an agreement on some or all of the issues at hand. 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  Both parties must sign the agreement and have their 
 
signatures witnessed by a notary public or deputy clerk.  After completing this form, you should file the 
 
original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for 
 
 
your  records.  You  should  then  refer  to  the  instructions  for  your  petition,  answer,  or  answer  and

The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
  
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. 
 
For  further  information,  see  chapter  61,  Florida  Statutes,  and  the  instructions  for  the  petition  and/or

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration.  .  If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
 
pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida

forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also

he or she helps you complete.

MARITAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE 
 
WITH DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN) 
 

                        

 

 

We, {Petitioner’s full legal name}_______________________________________________, and 
  
{Respondent’s  full  legal  name},_________________________________  being  sworn,  certify  that  the 
 
 
 
following statements are true: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

1.   We  were married to  each other on  {date}   

 

 

 

.  

 

2.   Because  of irreconcilable  differences  in  our  marriage  (no  chance  of  staying  together),  we  have  
made this agreement to  settle once and  for all  what we  owe to  each other and  what we  can  expect  
to   receive  from   each  other.     Each of  us   states   that  nothing   has  been   held   back,  that  we   have  
honestly  included everything  we  could  think of in  listing  our assets (everything  we  own and  that  
is owed to  us) and  our debts (everything  we  owe), and  that we  believe the  other has been  open  
and honest in writing  this agreement.  
 

3.   We  have both filed a Family  Law Financial  Affidavit, Florida Family  Law Rules of Procedure Form  
12.902(b) or (c).  Because we have voluntarily  made full and  fair disclosure to  each other of all  our  
assets and  debts, we waive  any  further disclosure  under rule 12.285, Florida Family  Law Rules of  
Procedure.  
 

4.   Each of us  agrees  to  execute and  exchange any  papers that  might be needed  to  complete  this  

agreement, including deeds, title certificates, etc.
