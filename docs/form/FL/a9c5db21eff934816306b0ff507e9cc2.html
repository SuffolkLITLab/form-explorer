INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW FORM 

 
12.981(c)(1) 
 

 
PETITION FOR ADOPTION OF ADULT BY STEPPARENT (11/15) 
 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
This form should be used when a stepparent is adopting his or her spouse’s adult child.  You must obtain 
the written consent of the adult child to be adopted, as well as the written consent of his or her spouse (if 
 
married). 
 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  The name to be given to the adoptee after the adoption 
 
should be used in the heading of the petition.  The stepparent is the petitioner, because he or she is the 
one who is asking the court for legal action.  You must have your signature witnessed by a notary public or 
 
deputy clerk. 
 
 
 
After  completing  this  form,  you  should  file  the  original  with  the  clerk  of  the  circuit  court  in  the  county 
 
where either you or the adoptee live and keep a copy for your records. 
 
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that petitions, pleadings, and documents be filed 
 
electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  a  petition  or  other 
 
pleadings electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file your petition, or 
other  pleading  or  document  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial 
 
 
Administration  2.525,  and  you  must  follow  the  procedures  of  the  judicial  circuit  in  which  you  file.  The 
 
rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
For  your  case  to  proceed,  you  must  have  the  written  consent  of  the  adoptee,  and  his  or  her  spouse  if 
 
 
married. Consent of the birth parent is not required, but written notice of the final hearing on the adoption 
 
must  be  provided to  the  parents,  if any, or proof  of service of process must be filed showing notice  has 
 
 
been served on the parents.  If you know where they live, you must use personal service.  If you absolutely 
do not know where they live, you may use constructive service.  For more information about personal and 
 
constructive service, you should refer the General Instructions for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these  forms and the  instructions to  Florida Family Law  Rules of Procedure Forms 12.910(a) 
 
and  12.913(b)  and  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.913(a).  However,  the  law 
 
regarding constructive service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding that issue. 
 
 
 
 
When you have filed all of the required forms and met the requirements for consent as  outlined above, 
 
you are ready to set a hearing on your petition.  You should check with the clerk of court, family law intake 
staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing, and notify the other party(ies) using a Notice of Hearing 
 
 
(General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.923,  or  other  appropriate  notice  of 
 
 
hearing form.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process  server,  the  Florida  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all  documents  required  or 
 
 
permitted  to  be  served  on  the  other  party  must  be  served  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail)  except  in  certain 
 
circumstances.  You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration.  If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
 
 
Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
 
 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
 
Designation  of  Current  Mailing  and  E-mail  Address,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears.  Please 
 
CAREFULLY  read  the  rules  and  instructions  for:  Certificate  of  Service  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court 
 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration2.516.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
