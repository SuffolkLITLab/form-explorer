      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW
 
 
FORM 12.905(c), 

 
SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION FOR MODIFICATION OF ALIMONY 

(11/15)
 
 
 
When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
This  form  should  be  used  when  you  are  asking  the  court  to  change  a  current  court-ordered  alimony 
obligation.  The  court  can  change  an  order  for  temporary,  permanent  periodic,  durational,  and 
 
rehabilitative alimony if the judge finds that there has been a substantial change in the circumstances of 
 
the parties. Lump sum and bridge-the-gap alimony cannot be modified. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file this form in the county where the original order 
was entered.  If the order was entered in another state, or if the respondent lives in another state, you 
 
should speak with an attorney about where to file this form.  You should file the original with the clerk of 
the circuit court and keep a copy for your records. Because you are filing the petition in this proceeding, 
 
you are also referred to as the petitioner and your spouse as the respondent. 
 

 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 If the other party is 
 

 
 
 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other party in your case of the supplemental 
petition.  Because this petition concerns alimony, you should use personal service. 
in the military service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for 
example, Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
 
 
Form 12.912(a) and Affidavit of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.912(b).  In sum, the law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military 
 
service is very complex and you may wish to consult an attorney regarding this issue. 
 
 
If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your 
 
supplemental petition.  Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 
 
 
DEFAULT...  If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed all 
 
of the required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final

hearing.  You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
UNCONTESTED...  If the respondent files an answer that agrees with everything in your supplemental 
petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the 
required papers, you may call the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  
You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED...  If the respondent files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees 
with or denies anything in your supplemental petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, 
you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.924, after you 
 
have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require 
the completion of mediation before a final hearing may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family 
 
 
law intake staff, or judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If 
 
the respondent files an answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 
 
days using an Answer to Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. 
 
For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.

Special notes... 
 

 
 
If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for Determination of 
 
Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine whether you are eligible to 
 
have filing fees deferred. 
 
 
With this form you must also file the following and serve a copy on the other party: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	  Settlement Agreement, if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues.

a settlement agreement using the pertinent sections contained in Marital Settlement 
Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), or  Marital Settlement 
 
Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida

Procedure Form 12.932.  (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the

Alimony...  In order to modify an order for alimony, a judge must find that there has been a substantial 
change in circumstances.

Motion for Temporary Support with Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved 
Family Law Form 12.947(a), or Motion for Temporary Support with No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(d), whichever is appropriate.  For more
