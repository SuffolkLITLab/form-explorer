INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.980(t) 
 
PETITION FOR INJUNCTION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST STALKING 
 
(10/22) 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
If you are a victim of stalking, you can use this form to ask the court for a protective order prohibiting 
  
stalking. Stalking means the repeated following, harassment, or cyberstalking of one person by another. 
 
Cyberstalk means to engage in a course of conduct to communicate, or to cause to be communicated, 
 
words, images, or language by or through the use of electronic mail or electronic communication, directed 
 
at  a  specific  person,  causing  substantial  emotional  distress  to  that  person  and  serving  no  legitimate 
 
purpose. 
 
 
Because you are making a request to the court, you are called the petitioner.  The person whom you are 
 
asking the court to protect you from is called the respondent.  If you are under the age of eighteen and 
 
have never been married or had the disabilities of nonage removed by a court, and are living at home, 
   
one of your parents or your legal guardian must sign this petition on your behalf. 
 
The parent or legal guardian of any minor child who is living at home may seek an injunction for protection 
 
  
against stalking on behalf of the minor child. 
 
 
If the respondent is your spouse, former spouse, related to you by blood or marriage, living with you now 
 
or has lived with you in the past (if you are or were living as a family), or the other parent of your child(ren), 
 
whether or not you have ever been married or ever lived together, you may, instead, choose to use the 
 
Petition for Injunction for Protection Against Domestic Violence, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
  
Law Form 12.980(a), rather than this form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  You should complete this form (giving as much detail 
 
 
as possible) and sign it the presence of a notary or in front of the clerk of the circuit court in one of the 
 
following: the circuit where you currently or temporarily reside; the circuit where the respondent resides; 
 
 
or the circuit where the stalking occurred. The clerk will take your completed petition to a judge.  You 
 
should keep a copy for your records. If have any questions or need assistance completing this form, the 
 
 
clerk or family law intake staff will help you. There is no filing fee for a petition for protection against 
 
stalking. 
 

 
What should I do if the judge grants my petition? 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
If the facts contained in your petition convince the judge that stalking or cyberstalking exists, the judge 
 
will sign a Temporary Injunction for Protection Against Stalking, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
 
 
Law Form 12.980(u). A temporary injunction is issued without notice to the respondent. The clerk will give 
 
your petition, the temporary injunction, and any other papers filed with your petition to the sheriff or 
 
other law enforcement officer for personal service on the respondent. The temporary injunction will take 
 
effect immediately after the respondent is served with a copy of it. It lasts until a hearing can be held or 
 
for a period of 15 days, whichever comes first. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(t), Petition for Injunction for Protection 
Against Stalking (10/22) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

The court may extend the temporary injunction beyond 15 days for a good reason, which may include 
 
 
failure to obtain service on the respondent. 
 
 
The  temporary  injunction  is  issued  ex  parte.  This  means  that  the  judge  has  considered  only  the 
 
information  presented  by  one  side--YOU.  Section  I  of  the  temporary  injunction  gives  a  date  that  you 
 
should appear in court for a hearing. You will be expected to testify about the facts in your petition.  The 
 
respondent will be given the opportunity to testify at this hearing also. At the hearing, the judge will decide 
 
 
whether to issue a Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against Stalking (After Notice), Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(v), which will remain in effect for a specific time period 
 
 
or until modified or dissolved by the court. If either you or the respondent do not appear at the hearing, 
the temporary injunction may be continued in force, extended, or dismissed, and/or additional orders 
may be granted, including entry of a permanent injunction and the imposition of court costs. You and 
 
the respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction or order issued at the final hearing. 
 
 
IF  EITHER  YOU  OR  THE  RESPONDENT  DO  NOT  APPEAR  AT  THE  FINAL  HEARING,  YOU  WILL  BOTH  BE 
 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER. 
 
 
If the judge signs a temporary or final injunction, the clerk will provide you with the necessary copies. 
  
Make sure that you keep one certified copy of the injunction with you at all times! 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What can I do if the judge denies my petition or 
 
does not issue a Temporary Injunction? 
 

 

 

 

 

If your petition is denied, you may amend your petition by filing a Supplemental Affidavit in Support of 
 
 
Petition for Injunction for Protection, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(g). If the 
 
only ground for not granting an ex parte temporary injunction is no appearance of immediate and present 
 
danger of stalking, the court shall set a full hearing on your petition for injunction at the earliest possible 
 
time. The respondent will be notified by personal service of your petition and the  hearing.  You must 
 
attend the hearing, present facts, and bring evidence that supports your petition; failure to attend the 
 
hearing may result in dismissal of your petition. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should  read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms. The words that are in bold underline are defined in that section. The clerk of 
the  circuit  court  or  family  law  intake  staff  will  help  you  complete  any  necessary  forms.  For  further

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
