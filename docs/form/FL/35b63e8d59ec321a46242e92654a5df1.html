When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 
You  may  use  this  form  to  request  that  the  court  enter  an  order  directing  the  sheriff  or  other  law 
enforcement officer to take a minor child(ren) from the person who currently has physical possession of 
 
 
the child(ren) and deliver the child(ren) to your physical custody or possession.  This form should only 
 
be  used  in  an  emergency  by  a  person  who  has  a  pre-existing  legal  right  to  physical  possession  of  a 
 
 
minor  child.  This  means  that  you  already  have  a  court  order  awarding  you  legal  custody  of  or  time-
sharing with the  child(ren) OR you are the birth mother of one or more  children born out of wedlock 
 
and  no  court  order  has  addressed  any  other  person’s  parental  rights.  Before  proceeding,  you  should 
 
read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the beginning of these forms. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. This form presumes that you want the court to enter an 
 
 
ex  parte  order  without  giving  the  other side  advance  notice  of the  hearing.  You  should  explain your 
 
reasons for why such an ex parte order should be entered in paragraph 7 of this form. After completing 
 
this form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original, 
 
 
along with all of the other forms required, with the clerk of the circuit court  in the county where the 
 
child(ren) is (are) physically located and keep a copy for your records. You should also ask the clerk to 
 
 
 
process your motion though their emergency procedures. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
 
filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule 
 
of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you 
 
file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

   

  

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances.  You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
   
Administration. 
If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
 
pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or  through  the  Florida  Courts  E-Filing  Portal,  you  must  review 
 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link 
 
to the Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents  by  e-mail, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made.

clerk  of court,  judicial  assistant, or  family  law  intake  staff  for  information on the  local  procedure  for

Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, and use personal service 
 
to notify the other party of your motion, the court’s order, if any, and the hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
