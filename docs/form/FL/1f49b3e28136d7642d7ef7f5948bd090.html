TEMPORARY INJUNCTION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST DOMESTIC 
 
 
 
 
VIOLENCE WITHOUT MINOR CHILDREN 
 
 
 
The  Petition  for  Injunction  for  Protection  Against  Domestic  Violence  under  section  741.30,  Florida 
 
 
Statutes, and other papers filed in this Court have been reviewed.  Under the laws of Florida, the Court 
 
has  jurisdiction  of  the  Petitioner  and  the  subject  matter  and  has  jurisdiction  of  the  Respondent  upon 
 
 
service of the temporary injunction. 
 
 
It is intended that this protection order meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. Section 2265 and therefore 
 
intended  that  it  be  accorded  full  faith  and  credit  by  the  court  of  another  state  or  Indian  tribe  and 
 
enforced as if it were the order of the enforcing state or of the Indian tribe. 
 
 
SECTION I.  NOTICE OF HEARING 
 
 
Because  this  Temporary  Injunction  for  Protection  Against  Domestic  Violence  has  been  issued  without 
 
prior  notice  to  Respondent,  the  Petitioner  and  Respondent  are  instructed  that  they  are  scheduled  to 
 
 
appear and testify at a hearing regarding this matter on {date} 
 
  
at 
a.m./p.m., when the Court will consider whether to issue a Final Judgment of Injunction 
 
 
for Protection Against Domestic Violence, which would remain in effect until modified or dissolved by the 
Court, and whether other things should be ordered, including, for example, such matters as support.  The 
 
hearing will be before The Honorable {name} _______________________________________, at {room 
 
name/number, location, address, city} _____________________________________________________ 
 
______________________________________________________________________________,  Florida. 
 
If  Petitioner  and/or  Respondent  do  not  appear,  this  temporary  injunction  may  be  continued  in  force, 
 
 
extended, dismissed, and/or additional orders may be granted, including entry of a permanent injunction 
 
and the imposition of court costs. Petitioner and Respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction 
 
 
or order issued at the final hearing. 
 
 
IF EITHER PETITIONER OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, HE OR SHE WILL BE 
 
 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER. 
 
 
All witnesses and evidence, if any, must be presented at this time.  In cases where temporary support 
 
issues  have  been  alleged  in  the  pleadings,  each  party  is  ordered  to  bring  his  or  her  financial  affidavit

applies  to  the  parties.  It also  appears that  Petitioner  is a victim of domestic violence  by  Respondent, 
 
and/or Petitioner has reasonable cause to believe he/she is in imminent danger of becoming a victim of 
 
domestic  violence  by  Respondent,  and  that  there  is  an  immediate  and  present  danger  of  domestic 
 
 
violence to Petitioner or persons lawfully with Petitioner.

unless  extended by  court order.  If a final  order of injunction is issued, the terms  of this temporary 
 
injunction  will  be  extended  until  service  of  the  final  injunction  is  effected  upon  Respondent.  This 
 
injunction is valid and enforceable in all counties of the State of Florida.  The terms of this injunction 
 
 
may not be changed by either party alone or by both parties together.  Only the Court may modify the 
 
 
terms of this injunction.  Either party may ask the Court to change or end this injunction. 
 
 
Any  violation  of  this  injunction,  whether  or  not  at  the  invitation  of  Petitioner  or  anyone  else,  may 
 
 
subject Respondent to civil or indirect criminal contempt proceedings, including the imposition of a fine

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
