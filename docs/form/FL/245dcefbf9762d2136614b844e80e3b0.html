INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA FAMILY LAW FORM 12.983(c), 
 
ANSWER TO PETITION AND COUNTERPETITION TO DETERMINE 
 
PATERNITY AND FOR RELATED RELIEF (11/15) 
 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 
This form should be used when you are responding to a petition to determine paternity and asking the 
 
court for something different than what was in the petition, such as parental responsibility, time-sharing, 
 
and child support.  The answer is used to admit or deny the allegations contained in the petition, and 
 
 
  
the counterpetition is used to ask for whatever you want the court to do for you.  The other party has 20 
 
days to answer your counterpetition after being served with your counterpetition. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
 
   
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should then file the original with the clerk of the circuit 
 
court in the county where the petition was filed and keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
 
filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule 
 
of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you 
 
file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 
 

 
 

   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
circumstances.  You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Rules  of 
 
 
Judicial Administration.  If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving 
 
pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or  through  the  Florida  Courts  E-Filing  Portal,  you  must  review 
 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link 
 
to the Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
 
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
  
 
12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your  signature  appears. 
 
Please CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme 
 
Court  Approved Family Law  Form 12.914;  Designation of  Current  Mailing  and E-mail Address,  Florida 
 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration2.516. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(c), Answer to Petition and 
 
 
Counterpetition to Determine Paternity and for Related Relief (11/15) 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 

 
You have 20 days to file an answer or answer and counterpetition to the other party’s petition.  A copy 
 
 
 
 
 
of  this form, along with all of the other forms required with this answer and counterpetition, must be 
 
mailed or hand delivered to the other party in your case. 
 
If  you  deny  that  the  person  named  in  the  petition  is  the  child(ren)’s  father,  a  Motion  for  Scientific 
 
 
 
Paternity Testing Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.983(e), should be filed.  This is 
used to ask the court to order a scientific test to determine who is the child(ren)’s father. 
 
 
 
After you file an answer and counterpetition, the case will then generally proceed as follows: 
 
 
UNCONTESTED.  This  case  is  uncontested  if  you  and  the  other  party  agree  on  all  issues  raised  in  the 
 
petition  and  the  counterpetition.  If  this  is  the  case,  and  you  and  the  other  party  have  complied  with 
 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, either party may call the clerk, family law intake 
 
 
staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing. If you request the hearing, you must notify the other party 
 
of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
CONTESTED.  This case is contested if you and the other party disagree on any issues raised in the petition 
 
or  counterpetition.  If  you  are  unable  to  settle  the  disputed  issues,  either  party  may  file  a  Notice  for 
Trial,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.924,  after  you  have  complied  with 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of 
 
 
mediation  before  a final  hearing may be  set.  You should contact  the  clerk,  family  law  intake  staff,  or 
 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing). 
 

 
   

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants  for some basic 
 
 
information. The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there. For further 
 
information, see chapter 742, Florida Statutes. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Special notes... 
 

 

 

 

 
If the child(ren)’s father signed papers at the hospital acknowledging that he was the father, paternity was 
 
 
 
 
 
established as a matter of law.  This should be indicated on page 2, section 10a of the counterpetition part 
 
of this form.  With this answer, you must file the following: 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  Uniform  Child Custody  Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida Supreme

Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed with 
 
this answer, unless you and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
  Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). (If 
 
 
you do not know the other party’s income, you may file this worksheet after his or her financial 
 
 
 
affidavit has been filed.) 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
  Parenting Plan, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), 12.995(b), or (c). If 
 
 
 
the  parents  have  reached  an  agreement,  a  signed  and  notarized  Parenting  Plan  should  be 
 
 
attached.  If the  parents  have  not  reached  an  agreement,  a  proposed  Parenting  Plan  may  be 
 
filed. 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 
Many  jurisdictions  may  require  the  completion  of  mediation  before  a  final  hearing  may  be  set.  A 
 
 
parenting course must be completed prior to entry of the final judgment. You should contact the office 
of  your  local  clerk  of  court,  family  law  intake  staff,  or  the  judicial  assistant  about  requirements  for 
 
parenting courses or mediation where you live. 
 
 
Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. If the parties are unable to agree on parenting arrangements and a 
 
time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide as part of establishing a Parenting Plan. The judge will decide 
the  parenting  arrangements  and  time-sharing  schedule  based  on  the  child(ren)’s  best  interests. 
 
 
Regardless  of  whether  there  is  an  agreement  between  the  parties,  the  court  reserves  jurisdiction  to 
 
modify issues relating to minor child(ren). 
 
The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case. 
This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting 
 
 
issues. The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is being 
 
served. For more information, you may consult section 61.401 and 61.405, Florida Statutes. 
 
 
 
Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your answer and 
 
 
counterpetition.  If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you should 
 
speak with an attorney before going any further.

Child Support. The court may order one parent to pay child support to assist the other parent inmeeting 
 
 
the child(ren)’s material needs. Both parents are required to provide financial support, but one parent 
 
may be ordered to pay a portion of his or her support for the child(ren) to the otherparent. 
 
 
Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid. These guidelines 
 
are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the financial contributions of 
 
both parents. You should file a financial affidavit, and the other parent will be required to do the same. 
 
 
From your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be

paid. Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and 
 
vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in 
 
seemingly similar situations. 
 
 
Parenting Plan. In all cases involving minor or dependent child(ren), a Parenting Plan shall be approved 
or established by the court. If the parties have reached an agreement, you should file a Parenting Plan, 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.995(a), 12.995(b), or 12.995(c) which addresses the 
 
time-sharing schedule for the child(ren). If you have not reached an agreement, a proposed Parenting 
 
Plan may be filed.  A Parenting Plan will be established by thecourt. 
 
 
Final Judgments. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Paternity, Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.983(g), which the judge may use. You should check with the clerk, family 
 
law intake staff, or judicial assistant to see if you need to bring it with you to the hearing.  If so, you should 
 
 
 
type or print the heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties’ names, and 
 
 
leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial. 
 
 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you. A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
 
he or she helps you complete.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
