(06/18)
 
 

 

 

   

   

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 
This form may be used to obtain constructive service (also called service by publication or posting) in an 
 
 
action involving a Joint Petition for Adoption by Stepparent. You may use constructive service for any person 
 
whose  consent  is  required  under  the  Florida  Statutes  and  who  has  NOT  executed  a  consent  to  the 
 
adoption. This includes: 
  

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	  The mother of the minor child(ren); 
 
 
  The father of the minor child(ren), if: 
 

mother; 
 

 
  The minor child(ren) were conceived or born while the father was married to the 
 

 

 

 

 
  The minor child(ren) is/are his children by adoption; 
 
 
  The  minor  child(ren)  have  been  adjudicated  by  the  court  to  be  his  child(ren) 
 

 
 
before the date a petition for termination of parental rights is filed; 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
	 

 
	  He  has  filed  an  affidavit  of  paternity  or  was  listed  on  the  minor  child’s  birth 
 
 
certificate  before  the  date  the  petition  for  termination  of  parental  rights  was 
 
 
filed; or 
 
In the  case of an unmarried biological father, he  has acknowledged in writing, 
 
 
signed in the present of a competent witness, that he is the father of the minor, 
 
has  filed  such  acknowledgment  with  the  Office  of  Vital  Statistics  for  the 
 
Department of Health within the required timeframes, and has complied with the 
 
 
 
requirements of section 63.062(2), Florida Statutes; and 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  Any person lawfully entitled to custody of the minor child if required by the court. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The location of the person must be unknown. You must complete and file a Stepparent Adoption:  Affidavit 
 
of Diligent Search, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.981(a)(4). This is a complicated 
 
area of the law and you should consult an attorney before using constructive service. 
 
 
You should complete this form by typing or printing the appropriate information in black ink.  You must 
 
 
insert the other party’s name- last known address- physical description, including but not limited to age, 
 
race, hair and eye color, and approximate height and weight of the person- the minor child(ren)’s date of 
 
 
birth- and the minor child(ren)’s place of birth. File this form with the clerk of the circuit court  in the 
 
 
county where your petition was filed.  You should keep a copy for your records. 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be

Parental Rights and Stepparent Adoption (06/18) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
  
 

filed electronically except in certain circumstances.  Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance with Florida Rule of 
 
 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
 
 
The rules and procedures  should be carefully  read and followed.  
 
After the Stepparent Adoption: Affidavit of Diligent Search, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
12.981(a)(4) is filed, the clerk will sign this form. You will need to publish notice once each week for four 
 
consecutive weeks in a “qualified” newspaper in the county where the person was last known to have 
 
 
resided.  When in doubt, ask the clerk which newspapers are “qualified.”  The newspaper will charge you 
 
for this service.  If you cannot afford to pay the cost of publishing this notice, you may ask the clerk to post 
 
the notice at a place designated for such postings.  You will need to file an Application for Determination 
 
of Civil Indigent  Status,  which you can obtain from the clerk.  If the  clerk  determines that you cannot 
 
 
afford these costs, the clerk will post the notice of action.  You are responsible for locating a “qualified” 
 
 
newspaper in the county where the other party last resided and paying the cost of publication. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
 
beginning of these forms.  For further information, see rule 12.070, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure, 
 
rule  1.070,  Florida  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  sections  61.501–61.542,  Florida  Statutes  and  chapter  49,

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
  
 
circumstances.  You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
   
 
Administration. 
If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
 
 
pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida 
 
 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the 
 
 
Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court 
 
in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e- mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears.  Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E- mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
