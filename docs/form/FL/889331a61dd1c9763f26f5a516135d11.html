LAW FORM 12.950(d)
 

 
SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION TO PERMIT RELOCATION WITH 

MINOR OR DEPENDENT CHILD(REN)
 

 
(02/18)
 

 

When should this form be used? 

This form should be used when you are asking the court to permit the relocation of your 
principal residence and : 

	 

1.	  You plan to relocate your residence more than 50 miles from your principal residence at the 
time of entry of the last order which established or modified primary residence, custody, 
visitation, or time-sharing; 

2.	  The court has not entered an order granting permission to relocate. 

	 

	 

3.	  The relocation will be for a period of 60 consecutive days or more, not including any 
absence for purposes of vacation, education, or health care for the child(ren). 

4.	  Your order regarding custody, primary residence, visitation, time-sharing or parenting plan 

	 

was entered before October 1, 2009, and the order does not expressly govern the relocation 
of the child(ren); was entered on or after October 1, 2006; or your case was pending on 
October 1, 2009. 

This form should be typed or printed in black ink. You must fill in all sections of the form. After 
completing  the  form,  you  should  sign  the  form  before  a  notary  public  or  deputy  clerk.  You 
should  file  this  form  in  the  county  where  the  original  order  was  entered. 
If  the  order  was 
entered in another state, or if the child(ren) live(s) in another state, you should speak with an 
attorney about where to file this form.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit 
court and keep a copy for your records. 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 

The  Florida  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all  petitions,  pleadings,  and 
documents  be  filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants 
may  file  petitions  or  other  pleadings  or  documents  electronically;  however,  they  are  not 
required to do so.  If you choose  to  file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you 
must do so in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow 
the  procedures  of  the  judicial  circuit  in  which  you  file.  The  rules  and  procedures  should  be 
carefully read and followed. 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.950(d), Supplemental Petition to 
Permit Relocation with Minor or Dependent Child(ren)(02/18) 





             IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION
 

 

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or 
certified  process  server,  the  Florida  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic 
mail  (e-mail)  except  in  certain  circumstances.  You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format 
requirements  set  forth  in  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration.  If  you  elect  to  participate  in 
electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving  pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or 
through  the  Florida  Courts  E-Filing  Portal,  you  must  review  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial 
Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
Judicial  Administration  provided  under  either  Family  Law  Forms:  Getting  Started,  or  Rules  of 
Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 

SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANTS MAY SERVE DOCUMENTS BY E-MAIL; HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-
mail, the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 

To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using 
the Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
Law  Form  12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your 
signature appears. Please CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service 
(General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.914;  Designation  of  Current 
Mailing  and  E-mail  Address,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.915;  and 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 

What should I do next? 

For your case to proceed, you must properly notify the other parent and every other person 
entitled to, access, time-sharing, or visitation with the child(ren) in your case of the 
supplemental petition.  “Other Person” means an individual who is not the parent but with 
whom the child resides pursuant to court order, or who has the right of access to, time-sharing 
with, or visitation with the child(ren).  If you know where he or she lives, you should use 
personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive 
service.  You may also be able to use constructive service if the other party resides in another 
state or country.  However, if constructive service is used, the court may only grant limited 
relief.  For more information on constructive service, see Notice of Action For, Florida Supreme 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.913(a)(2), and Affidavit of Diligent Search and Inquiry, 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b).  If the other party is in the military 
service of the United States, additional steps for service may be required.  See, for example, 
Memorandum for Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
Form 12.912(a).  The law regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the 
military service is very complex.  If you have any questions about service, you may wish to 
consult an attorney regarding these issues. 

If personal service is used, the other party has 20 days to answer after being served with your 
supplemental petition.  Your case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.950(d), Supplemental Petition to 
Permit Relocation with Minor or Dependent Child(ren)(02/18) 

DEFAULT. If after 20 days, no answer has been filed, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have 
filed all of the required papers, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial 
assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify the other party of the hearing by using a Notice 
of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other 
appropriate notice of hearing form. 

UNCONTESTED.  If the respondent files either an answer that agrees with everything in your 
supplemental petition or an answer and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory 
disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, 
or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify the other party of the hearing by 
using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, 
or other appropriate notice of hearing form.  

CONTESTED.  If the respondent files either an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which 
disagrees with or denies anything in your supplemental petition, and you are unable to settle 
the disputed issues, you should file a Notice for Trial, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
Law Form 12.924, after you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the 
required papers. Some circuits may require the completion of mediation before a final hearing 
may be set. Then you should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for 
instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If the respondent files an answer 
and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to 
Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 

Where can I look for more information? 

Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” 
found at the beginning of these forms.  The words that are in “bold underline” in these 
instructions are defined there.  For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.  

Special notes... 

If you do not have the money to pay the filing fee, you may obtain an Application for 
Determination of Civil Indigent Status from the clerk, fill it out, and the clerk will determine 
whether you are eligible to have filing fees deferred. 

If there is a domestic violence case and you want to keep your address confidential for safety 
reasons, do not enter the address, telephone number, and fax information at the bottom of this 
form.  Instead, file a Request for Confidential Filing of Address, Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.980(h). 

With this form, you must also file the following: 

  Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) Affidavit, Florida 
 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.950(d), Supplemental Petition to 
Permit Relocation with Minor or Dependent Child(ren)(02/18) 

  Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 

12.902(e).  (If you do not know the other party’s income, you may file this worksheet after 
his or her financial affidavit has been served on you.) 

	  Agreement for Relocation, if you have reached an agreement on any or all of the issues 
	 
attach the proposed Agreement For Relocation with Minor Child(ren). Florida Supreme 
Court Approved Family Law 12.950(a).  Both parties must sign this agreement before a 
notary public.  Any issues on which you are unable to agree will be considered contested 
and settled by the judge at the final hearing. 

	  Notice of Social Security Number, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
	 

Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the supplemental 
petition on the respondent, if not filed at the time of the supplemental petition, unless you 
and the other party have agreed not to exchange these documents.) 

12.902(j), if not previously filed. 
Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). 

 
  Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of 

   

Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d). 

Updating Information.  A parent or other person seeking to relocate has a continuing duty to 
provide current and updated information required by the relocation statute when that 
information becomes known. 

Parenting and Time-Sharing.  If you and the other parent and every other person entitled to 
access to or time-sharing with the child(ren) are unable to agree on the parenting arrangements 
and a time-sharing schedule, a judge will decide for you as part of establishing a Parenting Plan.  
The judge will decide the parenting arrangements and a time-sharing schedule based upon the 
child(ren)’s best interests.  Regardless of whether there is an agreement, the court reserves 
jurisdiction to modify issues relating to the minor child(ren). 

Failure to obtain an Order prior to relocation renders the supplemental petition to relocate 
legally insufficient. 

The judge may request a parenting plan recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in 
your case.  This means that a neutral person will review your situation and report to the judge 
concerning parenting issues.  The purpose of such intervention is to be sure that the best 
interests of the child(ren) is (are) being served.  For more information, you may consult section 
61.13, Florida Statutes. 

If one has not already been completed, the court may require the completion of a parenting 
course before a final hearing is set.  You should contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or 
judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses or mediation where you live. 

Child Support.  Both parents are required to provide financial support for their minor or 
dependent child(ren); however, the court may order one parent to pay child support to  the 
other parent.  Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be 
paid.  These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into 
account the financial contributions of both parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) 
spend with each parent.  You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit. Florida Family Law Rules 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.950(d), Supplemental Petition to 
Permit Relocation with Minor or Dependent Child(ren)(02/18) 

of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c), and the other parent will be required to do the same.  From 
your financial affidavits, you should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should 
be paid using the Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
Form 12.902(e).  Because the child support guidelines take several factors into consideration, 
change over time, and vary from state to state, your child support obligation may be more or 
less than that of other people in seemingly similar situations. 

Temporary Relief.  If you need temporary relief regarding relocation of the minor child(ren), 
complete paragraph twelve contained in the Supplemental Petition To Permit Relocation of 
Minor Child(ren).  

Final Judgment Form.  These family law forms contain a Final Judgment/Supplemental Final 
Judgment Permitting Relocation, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.950(i), 
which the judge may use.  You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial 
assistant to see if you need to bring it with you to the hearing.  If so, you should type or print the 
heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties’ names, and leave 
the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial. 

Nonlawyer. Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer 
helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from 
Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  
A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and 
telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
