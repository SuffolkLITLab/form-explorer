1. 

 
This injunction is valid and enforceable in all counties of the State of Florida.  Violation of this 
 
injunction  should  be  reported  to  the  appropriate  law  enforcement  agency.  Law  enforcement 
 
officers  of  the  jurisdiction  in  which  a  violation  of  this  injunction  occurs  shall  enforce  the 
 
provisions of this injunction and are authorized to arrest without a warrant pursuant to Section 
 
901.15, Florida Statutes, for any violation of its provision, which constitutes a criminal act under 
 
Section 784.047, Florida Statutes. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Should any  Florida law enforcement  officer having jurisdiction have  probable cause  to  believe 
 
that  Respondent  has  knowingly  violated  this  injunction,  the  officer  may  arrest  Respondent, 
 
confine  him/her  in  the  county  jail  without  bail,  and  shall  bring  him/her  before  the  Initial 
 
Appearance Judge on the next regular court day so that Respondent can be dealt with according 
 
to law. The arresting agent shall notify the State Attorney's Office immediately after arrest. THIS 
 
INJUNCTION IS ENFORCEABLE IN ALL COUNTIES OF FLORIDA AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
 
MAY EFFECT ARRESTS PURSUANT TO SECTION 901.15(6), FLORIDA STATUTES.

not been an arrest, Petitioner may contact the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the county in which 
 
the  violation  occurred  and  complete  an  affidavit  in  support  of  the  violation  or Petitioner may 
 
contact the State Attorney’s office for assistance in filing an action for indirect civil contempt or 
 
indirect  criminal  contempt.  Upon  receiving  such  a  report,  the  State  Attorney  is  hereby 
 
appointed to prosecute such violations by indirect criminal contempt proceedings, or the State 
 
Attorney may decide to file a criminal charge, if warranted by the evidence.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
