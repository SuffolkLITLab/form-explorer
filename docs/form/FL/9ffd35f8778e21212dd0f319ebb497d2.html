FORM 12.970(b) 
 
PETITION FOR CONCURRENT CUSTODY BY EXTENDED FAMILY 
 
(06/21) 
 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
This  form  should  be  used  by  an  extended  family  member  to  obtain  concurrent  custody of  a  child  or 
 
children  pursuant  to  Chapter  751,  Florida  Statutes.  This  form  should  not  be  used  if  you  are  a  parent 
 
seeking to establish parental responsibility or time-sharing with a child or children. “Concurrent custody” 
 
means that an eligible extended family member is awarded custodial rights to care for a child or children 
 
concurrently with the child(ren)’s parent or parents. 
 
 
An Extended Family Member is: 
 
A relative of a minor child within the third degree by blood or marriage to the parent; 
 
OR 
 
The stepparent of a minor child if the stepparent is currently married to the parent of the child and is not 
 
a  party  in  a  pending  dissolution,  separate  maintenance,  domestic  violence,  or  other  civil  or  criminal 
 
proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction involving one or both of the children’s parents as an 
 
 
adverse party; 
 
OR 
 
An individual who qualifies as “fictive kin.” As defined in section 39.01, Florida Statutes, fictive kin means a 
 
 
person unrelated by birth, marriage, or adoption who has an emotionally significant relationship, which 
 
possesses the characteristics of a family relationship, to a child. 
 
 
You may file a Petition for Concurrent Custody if: 
 
You have the signed, notarized consents of the children’s legal parents; 
 
OR 
 
You are an extended family member who is caring full time for the children in the role of a substitute 
 
 
 
 
parent and with whom the children are presently living. 
 
 
In addition, you must currently have physical custody of the children or  have had physical custody of the 
 
 
children for at least 10 days in any 30-day period within the last 12 months; and not have signed, written 
 
documentation from a parent which is sufficient to enable you to do all the things necessary to care for 
 
 
the children. 
 
 
If you do not meet the qualifications above, you should talk to an attorney about other options. You may 
 
also report any suspected abuse, abandonment, or neglect to the appropriate authorities. 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. After completing this form, you should sign the form 
 
before a notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
 
 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
process  server,  the  Florida  Rules  of  General  Practice  and  Judicial  Administration  now  require  that  all 
 
documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-
mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth 
 
in  the  Rules  of  General  Practice  and  Judicial  Administration.  If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic 
 
service, which means serving or receiving pleadings by  electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida 
 
Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 
You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of General Practice and Judicial 
 
Administration provided under  either Family Law  Forms:  Getting  Started, or Rules of  Court  in the  A-Z 
Topical Index. 
 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial Administration

IF  YOU  HAVE  SIGNED  AND  NOTARIZED  WAIVERS  OF  SERVICE  OF  PROCESS  AND  CONSENTS  from  the 
 
child(ren)’s parents, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant, to set a final 
 
hearing.  You must notify the child(ren)’s parents of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 
 
 
 
If one of the parents is deceased, you must file a certified copy of the proof of death. 
 
 
If one of the minor children’s parents objects to the Petition for Concurrent Custody in writing, the court 
may not grant the petition even if the other parent consents, in writing, to the entry of the order. If a 
 
 
parent objects, you have the option of converting the Petition to a Petition for Temporary Custody by 
 
Extended  Family,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.970(a).  If  the  Petition  is  not 
converted  into  a  Petition  for  Temporary  Custody  by  Extended  Family,  it  shall  be  dismissed  without 
 
 
prejudice.

At any time, the Petitioner or either or both of the children’s parents may move the court to terminate 
 
 
the order granting concurrent custody. The court shall terminate the order upon a finding that either or 
 
both of the children’s parents objects to the order. The fact that the order for concurrent custody has 
 
been terminated does not preclude any person who is otherwise eligible to petition for temporary custody 
 
 
from filing such petition.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
