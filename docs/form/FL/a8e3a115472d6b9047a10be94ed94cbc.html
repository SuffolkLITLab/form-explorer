TEMPORARY INJUNCTION FOR PROTECTION AGAINST STALKING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 
The Petition for Injunction for Protection Against Stalking under Section 784.0485, Florida Statutes, and 
 
other papers filed in this Court have been reviewed.  Under the laws of Florida, the Court has jurisdiction 
of the Petitioner and the subject matter, and has jurisdiction of the Respondent upon service of the 
 
temporary injunction.  The term Petitioner as used in this injunction includes the person on whose 
 
behalf this injunction is entered. 
 
 
It is intended that this protection order meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. Section 2265 and 
 
 
therefore intended that it be accorded full faith and credit by the court of another state or Indian tribe 
 
and enforced as if it were the order of the enforcing state or of the Indian tribe. 
 
 
SECTION I.  NOTICE OF HEARING 
 
 
Because this Temporary Injunction for Protection Against Stalking has been issued without notice to 
Respondent, Petitioner and Respondent are instructed that they are scheduled to appear and testify at a 
 
hearing regarding this matter on {date} _______________________, at ________ a.m./p.m., when the 
Court will consider whether it should issue a Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against Stalking, 
which shall remain in effect until modified or dissolved by the Court, and whether other things should be 
 
 
ordered. The hearing will be before The Honorable {name} ____________________________, at the 
following address: _________________________________________________________, Florida.  If 
 
Petitioner and/or Respondent do not appear, this temporary injunction may be continued in force, 
extended, or dismissed, and/or additional orders may be granted, including entry of a permanent 
 
injunction and the imposition of court costs.  All witnesses and evidence, if any, must be presented at 
 
this time. Petitioner and Respondent will be bound by the terms of any injunction or order issued at 
 
the final hearing. 
 
IF EITHER PETITIONER OR RESPONDENT DO NOT APPEAR AT THE FINAL HEARING, HE OR SHE WILL BE 
 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF ANY INJUNCTION OR ORDER ISSUED IN THIS MATTER.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
