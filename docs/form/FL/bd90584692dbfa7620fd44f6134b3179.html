LAW FORM 12.903(a) 
 
ANSWER, WAIVER, AND REQUEST FOR COPY OF FINAL JUDGMENT OF 
  
DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE 
 
(02/18) 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

This form should be used when you have been served with a petition for dissolution of marriage 
 
and you do not wish to contest it or appear at a hearing.  If you file this form, you are admitting all 
 
of the allegations in the petition, saying that you do not need to be notified of or appear at the final 
 
hearing, and that you would like a copy of the final judgment mailed to you. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This form should be typed or printed in black ink, and your signature should be witnessed by a 
 
notary public or deputy clerk.  After completing this form, you should sign the form before a notary 
public.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the 
 
petition was filed and keep a copy for your records.  The person filing the petition in a dissolution of 
 
marriage proceeding is also referred to as the petitioner and his or her spouse as the respondent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents 
 
be filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose 
 
to file your pleadings or other documents electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida 
 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the  judicial circuit in 
 
 
which you file. The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

You have 20 days to answer after being served with your spouse’s petition.  A copy of this form, 
 
along with all of the other forms required with this answer and waiver, must be mailed, e-mailed, or 
 
hand delivered to your spouse. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 
After the initial service of process of the petition or supplemental petition by the Sheriff or certified 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required 
 
or permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in

certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the 
 
 
 
Rules of Judicial Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means 
receiving pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must 
 
review  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial  Administration  2.516.  You  may  find  this  rule  at  www.flcourts.org 
 
through  the  link  to  the  Rules  of  Judicial  Administration  provided  under  either  Family  Law  Forms: 
 
 
Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation  of  Current  Mailing  and  E-mail  Address,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law 
 
 
Form  12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your  signature 
 
 
appears.  Please  CAREFULLY  read  the  rules  and  instructions  for:  Certificate  of  Service  (General), 
 
 
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail 
 
 
Address,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.915;  and  Florida  Rule  of  Judicial 
 
Administration 2.516. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at 
the beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are 
defined there.  For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes.

Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d), if the case involves a dependent or 
minor child(ren). 
 

 

 

  Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
 
 

 

 

12.902(e), if the case involves a dependent or minor child(ren).  (If you do not know your

  Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Dependent or Minor 
 
Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(1), or Marital

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(a), Answer, Waiver, and Request for 
 
Copy of Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage (02/18) 

 

 
 

12.902(j). 
 
Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). 
 
(This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, if not filed at the time

  Certificate of Compliance with Mandatory Disclosure, Florida Family Law Rules of 

 

 

 

Procedure Form 12.932. (This must be filed within 45 days of service of the petition on you, 
if not filed at the time you file this answer, unless you and the other party have agreed not 
to exchange these documents.) 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

Parenting Plan and Time-Sharing. By filing this answer and waiver, you are agreeing to any 
 
parenting plan and time-sharing requests in the petition. The judge may request a parenting plan 
 
recommendation or appoint a guardian ad litem in your case.  This means that a neutral person will 
 
review your situation and report to the judge concerning parenting issues. The purpose of such 
intervention is to be sure that the best interests of the child(ren) is (are) being served. For more 
 
information, you may consult section 61.13, Florida Statutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
A parenting course must be completed prior to entry of a final judgment.  You should contact the 
clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant about requirements for parenting courses where 
 
you live. 
 
 
Listed below are some terms with which you should become familiar before completing your answer 
 
to the petition.  If you do not fully understand any of the terms below or their implications, you 
 
should speak with an attorney before going any further. 
 
 
  Shared Parental Responsibility 
 
 
  Sole Parental Responsibility 
 
 
  Supervised Time-Sharing 
 
 
 
  No contact 
 
 
  Parenting Plan 
 
 
 
  Parenting Plan Recommendation 
 
 
 
  Time-Sharing Schedule 
 
 
 
 
Child Support.  By filing this answer and waiver, you are agreeing to any requests for child support 
 
in the petition.   Both parents are required to provide financial support for their minor or 
 
dependent child(ren); however, the court may order  one parent  to pay child support  to the other 
parent. Florida has adopted guidelines for determining the amount of child support to be paid.  
These guidelines are based on the combined income of both parents and take into account the 
 
financial contributions of both parents and the number of overnights the child(ren) spend with each 
 
parent.  You must file a Family Law Financial Affidavit, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 
 
12.902(b) or (c), and your spouse will be required to do the same.  From your financial affidavits, you 
should be able to calculate the amount of child support that should be paid using the Child Support 
 
Guidelines Worksheet, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e).  Because the child 
 
support guidelines take several factors into consideration, change over time, and vary from state to

state, your child support obligation may be more or less than that of other people in seemingly 
 
similar situations. 
 
 
Alimony.  By filing this answer and waiver, you are agreeing to any requests for alimony in the 
 
petition. Alimony may be awarded to a spouse if the judge finds that one spouse has an actual need 
 
for it and also finds that the other spouse has the ability to pay.  If you want alimony, you must 
 
request it in writing in a counterpetition and should not use this form. If you do not request 
alimony in writing before the final hearing, it is waived (you may not request it later).  You may 
 
request permanent alimony, bridge-the-gap alimony, durational alimony, , and/or rehabilitative 
 
alimony. If alimony is awarded, the judge may order periodic payments, payments in lump sum, or 
both. 
 
 
Marital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities.  Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital 
 
 
assets and marital liabilities.  “Equitable” does not necessarily mean “equal.”  Many factors, 
 
including child support, time-sharing and alimony awards, may lead the court to make an unequal 
 
(but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities.  Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities 
 
are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the court determines belong to, or are the 
responsibility of, only one of the parties.  By filing this answer and waiver, you are agreeing to any 
requests in the petition regarding division of assets and liabilities. 
 
 
Final Judgment.  You should receive a copy of the Final Judgment in the mail.  If, for some reason 
 
you do not, you should contact the clerk’s office to request a copy.  It is important for you to review 
a copy of the Final Judgment in your case to see what happened and to know what you must do and 
 
what you are entitled to receive. 
 
 
Nonlawyer.  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.  If a nonlawyer 
 
helps you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, 
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer 
 
helping you fill out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on 
 
 
the bottom of the last page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
