      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.950(b) 
 
MOTION FOR ORDER PERMITTING RELOCATION BY AGREEMENT 
(02/18) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
This form should be used when the parents and every other person entitled to access to, visitation, or 
 
time-sharing with the minor child(ren) are in agreement and are asking the court to permit the 
 
relocation of the child(ren).  “Other Person” means an individual who is not the parent, but with whom 
 
the child resides pursuant to court order, or who has the right of access to, time-sharing with, or 
visitation with the child(ren).  You may file a Motion for Order Permitting Relocation with Agreement if 
the following are true: 
 
 
 
  One of the parents or a person entitled to access to or time-sharing with the children wishes to 
 
relocate the child(ren) to a residence more than 50 miles from the child(ren)’s principal place of 
residence at the time of the last order establishing or modifying time-sharing or at time of filing of 
 
the pending action. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  There is an existing cause of action, judgment, or decree of record pertaining to the child(ren)’s 
 

 

residence or time sharing schedule. 
 
 

 

 

 
  The parents and every other person entitled to access to or time-sharing with the children have 
signed a written agreement, Agreement for Relocation with Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form, 12.950(a), or similar form which: 
 
1.  Reflects the consent to the relocation; 
2.  Defines an access or time-sharing schedule for the non-relocating parent and any other persons 
 
who are entitled to access or time-sharing; and 
 

   

 

 

 

3.  Describes, if necessary, any transportation arrangements related to access or time-sharing. 
 

 

 
 
  Your order regarding custody, primary residence, the parenting plan, time-sharing, or access to or 

 

 

with the child(ren) was entered before October 1, 2009 and the order does not expressly govern the 
relocation of the child(ren); was entered on or after October 1, 2009; or your case was pending on 
 
October 1, 2009. 
 

 

 

 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink.  You must fill in all sections of the form.  If you are an 
 
 
“other person” entitled to access, visitation, or time-sharing with the child(ren), substitute your name 
for Petitioner or Respondent  in the form.  After completing the form, you should sign the form before a 
notary public or deputy clerk. You should file the form in the county where the original order or 
judgment was entered.  If the order or judgment was entered in another state, or if the child(ren) live(s) 
in another state, you should speak with an attorney about where to file this form.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-SERVICE ELECTION 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving pleadings 
 
by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida Rule of 
Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the Rules of 
 
Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court in the 
 
A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

After completing this form, you should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court where there is 
 
an existing cause of action, judgment, or decree of record pertaining to the child(ren)’s residence or 
time-sharing schedule and keep a copy for your records.  The original Agreement for Relocation with 
Minor Child(ren) should be attached to Motion or filed with the clerk of the circuit court at the same 
time. 
 
 
 
If both parties agree, the court may ratify the Agreement without the necessity of an evidentiary 
 
hearing.  You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant for the proper way 
 
to submit the Motion and a proposed Final Judgment/Supplemental Final Judgment Granting 
 
Relocation, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.950(i), to the judge.  If one or more of 
 
the parties to the Agreement timely requests a hearing in writing within 10 days after the date the 
Agreement is filed with the court, then you must notify the other party(ies) of the hearing by using a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Motion for Order Permitting Relocation by Agreement, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
 
Law Form 12.950(b)(02/18) 
 

 

Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other 
appropriate notice of hearing form.  The court will then enter an order after hearing.   If a hearing is not 
 
timely requested, the court shall presume that relocation is in the best interest of the child(ren) and may 
 
ratify the Agreement without an evidentiary hearing 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 
Before proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in “bold underline” in these instructions are defined 
 
 
 
there.  For further information, see chapter 61, Florida Statutes. 

  

 

 

 

 

If your case involved a modification of any provision relating to child support, you should also check with 
 
the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which you are filing the Motion for Order Permitting 
 
Relocation with Minor Child(ren) and Agreement for Relocation with Minor Child(ren) to determine if 
 
any other forms must be filed. 
 
Nonlawyer.  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer.  If a nonlawyer helps 
 
you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida 
 
 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Former 12.900(a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you 
 
fill out these forms must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last 
page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
