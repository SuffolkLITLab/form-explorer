This form should be used to ask the other party in your case to answer certain standard questions 
 
 
in writing. These questions are called interrogatories, and they must relate to your case.  If the 
 
other  party  fails  to  answer  the  questions, you may  ask  the  judge  to order  the  other  party  to 
 
 
answer the questions.  (You cannot ask these questions before the petition has been filed.) 
 
 
 
The questions in this form should be used in original proceedings or enforcement proceedings 
 
and are meant to supplement the information provided in the Financial Affidavit, Florida Family 
 
Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or (c). You should read all of the questions in this form to 
 
determine which questions, if any, the other party needs to answer in order to provide you with 
 
information  not  covered  in  the  financial  affidavit  forms.  If  there  are  questions  to  which  you 
 
 
already know the answer, you may choose not to ask them. 
 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink. You must complete the box at the beginning of 
 
 
this form to indicate which questions you are requesting that the other party answer. 
 
You must serve the other party with this document and a copy of these interrogatories and a copy 
 
of  the  Notice of Service  of  Standard  Family  Law Interrogatories,  Florida  Family  Law  Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.930(a), if by mail or hand delivery. You must serve these interrogatories and 
 
a copy of the Notice,  if by email. Service must be in accordance with Florida Rule of  General 
 
 
 
 
 
Practice and Judicial Administration 2.516. 
 
 
 
You should also keep a copy for your records. You should not file this form with the clerk of the 
 
circuit  court.  However,  you  must  file  the  Notice  of  Service  of  Standard  Family  Law 
 
Interrogatories, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 12.930(a), to tell the court that you have 
 
 
sent this form to the other party.

The Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, 
 
pleadings,  and  documents  be  filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-
represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or  other  pleadings  or  documents  electronically; 
 
however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file your pleadings or other documents 
 
 
electronically, you must do so in accordance with Florida Rule of General Practice and Judicial

certified process server, the Florida Rules of General Practice and Judicial Administration now 
 
require that all documents required or permitted to be served on the other party must be served 
 
 
by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain circumstances. You must strictly comply with the 
 
format  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Florida  Rules  of  General  Practice  and  Judicial 
 
Administration. If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving 
 
pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review 
 
 
Florida  Rule  of  General  Practice  and  Judicial  Administration  2.516.  You  may  find  this  rule  at

REQUIRED TO DO SO. If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by email, 
 
 
the procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
  
 
To serve and receive documents by e-mail, you must designate your e-mail addresses by using the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
 
Form 12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
