When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

This form should be used when one parent who is a servicemember is being deployed and the 
 
 
parties  wish to  temporarily  establish  or change  the custodial  responsibility,  parenting  plan,  or 
 
time-sharing schedule. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A servicemember is a member of the uniformed services and includes: 
 

 

 
•  Active and reserve components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or the Coast 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Guard of the United States; 
 

 
•  The United States Merchant Marine; 
 
 
•  The commissioned corps of the United States Public Health Service; 
 
 
•  The commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; 
 
 
•  The National Guard of a state or territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, or the District 
 

 

 

 

 

 

of Columbia. 
 

 

 

Deployment means the movement or mobilization of a servicemember for less than 18 months 
pursuant to uniformed service orders that: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  Are designated as unaccompanied; 
 
 
•  Do not authorize dependent travel; or 
 
 
•  Otherwise do not permit the movement of family members to the location to which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 
service member is deployed. 

 

 

 

Custodial responsibility includes all the powers and duties relating to caretaking authority and 
 
decisionmaking  authority  for  a  child.  It  includes  physical  custody,  legal  custody,  parental 
 
responsibility,  parenting  time,  right  to  access,  time-sharing,  visitation,  and  authority  to  grant 
 
limited contact with a child. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Caretaking authority means the right to live with and care for a child on a day-to-day basis. The 
 
 
 
term includes physical custody, parenting time, right to access, time-sharing, and visitation. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Decisionmaking  authority  means  the  power  to  make  important  decisions  regarding  a  child’s 
 
education, religious training, health care, extracurricular activities, and travel. The term does not 
 
include the power to make decisions that necessarily accompany a grant of caretaking authority. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Limited contact means the authority of a Nonparent to visit a child for a limited time. The term 
 
 
includes authority to take the child to a place other than the child’s residence. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.948(a), Agreement Granting 
Temporary Custodial Responsibility During Deployment (07/20) 
 
 

 

This agreement is temporary and automatically terminates 30 days after the Deploying Parent 
 
 
gives  notice  of  his/her  return  from  deployment  to  the  Other  Parent,  unless  the  parties  agree 
 
 
otherwise in writing or in a record, or the agreement has been terminated by court order. 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A Nonparent who is an adult family member of the child or a non-family member with whom the 
 
child has a close and substantial relationship may be granted temporary caretaking authority, 
 
decisionmaking authority, and/or limited contact.  A close and substantial relationship means a 
 
positive relationship of substantial duration and depth in which a significant emotional bond exists 
 
 
 
between a child and a Nonparent. 
 

 
 
   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Agreement Granting Temporary Custodial Responsibility During Deployment must: 
 

 

 

 
•  To  the  extent  permissible,  identify  the  destination,  duration,  and  conditions  of  the

Specify  the  frequency,  duration,  and  means,  including  electronic  means,  by  which  the 
 
 
Deploying  Parent  will  have  contact  with  the  children,  any  role  to  be  played  by  the  Other 
 
 
Parent or agreed-upon Nonparent in facilitating the contact, and the allocation of costs of 
 
contact; 
 
Specify contact  between the  Deploying Parent and children during the time  the  Deploying 
 
 
 
Parent is on leave or is otherwise available; 
 
 
•  Acknowledge that the agreement does not modify any existing child support obligation and 
 
that  changing  the  terms  of  the  obligation  during  deployment  requires  modification  in  the 
appropriate court; 
 

 
•

Specify which parent is required to file the agreement with the court.

case.  The Agreement should be as detailed as possible to address the needs of the children. In 
 
developing the Agreement, you may wish to consult or review other materials which are available

What should I do next? 
 

 

 

This form should be typed or printed in black ink. You must fill in all sections of the form. After 
 
completing the form, you should sign the form before a notary public or deputy clerk. A military 
 
member may sign before an officer authorized to administer oaths. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

For  your  case  to  proceed,  you  must  properly  notify  the  court  by  filing  the  original  of  the 
 
 
Agreement  and  a  Motion  for  Temporary  Order  Granting  Custodial  Responsibility  During 
 
Deployment, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form, 12.948(b), with the clerk of the 
 
circuit court.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court and keep a copy for 
 
your records.  The Motion must be filed in a pending proceeding for custodial responsibility or an 
 
existing case if you have one. The caption and case number must be on the agreement. If there is 
 
not  a  pending  proceeding,  the  motion  must  be  filed  in  a  new  action.  The  court  must  have 
 
jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. Each party to the 
 
agreement and any nonparent exercising caretaking authority must sign the agreement with their 
 
complete  street  address,  (Post  Office  Box  is  not  acceptable  except  for  deployed  members), 
 
telephone number, and e-mail address if available. Use of an e-mail address is encouraged.

staff or the judicial assistant to set a hearing.  You must notify the other party(ies) of the hearing 
 
by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, 
 
or other appropriate notice of hearing form. If the Motion for Temporary Order Granting Custodial 
 
Responsibility During Deployment is filed before the deploying parent deploys, you may request 
 
an expedited hearing. The court will then enter an order after the hearing.

provide their complete name, physical street address, telephone number, and e-mail if they have

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
