      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
  

 

 

        

 
PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME (ADULT) 
  

FORM 12.982(a) 
 

                   

(02/18) 
 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 
This form should be used when an adult wants the court to change his or her name.  This form is not to 
 
be used in connection with a dissolution of marriage or for adoption of child(ren).  If you want a change 
of name because of a dissolution of marriage or adoption of child(ren) that is not yet final, the change 
 
of name should be requested as part of that case. 
 
 
 
This form should be typed or printed in black ink and must be signed before a notary public or deputy 
 
clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in the county where you live and 
  
keep a copy for your records. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 
 

 
   
 

What should I do next? 
 
 
 
 
Unless you are seeking to restore a former name, you must have fingerprints submitted for a state and 
 
national criminal records check.  The fingerprints must be taken in a manner approved by the Department 
 
of Law Enforcement and must be submitted to the Department for a state and national criminal records 
 
check.  You may not request a hearing on the petition until the clerk of court has received the results of 
 
your criminal history records check.  The clerk of court can instruct you on the process for having the 
 
fingerprints taken and submitted, including information on law enforcement agencies or service providers 
 
 
authorized to submit fingerprints electronically to the Department of Law Enforcement.  The process may 
 
take several weeks and you will have to pay for the cost of processing the fingerprints and conducting the 
 
   
state  and  national  criminal  history  records  check.  Please  note  that  the  state  and  national  criminal 
 
records check must indicate whether you have registered as a sexual predator or a sexual offender and 
 
 
you must also indicate on this petition whether you have ever been required to register as a sexual 
 
predator under section 775.21, Florida Statutes, or as a sexual offender under section 943.0435, F.S. 
 
 
 
Next, you must obtain a hearing date for the court to consider your request. If you are seeking to restore 
 
a former name, a hearing on the petition MAY be held immediately after the petition is filed.  The final 
 
 
hearing on any other petition for a name change may be held immediately after the clerk of court receives 
 
the results of your criminal history records check. You should ask the clerk of court, family law intake 
 
staff, or judicial assistant about the local procedure for setting a hearing.  You may be required to attend 
 
the final hearing.  Included in these forms is a Final Judgment of Change of Name (Adult), Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.982(b), which the judge may use. You should contact the clerk, family 
 
law intake staff, or judicial assistant, to see if you need to bring a final judgment form with you. If so, you 
should type or print  the  heading, including the circuit, county, case  number, division, and the  parties’ 
 
 
names, and leave the rest blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial. 
 
 
 
If the judge grants your petition, he or she will sign this order.  This officially changes your name.  The 
 
clerk can provide you with certified copies of the signed order.  There will be charges for the certified

Where can I look for more information? 
 

 

 
 
Before proceeding, you should read General Information for Self-Represented Litigants found at the 
 
beginning of these forms.  For further information, see Section 68.07, Florida Statutes. 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration ow require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose to file 
 
 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
 
 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial 
 
Administration. 
If  you  elect  to  participate  in  electronic  service,  which  means  serving  or  receiving 
 
   
pleadings by electronic mail (e-mail), or through the Florida Courts E-Filing Portal, you must review Florida 
 
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link to the 
 
 
Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules of Court 
 
in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
 
 
12.915, and you must provide your e-mail address on each form on which your signature appears. Please 
 
CAREFULLY read the rules and instructions for: Certificate of Service (General), Florida Supreme Court 
Approved Family Law Form 12.914; Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.915; and Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.

Special notes... 
 
 
 
The heading of the form calls for the name of the petitioner.  Your current name should go there, as you 
 
are the one who is asking the court for something.  The judicial circuit, case number, and division may be 
 
obtained from the clerk of court’s office when you file the petition. 
 
 
It may be helpful to compile a list of all of the people and/or places that will need a copy of your final 
judgment.  This list may include the driver’s license office, social security office, banks, schools, etc.  A list 
 
 
 
will  help  you  know  how  many  copies  of  your  order  you  should  get  from  the  clerk  of  court  after your 
 
hearing. 
 
 
Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps you fill out these 
 
forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida Family Law Rules of 
 
Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill out these forms also 
 
must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the last page of every form 
he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
