      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORIDA SUPREME COURT APPROVED FAMILY LAW 
 
FORM 12.981(b)(1), 
 
JOINT PETITION FOR ADOPTION BY STEPPARENT (11/15) 
 

 

 

 

 

When should this form be used? 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 
This form should be used when a stepparent is adopting his or her spouse’s child.  Both the stepparent 
 
 
 
You  must  attach  all  necessary  consents  or 
and  his  or  her  spouse  must  sign  this  petition. 
 
acknowledgments  that  apply  to  your  case,  as  listed  under  the  Special  Notes  section  below.  Florida 
 
Statutes require that consent to adoption be obtained from: 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
The minor was conceived or born while the father was married to the mother; 
 
The minor is his child by adoption; 
 
The minor has been established by a court proceeding to be his child; 
 
He has filed an affidavit of paternity pursuant to section 382.013(2)(c) Florida Statutes; 
 
or 
 
In the case of an unmarried biological father, he has acknowledged in writing, signed in 
the presence of a competent witness, that he is the father of the minor, has filed such 
 
acknowledgment with the Office of Vital Statistics of the Department of Health within 
 
the required timeframes, and has complied with the requirements of section 63.062(2), 
 
Florida Statutes.

5. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 

Determining  whether  someone’s  consent  is  required,  or  when  consent  may  not  be  required  is  a 
 
 
 
complicated issue and you may wish to consult an attorney.  For more information about consenting to 
 
adoption, you should referto Chapter 63, Florida Statutes, and sections 63.062-63.082 in particular. 
 
 
 
This  form  should  be  typed  or  printed  in  black  ink.  The  name  to  be  given  to  the  child(ren)  after  the 
 
adoption should be used in the heading of the petition.  The stepparent is the petitioner, because he or 
 
she is the one who is asking the court for legal action.  After completing this form, you and your spouse 
 
 
must sign it before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should then file the original and 1 copy with the 
 
clerk of the circuit court in the county where the minor resides unless the court changes the venue. 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
The Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
 
filed  electronically  except  in  certain  circumstances.  Self-represented  litigants  may  file  petitions  or 
 
other pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so.  If you choose 
 
to  file  your  pleadings  or  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
For your case to proceed, you must have the written consent of the other birth parent and the child, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What should I do next? 
 

 
 
Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.981(b)(1), Joint Petition for 
 
Adoption by Stepparent (11/15) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
  The mother of the minor. 
 
 
 
  The father of the minor if: 
 

   
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

applicable.  The court may choose not to require consent to an adoption in some circumstances.  For 
 
more  information  about  situations  where  consent  may  not  be  required,  see  section  63.064,  Florida 
 
 
Statutes.  If you are attempting to proceed without the consent of the other birth parent, you may wish 
 
to consult with an attorney.  Section 63.054, Florida Statutes, requires that in each adoption proceeding, 
the  Florida  Putative  Father  Registry  be  searched.  You  will  need  an  order  from  the  judge  to  do  this, 
 
   
which you can request by filing a  Motion for Search of the Putative Father Registry,  Florida Supreme 
 
 
 
Court Approved Family Law Form 12.981(a)(6). 
 
 
 
 
When you have filed all of the required forms and met the requirements as outlined above, you are ready 
 
to set a hearing on your petition.  You should check with the clerk of court, family law intake staff or 
 
the judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  If all persons required to consent have consented and the 
 
consents/affidavits of nonpaternity have been filed with the court, the hearing may be held immediately. 
 
If not, notice of the hearing must be given as provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Form 1.902, 
 
Florida Rules of Civil Procedure.  If you know where the other birth parent lives, you should use personal 
 
service. If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may use constructive service.  In order 
 
to  use  constructive  service  you  will  need  to  complete  and  submit  to  the  court  Stepparent  Adoption: 
 
Affidavit of Diligent Search, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.981(a)(4).  For more 
information about personal and constructive service, you should refer to the “General Instructions for 
 
 
 
Self-Represented Litigants” found at the beginning of these forms and the instructions to Florida Family 
 
 
 
Law Rules of Procedure Forms 12.910(a) and 12.913(b) and Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law 
 
Form 12.913(a).  However, the law regarding constructive service is very complex and you may wish to 
 
consult an attorney regarding that issue.

After  the  initial  service  of  process  of  the  petition  or  supplemental  petition  by  the  Sheriff  or  certified 
 
process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
circumstances.  You  must  strictly  comply  with  the  format  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Rules  of 
 
 
Judicial Administration.  If you elect to participate in electronic service, which means serving or receiving 
 
pleadings  by  electronic  mail  (e-mail),  or  through  the  Florida  Courts  E-Filing  Portal,  you  must  review 
 
Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.  You may find this rule at www.flcourts.org through the link 
 
to the Rules of Judicial Administration provided under either Family Law Forms: Getting Started, or Rules 
  
of Court in the A-Z Topical Index. 
 
 
SELF-REPRESENTED  LITIGANTS  MAY  SERVE  DOCUMENTS  BY  E-MAIL;  HOWEVER,  THEY  ARE  NOT 
 
REQUIRED TO DO SO.  If a self-represented litigant elects to serve and receive documents by e-mail, the 
 
procedures must always be followed once the initial election is made. 
 
To  serve  and  receive  documents  by  e-mail,  you  must  designate  your  e-mail  addresses  by  using  the 
Designation of Current Mailing and E-mail Address, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 
  
 
12.915,  and  you  must  provide  your  e-mail  address  on  each  form  on  which  your  signature  appears.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
