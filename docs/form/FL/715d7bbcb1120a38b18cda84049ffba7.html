hat is a Guardian Advocate?     

Parents no longer have the legal authority to make decisions for their children after they 
turn 18 years of age.  Guardian Advocacy is a process for family members, caregivers, or friends of 
individuals with a developmental disability to obtain the legal authority to act on their behalf if the 
person  lacks  the  decision  making  ability  to  do  some,  but  not  all  of  the  decision  making  tasks 
necessary to care for his or her person or property. This is accomplished without having to declare 
the person with a developmental disability incapacitated. Guardian Advocate appointments are 
governed by Florida Statute Section 393.12.

Who is developmentally disabled?     

Under  the  Florida  Statute  Section  393.063(9),  a  person  with  a  developmental  disability 
must have mental retardation, cerebral palsy, autism, spina bifida, or Prader-Willi syndrome that 
manifested before the age of 18, and constitutes a substantial handicap that can be expected to 
continue for the rest of the person’s life.  The person with the developmental disability for whom 
a Guardian Advocate has been appointed is known as the “Ward.”    

What are the powers and duties of a Guardian Advocate?   

A  Guardian  Advocate  for  a  person  with  a  developmental  disability  shall  have  the  same 
powers, duties, and responsibilities required of a guardian under Florida Statute Chapter 744 and 
those defined by the judge.     

Do I need an attorney to become a Guardian Advocate?   

The process of becoming a Guardian Advocate of a person with developmental disabilities 
does not require the hiring of an attorney.  During the Guardian Advocacy proceedings, the Court 
will appoint an attorney for the person with a developmental disability to ensure that his or her 
best interest is protected.     

If there is property involved, other than social security benefits or other government payee 
programs,  the  person  seeking  to become  a  Guardian  Advocate  of  the  person  and the  property 
must hire an attorney.  These property rights include, but are not limited to a pending lawsuit, 
estate  matter,  or  other  income  or  property  right  coming  to  the  person  with  a  developmental 
disability.  The Court can expand the description of property rights by Petition and Order.    

   

   

   

   

Who may serve as a Guardian Advocate?   

Any resident of the State of Florida who is 18 years old and of sound mind is qualified to 

act as Guardian Advocate. In addition, a non-resident may serve if he or she is related to the 
Ward by blood, adoption or law according to Florida Statute Section 744.309(2).    

The court may appoint any person whom it considers fit, proper, and qualified to act as 
guardian whether or not related to the ward. However, the court gives preference to a person 
who:   

• 

Is related by blood or marriage to the person with the developmental disability;   

•  Has relevant educational, professional or business experience;   

•  Has the capacity to manage the finances involved; or   

•  Has the ability to meet the requirements of the law and the unique needs of the individual.    
The court shall also consider the wishes expressed by a developmentally disabled person as to 

who shall be appointed guardian.

Who may NOT serve as a Guardian Advocate?   

No  person  who  has  been  convicted  of  a  felony  can  be  appointed  to  act  as  Guardian 
Advocate. Furthermore, no person who has been judicially determined to have committed abuse, 
abandonment,  or  neglect  against  a  child  as  defined  in  Florida  Statutes  Sections  39.01  and 
984.03(1), (2), and (37), or who has been found guilty of, regardless of adjudication, or entered a 
plea of no contest under any similar statute of another jurisdiction can be appointed to act as a 
Guardian Advocate.    

Additionally,  a  person  who  provides  substantial  services  to  the  proposed  ward  in  a 
professional or business capacity, or is a creditor of the proposed ward, may not be appointed 
Guardian Advocate and retain that previous professional or business relationship. A person may 
not  be  appointed  as  Guardian  Advocate  if  he  or  she  is  an  employee  of  any  person,  agency, 
government,  or  corporation  that  provides  service  to  the  proposed  ward  in  a  professional  or 
business capacity, except that a person so employed may be appointed if he or she is the spouse, 
adult  child, parent,  or  sibling  of  the proposed  ward  or the  court  determines  that the  potential 
conflict  of  interest  is  insubstantial  and  that  the  appointment  would  clearly  be  in  the  proposed 
ward's best interest.   

A  provider  of  health  care  services  to  the  ward,  whether  direct  or  indirect,  may  not  be 
appointed  the  Guardian  of  the  ward,  unless  the  court  specifically  finds  there  is  no  conflict  of 
interest with the ward’s best interest.   

   

Do I have to submit to a background investigation?    

Florida  Statute  Section  744.3135  shall  require  non-professional  Guardian  Advocates  to 
agree  to  a  background  investigation  of  the  Guardian  Advocate’s  credit  history  and  to  a  level 2 
background screening at their own expense.   

The Guardian Advocate must call a live scan service provider to schedule an appointment 
to  undergo  the  finger  printing  process.  The  cost  will  vary  from  provider  to  provider,  so  the 
Guardian Advocate should ask each provider about the cost involved. The background screening 
results  must  be  received  from the  Florida Department  of  Law  Enforcement  (FDLE)  and  Federal 
Bureau of Investigation to the ORI (FL036023Z). Please remember the background check must be 
completed before a hearing for appointment as Guardian Advocate can be scheduled.  
   
Will I be required to receive instruction or training?   
According  to  Florida  Statutes  Section  393.12(10)  and  Section  744.3145,  each  person 
   
appointed to be a Guardian Advocate must complete the required number of hours of instruction 
and  education  within  4  months  after  his  or  her  appointment.  The  training  must  be  completed 
through a course approved by the chief judge of the circuit court and taught by a court-approved 
organization.  Court-approved  organizations  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  community  or 
junior colleges, guardianship organizations, and the local bar association or The Florida Bar.    

Expenses incurred by the Guardian Advocate to satisfy the education requirement may be 
paid from the ward's estate, unless the court directs that such expenses be paid by the Guardian 
Advocate individually.    

Page 4 of 7   

The court may, at its discretion, waive some or all of the training requirements or impose 
additional requirements. The court will make its decision on a case-by-case basis considering the 
experience  and  education  of  the  Guardian  Advocate,  the  duties  assigned  to  the  Guardian 
Advocate, and the needs of the ward.   

   

   

Will I be required to file reports to the court regarding the person with 
the developmental disabilities?   

A Guardian Advocate must file an Initial  Guardianship Plan and those with property use 
Initial Inventory within 60 days of appointment pursuant to Florida Statute Section 744.361 and 
744.362. The initial report must include a statement of medical, mental, or personal care services 
of the ward, and a statement of the place and kind of residential setting best suited for the needs 
of the ward. In addition, the Initial Report includes all physical and mental examinations necessary 
to determine the ward’s medical and mental health treatment needs.    

In addition, a Guardian Advocate must file a report each year. The Annual Guardianship 
Plan  of  Guardian  –  Guardian  Advocate  of  the  Person  must  be  filed  within  90  days  from  the

include  information  concerning  the  residence  of  the  ward,  the  medical  and  mental  health 
conditions, treatment and rehabilitation needs of the ward, and the social condition of the ward.
