FORM 12.901(b)(2) 
PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE WITH PROPERTY BUT NO 
DEPENDENT OR MINOR CHILD(REN) 
(02/18) 

When should this form be used? 

his form may be used when you are  filing for a dissolution of marriage, and you and your  spouse  have 
marital assets and/or marital liabilities, but you  do not have any minor or dependent children and neither 
of you is  pregnant.  You or your spouse must have lived in Florida for at least 6 months before filing for a 
dissolution in Florida.  If you and your spouse agree on all issues and both can attend the hearing, you 
may want to file a Petition for Simplified Dissolution of Marriage, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 
Form 12.901(a); however, you cannot file a Petition for a Simplified Dissolution of Marriage if any of the 
following are true: 
 

  You disagree about property, debts, or other matters and wish to have a judge settle them for 

  Either you or your spouse is seeking spousal support (alimony). 
  You would like to ask questions and get documents concerning your spouse’s income, expenses, 

assets, debts, or other matters before having a trial or settlement. 

  You  would  like  to  reserve  your  rights  to  have  any matters  reconsidered  or  appeal  the  judge’s 

you. 

decision. 

his form should be typed or printed in black ink.  After completing this form, you should sign the form 
before a notary public or deputy clerk.  You should file the original with the clerk of the circuit court in 
the county where you live and keep a copy for your records.  Because you are filing the petition in this 
proceeding, you may also be referred to as the petitioner and your spouse as the respondent. 
 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING E-FILING 

he Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all petitions, pleadings, and documents be 
filed electronically except in certain circumstances. Self-represented litigants may file petitions or other 
pleadings or documents electronically; however, they are not required to do so. If you choose to file 
your  pleadings  or  other  documents  electronically,  you  must  do  so  in  accordance  with  Florida  Rule  of 
Judicial Administration 2.525, and you must follow the procedures of the judicial circuit in which you file. 
The rules and procedures should be carefully read and followed. 
 

What should I do next? 
 
For your case to proceed, you must properly notify your spouse of the petition.  If you know where he or 
she lives, you should use personal service.  If you absolutely do not know where he or she lives, you may 
use constructive service. You may also be able to use constructive service if your spouse resides in another 
state or country; however, if constructive service is used, other than granting a divorce, the court may 
only  grant  limited  relief  which  cannot  include  spousal  support  (alimony).    For  more  information  on 
constructive service, see Notice of Action for Dissolution of Marriage (No Child or Financial Support), 
Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.913(a)(1),  and  Affidavit  of  Diligent  Search  and 

Instructions for Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.901(b)(2), Petition for Dissolution 
of Marriage with Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (02/18)

Inquiry, Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b).  If your spouse is in the military service of 
the  United  States,  additional  steps  for  service  may  be  required.    See,  for  example,  Memorandum  for 
Certificate of Military Service, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.912(a) and Affidavit 
of  Military  Service,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.912(b).  In  sum,  the  law 
regarding constructive service and service on an individual in the military service is very complex and you 
may wish to consult an attorney regarding these issues. 

f personal service is used, your spouse has 20 days to answer after being served with your petition.  Your 
case will then generally proceed in one of the following three ways: 

EFAULT.  If after 20 days, your spouse has not filed an answer, you may file a Motion for Default, Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.922(a), with the clerk of court.  Then, if you have filed all 
of the required papers, you may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a 
final hearing.  You must notify your spouse of the hearing by using a Notice of Hearing (General), Florida 
Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

NCONTESTED. If your spouse files an answer that agrees with everything in your petition or an answer 
and waiver, and you have complied with mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers, you 
may contact the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to set a final hearing.  You must notify 
your  spouse  of  the  hearing  by  using  a  Notice  of  Hearing  (General),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved 
Family Law Form 12.923, or other appropriate notice of hearing form. 

ONTESTED.  If your spouse files an answer or an answer and counterpetition, which disagrees with or 
denies anything in your petition, and you are unable to settle the disputed issues, you should file a Notice 
for  Trial,  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form  12.924,  after  you  have  complied  with 
mandatory disclosure and filed all of the required papers.  Some circuits may require the completion of 
mediation  before a final hearing may be set.  You should contact the  clerk, family law intake  staff, or 
judicial assistant for instructions on how to set your case for trial (final hearing).  If your spouse files an 
answer and counterpetition, you should answer the counterpetition within 20 days using an Answer to 
Counterpetition, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.903(d). 
 

Where can I look for more information? 

efore proceeding, you should read “General Information for Self-Represented Litigants” found at the 
beginning of these forms.  The words that are in bold underline in these instructions are defined there.

process server, the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration now require that all documents required or 
permitted to be served on the other party must be served by electronic mail (e-mail) except in certain 
circumstances. You must strictly comply with the format requirements set forth in the Rules of Judicial

arital/Nonmarital Assets and Liabilities. Florida law requires an equitable distribution of marital assets 
and marital liabilities.  “Equitable” does not necessarily mean “equal.”  Many factors, including alimony 
awards, may lead the court to make an unequal (but still equitable) distribution of assets and liabilities.  
Nonmarital assets and nonmarital liabilities are those assets and liabilities which the parties agree or the 
court determines belong to, or are the responsibility of, only one of the parties.  If the parties agree or the 
court finds an asset or liability to be nonmarital, the judge will not consider it when distributing marital 
assets and liabilities. 

emporary  Relief.  If  you  need  temporary  relief  regarding  temporary  use  of  assets,  temporary 
responsibility for liabilities, or temporary alimony, you may file a Motion for Temporary Support with No 
Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.947(c).  For more 
information, see the instructions for that form. 

arital Settlement Agreement. If you and your spouse are able to reach an agreement on any or all of 
the issues, you should file a Marital Settlement Agreement for Dissolution of Marriage with Property 
But No Dependent or Minor Child(ren), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(f)(2).  
Both spouses must sign this agreement before a notary public or deputy clerk.  Any issues on which you 
are unable to agree will be considered contested and settled by the judge at the final hearing. 

inal Judgment Forms. These family law forms contain a Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage with 
Property  but  No  Dependent  or  Minor  Child(ren),  Florida  Supreme  Court  Approved  Family  Law  Form 
12.990(c)(2),  which  the  judge  may  use  if  your  case  is  contested.  If  you  and  your  spouse  reach  an 
agreement  on  all  of  the  issues,  the  judge  may  use  a  Final  Judgment  of  Dissolution  of  Marriage  with 
Property but No Dependent or Minor Child(ren) (Uncontested), Florida Supreme Court Approved Family 
Law Form 12.990(b)(2).  You should check with the clerk, family law intake staff, or judicial assistant to 
see if you need to bring a final judgment with you to the hearing.  If so, you should type or print  the 
heading, including the circuit, county, case number, division, and the parties’ names, and leave the rest 
blank for the judge to complete at your hearing or trial. 

onlawyer.  Remember, a person who is NOT an attorney is called a nonlawyer. If a nonlawyer helps 

you fill out these forms, that person must give you a copy of a Disclosure from Nonlawyer, Florida 
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900 (a), before he or she helps you.  A nonlawyer helping you fill 
out these forms also must put his or her name, address, and telephone number on the bottom of the 
last page of every form he or she helps you complete.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
