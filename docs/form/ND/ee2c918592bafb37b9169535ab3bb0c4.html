SECTION ONE: INFORMATION ABOUT EVICTION IN NORTH DAKOTA 

What is an Eviction? 

In North Dakota, a landlord may evict a tenant for one or more of the eight grounds (reasons) 
for eviction allowed by North Dakota law.   

Eviction is an accelerated, or sped up, civil legal action to determine the right to possess the 
property.  North Dakota eviction law strictly limits the ability to combine eviction with other 
claims related to the lease agreement. 

What are the Eight Grounds (Reasons) for Eviction? 

A landlord may evict a tenant for one or more of the eight grounds (reasons) for eviction.  
(North Dakota Century Code Section 47-32-01)  The most common grounds are bolded. 

The eight grounds (reasons) for eviction are: 

1. A party, by force, intimidation, fraud, or stealth, has entered upon the prior actual

possession of real property of another and detains the same.

2. A party, after peaceably entering upon real property, turns out by force, threats, or

menacing conduct the party in possession.

3. A party, by force or by menaces and threats of violence, unlawfully holds and keeps the
possession of any real property, whether the possession was acquired peaceably or
otherwise.

4. A lessee, in person or by subtenant, holds over after the termination of the lease or

expiration of the lessee's term, or fails to pay rent for three days after the rent is due.

5. A party continues in possession after a sale of the real property under mortgage,

execution, order, or any judicial process and after the expiration of the time fixed by law
for redemption, or after the execution and delivery of a deed, or after the cancellation
and termination of any contract for deed, bond for deed, or other instrument for the
future conveyance of real estate or equity in the real estate.

6. A party continues wrongfully in possession after a judgment in partition or after a sale

under an order or decree of a district court.

7. A lessee or a person on the premises with the lessee's consent acts in a manner that

unreasonably disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises.

8. The lessee violates a material term of the written lease agreement between the lessor

and lessee.

*CAUTION*Repairs and Non-Payment of Rent 

Tenants must pay the rent on time according to their verbal or written lease.  There’s no 
defense for non-payment of rent, even when repairs became necessary and the landlord didn’t 
make the repairs in a reasonable amount of time. 

However, if a ground (reason) for the eviction is non-payment of rent and the tenant made the 
repairs and deducted the amount from the rent, the tenant may challenge the amount of rent 
the landlord claims is past due. 

Who are the Parties in an Eviction? 

Plaintiff – The person who leased the property to another; a landlord. 

If the property is owned by an individual, the Plaintiff is the individual.  If the property is owned 
by a legal entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company, the Plaintiff is the legal 
entity.  (See Page 15 for when a lawyer must represent a Plaintiff in an eviction action.) 

Defendant – The person who rents or holds the lease to a property; a tenant. 

What are the Definitions of Some Commonly Used Terms in an Eviction? 

Attorney’s Fees – the amount an attorney charges a client to represent them in a court case. 
Attorney’s fees may be awarded as costs to a successful plaintiff if there is an enforceable 
agreement between the plaintiff and defendant.  Written leases sometimes include an 
agreement that, if evicted, the tenant will pay attorney’s fees.  (See also, Costs.) 

Complaint – an eviction complaint is a written, legal document that is served with the eviction 
summons.  The complaint states the grounds (reasons) for the eviction, the basic facts of the 
eviction, and identifies the action the landlord is asking the court to take. 

Costs – generally refers to expenses and fees for going to court.  For example, costs may include 
filing fees, charges for serving legal documents, and making copies of papers and exhibits.  If 
the court orders the eviction, the plaintiff is usually awarded costs.  (See also, Attorney’s Fees.) 

Damages – money paid by defendants to successful plaintiffs in civil cases to compensate the 
plaintiffs for their injuries.  In an eviction, damages are limited to rents or profits that are past 
due, and damages caused by the tenant’s possession of the property.  Landlords can’t request 
an award of future rent when bringing an eviction. 

Forcible Detainer – a civil, legal process that is used to evict a tenant in North Dakota.  It is an 
accelerated, or sped up, civil legal action to determine the right to possess the property.  

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 5 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

Lease – a contract by which one gives to another the temporary possession and use of real 
property for reward and the latter agrees to return such possession to the former at a future 
time. 

Lessor – the person who leases a property to another; a landlord. 

Lessee – the person who rents or holds the lease to a property; a tenant. 

Lien – a right given to another by the owner of specific property to secure a debt, or one 
created by law in favor of certain creditors. 

Real Property – real or immovable land including anything that is affixed to the land that is 
incidental or immovable by law. 

Personal Property – anything that isn’t real property. 

Summons – an eviction summons is a written, legal notice that comes with the eviction 
complaint.  The summons notifies the tenant that an eviction action has been filed with the 
District Court, and includes the date, time and location of the eviction hearing. 

Writ of Execution – an order from the Judge or Judicial Referee needed to give possession of 
the property back to the landlord.  (The writ may also be referred to as a Writ of Execution for 
Possession, a Writ of Restitution, or a Writ of Eviction.)  A writ of execution can’t be issued until 
after the court orders an eviction.

interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rules and rulings, and case law (court decisions).  Notes of case law (court 
decisions) related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are found in many North 
Dakota public and academic libraries.

you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

part of the case the attorney handled.  For example: 

You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your
legal rights and responsibilities;

You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend
hearings yourself;

You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an
attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy;

You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make court
appearances for you.

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

rent in the 3 day notice of intention to evict, or included rent that isn’t due, this may become a 
defense in your eviction. 

Late Fees: if your lease says that as additional rent you pay a late fee if the rent is paid late, the 
late fees may be included in the 3-day notice of intention to evict. 

If a ground (reason) for eviction includes failure to pay the rent for three days after rent is due, 
the 3 day notice of intention to evict must provide the opportunity for the tenant to pay the 
past-due rent before the end of the 3 day deadline. 

When can a 3 day notice of intention to evict be served (delivered) to a tenant: 

Failure to pay rent: When ground (reason) four, failure to pay rent, applies, the 3-day notice can 
be served after the rent is three days past the due date.  A landlord must wait until after you’re 
three days late with the rent.

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

Violation of material term of written lease agreement: When ground (reason) eight applies, the 
3-day notice can be served after you violate a material term of the written lease.

How is a 3-day notice of intention to evict served (delivered): 

When the tenant can be found, there are two ways the landlord can arrange for service of the 
notice of intention to evict to you. 

•

Personal Service by a Sheriff:

A landlord may arrange for the sheriff of the county to personally serve the 3-day notice
of intention to evict to you.

In other words, the 3-day notice of intention to evict is personally delivered by the
sheriff of the county to you or a person of suitable age and discretion in your household.

•

Personal Service by a Person 18 years or older:

A landlord may arrange for person who is at least 18 years of age and not a party to or
interested in the eviction action to personally serve the 3-day notice of intention to evict
to you.

In other words, the 3-day notice of intention to evict is personally delivered by a person
who is at least 18 years of age and not a party to or interested in the case to you or a
person of suitable age and discretion in the your household.

At least one attempt must be made to serve the 3-day notice of intention to evict on you using 
either of the two methods above.  An attempt must be made between the hours of six p.m. and 
ten p.m. 

When a tenant CAN’T be found, and after at least one attempt to serve the 3-day notice of 
intention to evict using either of the two methods above, the sheriff of the county or a process 
server may post the notice in a conspicuous place at the leased premises, i.e., tape it to the 
front door.  

IMPORTANT! Incorrect service of the 3-day notice of intention to evict doesn’t automatically 
stop the eviction process.  However, you may dispute service of the notice with your landlord.  
If the landlord continues the eviction process, you may present your side to the court at your 
eviction hearing.   (See “If the tenant disputes the 3-day notice of intention to evict” below.) 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 12 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

Calculating the deadline of a 3 day notice of intention to evict: 

Review Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully!  When a law doesn’t 
specifically say how to calculate time, Rule 6 applies. 

When calculating days: 

• Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period;
• Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and
•

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday.

If you dispute the deadline in a 3 day notice of intention to evict, notify your landlord.  If the 
landlord continues the eviction process, you may present your side to the court at your eviction 
hearing.   (See “If the tenant disputes the 3-day notice of intention to evict” below.) 

Tenant payments during the 3-day notice of intention to evict period: 

Full payment of rent and late fees: 

If the reason for the 3-day notice of intention to evict is non-payment or late payment of rent, 
you may pay the full amount of rent and late fees, if any, within the 3-day notice deadline. 

If you pay the full amount listed within the 3-day notice of intention to evict deadline, and the 
landlord accepts your payment, the landlord can’t continue with the eviction process to evict 
you for non-payment or late payment of rent.  

Partial payment of rent and late fees: 

If you attempt to make a partial payment, the landlord doesn’t have to accept it.  Some 
landlords may agree to accept partial payments or a payment plan for the outstanding amount 
(per a written agreement). 

If the tenant disputes the 3-day notice of intention to evict: 

Don’t delay!  If you dispute the information in the 3-day notice of intention to evict, inform the 
landlord in writing.  Be specific. 

For example: 

• A landlord must wait until you’re late with the rent. If there is a written lease, consult

the lease to verify the due date of the rent.

• Repair expenses made by you may be deducted from the rent in certain circumstances.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 13 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

• A landlord can’t include any other amounts, i.e. utilities, or other costs (unless these

•

items are included in the rent amount).
The notice of intention to evict was not served correctly.  (See “How is a 3-day notice of
intention to evict served (delivered)” above.)

Make a copy of the letter for your records.  Deliver the letter to the landlord in a way that 
shows actual delivery.   

By having a copy of the letter and proof of delivery, if the landlord moves forward with the 
eviction you can bring this documentation with you to the court hearing. 

Begin gathering documentation: 

If the landlord moves forward with the eviction (see Step Two) you’ll need to prepare to 
present your side of the eviction to the North Dakota State District Court.  Begin preparing by 
gathering documentation that you believe will prove your side. 

For example: 

The lease agreement (original and renewals).

•
• Documentation of your rent payments.
•
•

List of witnesses.
If you dispute the amount of past-due rent due to repair expenses:
o Receipts for work and material if you made repairs yourself.
o Records of apartment and building problems, including problems with heat, hot

water, and all other repairs and services.
o Photos – labeled by date and description.
o List of dates that you spoke with the landlord, maintenance, or building staff

about problems with your apartment/housing.

STEP TWO IN AN EVICTION: Service of Eviction Summons and Complaint 

What happens if a tenant doesn’t leave after receiving the 3-day notice of intention to evict? 

When you receive a 3-day notice of intention to evict and don’t comply, the landlord may start 
the North Dakota state district court eviction process.  The North Dakota state district court 
eviction process starts with service of the Eviction Summons and Complaint on the tenant. 

IMPORTANT!  The eviction process moves very quickly once the Eviction Summons and 
Complaint are served! 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 14 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

IMPORTANT! If the property is part of a legal entity, such as a business, a corporation or a 
limited liability company, the landlord CAN’T represent the legal entity in the eviction UNLESS 
the landlord is a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

ONLY a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota can represent a legal entity in an eviction.  
Non-lawyers aren’t allowed to represent legal entities in evictions.  

(See Wetzel v. Schlenvogt, 2005 ND 190; and State ex rel. Department of Labor v. Riemers, 2008 
ND 191.) 

A non-lawyer’s signature on an eviction summons and complaint may not automatically stop 
the eviction process.  At your eviction hearing, you may present evidence that the property is 
owned by a legal entity and a non-lawyer signed the eviction summons and complaint on behalf 
of the legal entity. 

The North Dakota Secretary of State website offers a registered business database.  The 
database is free to search by business name.  Go to sos.nd.gov/business/business-
services/business-records-search. 

Every lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota is searchable by name at 
www.ndcourts.gov/lawyers. 

What is an Eviction Summons? 

An Eviction Summons is a written, legal notice that comes with the Eviction Complaint.  The 
Eviction Summons notifies you, the defendant, that an eviction action has begun.   

The Eviction Summons contains the date, time and location of the eviction hearing in a North 
Dakota state district court.  You, the defendant, are required to appear in person at the eviction 
hearing and answer the complaint.  

An example of an Eviction Summons is found online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by 
clicking on the “Eviction for Landlords” link in the “Landlords and Tenants” section. 

What is an Eviction Complaint? 

An Eviction Complaint is a legal document that: 

•
•
•
•

Identifies the parties in the eviction – Plaintiff (Landlord) vs Defendant (Tenant);
States the grounds (reasons) for eviction;
States the basic facts of the eviction; and
Identifies the action the landlord is asking the court to take and any other relief the
landlord wants the court to grant.

NDLSHC Info Guide

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

The Eviction Complaint is served with the Eviction Summons. 

An example of an Eviction Complaint is found online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by 
clicking on the “Eviction for Landlords” link in the “Landlords and Tenants” section. 

 NOTE: If the property is part of a legal entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company, 
non-lawyers are generally not allowed to represent legal entities in a North Dakota state district 
court.  Court documents signed by non-lawyer agents of a legal entity may be considered void. 

How are an Eviction Summons and Complaint served (delivered)? 

There are two ways a landlord may arrange for service of a copy of the summons and complaint 
on you.  The timeline for service depends on the way the copy of the summons and complaint 
are served. 

•

In person service on the tenant(s).

The sheriff of the county may serve the Eviction Summons and Complaint personally on
you or a person of suitable age and discretion in your household.

A person who is at least 18 years of age and not a party to or interested in the eviction
action may serve the Eviction Summons and Complaint personally on you or a person of
suitable age and discretion in your household.

•

If the person can’t be found in the county, the following conditions apply to service:

o Proof that the sheriff or process server attempted service, and that service was

attempted at least once between the hours of six p.m. and ten p.m.

o An affidavit must be filed by the landlord or the landlord’s attorney that states:
The tenant can’t be found, or the tenant isn’t in this state.


 A copy of the eviction summons has been mailed to the tenant at the

tenant's last-known address if any is known to the landlord.
o Then, service of the Eviction Summons may be made upon you by the sheriff or
process server posting the summons upon the door of the residential unit.

•

Timelines for services of the summons and complaint on the tenant(s):

If the tenant was personally served a copy of the summons and complaint within the
county, service must be completed at least three days before the time set for the
eviction hearing.

Otherwise, service must be completed at least seven days before the time set for the
eviction hearing.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 16 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

IMPORTANT! Incorrect service of the summons and complaint doesn’t automatically stop the 
eviction process.  However, you may dispute service of the summons and complaint when you 
present your side to the court at your eviction hearing. 

A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide the Eviction: 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows eviction cases to be 
heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the eviction case, any party to the case may request that a 
District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

STEP THREE IN AN EVICTION: Prepare for the Eviction Hearing 

Circle and note the date of your eviction hearing  on your summons and complaint.  If you 

don’t attend the hearing, the Judge or Judicial Referee may rule against you and evict you. 

The Eviction Summons and Complaint includes the date, time and location of the eviction 
hearing.  The eviction hearing will be between three and fifteen calendar days from the date 
the Eviction Summons was issued. 

The eviction hearing is your only opportunity to tell the court your side of the eviction.  Even if 
you don’t dispute the grounds (reasons) for the eviction, you may ask the court to allow you up 
to 5 additional days to move out. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible. 

Review pre-trial or trial guidebooks for self-represented individuals and lawyers: 

Preparing for an eviction hearing is often a complex and confusing process.  Review pre-trial 
and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Your local public or academic 
library may have resources available. 

Continue gathering documentation: 

Since the landlord moved forward with the eviction, you’ll need to prepare to present your side 
of the eviction to the North Dakota State District Court at the eviction hearing.  If you received a 
3-day notice of intention to evict, you may have already begun to gather documentation.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 17 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

Continue preparing for the eviction hearing by gathering documentation that you believe will 
prove your side. 

For examples of documentation, see “Begin gathering documentation” in Section Two, above. 

Finish your eviction hearing preparations: 

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully!  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence 
govern whether your evidence is admitted at the hearing.  The Rules also govern how you 
object to evidence the landlord wants to admit at trial. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking on the 
"Evidence” link in the “District Court Civil” section. 

Review Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully!  If you require a witness 
to appear at the hearing or require production of documents, electronically stored information 
or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District Court to issue a subpoena.  Only a 
Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

A Subpoena Informational Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking on 
the "Subpoenas” link in the “District Court Civil” section. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Prepare a contingency plan: 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides in the landlord’s favor, you’ll be evicted the same day as 
the court hearing unless you claim hardship, in which case the Judge or Judicial Referee can give 
you up to five days to move out.  

This means that if your court date is Tuesday, October 19, 2017, the Judge or Judicial Referee 
may evict you on Tuesday, October 19, 2017. 

Before you go to the eviction hearing, prepare some contingency plans.  For example, find a 
relative to stay with or find an emergency homeless shelter.  You also need to have a plan for 
your belongings, such as a storage facility. 

The North Dakota homeless shelter directory is available at 
https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/northdakota.html 

*Warning*  Many of the shelters have waiting lists. Contact the shelter before going there.

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

STEP FOUR IN AN EVICTION: Attend the Eviction Hearing 

The eviction hearing is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the Judge or 
Judicial Referee.  The landlord and tenant each have an opportunity to tell their side of the facts 
of the eviction and argue how the eviction laws apply to the situation.  The Judge or Judicial 
Referee weighs the facts and arguments presented by the landlord and tenant and either grants 
or dismisses the eviction.  

The eviction hearing is your only opportunity to tell the court your side of the eviction.  Even if 
you don’t dispute the grounds (reasons) for the eviction, you may ask the court to allow you up 
to 5 days to move out. 

Contact information for Clerks of District Court by County: 

Contact information for Clerks of District Court by county is available at www.ndcourts.gov. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible. 

Don’t be late! 

Don’t be late for your eviction hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason why you can’t 
go to the eviction hearing on the scheduled day or will be late, call the Clerk of District Court’s 
office as soon as possible. 

Be aware that even if you contact the Clerk of District Court’s office, the Judge or Judicial 
Referee may decide to hold the eviction hearing without you. 

Bring the information, documents, etc. that you prepared for the hearing: 

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc. that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
eviction hearing.  Bring the outline of what you want to say. 

Conduct of the hearing: 

In general, an eviction hearing proceeds in the following order: 

Before the hearing officially begins: 

• Organize your files and paperwork on your assigned table in the courtroom so you can

easily locate information as needed.

Page 19 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

•

•

•

•

•

•

The landlord or the landlord’s attorney may give you copies of their documents before
the hearing starts.

The eviction hearing officially begins when all are asked to rise when the Judge or Judicial 
Referee comes into the courtroom: 

The Judge or Judicial Referee begins the eviction hearing by identifying any documents
that were submitted to the court clerk and identifying the names of the parties.

The landlord or the landlord’s attorney may give you copies of their documents, if
copies were not given to you before the hearing began.

Opening statements: 

• Often, each side gives an opening statement.  An opening statement describes the

issues in the eviction and states what the party expects to prove during the hearing.

• Usually, the plaintiff goes first and the defendant goes last.

The Plaintiff presents his or her case first: 

The landlord or, if represented, the landlord’s attorney presents the landlord’s case first.

Individuals with first-hand knowledge of the facts of the eviction, such as the landlord,
property manager, managing agent, or site manager, are called to testify as a witness.
Each witness sits in the stand and is sworn in.

The landlord or, if represented, the landlord’s attorney asks each witness questions to
present evidence of the facts of the eviction to the court.  For example:

o Who they are and how they know the tenant;
o The location of the property;
o Identification of the documents the plaintiff wants the court to allow as

evidence, such as: the lease and payment ledger;

o Rent amount, amount of rent owed; and
o Anything else that pertains to why the eviction action was brought.

If you object to the questions or evidence being presented, you may object when the
question is asked, or when evidence is presented.  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence
govern how you object to evidence.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 20 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

You have the option to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses: 

• After the landlord or, if represented, the landlord’s attorney finishes direct questioning
of a witness, you have a chance to ask the witness questions.  This is called cross-
examination.

You can only ask questions about the topics covered during the plaintiff’s direct
questioning of their witness.

If you don’t have any questions, the Judge or Judicial Referee will allow the witness to
go back to their seat.

You present your case: 

• After the landlord or, if represented, the landlord’s attorney finishes presenting their

case, you present the evidence of your side of the facts of the eviction.  You may testify
on your own behalf.

You may call individuals with first-hand knowledge of your side of the facts of the
eviction, to testify as your witness.  Each witness sits in the stand and is sworn in.

You ask each witness questions to present evidence of the facts of the eviction to the
court.  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern how you present evidence.

If the plaintiff objects to the questions or evidence you present, the plaintiff may object
when the question is asked, or when evidence is presented.

The Plaintiff has the option to cross-examine your witnesses: 

• After you finish direct questioning of your witness, the landlord or, if represented, the
landlord’s attorney has a chance to ask your witness questions.  This is called cross-
examination.

The plaintiff can only ask questions about the topics covered during your direct
questioning of your witness.

If the plaintiff doesn’t have any questions, the Judge or Judicial Referee will allow the
witness to go back to their seat.

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Closing arguments: 

• Often, each side gives a closing argument.  A closing argument is a summary of the

evidence presented at the hearing and an argument to the Judge or Judicial Referee on
how the case should be decided.

o Remember, you may request up to five (5) days to move out.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 21 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

• Usually, the plaintiff goes first and the defendant goes last.

The Judge or Judicial Referee will then either order the eviction or dismiss the case: 

•

•

•

The Judge or Judicial Referee gives a summary of the documents entered into evidence
and the testimony from everyone who testified.

If the Judge or Judicial Referee orders the eviction, you’ll be given a date of eviction.
You and all of your belongings must be moved out on that date.

o If the case is complicated, a Judge or Judicial Referee may decide to reserve

judgment. This means that the Judge or Judicial Referee will mail their decision
about the case.

The plaintiff can ask for a money judgment, which may include: outstanding rent, fees
associated with the service of notice of eviction and service of summons and complaint,
late charges, and attorney’s fees.

*Important*

Before you leave the courtroom:

 
Before you leave the courtroom, make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you’re 
not sure. 

 

Review of a Judicial Referee’s Findings and Order: 

If the eviction case is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will issue 
findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the same 
effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a written 
order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the eviction case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and 
order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for the 
review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to review. 

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

STEP FIVE IN AN EVICTION: After the Eviction Hearing 

If you’re evicted, you must move out by the date in the eviction order: 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee orders the eviction, the eviction order will state the date you 
must leave the property.  If you didn’t make contingency plans before the eviction hearing, you 
may wish to review the contingency plan information in Step Three of this informational guide. 

If you don’t move out before the date of eviction, the Writ of Execution goes into effect.  The 
Sheriff or the Sheriff’s staff will come and escort you off the premises.  

For example:  if your eviction hearing is Tuesday, November 28 and the Judge or Judicial 
Referee orders your eviction on Thursday, November 30, you have 2 days to move out.  If you 
don’t move out, law enforcement will come on Thursday, November 30, to escort you and your 
property from the premises. 

*Important*  Only the Sheriff or the Sheriff’s staff can evict you from the property! 

Tenant responsible for rent during the term of the lease: 

You’re still responsible for the remainder of your lease even if you’re evicted.  But, the landlord 
must make an effort to find someone to take over the rest of your lease. 

(See Section 47-16-13.7 of the North Dakota Century Code.) 

Security deposits: 

You may not receive your security deposit back. The Judge or Judicial Referee may apply this 
amount to any outstanding fees awarded to the landlord as part of the eviction. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee doesn’t apply the security deposit to outstanding fees awarded 
to the landlord as part of the eviction, the landlord is permitted to use the security deposit 
toward the following: 

• Damage to the premises caused by the tenant or their pet, or due to the negligence of

the tenant or their guest;

• Unpaid rent;
• Cost of cleaning or other repairs the tenant is responsible for to return the unit to its

original state, except for reasonable wear and tear.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 23 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

If the landlord uses all or part of the security deposit, the landlord must provide a written 
description/itemized list of damages and charges.  The itemized statement must be sent to the 
tenant at the last address they provided, and must include the amount of the refund or any 
amount due to the landlord. 

A landlord who, without justification, withholds any portion of a security deposit is liable for 
triple the amount withheld. 

NOTE: The landlord is required to put your security deposit in an interest bearing or checking 
account.  If you occupied the property for 9 months or more, you’re also entitled to the amount 
of interest that accrued on the original security deposit amount. 

(See Section 47-16-07.1 of the North Dakota Century Code.) 

Abandoned property – Less than $2,500: 

If, after you move out, you leave your personal property for 28 days or longer, your personal 
property is considered abandoned.  If the total estimated value of your abandoned personal 
property is less than $2500.00, the landlord may dispose of or sell your personal property 
without giving you any notice.   

Before an eviction, the landlord can do the following with the proceeds from selling your 
abandoned property: 

•
Keep all the money;
• Recover security deposit;
• Reimburse the storage fees for storing your abandoned property.

After an eviction, the landlord can do the following with the proceeds from selling your 
abandoned property: 

•

Put a lien on your items for reasonable costs associated with storing and removing your
abandoned property.

• Retain possession of your property until charges (court associated fees and eviction

money judgment) have been paid off.

(See Section 47-16-30.1 of the North Dakota Century Code.) 

Other ways the eviction judgment against you can be enforced: 

The eviction judgment may impact your credit score or ability to lease in the future: 

• North Dakota State District Court eviction judgments are publically available.  This may

impact your credit score and have a negative impact on renting in the future.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 24 of 25 

Eviction-Tenants/Rev Jun 2022

If the landlord was awarded money as part of the eviction order, the landlord may use 
judgment collection options to collect the money.  For example: 

•

Formal Discovery to Identify your Assets:

o A landlord may use the same types of discovery options available during civil

actions, such as interrogatories (written questions) and production of
documents, to find assets that may be available to pay the judgment.

• Garnishment:

o A judgment collection option where the landlord tries to obtain funds which are
your property, but are held by a third party, such as an employer.  If you’re
working, garnishment allows the landlord to take a percentage of your paycheck
to pay the money the eviction order says you owe.

•

Lien Against Real Property:

o If you own real property (real estate) in North Dakota, the landlord may file the
judgment in the county where the real property is located.  The judgment is a
lien against the property that may be satisfied if the property is sold.

• Renew the Judgment for Another 10 Years:

o Money awarded in an eviction order is collectable for 10 years.  90 days before
the eviction order expires, if the money awarded has not been collected, the
landlord may renew the order for another 10 years.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
