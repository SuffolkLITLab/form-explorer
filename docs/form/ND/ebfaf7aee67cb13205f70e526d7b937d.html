North Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-06.6 allows a court to consider modification

of primary residential responsibility after two years from the date of entry of the order 

establishing primary residential responsibility, or after two years from the date of entry of the 

order on a motion to modify primary residential responsibility.  North Dakota Century Code 

Section 14-09-06.6 allows a court to consider modification of primary residential responsibility 

if the parenting plan includes a time frame earlier than two years.  

8.

Amended Judgment allows modification before two years when (state event/ 

circumstances):

Before a court will grant a full, in-person evidentiary hearing, the party requesting

modification must show, in writing, (I) that there is a significant or material change in 

circumstances that justifies modification of primary residential responsibility, and (II) that 

modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the children.

I: Plaintiff’s/Defendant’s (choose one) prima facie case that a material change of 

circumstances that justifies modification of primary residential responsibility has occurred. 

10.

Before the court will grant an in-person hearing, the court must find that the party

requesting modification made a prima facie case that “[o]n the basis of facts that have arisen 

since the prior order or which were unknown to the court at the time of the prior order, a 

material change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the parties . . ..” (North 

Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-06.6(6)(a)). 

11.

There have been significant and material changes in circumstances, which are based on

the following facts that were not known at the time of the judgment Plaintiff/Defendant 

(choose one) is asking the court to modify. 

(Describe the facts that support Paragraph 11. Number each paragraph of your facts as

12.
12(a), 12(b), 12(c), and so on.  If you refer to facts from your supporting affidavit, other

supporting affidavits, or documents, include the title of the affidavit or document in parentheses

following the reference.)

(Paragraph 12, Continued) 

II: Plaintiff’s/Defendant’s (choose one) prima facie case that modification of 

primary residential responsibility is necessary to serve the best interests of the children. 

13.

If the court finds that the Plaintiff/Defendant (choose one) established a prima facie

case that a material change of circumstances that justifies modification of primary residential 

responsibility has occurred, the court can grant an in-person hearing if the court finds that the 

party requesting modification made a prima facie case that modification of primary residential 

responsibility is necessary to serve the best interests of the children. 

14.

The factors used by the court to determine best interests are listed in North Dakota

Century Code Section 14-09-06.2.  Based on the best interest factors, modification of primary 

residential responsibility is necessary to serve the best interests of the children as follows:
