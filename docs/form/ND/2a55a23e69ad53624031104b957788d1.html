      <pre>Health Care Directives Research Guide 
A Legal Research Guide for North Dakota Health Care Directives 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide ISN’T a complete statement of the law. This 
information is intended as a starting point for your legal research into Health Care Directives. 

This information isn’t intended for legal advice and can’t replace the advice of competent legal 
counsel licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota. 

The self-represented individual must make ALL decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references doesn’t mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource. Use at your own risk. 

No Health Care Directive Forms Available 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center and the North Dakota Court System *don’t* have 
forms or instructions for Health Care Directives. 

If you represent yourself, you create your own legal documents. 

If you decide to create your own Health Care Directive, you may find the following resources of 
interest: 

•  The North Dakota State Legislature included a suggested Health Care Directive form 

when they enacted North Dakota Century Code Chapter 23-06.5: Health Care Directives. 
Chapter 23-06.5 is available at ndlegis.gov/cencode/t23c06-5.html 

o  The form in Chapter 23-06.5 isn’t a printable form. You create your own Health 
Care Directive by copying and pasting the text from the Chapter 23-06.5 
suggested form into a word processing program, such as MS Word, WordPerfect, 
Google Docs, or Open Office. 

•  Legal Services of North Dakota may have Health Care Directive forms available to North 

Dakota residents who meet their income requirements for free legal assistance. 

o  Legal Services of North Dakota publishes an informational brochure about Health 

Care Directives on their webpage at legalassist.org. 

NDLSHC Research Guide

Health Care Directives/Rev Dec 2022 

 

•  Health care providers may have Health Care Directive forms available for their patients. 

Contact your health care provider and ask if they have forms available. 

•  Many public and academic libraries have subscriptions to forms services, which are 
available to library patrons. You may wish to contact your local public or academic 
library and ask if they have access to any legal forms services that include North Dakota 
living will, healthcare directive or durable power of attorney for health care forms. 

o 

If you decide to use a form available through a forms service, you must 
independently determine if the Health Care Directive form is legally sufficient for 
North Dakota and suitable for your circumstances. 

o  Review Chapter 23-06.5 of the North Dakota Century Code to help you decide if 

the form is legally sufficient for North Dakota.  

CAUTION!  Avoid using forms from other states! Each state has their own health care directive 

laws. Another state’s form may not comply with North Dakota’s laws. 

Center staff can’t tell you if a Health Care Directive form is legally sufficient for North Dakota 
or suitable for you. This requires legal advice, which isn’t available from the Center under any 
circumstances. 

If you’re interested in finding a lawyer to prepare your Health Care Directive, go to Page 9 for 
all of the lawyer resources available through the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center. 

If you’d like to learn more about finding a lawyer to represent you, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-

Overview of Health Care Directives 

What is a Health Care Directive?  

A Health Care Directive, also referred to as a Health Care Power of Attorney, is a written 
document executed by an adult (the principal) to appoint someone (the agent) to make health 
care decisions for them when they become unable to make those decisions for themselves. 

What does legal capacity to make a Health Care Directive mean? 

This means you (the principal) must have the ability to understand and appreciate the nature 
and consequences of your health care decisions, including the significant benefits and harms of, 
and ability to communicate your health care decisions. 

Are there requirements I must follow so my Health Care Directive is legal in North Dakota? 

Yes , to be legally sufficient in North Dakota, a Health Care Directive must: 

1.  Be in writing;  

2.  Be dated;  

3.  State your name;  

4.  Be signed by you (the principal). If you aren’t able to sign, it must be signed by another 

person authorized by you to sign on your behalf; 

5.  Contain verification of your signature or the signature of the person authorized by you 
to sign on your behalf. This is done by either one notary public or two witnesses; *and* 

6.  Include a health care instruction or a power of attorney for health care, or both.  

Are there restrictions on who can act as my agent? 

Yes , first and most importantly, your agent *must* be an adult (18 years of age or older). 

A person *can’t* act as your agent while serving in one the following capacities: 

1.  Your health care provider;  

2.  A nonrelative of yours who is an employee of your health care provider;  

3.  Your long-term care services provider; or  

4.  A nonrelative of yours who is an employee of your long-term care services provider. 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 4 of 9 

Health Care Directives/Rev Dec 2022 

What are the requirements for verifying my signature? 

A Health Care Directive must be signed by you *and* your signature must be verified by one 
notary public *or* at least two or more witnesses who are at least eighteen years of age.  

Review Section 23-06.5-05(2) of the North Dakota Century Code for all of the requirements. 

Are there restrictions on who can witness my Health Care Directive? 

Yes , review Section 23-06.5-05(2) of the North Dakota Century Code for the restrictions. 

How does the person I appointed agree to act as my agent? 

The person you appointed as your agent must accept the appointment in writing. Generally, the 
written acceptance of the agent is part of the Health Care Directive document. 

When does my Health Care Directive become effective so my agent can act for me? 

A Health Care Directive becomes effective *only* when you lack the capacity to make health 
care decisions. Your attending physician certifies, in writing, that you lack the capacity to make 
health care decisions. This notice is filed in your medical record. 

The certified notice by your attending physician is no longer effective upon a determination 
that you’ve recovered capacity.  

However, in the Health Care Directive document, you can direct that your agent is able to make 
health care decisions for you even if you retain capacity to make health care decisions. In that 
case, the Health Care Directive is in effect as stated in your Health Care Directive under any 
conditions you may impose. 

If my spouse is my agent and we get divorced, are they still my agent? 

Divorce automatically ends the appointment of your spouse as your agent, unless your Health 
Care Directive specifically says your spouse remains your agent even if you divorce. 

Can I revoke (cancel) my Health Care Directive? 

YES , you can revoke, or cancel, your Health Care Directive: 

1.  By notifying your agent or health care or long-term care services provider orally or in 
writing, or by any other act evidencing a specific intent to revoke the directive; or 

2.  By executing a new Health Care Directive.

Health Care Directives/Rev Dec 2022 

Where should I keep my Health Care Directive? 

Keep your Health Care Directive in a safe, accessible place. 

Be sure the agent you named in your Health Care Directive (the person you appointed to make 
your health care decisions) knows where it is. 

Consider giving your agent a copy or copies of your Health Care Directive. 

Consider giving your health care provider(s) a copy or copies of your Health Care Directive.   

Note:   According to Section 23-06.5-13 of the North Dakota Century Code, a copy of a 

Health Care Directive is presumed to be a true and accurate copy of the executed original, 
absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and *must* be given the same effect 
as an original. 

Do I file my Health Care Directive with a North Dakota State District Court? 

No , Health Care Directives aren’t filed with a North Dakota State District Court. 

The Clerk of District Court will only accept your Health Care Directive for filing if it’s part of a 
court case, such as a case to establish a guardianship of an adult. 

Can I register my Health Care Directive? 

Yes , if you would like to register your Health Care Directive, you may do so through the North 

Dakota Health Information Network (NDIHN) Health Care Directive Registry. 

The North Dakota Health Care Directive Registry was developed for North Dakota citizens to 
securely store and share their Health Care Directives. 

Information about the registry is available at ndhin.nd.gov/services-0/nd-health-care-directive-
registry. Registration for the registry is available at apps.nd.gov/itd/hin/hdir/login.

Century Code contains the laws enacted by the North Dakota Legislature. The NDCC is available 
online at ndlegis.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code.) 

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 23-06.5 contains laws relating to Health Care Directives. 

•  See N.D.C.C. Section 23-06.5-04 for restrictions on who can act as agent. 

•  See N.D.C.C. Section 23-06.5-05 for Health Care Directive requirements for signatures 

and witnesses. 

•  See N.D.C.C. Section 23-06.5-06 for acceptance of appointment and withdrawal. 

•  See N.D.C.C. Section 23-06.5-07 for revocation of a Health Care Directive. 

•  See N.D.C.C. Section 23-06.5-13 for presumptions and application of a Health Care 

Directive.

North Dakota Case Law  
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 
Supreme Court case law is available online at ndcourts.gov/supreme-court/opinions.) 

Case law is a useful legal research tool for interpreting what a law means. 

You may search for keywords within North Dakota Supreme Court case law. Go to 
ndcourts.gov/supreme-court/opinions and enter the keywords into the “Enter query” text box. 
Then, click on the “Search” button. North Dakota Supreme Court opinions containing your 
keywords will be listed on the page.

You may also use the print version of the North Dakota Century Code. Short summaries of case 
law are located after the text of each Section of the Century Code. To view the full text of the 
opinion, go to ndcourts.gov/supreme-court/opinions and enter the case name or case citation.  

Laws Constantly Change    

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, court rules, 
administrative rules and rulings, and case law. 

If you need assistance determining whether specific laws, rules or case law apply to your 
situation, or determining how they apply to your situation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice 
in North Dakota who can agree to represent you. 

Only a lawyer who has agreed to represent you can give you legal advice. Legal advice includes 
interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your circumstances.

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries. Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the library staff of your local 
North Dakota library how to request the book.
