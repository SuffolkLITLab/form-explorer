INFORMATION ABOUT CONTESTED DIVORCE IN NORTH DAKOTA 

WHAT IS A CONTESTED DIVORCE? 

If you and your spouse aren’t in agreement on every issue in your divorce, or you don’t know 
where to find your spouse, you have a contested divorce. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE CONTESTED DIVORCE FORMS? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have a packet of forms for contested divorce.  If you 
decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own contested divorce documents.  The 
names and descriptions of the documents you’ll need to create are found throughout this 
guide.  Formatting examples of common contested divorce documents are found at the end 
of this guide. 

You may find the General-Use template forms of interest as a starting point for creating your 
own divorce documents. 

The General-Use template forms are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking on the 
"General Use Checklists and Forms" link under “District Court Civil”.   

•  The direct link to the General-Use template forms is ndcourts.gov/legal-self-

help/general-use-forms. 

You may find the forms in the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual of interest.  
The Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual contains a variety of divorce forms that 
were created for lawyers to use as examples in family law cases.  The Legal Services of North 
Dakota website is legalassist.org. 

(References to the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual are for your convenience 
only.  The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t endorse, warrant, or accept responsibility for the 
content or uses of the Family Law Manual. You must independently determine the legal 
sufficiency of the forms in the Family Law Manual.  Use at your own risk.)  

IS THERE HELP AVAILABLE FOR CREATING DIVORCE DOCUMENTS? 

If you’d like assistance creating your documents, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.  Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to practice in 
North Dakota may agree to help you with part of your divorce, such as preparing legal 
documents, while you handle the rest of the divorce.  You and the lawyer must agree in writing 
to Limited Legal Representation.

WHAT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TERMS IN A 
DIVORCE ACTION? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they aren’t intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Assets – everything owned by either spouse, whether owned jointly or individually. For 
example, real estate, cars, furniture, bank accounts, jewelry, life insurance policies, businesses, 
and retirement plans. 

Child Support – payments for the support of a child, including payments for health insurance 
coverage or other medical support, and payments for the support of spouses or former spouses 
with whom the child is living as long as the spousal support payment is owed to the spouse or 
former spouse under the same order as the payments for the child, if the payment is required 
by the order of a court or other governmental agency having authority to issue such orders, and 
includes past-due support. 

Decision making responsibility – the responsibility to make decisions concerning the minor 
child.  The term may refer to decisions on all issues or on specific issues, but not child support. 

Debts – (also called Liabilities) everything owed by either spouse, whether owed jointly or 
individually. For example, mortgages, credit cards, car loans, and student loans. 

Deploying or deployed parent – a deploying or deployed parent is a uniformed service member 
who has been notified of orders of movement or mobilization for more than ninety days but 
less than eighteen months AND the orders are designated as unaccompanied, not authorized 
for dependent travel, or don’t permit family members to move to the deployment location. 

Equitable distribution – (also called Equitable Division) marital property is distributed equitably 
(fairly) in a divorce.  A court would make an equitable distribution based on the following: 

•  Respective ages of the spouses; 
•  Earning ability; 
•  Duration of the marriage and conduct of the spouses during the marriage; 
•  Station in life; 
•  Circumstances and necessities of the spouses; 
•  Health and physical condition; 
•  Financial circumstances as shown by the property owned at the time; 
•  Value of the property owned at the time; 
Income-producing capacity of the property owned at the time, if any; 
• 
•  Whether the property was accumulated before or after the marriage; and 
•  Any other matters that may be material. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Contested Divorce /Rev. Apr 2022 

Generally, the factors above are applied when spouses don’t agree.  However, a court has the 
authority to decide whether a settlement agreement between the spouses was entered into as 
a result of mistake, duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence. 

Home state – the state in which a minor child lived with a parent for at least six consecutive 
months immediately before the start of a child custody proceeding. In the case of a child less 
than six months of age, home state means the state in which the child lived from birth with a 
parent.  A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period. 

Irreconcilable differences – (also called No Fault) substantial reasons for not continuing the 
marriage and which make it appear the marriage should be dissolved.  The court need only find 
that irreconcilable differences exist.  

Marital property – all of the assets and debts owned or owed by either spouse, whether owned 
or owed jointly or individually. 

Obligor – the person ordered by the court to pay child support or spousal support. 

Obligee – the person receiving child support or spousal support ordered by the court. 

Parental rights and responsibilities – all the rights and responsibilities a parent has concerning 
the parent's minor child. 

Parenting plan – a written plan describing each parent's rights and responsibilities. 

Parenting schedule – the schedule of when the minor child is in the care of each parent. 

Parenting time – the time when the minor child is to be in the care of a parent.  (Also known as 
visitation.) 

Personal property – every kind of property that isn’t real property.  (See real property 
definition below.)  Personal property includes, but isn’t limited to, cars, furniture, bank 
accounts, jewelry, life insurance policies, businesses, and retirement plans. 

Primary residential responsibility – a parent with more than fifty percent of the residential 
responsibility. 

Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) – an order of the court that directs the 
administrator of a retirement plan to divide retirement assets as granted in a divorce judgment.  
There are many different QDRO’s that are specific to the type of retirement plan.  For more 
information about QDRO’s, go to dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/workers-and-families/separation-and-
divorce and scroll to the “Retirement” section. 

***If you divide a retirement asset between spouses, a QDRO is required. Consulting a lawyer is 
strongly recommended when dividing a retirement asset!***

Real property – land either with or without buildings on it.  For example, a home is real 
property.  

Residency requirement – the amount of time a spouse must live in North Dakota before they 
can ask a North Dakota district court to grant a divorce.  The residency requirement for North 
Dakota is 6 months. 

Residential responsibility – a parent's responsibility to provide a home for the child.  (Also 
known as custody.) 

WHO ARE THE PARTIES IN A DIVORCE? 

Plaintiff (or Petitioner) – The spouse who starts the contested divorce proceeding by serving a 
summons and complaint for divorce on the other spouse. 

Defendant (or Respondent) – The spouse who is served the summons and complaint for 
divorce by the other spouse. 

Real Party in Interest – The State of North Dakota is added as a real party in interest to 
parenting rights and responsibilities actions only when: 

•  Child support will be established or modified and a minor child receives assistance 

through programs administered by the North Dakota Department of Human Services, 
such as temporary assistance to needy families, Medicaid, and foster care; or 

•  Child support will be established or modified and an application was made and accepted 
for services provided by the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of 
Human Services; or 

•  Child support or spousal support will be established or modified and North Dakota or 
the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services is 
required to be involved in proceedings related to support orders of other states or 
countries under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. 

(Also known as the Statutory Real Party in Interest.) 

WHAT IS THE NORTH DAKOTA RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT FOR DIVORCE? 

The Plaintiff must be a North Dakota resident for six consecutive months before the divorce.

WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO DIVORCE? 

Interpreting what the law means for a specific set of circumstances is a fundamental part of 
legal representation.  ND Legal Self Help Center staff can’t provide legal representation of any 
kind under any circumstances.  Legal representation can only be provided to you by an attorney 
who has agreed to represent you. 

Chapter 14-05 of the North Dakota Century Code governs divorce.  Review the entire Chapter.  
ndlegis.gov/cencode/t14c05.html 

Chapter 14-09 of the North Dakota Century Code governs parenting rights and responsibilities, 
such as custody, visitation, and child support.  Review the entire Chapter.  
ndlegis.gov/cencode/t14c09.html 

Chapter 14-12.2 of the North Dakota Century Code governs enforcement and modification of 
child support and spousal support orders issued by other states or countries.  
ndlegis.gov/cencode/t14c12-2.html 

Chapter 14-14.1 of the North Dakota Century Code governs which state can make decisions 
about child custody issues and enforce child custody orders.  You’ll need to determine if a 
North Dakota District Court can make decisions about child custody in your divorce.  
ndlegis.gov/cencode/t14c14-1.html 

Chapter 14-05, 14-09, 14-12.2 and 14-14.1 are Chapters within Title 14 of the North Dakota 
Century Code.  There are many other laws related to families in Title 14.  You may find them of 
interest.  ndlegis.gov/cencode/t14.html 

The North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to civil matters in North Dakota district courts.  
The rules are found at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp.   

The North Dakota Rules of Court apply to civil matters in North Dakota district courts.  The 
rules are found at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct. 

See particularly:  

•  Rule 8.2 (Interim Orders), 
•  Rule 8.3 (Case Management), 
•  Rule 8.4 (Divorce Summons), and 
•  Rule 8.5 (Summary Divorce). 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to civil matters in North Dakota district courts.  The 
rules are found at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev.

North Dakota case law is useful for interpreting what the law means for your individual 
circumstances. 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

One way to research case law related to divorce, is to use the print version of the North Dakota 
Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each Section of the Century Code.  
The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the Century Code Section. 

To view the full text of the opinion, go to ndcourts.gov, click on the “Opinions” link under 
“Supreme Court” and enter the case name or case citation. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions).  Notes of case law (court decisions) 
related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are found in many North Dakota public 
and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

WHAT ARE LEGAL REASONS (GROUNDS) FOR DIVORCE? 

•  Adultery 
•  Extreme cruelty 
•  Willful desertion 
•  Willful neglect 
•  Abuse of alcohol or controlled substance 
•  Conviction of a felony 
• 

Irreconcilable differences (no fault) 

Irreconcilable differences is also called a no fault divorce.  Neither spouse is required to prove 
the other spouse is at fault for the divorce and the court doesn’t decide which spouse is at 
fault.  Irreconcilable differences only require the court to decide there are substantial reasons 
for not continuing the marriage, which make it appear the marriage should be dissolved. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Contested Divorce /Rev. Apr 2022 

WHAT ARE COMMON DIVORCE ISSUES RELATED TO SPOUSES? 

•  Spousal support, including alimony 
•  Dividing property between spouses 
•  Dividing debts between spouses 
•  Name change back to the pre-marriage last name 

In North Dakota, property and debt are divided equitably (fairly), not equally, in a divorce.  The 
court may redistribute property and debts after the divorce is granted if a spouse failed to 
disclose property and debts, or if a spouse fails to follow the terms of the court order 
distributing property and debts. 

The court will consider the following when deciding whether to award spousal support and 
when deciding how to equitably divide property and debt:  

•  Age of each spouse, 
•  Earning ability,  
•  Length of the marriage,  
•  Conduct of each spouse during the marriage, 
•  Station in life, 
•  Circumstances and necessities of each spouse, 
•  Health and physical condition of each spouse, 
•  Financial circumstances as shown by property owned at the time, its value at the time, 

its income-producing capacity, if any, whether accumulated before or after the 
marriage, and 

•  Other matters that may be material. 

A note about dividing pension or retirement plans: 

Dividing pension plans and retirement accounts is extremely complicated. The spouses are 
responsible for making sure these assets are divided, which will require a separate court order 
to divide these assets.  The separate court order is called a qualified domestic relations order 
(QDRO) and the parties are responsible for obtaining a proposed QDRO and presenting the 
proposed QDRO to the court.  The court won’t draft a QDRO document or an order including a 
QDRO. 

***The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have QDRO forms or instructions and can’t assist with 
drafting or obtaining QDRO’s.  Consulting a lawyer is strongly recommended when dividing a 
retirement asset!*** 

(If neither spouse has pension nor retirement plans, OR if the spouses will keep their own 
pension or retirement plans, a QDRO isn’t necessary.)

When spouses can’t agree on custody and visitation, the court will decide based on the best 
interests of the children.  The best interest factors are found in § 14-09-06.2 of the North 
Dakota Century Code. 

Child Support: 

WARNING: If you don’t want to establish child support as part of your divorce case, the court 
will still require you to complete the child support calculations.  The court will ultimately decide 
whether to hold off on payment of the child support amount.  Usually, the court will wait to 
decide until after the Child Support Division tells the court whether they agree. 

Child support is based on guidelines set by the North Dakota Department of Human Services.  If 
a parent can show a different ability to earn income than the guidelines show, the court may 
order a higher or lower child support payment. 

The Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services created and 
provides support for the Child Support Guidelines Calculator. The Calculator can be found at 
childsupport.dhs.nd.gov/lawyers/child-support-guidelines. 

The Child Support Division may be able to provide some assistance with your child support 
calculations. (701-328-5440; 800-231-4255) 

Court personnel and staff of the ND Legal Self Help Center can’t assist with child support 
calculations. 

WARNING: If you plan to ask the court to allow a parent to pay a different amount of child 
support than the Child Support Guidelines Calculator amount, you’re strongly urged to consult 
a lawyer for assistance.  The Calculator amount is presumed to be the correct amount of child 
support.  The parent asking for a deviation from the Calculator amount must prove they meet 
one of the limited exceptions for deviation, and the deviation is in the best interests of the 
child(ren).  See North Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-09.7 and North Dakota 
Administrative Code Section 75-02-04.1-09.

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION  

You’re not required to hire a lawyer to bring an action for divorce in North Dakota District 
Court.  If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures 
that a lawyer is required to follow. 

Lawyer Resources 

If you decide to find a lawyer to represent you, you may find the following options of interest. 

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income. Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income. The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is 
legalassist.org. 

•  The State Bar Association of North Dakota provides a lawyer referral service to match 
paying clients in need of legal services with lawyers. The phone number is (866) 450-

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions. Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that a lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case. You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled. For example: 

•  You may want a lawyer to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your legal 

•  You can consult with a lawyer to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend 

rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with a 

lawyer who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire a lawyer just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

FROM BEGINNING TO END 

PART ONE: THE PLAINTIFF STARTS THE CONTESTED DIVORCE ACTION BY 
SERVING THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT ON THE DEFENDANT 

Service of a copy of the summons and complaint on the other spouse starts a divorce action in

restraining provisions contained in the summons. 

Determine Whether North Dakota is a Real Party in Interest: 

Review Section 14-09-09.26 of the North Dakota Century Code to determine if the State of 
North Dakota must be listed on your court documents as a Real Party in Interest. 

If the State of North Dakota is a Real Party in Interest, list “State of North Dakota” in the caption 
of all of the documents you create.  See the complaint with children in the examples of 
documents found at the end of this Informational Guide. 

The Plaintiff Creates the Following Documents:

Filing with the Clerk of District Court doesn’t start a divorce action and isn’t required to start a 
divorce action. 

The Defendant has twenty-one (21) days, not including the date of service, to serve a written 
answer on the Plaintiff.  If the Plaintiff is represented by a lawyer, serve the written answer on 
the lawyer.  If the Defendant doesn’t respond within twenty-one (21) days, not including the

PART FOUR: AFTER THE CONTESTED DIVORCE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT ARE

Dakota Rules of Court. 

Within 10 days of filing the contested case, you may be referred to the Family Mediation 
Program for mediation of the disputed or unresolved parental rights and responsibilities issues. 
The Family Law Mediation Program will provide up to 6 hours of combined pre-mediation 
orientation and mediation at no cost to the spouses. 

If your case is referred to the Family Mediation Program, you’ll receive an order and schedule 
for mediation. Read the order and schedule carefully, as you’ll need to follow the requirements 
and meet the deadlines. 

For more information about the Family Mediation Program, go to ndcourts.gov/state-court-
administration/family-law-mediation-program.

The Court Issues a Scheduling Order: 

Review Rule 8.3 of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

Within 30 days after the summons and complaint and the joint informational statement are 
filed with the Clerk of District Court, the court must issue its scheduling order.  The court may 
require a scheduling conference in-court or by telephone before issuing the scheduling order. 

The scheduling order may establish any of the following deadlines for the contested divorce:  

•  Specific dates to complete discovery and other pretrial preparations; 
•  Specific dates for serving, filing, or hearing motions; 
•  Specific dates to complete mediation/alternative dispute resolution; 
•  A specific date for the parties to complete parent/divorce education; 
•  A specific date for filing the property and debt listing; 
•  Specific dates to complete parenting evaluations; 
•  A specific date by which the parties will be prepared for the pretrial conference; 
•  A specific date by which the parties will be prepared for the trial; 
•  A specific date for identification of witnesses and documents; and 
•  A specific date by which the parties will submit the parenting plans. 

Read the order and schedule carefully, as you’ll need to follow the requirements and meet the 
deadlines. 

Either Spouse May Request an Interim or Temporary Order: 

Review Rule 8.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

Generally, either spouse can request an interim order after a contested divorce case is filed.   

This is a request for a temporary order for support, parental rights and responsibilities, 
attorney’s fees and costs, and use of property.  The interim order, if signed by the court, is in 
effect until there is a different order or a final decision in the case. 

Informational guides for making a motion for an interim order, and answering a motion for an 
interim order are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/temporary-orders.

Appointment of a Parenting Investigator or Guardian Ad Litem for the Child(ren): 

Review § 14-09-06.3 and § 14-09-06.4 of the North Dakota Century Code.  Review Rule 8.6 and 
Rule 8.11 of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

When one of the contested issues in a divorce is parenting rights and responsibilities, either 
spouse may make a motion to the court to appoint a parenting investigator or a guardian ad 
litem to represent the child concerning parenting rights and responsibilities. 

The court may require one or both spouses to pay the guardian ad litem or investigator fees. 

If neither spouse is able to pay the fees, the court may require that the county pay the fees, in 
whole or in part. The court may then require one or both spouses to reimburse the county, in 
whole or in part, for payment of the fees. 

Prepare Proposed Parenting Plans: 

If your contested divorce involves children, a parenting plan is required to be part of the final 
divorce judgment. 

If you and your spouse don’t agree to a parenting plan, you’ll each likely need to prepare a 
proposed parenting plan as part of the contested divorce proceedings. 

The State Bar Association of North Dakota created a Model North Dakota Parenting Plan that 
may be of interest to you.  It’s found in the Parenting Plan section of the Legal Services of North 
Dakota Family Law Manual.  It’s also found on the State Bar Association of North Dakota 
website of sband.org. 

Spouses May Settle All or Part of the Issues in the Contested Divorce: 

At any point during the contested divorce, spouses may discuss settlement of all or part of the 
issues. 

If you and your spouse reach an agreement on an issue, prepare a written settlement 
agreement.  This may also be referred to as a stipulation or a stipulated agreement.  Written 
settlement agreements must be signed by both spouses in the presence of a notary public. 

Written settlement agreements are filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Prepare for and Attend All Scheduled Hearings: 

Various types of hearings may occur throughout your contested divorce.  For example, you may 
have a hearing on a motion for an interim order, a scheduling conference, or a pre-trial 
conference. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 24 of 31 

Contested Divorce /Rev. Apr 2022 

You must attend all hearings that are scheduled unless you have received permission from the 
court not to attend. 

You can ask the court for permission to attend a hearing by telephone or by some other reliable 
electronic means.  The court isn’t required to grant this type of request.  Forms and instructions 
for this request can be found at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the “Miscellaneous” section.  
Click on the “Appear by Phone or Other Electronic Means Request” link. 

PART FIVE: PRE-TRIAL PREPARATION 

If you and your spouse don’t reach a settlement on all issues, your contested divorce will 
eventually go to trial.  Issues on which you and your spouse don’t agree will be decided by a 
District Court Judge. 

Caution!  Preparing for trial is often a complex and confusing process.  You’re held to same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or procedures.  
This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You’ll need to conduct additional 
research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

Library Resources: (Not all legal resources are available online.) 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

Finish Your Pre-Trial Preparations: 

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully!  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence 
govern whether your evidence is admitted at trial.  The Rules also govern how you object to 
evidence your spouse wants to admit at trial. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the “District 

Court Civil” section.  Click on the "Evidence" link. 

Review Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully!  If you require a witness 
to appear at trial or require production of documents, electronically stored information or 
other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District Court to issue a subpoena.  Only a 
Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

•  A Subpoena Informational Guide is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the 

“District Court Civil” section.  Click on the "Subpoenas" link. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the trial.  At minimum, 
prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments.

PART SIX: TRIAL 

The trial is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the judge.  The trial is the final 
hearing in a contested divorce action.  The decision of the judge is called a judgment. 

Caution!  Representing yourself at trial is often a complex and confusing process.  You’re held 
to same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or 
procedures.  This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You’ll need to 
conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review the Library Resources above in Part Five: Pre-Trial Preparation. 

If You Need Special Assistance at the Trial: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible.  Contact information is available at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Trial: 

Don’t miss your trial date and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to 
court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the Clerk of District Court as soon as you can. 

Bring the Information, Documents, Etc. you Prepared for the Trial: 

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc. that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
trial.  Bring the outline of what you want to say. 

Conduct of the Trial: 

The judge, in a contested divorce trial, hears both sides and then issues a final judgment.  
Sometimes, the final judgment is issued at the end of the trial.  Often, the final judgment is 
issued at a later date. 

Before the trial officially begins:  

•  Organize your files and paperwork on your assigned table in the courtroom so you can 

easily locate information as needed. 

(This space left intentionally blank.) 

 

   

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 28 of 31 

Contested Divorce /Rev. Apr 2022 

In general, a trial in a contested divorce action proceeds in the following order:  

o  The trial officially begins when all are asked to rise when the judge comes into 

• 

Judge Begins the Trial 

the courtroom. 

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each spouse gives an opening statement.  Usually, the Plaintiff goes first. 

•  Plaintiff Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Plaintiff presents their case first.  The Defendant may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the Plaintiff’s evidence. 

•  Defendant Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Defendant presents their case after the Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff may cross-

examine witnesses and object to the Defendant’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each spouse gives a closing argument.  Usually, the Plaintiff goes first.  

Before You Leave the Courthouse: 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

PART SEVEN: FINAL DIVORCE JUDGMENT 

You’re not divorced until a final judgment of divorce is signed by the judge and filed with the 
Clerk of District Court. 

Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment: 

Review Rule 52 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court carefully! 

Findings of fact are the judge’s written determination of the facts made from the evidence 
presented. This explains what facts the judge found to be true. 

Conclusions of law are the rulings of law made by the judge based on, or in connection with, 
the findings of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the judge found to be true. 

If applicable, the parenting plan must be included in the conclusions of law, or incorporated by 
reference into the conclusions of law if the parenting plan is a separate document. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 29 of 31 

Contested Divorce /Rev. Apr 2022 

The judge may require one or both spouses to prepare and file proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and an order for judgment.  The proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law 
and an order for judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of service filed with the 
Clerk of District Court. 

The judge will decide whether the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for 
judgment are appropriate.  If the judge decides they are appropriate, the judge will sign and 
date the findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment.  The findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and order for judgment aren’t official until signed and dated by the judge. 

Proposed Judgment: 

Review Rule 54 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court carefully! 

The judgment is the written order of the judge’s final decision in your contested divorce. 

If applicable, the parenting plan must be included in the judgment, or incorporated by 
reference into the judgment if the parenting plan is a separate document. 

The judge may require one or both spouses to prepare and file a proposed judgment.  The 
proposed judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of service filed with the Clerk 
of District Court. 

The judge will decide whether the proposed judgment is appropriate.  If the judge decides it is 
appropriate, the judge will sign and date the judgment.  You’re not divorced until a final 
judgment of divorce is signed by the judge and filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Notice of Entry of Judgment 

Review Rule 58 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Within 14 days after the judgment is entered, the prevailing spouse must serve notice of entry 
of judgment on the other spouse.  A copy of the judgment must be included with the notice of 
entry of judgment.  See the “Notice of Entry of Judgment” form at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/general-use-forms. 

After service is complete, the prevailing spouse must file the original, completed Notice of Entry 
of Judgment and proof of service on the other spouse with the Clerk of District Court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
