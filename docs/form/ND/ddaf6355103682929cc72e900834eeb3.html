      <pre>SUBPOENAS IN CIVIL ACTIONS 

An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves in 
civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this informational guide 
isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, 
even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this information suits your 
circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about 
subpoenas in a North Dakota State District Court civil action.  The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the information provided.  The information can’t replace the 
advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

 

CAUTION! 
A self-represented individual may only represent themselves in a North Dakota state district 
court civil action. 

If a Plaintiff/Petitioner or Defendant/Respondent is an artificial person, such as a business, 
corporation or limited liability company, a non-attorney can’t represent the artificial person in 
a North Dakota state district court civil action.  Consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.

Subpoena Civil Actions /Rev. Sep 2021 

WHAT IS A SUBPOENA? 

A subpoena is the process to require the attendance of a non-party witness at deposition, 
hearing or trial. 

A subpoena is also the process to require a non-party to produce documents, electronically 
stored information or tangible things; or to require the inspection of premises. 

Subpoenas may be used by a party in a civil action to require a non-party to do the following at 
a specific time and place: 

•  Attend and testify at a deposition, hearing or trial; 
•  Produce the documents listed in the subpoena; 
•  Produce the electronically stored information listed in the subpoena; 
•  Produce the tangible things listed in the subpoena (the tangible things must be in the 

person’s possession, custody or control); or 

•  Permit the inspection of the premises listed in the subpoena. 

If a party wants to require a non-party to do more than one of the actions listed above, the 
party may include the actions in one subpoena, or use a separate subpoena for each action. 

LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO SUBPOENAS IN A CIVIL ACTION: 

Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure governs the subpoena process. 

NOTE: This Informational Guide gives the basics of the subpoena process, but doesn’t 
cover every possible issue or situation.  Review Rule 45 carefully to meet the 
requirements for subpoenas in your civil action.  Other Rules may apply to your 
particular circumstances that aren’t included in this Informational Guide. 

Rule 5(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the summons and 
complaint, or a summons and petition, or other initiating document of the civil action must be 
filed with the court before a subpoena may be issued. 

Chapter 31-01 of the North Dakota Century Code governs witness qualifications, rights and 
duties. 

•  Section 31-01-16 of Chapter 31-01 of the North Dakota Century Code governs witness 

fees, mileage and travel expense reimbursement for witnesses. 

•  Also see Section 44-08-04 and Section 54-06-09 for calculating mileage and travel 

expense reimbursement for witnesses. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Subpoena Civil Actions /Rev. Sep 2021 

Chapter 31-03 of the North Dakota Century Code governs the means of compelling attendance 
of witnesses. 

North Dakota court rules apply in North Dakota District Court.  The rules are available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.  The rules are available in print in many North Dakota 
public and academic libraries. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, administrative 
rulings and court decisions. 

Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the 
North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are available in 
many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

WHO CAN ISSUE A SUBPOENA? 

When you represent yourself in a civil action, you can’t issue a subpoena on your own.  Only a 
Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party can issue a subpoena in a civil action.   

When a party in a civil action requests a subpoena from the Clerk of Court of the North Dakota 
county where the civil action is filed, the Clerk of Court shall issue a subpoena to the party. 

NOTE: The subpoena will be signed by the clerk, but will otherwise be blank.  The party 
requesting the subpoena must complete the subpoena before arranging for service of 
the subpoena. 

The Clerk of Court may require you to provide your own subpoena document for the 
Clerk of Court to sign. 

WHAT IS THE COST OF A SUBPOENA? 

The Clerk of Court charges a fee for issuing a subpoena in a civil action.  The fee is $10.00.

Subpoena Civil Actions /Rev. Sep 2021 

WHO CAN REQUEST A SUBPOENA FROM THE CLERK OF COURT? 

A party to a civil action can request that the Clerk of Court of the North Dakota county where 
the civil action is filed issue a subpoena. 

Contact information for Clerk of Court by North Dakota county is available at 
ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

WHEN CAN A PARTY TO A CIVIL ACTION REQUEST A SUBPOENA? 

A party to a civil action can request a subpoena from the Clerk of Court after: 

1.  The summons and complaint, summons and petition, or other initiating document of 

the civil action is filed with the court; and 

2.  A civil case number is assigned. 

For information about filing a civil action in North Dakota District Court, review the “Filing 
Documents with the District Court” section of the Guide to a Civil Action, which is available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking on the Guide to Civil Action link. 

WHAT INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO REQUEST AND PREPARE A SUBPOENA? 

Before you request a subpoena, gather the following information (a printable checklist is 
available at the end of this informational guide): 

•  Names of the parties in the civil action, as listed in the caption of the summons and/or 

•  The name of court where the civil action is filed, including the judicial district and North 

complaint/petition; 

Dakota county; 

•  The civil case number; 

•  Name and address of the person to whom the subpoena is directed; 

If the subpoena will require the person’s attendance, the date, time and place of the 
deposition, hearing or trial; 

If the subpoena will require the person’s attendance at a deposition, the method of 
recording testimony; 

• 

• 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Subpoena Civil Actions /Rev. Sep 2021 

• 

If the subpoena will require the person’s attendance, the amount of the witness fees, 
mileage and travel expenses; 

NOTE: If the subpoena requires the person’s attendance and you do not include 
payment of one day’s witness fees, mileage and travel expenses with the 
subpoena, the person does not need to obey the subpoena. 

•  A list of the specific documents, electronically stored information or tangible things, if 

the subpoena will require their production; 

•  The address of the premises, if the subpoena will require inspection. 

IMPORTANT: You have a duty to take reasonable steps to avoid imposing an undue burden on a 
person subject to a subpoena.  The court must enforce this duty and may impose sanctions on 
you, the party responsible for the subpoena. 

IS THERE ANY OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE SUBPOENA? 

Depending on your circumstances, you may need to include additional information in your 
subpoena.  Review Rule 45 carefully to meet any additional requirements.   

NOTE: If your subpoena requires only pre-trial or prehearing production of documents, 
electronically stored information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises, the 
text of the notice in Rule 45(f) must be included in the subpoena.  The text of the Rule 
45(f) notice, as of September 29, 2021, is: 

“You may object to this subpoena by sending or delivering a written objection, stating 
your valid reason, to [Insert the name and address of the party, or attorney representing 
the party seeking production of documents, electronically stored information, or tangible 
things or the inspection of premises]. Any objection must be received within ten days 
after you receive the subpoena. If the time specified in the subpoena for compliance is 
less than ten days, any objection must be received at least 24 hours before the time 
specified for compliance. 

If you make a timely objection, you do not need to comply with this subpoena unless the 
court orders otherwise. You will be notified if the party serving the subpoena seeks a 
court order compelling compliance with this subpoena. You will then have the 
opportunity to contest enforcement. 

Failure to obey this subpoena, without making a timely objection, and stating a valid 
reason, may be contempt of court.”

WHEN IS NOTICE REQUIRED BEFORE THE SUBPOENA IS SERVED? 

There are situations where notice must be served before the actual subpoena can be served.   

Review Rule 45(b) carefully to determine if you must prepare and arrange for service of notice 
before you can arrange for service of the actual subpoena. 

•  Rule 27, Rule 30 and Rule 34 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure include 
requirements for notice of deposition and notice of demand for production or 
inspection.  Other Rules may apply. 

If you determine notice is required, see Rule 5(b) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure 
for the ways notice of the subpoena can be served.  You’ll need to arrange for service of the 
notice document. 

General information about Rule 5 service requirements can be found at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/service-in-a-civil-action by reviewing the document titled “Information and Instructions for 
Service After a Civil Action Has Been Started.”  A variety of General-Use affidavit of service 
forms are also available by clicking on the link. 

HOW IS THE SUBPOENA SERVED? 

The party who requested the subpoena arranges for service of the subpoena on the person to 
whom the subpoena is directed. 

NOTE: If the subpoena requires the person’s attendance and you don’t include payment 
of one day’s witness fees, mileage and travel expenses with the subpoena, the person 
doesn’t need to obey the subpoena. 

EXCEPTION: If the fees, mileage and travel expenses will be paid by the state or a 
political subdivision, you don’t need to include payment with the subpoena. 

Subpoenas must be served by one of the options in Rule 4(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  Review Rule 4(d) carefully! 

General information about Rule 4 service requirements can be found at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/service-in-a-civil-action by reviewing the document titled “Information and Instructions for 
Service to Start a Civil Action.”  A variety of General-Use affidavit of service forms are also 
available by clicking on the link.

WHAT IF THE PERSON IS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF NORTH DAKOTA? 

If a party in a North Dakota state court case needs to arrange for service of a subpoena on a 
non-party located outside of North Dakota, they may need to work with the state court where 
the non-party is located. 

Contact the state court of the state in which the non-party is located and ask about the process 
for issuing a foreign subpoena for service.  The process may also be called domesticating a 
foreign subpoena. 

In general, this process involves submitting the North Dakota subpoena to the state court of the 
state in which the non-party is located and the state court issuing a subpoena for service within 
the state. 

If the state court of the state in which the non-party is located doesn’t have information about 
the process, contact a law library in that state, or contact a lawyer licensed to practice in that 
state.  If you contact a lawyer, be aware you may need to retain the lawyer. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center can’t provide any assistance with court processes in courts of 
other states and doesn’t have information available. 

WHAT DUTIES DOES A PERSON HAVE WHEN RESPONDING TO A SUBPOENA? 

A person who is served a subpoena has certain duties when they respond to the subpoena, 
depending on the contents of the subpoena. 

Review Rule 45(d) carefully to determine the duties that apply. 

The court may hold a person in contempt if they don’t have an adequate excuse for disobeying 
the subpoena. 

NOTE: If the subpoena requires the person’s attendance and the party responsible for 
the subpoena doesn’t include payment of one day’s witness fees, mileage and travel 
expenses with the subpoena, the person doesn’t need to obey the subpoena. 

(This space left intentionally blank.) 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 7 of 10 

Subpoena Civil Actions /Rev. Sep 2021 

DOES A PERSON RESPONDING TO A SUBPOENA HAVE ANY PROTECTIONS? 

Yes, Rule 45(c) provides a number of protections to a person who was served a subpoena.  The 
protections include: 

•  The party responsible for the subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing 

an undue burden or expense on the person subject to the subpoena. 

•  The person may ask the court to quash (stop) or modify the subpoena. 

•  When a subpoena requires production of documents, electronically stored information, 
or tangible things, or to permit inspection of premises, but doesn’t also require the 
person to appear, the person isn’t required to appear at the deposition, hearing or trial. 

•  The person may object in writing to inspection, copying, testing, or sampling any or all of 
the commands in a subpoena for production of documents or tangible things, or to 
permit inspection of premises. 

•  North Dakota residents may only be required to attend depositions in the county where 
the person resides, is employed or transacts business.  However, the court may order 
attendance at a convenient place. 

•  North Dakota residents may be required to attend a hearing or trial any place within 

North Dakota. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE EXAMPLES OF SUBPOENA 
DOCUMENTS? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have examples of subpoenas or related documents.  
However, Legal Services of North Dakota has an online Family Law Manual that includes an 
example of a subpoena and an example of a notice of deposition. 

The Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual is found at legalassist.org by clicking on 
the “Self Help Forms” link, then the “Family Law Manual” link.

sufficiency of the forms in the Family Law Manual.  Use at your own risk.)

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
