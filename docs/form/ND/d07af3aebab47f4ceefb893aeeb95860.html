      <pre>Instructions to Make a Motion to Hold a Hearing by Reliable Electronic 
Means or Appear at the Hearing by Reliable Electronic Means 

Important! Read Before Using this Packet of Forms. 

ND Legal Self Help staff and court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). If you’re 
unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about finding a 
lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota Juvenile Court to hold a hearing in a juvenile court case by 
reliable electronic means, or to allow you, the child, another party, or a witness to appear at a 
hearing by reliable electronic means. There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept 
forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the forms or information provided.  

Use these forms and instructions at your own risk. 

NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 1 of 7]  

Instructions/Jan 2023 

Rule 52 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules gives the requirements for 
making a motion to ask a Juvenile Court to hold a hearing by reliable electronic means, or 
allow you, the child, or another party or witness to appear at the hearing by reliable 
electronic means, instead of in person. 

•  Review Rule 52 carefully! Effective December 1, 2022, Rule 52 doesn’t require a notice 

of motion or a supporting brief. 

What is a Motion to Conduct a Hearing or Appear by Reliable 
Electronic Means? 

Often, hearings in Juvenile Court cases are held in a courthouse. This means that all of the 
people who are required to appear at the hearing must go to the courthouse in-person. 

However, when anyone required to appear at the hearing has a reason (or reasons) they can’t 
go to the courthouse in person, they may ask the Juvenile Court for permission to: 

1.  Hold the hearing by reliable electronic means, instead of in-person at the courthouse; or 
2.  Allow you, another party, or witness to appear at the hearing by reliable electronic 

means, instead of in-person at the courthouse. 

Examples of reliable electronic means include, but aren’t limited to, Zoom, telephone, or 
Interactive Video Network (IVN). 

The court decides whether to hold the hearing by reliable electronic means, or to allow a party, 
the child, or their witness(es) to appear by reliable electronic means. 

The Petitioner, the Child’s Parent, the Child’s Guardian, or the Child’s 
Custodian May Make this Motion 

The petitioner, the child’s parent, the child’s guardian, or the child’s custodian in a Juvenile 
Court case may use this set of forms to ask the court for either option or both options and to 
explain their preference to the court. 

The person using this set of forms is also called the Moving Party. 

The other people who are required to appear at the hearing are called the Non-moving Parties. 
(Also called the Opposing Parties.) The Non-moving Parties may choose to respond in writing to 
this motion. 

NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 2 of 7]  

Instructions/Jan 2023 

Before You Start, You Must Try to Contact the Non-moving Parties! 

Before you serve or file the Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic 
Means, you must attempt to contact the Non-moving Parties to find out if they agree or object 
to your motion. 

Carefully review Paragraph 4 of Form 1: Motion. Paragraph 4 lists the people who are required 
to receive notice of hearing in a Juvenile Court case. The people you need to attempt to contact 
will depend on the circumstances of the case. 

You can still make your motion even if you’re unable to contact all of the Non-moving Parties, 
or if any Non-moving Parties object to your motion. You’ll use Form 1: Motion to tell the court 
if you were able to contact each Non-moving Party and, if so, whether they agree or disagree. 

What Are the Deadlines for this Motion? 

The Moving Party must serve the motion documents on all other parties at least seven (7) 
days before the hearing, trial, or other proceeding. 

•

See Step 2 on Pages 6-7 for information about service.

If a Non-moving Party chooses to respond, they must serve their written response to the 
motion at least four (4) days before the hearing, trial, or other proceeding. 

• Non-moving Parties may choose not to respond. The Juvenile Court will make a decision

based on the documents filed by the Moving Party.

These time requirements may be shortened by the Juvenile Court if you have a good reason, 
or reasons. This is also referred to as having good cause. 

If a Moving Party wants to make a request to shorten the time requirements, Form 1: Motion 
includes the option to make this request.

Paragraph 1: Tell the court who you are. Put a checkmark  in the appropriate box. Choose 
only one. 

Paragraph 2: You have the option of asking the court to shorten the time requirement for 
making your motion. (See the Deadlines section on Page 3.) Put a checkmark  in the 
appropriate box. Choose only one. 

If you’re asking the court to shorten the time the requirement, state the reasons why.

NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 4 of 7] 

Instructions/Jan 2023 

Paragraph 4: Tell the court who you attempted to contact before you filled out the forms for 
this motion. Read 4.a. and 4.b. carefully. Put a checkmark  in the appropriate boxes. 

Paragraph 5: List the names of every person you checkmarked in Paragraph 4 and their

• DON’T fill in any of the remaining information for Paragraph 2. If the judge or judicial

referee uses your proposed order, the judge or judicial referee will fill in this
information.

Signature:  DON’T sign this form. If the judge or judicial referee uses your proposed order, the 
judge or judicial referee will date and sign the form. 

Step 2 – Serve Completed Form 1 and Form 2 on All Other Parties. 

Service is providing copies of your completed motion documents to all Non-moving Parties. The 
Juvenile Court won’t act on your motion documents until you file proof of service with the 
court.  A declaration of service gives the Juvenile Court proof of service. 

Make at least two copies of the following completed forms: 

•
•

Form 1: Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic Means; and
Form 2: Order on Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic Means
(Proposed).

Keep one copy for your records. You’ll arrange to serve the other copy or copies on all other 
Non-moving Parties. You’ll file the original with the Clerk of Court in Step 3. 

Arrange to serve the copies on all other Non-moving parties by mail: 

Put the copies in an envelope.

•
• Address the envelope with the Non-moving Party’s last known address.
•

If you know the Non-moving Party is currently represented by a lawyer, address the
envelope with the lawyer’s address.
List your address as the return address on the envelope.
Put the correct first class postage on the envelope.

•
•

o Postage must be prepaid.
o It’s very important to put the correct postage on the envelope. If you don’t, the
envelope may be returned to you causing you to miss the service deadline.

Service by mail is complete upon mailing.

•

•

The person who mailed the envelope(s) completes the following form: 

Form 3: Declaration of Service by Mail.

NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 6 of 7] 

Instructions/Jan 2023 

The person who mailed the envelope must complete the Declaration of Service by Mail form.  
(If the envelope is mailed at a United States Post Office, the United States Post Office employee 
doesn’t complete Declaration of Service by Mail form.) 

Complete the Caption exactly as you filled in the caption of Form 1: Motion. 

Follow the directions on the form.

•
• Make ONE COPY of the completed, dated, and signed Declaration of Service by Mail

form for your records.

You’ll file the original Declaration of Service by Mail with the Clerk of Court in Step 3. 

Service by mail is a common way to serve motion documents. However, there are other ways 
to serve your documents. 

To the review other service options, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-juvenile-
action. Scroll to the “Service After a Juvenile Court  Action Has Started” section of the webpage. 

Step 3 – File the Original Forms with the Clerk of Court. 

File the following original, completed forms with the Clerk of Court. 

•
•

•

Form 1: Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic Means;
Form 2: Order on Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic Means
(Proposed); and
Form 3: Declaration of Service for each Non-moving Party served.

If any Non-moving Parties choose to respond in writing, you’ll be served a written response to 
your motion.  

You’ll be notified by the Juvenile Court if your motion is granted or denied. 

If your motion is granted, you must work with the Juvenile Court to get everything arranged for 
the appearance by reliable electronic means.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
