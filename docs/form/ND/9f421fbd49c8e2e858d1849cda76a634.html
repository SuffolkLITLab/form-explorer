OVERVIEW OF SEALING NORTH DAKOTA CRIMINAL RECORDS 

What is sealing criminal records? 

The Sixty-sixth Legislative Assembly of North Dakota (2019-2020) enacted new laws related to 
sealing North Dakota criminal records.  The new laws were signed by the Governor and became 
effective August 1, 2019. 

The new laws are found in Chapter 12-60.1 of the North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.). 

If criminal records are sealed using the N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 process, disclosure of the 
existence or content of the criminal records is prohibited. 

IMPORTANT!  Certain criminal records reported to the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal 

Investigation (BCI) cannot be sealed.  Keep reading for more information. 

Can I have my DUI criminal records sealed under N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1? 

No , DUI criminal records cannot be sealed using the N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 process.  This 

research guide does not include information about sealing DUI records. 

To start your legal research into sealing DUI criminal records, see N.D.C.C. Section 39-08-01.6. 

How is sealing criminal records different from expunging criminal records? 

In general, expungement of criminal records is deletion and destruction of all record 
information. 

In North Dakota, expungement of criminal records is available only in limited circumstances. 

See the Expungement of Criminal Records research guide at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 
for more information.  Scroll to the “Miscellaneous” section. 

Where do I file a petition to seal my criminal records? 

You file your petition in the existing criminal case for the offense. 

IMPORTANT!  The existing criminal case must be either a North Dakota municipal court case or 

a North Dakota state district court case.

NDCC Ch. 12-60.1/Rev 11 8 2019 

How does N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 define criminal records? 

N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 states that criminal records include both court records and 
prosecution records. 

Court records include: 

•  Any documents or information collected, received, or maintained by court personnel in 

connection with a judicial proceeding; 

•  Any index, calendar, docket, register of actions, official record of the proceedings, order, 
decree, judgment, minute, and any information in a case management system created 
or prepared by court personnel relating to a judicial proceeding; and 

• 

Information maintained by court personnel pertaining to the administration of the court 
or clerk of court office and not associated with a particular case. 

N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 does not specifically define the types of records that are considered 
prosecution records. 

However, N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 does define Prosecutor to mean: 

•  The office or agency with jurisdiction over the offense for purposes of post-conviction 

proceedings. 

Certain criminal records reported to the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) 
cannot be sealed 

Under N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1, certain criminal records cannot be sealed: 

•  Criminal history record information reported to the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal 

Investigation (BCI) cannot be sealed, which includes: 

o 

Information collected by criminal justice agencies on individuals consisting of 
identifiable descriptions and notations of arrests, detentions, indictments, 
information, or other criminal charges, any dispositions arising therefrom, 
sentencing, correctional supervision, and release. 

•  Criminal justice data information maintained in the Criminal Justice Data Information 

Sharing System cannot be sealed.  The Criminal Justice Data Information Sharing System 
is part of BCI. 

After criminal records are sealed, can they be un-sealed? 

Yes, a court may order the disclosure of the sealed criminal records.

NDCC Ch. 12-60.1/Rev 11 8 2019 

Who may file a petition to have their criminal records sealed? 

Under N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1, the following may petition a North Dakota state court to seal 
their criminal records: 

•  An individual who pled guilty to or was found guilty of a misdemeanor offense and the 
individual has not been charged with a new crime for at least three years from the date 
of release from incarceration, parole, or probation. 

•  An individual who pled guilty to or was found guilty of a felony offense and the 

individual has not been charged with a new crime for at least five years from the date of 
release from incarceration, parole, or probation. 

Who cannot file a petition to have their criminal records sealed? 

Under N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1, the following cannot petition a North Dakota state court to 
seal their criminal records: 

• 

• 

Individuals with felony offenses involving violence or intimidation during the period in 
which the individual is ineligible to possess a firearm under N.D.C.C. Section 62.1-02-
01(1)(a): 

o  Ten years after the date of conviction or the date of release from incarceration, 

parole, or probation, whichever is latest. 

Individuals with an offense for which the individual has been ordered to register under 
N.D.C.C. Section 12.1-32-15: 

o  Offenders against children and sexual offenders. 

DUI criminal records cannot be sealed using the N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 process.  See N.D.C.C. 
Section 39-08-01.6 for laws related to sealing DUI criminal records. 

What does the court consider when deciding whether to grant my petition to seal my criminal 
records? 

When deciding whether to seal your criminal records, the court must consider the following: 

•  The nature and severity of the underlying crime that would be sealed; 

•  The risk you pose to society; 

•  The length of time since you committed the offense; 

•  Your rehabilitation since the offense; 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 4 of 15 

NDCC Ch. 12-60.1/Rev 11 8 2019 

•  Aggravating or mitigating factors relating to the underlying crime, including factors 
outlined in N.D.C.C. Section 12.1-32-04 (factors considered in sentencing decisions); 

•  Your criminal record, employment history, and community involvement; 

•  The recommendations of law enforcement, prosecutors, corrections officials, and those 

familiar with the petitioner and the offense; and 

•  The recommendations of victims of the offense. 

If the court denies my petition to seal my criminal records, how long do I have to wait before I 
can petition the court again? 

If your petition to seal your criminal records is denied by the court, you must wait three years 
to file another petition. 

However, if you filed your petition in a North Dakota municipal court, you may appeal the 
denial to a North Dakota state district court. 

If the court denies my petition to seal my criminal records, can I appeal the denial? 

Maybe.  Appeal options are limited when a petition to seal criminal records is denied. 

Petitions denied by a North Dakota state district court judge or North Dakota state district court 
magistrate may not be appealed. 

Only a denial by a North Dakota municipal court may be appealed to a North Dakota state 
district court. 

• 

If the district court judge or magistrate does not reverse the municipal court’s denial, 
the denial is final.  You must wait three years before you can petition again.

You must prove by clear and convincing evidence that: 

•  You have good cause for the court to grant your petition. 

•  The benefit to you outweighs the presumption of openness of the criminal record. 

•  You have completed all terms of imprisonment and probation for the offense. 

•  You have paid all restitution ordered by the court for commission of the offense. 

•  You have demonstrated reformation warranting relief. 

•  Your petition complies with the requirements of N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1. 

The court must also consider the following when making the decision: 

•  The nature and severity of the underlying crime that would be sealed; 

•  The risk you pose to society; 

•  The length of time since you committed the offense; 

•  Your rehabilitation since the offense; 

•  Aggravating or mitigating factors relating to the underlying crime, including factors 
outlined in N.D.C.C. Section 12.1-32-04 (factors considered in sentencing decisions); 

•  Your criminal record, employment history, and community involvement; 

•  The recommendations of law enforcement, prosecutors, corrections officials, and those 

familiar with the petitioner and the offense; and 

•  The recommendations of victims of the offense.

The Respondent may challenge your evidence and present their own evidence to disprove your 
evidence. 

Caution! Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. You are held to the same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or 
procedures. You will need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

At minimum, review and research the laws and rules listed above.  You will use the North 
Dakota Rules of Evidence, in particular, to present your evidence and object to the 
respondent’s evidence. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

Attend the Hearing 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you will need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Do not miss your hearing date and time. If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you cannot 
get to court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the courthouse as soon as you can.  

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge hears both sides and then issues a final judgment.  Sometimes, the final judgment is 
issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final judgment is issued at a later date.  

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the petitioner goes first. 

•  You Present Witnesses and Evidence 

o  You present your case first. 
o  The Respondent may cross-examine witnesses and object to your evidence. 

•  Respondent Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The respondent presents their case after you. 
o  You may cross-examine witnesses and object to the respondent’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Respondent goes first.

The judge will decide if you proved the grounds for sealing your criminal records.  If the judge 
decides you proved the grounds, the judge will order that the criminal records allowed to be 
sealed under N.D.C.C. Chapter 12-60.1 be sealed. 

Before You Leave the Courthouse:  

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you are not sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

ATTORNEY RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

You are not required to hire an attorney to access the state court system.  If you decide to 
represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that an attorney is 
required to follow. 

Attorney Resources 

If you decide to find an attorney to represent you, you may find the following options of 
interest. 

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income. Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income. The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is 
www.legalassist.org. 

•  The State Bar Association provides a lawyer referral service to match paying clients in 
need of legal services with lawyers. The phone number is (866) 450-9579 and the 
website is www.sband.org. 

•  For a list of all lawyers who are licensed to practice in North Dakota, go to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court website at www.ndcourts.gov/Lawyers.  You can narrow your 
search by name or location. 

Limited Legal Representation 

Attorneys licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an 
attorney can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the 
part of the case the attorney handled.

For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
