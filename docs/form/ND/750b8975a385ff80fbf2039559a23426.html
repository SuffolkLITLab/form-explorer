VOLUME 49 ∙ NUMBER 3 ∙ MARCH 2019

NDLCC CORNER
The  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating 
Council  (NDLCC)  held  a  special  meeting  via 
Zoom  on  March  8th.  They  reviewed  the  list 
of  grant  applicants  for  the  Non-Competitive 
Computer Grant. They received 46 applications 
requesting $42,886, and the Council awarded 
a  total  of  $37,598.  Each  library  that  applied 
will receive a grant, although not all libraries 
received the full amount requested based on 
limited funds. 

The  NDLCC  appointed  a  subcommittee  last 
year to  work with Library Development on a 
revision to the Standards for Public Libraries. 
We will be releasing those for public feedback 
by  the  beginning  of  April.  The  goal  is  to  
have  the  new  standards  approved  at  the 
NDLCC meeting in May. A huge thank you to 
the  2018-19  Standards  Revision  Task  Force, 
led  by  Committee  Chair  Trevor  Martinson, 
Library  Development  Staff  Eric  Stroshane 
and  Abby  Ebach,  and  committee  members: 
Angela  Julita,  Lakota  City  Library;  Jackie 
Hawes,  Morton  Mandan  Public  Library;  Joe 
Rector,  James  River  Valley  Library  System; 
MaLynda  Kramber,  Garrison  Public  Library; 
Sandra  Hannahs,  West  Fargo  Public  Library; 
Steve  Hammel,  Valley  City  Barnes  County

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

January 6 was my five year anniversary as the North Dakota 
State  Librarian  and  this  year  also  marks  my  25th  year  as 
a librarian. I’ve been reflecting lately on the changes I’ve 
seen over the years. I started my professional career as a 
Youth  Services  Librarian,  serving  ages  birth  to  18  plus 
their parents/caregivers and supporting the local schools. 
I loved everything about being a YS Librarian. My favorite 
part was when I connected a reader with a book or a new 
author. My second favorite part was programming. I love 
planning and implementing library programs for all ages. 

In  addition  to  being  a  YS  Librarian,  I  was  a  school 
librarian  for  a  year  and  then  served  as  the  School  and 
Youth  Services  Consultant  for  a  Regional  Library  System 
in  Illinois.  I  loved  that  position  as  well.  I  worked  with 
School and Youth Services, Children’s and Teen Librarians, 
providing  assistance,  continuing  education,  program 
support  and  answered  reference  questions.  Very  similar 
to what our Library Development Department does, just 
geared at a more focused library population. My favorite 
thing  about  that  position  was  getting  out  and  visiting 
libraries; I also enjoyed the variety in my days. My absolute 
favorite annual events was the Summer Reading Program 
workshops. In Illinois, most public libraries use IREAD for 
the summer reading program theme and materials; similar 
to  CSLP  but  created  and  implemented  by  the  Illinois 
Library  Community.  I  can  remember  being  16  years  old 
and accompanying Miss Pam, the Youth Services Librarian 
at  my  local  library,  as  she  went  to  pick  up  the  summer 
reading  materials  and  prizes  at  the  Regional  Library 
System. Oh my was I excited, and yes, a little nerdy.

Following  my  position  at  the  Heritage  Trails  Library 
System,  I  began  my  first  position  as  a  library  director  at 
the Wilmington Public Library District (WPLD). WPLD was 
a small library by Illinois standards, serving a population 
just over 9,100 people. I remember how nervous I was for 
my first board meeting. I also remember that the first time 
I completed the IPLAR, or public library annual report, my 
numbers all went down. I can recall when Mary D from the 
Illinois State Library called me to ask about my responses 
since they were all very different than the previous years; 
circulation  went  down  by  almost  half.  I  did  not  want  to 
present the year to year stats with my Board and I was really 
worried about what their reaction would be. Fortunately, 
they were happy to have good solid data being reported 
and  that  first  tough  hurdle  was  crossed.  When  I  tell  our 
public  librarians  that  I  really  understand  their  thoughts 
and feelings about the annual report, I’m being sincere as I 
filled that same report out for 13 years in Illinois. 

My next library adventure took me to a director’s position 
at  a  larger  library,  although  still  on  the  smallish  side  by 
Illinois  standards.  Three  Rivers  Public  Library  District,  or 
TRPLD,  served  two  communities  with  a  total  population 
just over 27,000. We had a main library and a branch and 
I  worked  very  hard  to  standardize  policies,  procedures 
and  service  standards  so  that  no  matter  which  library 
our patrons went to, they received consistent service and 
answers to questions. We added teen programming while 
I was there and my son converted a magazine room to a 
new teen room as his Eagle Scout project. The room was 
on the other side of my office and there were many times 
that I wanted to put down my director’s hat and go join 
the teens in whatever fun program they were participating 
in. I did have the pleasure of chaperoning a few teen lock-
ins while at TRPLD. These were so much fun, even the one 
where we had to wipe baby powder off the bookshelves 
after using tube socks filled with it for Zombie Tag. 

Many  things  have  changed  about  libraries  since  I  was  a 
baby librarian. I miss the card catalogs and love when I visit 
a library that still has one. I have two in my house now and 
we’re trying to figure out how to best use them other than 
as  conversation  pieces.  (Ideas  gladly  accepted.)  Libraries 
offer  a  wider  variety  of  programs  than  they  used  to  and 
many  self-directed  ones.  Books  are  available  in  many 
formats  and  that  also  continues  to  evolve.  I  remember 
when  e-books  first  came  out,  we  used  to  download 
collections  to  an  MP3  player  and  circulate  the  player.  I 
know when I first started in libraries we certainly couldn’t 
have  imagined  a  time  when  patrons  would  be  able  to 
access library materials 24-7 from their home computer let 
alone  from  their  mobile  phone.  At  that  time,  my  mobile 
phone was literally a car phone, in a bag that plugged into 
the cigarette lighter of the car. 

When I meet someone that doesn’t have a library card or 
hasn’t been to a library in a long time, my response is one 
of two: if you haven’t been to a library recently, you haven’t 
been  to  a  library  or  we  are  not  your  grandpa’s  library  so 
come check us out. While many things have changed about 
libraries in the last quarter of a century, one thing remains 
the same and that is that libraries are about serving their 
community and all members of the community in the same 
manner. It is my honor to be starting my second 25 years 
of librarianship in the company of so many great librarians 
across North Dakota and by serving in my favorite role yet, 
State Librarian.

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

DIGITAL HORIZONS

Digital  Horizons  was  created  to  showcase  the  heritage  of  the 
people  of  this  state  and  region. The  archive  is  a  collaborative 
effort by state agencies, universities, and libraries from across 
North  Dakota.  The  State  Library  participates  by  having  five 
separate collections in this digital archive. 

The  most  widely  added  to  and  diverse  collection  is  the  North  Dakota  Memories  collection. The 
Memories collection is comprised primarily of photographs and documents that have been digitized 
at the State Library’s ScanDays. These events provide a great opportunity for the public to interact 
with the State Library and to preserve public history at the local level. If interested in searching this 
database for images from previous ScanDays around North Dakota, you can search by time frame 
of the item, event, or location. 

Many researchers use the location function of this database so they can find where their family is 
from or what images have already been included from their area. Digital Horizons is a treasure trove 
of items that showcases North Dakota to everyone who is interested. 

If you want to learn more about Digital Horizons, ScanDays, or have any other questions, please 
email ndsl-digital@nd.gov. 

A webinar about Digital Horizons will take place on March 21. Register here.

HAPPY RETIREMENT, SUE!

If you’ve called the State Library in the past, you’ve 
probably  had  the  pleasure  of  speaking  with  Sue 
Clark at the reference desk.

Sue  began  her  career  at  the  State  Library  in  the 
Technical Services Department on February 1, 1980, 
before moving to the Reference Department, where 
she  has  devoted  her  time  to  helping  patrons  and 
librarians across the state by phone and e-mail.

Sue’s last day at the State Library will be March 29. 
We wish her a heartfelt thank you for her dedication 
to  the  patrons  and  librarians  of  North  Dakota.  She 
will be missed, but we hope that she has a great time 
on her new adventure!

Happy Retirement, Sue!

INTRODUCING A NEW KIT FROM THE  
NORTH DAKOTA STATE LIBRARY: ROLI BLOCKS

Roli BLOCKS are modular tactile electronic musical instruments and composition tools. They assist with 
learning and exploring musical concepts through computational thinking and human touch. While that 
may sound stodgy, they’re a fun, intuitive, and flexible way to make and share music with your friends. 
Roli are well-suited to create music in a variety of styles from pop and hip hop to droning ambient 
soundscapes. Each Roli kit includes two Light Blocks, a super squishy Seaboard keyboard block, and 
Live and Loop blocks to put additional controls at your fingertips. 

As with all of our STEM kits, each Roli BLOCKS kit comes with a quick 
start guide and programming ideas. Roli BLOCKS require compatible 
Apple  or  Android  devices  to  work.  Please  check  the  description  in 
KitKeeper  before  ordering  to  ensure  it  will  work  with  your  device. 
Recommended for ages 14 and up. Head over to KitKeeper to reserve 
a kit for your public or school library now.

This STEM initiative was made possible by the collaboration of the Air Force STEM Program and Grand Forks 
AFB, School Liaison Office. The mission of the Air Force K-12 STEM program is to inspire and develop student 
interest in Department of Defense STEM education and careers. The Air Force provides numerous K-12 STEM 
outreach  opportunities  to  K-12  students  both  on  Air  Force  bases  and  in  the  local  communities.  For  more 
information on AF STEM programs, visit www.afstem.org or Facebook at AirForceSTEM.

BISMARCK LIBRARY FINALIST FOR 2019 NATIONAL MEDAL  
FOR MUSEUM AND LIBRARY SERVICE

The Institute of Museum and Library Services recently announced that Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public 
Library is among the 30 finalists for the 2019 National Medal for Museum and Library Service.

“The 30 National Medal finalists showcase the tremendous ability of libraries and museums to serve as vital 
community resources,” said IMLS Director Dr.  Kathryn  K.  Matthew. “The Institute  of  Museum  and Library 
Services is honored to recognize these leading institutions. We congratulate them on the work they are 
doing across the United States.”

The  National  Medal  is  the  nation’s  highest  honor  given  to  museums  and  libraries  for  service  to  their 
communities.  For  25  years,  the  award  has  celebrated  institutions  that  demonstrate  extraordinary  and 
innovative  approaches  to  public  service  and  are  making  a  difference  for  individuals,  families,  and 
communities.  Finalists  are  chosen  because  of  their  significant  and  exceptional  contributions  to  their 
communities. Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library is the first library in ND to receive this honor.

“We  are  committed  to  serving  and  meeting  the  needs  of  our  community  through  personal  enrichment 
opportunities,”  said  Bismarck  Library  Director  Christine  Kujawa. “We  are  honored  to  be  a  2019  National 
Medal for Museum and Library Service finalist.”

National  Medal  winners  will  be  announced  later  this  spring.  Representatives  from  winning  institutions  
will  be  honored  for  their  extraordinary  contributions  at  the  National  Medal  Ceremony  on  June  12  in

MARCH 2019

By Jessica Robinson

As Captain Marvel busts her way up the box office 
this  month,  let’s  take  a  moment  to  look  at  some 
of  the  great  graphic  novels  available  in  2019. We’ll 
start with the January and February releases before 
adding  a  few  titles  to  our  pull  list  for  the  rest  of  
the year.

Day one of January started off strong with Natalie 
Nourigat’s I Moved to Los Angeles to Work in Animation, 
a beautiful autobiographical comic that takes readers 
inside  the  risky  world  of  professional  animation. 
Debbie Tung brought us Book Love on the same day, 
which is an adorable tribute to fulltime bibliomania. 
On  January  15,  Cecil  Castellucci  followed  another 
superheroine making her mark as the new face of a 
legacy character in Shade, the Changing Woman. This 
is a title from DC’s soon-to-be defunct Young Animal 
imprint,  which  was  developed  in  collaboration 
with  The  Umbrella Academy’s  Gerard Way.  Readers 
looking  to  get  their  dystopian  fix  should  check 
out Aleš Kot’s The New World, collected in a single 
volume on January 22, which follows the romantic 
misadventures of a vegan hacker and a maverick cop 
following the Second Civil War. Finally, on January 29, 
Erik  Burnhaum  created  the  ultimate  Ghostbusters 
team  with  Ghostbusters:  Crossing  Over,  a  huge 
multidimensional story featuring Ghostbusters from 
the original movies, the 2016 remake, and more.

2018  was  the  150th  anniversary  of  Louisa  May 
Alcott’s beloved Little Women but there’s no reason 
to stop the celebration in 2019. Rey Terciero and Bre 
Indigo’s Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy came out on February 
5th  and  once  again  tells  the  story  of  the  March 
family, this time as a blended family living in modern 
day New York City. The Long Con by Dylan Meconis 
came out on February 12 and tells the story of the 
apocalypse—which  happened  everywhere  except 
at the world’s largest pop culture convention. Kevin 
Panetta  and  Savanna  Ganucheau’s  Bloom  came  out 
the same day and is a sweet exploration of identity 
and romance when a baker’s wannabe rockstar son 
falls  in  love  with  his  potential  replacement  at  the 

family  bakery  just  when  he’s  finally  ready  to  leave. 
Tom King is one of the best comic book writers in 
the  business  today,  and  Mister  Miracle,  released  on 
February  19th,  shows  exactly  why.  Mister  Miracle 
a.k.a. Scott Free is the world’s greatest escape artist 
and  the  adopted  son  of  the  most  evil  man  in  the 
DC multiverse, two things that come to head when 
his father discovers a weapon that forces Scott to 
abandon his happy life on Earth and return to the 
terrifying prison he came from. Finally, on February 
26,  Lucy  Knisley  released  a  deeply  personal  and 
often  hilarious  memoir  of  her  difficult  journey 
towards motherhood in Kid Gloves: Nine Months of 
Careful Chaos.

Now, we turn to the future with Catwoman, Volume 1: 
Copycats by Joelle Jones on April 16th. Catwoman’s 
wedding to Batman didn’t go exactly as she’s always 
dreamed,  so  Gotham  City’s  greatest  cat  burglar  is 
focusing on her new family business as she attempts 
to track down a thief copying her old crimes. Ryan 
Andrews releases This Was Our Pact on June 11th, a 
magical  story  of  unexpected  friendship  when  two 
schoolmates  follow  the  paper  lanterns  released 
into the river during their town’s Autumn Equinox 
Festival. I’m particularly excited to read the graphic 
novel  collaboration  of  Rainbow  Rowell  and  Faith 
Erin  Hicks,  coming  out August  27th. The  name  is 
Pumpkinheads and it’s about two seasonal workers 
at  the  world’s  greatest  pumpkin  patch  (in  Omaha, 
Nebraska)  who  decide  to  have  one  last  great 
adventure together during their senior year of high 
school. On September 3rd, Carly Usdin and Noah 
Hayes  throw  their  hats  into  the  popular  world

WHAT’S DIFFERENT ABOUT NICHE ACADEMY?

As  we  announced  in  last  month’s  Flickertale,  we  now 
have a new database called Niche Academy. Currently, 
you  can  access  this  database  by  clicking  on  the  blue 
“Tutorials”  button  on  the  databases  page.  Once  
through  the  databases  page,  you  come  to  a  landing 
page  of  in-depth  tutorials  for  the  databases  that  the  
State Library subscribes to. If you click on “Categories” on the right hand side of the page you open up 
a list of categories of videos. Each category comes with its own link that you can use in your website 
if you choose. There are videos on Social Media or Computer Basics, Library 101s, New Director, and  
more. Each category has been organized with our different libraries in mind. 

As we continue to develop this great resources check out the future issues of the Flickertale for more 
information on the different features and ways this database can be used!

USDA AND RURAL LIBRARIES
Submitted by Mike Stepien in USDA Office of Rural Development

   

MARCH 2019

North  Dakota  libraries  provide  learning  opportunities  for  citizens  throughout  the  state  and  are  integral 
in  ensuring  information  is  available  without  a  cost  to  members  of  our  communities.  With  such  a  large 
percentage  of  North  Dakota  residents  spread  across  rural  towns,  it  is  imperative  libraries  in  these  areas 
remain  capable  of  providing  this  critical  service. We  must  keep  these  valuable  community  assets  at  the 
forefront of service to their communities. If you are aware of a library located in a rural community needing 
some assistance, the federal government may be able to help.

USDA Rural Development has six offices across the state and has low-interest loan and grant money available 
for rural communities. From affordable housing loans for low-income families to business grants for aspiring 
entrepreneurs, USDA Rural Development has significantly contributed to economic development across 
North Dakota. Their community facilities programs are available to fund various types of projects critical to 
rural towns, including libraries.

Recently, the Alfred Dickey Free Public Library in Jamestown celebrated the completion of a renovation 
project. Multiple aspects of the building needed serious rehabilitation, including significant repairs to the 
building foundation. Partnerships were formed to collect funds for the project, and one of those partners was 
USDA Rural Development. The agency contributed over $75,000 in grant money, ensuring the renovation 
project had acquired the necessary capital to launch the process of improving the building.

The building is on solid ground and ready to serve the citizens for another 100 years. This building renovation 
is not the first time USDA has provided funding for libraries in North Dakota.

In addition to Jamestown, USDA Rural Development has also provided funding to libraries in Rugby and 
Lakota. Rugby utilized the funding to make the library ADA compliant, adding an elevator and an accessible 
restroom. An individual in a wheelchair was previously unable to attend the children’s story hour in the 
basement, and this upgrade provided access to meet with peers in the children’s reading area.

USDA  welcomes  inquiries  regarding  the  potential  to  fund  additional  libraries  across  North  Dakota,  and 
there is also funding available for various community facilities. Please contact Mark Wax at 701-530-2029 
or mark.wax@nd.usda.gov if you have any questions. Also, if you’re interested in other ways the USDA can 
provide assistance to rural North Dakota, visit their website at https://www.rd.usda.gov/nd.

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT: READERS ADVISORY CHALLENGE
Submitted by Abby Ebach

urn  the  tables  during  your  summer  reading  program,  and  challenge  yourself  to  find  a  book  that 
everyone will enjoy. Karen Jensen from Teen Librarian Toolbox once made a deal with her teens that 
she could find a book that they would enjoy by the end of the summer or else she would buy them a 
Slurpee (with their own money). The rules? She would provide them 5 books at a time of which they 
had to choose three to read at least 30 pages of. They had to be honest with her about what they liked 
and didn’t like before she would recommend more. She didn’t use any traditional Readers Advisory 
sites  or  lists  to  assist  her,  but  tried  to  rely  on  what  her  young  patrons  were  asking  her  for.  She  was 
allowed three tries before admitting defeat.

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR THE 
NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW (COURT OPINIONS)
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This is the sixth in a series of Flickertale articles that 
aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s legal 
reference resources. 

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The Flickertale. 

The case name lists the Plaintiff first, then “v.”, then 
the Defendant last. If there is more than one Plaintiff, 
the case name will usually list only the first Plaintiff. 
If there is more than one Defendant, the case name 
will usually list only the first Defendant.

Next month’s article will get into more detail about 
legal  research  resources  for  North  Dakota’s  court 
rules.  Court  rules  are  the  procedural  rules  that 
govern how a civil or criminal matter makes its way 
to court and how the dispute is conducted.

NEW  ONLINE  LEGAL  RESEARCH  RESOURCES 
FROM THE LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER

A  new “Legal  Research”  section  was  added  to  the 
recently  updated  North  Dakota  Legal  Self  Help 
Center website.

The “How  to  Research Your  Legal  Issue”  link  in  the 
new section includes an overview of the process, a 
printable  Legal  Research  Guide  and  Checklist,  and 
references to a variety of legal research resources. 

WHAT IS CASE LAW?

When  a  final  decision  of  a  case  is  appealed  from  a 
North Dakota state district court to the North Dakota 
Supreme  Court,  the  Supreme  Court  writes  their 
opinion  to  explain  how  and  why  they  interpreted 
the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they 
did. The opinions are case law and are followed by 
North Dakota state courts deciding later cases with 
similar facts and issues.

Case  law  is  a  very  useful  resource  for  researching 
what a law means. The North Dakota Supreme Court 
regularly  interprets  what  the  laws  mean  as  part  of 
deciding appeals in civil and criminal cases.

Citations to Case Law

To  research  case  law,  patrons  will  need  to  identify 
the name and citation for the opinion.

North Dakota Supreme Court opinions are assigned 
a citation to the North Western Reporter. The citation 
to the opinion will include either “N.W.” or “N.W.2d”. 
See below for more information and examples.

Beginning January 1, 1997, North Dakota Supreme 
Court opinions were also assigned a public domain 
citation.  The  first  set  of  numbers  is  the  year  the 
opinion was decided, followed by “ND”. The second 
set  of  numbers  indicates  the  chronological  order 
that  the  opinion  was  decided.  For  example,  the 
public  domain  citation  for  Bindas  v.  Bindas,  which 
was decided in 2019, is 2019 ND 56.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW PRINT RESEARCH 
RESOURCES:

North  Dakota  Century  Code  Case  Law  (Notes  to 
Decisions section)

If a law within the North Dakota Century Code has 
related case law, snapshots of the opinions are listed 
in the Notes to Decisions section.

Notes  to  Decisions  are  only  available  in  the  print 
version of the North Dakota Century Code.

To view the full opinion, a patron will need to use a 
different print or online legal research resource.

North Western Reporter

The North Western Reporter, published by Thomson 
Reuters  (West),  contains  case  law  from  courts  of 
Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, 
South  Dakota,  and  Wisconsin.  The  North  Western 
Reporter is currently in its second series.

The North Western Reporter is not indexed by topic. 
Opinions  are  published  in  the  chronological  order 
they were decided. 

The Dakota Digest is available in print at the North 
Dakota Supreme Court Law Library.

Opinions cited in the second series include “N.W.2d” 
sandwiched  between  two  sets  of  numbers.  For 
example,  the  citation  for  a  recent  North  Dakota 
Supreme Court opinion, State v. Bearrunner, is 921 
N.W.2d 894 (N.D. 2019).

Opinions  cited  in  the  first  series  include  “N.W.” 
sandwiched  between  two  sets  of  numbers.  For 
example,  the  citation  for  the  1939  North  Dakota 
Supreme Court opinion, Larkin v. Gronna, is 285 N.W. 
59 (1939).

The  first  set  of  numbers  in  the  North  Western 
Reporter citations is the volume number. The second 
set  of  numbers  is  the  page  number  within  the 
volume where the case is located. The information 
in  between  the  parentheses  indicate  the  year  the 
North Dakota Supreme Court case was decided.

The  first  and  second  series  of  the  North  Western 
Reporter are available in print at the North Dakota 
Supreme Court Law Library.

Dakota Digest

The Dakota Digest, published by Thomson Reuters 
(West), is a handy way to find North Dakota Supreme 
Court  case  law  related  to  a  legal  term  or  concept. 
Snapshots of the opinions are listed, as well as the 
citation for the opinion.

Since  this  is  a West  publication,  the  Dakota  Digest 
uses  West’s  proprietary  Key  Number  System  for 
topic indexing.

Start  with  the  Descriptive  Word  Index  to  identify 
West’s Key Number, or Numbers, for the legal term 
or concept.

NORTH  DAKOTA  CASE  LAW  ONLINE  RESEARCH 
RESOURCES:

North  Dakota  case  law  legal  research  resources 
are  available  online  from  a  variety  of  different 
sources. Following are a selection of online research 
resources.

North Dakota Court System Website

Many,  but  not  all,  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court 
opinions  are  available  at  www.ndcourts.gov.  The 
website is free to use.

Free Legal Research Websites

Google  Scholar,  Justia,  and  the  Legal  Information 
Institute  are  free  legal  research  websites.  Legal 
research resources include case law.

Subscription Legal Research Websites

VersusLaw and Fastcase are legal research websites 
with  monthly  subscription  rates.  Legal  research 
resources  include  case  law  and  some  secondary 
sources of law, such as law reviews.

LexisNexis  and  Westlaw  provide  access  to  an 
extensive  list  of  legal research resources, including 
case law for state and federal courts. These websites 
tend  to  be  cost-effective  for  entities  with  many 
lawyers.  Locating  free  or  low-cost  access  to  these 
websites  is  a  challenge  for  individual  researchers. 
However,  the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law 
Library currently offers free patron access to Westlaw. 
Patrons may use Westlaw on the Law Library patron 
access  computer  located  at  the  State  Capitol  in 
Bismarck. Time limits apply based on the number of 
patrons requesting access.

Big  issues  like  homelessness,  addiction,  mental  illness,  and  poverty  are  at  the  height  of  our  current 
conversations, and can sometimes feel overwhelming. You might even start to feel burnt out or afraid to face 
your customers. This session is going to address ways that you can build your own personal capacity to deal 
with challenging situations at work, give you the tools to understand how trauma and mental illness might be 
impacting your patrons, and actionable ways you can avoid compassion fatigue.

Strategic Planning in a Deeply Weird World: The Flexible 
Roadmap Field Guide Approach (WebJunction) 
Tuesday, March 26, 2:00PM-3:00PM (CDT) 

Register: http://bit.ly/2TDNUBv 
 

It’s a big task to define the library’s future over the next three or five years, and strategic planning is becoming 
less and less effective in a rapidly changing world. The Salt Lake City Public Library (SLCPL) has created a new 
approach that is flexible, staff-driven, and human-centered. SCLPL’s Strategic Roadmap is not a 100-page plan 
in a binder-on-a-shelf; it’s an experiential learning tool that invites all staff to participate in the co-creation 
of  meaningful  outcomes  and  experiences  for  the  community. The  Roadmap  focuses  less  on  planning  and 
more on building capacity of staff to adopt a human-centered service design mindset and skillset. SLCPL staff 
are adopting a new perspective, continually experimenting with and adapting spaces, collections, services, 
programs, and their own roles, to responsively address community needs and aspirations in an ever-changing 
landscape. Join us for this webinar to learn how to cultivate new skills to help bring the Roadmap to life for 
your library’s strategic planning.

ALA MIDWINTER ANNUAL CONFERENCE RECAP
Submitted by Traci Lund, Director of the Divide County Public Library

   

 

MARCH 2019

Where  do  I  even  start?  So  much  to  say  and  so 
little  time!  I  just  got  back  from  ALA  Midwinter  
Conference  in  Seattle  and  WOW,  what  a  great 
conference. I have to admit, at first I wasn’t all that 
excited to attend. Coming from a small rural library 
(population  2,288  county  wide),  I  find  that  large 
national conferences don’t have a whole lot to offer 
me  except  jealousy  and  envy.  I  was  overwhelmed 
with the options of exhibits, vendors, and conference 
sessions. Everyone, whether you were large or small, 
urban or rural, had many great options! 

I would love to share everything I learned, but I would 
take over this whole newsletter. I do want to share 
two things from the conference that I thought were 
pretty awesome. The first, we have heard before, but 
it is always a good reminder. The second is a super 
fun programming idea that, even for us small guys, 
would be fun to implement!

1.  This happens to be my favorite saying from the 
whole  conference  –If  I’m  not  at  the  table  I’m 
always on the menu. As librarians we want to do 
it  all,  conquer  the  unattainable  mountain,  cure 
cancer, build an empire, and solve world hunger. 
Okay, maybe that was a little extreme, but we do 
try to be the best we can be for our communities. 
We  are  basically  the  coolest,  most  awesome 
people  around!!  However,  we  are  human  and, 
unfortunately,  cannot  do  it  all  (even  though 
we  will  continue  to  try). We  not  only  try  to  do 
everything for our libraries, but most are heavily 
involved  in  our  communities  as  well,  which 
makes  us  extra-extra  busy.  This  is  where  the 
saying  comes  into  play. What  I  took  away  from 
it  is  that  it’s  okay  to  not  be  able  to  do  it  all  on 
your own. It is okay to not be involved on every 
board  or  be  the  chairperson  for  every  event. 

It  is  okay  to  relinquish  some  of  the  power.  It  is 
okay to let go because those organizations and 
groups know what a ROCKSTAR you are and your 
library is. They know you will always help even if 
you  aren’t  at  the  forefront  of  everything. Those 
organizations know you are on the menu!! “I will 
take  a  cure  for  cancer  and  a  side  of  awesome-
sauce librarian to go!”

2.  We now live in a subscription-based world. You 
can get everything in a box these days — meals, 
makeup,  dog  supplies,  etc.  Hinsdale  Public 
Library  has  taken  this  concept  and  ran  with 
it. They  now  offer “Book  in  a  Box”.  As  in  all  the 
subscription  services,  the  first  thing  you  need 
to do is fill out a detailed questioner to help the 
librarian pick out a fun new title. 

Then  the  librarian  puts  together  your  box  that 
includes 1-2 books and a few “stuffers,” such as a 
mini bag of candy, a free vendor item you have 
laying around, a bookmark, etc. Due to the cost 
of shipping, they don’t ship the box to your door, 
but  they  do  have  it  all  ready  to  go  in  a  neatly 
packaged  box  for  you  to  pick  up  at  the  library. 
Currently, Hinsdale only offers this to teens, but 
how fun would it be to do adults or theme boxes; 
Mommy  and  Me,  My  Dad  is  Rad,  Date  Night, 
Book and a Movie, etc. I just loved this idea and 
thought it was just too good not to share.

3.  Yeah  a  bonus!  If  you  ever  have  a  chance  to  go 
to ALA, TOTALLY go! Just remember all the free 
books and other freebies you have to somehow 
pack and those dang airlines have limits on how 
heavy your bag can be. 

I feel very privileged that I was able to attend thanks 
to NDLA. It was an amazing opportunity!

led to an increase in the number of books being checked out and visitors at the library.

LEGO CLUB RECEIVES GRANT

Around mid-January, Turtle Lake-Mercer School Library’s LEGO Club received a $500 grant 
from Great River Energy. It has been used to purchase more LEGOs, allowing participants 
to  keep  building  on  their  creations  from  week-to-week  rather  than  taking  them  apart 
every time.

This photo is of two men cutting 
ice  on  the  Sheyenne  River  in 
1926.  The  man  on  the  right 
operates  a  saw,  cutting  the  ice, 
while the other man is grabbing 
the  chunks  of  ice  and  lifting 
them out of the river.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
