WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY GUARDIANSHIP? 

A Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee may appoint an emergency guardian for a child if 
the Judge or Judicial Referee determines there is probable cause to believe: 

•  Using the non-emergency guardianship appointment process is likely to result in 

substantial harm to the child’s health, safety, or welfare; AND 
•  An emergency appointment is in the best interest of the child; AND  
•  At least one of the following is true: 

o  Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order, but there’s been no appointment of a guardian for the 
child by will; or 

o  Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order and, under N.D.C.C. Chapter 30.1-27, a North Dakota 
state district court transferred the case to juvenile court without appointing a 
guardian for the child; or 

o  Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order and, under N.D.C.C. Chapter 30.1-27, the guardian 
nominated for the child in the deceased parent’s will failed to accept the 
appointment; or 

o  The parents have consented to the appointment of the emergency guardian for 

the child in writing by affidavit; or 

o  All parental rights have been previously terminated by court order; or 
o  The child is a child in need of protection as defined under N.D.C.C. Section 27-

20.1-01. 

A Juvenile Court hearing is required for ALL emergency guardianships.  The hearing on the 
appropriateness of the emergency guardianship must be held within 96 hours after the petition 
for emergency guardianship is filed. 

After the hearing, if the Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee decides that appointment of 
an emergency guardian is appropriate, the emergency guardianship LASTS NO MORE THAN 
60 DAYS from the date of the hearing.  However, the Judge or Judicial Referee may extend the 
emergency guardianship for up to 6 months.

Emergency Grdshp/Feb 2022 

YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS IF: 

1.  You are a person interested in the child’s welfare and want to be appointed the 

emergency guardian for the child; AND 

2.  The child’s circumstances make using the non-emergency guardianship appointment 

process likely to result in substantial harm to the child’s health, safety, or welfare; AND 

3.  At least one of the statements listed under “At least one of the following is true” on 

Page 2 is true. 

EX PARTE EMERGENCY GUARDIANSHIP FORMS PACKET: 

A court hearing is required for all emergency guardianships. However, in rare circumstances 
an emergency guardian may be appointed before holding the required hearing. This is called 
an ex-parte appointment of an emergency guardian. 

In addition to the requirements for appointing an emergency guardian, you must also show, in 
writing, that the child will be substantially harmed before a hearing can be held. 

An Ex Parte Emergency Guardianship Forms Packet is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/minor-guardianship/juvenile-court for petitioning a North Dakota Juvenile Court to 
appoint you the emergency guardian of a child without holding a hearing first. 

SOCIAL SERVICES IS NOTIFIED OF POTENTIAL ABUSE & NEGLECT 

When a petition for emergency guardianship is filed in Juvenile Court that alleges potential 
abuse or neglect of a child, a Juvenile Court officer files a report of suspected abuse and neglect 
with county social services.  North Dakota Juvenile Court staff are mandated reporters of 
potential abuse and neglect of a child. 

County social services reviews the report and decides whether to intervene.  Generally, if the 
child is in a safe environment, county social services won’t intervene in the case or take any 
action other than an administrative review.

LAWS & RULES 
(This is not a complete statement of laws and rules) 

Chapter 27-20.1 of the North Dakota Century Code legis.nd.gov/cencode/t27c20-1.pdf gives 
the requirements for a Juvenile Court to appoint an emergency guardian of a child. 

Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA): 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1963 
(uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title25/chapter21&edition=prelim) is a federal law that 
applies to children who are members or citizens of a Native American tribe or eligible for 
membership or citizenship in a Native American tribe and the biological child of a member or 
citizen of the tribe. 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Administrative Rules ndcourts.gov/legal-
resources/rules/ndsupctadminr/13 allows a Judicial Referee to hear and decide the petition for 
emergency guardianship, rather than a District Court Judge. 

The North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure apply to emergency guardianships in North 
Dakota Juvenile Courts.  The rules are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrjuvp. 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to matters in North Dakota Juvenile Courts.  The 
rules are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev.

Juvenile Court – North Dakota juvenile courts are a division of North Dakota state district 
courts.  Juvenile courts have jurisdiction over emergency guardianships of children who are 
under the age of 18.  Juvenile courts protect the best interests of children and address the 
unique characteristics and needs of children in guardianship matters. 

Known Father – A man who is listed on the child’s birth certificate as the father. 

Presumed Father – A man recognized as the father of a child until that status is rebutted or

1.  He and the mother of the child were married to each other and the child was born 

during the marriage; 

2.  He and the mother of the child were married to each other and the child was born 

within 300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment, declaration of 
invalidity, divorce, or decree of separation; 

3.  Before the birth of the child, he and the mother of the child married each other in 

apparent compliance with law, even if the attempted marriage is or could be declared 
invalid, and the child is born during the invalid marriage or within 300 days after its 
termination by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, divorce, or decree of 
separation; 

4.  After the birth of the child, he and the mother of the child married each other in

and openly held out the child as his own. 

Probable Cause – The burden of proof by which the Petitioner must convince the Judge or 
Judicial Referee that an emergency guardian should be appointed for the child. 

Black’s Law Dictionary (11th Edition, 2019) partially defines probable cause as “. . . more than a 
bare suspicion.”  “A reasonable belief in the existence of facts of which a claim is based . . ..”  

Relative – The definition is found in N.D.C.C. Section 27-20.1-01(7). 

Venue – The location (North Dakota county) where the Juvenile Court will hear and decide the 
emergency guardianship case.  The case may be filed in one of the following:

where the child has lived for the majority of the thirty days before the date of the 
alleged need of protection happened; OR 

4.  If the Petitioner alleges the child is in need of protection, the North Dakota county 

where the alleged need of protection happened. 

A JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY HEAR AND DECIDE THE EMERGENCY 
GUARDIANSHIP 

A Judicial Referee is a judicial officer appointed by the presiding District Court Judge. A Judicial 
Referee has the authority to preside in Juvenile Court cases.  The findings and order of the 
Judicial Referee have the effect of the findings and order of a District Court Judge until 
superseded by a written order of a District Court Judge. 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows emergency 
guardianship petitions in Juvenile Court to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather 
than a District Court Judge.  (A Judge is an elected judicial officer who has the authority to hear 
and decide North Dakota State District Court cases, including Juvenile Court cases.) 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the emergency guardianship petition, any party to the case 
may request that a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead. 

The party must file a written request with the Clerk of Court within seven (7) days after 
service of the notice of hearing. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 6 of 23 

Emergency Grdshp/Feb 2022 

If the emergency guardianship petition is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial 
Referee will issue findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order 
have the same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded 
by a written order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the emergency guardianship petition wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s 
findings of fact and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the 
specific reasons for the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven (7) days after service of 
notice of the right to review. 

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen (14) days after service of the notice of the request for review.

STEP SIX: Prepare Your Case. 

You, the Petitioner, must prove your allegations an emergency guardianship is necessary, and 
that there is probable cause to believe: 

•  Using the non-emergency guardianship appointment process is likely to result in 

substantial harm to the child’s health, safety, or welfare; AND 
•  An emergency appointment is in the best interest of the child; AND  
•  At least one of the following is true: 

o  Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order, but there’s been no appointment of a guardian for the 
child by will; or 

o  Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order and, under N.D.C.C. Chapter 30.1-27, a North Dakota 
state district court transferred the case to juvenile court without appointing a 
guardian for the child; or 

o  Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order and, under N.D.C.C. Chapter 30.1-27, the guardian 
nominated for the child in the deceased parent’s will failed to accept the 
appointment; or 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 19 of 23 

Emergency Grdshp/Feb 2022 

o  The parents have consented to the appointment of the emergency guardian for 

the child in writing by affidavit; or 

o  All parental rights have been previously terminated by court order; or 
o  The child is a child in need of protection as defined under N.D.C.C. Section 27-

20.1-01. 

Caution! Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. You’re held to same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

At minimum, you’ll need to review and research the laws and rules listed in the Laws and Rules 
section above. 

Subpoenas: Review Rule 13 of the North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure carefully!  If you 
require a witness to appear at a hearing or require production of documents, electronically 
stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of Court to issue a 
subpoena. Only a Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

Evidence: You’re required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your 
own evidence and when objecting to the evidence presented by other parties. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org)  If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the 
librarian or library staff of your local North Dakota library how to request the book. 

Following are a selection of library resources on ODIN that may be of interest to you:

Emergency Grdshp/Feb 2022 

STEP SEVEN: A Hearing is Held Before the Juvenile Court Makes a Decision. 

At least one hearing is required before the Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee makes a 
decision.  There may be more than one hearing, depending on the circumstances. 

If the Hearing will be Held in Person, Attend the Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a request form is available at 
ndcourts.gov/other-courts/juvenile-court. 

Be prepared to prove everything you typed or wrote in the documents you filed with the court. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. See Step 6 for 
more information. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

If your hearing is in person at the courthouse, arrive early so you don’t miss your hearing date 
and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to court on the date and time 
scheduled for trial, call the Juvenile Court as soon as you can. 

If the Hearing will by Held by Zoom, Make Sure You Can Connect to the Zoom Hearing: 

If your hearing is held electronically by Zoom, well before the hearing begins, make sure you 
can connect and understand how to function in Zoom. 

Don’t be late to the Zoom hearing. If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t attend 
the hearing on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the Juvenile Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The Judge, or Judicial Referee, hears both sides and then issues a final order.  Sometimes, the 
final order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final order is issued at a later date. 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the petitioner goes first. 

•  Petitioner Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The petitioner presents their case first. The other parties may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the petitioner’s evidence. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 21 of 23 

Emergency Grdshp/Feb 2022 

•  Other Parties Present Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The other parties present their case after the petitioner.  The petitioner may 

cross-examine witnesses and object to each other party’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

Before You Leave the Hearing:  

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the other parties go first. 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP EIGHT: Findings of Fact and Order and Letters of Emergency Guardianship. 

An emergency guardian isn’t appointed until the Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee issues 
Findings of Fact and Order. 

The Letters of Emergency Guardianship list the powers and duties ordered by the Juvenile Court 
Judge or Judicial Referee, and the Letters are proof of the appointed emergency guardian’s 
authority. 

THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY PREPARE THEIR OWN FINDINGS OF FACT 
AND ORDER AND LETTERS OF EMERGENCY GUARDIANSHIP. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee prepares their own Findings of Fact and Order and 
Letters of Emergency Guardianship, you will be mailed a signed copy.  Skip Step 8 and 
go to Step 9. 

HOWEVER, YOU, THE PETITIONER, MAY BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE PROPOSED 
FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER AND LETTERS OF GUARDIANSIP FOR THE JUDGE OR 
JUDICIAL REFEREE TO SIGN. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee requires you, the Petitioner, to prepare proposed 
Findings of Fact and Order and Letters of Guardianship, complete Step 8.

Letters of emergency guardianship is the document issued by the Juvenile Court that identifies 
the authority and limitations of the emergency guardian to make decisions on behalf of the 
child and identifies any other powers or authority given to the emergency guardian. 

The letters of emergency guardianship aren’t official until signed and dated by the Judge or 
Judicial Referee. 

The following proposed Letters of Emergency Guardianship form for this packet of forms is 
available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/minor-guardianship/juvenile-court: 

•  Letter of Emergency Guardianship

certified copy has a clerk’s stamp on it stating that the document is a duplicate of the original 
on file with the Juvenile Court.  The guardian may be required to provide a certified copy of the 
letters of guardianship when dealing with schools, government agencies, and other entities.) 

STEP NINE: After the Juvenile Court Appoints an Emergency Guardian. 

The emergency guardianship LASTS NO MORE THAN 60 DAYS from the date of the hearing.  
However, the Judge or Judicial Referee may extend the emergency guardianship for up to 6 
months.

guardian for the child, forms and instructions are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/minor-guardianship/juvenile-court.
