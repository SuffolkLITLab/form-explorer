      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO ANSWER A MOTION TO AMEND PARENTING TIME 
(VISITATION) IN A NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out any forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities 
as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if 
these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic 
procedure for answering a motion to a North Dakota state district court to amend the 
parenting time provisions in a North Dakota state district court judgment.  There is no 
guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self 
Help Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the 
forms or information provided.  Use at your own risk. 

(In 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “visitation” to 
“parenting time” and changed the term “custody” to “residential responsibility.”)

parenting time (visitation)! 

•  You have 14 days to answer if served by personal delivery or at your office. 
•  You have 17 days to answer if served by mail or third-party commercial carrier. 

(See Page 7 for more information about calculating these deadlines.) 

YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS ONLY IF: 

1.  You have a North Dakota state district court judgment that gave you or the other 

party parenting time (visitation); 

AND 

2.  The other party in the case made a written motion to the Court to change, or amend, 

the parenting time (visitation) provisions in the judgment. 

YOU CAN’T USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS TO ANSWER A MOTION TO 
CHANGE PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CUSTODY). 

If the other party in the case made a motion to change, which parent has primary residential 
responsibility (custody) in your North Dakota state district court judgment, you can’t use this 
packet of forms. 

Go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/custody for all of the forms and guides available 
through the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center for answering motions to modify primary 
residential responsibility (custody) in a North Dakota state district court judgment. 

IF YOUR PARENTING TIME (VISITATION) SITUATION DOESN’T MEET 
THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHO MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS: 

If your parenting time (visitation) situation doesn’t meet the requirements of who may use 
this packet of forms, neither the ND court system nor the ND Legal Self Help Center currently 
have other parenting time (visitation) packets of forms for you to use. 

However, general information about the court process of answering a motion is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/answering-a-motion.  The checklist and answer to motion 
templates are your starting point for creating your own answer to motion documents.

THE PARTIES 

Plaintiff: The parent who is listed as the Plaintiff in the original family law action that granted 
parenting time (visitation). 

Defendant: The parent who is listed as the Defendant in the original family law action that 
granted parenting time (visitation). 

Moving party: The parent who brought the motion to amend parenting time (visitation).  The 
moving party in the motion may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. 

Opposing party: The other parent.  In other words, the parent who didn’t bring the motion. 
(Also called the Non-moving party.) 

Real Party in Interest – (Also known as the Statutory Real Party in Interest.) The State of North 
Dakota is added as a real party in interest to family law actions only when:  

•  Child support will be established or modified, and a minor child receives assistance 

through programs administered by the North Dakota Department of Human Services, 
such as temporary assistance to needy families, Medicaid, and foster care;

•  Child support will be established or modified, and an application was made and 

 

accepted for services provided by the Child Support Division of the North Dakota 
Department of Human Services; or 

•  Child support or spousal support will be established or modified and North Dakota or 
the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services is 
required to be involved in proceedings related to support orders of other states or 
countries under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.

 

LAWS AND RULES 

 

Chapter 14-05 of the North Dakota Century Code governs divorce and legal separation.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c05.html

The North Dakota Rules of Court apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct.  See particularly:  

•  Rule 3.2 (Motions). 

The North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district 
courts.  The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp.  See 
particularly: 

•  Rule 5 (Service and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers). 
•  Rule 6 (Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers). 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev. 

North Dakota case law (court decisions) is useful for interpreting what the law means for your 
individual circumstances. 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota State District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

To research and view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov and click on 
“Supreme Court Opinions.” 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions).  Notes of case law (court decisions) 
related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are found in many North Dakota public 
and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

STEPS FOR OPPOSING PARTY TO ANSWER A MOTION TO AMEND 
PARENTING TIME (VISITATION) 

Remember: There’s no guarantee that using these forms and following the procedures outlined 
will result in the judge or judicial referee deciding motion the way to want.  There’s no 
guarantee that all judges, judicial referees and courts will accept forms available through the 
ND Legal Self Help Center.  If you feel you need assistance, consult a lawyer licensed to practice 
in North Dakota. 

Step One: 
Calculate your Deadline; Review the Forms and Instructions; Research Laws; 
Make Decisions; Gather Information. 

Calculate your deadline to answer the motion: 

You have 14 days to answer if you were served the motion to amend parenting time (visitation) 
by personal delivery or at your office. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion to amend was personally delivered or left at 

your office. 

You have 17 days to answer if you were served the motion to amend parenting time (visitation) 
by mail or third party commercial carrier. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion to amend was mailed. 
•  Keep the envelope with the postmarked date for reference. 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the 
period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday. 

Review the forms and instructions: 

Read these instructions carefully.  Review the individual forms.  Determine if the forms apply to 
your situation. If you don’t know if you should use this packet of forms, consult a lawyer who is 
licensed to practice in North Dakota.

Research statutes and case law: 

Use the Laws and Rules section on Pages 3 and 4 to research how the statutes (laws) enacted 
by the North Dakota Legislature and case law apply to your situation. 

Make decisions: 

Make an outline of the facts and arguments you want to include in your answer. 

Make a copy of the moving party’s motion to amend documents on which to make notes.  
Review ALL of the motion to amend documents and make an outline of the facts and 
arguments you want to include in your answer. 

You may find the “Answering a Motion – Checklist” useful as a general guide.  
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/answering-a-motion.   

Review the current judgment the moving party is asking the Court to amend.  Identify the 
paragraphs the moving party wants the court to amend.  Outline how the laws and your facts 
support your answer to the motion to modify. 

Decide if you’ll reference other supporting documentation in your answer to motion 
documents. 

Gather information: 

For example: 

•  At least one copy of the current judgment.  This is either the original judgment that 

granted parenting time (visitation), OR, if the original judgment has been amended, the 
most recently amended judgment. 

•  Supporting documentation you plan to refer to in your answer to motion documents. 

o  Any supporting documentation to which you refer in your answer to motion 

documents must be served on the moving party and filed with the Court.  (See 
Steps Three and Four below.) 

Verify the date of the current judgment and the Index Number that are referenced in the 
moving party’s motion documents: 

•  The date of current judgment is the date the judgment was signed. 
•  Get the Index Number of the current judgment at www.ndcourts.gov/public-access: 
o  Read the information and click the “Click Here to Proceed” button. 
o  Select “State of North Dakota” from the location drop down box. 
o  Click on the “Civil, Family & Probate Case Records” link.

o  Search by “Case” and enter your case number in the “Case Number” box. 
o  Click on the case number. 
o  Find the current judgment in the list of documents filed in the case. 
o  The Index Number is listed to the right of the name of the document.  

Step Two: 
Complete the (Optional) Notice of Hearing, Answer Brief to Motion, and 
Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief Forms in the Packet. 

Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink. 

(Optional) Form 8: Notice of Hearing on Motion to Amend Parenting Time: 

This form is optional.  Motions are designed to be decided on the documents alone. 
A hearing on the motion isn’t required. 

If the moving party didn’t indicate in their Notice of Motion that they scheduled a hearing on 
the motion, you have the option of requesting a hearing.  If you don’t schedule a hearing, the 
judge or judicial referee will make a decision on whether to amend parenting time (visitation) 
after reviewing the documents you and the moving party filed. 

You have a deadline – No later than 7 days after the deadline for filing your answer brief. 

If the moving party didn’t request a hearing and you want to request a hearing, you must make 
your request no later than 7 days after the deadline for filing your answer brief.  If you miss the 
deadline, you can’t request a hearing.

o  ONLY if you requested a hearing on the motion 
•  Form 9: Answer Brief to Motion to Amend Parenting Time; and 
•  Form 10: Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief to Motion to Amend Parenting Time. 

Keep one copy of each completed form listed above for your records.  You’ll file the originals 
with the clerk of district court in Step Five. 

Make TWO COPIES of all supporting documents you referred to in your answer to motion 
documents: 

For example, if you refer to affidavits that were completed by other individuals, or you refer to 
other types of supporting documentation, make two copies of each. 

Keep one copy of any supporting affidavits for your records.  You’ll file the originals of any 
supporting affidavits with the clerk of district court in Step Five. 

Keep the originals of any other supporting documentation (non-affidavits) for your records.  
You’ll file the copies of any other supporting documentation with the clerk of district court in

Step Five: 
File the Original, Completed Answer to Motion to Amend Parenting Time Forms 
and Other Supporting Documents with the Clerk of District Court. 

File the following Answer to Motion to Amend Parenting Time Forms and other supporting 
documents with the Clerk of District Court: 

The original, completed: 

• 

(Optional) Form 8: Notice of Hearing to Amend Parenting Time; 

o  ONLY if you requested a hearing on the motion 

•  Form 9: Answer Brief to Motion to Amend Parenting Time; 
•  Form 10: Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief to Motion to Amend Parenting Time; and 
•  Form 11: Affidavit of Service Form(s). 

And: 

•  Copies of all other supporting documents. 

Step Six (A): 
If the Motion will be Decided on ONLY the Documents Filed with the Court, the 
Judge or Judicial Referee Reviews the Documents Without Holding a Hearing. 

After the deadline passes for motion documents and answer to motion documents to be 
served and filed, if neither party requested a hearing, the judge or judicial referee assigned to 
your case will review the motion documents filed by you and the moving party. 

The motion to amend the parenting time (visitation) provisions in your current judgment will be 
decided only on the documents filed with the court.  No in-person hearing will be held. 

Step Six (B): 
If You or the Moving Party Requested a Hearing, Attend the Hearing. 

You must go to Court on the date set for the hearing. If you don’t go to Court, you’ll lose the 
case. Be sure to be on time. Bring to the hearing: 

•  Your copies of the completed forms you filed with the Clerk of Court’s Office; 
•  Any evidence you want the judge to know about (such as pictures, documents, receipts, 

bills, etc.); and

•  Any witnesses you want to talk to the judge and anyone having signed an affidavit. 

The judge or judicial referee won’t allow you to use as evidence (and won’t look at) any 
documents (such as letters, notes, or statements) written by someone other than yourself 
unless the person who wrote the document is in Court at the hearing. 

If you want the judge to hear what someone else has to say about your case, that person MUST 
be in Court – YOU can’t tell the judge what that person said or has to say.  You may force 
someone to attend the hearing by serving a subpoena on that person prior to the date of the 
hearing. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide and a Subpoena Informational Guide are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” Section. 

Step Seven: 
The Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Amend the Judgment. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee DOESN’T Grant the Motion to Amend Parenting Time: 

If the judge or judicial referee doesn’t grant the motion to amend parenting time, the current 
judgment remains in effect. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee GRANTS the Motion to Amend Parenting Time: 

If the judge grants the motion to amend parenting time in the current judgment, the judge or 
judicial referee will sign an order amending the parenting time provisions in the current 
judgment. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign the moving party’s proposed order, or 

may decide to sign a different proposed order. 

After the judge or judicial referee signs the order amending the parenting time provisions in the 
current judgment, the clerk of district court will sign an amended judgment that incorporates 
all of the amendments approved by the judge or judicial referee. 

Your current judgment ISN’T AMENDED until the clerk of district court signs the amended 
judgment and files it in your case. 

You’ll receive a copy of the signed amended judgment.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
