SECTION ONE: OVERVIEW OF EXPUNGEMENT OF INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT 
COURT RECORDS 

What is expungement of involuntary commitment court records? 

In general, expungement of involuntary commitment court records is deletion and destruction 
of all court record information. 

In North Dakota, an individual who was the respondent in a petition for involuntary 
commitment under North Dakota Century Code Chapter 25-03.1 may ask the North Dakota 
State District Court to expunge the court records as follows: 

25-03.1-45  Expungement of records.  

Following the discharge of a respondent from a treatment facility or the state 
hospital or the issuance of a court order denying a petition for commitment, a 
respondent may at any time move to have all court records pertaining to the 
proceedings expunged on condition that the respondent file a full release of all 
claims of whatever nature arising out of the proceedings.  

What records can be expunged? 

North Dakota Century Code Section 25-03.1-45 specifically states “all court records 
pertaining to the proceedings” may be expunged. 

The North Dakota court system maintains records of documents and evidence that were 
filed with the court during the involuntary commitment case.  The North Dakota court 
system also maintains records generated during hearings or trials that occurred during 
the involuntary commitment case. 

When can a Respondent ask the North Dakota State District Court to expunge their 
involuntary commitment court records? 

The Respondent is the individual who the North Dakota State District Court was asked to 
involuntarily commit to a treatment facility or the state hospital. 

A Respondent in a North Dakota Century Code Chapter 25-03.1 involuntary 
commitment case may file a motion to expunge the court records if: 

1.  The Respondent has been discharged from a treatment facility or the state 

2.  The District Court Judge issued a court order denying the petition for 

hospital; OR 

commitment.

Expunge Commitment Records/Oct 2021 

Are there any other conditions a Respondent must meet to expunge their involuntary 
commitment court records? 

Yes, when the Respondent makes a request to expunge their involuntary commitment 
court records, they must also file a full release of all claims of whatever nature arising 
out of the involuntary commitment case proceedings. 

How does a Respondent make the request to expunge their involuntary commitment 
court records? 

The request is made with a written motion in the existing involuntary commitment case 
the Respondent wishes to expunge. 

See Page 6 for the basic process of making a motion. 

No forms or instructions are available through the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center 
or the North Dakota Court System for making a motion to expunge involuntary 
commitment court records. 

If you represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own motion documents.  You may 
also retain an attorney to create the motion documents for you. 

Can examples of expungement motion documents from other involuntary 
commitment cases be provided upon request? 

No.  All North Dakota Century Code Chapter 25-03.1 cases are confidential.  Information about 
the existence of these cases and the court records filed in these cases AREN’T available to the 
public. 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center can’t provide examples of documents filed in 
confidential cases. 

Where is a motion to expunge involuntary commitment court records filed? 

The written motion and the written full release of all claims are filed in the involuntary 
commitment case containing the court records the Respondent wants expunged. 

If the Respondent has a copy of the involuntary commitment order, or the order denying 
involuntary commitment, the case number and county are listed on the first page. 

Contact information for Clerks of District Court by North Dakota county is available at 
ndcourts.gov/court-locations.

Century Code contains the laws enacted by North Dakota Legislature.  The NDCC is available at 
legis.nd.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code.  **These aren’t the full chapters 
and sections contained in the NDCC, please follow the links to view the laws in full.**)

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW  

(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

Review the North Dakota Supreme Court opinions related to expungement.  One way to 
research case law, is to use the print version of the North Dakota Century Code to find the short 
summaries of case law after each Section of the Century Code. 

The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the Century Code Section.  To 
view the full text of the opinion, go to ndcourts.gov and click on “Supreme Court Opinions.”  
Enter the case name or case citation. 

Another way to research case law is to search by topic at ndcourts.gov and click on “Supreme 
Court Opinions.”  Use the “Topic” drop down list to narrow your search by topic.

SECTION THREE: BASIC COURT PROCESS FOR EXPUNGING INVOLUNTARY 
COMMITMENT COURT RECORDS 

When asking the court for an order to expunge involuntary commitment court records, it’s

they apply to the facts of the particular situation.  Facts referred to in the brief 
must also appear in the affidavit.

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center DOESN’T have forms or instructions available for

help/general-use-forms.  You may find the General-Use template forms useful as a starting 
point for creating your own legal documents.

Limited Legal Representation

actions. 

Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an attorney can 
help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of the 
case the attorney handled. 

For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
