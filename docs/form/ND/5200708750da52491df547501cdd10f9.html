      <pre>Instructions for Guardian and Conservator 
Final Report and Accounting Form 

Court employees may not help you fill out this form. 
Do not include these instructions when you mail or file the completed form. 

Purpose 

The Final Report and Accounting gives the Court a summary of the protected person’s (ward or 
conservatee) assets and liabilities. There are several instances when a Final Report might be 
needed:  

a.  if the court determines the protected person no longer requires assistance with 

managing their financials. 

b.  if the court orders a successor guardian or conservator and financial authority is 

transferred to another person or entity. 

c.  when the protected person passes away. 

If financial authority is transferred to another, this report will assist in planning and preserving 
the assets for the protected person’s future benefit. If the protected person has passed away, 
this report will be useful for the estate disposition. 

Fillable forms are available on the North Dakota State Court’s website: www.ndcourts.gov by 
clicking on the Legal Self Help & Forms link. Attach additional pages as necessary to provide a 
complete report with any appropriate explanations. 

Confidentiality of the Protected Person 

Rule 3.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court requires that reports not contain the following 
identification information: 

•  Social security numbers; 
•  Taxpayer identification numbers; 
•  Birthdates; 
•  Financial account numbers; or 
•  The name of an individual known to be a minor.

The following examples are acceptable substitutions: 

•  The last four digits of a social security or financial account number; 
•  The year of an individual’s birth; and 
•  A minor’s initials.  

Completing the Final Report and Accounting: 

Don’t leave any of the form blank.  If a section of the form doesn’t apply to you or the 
protected person, type or write “0.00” for the dollar amount, or “N/A” for not applicable. 

•  Top of Form 

If the court has not completed the top of the form for you: 

a.  Enter the county and district court names.  

b.  Fill in legal name of the protected person (see above for minors). 

c.  Enter the case number from your Letters of Guardianship or Conservatorship. 

•  Protected Person and Guardian/Conservator Information 

a.  Complete the current address, age, and phone number of the protected person.  

b.  Fill in the information for guardian or conservator. Complete the contact 
information including address, phone numbers, and emails for each. 

c. 

If there is a co-guardian or co-conservator, fill in the information for the co-guardian 
or co-conservator. Complete the contact information including address, phone 
numbers, and emails for each.  If there isn’t a co-guardian or co-conservator, type or 
write “N/A.” 

•  Final Accounting 

This section is included to provide information about the income and expenses of the estate 
since the last annual report was submitted to the court. The beginning date should be the 
day after your last accounting report. 

If no reports have been submitted, the start date should be the date of your appointment as 
guardian or conservator. The end date will be the last date that you managed any of the 
protected person’s property, or turned information over to a successor, heirs, etc. If you still 
have control over some assets, use today’s date.

Include all of the deposits the protected person has received in their spending accounts 
since the last annual report, and all of the payments made. If the person’s ending checking 
account balance is zero because of a transfer of funds, please include that information in 
the comments (#23).  

The following explanations are provided for specific questions listed on the form:  

• #1 beginning balance: if this is the first report for the protected person, the beginning 
balance will be the total of the “Cash, checking accounts” section of the Beginning 
Inventory report. These are the accounts that you or other authorized people use to 
pay expenses. If this is not the first report for the ward, the beginning account balance 
will be the ending balance from the last annual report. Also enter the beginning 
balance on line #6. 

• #2 income and deposits will include all income as well as transfers into the checking 
account(s) from other accounts such as savings or trusts. Total all of the income and 
deposits on line #3 at the bottom of this section, and also enter the total on line #7. 

• #4 the expenses and withdrawals section is where you will list all of the payments made 

and any transfers out to other accounts. The “Personal needs” category includes 
clothing, hygiene and beauty products, first aid, personal shopping and similar products 
and services. Any large or unusual expenses should be described in the comments 
(#23). Total all of the expenditures on line #5 at the bottom of this section, and also 
enter the total on line #8. 

• #9: the ending balance is the sum of the beginning balance plus the total of all deposits, 
and the subtraction of all the expenditures. This balance should match the ward’s total 
checking and spending account balances on the date of this accounting report.  

• #10: this section is for any assets that you have sold or otherwise disposed of since your 
last financial report to the court. This section should include any assets you may have 
already transferred to another party. Attach additional pages if necessary.  

•  Ending Inventory (*see examples below) 

If all assets have not yet been transferred, the Ending Inventory section will need to be 
completed to report all of the protected person’s assets and remaining debt. Attach 
additional sheets if more space is required. New assets acquired should be explained in the 
comments (#23).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
