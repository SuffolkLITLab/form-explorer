An Informational Guide to a North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves 
in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this informational

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer.

SECTION ONE: 

INFORMATION ABOUT OBJECTIONS TO THE NAME CHANGE OF A 
MINOR CHILD IN NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT 

The parent or guardian of a minor child may petition (request) a North Dakota state district 
court to legally change their minor child’s name. 

A North Dakota state district court may legally change a minor child’s name if: 

•  The minor child is a resident of the North Dakota county for at least the past 6 months 

before the parent or guardian files the request; 

•  The minor child is either a United States citizen, or a United States permanent resident 

alien; and 

•  The request is in the best interest of the minor child, is made in good faith, isn’t made to 
defraud or mislead, won’t cause injury to an individual, and won’t compromise public 
safety. 

Objections to the requested name change must be made within 30 days of the date of 
publication of the Notice of Petition for Name Change. 

OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS FOR OBJECTION TO 
NAME CHANGE OF A MINOR CHILD 

Step One:   

The objecting party must serve an Objection to Petition for Name Change of a 
Minor Child on the Petitioner, or their attorney, within 30 days of the date of 
publication of the Notice of Petition for Name Change.  (The Notice is published 
in the newspaper in the North Dakota county where the Petitioner and minor 
child reside.  If the child has a non-custodial parent, the Notice is also published in 
the newspaper where the non-custodial parent resides.) 

Step Two: 

The person who mailed the Objection to Petition for Name Change of a Minor 
Child completes an Affidavit of Service by Mail. 

Step Three: 

The objecting party files the Objection to Petition for Name Change of a Minor 
Child and Affidavit of Service by Mail.  (The objecting party cannot file the 
Objection and Affidavit of Service until the Petitioner has filed the petition.) 

Step Four:   

If a hearing is scheduled and you receive notice, you MUST attend the hearing 
if you would like your objection considered.

LAWS AND RULES 

Requirements for name changes are found in North Dakota Century Code Chapter 32-28.   

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, administrative 
rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota law can be found 
in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give you legal 
advice, which includes interpreting how the laws apply to your situation. 

DEFINITIONS 

Clerk of Court:  A court official who keeps track of court files, records and exhibits.  All 
documents that are required to be filed with a North Dakota state court, are filed with the 
office of the clerk of court. 

Minor Child:    An individual who is under eighteen years of age. 

Noncustodial Parent:  A parent with less than 50% of the residential responsibility. 

Notice of Petition of Name Change:  The notice published in an official county newspaper 
giving notice of the Petitioner’s intent to change their minor child’s name.  This notice must be 
published 30 days before the petition can be filed with the court.  The notice is published in the 
North Dakota county where the Petitioner and minor child reside.  If the minor child has a non-
custodial parent, the notice is also published in the county where the non-custodial parent 
resides, if different. 

Objecting Party:  The person who objects to the name change of a minor child and serves and 
files an objection regarding the name change. 

Petitioner:  The minor child’s parent or guardian who resides with the child.  The Petitioner 
starts the request to legally change their minor child’s name by publishing a notice of name 
change in the newspaper and files their Petition for Name Change with the clerk of court. 

Waiver of Publication:  The petitioner may ask the North Dakota state district court to allow 
them to skip (waive) the requirement to publish notice of their name change when: 

•  The Petitioner only wants to change their minor child’s first or middle name; or  
•  The Petitioner and/or minor child is the victim of domestic violence.

STEP ONE:   THE OBJECTING PARTY SERVES AN OBJECTION ON THE PETITIONER 
WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE NOTICE OF PETITION 
FOR NAME CHANGE.  

IMPORTANT!   The written Objection to Petition for Name Change MUST be served on the 

Petitioner, or the Petitioner’s lawyer, within 30 days of the date of publication of the Notice 
of Petition for Name Change. 

Petitions for name changes don’t require an in-person hearing.  The District Court may grant 
the name change of a minor child based only on the documents filed with the clerk of court. 

If you miss the deadline for serving your objection on the Petitioner, or the Petitioner’s lawyer, 
the District Court may not consider your objection when deciding whether to grant the 
petitioner’s request to legally change their minor child’s name. 

FIRST: You, the objecting party, calculate your deadline for serving your written 
Objection to Petition for Name Change. 

 

You have 30 days from the date of publication of the Notice of Petition for Name Change to 
serve your objection on the Petitioner. 

The Notice of Petition for Name Change is published in the official newspaper of the North 
Dakota county where the Petitioner and the minor child resides.  If the county doesn’t have an 
official newspaper, the Notice is published in a newspaper that has general circulation in the 
county. 

If the minor child has a non-custodial parent, the Notice of Petition for Name Change is also 
published in the official newspaper of the county where the non-custodial parent resides.  If the 
county doesn’t have an official newspaper, the Notice is published in a newspaper that has 
general circulation in the county. 

When calculating your 30-day deadline for service:  

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the 30-day period;  

•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and  

• 

Include the last day of the 30-day period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or 
legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

Object Name Change Minor/May 2020 

FOURTH: You, the objecting party, arrange to serve a copy of all pages of your 
completed Objection to Petition for Name Change on the Petitioner. 

 

A copy of all pages of your completed Objection must be mailed to the Petitioner from a United 
States Post Office.  The completed Objection must be mailed First Class, postage prepaid. 

IMPORTANT!   If the petitioner is represented by a lawyer, mail a copy of your completed 

Objection to the lawyer instead of the petitioner. 

• 

If the Notice of Petition for Name Change lists a lawyer, the petitioner is represented. 

STEP TWO: THE PERSON WHO MAILED THE OBJECTION TO PETITION FOR NAME 
CHANGE COMPLETES THE AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE BY MAIL.  

The person who took the copy of the Objection to Petition for Name Change to the Post Office 
and mailed it to the Petitioner, or the Petitioner’s lawyer, completes an Affidavit of Service by 
Mail. 

You may use the formatting example of an Affidavit of Service by Mail in Section Three of this 
guide (Pages 11-14). 

•  The formatting example ISN’T fillable online, but you may print and handwrite in dark 

ink.  Make sure your handwriting is readable. 

Complete the Affidavit of Service by Mail: 

  The Caption, or top, of the Affidavit of Service by Mail must include the same 

information as the Caption of the Notice of Petition for Name Change published in the 
newspaper.

  Paragraph 2.  If this statement isn’t true, you can’t serve documents by mail. 

  Paragraph 3.  Put a checkmark () in the checkbox next to “Objection to Petition for

signed the Affidavit of Service by Mail. 

  Fill in the date when the person who mailed the documents signed the Affidavit of

Make a copy of the completed, dated and signed Affidavit of Service by Mail for your records. 

STEP THREE: FILE THE ORIGINAL OBJECTION TO PETITION FOR NAME CHANGE 
AND AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE BY MAIL WITH THE CLERK OF COURT.  

IMPORTANT!   Since the Petition for Name Change can’t be filed with the court until at least 30 

days after notice of the petition is published in the newspaper, the Petition for Name Change 
may not yet be filed with the clerk of court. 

You can’t file your Objection to Petition for Name Change documents with the clerk of court 
until after the Petition for Name Change is filed by the Petitioner.  The clerk of court may ask 
you to check the website frequently to determine if the petition has been filed.  

Name Change of Minor cases are publically available state court records.  You may search 
publically available North Dakota state court records by the first and last name of the 
Petitioner or the minor child. 

You can find individual court cases and lists of the documents filed in each case by going to

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
