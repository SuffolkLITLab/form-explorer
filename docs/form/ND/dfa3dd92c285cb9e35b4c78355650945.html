INFORMATION ABOUT LEGAL SEPARATION IN NORTH DAKOTA 

WHAT IS A LEGAL SEPARATION? 

Legal separation is a civil court process with requirements that are very similar to the 
requirements for granting a divorce. 

Unlike a divorce, a legal separation doesn’t end the marriage.  Legally separated spouses can’t 
remarry.  However, a legal separation ends many of the legal responsibilities spouses have to 
each other, while they’re married. 

The court’s order may include: 

•  Property and debt division between the spouses; 
•  Spousal support (alimony); 
•  Residential responsibility (custody) and parenting time (visitation) established between 

the spouses; and 

•  Child support. 

A Legal Separation may be Granted for the Same Reasons (Grounds) a Divorce may be 
Granted: 

The most common reason (ground) given for legal separation and divorce is irreconcilable 
differences.  Irreconcilable differences are also referred to as “no fault.” 

Irreconcilable differences don’t require either spouse to prove which spouse is at fault, and the 
court isn’t required to decide which of the parties is at fault for the legal separation. 

Effect of a Legal Separation: 

When a North Dakota State District Court grants a legal separation, the decree of separation 
gives the spouses all the rights of property, business, and contracts as if unmarried and releases 
both spouses from all obligations of maintenance, except as may be required by the decree of 
legal separation. 

If You Want a Divorce After a Legal Separation is Granted: 

If you decide you want a divorce after a North Dakota State District Court grants a legal 
separation, you’ll need to prepare, serve, and file paperwork to ask the court to revoke the 
legal separation and grant a divorce.

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE LEGAL SEPARATION FORMS? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have a packet of forms for legal separation. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own legal separation documents.  
The names and descriptions of the documents you’ll need to create are found throughout this 
guide. 

Examples of some of the legal separation documents are found in the Appendix at the end of 
this guide. 

You may find the General-Use template forms of interest as a starting point for creating your 
own divorce documents. 

The General-Use template forms are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking 
on the "General Use Checklists and Forms" link under “District Court Civil”.   

•  The direct link to the General-Use template forms is www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-

help/general-use-forms. 

You may find the forms in the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual of interest.  
The Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual contains a variety of divorce forms that 
were created for lawyers to use as examples in family law cases.  The Legal Services of North 
Dakota website is www.legalassist.org. 

(References to the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual are for your convenience 
only.  The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t endorse, warrant, or accept responsibility for the 
content or uses of the Family Law Manual. You must independently determine the legal 
sufficiency of the forms in the Family Law Manual.  Use at your own risk.)  

IS THERE HELP AVAILABLE FOR CREATING  LEGAL SEPARATION DOCUMENTS? 

If you would like assistance creating your documents, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota. 

Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to practice in North 
Dakota may agree to help you with part of your legal separation action, such as preparing legal 
documents, while you handle the rest of the legal separation action.  You and the lawyer must 
agree in writing to any Limited Legal Representation agreement.

WHAT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TERMS IN A 
LEGAL SEPARATION  ACTION? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they’re not intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Assets – everything owned by either spouse, whether owned jointly or individually. Assets 
include, but aren’t limited to, real property, cars, furniture, bank accounts, jewelry, life 
insurance policies, businesses, and retirement plans. 

Decision making responsibility – the responsibility to make decisions concerning a child.  The 
term may refer to decisions on all issues or on specific issues, but not child support issues. 

Debts – (Also called “Liabilities.”) everything owed by either spouse, whether owed jointly or 
individually. Debts include, but are not limited to, mortgages, credit cards, student loans and 
car loans. 

Deploying or deployed parent – a deploying or deployed parent is a uniformed service member 
who has been notified of orders of movement or mobilization for more than ninety days but 
less than eighteen months AND the orders are designated as unaccompanied, not authorized 
for dependent travel, or don’t permit family members to move to the deployment location. 

Equitable distribution – (Also called “Equitable Division.”) marital property is distributed 
equitably (fairly) in a legal separation.  A court would make an equitable distribution based on 
the following factors: 

•  Respective ages of the spouses; 
•  Earning ability; 
•  Duration of the marriage and conduct of the spouses during the marriage; 
•  Station in life; 
•  Circumstances and necessities of the spouses; 
•  Health and physical condition; 
•  Financial circumstances as shown by the property owned at the time; 
•  Value of the property owned at the time; 
• 
Income-producing capacity of the property owned at the time, if any; 
•  Whether the property was accumulated before or after the marriage; and 
•  Any other matters that may be material. 

Generally, the factors above are applied when spouses don’t agree.  However, a court has the 
authority to decide whether a settlement agreement between the spouses was entered into as 
a result of mistake, duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence.

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

Home state – the state in which a child lived with a parent for at least six consecutive months 
immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding. In the case of a child 
less than six months of age, home state means the state in which the child lived from birth with 
a parent.  A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period. 

Irreconcilable differences – (Also called “No Fault.”) substantial reasons for not continuing the 
marriage and which make it appear the marriage should be dissolved.  The court need only find 
that irreconcilable differences exist.  

Legal separation – a legal separation ends many of the legal responsibilities spouses have to 
each other, while they’re married.  A legal separation doesn’t end the marriage. 

Marital property – all of the assets and debts owned by either spouse, whether owned jointly 
or individually. 

No fault – (See “Irreconcilable Differences” definition above.) 

Obligor – the person ordered by the court to pay child support or spousal support. 

Obligee – the person receiving child support or spousal support ordered by the court. 

Parental rights and responsibilities – all the rights and responsibilities a parent has concerning 
the parent's child. 

Parenting plan – a written plan describing each parent's rights and responsibilities. 

Parenting schedule – the schedule of when the child is in the care of each parent. 

Parenting time – the time when the child is to be in the care of a parent.  (Also known as 
“Visitation.”) 

Personal property – every kind of property that isn’t real property.  (See “Real Property” 
definition below.)  Personal property includes, but isn’t limited to, cars, furniture, bank 
accounts, jewelry, life insurance policies, businesses, and retirement plans. 

Primary residential responsibility – a parent with more than fifty percent of the residential 
responsibility. 

Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) – an order of the court that directs the 
administrator of a retirement plan to divide retirement assets as granted in a legal separation 
judgment.  There are many different QDRO’s that are specific to the type of retirement plan.  
For more information about QDRO’s, go to www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/workers-and-
families/separation-and-divorce. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

***If you divide a retirement asset between spouses, a QDRO is required.  The spouses MUST 
present a proposed QDRO to the court to consider and sign. 

The court WON’T draft a QDRO for you.  The ND Legal Self Help Center DOESN’T have QDRO 
forms or instructions.  Consulting a lawyer is strongly recommended when dividing a retirement 
asset!*** 

Real property – land either with or without buildings upon it.  (See “Personal Property” 
definition above.) For example, a home is real property.  

Residency requirement – the amount of time a spouse must live in North Dakota before they 
can ask a North Dakota district court to grant a legal separation.  The residency requirement for 
North Dakota is 6 months. 

Residential responsibility – a parent's responsibility to provide a home for the child.  (Also 
known as “Custody.”) 

WHO ARE THE PARTIES IN A LEGAL SEPARATION? 

Plaintiff (or Petitioner) – The spouse who starts the legal separation action by serving a 
summons and complaint on the other spouse. 

Defendant (or Respondent) – The spouse who is served the summons and complaint for legal 
separation by the other spouse. 

Real Party in Interest (also known as the Statutory Real Party in Interest) – The State of North 
Dakota is added as a real party in interest to parenting rights and responsibilities actions only 
when: 

•  Child support will be established or modified and a minor child receives assistance 

through programs administered by the North Dakota Department of Human Services, 
such as temporary assistance to needy families, Medicaid, and foster care; or 

•  Child support will be established or modified and an application was made and accepted 
for services provided by the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of 
Human Services; or 

•  Child support or spousal support will be established or modified and North Dakota or 
the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services is 
required to be involved in proceedings related to support orders of other states or 
countries under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.

WHAT IS THE NORTH DAKOTA RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT  FOR LEGAL 
SEPARATION? 

The Plaintiff must be a North Dakota resident for six consecutive months before the legal 
separation action begins, or six consecutive months at the time the decree of legal separation is 
entered by the court. 

WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO LEGAL SEPARATION? 

Chapter 14-05 of the North Dakota Century Code governs divorce and legal separation.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c05.html

child support and spousal support orders issued by other states or countries.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c12-2.html 

Chapter 14-14.1 of the North Dakota Century Code governs which state can make decisions 
about child custody issues and enforce child custody orders.  If minor children are part of your 
legal separation action, you’ll need to determine if a North Dakota state district court can make 
decisions about child custody.  www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c14-1.html 

Chapter 14-05, 14-09 and 14-14.1 are Chapters within Title 14 of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  There are many other laws related to families in Title 14.  You may find them of interest.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14.html 

The North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district

North Dakota case law is useful for interpreting what the law means for your individual 
circumstances. 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

One way to research case law related to divorce, is to use the print version of the North Dakota 
Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each Section of the Century Code.  
The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the Century Code Section. 

To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court 
Opinions” link and enter the case name or case citation. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions).  Notes of case law (court decisions) 
related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are found in many North Dakota public 
and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

WHAT ARE LEGAL REASONS (GROUNDS) FOR LEGAL SEPARATION? 

•  Adultery 
•  Extreme cruelty 
•  Willful desertion 
•  Willful neglect 
•  Abuse of alcohol or controlled substance 
•  Conviction of a felony 
• 

Irreconcilable differences (no fault) 

Irreconcilable differences is also called a no fault legal separation.  Neither spouse is required to 
prove the other spouse is at fault for the legal separation and the court doesn’t decide which 
spouse is at fault.  Irreconcilable differences only require that the court decide there are 
substantial reasons for not continuing the marriage, which make it appear the spouses should 
legally separate. 

WHAT ARE COMMON LEGAL SEPARATION  ISSUES RELATED TO SPOUSES? 

•  Spousal support, including alimony 
•  Dividing property between spouses 
•  Dividing debts between spouses 
•  Name change back to the pre-marriage last name 

Property and debt are divided equitably (fairly), not equally, in a legal separation.  The court 
may redistribute property and debts after the legal separation is granted if a spouse failed to 
disclose property and debts, or if a spouse fails to follow the terms of the court order. 

The court will consider the following when deciding whether to award spousal support and 
when deciding how to equitably divide property and debt:  

•  Age of each spouse, 
•  Earning ability,  
•  Length of the marriage,  
•  Conduct of each spouse during the marriage, 
•  Station in life, 
•  Circumstances and necessities of each spouse, 
•  Health and physical condition of each spouse,

A note about dividing pension or retirement plans: 

Dividing pension plans and retirement accounts is extremely complicated. The spouses are 
responsible for making sure these assets are divided, which will require a separate court order 
to divide these assets.  The separate court order is called a Qualified Domestic Relations Order 
(QDRO) and the parties are responsible for obtaining a proposed QDRO and presenting the 
proposed QDRO to the court.  The court won’t draft a QDRO document or an order including a 
QDRO. 

***The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have QDRO forms or instructions and can’t assist 
with drafting or obtaining QDRO’s.  Consulting a lawyer is strongly recommended when dividing 
a retirement asset!*** 

(If neither spouse has pension nor retirement plans, OR the spouses will keep their own 
pension or retirement plans, a QDRO isn’t necessary.) 

WHAT ARE COMMON LEGAL SEPARATION  ISSUES RELATED TO CHILDREN?  

•  Residential responsibility of children, also known as custody 
•  Parenting time, also known as visitation 
•  Decision making responsibilities 
•  Child support 
•  Medical coverage, including health insurance premiums, copays, deductibles, etc. 

When spouses can’t agree on custody and visitation, the court will decide based on the best 
interests of the children.  The 13 best interest factors are found in Section 14-09-06.2 of the 
North Dakota Century Code. 

Child Support: 

Child support is based on guidelines set by the North Dakota Department of Human Services.  If 
a parent can show a different ability to earn income than the guidelines show, the court may 
order a higher or lower child support payment. 

The Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services created and 
provides support for the Child Support Guidelines Calculator. The Calculator can be found at 
childsupport.dhs.nd.gov/lawyers/child-support-guidelines.  

The Child Support Division may be able to provide some assistance with your child support 
calculations. (701-328-5440; 800-231-4255).  Court personnel and staff of the ND Legal Self 
Help Center can’t assist with child support calculations.

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION   

You’re not required to hire a lawyer to bring an action for legal separation in a North Dakota 
State District Court.  If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws 
and procedures that a lawyer is required to follow. 

Lawyer Resources 

If you decide to find a lawyer to represent you, you may find the following options of interest.  

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income. Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income. The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is 
www.legalassist.org. 

•  The State Bar Association provides a lawyer referral service to match paying clients in 
need of legal services with lawyers. The phone number is (866) 450-9579 and the

search by name or location. 

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions. Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that a lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case. You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled. For example: 

•  You may want a lawyer to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your legal 

•  You can consult with a lawyer to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend 

rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with a 

lawyer who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire a lawyer just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

A note about confidential information in legal separation documents: 

Court records are generally available to the public, and anyone can request to look in almost 
any court file. However, certain information is required to remain confidential, even if it’s part 
of a public court record. 

Each spouse is solely responsible for making sure confidential information doesn’t appear in the 
documents they each prepare in a legal separation action. Confidential information includes: 

•  Full names of minor children 
•  Full birthdates 
•  Social security numbers 
•  Taxpayer identification numbers 
•  Financial-account numbers 

Documents filed in a legal separation action with references to confidential information must 
include only: 

•  The minor child’s initials  
•  The year of birth 
•  The last four (4) digits of the social security number and taxpayer identification number 
•  The last four (4) digits of the financial-account number 

Each spouse must prepare and file a separate confidential information form that contains the 
full confidential information that isn’t allowed in the legal separation documents. 

The confidential information form becomes a part of the court records that isn’t seen by the 
public. 

The Plaintiff Creates the Following Documents:  

•  Summons 

o  Review Rule 8.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court.  A summons notifies the 
Defendant that the Plaintiff started the legal separation process and the 
Defendant must file a written answer in order to participate in the case.  See the 
fillable “Summons form – Divorce or Separation Actions” under the General Use 
Checklists and Forms link. 

o  An example of a legal separation summons is also found at the end of this 

Informational Guide.

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

•  Complaint 

o  A complaint gives the court information about the Plaintiff and Defendant, their 
minor or dependent children, and property.  Tells the court what the Plaintiff is 
asking for from the court. 

o  At minimum, the legal separation complaint must include brief statements that 

describe the following: 

  How the Plaintiff meets the residency requirements for legal separation.

• 

If the information is included in a separate affidavit (see next 
bullet), refer to the affidavit. 
If the required information from § 14-14.1-20 of the North Dakota 
Century Code is included in the complaint, the complaint must be 
verified.  (See the “Verification form at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-
self-help/general-use-forms.) 

  Statements related to child support and/or spousal support. 
  Statements related to division of property and debt. 
  Whether the Plaintiff wishes to restore his or her prior name. 
  Requests for relief, also called demands for relief. 

•  Tells the court what the Plaintiff wants the court to do.

after the first publication of the summons in the newspaper. 

If the Defendant Doesn’t Answer the Summons and Complaint: 

If the Defendant doesn’t serve a written answer to the summons and complaint on the Plaintiff 
within the required timeline, the Plaintiff may request a default legal separation judgment. 

The Plaintiff may request a default legal separation judgment if the Plaintiff can prove to the 
court that the Defendant was served the summons and complaint correctly and didn’t answer.  
The request is made in a written motion to the court. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions for making a motion for a 
default legal separation judgment.

THE DEFENDANT HAS LIMITED TIME TO ANSWER. DON’T DELAY!  

The Defendant has twenty-one (21) days, not including the date of service, to serve a written 
answer on the Plaintiff.  If the Plaintiff is represented by a lawyer, serve the written answer on 
the lawyer.  If the Defendant doesn’t respond within twenty-one (21) days, not including the

IMPORTANT! 

Following are the remaining basic parts of a Legal Separation  action. 

HOWEVER, individual District Courts  may have a different process for Parts 
Three, Four & Five than is provided in this Legal Separation Informational  Guide. 

In divorce cases, spouses must follow the requirements of Rule 8.3 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court.  Since legal separations have requirements that are very similar to the 
requirements for granting a divorce, individual courts may require spouses in legal 
separation cases to follow Rule 8.3.  To ask if the court follows Rule 8.3 for legal 
separation cases, contact the Clerk of Court’s office in the County where you’ll file. 

This Informational  Guide DOESN’T include the Rule 8.3 requirements. 

If the individual District Court requires legal separation actions to follow the 
requirements of Rule 8.3 of the North Dakota Rules of Court, you can find the 
requirements in Rule 8.3 (link above in Section One: Laws and Rules).  You can find the 
basic Rule 8.3 process in Section Two of the Contested Divorce Informational Guide at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/divorce.  

PART THREE: DISCOVERY; FILING OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT; FILING OF 
ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM 

You May Begin the Discovery Process: 

Once the legal separation starts, both spouses may begin the discovery process. 

Discovery is a formal process where the Plaintiff and Defendant ask each other for information.  
The Plaintiff and Defendant may also ask non-parties for information. 

For more information about discovery, see the “Discovery” Section of the Guide to Civil Action 
at Guide to a District Court Civil Action. 

File the Summons and Complaint and Proof of Service: 

Filing is bringing or sending documents to the Clerk of District Court’s office and asking the clerk 
to file the documents.  The filing fee is paid before the documents are accepted for filing. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

26 

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

Although filing isn’t required to start a legal separation action, there are actions that a court 
can’t take until the summons and complaint are filed.  For example, if you need to request 
something from the court, such as an order or a subpoena, the summons and complaint is filed 
first. 

File the following completed, original documents with the Clerk of District Court and pay the 
$80.00 filing fee:  

•  Summons 
•  Complaint 
•  Affidavit of Custody Jurisdiction 

o  ONLY required if minor or dependent children are part of the legal separation 

action and the affidavit information wasn’t included in the complaint. 
•  Proof of Service of Summons, Complaint and Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Custody Jurisdiction 

on Defendant 

You may ask the court to waive the $80.00 filing fee due to financial hardship.  Forms to request 
the fee waiver are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. 

If the Clerk of District Court accepts your documents for filing, a case number will be assigned. 

Notice of Filing the Summons and Complaint: 

The spouse who filed the above documents must serve notice of filing on the other spouse.  See 
the “Notice of Filing form” available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/general-use-forms. 

For more information about filing documents in a civil court action, including when the 
Defendant may file the summons and complaint, see the “Filing Documents with the District 
Court” section of the Guide to Civil Action at Guide to a District Court Civil Action. 

The Defendant Files the Answer and Counterclaim: 

Within a reasonable time after receiving notice of filing of the summons and complaint, the 
Defendant must file the following completed, original documents with the Clerk of District 
Court and pay the $50.00 filing fee:  

•  Answer and Counterclaim 
•  Defendant’s Affidavit of Custody Jurisdiction (if minor or dependent children are part of 

the legal separation action and the affidavit information wasn’t included in the 
counterclaim part of the answer and counterclaim.) 

•  Proof of Service of Answer and Counterclaim, and Defendant’s Affidavit of Custody 

Jurisdiction on Plaintiff 

•  Defendant’s Confidential Information Form

Within 10 days of filing the case, you may be referred to the Family Mediation Program for 
mediation of the disputed or unresolved parental rights and responsibilities issues.  

The Family Law Mediation Program will provide up to 6 hours of combined pre-mediation 
orientation and mediation at no cost to the spouses. 

If your case is referred to the Family Mediation Program, you’ll receive an order and schedule 
for mediation. Read the order and schedule carefully, as you’ll need to follow the requirements 
and meet the deadlines. 

For more information about the Family Mediation Program, go to www.ndcourts.gov/state-
court-administration/family-law-mediation-program. 

Either Spouse May Request an Interim or Temporary Order: 

Review Rule 8.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

Generally, either spouse can request an interim order after a legal separation case is served and 
filed. 

This is a request for a temporary order for any of the following: 

•  Support; 
•  Parental rights and responsibilities; 
•  Attorney’s fees and costs; and 
•  Use of property. 

The interim order, if signed by the court, is in effect until there is a different or final decision in 
the legal separation action.

Informational guides to making a motion and answering a motion for an interim order is 
available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/temporary-orders. 

The informational guides include: 

•  The basic steps for making a motion and answering a motion for an interim order. 
•  Formatting examples of the common motion and answer to motion for an interim order 

documents. 

Appointment of a Parenting Investigator or Guardian Ad Litem for the Child(ren): 

Review § 14-09-06.3 and § 14-09-06.4 of the North Dakota Century Code.  Review Rule 8.6 and 
Rule 8.11 of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

When one of the contested issues in a legal separation action is parenting rights and 
responsibilities, either spouse may petition the court to appoint a parenting investigator or a 
guardian ad litem to represent the child concerning parenting rights and responsibilities. 

The court may require one or both spouses to pay the guardian ad litem or investigator fees. 

If neither spouse is able to pay the fees, the court may require that the county pay the fees, in 
whole or in part. The court may then require one or both spouses to reimburse the county, in 
whole or in part, for payment of the fees. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions for petitioning the court to 
appoint a parenting investigator or a guardian ad litem for the child(ren). 

For more information about making and answering motions in a civil action, including the type 
of documents you’ll need to create, go to: 

•  “Making a Motion” at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/making-a-motion. 
•  “Answering a Motion” at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/answering-a-motion. 

Prepare Proposed Parenting Plans: 

If your legal separation action involves minor or dependent children, a parenting plan is 
required to be part of the final legal separation judgment. 

If you and your spouse don’t agree to a parenting plan, you’ll each likely need to prepare a 
proposed parenting plan as part of the legal separation process. 

The State Bar Association of North Dakota created a Model North Dakota Parenting Plan that 
may be of interest to you.  It is found in the Parenting Plan section of the Legal Services of 
North Dakota Family Law Manual.  It is also found in the Forms section of the State Bar 
Association of North Dakota website at www.sband.org.

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

Spouses May Settle All or Part of the Issues in the Legal Separation: 

At any point during the legal separation case, spouses may discuss settlement of all or part of 
the issues. 

If you and your spouse reach an agreement on an issue, prepare a written settlement 
agreement.  This may also be referred to as a stipulation or a stipulated agreement.  Written 
settlement agreements must be signed by both spouses. 

Written settlement agreements are filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Spouses May Request, or the Court May Order, a Pre-Trial Conference: 

Review Rule 16 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Either spouse may request a pre-trial conference in writing.  The court may order a pre-trial 
conference.  Rule 16 lists the events that, if triggered, require the court to schedule a pre-trial 
conference. Depending on the circumstances of the legal separation case, more than one pre-
trial conference may be required. 

The purpose of the pre-trial conference is: 

•  To expedite disposition of the legal separation case; 
•  To establish early and continuing control so that the legal separation case won’t be 

drawn-out because of lack of management; 

•  To discourage wasteful pre-trial activities; 
•  To improve the quality of the trial through more thorough preparation; 
•  To facilitate settlement; and 
•  To discuss the desirability of using alternative dispute resolution. 

o 

Information about Alternative Dispute Resolution is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov. 

At any pre-trial conference, the court may consider and take appropriate action on the matters 
and issues listed in Rule 16. 

After any pre-trial conference, the court must issue an order detailing the action taken. 

Read the order and schedule carefully, as you’ll need to follow the requirements and meet the 
deadlines.

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

Prepare for and Attend All Scheduled Hearings: 

Various types of hearings may occur throughout your legal separation action. 

For example, you may have a hearing on a motion for an interim order, a scheduling 
conference, or a pre-trial conference. 

You must attend all hearings that are scheduled unless you have received permission from the 
court not to attend. 

You can ask the court for permission to attend a hearing by telephone or by some other reliable 
electronic means.  The court isn’t required to grant this type of request.  Forms and instructions 
for this request can be found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking on the “Appear by 
Phone or Other Electronic Means Request” link under “Miscellaneous.” 

If You Need Special Assistance at the Hearings: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of Court’s office as soon as possible. 

PART FIVE: PRE-TRIAL  PREPARATION 

If you and your spouse don’t reach a settlement on all issues, your legal separation action will 
eventually go to trial.  Issues on which you and your spouse don’t agree will be decided by a 
District Court Judge or Judicial Referee. 

Caution!  Preparing for trial is often a complex and confusing process.  You’re held to the same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or 
procedures.  This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You’ll need to 
conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

Library Resources: (Not all legal resources are available online.) 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (www.odin.nodak.edu) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

Finish Your Pre-Trial Preparations: 

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully!  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence 
govern whether your evidence is admitted at trial.  The Rules also govern how you object to 
evidence your spouse wants to admit at trial. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking 

on the "Evidence" link under “District Court Civil.” 

Review Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully!  If you require a witness 
to appear at trial or require production of documents, electronically stored information or 
other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District Court to issue a subpoena.  Only a 
Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

•  A Subpoena Informational Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by 

clicking on the "Subpoenas" link under “District Court Civil. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the trial.  At minimum, 
prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

PART SIX: TRIAL 

The trial is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the judge or judicial referee.  
The trial is the final hearing in a legal separation action.  The decision of the judge or judicial 
referee is called a judgment. 

Caution!  Representing yourself at trial is often a complex and confusing process.  You’re held 
to the same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the 
rules or procedures.  This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You’ll need 
to conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review the Library Resources above in Part Five: Pre-Trial Preparation. 

If you need special assistance at the Trial: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of Court’s office as soon as possible. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Trial: 

Don’t miss your trial date and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to 
court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the Clerk of District Court as soon as you can. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

33 

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

Bring the Information, Documents, Etc. You Prepared for the Trial: 

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc., that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
trial. Bring the outline of what you want to say.  

Conduct of the Trial: 

In a legal separation trial, the judge or judicial referee hears both sides and then issues a final 
judgment.  Sometimes, the final judgment is issued at the end of the trial.  Often the final 
judgment is issued at a later date. 

Before the trial officially begins: 

•  Organize your files and paperwork on your assigned table in the courtroom so you can 

easily locate information as needed. 

In general, a trial in a legal separation action proceeds in the following order:  

• 

Judge or Judicial Referee Begins the Trial 

o  The trial officially begins when all are asked to rise when the judge or judicial 

referee comes into the courtroom. 

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each spouse gives an opening statement.  Usually, the Plaintiff goes first. 

•  Plaintiff Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Plaintiff presents their case first.  The Defendant may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the Plaintiff’s evidence. 

•  Defendant Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Defendant presents their case after the Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff may cross-

examine witnesses and object to the Defendant’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each spouse gives a closing argument.  Usually, the Plaintiff goes first.  

Before You Leave the Courthouse: 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next.

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

PART SEVEN: FINAL JUDGMENT 

You aren’t legally separated until a final judgment of legal separation is signed by the judge or 
judicial referee and filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment: 

Review Rule 52 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court carefully! 

Findings of fact are the judge’s or judicial referee’s written determination of the facts made 
from the evidence presented. This explains what facts the judge or judicial referee found to be 
true. 

Conclusions of law are the rulings of law made by the judge or judicial referee based on, or in 
connection with, the findings of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the judge or 
judicial referee found to be true. 

If your legal separation action involves minor or dependent children, the parenting plan must 
be included in the conclusions of law, or incorporated by reference into the conclusions of law 
if the parenting plan is a separate document. 

The judge or judicial referee may require one or both spouses to prepare and file proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order for judgment.  The proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and an order for judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of 
service filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

The judge or judicial referee will decide whether the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order for judgment are appropriate.  If the judge or judicial referee decides they are 
appropriate, the judge or judicial referee will sign and date the findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order for judgment. 

The findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment aren’t official until signed and 
dated by the judge or judicial referee. 

Proposed Judgment: 

Review Rule 54 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court carefully! 

The judgment is the written order of the judge’s or judicial referee’s final decision in your legal 
separation action. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

35 

Legal Separation/Rev Dec 2019 

If your legal separation action involves minor or dependent children, the parenting plan must 
be included in the judgment, or incorporated by reference into the judgment if the parenting 
plan is a separate document. 

The judge or judicial referee may require one or both spouses to prepare and file a proposed 
judgment.  The proposed judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of service filed 
with the Clerk of District Court. 

The judge or judicial referee will decide whether the proposed judgment is appropriate.  If the 
judge or judicial referee decides it is appropriate, the clerk of court will sign and date the 
judgment. 

You aren’t legally separated until a final judgment of legal separation is signed by the clerk of 
court and filed with the District Court. 

Notice of Entry of Judgment 

Review Rule 58 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Within 14 days after the judgment is entered, the prevailing spouse must serve notice of entry 
of judgment on the other spouse.  A copy of the judgment must be included with the notice of 
entry of judgment.  See the “Notice of Entry of Judgment form” at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-
self-help/general-use-forms. 

After service is complete, the prevailing spouse must file the original, completed Notice of Entry 
of Judgment and proof of service on the other spouse with the Clerk of District Court.  

PART EIGHT (OPTIONAL):  REVOCATION OF DECREE OF SEPARATION 

After a North Dakota District Court grants a decree or judgment of legal separation, either 
spouse may apply to the court to revoke the decree of legal separation and request a divorce 
decree. 

The requirements for revoking a decree of legal separation are contained in this North Dakota 
Century Code Chapter 14-05.  Section 14-05-29 includes requirements for applications for 
revocation of a decree of legal separation and request for a divorce decree. 

Copies of the application documents must be served on your spouse at least ten (10) days, but 
not more than twenty (20) days, before filing the application with the court. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions for applying for a revocation 
of a decree of legal separation and requesting a divorce decree. 

You’ll need to create your own legal documents, should you decide to make a request yourself.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
