Important Notices 

When a North Dakota Administrative Agency decision is appealed or petitioned 
for review to a North Dakota state district court, the Appellant/Petitioner may 
ask the District Court to waive two of the costs associated with the appeal or 
petition.   

The two costs are: 

1.  Filing fees; and 

2.  Preparation of the record of the administrative agency proceedings.   

The District Court may grant the waivers if the Appellant/Petitioner shows 
they are unable to pay. 

You may use these forms if you are unable to afford the filing fees or the costs 
of preparing the record of the administrative agency proceedings. 

  Every person who appears in court without a lawyer is expected to know  and 

follow the laws, rules, and procedures. 

  ND Legal Self Help Center staff and Court staff can’t help you fill out the 

form(s) in this packet. 

  You must fill out all forms included with this packet and you must follow 

the instructions included with this packet. 

  You should see a lawyer if you don’t know how to answer the questions on 

these forms or if you think the other party will hire a lawyer. 

  Type your answers or hand-write neatly using dark ink.  (Hand-written 

forms must be readable.) 

Appeals of administrative agency final decisions to North Dakota state district 
court are publically accessible case records.  Anyone can request to look at the 
case records in appeals of administrative agency final decisions. 

This packet of forms to waive filing fees/transcript fees is filed as a public case 
record, which means anyone can request to look at the forms you file.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
