INFORMATION ABOUT CONTESTED PARENTING RIGHTS AND 
RESPONSBILITIES IN NORTH DAKOTA 

WHAT IS A CONTESTED PARENTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSBILITIES ACTION? 

Parents who have never been married to each other may ask a North Dakota state district 
court to establish parenting rights and responsibilities to their children.  (Generally, 
establishing parenting rights and responsibilities between parents who are or were married to 
each other are part of divorce or legal separation proceedings.) 

If you and the other parent aren’t in agreement on every issue in establishing parenting rights 
and responsibilities, you have a contested parenting rights and responsibilities action. 

WHAT IF PATERNITY HASN’T BEEN ESTABLISHED? 

If a father-child relationship hasn’t been established, you may need to bring a different type 
of civil action to establish paternity.  Residential responsibility (custody) and parenting time 
(visitation) may be established as part of a paternity action. 

The father-child relationship is established by: 

•  An acknowledgment of paternity 

o  A process that occurs shortly after birth that requires signatures on a form from 
the mother, father, and, if the mother is married, the husband.  Then, the 
father’s name is added to the birth certificate. 

•  A civil action to establish paternity 

o  A civil action that establishes the father of a child that may involve genetic 

testing.  A court issues an order establishing paternity so that the father’s name 
can be added to the birth certificate. 

•  Adoption 

o  A civil action that terminates the parental rights of a parent, or parents, of a child 
and establishes another individual, or individuals, as the parent.  A court issues 
an adoption order so that the new birth certificate is issued for the child.  The 
new birth certificate lists the adoptive parent’s name, or names. 

If the father-child relationship hasn’t been established, go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/paternity for all of the information about paternity actions available through the ND Legal 
Self Help Center.

Contested PRR /Rev. Jul 2021 

HOW IS MATERNITY ESTABLISHED? 

If a mother-child relationship hasn’t been established, you may need to bring a different type 
of civil action to establish maternity. 

The mother-child relationship is established by: 

•  Giving birth to the child 
•  A civil action to establish maternity 

o  A civil action that establishes the mother of a child.  A court issues an order 
establishing maternity so that the mother’s name can be added to the birth 
certificate. 

•  Adoption 

o  A civil action that terminates the parental rights of a parent, or parents, of a child 
and establishes another individual, or individuals, as the parent.  A court issues 
an adoption order so that the new birth certificate is issued for the child.  The 
new birth certificate lists the adoptive parent’s name, or names. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE CONTESTED PARENTING RIGHTS 
AND RESPONSIBILTIES FORMS? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have a packet of forms for contested parenting 
rights and responsibilities actions. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own contested parenting rights 
and responsibilities documents.  The names and descriptions of the documents you’ll need to 
create are found throughout this guide. 

Formatting examples of some of the contested parenting rights and responsibilities documents 
are found in the Appendix at the end of this guide. 

The General-Use template forms are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the 
“District Court Civil” section.  You may find the General-Use forms of interest as a starting point 
for creating your own parenting rights and responsibilities documents. 

You may find the forms in the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual of interest.  
The Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual contains a variety of divorce forms that 
were created for lawyers to use as examples in family law cases.  The Legal Services of North 
Dakota website is www.legalassist.org.

content or uses of the Family Law Manual. You must independently determine the legal 
sufficiency of the forms in the Family Law Manual.  Use at your own risk.)  

IS THERE HELP AVAILABLE FOR CREATING LEGAL DOCUMENTS? 

If you would like assistance creating your contested parenting rights and responsibilities 
documents, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to practice in North 
Dakota may agree to help you with part of your contested parenting rights and responsibilities 
action, such as preparing legal documents, while you handle the rest of the action.  You and the 
lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation. 

WHAT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TERMS IN A 
PARENTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACTION? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they aren’t intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Child Support – payments for the support of a child, including payments for health insurance 
coverage or other medical support, and payments for the support of spouses or former spouses 
with whom the child is living as long as the spousal support payment is owed to the spouse or 
former spouse under the same order as the payments for the child, if the payment is required 
by the order of a court or other governmental agency having authority to issue such orders, and 
includes past-due support. 

Custody – See residential responsibility. 

Decision making responsibility – The responsibility to make decisions concerning the child.  The 
term may refer to decisions on all issues or on specific issues, but not child support issues. 

Deploying or deployed parent – a deploying or deployed parent is a uniformed service member 
who has been notified of orders of movement or mobilization for more than ninety days but 
less than eighteen months AND the orders are designated as unaccompanied, not authorized 
for dependent travel, or don’t permit family members to move to the deployment location. 

Home state – The state in which a child lived with a parent for at least six consecutive months 
immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.  In the case of a child 
less than six months of age, home state means the state in which the child lived from birth with 
a parent.  A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period.

Obligor – the person ordered by the court to pay child support or spousal support. 

Obligee – the person receiving child support or spousal support ordered by the court. 

Parental rights and responsibilities – All the rights and responsibilities a parent has concerning 
the parent's child. 

Parenting plan – A written plan describing each parent's rights and responsibilities.  A parenting 
plan must be included in the court’s final judgment to establish parenting rights and 
responsibilities between parents who were never married to each other. 

Parenting schedule – The schedule of when the child is in the care of each parent. 

Parenting time – The time when the child is to be in the care of a parent. (Also known as

responsibility. 

Residency requirement – the amount of time a child and parent must live in North Dakota 
before they can ask a North Dakota district court to establish parenting rights and 
responsibilities between parents who were never married to each other.  To determine 
whether your circumstances meet the North Dakota residency requirements, see the “What is 
the North Dakota Residency Requirement for Establishing Parenting Rights and Responsibilities” 
section below. 

Residential responsibility – A parent's responsibility to provide a home for the child. (Also 
known as custody.) 

Visitation – See parenting time. 

WHO ARE THE PARTIES IN A PARENTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
ACTION? 

Plaintiff (or Petitioner) – The parent who starts the contested parenting rights and 
responsibilities action by serving a summons and complaint to establish parenting rights and 
responsibilities on the other parent. 

Defendant (or Respondent) – The parent who is served the summons and complaint to 
establish parenting rights and responsibilities by the other parent. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Contested PRR /Rev. Jul 2021 

Real Party in Interest (also known as the Statutory Real Party in Interest) – The State of North 
Dakota is added as a real party in interest to parenting rights and responsibilities actions only 
when: 

•  Child support will be established or modified and a minor child receives assistance 

through programs administered by the North Dakota Department of Human Services, 
such as temporary assistance to needy families, Medicaid, and foster care; or 

•  Child support will be established or modified and an application was made and accepted 
for services provided by the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of 
Human Services; or 

•  Child support will be established or modified and North Dakota or the Child Support 

Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services is required to be involved 
in proceedings related to support orders of other states or countries under the Uniform 
Interstate Family Support Act. 

WHAT IS THE NORTH DAKOTA RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT FOR ESTABLISHING 
PARENTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES? 

Chapter 14-14.1 of the North Dakota Century Code governs which state can make decisions 
about child custody issues and enforce child custody orders. 

A North Dakota District Court can establish parenting rights and responsibilities to a minor child 
when:  

•  North Dakota is the home state of the child on the date the parenting rights and 

responsibilities action starts; or 

•  North Dakota was the home state of the child within six months before the date the 

parenting rights and responsibilities action started, and the child is absent from North 
Dakota but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in North Dakota; or 

•  North Dakota isn’t the home state, but a court of the child’s home state declined 

jurisdiction because North Dakota is the more appropriate forum, and: 

o  The child and the child's parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person 
acting as a parent, have a significant connection with North Dakota other than 
mere physical presence; and 

o  Substantial evidence is available in North Dakota concerning the child's care, 

protection, training, and personal relationships.

WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO ESTABLISHING 
PARENTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES? 

Interpreting what the law means for a specific set of circumstances is a fundamental part of 
legal representation.  ND Legal Self Help Center staff can’t provide legal representation of any 
kind under any circumstances.  Legal representation can only be provided to you by an attorney 
who has agreed to represent you. 

Chapter 14-09 of the North Dakota Century Code governs parenting rights and responsibilities, 
such as custody, visitation, and child support.  Review the entire Chapter.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c09.html 

Chapter 14-12.2 of the North Dakota Century Code governs enforcement and modification of 
child support and spousal support orders issued by other states or countries.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c12-2.html 

Chapter 14-14.1 of the North Dakota Century Code governs which state can make decisions 
about child custody issues and enforce child custody orders.  You’ll need to determine if a 
North Dakota District Court can establish parenting rights and responsibilities to your child.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c14-1.html 

Chapter 14-09, 14-12.2 and 14-14.1 are Chapters within Title 14 of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  There are many other laws related to families in Title 14.  You may find them of interest.  
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14.html 

The North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to civil matters in North Dakota district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp.   

The North Dakota Rules of Court apply to civil matters in North Dakota district courts.  The 
rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct.   

 See particularly:  

•  Rule 8.2 (Interim Orders), 
•  Rule 8.3.1 (Case Management), and 
•  Rule 8.4 (Summons). 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to civil matters in North Dakota district courts.  The 
rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev.   

North Dakota case law is useful for interpreting what the law means for your individual 
circumstances.

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North Dakota 
Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

One way to research case law related to parenting rights and responsibilities, is to use the print 
version of the North Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each 
Section of the Century Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of 
the Century Code Section. 

To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court 
Opinions” link and enter the case name or case citation. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions).  Print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code and court rules are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

WHAT ARE COMMON ISSUES IN A PARENTING RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
ACTION?  

•  Residential responsibility of children, also known as custody 
•  Parenting time, also known as visitation 
•  Decision making responsibilities 
•  Child support 
•  Medical coverage, including health insurance premiums, copays, deductibles, etc. 
•  Tax deductions 

When parents can’t agree on residential responsibility and parenting time, the court will decide 
based on the best interests of the children.  The best interest factors are found in § 14-09-06.2 
of the North Dakota Century Code.

Child Support: 

WARNING: If you don’t want to establish child support as part of your case, the court will still 
require you to complete the child support calculations.  The court will ultimately decide 
whether to hold off on payment of the child support amount.  Usually, the court will wait to 
decide until after the Child Support Division tells the court whether they agree. 

Child support is based on guidelines set by the North Dakota Department of Human Services.  If 
a parent can show a different ability to earn income than the guidelines show, the court may 
order a higher or lower child support payment. 

The Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services created and 
provides support for the Child Support Guidelines Calculator. The Calculator can be found at 
childsupport.dhs.nd.gov/lawyers/child-support-guidelines. 

The Child Support Division may be able to provide some assistance with your child support 
calculations. (701-328-5440; 800-231-4255) 

Court personnel and staff of the ND Legal Self Help Center can’t assist with child support 
calculations. 

WARNING: If you plan to ask the court to allow a parent to pay a different amount of child 
support than the Child Support Guidelines Calculator amount, you’re strongly urged to consult 
a lawyer for assistance.  The Calculator amount is presumed to be the correct amount of child 
support.  The parent asking for a deviation from the Calculator amount must prove they meet 
one of the limited exceptions for deviation, and the deviation is in the best interests of the 
child(ren).  See North Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-09.7 and North Dakota 
Administrative Code Section 75-02-04.1-09.

the case the lawyer handled. For example:

•  You can consult with a lawyer to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend 

rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with a 

lawyer who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire a lawyer just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

appoint a parenting investigator or a guardian ad litem to represent the child concerning 
parenting rights and responsibilities. 

The court may require one or both parents to pay the guardian ad litem or investigator fees.

Contested PRR /Rev. Jul 2021 

If neither parent is able to pay the fees, the court may require that the county pay the fees, in 
whole or in part. The court may then require one or both parents to reimburse the county, in 
whole or in part, for payment of the fees. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions for petitioning the court to 
appoint a parenting investigator or a guardian ad litem for the child(ren). 

For more information about making and answering motions in a civil action, including the type 
of documents you’ll need to create, go to: 

•  “Making a Motion” at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/making-a-motion. 
•  “Answering a Motion” at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/answering-a-motion. 

Prepare Proposed Parenting Plans: 

A parenting plan is required to be part of the final parenting rights and responsibilities 
judgment. 

If you and the other parent don’t agree to a parenting plan, you’ll each likely need to prepare a 
proposed parenting plan as part of the contested parenting rights and responsibilities 
proceedings. 

The State Bar Association of North Dakota created a Model North Dakota Parenting Plan that 
may be of interest to you.  It’s found in the Parenting Plan section of the Legal Services of North 
Dakota Family Law Manual.  It’s also found on the State Bar Association of North Dakota 
website of www.sband.org. 

Parents May Settle All or Part of the Issues in the Contested Parenting Rights and 
Responsibilities Action: 

At any point during the contested parenting rights and responsibilities action, parents may 
discuss settlement of all or part of the issues. 

If you and the other parent reach an agreement on an issue, prepare a written settlement 
agreement.  This may also be referred to as a stipulation or a stipulated agreement.  Written 
settlement agreements must be signed by both parents in the presence of a notary public. 

Written settlement agreements are filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Prepare for and Attend All Scheduled Hearings: 

Various types of hearings may occur throughout your contested parenting rights and 
responsibilities action.  For example, you may have a hearing on a motion for an interim order, 
a scheduling conference, or a pre-trial conference. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 28 of 34 

Contested PRR /Rev. Jul 2021 

You must attend all hearings that are scheduled unless you’ve received permission from the 
court not to attend. 

You can ask the court for permission to attend a hearing by telephone or by some other reliable 
electronic means.  The court isn’t required to grant this type of request.  Forms and instructions 
for this request can be found at Appear by Phone or Other Electronic Means Request. 

PART FIVE: PRE-TRIAL PREPARATION 

If you and the other parent don’t reach a settlement on all issues, your contested parenting 
rights and responsibilities action will eventually go to trial.  Issues on which you and the other 
parent don’t agree will be decided by a District Court Judge or a Judicial Referee. 

Caution!  Preparing for trial is often a complex and confusing process.  You’re held to same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or procedures.  
This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You’ll need to conduct additional 
research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

Library Resources: (Not all legal resources are available online.) 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (www.odin.nodak.edu) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

procedures.  This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You’ll need to 
conduct additional research to prepare.

forward with the trial as scheduled. 

Bring the Information, Documents, Etc. you Prepared for the Trial:

both sides and then issues a final judgment.  Sometimes, the final judgment is issued at the end 
of the trial.  Often, the final judgment is issued at a later date. 

Before the trial officially begins: 

•  Organize your files and paperwork on your assigned table in the courtroom so you can 

easily locate information as needed.

need to do next. 

PART SEVEN: FINAL PARENTING RESPONSIBILITY JUDGMENT 

Parenting rights and responsibilities aren’t established until a final judgment establishing 
parenting rights and responsibilities is signed by the judge or judicial referee and filed with the 
Clerk of District Court. 

Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment: 

Review Rule 52 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court carefully! 

Findings of fact are the judge’s or judicial referee’s written determination of the facts made 
from the evidence presented. This explains what facts the judge or judicial referee found to be 
true. 

Conclusions of law are the rulings of law made by the judge or judicial referee based on, or in 
connection with, the findings of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the judge or 
judicial referee found to be true. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 32 of 34 

Contested PRR /Rev. Jul 2021 

The parenting plan must be included in the conclusions of law, or incorporated by reference 
into the conclusions of law, if the parenting plan is a separate document. 

The judge or judicial referee may require one or both parents to prepare and file proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order for judgment.  The proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions of law and an order for judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of 
service filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

The judge or judicial referee will decide whether the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order for judgment are appropriate.  If the judge or judicial referee decides they are 
appropriate, the judge or judicial referee will sign and date the findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order for judgment. 

The findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment aren’t official until signed and 
dated by the judge or judicial referee. 

Proposed Judgment: 

Review Rule 54 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court carefully! 

The judgment is the written order of the judge’s or judicial referee’s final decision in your 
contested parenting rights and responsibilities action.

judgment.  The proposed judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of service filed 
with the Clerk of District Court.

judge or judicial referee decides it’s appropriate, the judge or judicial referee will sign and date 
the judgment.
