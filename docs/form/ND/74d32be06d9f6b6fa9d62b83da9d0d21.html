      <pre>STARTING A CONSERVATORSHIP CASE FOR AN ADULT OR MINOR CHILD 
CHECKLIST 
 
This is a basic checklist for starting a conservatorship case in District Court.  Starting a 
conservatorship case can be quite complicated.  Depending on the circumstances, there may 
be additional documents and procedures not included on this checklist.  If you’re unsure how 
to proceed, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center can provide basic process information.  The Center 
can’t give you legal advice or act as your lawyer under any circumstances. 

THE “STARTING A DISTRICT COURT CIVIL ACTION” PAGE on the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website has additional information and resources. 

UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW – CAUTION! 

This checklist may be used by a Petitioner who is a natural person.  In other words, a 
human being.  A natural person can perform the functions of a lawyer for themselves at 
their own risk.  This is called legal self-representation. 

This checklist may not be used on behalf of a Petitioner who is an artificial person. In 
other words, an entity created by law, such as a business, a corporation or a limited 
liability company.  In general, an artificial person can’t be represented in a North Dakota 
state district court by a non-lawyer.  This is called unauthorized practice of law. 

If the Petitioner is an artificial person, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.  Contact the State Bar Association of North Dakota Lawyer Referral Service at 
(866) 450-9579.  An online directory of all lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota is 
available at www.ndcourts.gov/lawyers. 

What is a Conservatorship?  

A conservatorship is a court process to decide whether an adult or a minor child can’t manage 
their property or financial affairs to the point where a conservator must be appointed to take 
either limited or full control. 

The court process involves presenting evidence to a North Dakota state district court judge or 
judicial referee to show that the requirements of North Dakota Century Code Chapter 30.1-29 
are met and a conservator should be appointed.  Other parties in the conservatorship case, 
including the adult or minor child, may present their own evidence.

When Can the District Court Appoint a Conservator for a Minor Child?

one of the following, the judge or judicial referee will appoint a conservator for a minor child: 

1.  The minor child “owns money or property that requires management or protection 
which cannot otherwise be provided, has or may have business affairs which may be 
jeopardized or prevented by the minor's minority, or that funds are needed for the 
minor's support and education and that protection is necessary or desirable to obtain or 
provide funds.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-01(1)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by a preponderance of the evidence. 
•  A guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the minor child may be 

appointed by the judge or judicial referee.  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(1)) 

2.  The minor child “is unable to manage [their] property and affairs effectively for reasons 
such as mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, chronic use of 
drugs, or chronic intoxication.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-01(2)(a)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by clear and convincing evidence.

(N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(3)) 

3.  The minor child “is unable to manage [their] property and affairs effectively for reasons 
of confinement, detention by a foreign power, or disappearance.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-
01(2)(b)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by clear and convincing evidence. 
•  A guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the minor child may be 

appointed by the judge or judicial referee.  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(2)) 

4.  The minor child “has property that will be wasted or dissipated unless proper 

management is provided, or that funds are needed for the support, care, and welfare of 
the [minor] or those entitled to be supported by the [minor] and that protection is 
necessary or desirable to obtain or provide funds.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-01(2)(c)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by clear and convincing evidence.

When Can the District Court Appoint a Conservator for an Adult?  

If the Petitioner, the person asking the District Court to appoint a conservator, proves at least 
one of the following, the judge or judicial referee will appoint a conservator for an adult: 

1.  The adult “is unable to manage [their] property and affairs effectively for reasons such 

as mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, or 
chronic intoxication.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-01(2)(a)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by clear and convincing evidence. 
•  A guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the adult may be 
appointed by the judge or judicial referee.  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(2)) 
•  An expert examiner must be appointed by the judge or judicial referee.  

(N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(3)) 

2.  The adult “is unable to manage [their] property and affairs effectively for reasons of 
confinement, detention by a foreign power, or disappearance.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-
01(2)(b)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by clear and convincing evidence. 
•  A guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the adult may be 
appointed by the judge or judicial referee.  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(2)) 

3.  The adult “has property that will be wasted or dissipated unless proper management is 
provided, or that funds are needed for the support, care, and welfare of the [adult] or 
those entitled to be supported by the [adult] and that protection is necessary or 
desirable to obtain or provide funds.”  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-01(2)(c)) 

•  The Petitioner must prove this by clear and convincing evidence. 
•  A guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the adult may be 
appointed by the judge or judicial referee.  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(2)) 

What is Preponderance of the Evidence?  

Preponderance of the evidence is the burden of proof by which the Petitioner must convince 
the judge or judicial referee that a conservator should be appointed for a minor child when the 
reason is Number 1 in the “When Can the District Court Appoint a Conservator for a Minor 
Child” section above. 

Black’s Law Dictionary (9th Edition, 2009) partially defines preponderance of the evidence as 
“the greater weight of the evidence, not necessarily established by the greater number of 
witnesses testifying to a fact but by evidence that has the most convincing force.” 

NDLSHC Website: 
www.ndcourts.gov

Starting Conservatorship Case/Dec 2021 

What is Clear and Convincing Evidence?  

Clear and convincing evidence is the burden of proof by which the Petitioner must convince the 
judge or judicial referee that a conservator should be appointed for an adult or a minor child 
when the reason is Number 2, 3 or 4 in the “When Can the District Court Appoint a Conservator 
for a Minor Child” section above; or Number 1, 2 or 3 in the “When Can the District Court 
Appoint a Conservator for an Adult” section above. 

Black’s Law Dictionary (9th Edition, 2009) partially defines clear and convincing evidence as 
“evidence indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain.  This is 
a greater burden than preponderance of the evidence, . . . but less than beyond a reasonable 
doubt, the norm for criminal trials.” 

Who Can Petition to Start a Conservatorship Case?  

The Petitioner, the person asking the District Court to appoint a conservator, can be any of the 
following (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-04(1)): 

•  The adult or the minor child whose property or financial affairs would be protected.  

(Also called the proposed protected person, or the person to be protected.) 

•  The adult or minor child’s parent. 
•  The adult or minor child’s guardian. 
•  The adult or minor child’s custodian. 
•  Any person who is interested in the estate, affairs, or welfare of the adult or minor child. 
•  Any person who would be adversely affected by lack of effective management of the 

property or financial affairs of the adult or minor child. 

Who Can Be Appointed the Conservator?  

The following may be appointed the conservator and are listed in order of priority (N.D.C.C. § 
30.1-29-10): 

1.  The person most recently nominated by the adult to be protected in a durable power of 

attorney. 

2.  The conservator, guardian of property, or other like fiduciary appointed or recognized 
by the appropriate court of another jurisdiction where the adult or minor child to be 
protected resides. 

3.  An individual or corporation nominated by the adult or minor child to be protected in 

other than a durable power of attorney, if the adult or minor child has sufficient mental 
capacity to make an intelligent choice. 

NDLSHC Website: 
www.ndcourts.gov 

Page 4 of 8 

Starting Conservatorship Case/Dec 2021 

4.  The spouse of the adult or minor child to be protected. 
5.  An adult child of the adult to be protected. 
6.  A parent of the adult or minor child to be protected. 
7.  A person nominated by the deceased parent of an adult or minor child to be protected 

in the parent’s will. 

8.  Any relative of the adult or minor child to be protected with whom the adult or minor 

child has resided for more than 6 months prior to filing the petition for conservatorship. 

9.  A person nominated by the person who is caring for or paying benefits to the adult or 

minor child to be protected. 

If the Petitioner nominates a proposed conservator with lower priority, at minimum the 
Petitioner must show the court that their proposed conservator is best qualified. 

Venue (Location of the Conservatorship Case within North Dakota):  

The Petitioner must decide the proper county in North Dakota for a North Dakota State District 
Court to hear and decide the conservatorship case. 

The proper county is either (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-03): 

  The District Court in _____________________ County, where the adult or minor child 

resides. 

OR
