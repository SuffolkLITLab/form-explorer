      <pre>How to Ask a Court to End Your Guardianship 

FIRST, ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS: 

1. Did a North Dakota court appoint a guardian for you?

2. Do you want to end your guardianship because you don’t need a

guardian anymore?

If you said YES to both questions, this information will help you understand 

how to ask a North Dakota district court to end your guardianship. 

STEPS FOR ENDING YOUR GUARDIANSHIP 

In North Dakota, ending your guardianship is called “terminating.” 

Since a North Dakota district court appointed your guardian, only the North Dakota 

district court can end, or terminate, your guardianship. 

You will have to ask the North Dakota district court in charge of your guardianship to 

end your guardianship. 

Step One – Write Your Letter    

To ask the North Dakota district court to end your guardianship, send a letter to the 

North Dakota district court in charge of your guardianship. 

If you don’t know which North Dakota district court is in charge of your guardianship, 

look on the first page of the annual report your guardian gave you.  The name of the 

district court and your case number are on the first page. 

You can hand-write or type your letter. 

If you hand-write your letter, make sure you write your words neatly, so your words are 

easy to read.  Use a pen that has blue or black ink.  Do not use a pencil.

You may use the form at the end of these instructions to write your letter. 

In your letter: 

•  Type or write the case number for your guardianship. 

•  Type or write your first and last name. 

•  Type or write your current address. 

•  Type or write your current phone number, if you have one. 

• 

If you have talked to other people or your doctor and they agree with you about 

ending your guardianship, type or write their names and who they are. 

o  If you can, get a letter from each person or your doctor to include with the 

letter you write. 

•  Type or write the reasons you believe you don’t need a guardian anymore. 

o  You can include: 

  Decisions you are making for yourself right now. 

  How you will take care of yourself in the future and make good 

decisions about your life. 

Sign your first, middle, and last name at the bottom of your letter. 

Write the date you signed your letter next to your signature. 

Print your first, middle, and last name after your signature.  

Step Two – Make a Copy of Your Letter; Keep for Your Records    

Make a copy of your letter, or you may have someone you trust make a copy for you. 

If you have letters from other people or your doctor, make a copy of each.

Step Three – Take or Mail Your Letter to the North Dakota District Court    

You may take your letter in-person to the North Dakota district court that is in charge of 

your guardianship. 

Or, you may have someone you trust take your letter in-person. 

If you or someone you trust can’t get to the court in-person, you may mail your letter.

•  Look for the name of the County in the phone book.

address. 

Step Four – Follow the Instructions from the North Dakota District Court   

court, call and ask about your letter. 

After you send your letter to the North Dakota district court, you will get information in 

the mail about your letter.

If the North Dakota district court decides to have a hearing, the information you get in 

the mail will tell you when the hearing will be and where the hearing will be. 

You don’t have to hire a lawyer, but you can choose to hire a lawyer to represent you. 

At the hearing, you will have a chance to show the North Dakota district court why you 

no longer need a guardian.
