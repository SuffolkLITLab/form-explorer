      <pre>SERVICE INFORMATION AFTER CONSERVATORSHIP OF A PROTECTED PERSON 
IS ESTABLISHED BY A NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided is not 
intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you will need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you must abide by the following: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you are held to same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you are unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

This information is not a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about 
the service requirements after a North Dakota state district court established a conservatorship 
of a protected person.  The Center is not responsible for any consequences that may result from 
the information provided.  The information cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel 
licensed in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

 

IMPORTANT – Service is an important step in the legal process. 
Everything filed with the court in the conservatorship case must be served on the 
protected person and all others as required by 
North Dakota Century Code Chapter 30.1-29. 

30.1-29 After Conservatorship Established

Service Info/Nov 2019 

Documents that MUST be served after a conservatorship case has started. 

Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the requirements for the types of 
documents that must be served after a civil action has been started.  Conservatorship cases are 
considered civil actions. 

Generally, each of the following documents must be served under Rule 5 on every person who 
is required to served, unless the rules and laws that apply to conservatorship cases, or the court 
provide otherwise: 

•  An order; 
•  A pleading served after the original notice and petition (see Rule 7 of the North Dakota 

Rules of Civil Procedure for types of documents that are pleadings); 

•  A discovery document required to be served on a party (see Rule 5(d)(3) of the North 
Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for discovery documents that are filed with the court); 

•  A written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; 
•  A written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of judgment, or any similar document; 

and; 

•  Every document filed with the clerk or submitted to the judge. 

Review the North Dakota laws and rules that apply to conservatorship cases.  If a North Dakota 
law or rule tells the specific method of service that must be used, use that method of service. 

If a person who is required to served is not represented by a lawyer, serve the person.  If the 
person who is required to served is known to be represented by a lawyer, serve the lawyer 
instead of the person. 

***In general, copies of documents are served.  Original documents are filed with the court.*** 

Documents that are required to be served MUST be served on ALL persons listed 
in Section 30.1-29-05 of the North Dakota Century Code. 

The following persons listed in Section 30.1-29-05 of the North Dakota Century Code MUST be 
served copies of all documents that are required to be served: 

•  The protected person; 
•  The conservator and any co-conservators; 
•  Any interested persons listed in the court’s order and defined by Section 30.1-01-06(26); 
•  Any other persons listed in the court’s order; and 
•  Any person who has filed a request for notice under Section 30.1-29-06. 

30.1-29 After Conservatorship Established 

Page 2 of 4 

Service Info/Nov 2019 

The person filing the documents is responsible for ensuring the documents are served as 
required by Section 30.1-03-01 and Section 30.1-29-05 of the North Dakota Century Code. 

Proof of service tells the North Dakota state district court how, when and where 
the documents were served. 

If proof of service is not filed, the court will not act on the documents. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  If proof of service is not filed, the 
court will not act on your documents. 

The proof of service tells the court when, how, and where all people required to served were 
served copies of the documents you file. 

•  A certificate of service gives the court proof of service when a sheriff or other officer 

served the documents. 

•  An affidavit of service gives the court proof of service when a person other than a sheriff 

or other officer served the documents. 

Self-Represented parties are not required to serve documents electronically. 

Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure requires electronic service of documents.   

Self-represented parties are exempt from this requirement.  (See Rule 3.5 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court.) 

The person filing the documents, must locate the addresses or locations for service. 

Following are examples of ways to find people for service:  

•  Last known address. 

o  Contact the U.S. Post Office for information on how to determine if the person 

left a forwarding address. 

•  Friends, family, employers. 
•  Online search engines. 
•  Government entities, such as Department of Motor Vehicles or County Recorder. 
•  Social Security Death Index. 
•  Social networking websites. 
•  Reverse directories. 

o  A reverse directory allows someone to search by phone number to find an 
address.  (Your local public library may have access to reverse directories.)

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
