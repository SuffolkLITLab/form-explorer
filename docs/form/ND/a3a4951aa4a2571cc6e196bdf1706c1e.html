WHAT IS AN ADULT GUARDIANSHIP? 

A guardianship of an adult is a court process where a North Dakota state district court judge or 
judicial referee decides that an adult (18 years or older) is incapacitated to the point they’re 
unable to care for themselves responsibly or their incapacity endangers their health or safety. 

A court hearing is required for all adult guardianships. 

If the judge or judicial referee decides, based on the evidence presented, that the adult is 
incapacitated, a guardian is appointed to make medical, legal, residential, educational, 
vocational, and some financial decisions for the adult.  After a guardian is appointed, the adult 
is referred to as the Ward. 

Any person interested in the welfare of an allegedly incapacitated adult person may petition for 
the appointment of a guardian.  An emergency guardian may petition for appointment of a 
long-term guardian.  

LAWS AND RULES 

The requirements for adult guardianships are found in North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.) 
Chapter 30.1-01, Chapter 30.1-03, Chapter 30.1-26 and Chapter 30.1-28.  Refer to these 
Chapters when filling out the forms. 

The qualifications and training requirements for guardians of adults are found in Rule 59 of the 
North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules.  The requirements must be met before a 
court can finalize the appointment of a guardian. 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows a District Court 
Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge, to hear and decide adult guardianship cases. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, administrative 
rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota law can be found 
in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws apply to your situation.

•  Power of attorney; 
•  Health care directive;

GUARDIAN QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 

The proposed guardian must meet the qualifications and training requirements of Rule 59 of 
the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules. 

Review Rule 59 carefully! 

The North Dakota Guardianship Training Course and affidavit forms for the proposed guardian 
are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Scroll to the “Guardians and Conservators” section. 
•  Click on the “Guardianships of Adults” link. 
•  Scroll to the “Guardian Qualifications and Training Requirements” section. 

The affidavit forms and the training course is in the “Rule 59 Guardian Qualifications and 
Training Requirements” section. 

For the cost and process of obtaining a North Dakota criminal history record report, contact the 
Bureau of Criminal Investigation Division of the North Dakota Attorney General.  
(attorneygeneral.nd.gov/public-safety/criminal-history-records) 

The proposed guardian(s) may complete the qualifications and training requirements at any 
point during the process to establish a guardian.  However, the court can’t finalize the 
appointment until the guardian completes the requirements. 

A JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY HEAR AND DECIDE THE GUARDIANSHIP 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows adult guardianship 
cases to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the adult guardianship case, any party to the case may 
request that a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a 
written request with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of 
hearing. 

If the adult guardianship is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will 
issue findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the 
same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court Judge. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 7 of 21 

Est Guardian IA Inst/Rev. Apr 2022 

If any party to the adult guardianship case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of 
fact and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons 
for the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review.  

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review. 

FEES 

A filing fee of $80.00 is required, unless the petition for guardianship is filed by a member of 
the individual treatment plan team for the proposed ward or by any state employee in the 
performance of official duties. 

A petitioner may petition the court to waive the $80.00 filing fee, based on an inability to pay.  
Forms and instructions to petition to waive the filing fee are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-
self-help. Scroll to the “Miscellaneous” section. 

Other fees may apply.  The fees include, but aren’t limited to: 

 

•  Service fees

•  The court must appoint a guardian ad litem, an expert examiner, and a visitor. 

o  The petitioner or the ward’s estate may be required to pay the reasonable fees.   
o  The ward’s estate may pay reasonable fees only if payment will not 

unreasonably jeopardize the ward’s well-being. 

•  The proposed guardian(s) are required to obtain a criminal history record report.  For 

the cost and process of obtaining a North Dakota criminal history record report, contact 
the Bureau of Criminal Investigation Division of the North Dakota Attorney General.

court.  The court may terminate the Guardianship if the Ward no longer meets the standard for 
establishing the Guardianship.
