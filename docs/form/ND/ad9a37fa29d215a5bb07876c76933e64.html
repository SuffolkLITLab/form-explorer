An Informational Guide to North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves 
in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this informational 
guide isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process.  If you 
decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you must abide by the following: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.   This covers basic information for the 
person who has a court judgment against them about the requirements under North Dakota law 
that must be followed when collecting a court judgment.  The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the information provided.  The information can’t replace the 
advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

IMPORTANT! 
When a North Dakota Small Claims or State District Court orders a judgment against 
you (you lose), the person granted the judgment may use a variety of judgment 
collection options to get their money. 

The person granted the judgment MUST follow the requirements of the judgment 
collection option they use.  Following is information about some common judgment 
collection options available under North Dakota law.

CLAIM FOR EXEMPTIONS 

Overview: 

North Dakota law protects certain property to be protected, or exempt, from levy and other 
collection processes.  Exempt property is property under law that you, the Judgment Debtor, 
are allowed to keep.  (See Exempt Assets in the Definitions section.) 

In order to protect the exempt property, you must make a claim for exemptions within a 
specific deadline.  A claim for exemptions is a written response to a judgment creditor’s 
attempt to take some or all or your property to pay the judgment. 

The Writ of Execution deadline for a claim for exemptions is ten days.  If the judgment 
creditor obtains a writ of execution from the clerk of court, the claim for exemptions must be 
completed within ten days after service of the notice of levy on, you, the Judgment Debtor.  
(See Writ of Execution on Page 13 of 24 below.) 

The Garnishment deadline for a claim for exemptions is twenty days if non-wages are being 
garnished.  If the judgment creditor is garnishing non-wages, the claim for exemptions must be 
completed within twenty days of service of the Garnishee Summons upon you, the Judgment 
Debtor.  (See Garnishment on Page 18 of 24 below.) 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that can’t be used to satisfy a judgment. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have claim for exemptions forms.   

However, Legal Services of North Dakota provides two claims for exemption kits on their 
website.  (See Resources Available Through Legal Services of North Dakota on Page 3 of 24 
above.)  Since these aren’t ND Legal Self Help Center forms, the Center can’t provide support 
for the forms.

Overview: 

Garnishment is the withholding of your, Judgment Debtor’s, wages to pay a judgment or, it’s 
the withholding of property (non-wages) held by a third party, such as a bank account. 

If wages are being garnished, when you, the Judgment Debtor, receive a copy of the Garnishee 
Summons, you have 10 days to give a written verified list of dependents to your employer.  The 
amount garnished from wages is reduced by $20.00 for each dependent listed on the verified 
list of dependents. 

Laws and Rules:

Definitions section), NDCC Section 28-20.1-03 requires that ten days must have passed 
since filing the judgment before beginning any execution or other process to enforce the 
judgment.

 POST-JUDGMENT DISCOVERY TO IDENTIFY NON-EXEMPT ASSETS 

Overview: 

In aid of the judgment or execution of the judgment, the judgment creditor may obtain 
discovery from, you, the judgment debtor.  The judgment creditor can use post-judgment 
discovery to identify your non-exempt assets before applying for a writ of execution. 

Basic information about two common methods of discovery, interrogatories and production of 
documents, is available below. 

Laws and Rules: 

discovery. 

•  Rule 69(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure: Obtaining Discovery allows post-judgment 

•  Rules 26 through 37 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, also called the Discovery Rules, 

contain the requirements and process for discovery. 

o  Rule 33 of the Rules of Civil Procedure – Interrogatories, contains the 

requirements and process for requesting answer to written interrogatories. 
o  Rule 34 of the Rules of Civil Procedure – Production of Documents, contains the 

requirements and process for requesting production of documents. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that can’t be used to satisfy a judgment. 

Post-Judgment Discovery isn’t Filed with the Clerk of Court: 

Don’t file post-judgment discovery with the clerk of court unless: 

•  The discovery materials are being submitted to the court for disposition of a pending 

motion; 

•  The court orders the discovery material to be filed; or 
•  A judgment creditor, judgment debtor (you) or person affected by post-judgment 
discovery certifies that the filing is necessary for safekeeping of the documents or 
exhibits, in which event the judgment creditor, judgment debtor (you) or person 
affected by post-judgment discovery must state the reasons safekeeping is necessary.

interrogatories of any other party.  See Rule 33 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 

•  An interrogatory may relate to any matter that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b) of 

the Rules of Civil Procedure. 

•  There is a limit of no more than fifty (50) written interrogatories, including subparts. 
•  The interrogatories and answers/objections to the interrogatories must be served on

Objections to Interrogatories.  If you object to an interrogatory, you must write the specific 
grounds (reasons) for your objection.  Write your objection(s) concisely and in a non-
argumentative, non-confrontational manner.  The judgment creditor may challenge your 
objection(s). 

Examples of grounds (reasons) to object:

Irrelevant.  This objection states a specific fact or belief that this evidence has no 
bearing on the judgment collection issues. 

•  Overly Broad or Unduly Burdensome.  This objection states a specific fact or belief that 
this question lacks specificity as to time, place and/or subject matter being requested.  
However, over broad isn’t a valid objection unless you can show that the request 
imposes an undue burden. 

o  Be prepared to be specific and provide plenty of support for your objection. 

•  Asked and Answered.  This objection states a specific fact or belief that you’ve already 

been asked and answered the question in a previous interrogatory. 

•  Documents not Available or Answers not Available.  This objection states a specific fact 
or belief that the question seeks information and documents not reasonably available. 
•  Vague and Ambiguous.  This objection states a specific fact or belief that the question is 
vague, ambiguous, fails to identify the answer sought with sufficient particularity, and 
isn’t reasonably limited in time, nature or scope. 

If you don’t object in writing within the 30 day deadline, you can’t make the objection.

WRIT OF EXECUTION 

Overview: 

A writ of execution is a court order to a sheriff to seize your, the judgment debtor’s, non-
exempt property. 

There are two kinds of execution. 

•  The first kind of execution is against the property of the judgment debtor. 
•  The second kind of execution is to deliver possession of the property and any damages 

for keeping the property from the judgment creditor. 

If the judgment requires the sale of property, the judgment may be enforced by a special writ 
of execution.  The special writ of execution must direct that the property be sold and the 
proceeds from the sale are used to pay the judgment and the costs of having the sale. 

A judgment creditor can apply for a writ of execution at any time within ten years after the 
court ordered the judgment. 

•  The judgment creditor must apply for a writ of execution in the same county of the 

court that ordered the judgment.   

Generally, thirty days must have passed since the notice of entry of the judgment (or entry of a 
default judgment) before requesting a writ of execution.  Review the laws and rules related to 
the civil action for any exceptions to this general rule. 

In order to protect your exempt property, you, the judgment debtor, must make a claim for 
exemptions within ten days of notice of levy.  A claim for exemptions is a written response to 
the judgment creditor’s attempt to take all or part of your property to pay the judgment. 

Laws and Rules: 

•  Rule 62 of the Rules of Civil Procedure Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment. 
•  Rule 69(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-21 Execution of the Judgment, contains requirements and process for 

writs of execution. 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-25 Proceedings Supplementary to the Execution.  See Page 15 of 24

Process: 

The judgment creditor must apply for a writ of execution with the clerk of court of the North 
Dakota state district court or small claims court that ordered the judgment. 

The North Dakota state district court or small claims court that granted the judgment may issue 
a writ of execution to the sheriff of any county in North Dakota. 

•  More than one writ of execution may be issued at the same time to different sheriffs. 

The judgment creditor will also be required to prepare and file an Affidavit of Identification 
before the court will issue a writ of execution.  This is a document that identifies the name and 
address of the judgment debtor. 

If the court issues a writ of execution, the clerk of court will give or send the writ to the sheriff, 
depending on local procedures. 

Once the sheriff serves (gives) the writ of execution and notice of levy on you, the judgment 
debtor, you have ten days to file a claim for exemption.  (See the Resources Available from 
Legal Services of North Dakota section on Page 3 of 24 above.) 

•  Property that is protected is found in NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions.

PROCEEDINGS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE EXECUTION 

Overview: 

If an execution returns unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied, a judgment creditor can ask the court 
to order you, the judgment debtor, to appear and provide information about assets. 

If it appears to the court that you have property that you unjustly refuse to apply to the 
satisfaction of the execution, the court may require you to appear and answer concerning your 
property. 

The hearing will be held in the county where you reside, if you’re a resident of North Dakota.  
Otherwise, the hearing may be held where ordered by the court. 

Laws and Rules: 

Process: 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-25 Proceedings Supplementary to the Execution. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  Rule 3.2 of the Rules of Court Motions, contains process and requirements for making a 
motion (request) and answering a motion in an existing North Dakota state court case. 

The process to make a request to a North Dakota state court in an existing case is called a 
motion.   

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions available for making a motion 
or answering a motion for proceedings supplementary to the execution. 

The judgment creditor must serve and file a written motion to the court to make the request.  
For information about the requirements the judgment creditor must follow to make a motion, 
go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section and click on the 
“Making a Motion” link. 

To respond, or answer, the motion, general information about answering a motion is available 
at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section and click on the 
“Answering a Motion” link. 

First,  determine your deadline for answering the motion. 

If the motion was served by handing it to you, or by leaving it at your office or residence, you 
have fourteen days after service to serve and file your written answer to the motion. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 15 of 24 

Collect Judgment-Debtor/Rev Feb 2022 

If the motion was served by mailing it to you, or by third party commercial carrier, you have 
seventeen days from the postmarked date to serve and file your written answer to the motion. 

Second,  create your answer to motion documents. 

Generally, the following documents must be created, served and filed to answer a motion. 

•  Answer Brief in support of the answer to motion; 

o  A required written document that explains why your argument should win.  A 

brief takes the relevant laws or rules and applies them to the facts of a particular 
situation. 

•  Your affidavit or declaration to support the answer to motion; 

o  A written statement of the facts, about which you have first-hand knowledge.   

•  Other supporting documents (other affidavits, exhibits, etc.); and 
•  Confidential Information Form 

(ndcourts.gov/Media/Default/Legal%20Resources/rules/ndrct/Appendix-H.pdf). 

Remember, make copies of all of your documents for your records. 

Third,  serve copies of your answer to motion documents on the judgment creditor.  File the 

originals with the clerk of court. 

Copies of the answer to motion documents must be served on the judgment creditor as 
required by Rule 5 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Service information and resources are available at the ND Legal Self Help Center website: 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section and click on the “Service 
Instructions and Forms” link.  See the “Service After a District Court Civil Action Has Started” 
section. 

The original answer to motion documents and the documents showing proof of service must be 
filed with the clerk of court.   

Fourth,  if a hearing is scheduled, attend the hearing. 

The hearing will be held in the county where you reside, if you’re a resident of North Dakota.  
Otherwise, the hearing may be held where ordered by the court.

JUDGMENT LIEN AGAINST REAL PROPERTY (REAL ESTATE) 

Overview: 

The judgment acts as a lien against the non-exempt real property (real estate) located in the 
county where the judgment is docketed.  The lien lasts for ten years from the original docketing 
of the judgment. 

The ten year lien timeframe also applies to non-exempt real property (real estate) you acquire 
after the docketing of the original judgment. 

•  The homestead is exempt property.  The judgment lien doesn’t apply to the homestead. 

This isn’t a direct collection of money.  However, the judgment lien prevents you from selling or 
mortgaging the real property (real estate) until the judgment is paid or expires. 

If non-exempt real property (real estate) is located in a different North Dakota county than the 
county where the judgment was granted, the judgment creditor may make a written request to 
the clerk of court of the county that granted the judgment. 

After receiving the written request and the fee to transcribe the judgment, the clerk of court of 
can transcribe the judgment to other North Dakota county clerks of court. 

Laws and Rules: 

•  Rule 58 of the Rules of Civil Procedure Entry and Notice of Entry of Judgment. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-20 Judgments.  See specifically: 

o  Section 28-20-13: Docketing judgment - Transcript to other counties - Lien on 

real property. 

o  Section 28-20-16: How judgment docketed. 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  NDCC Chapter 47-18 Homestead, contains the definition of homestead and 

requirements related to the homestead. 

Process: 

First,  the judgment creditor must file an affidavit of identification of the judgment debtor (you) 

with the clerk of court of the North Dakota county where the real property (real estate) is 
located.  This is a document that identifies your name and address. 

Second,  the clerk of court dockets the judgment.

GARNISHMENT 

Overview: 

Garnishment is the act of taking the judgment debtor’s money from a third party to satisfy a 
judgment.  For example, taking the judgment debtor’s wages from their employer, or the 
judgment debtor’s money from their bank. 

After the court orders a judgment, the judgment creditor can issue a summons against any 
person, any public corporation, the United States, the State of North Dakota or any institution, 
department, or agency of the state, indebted to or having any property in possession or under 
control, which belongs to the judgment debtor. 

Please note that the person who has control of the judgment debtor’s property, i.e. wages, is 
called the Garnishee.  For example, a judgment debtor’s employer is the Garnishee. 

Garnishment is the only way to require an employer to withhold a portion of the judgment 
debtor’s wages for payment of the judgment. 

Laws and Rules: 

•  Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure Persons Subject to Jurisdiction; Process; Service. 
•  Rule 69(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-21 Execution of the Judgment, contains requirements and process for 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  NDCC Chapter 32-09.1 Garnishment, contains requirements and process for 

writs of execution. 

garnishment. 

o  The ND State Legislature included statutory forms within NDCC Chapter 32-09.1 
for many of the required garnishment legal documents.  The statutory forms 
provide suggested language and formatting. 

No Garnishment Forms Through ND Legal Self Help Center: 

Forms for garnishment aren’t available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  Refer to the 
statutory forms within NDCC Chapter 32-09.1.

Process: 

First,  the judgment creditor must serve (give) you the following: 

1.  Notice that a garnishee summons will be served; and 
2.  A garnishment debtor’s list.   

NDCC Section 32-09.1-04 includes a statutory form for the notice and the garnishment debtor’s 
list. 

The notice must be served on you at least ten days before the garnishee summons is served. 

Service information and resources are available at the ND Legal Self Help Center website: 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section. 

•  Service of the notice on you must be in person or by first-class mail.  If the notice isn’t 

served correctly, the garnishment is void. 

o  The requirements for personal service are found in Rule 4(d) of the Rules of Civil 

Procedure. 

The judgment creditor must wait at least ten days before moving to the next step. 

Second,  ten days after the notice of the garnishee summons and garnishment debtor’s list 

have been served on you, the judgment creditor must: 

Serve the following on the garnishee: 

1.  Garnishee Summons; 
2.  Notice to Defendant; 
3.  A blank Garnishment Disclosure form; and 
4.  Include a $25 payment, payable to the garnishee, as the fee for completing the 

Garnishment Disclosure form. 

The judgment creditor must also serve the following on you: 

1.  Garnishee Summons; and 
2.  Notice to Defendant. 

NDCC Section 32-09.1-07 includes a suggested form for the Garnishee Summons and Notice to 
Defendant. 

NDCC Section 32-09.1-09 includes a suggested form for the Garnishee Disclosure.   

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 19 of 24 

Collect Judgment-Debtor/Rev Feb 2022 

Service on both you and the garnishee must be by personal service.   

•  The requirements for personal service are found in Rule 4(d) of the Rules of Civil 

Procedure. 

When you receive a copy of the Garnishee Summons, if wages will be garnished, you have ten 
days to give a written, verified list of dependents to your employer.  (See the Resources 
Available from Legal Services of North Dakota section on Page 3 of 24 above.) 

If non-wages will be garnished, you have twenty days to make a claims for exemptions.  (See 
the Resources Available from Legal Services of North Dakota section on Page 3 of 24 above.) 

Third,  within twenty days of service of the Garnishee Summons and Notice to Defendant, the 

garnishee must serve the judgment creditor with a completed Garnishment Disclosure form. 

Fourth,  the garnishee holds the garnished earnings, until: 

•  The judgment creditor serves a writ of execution on the garnishee; or  
•  You authorize the release of the garnished earnings to the judgment creditor. 

This must occur no earlier than twenty days and no later than three hundred and sixty days 
from service of the garnishee summons.  The judgment creditor and you may agree in writing to 
a longer period of time. 

NDCC Chapter 28-21 includes writ of execution requirements.   

NDCC Section 32-09.1-20 includes termination of garnishment requirements. 

The judgment creditor is required to serve the writ of execution on the garnishee.

Overview: 

In general, a North Dakota small claims or state district court judgment expires ten years from

judgment debtor thereon; 

•  The exact amount due upon said judgment, after allowing all offsets and counterclaims 

known to the affiant; 

•  Any other facts or circumstances necessary to a complete disclosure as to the exact 

condition of said judgment; and 

•  A verification statement that the content of the affidavit is true and isn’t based on 

information or belief.

owes the judgment, also called the judgment debtor: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

Judgment Debtor’s name; 
Judgment Debtor’s address;
