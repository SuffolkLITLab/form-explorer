An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves 
in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. The information provided in this informational 
guide isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. If you’re unsure if this information 
is right for you, consult a lawyer.  

•  For more information about finding a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-

lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law. This covers basic information about the 
process of petitioning a North Dakota State District Court to enforce an out-of-state court or tribal 
court custody or visitation order. This information doesn’t include the process of asking the Court 
for a warrant to take physical custody of the child(ren) before the required hearing. The Center isn’t 
responsible for any consequences that may result from the information provided. The information 
can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state of North Dakota. 

Use at your own risk. 

IMPORTANT! If you want a North Dakota state district court to MODIFY or AMEND your out-
of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order, you CAN’T use this enforcement 
process. Consult a lawyer for assistance.

What is Expedited Enforcement of an Out-of-State Court or Tribal 
Court Custody or Visitation Order? 

An out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order is a judgment, decree, or other 
order issued by a court of another state or tribe that governs the legal custody, physical 
custody, or visitation of a minor child or minor children. (A minor child is less than 18 years old.) 

The order may be a permanent, temporary, initial, or modification order. 

Expedited enforcement is a sped-up court process that allows a North Dakota state judge or 
judicial referee to enforce the physical custody part of an out-of-state court or tribal court 
order. The child(ren) must be, or must likely be, physically located in North Dakota. 

You may make a written request to a North Dakota state district court for expedited, or sped-
up, enforcement of the physical custody part of the order if: 

1.  You’re granted legal custody, physical custody, or visitation in the order; 
2.  You’re entitled to immediate physical custody of the child(ren) in the order; 
3.  The child(ren) are currently in North Dakota (or you strongly believe they are); and 
4.  The person who currently has physical custody won’t allow you to take custody of the 

child(ren). 

(Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)) 

Does Expedited Enforcement Transfer the Entire Out-of-State Court or 
Tribal Court Case to North Dakota? 

No. Expedited enforcement doesn’t transfer the entire case to North Dakota. The entire case 
stays with the out-of-state court or tribal court until the out-of-state court or tribal court says 
they’ll give up their jurisdiction over the case, and a North Dakota state district court says 
they’ll take over jurisdiction. 

Jurisdiction is the power of a court to inquire about the facts, apply the law, and make 
judgments. Jurisdiction also gives a court the power to modify or amend their judgments. 

In cases involving custody or visitation of minor children, jurisdiction doesn’t change from one 
state court to a different state court, or from tribal court to state court unless requirements 
related to the child and the child’s parents or guardians are met. (See the UCCJEA.) 

Consult a lawyer for assistance with this complex court process.

Overview of the Three (3) Step Expedited Enforcement Process 

If you have legal custody, physical custody, or visitation in an out-of-state court or tribal court 
order, you may ask a North Dakota state district court to quickly enforce the order in North 
Dakota if the order allows you to take immediate physical custody of the minor child. 

IMPORTANT! Steps One (1) and Two (2) may be combined into one step when you need to 
petition a North Dakota state district court for expedited enforcement, but you haven’t 
registered the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

Step One (1): 
Registration 

Registration allows the North Dakota state district court to 1) recognize your 
out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order exists, 2) that the 
order is in effect, and 3) the order is the most current version. 

For information about the registration step, see the “Registering an Out-of-
State Court or Tribal Court Custody or Visitation Order.” Informational Guide. 

Step Two (2): 
Petition for 
Expedited 
Enforcement 

You file a written petition for expedited enforcement that 1) shows you meet 
the requirements for expedited enforcement, and 2) requests that a North 
Dakota state district court enforce the physical custody terms of your out-of-
state court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

Step Three (3): 
Attend the 
Required 
Hearing 

A hearing on the petition for expedited enforcement is required on the next 
business day after service of the order requiring the other party to appear, 
unless that date is impossible. Then, on the first business day possible. 

The person who has physical custody the child(ren) may be required to bring 
the child(ren) to the hearing. If you prove that the custody or visitation order 
entitles you to immediate physical custody of the child(ren), the judge or 
judicial referee may allow you to take physical custody after the hearing. 

IMPORTANT! This Informational Guide doesn’t include the steps for asking the Court for a 
warrant to take physical custody of the child(ren) BEFORE the required hearing is held. If you 
show in your written application and testimony for the warrant that the child is immediately 
likely to suffer serious physical harm, and/or the child is immediately likely to be removed from 
North Dakota, the judge or judicial referee may issue the warrant. 

If you want to request a warrant, see the “Enforcing an Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court 
Custody or Visitation Order – with a Warrant Requested” Informational Guide.

SECTION ONE (1): Basic Steps to Petition for Expedited Enforcement of 
Your Order, if You’re NOT Applying for a Warrant for Immediate 
Physical Custody Before the Required Hearing is Held 

Types of Cases Whose Custody or Visitation Orders May be Registered and 
Enforced 

The following types of cases, also called child custody proceedings, which result in an out-of-
state court or tribal court custody or visitation judgment, decree, or other order, may be 
registered and enforced using the process in this Informational Guide: 

•  Abuse; 
•  Dependency; 
•  Divorce; 
•  Guardianship;

custody, or visitation. 

Types of Cases Whose Custody or Visitation Orders Can’t be Registered and 
Enforced

Courts Whose Custody or Visitation Orders May be Registered and Enforced 

Custody orders issued by a court of the following may be registered & enforced: 

•  A state of the United States; 
•  The District of Columbia; 
•  Puerto Rico; 
•  United States Virgin Islands; 
•  Any territory or insular possession of the United States; 
•  An Indian tribe or band, or Alaskan native village, which is recognized by federal law or 

formally acknowledged by a state of the United States; and 

•  A foreign country, if certain requirements are met. 

Step One (1): 

 

Register the Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court 
Custody or Visitation Order You Want Enforced. 

Registration allows the North Dakota state district court to: 

1)  Recognize your out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order exists; 
2)  Recognize the order is currently in effect; and 
3)  Recognize the order is the most current version. 

A person (Respondent) awarded legal custody, physical custody, or visitation in the order is 
allowed to challenge the registration for any of the following limited reasons: 

1)  The court that issued (signed) the order didn’t have jurisdiction (authority) to issue the 

2)  The order has been vacated (cancelled), stayed (put on hold), or modified (updated); or 
3)  The person challenging registration didn’t get the required notice of the court case that 

order; 

resulted in the order.

  Go to Step Two (2) if You Already Registered the Order in North Dakota 

Skip Step One and go directly to Step Two if you’ve already registered the out-of-state or tribal 
court custody or visitation order you want enforced. 

If you’ve already registered the order with a North Dakota state district court, you’ll have a 
signed and dated order with the words “North Dakota,” “District Court,” and a North Dakota 
county name listed on the top of the first page. You’ll also see a case number listed. 

The name of the order will be on the first page and include words like “order confirming 
registration.” 

  Go to Step Two (2) if You Don’t Have Time to Register the Order Separately 

Skip Step One and go directly to Step Two if you haven’t registered the out-of-state or tribal 
court custody or visitation order you want enforced, but you don’t think you have time to 
register the order first. 

The registration process, on its own, can take 3 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer. People tend to 
use the stand-alone registration process when they’re not experiencing an urgent situation 
related to getting physical custody of their child(ren) who are currently located in North Dakota. 

If you’re experiencing an urgent situation where you need a North Dakota state district court to 
enforce the physical custody part of your order, you’re allowed to combine registration with 
your request for expedited enforcement. The judge or judicial referee assigned to your 
expedited enforcement request can make a decision without waiting the 3 to 4 weeks required 
with the stand-alone registration process.  

  Complete the Process to Register the Order 

If you decide to use the stand-alone registration process to register the out-of-state or tribal 
court custody or visitation order you want enforced, use the Registering an Out-of-State Court 
or Tribal Court Custody or Visitation Order Informational Guide to register your order. 

The registration process, on its own, can take 3 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer. People tend to 
use the stand-alone registration process when they’re not experiencing an urgent situation 
related to getting physical custody of their child(ren) who are currently located in North Dakota.

•  Create Your Expedited Enforcement Documents; 

Step Two (2): 

 

and 

•  File the Documents with the Clerk of District Court. 

  1st 

Get Copies of the Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court Order You Want a 
North Dakota State District Court to Enforce 

  

A North Dakota state district court judge or judicial referee can’t enforce your out-of-state 
court or tribal court order unless you give them a copy. 

Contact the out-of-state court or tribal court that issued the custody or visitation judgment, 
decree, or other order and get copies. 

The number of copies and the type of copies you need depend on whether you’ve already 
registered the judgment, decree, or other order with a North Dakota state district court.  

• 

• 

If your order is already registered you need: 

o  ONE certified copy of the order, OR one copy of a certified copy. 

If your order ISN’T already registered you need: 

o  TWO copies of the order.  ONE MUST be a certified copy. 
o 

(A copy of a certified copy won’t be accepted.) 

  2nd   Create Your Verified Petition 

Two verified petition forms are available in Section Two of this Informational Guide. 

You, the person requesting expedited enforcement, are the Petitioner. 

The Respondent is the person who: 

1)  Currently has physical custody of the child(ren) in North Dakota; and 
2)  Is awarded legal custody, physical custody, or visitation in the out-of-state court or 

tribal court order you want a North Dakota state district court to enforce. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 9 of 17 

Enforce Foreign Custody Order/Rev Jul 2022 

If you already registered your out-of-state court or tribal court order, see the first verified 
petition form in Section Two.  The name of the form is “Petition for Expedited Enforcement of 
an Out-of-State or Tribal Court Custody Determination (N.D.C.C. § 14-14.1-28).” 

•  Use your North Dakota state district court order confirming registration of your out-of-

state or tribal court order to fill in the top of the verified petition form. 

o  Fill in the same North Dakota county name and case number from the order 

o 

confirming registration. 
If a Judicial District name is listed on the order confirming registration, fill in the 
name. Otherwise, you may leave it blank.  

If you HAVEN’T already registered your out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation 
order, see the second verified petition form in Section Two.  The name of the form is “Petition 
for Registration & Expedited Enforcement of an Out-of-State or Tribal Court Custody 
Determination (N.D.C.C. § 14-14.1-28).” 

•  Leave the case number blank.  A North Dakota state district court case number is 

assigned by the clerk of court if your documents are accepted for filing. 

If neither petition form in this guide is right for your circumstances, you’ll need to create your 
own petition document, or retain a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota to create the 
petition document for you. 

  3rd   Create the Confidential Information Form (CIF) 

The Confidential Information form lists the full confidential information that isn’t allowed to 
appear in other documents filed with a North Dakota state district court.  This form is a part of 
the court record that isn’t seen by the public. 

Since petitions for expedited enforcement include references to confidential information, you 
must complete a Confidential Information Form (CIF). The form must contain the full 
confidential information you reference in your petition. 

You’re the only person responsible for making sure confidential information doesn’t appear in 
the petition you prepare. 

Confidential information includes: 

•  Full name of minor child 
•  Full birthdates 
•  Social security numbers 

•  Taxpayer identification numbers 
•  Financial-account numbers 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 10 of 17 

Enforce Foreign Custody Order/Rev Jul 2022 

Documents filed with the Court with references to confidential information must include only:  

•  The initials of the minor child 
•  The year of birth 
•  The last four (4) digits of the social security number and taxpayer identification number 
•  The last four (4) digits of the financial-account number 

A Confidential Information Form is available as the third form in Section Two (2) of this 
Informational Guide. 

  4th    Create Proposed Orders, if the District Court Requires Proposed Orders 

A proposed order is a document you create for the judge or judicial referee to sign.  If the judge 
or judicial referee reviews your proposed order and agrees with what you wrote, they date and 
sign the proposed order and it becomes an official order of the court. 

Contact the North Dakota state district court where you’ll file your petition documents.  Ask if 
you’re required to file any of the proposed orders listed below when you file your petition. 

You may be required to create the following proposed orders: 

•  Proposed order to appear at the hearing on the petition for expedited enforcement; 

and/or 

•  Proposed order after hearing on the petition for expedited enforcement. 

A form for a proposed order to appear at the hearing on the petition is available as the fourth 
form in Section Two of this Informational Guide. 

A formatting example of a proposed order after the hearing on the petition is available as the 
fifth document in Section Two of this Informational Guide. The formatting example isn’t a 
form. You’ll be required to create your own document, but may use the example as a guide. 

  5th    Make Copies of Your Expedited Enforcement Documents 

Make copies of all of your completed expedited enforcement documents. You’ll need copies to 
bring with you to the required hearing. 

If you don’t make copies of your documents, after you file your documents with the clerk of 
court, you can request copies.  You’ll be charged for each page of each document the clerk of 
court copies for you.

Enforce Foreign Custody Order/Rev Jul 2022 

  6th    File the Originals of Your Expedited Enforcement Documents 

Decide the venue (North Dakota county) to file your expedited enforcement documents. 

If you already registered the order, file in the same North Dakota state district court where you 
registered the order. Use the same case number. 

If you HAVEN’T already registered the order, you need to decide the venue, or North Dakota 
county, of the North Dakota state district court to file your expedited enforcement documents. 
Locations of each North Dakota state district court by county are available at 
ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

North Dakota’s Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) doesn’t say 
how you decide the venue for registration or for expedited enforcement. Review Chapter 28-04 
of the North Dakota Century Code to decide where to file. You may need to consult a lawyer for 
help. 

File the following documents with the Clerk of District Court: 

• 

If you already registered the custody or visitation order in a North Dakota state district 
court: 

o  Your original, completed verified petition for expedited enforcement; 
o  Your original, completed Confidential Information Form; 
o  A certified copy, or a copy of a certified copy, of the registered out-of-state court 
or tribal court custody or visitation order that you want the North Dakota state 
district court to enforce; 
If required, your original, completed proposed order to appear at the hearing on 
the petition for expedited enforcement; and 
If required, your original, completed proposed order after hearing on the 
petition for expedited enforcement. 

o 

o 

• 

If you HAVEN’T registered the custody order in a North Dakota state district court (list 
continues on next page): 

o  Your original, completed verified petition for registration and expedited 

enforcement; 

o  Your original, completed Confidential Information Form; 
o  Two copies of the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order 

that you want the North Dakota state district court to enforce; 

  One copy MUST be a certified copy of the order. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 12 of 17

o If required, your original, completed proposed order to appear at the hearing on

the petition for expedited enforcement; and

o If required, your original, completed proposed order after hearing on the

petition for expedited enforcement.

If the Clerk of District Court accepts your expedited enforcement documents for filing, you 
may be required to pay a $10.00 filing fee. 

If you already registered the custody order, you won’t be charged a filing fee. 

If you HAVEN’T registered the custody order, you’ll be charged a $10.00 registration filing fee. 

If you’re required to pay the $10.00 filing fee and can’t afford to pay, complete the Filing Fee 
Waiver Request – District Court/Small Claims Court form set at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/fee-waiver. File the form set when you file your expedited enforcement documents. 

 7th 

Arrange to have the Order to Appear at the Hearing Served on the 
Respondent(s) 

After your expedited enforcement documents are accepted for filing, the judge or judicial 
referee assigned to your case decides whether to issue (sign) an order for the Respondent to 
appear at a hearing on the petition. 

The hearing is when both you and the Respondent have your chance to explain your sides. 

If the judge or judicial referee allows a hearing to be scheduled and issues (signs) an order for 
the Respondent to appear at the hearing, you MUST arrange for the following documents: 

• A copy of the signed Order to Appear at the hearing on the petition; and
• A copy of your Petition for Expedited Enforcement (or Petition for Registration 

and Expedited Enforcement)

To be served (given) to the following people: 

The Respondent; and

•
• Any other person who has physical custody of the child(ren).

Service instructions and forms are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-
action in the “Service to Start a District Court Civil Action” section.

Enforce Foreign Custody Order/Rev Jul 2022 

IMPORTANT! You can’t serve the documents yourself unless the people you serve agree in 
writing. Someone who is 18 years old or older and not a party or interested in the case serves 
the documents. 

The judge or judicial referee assigned to the case won’t hold the hearing unless you file proof 
of service with the court. 

Proof of service tells the District Court when, how, and where the Respondent and any person 
who has physical custody of the child(ren) were served copies of the above documents. 

•  A certificate of service gives the court proof of service when a sheriff or other officer 

served the documents. 

•  An affidavit of service or a declaration of service gives the court proof of service when a 

person other than a sheriff or other officer served the documents. 

•  An admission of service gives the court proof of service when the Respondent or other 
person with physical custody of the child(ren) agree in writing that you can serve them. 

Step Three (3): 

 

Attend the Hearing on the Petition for Expedited 
Enforcement of Your Out-of-State Court or Tribal 
Court Custody or Visitation Order. 

The Hearing on the Petition Happens Very Quickly. 

The hearing on the petition for expedited enforcement of an out-of-state court or tribal court 
custody order must happen: 

•  On the next business day after service of the order requiring the other party to appear. 
• 
If the next business day after service is impossible, then, on the first business day 
possible.

What Happens if You, the Petitioner, Prove Your Side?  

You’re required to prove that the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order 
entitles you to immediate physical custody of the child(ren). 

If the judge or judicial referee assigned to the case finds that you, the Petitioner, proved 
you’re entitled to immediate physical custody: 

•  The judge or judicial referee MUST order that you may take immediate physical custody 

of the child(ren). 

•  The judge or judicial referee MUST also order that the Respondent pay you the 

necessary and reasonable expenses you incurred because you brought the petition to 
the court. 

o  This includes costs, communication expenses, lawyer’s fees, investigative fees, 
expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child care costs during the course 
of the expedited enforcement case. 

•  HOWEVER, if the Respondent proves that payment of the expenses would be clearly 

inappropriate, the Judicial Officer may reduce the amount the Respondent is ordered to 
pay. 

What Does the Respondent Need to Prove for You, the Petitioner, to Lose?  

At the hearing, if the Respondent proves the following, the judge or judicial referee ISN’T 
REQUIRED to order that you can take immediate physical custody of the child(ren): 

•  The out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order HASN’T been registered 
AND confirmed by the North Dakota state district court AND (list continues on next 
page): 

o  The out-of-state court or tribal court that issued (signed) the custody or 

visitation order DIDN’T have jurisdiction (authority) to issue the order under 
Sections 14-14.1-12 through 14-14.1-21 of the North Dakota Century Code; 

o  The out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order you, the 

Petitioner, seek to enforce has been vacated (cancelled), stayed (put on hold), or 
modified (updated) by the court of a state or tribe having jurisdiction to do so 
under Sections 14-14.1-12 through 14-14.1-21 of the North Dakota Century 
Code; AND/OR 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 15 of 17 

Enforce Foreign Custody Order/Rev Jul 2022 

o  The Respondent was entitled to notice of the case that resulted in the out-of-

state court or tribal court that issued the custody or visitation order, but didn’t 
get the required notice. The notice requirements are in Section 14-14.1-07 of the 
North Dakota Century Code.  

OR 

•  The out-of-state court or tribal court custody order the Petitioner seeks to enforce HAS 
BEEN registered AND confirmed by the North Dakota state district court, BUT the order 
has been vacated (cancelled), stayed (put on hold), or modified (updated) by the court 
of a state or tribe having jurisdiction to do so under Sections 14-14.1-12 through 14-
14.1-21 of the North Dakota Century Code. 

IMPORTANT! If the judge or judicial referee decides that you, the Petitioner, lost and the 
Respondent won, the judge or judicial referee MUST order that you, the Petitioner, pay the 
Respondent their necessary and reasonable expenses that they incurred because you brought 
the petition to the court. This includes costs, communication expenses, lawyer’s fees, 
investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child care costs during the 
course of the expedited enforcement case. 

HOWEVER, if you prove that payment of the expenses would be clearly inappropriate, the 
judge or judicial referee may reduce the amount they order you to pay to the Respondent.
