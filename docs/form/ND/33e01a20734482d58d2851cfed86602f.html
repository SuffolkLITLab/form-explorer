information is intended as a starting point for your research into contempt of court in North 
Dakota state district courts.  This information isn’t intended for legal advice and can’t replace 
the advice of competent legal counsel licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed.

NO CONTEMPT OF COURT FORMS AVAILABLE 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center and the North Dakota Court System don’t have forms 
or instructions available specifically for asking a North Dakota state court to find a party in a 
civil case in contempt of court. 

If you represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer 
to do so. 

The basic steps in the motion process to ask a North Dakota state district court to find a party in 
a civil case in contempt of court start on Page 7.  The steps include the names and general 
descriptions of many of the legal documents you’ll need to create and prepare. 

If you’re interested in finding an attorney to represent you, go to Page 15 for all of the 
attorney resources available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.

OVERVIEW OF CONTEMPT OF COURT 

What is contempt of court? 

In general, contempt of court is disobedience of a court order.  Section 27-10-01.1(a) of the 
North Dakota Century Code defines contempt of court as: 

1.  Intentional misconduct in the presence of the court which interferes with the court 

proceeding or with the administration of justice, or which impairs the respect due the 
court; 

2.  Intentional nonpayment of a sum of money ordered by the court to be paid in a case 

when by law execution cannot be awarded for the collection of the sum; 

3.  Intentional disobedience, resistance, or obstruction of the authority, process, or order 

of a court or other officer, including a judicial referee or magistrate; 

4.  Intentional refusal of a witness to appear for examination, to be sworn or to affirm, or 

to testify after being ordered to do so by the court; 

5.  Intentional refusal to produce a record, document, or other object after being ordered 

to do so by the court; 

6.  Intentional behavior in derogation of any provision of a summons issued pursuant to 

Rule 8.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court; or 

7.  Any other act or omission specified in the court rules or by law as a ground for contempt 

of court. 

Does contempt of court need to happen in front of a judge or judicial referee? 

No.  Behavior that’s considered contempt of court can happen in or out of court. 

If the judge or judicial referee didn’t see the behavior that the moving party feels is in contempt 
of an order (the action did NOT happen in their presence), the moving party MUST bring a 
written motion, or application, explaining why they feel the opposing party should be held in 
contempt by the court.  (See Page 7.) 

What does the party requesting a contempt of court sanction need to prove? 

The party in a civil case who wants a judge or judicial referee to find another party in contempt 
of court must prove two things: 

•  That the other party clearly committed contempt of court; and 
•  That the other party had a willful and inexcusable intent to commit contempt of court. 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 2 of 18 

Contempt of Court/Rev May 2020 

How is contempt of court punished? 

Contempt of court may be punished by remedial or punitive sanctions. 

In civil cases, contempt of court is punished with remedial sanctions. 

A court can only punish with punitive sanctions when a complaint charging a party with 
contempt of court is issued by: 

1.  The state’s attorney of a county; 
2.  The attorney general; or 
3.  A special prosecutor appointed by the court. 

What are remedial sanctions for contempt of court? 

A North Dakota state district court may order one or more of the following remedial sanctions: 

•  Payment of a sum of money sufficient to compensate a party, other than the court, for a 
loss or injury suffered as a result of the contempt, including an amount to reimburse the 
party for costs and expenses incurred as a result of the contempt. 

•  A forfeiture not to exceed two thousand dollars for each day the contempt continues. 

•  An order designed to ensure compliance with a previous order of the court. 

• 

Imprisonment if the contempt of court is: 

o 

o 

o 

o 

o 

Intentional nonpayment of a sum of money ordered by the court to be paid in a 
case when by law execution cannot be awarded for the collection of the sum; 
Intentional disobedience, resistance, or obstruction of the authority, process, or 
order of a court or other officer, including a referee or magistrate; 
Intentional refusal of a witness to appear for examination, to be sworn or to 
affirm, or to testify after being ordered to do so by the court; 
Intentional refusal to produce a record, document, or other object after being 
ordered to do so by the court; or 
Intentional behavior in derogation of any provision of a summons issued 
pursuant to rule 8.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court; 

The imprisonment may extend for as long as the contemnor continues the contempt or 
six months, whichever is shorter. 

•  A sanction other than the sanctions listed above if the court expressly finds that those 

sanctions would be ineffectual to terminate a continuing contempt. 

 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 3 of 18 

Contempt of Court/Rev May 2020 

What are punitive sanctions for contempt of court? 

Punitive sanctions include a sanction of imprisonment if the sentence is for a definite period of 
time.  A sanction requiring payment of a sum of money is punitive if the sanction is not 
conditioned upon performance or nonperformance of an act, and if the sanction's purpose is to 
uphold the authority of the court. 

A court can only punish with punitive sanctions when a complaint charging a party with 
contempt of court is issued by: 

1.  The state’s attorney of a county; 
2.  The attorney general; or 
3.  A special prosecutor appointed by the court. 

What is the process for asking a North Dakota state district court to find that the other party 
is in contempt of court? 

If the behavior happens outside of the immediate view or presence of the court, the party in 
the case who wants a judge or judicial referee to find the other party in contempt makes a 
written motion, or application, for the court to issue an order to show cause. 

The party making the motion tells the court, in writing, about the specific behavior they believe 
constitutes contempt of the court’s order or judgment.  The written motion includes a request 
for the court to issue an order to show cause. 

If the written motion includes sufficient facts and support, the court will issue an order to show 
cause with a hearing date, time and location.  If the written motion doesn’t include sufficient 
facts and support, the court will dismiss the motion and no hearing will be held. 

The order to show cause requires the other party to appear at a hearing and prove to the court 
why they shouldn’t be held in contempt of court for the behavior. 

At the hearing, both parties will have the opportunity to tell their side of the events.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 

(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to contempt of court is to use the print version of the 
North Dakota Century Code to locate the short summaries of case law after each Section.  Case 
law summaries directly follow the text of the Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the 
opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court Opinions” link and enter the 
case name or case citation.

BASIC COURT PROCESS FOR MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE 

CAUTION !! 

Individual Courts May Have a Differently Ordered Process 
AND/OR Additional Requirements to the Basic Process!! 

The Motion for an Order to Show Cause process is complicated and highly dependent on the 
specific circumstances of the alleged contempt of the court order.  The information that 
follows is the basic court process for a Motion for an Order to Show Cause.   

HOWEVER, there are many possible variations to the basic process. 

Individual state district courts may require the moving party to follow a differently ordered 
process than the basic process that follows.  Individual state district courts may have 
additional requirements to those that follow. 

If you feel you need assistance, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who can 
agree to represent you. 

PARTIES IN A MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE:  

Plaintiff: The party (or parties) listed as the Plaintiff in the original civil action. 

Defendant: The party (or parties) listed as the Defendant in the original civil action. 

Moving party: The party bringing the motion for an order to show cause, in other words, the 
party who completes and signs the Motion, Brief in Support of Motion, and Affidavit in Support 
of Motion. The moving party in a motion may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. 

Opposing party: (Also called the Non-moving party.)  The other party (or other parties).  In 
other words, the party or parties who did not bring the motion. 

STEP ONE:  THE MOVING PARTY CREATES THE DOCUMENTS FOR A MOTION FOR AN ORDER  

TO SHOW CAUSE  

For general information about the motion process in North Dakota civil court actions, Go to 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section.

Contempt of Court/Rev May 2020 

Generally, to start a motion for an order to show cause, the moving party files the following 
documents with the North Dakota state court that granted the judgment or order the moving 
party wants enforced. 

•  Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 

o  A short, written statement that tells the court and all parties what the moving 

party is requesting from the court. 
•  Brief in Support of Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 

o  A written document that explains why the party filing the motion should have 
the motion for an order to show cause granted.  A brief takes the relevant laws 
or rules and applies them to the facts of a particular situation. 

•  Moving party’s Affidavit in Support of Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 

o  A written statement of fact about which the moving party has first-hand 

knowledge.  Facts referred to in the brief must also appear in the affidavit. 

•  Other supporting documents (other affidavits, exhibits, etc.);  
•  Proposed Order to Show Cause; and 

o  A proposed order prepared by the moving party for the judge or judicial referee 
to date and sign if the moving party’s motion is approved to move forward to a 
hearing. 

•  Confidential Information Form 

(www.ndcourts.gov/Media/Default/Legal%20Resources/rules/ndrct/Appendix-H.pdf). 

The case number will be the case number of the judgment/order.   

The following General-Use forms are available on the “Making a Motion” webpage.  (See link 
above.)   

The moving party may find the General-Use motion forms useful as a starting point for creating 
their own motion documents.  

•  Motion form; 
•  Brief in Support of Motion form; 
•  Affidavit form; 
•  Caption and Signature form. 

Examples of documents can be found in the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual 
here: www.legalassist.org/?id=128&page=ND+Family+Law+Manual.  The Family Law Manual 
was created for lawyers in divorce cases.

**An example of a motion for an order to show cause that was filed in a North Dakota state 
district court civil case is found at the end of this research guide.  The moving party may find it 
of interest as a formatting example. 

(The reference to the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual and the attached 
example of a motion are included for your convenience only.  Including the reference to the 
Family Law Manual and motion example does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, 
warrants, or accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the Family Law Manual or the 
motion example.  Use at your own risk.) 

STEP TWO:   THE MOVING PARTY FILES THE MOTION FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE  

DOCUMENTS WITH THE CLERK OF COURT   

The original of each of the moving party’s motion documents must be filed with the clerk of 
court in the case for which the moving party is asking for an order to show cause. 

•  Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 
•  Brief in Support of Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 
•  Other supporting documents; 
•  Proposed Order to Show Cause; 
•  Confidential Information Form. 

If the moving party lives out of the area, or is unable to take the motion documents to the clerk 
of court office for filing, the moving party may contact the clerk of court for information on how 
the clerk’s office will accept the documents for filing and payment of the filing fee. 

Contact information for clerks of district court by county is available online at 
www.ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

The moving party may be required to pay a filing fee.  Confirm the amount, if any, with the 
clerk of court. 

The Filing Fee Waiver Request – District Court/Small Claims Court form set is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver.  The completed fee waiver request forms are 
filed at the same time as the motion.

STEP THREE:  THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL REFEREE ASSIGNED TO THE CASE REVIEWS THE  

MOTION DOCUMENTS   

The judge or judicial referee assigned to the case reviews the motion documents filed by the 
moving party. 

If the judge or judicial referee decides the moving party’s written motion documents contain 
sufficient facts and support to move forward to a hearing, the judge or judicial referee will issue 
an order to show cause with a date, time and location of the hearing. 

If the moving party’s written motion documents don’t contain sufficient facts and support to 
move forward, the judge or judicial referee will dismiss the moving party’s motion and no 
hearing will be scheduled or held on the moving party’s motion. 

STEP FOUR:  THE MOVING PARTY SERVES COPIES OF THE ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND  

MOTION DOCUMENTS ON THE OPPOSING PARTY   

If the judge or judicial referee issues an order to show cause, the moving party is required to 
arrange to serve all of the following on the opposing party: 

•  Copy of the signed and dated Order to Show Cause; 
•  Copy of the signed and dated Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 
•  Copy of the signed and dated Brief in Support of Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 
•  Copy of the signed and dated Affidavit in Support of Motion for an Order to Show 

Cause; and 

•  Copy of any supporting documents filed with the court ; 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The opposing party must be served 
with one copy of each of the documents filed with the clerk of court (except the Confidential 
Information Form).  The service rules for motions are in Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of 
Civil Procedure.  See Rule 5(b)(3) for service rules for self-represented litigants.  

Service information, including blank proof of service forms, is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

See the instructions and forms for “Service After a Civil Action Has Started.”

WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER THE ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE 
AND COPIES OF THE MOTION DOCUMENTS ARE SERVED 

THE OPPOSING PARTY MUST ATTEND THE HEARING!  

The opposing party’s failure to attend the hearing may result in the opposing party being found 
in contempt of court. 

The opposing party should be prepared to tell their side, challenge the moving party’s evidence, 
and present their own evidence. 

THE OPPOSING PARTY MAY ANSWER OR RESPOND IN WRITING TO THE MOTION FOR ORDER  

TO SHOW CAUSE  

Generally, if the moving party has arranged to serve the order to show cause and motion 
documents by personal delivery or at the opposing party’s office, the opposing party has 14* 
calendar days to serve and file their answer brief and supporting documents. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion was personally delivered or left at the office. 

If the moving party arranged to serve the order to show cause and motion documents by mail 
or third party commercial carrier, the opposing party has  17* calendar days to serve and file 
their answer brief and supporting documents. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion was mailed. 

*TO THE OPPOSING PARTY:  Be aware that there may not always be 14 or 17 days as outlined 
above to file and serve an answer to the motion for an order to show cause. 

The exception may be when a hearing has been scheduled before that time period has run.  If 
you, the opposing party, don’t have that amount of time, you MUST serve and file your answer 
before the hearing date. 

If the opposing party doesn’t serve and file an answer brief, the court may consider the failure 
an admission that the moving party’s motion has merit.  The moving party will still be required 
to prove they meet the requirements of the laws or rules that apply to the moving party’s 
motion.

Carefully review the information and resources on the “Answering a Motion” webpage! 

Generally, to answer a motion for an order to show cause, the opposing party files the 
following documents with the North Dakota state court that granted the judgment or order the 
moving party wants enforced. 

•  Answer Brief to Motion for an Order to Show Cause; 

o  A written response that explains why the party filing the motion shouldn’t have 
the motion for an order to show cause granted.  An answer brief takes the 
relevant laws or rules and explains how the opposing party’s facts listed in the 
answer brief apply to the situation that led to the motion. 

•  Opposing Party’s Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief to Motion for an Order to Show 

Cause; 

o  A written statement of fact about which the opposing party has first-hand 
knowledge.  Facts referred to in the brief must also appear in the affidavit. 

•  Other supporting documents (other affidavits, exhibits, etc.); and 
•  Confidential Information Form 

(www.ndcourts.gov/Media/Default/Legal%20Resources/rules/ndrct/Appendix-H.pdf). 

The case number will be the case number from the moving party’s motion.   

The following General-Use forms are available on the “Answering a Motion” webpage.   

The moving party may find the General-Use motion forms useful as a starting point for creating 
their own motion documents.  

•  Answer Brief to Motion form; 
•  Affidavit form; 
•  Caption and Signature form. 

Examples of documents can be found in the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual 
here: www.legalassist.org/?id=128&page=ND+Family+Law+Manual.  The Family Law Manual 
was created for lawyers in divorce cases.

PREPARE FOR THE HEARING!!!  

Organize the information, documents, etc., that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At a 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

The moving party must prove the statements in their motion documents.  The moving party 
must prove that the opposing party clearly committed contempt of court, and prove that the 
opposing party had a willful and inexcusable intent to commit contempt of court. 

The opposing party can challenge the moving party’s evidence and statements and present 
their own evidence. 

An Evidence research guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the 
“District Court Civil” section. 

CAUTION!!!  Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. Both parties are held to 
the same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if they don’t understand the rules 
or procedures.  Both parties will need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

BOTH PARTIES MUST ATTEND THE HEARING   

REMEMBER: 

• 

• 

If the moving party does not attend the hearing, their motion may be dismissed. 

If the opposing party does not attend the hearing, the judge or judicial referee may 
think they are admitting to the allegations in the motion and the opposing party may be 
found in contempt of court. 

If you cannot appear in person, you can ask the court for permission to attend a hearing by 
telephone or by some other reliable electronic means. 

•  NOTE:  The court is not required to grant this type of request. 

The Appear by Phone or Other Electronic Means form set is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Miscellaneous” section. 

There may be more than one hearing, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.  Be 
prepared for every hearing. 

**Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Don’t miss your hearing date and time. If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get 
to court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the courthouse as soon as you can.

CONDUCT OF THE HEARING:   

The judge or judicial referee hears both sides and then decides whether to issue an order 
finding the opposing party in contempt.  Sometimes, the order to show cause is issued at the 
end of the hearing.  Sometimes, the order to show cause is issued at a later date.  

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the moving party goes first. 

•  The Moving Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The moving party presents their case first. 
o  The opposing party may cross-examine witnesses and object to the moving 

party’s evidence. 

•  The Opposing Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The opposing party presents their case after the moving party. 
o  The moving party may cross-examine witnesses and object to the opposing 

party’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the opposing party goes first. 

The judge or judicial referee of the district court will decide if the moving party proved the 
grounds for the order to show cause.  If the judge or judicial referee decides the moving party 
proved the grounds for the order to show cause, an order to show cause against the opposing 
party will be issued. 

BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE COURTHOUSE   

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next.

Cause. 

Plaintiff submits this Brief in Support of her Motion for the issuance of an Order to Show 

[#2]  An interim order was issued by this court on July 15, 2015, requiring the Defendant to 

pay for one-half of daycare expenses.  A divorce judgment was issued by this court on 

December 12, 2015, ordering Defendant to pay for one-half of all unreimbursed medical 

expenses related to the parties three (3) minor children.  This court additionally issued an 

Amended Judgment on December 12, 2017, and a Second Amended Judgment on December 

12, 2019.  Each amended judgment required the Defendant to pay for one-half of all 

unreimbursed medical expenses for the children. 

[#3] 

The affidavit of Jane Doe that has been filed with this Brief demonstrates the 

Defendant’s disregard and contempt for this court’s authority and directives within the multiple 

Judgments and Orders that have been issued by this court.  Specifically, the Defendant has 

failed to reimburse Plaintiff for his court ordered share of the children’s unreimbursed medical

bills and daycare expenses.  The Defendant’s statements made to the Plaintiff regarding his 

unwillingness to reimburse his share of the children’s medical expenses reflect his willful 

disregard for the divorce judgment. 

LAW AND ARGUMENT 

[#4] 

The Defendant has not followed the divorce judgment and interim order in this case.  

Under N.D.C.C. § 27-10-01.1(1)(c), “contempt of court” is defined as: 

Intentional disobedience, resistance, or obstruction of the authority, process, 
or order of a court officer including a referee or magistrate; 
 

A court of records of this state may impose a remedial or punitive sanction for contempt of 

court under this chapter.  N.D.C.C. § 27-10-01.2(1). 

[#5]  When imposing contempt under N.D.C.C. chapter 27-10, a court must first consider 

whether a remedial or punitive sanction is applicable, and then apply the appropriate 

procedures for imposing the sanction.  Millang v. Hahn, 582 N.W.2d 665, 667 (N.D. 1998), citing 

Endersbe v. Endersbe, 555 N.W.2d 580, 582 (N.D. 1996). 

[#6]  North Dakota Century Code § 27-10-01.4(1) provides remedial sanctions that may be 

imposed and states as follows: 

a.   Payment of a sum of money sufficient to compensate a party or complainant, 
other than the court, for a loss or injury suffered as a result of the contempt, 
including an amount to reimburse the party for costs and expenses incurred 
as a result of the contempt;  

.   Imprisonment if the contempt of court is of a type included in subdivision b, 
c, d, e, or f of subsection 1 of section 27-10-01.1. The imprisonment may 
extend for as long as the contemnor continues the contempt or six months, 
whichever is shorter;

Brief in Support of Motion for Order to Show Cause Formatting Example – Use at Your Own Risk 

c.   A forfeiture not to exceed two thousand dollars for each day the contempt 

continues;  

. An order designed to ensure compliance with a previous order of the court; or  

.   A sanction other than the sanctions specified in subdivisions a through d if 

the court expressly finds that those sanctions would be ineffectual to 
terminate a continuing contempt. 

In this case, the Defendant has intentionally disobeyed the interim order and multiple 

7] 

  [

judgments issued by the Court.  Defendant’s conduct in failing to abide by the terms of the 

divorce judgment constitutes contempt of court and he should be punished accordingly.  The 

Defendant should not only be ordered to immediately comply with the divorce judgment, he 

should also be responsible for costs and attorney fees Plaintiff has incurred because of the 

Defendant’s contempt. 

CONCLUSION 

[#8] 

Because the Defendant had notice of the terms of the interim order and divorce 

judgment, the Plaintiff submits there is no legal justification for the Defendant’s failure to 

comply with the terms of the divorce judgment.  Therefore, the Plaintiff asks this Court to issue 

an Order to Show Cause to the Defendant granting the relief requested in the Plaintiff’s motion. 

Dated this 25th day of March, 2020.

  1

Jane Doe states as follows: 

I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter and I reside at 1111 Anywhere Street, 

Anytown, Anystate 00000, with my three minor children:  A.A.D., B.E.D., and C.I.D.  I am 

employed with the Anyemployer Company. 

2. 

The Defendant in this matter, Joe Doe, resides at 0000 Anywhere Street, Anytown, 

Anystate 00000.  I do not know where Joe Doe is employed. 

3. 

I make this affidavit in support of my Motion for Order to Show Cause and the 

statements herein are based upon my own personal knowledge and belief. 

4. 

My divorce from Joe Doe was final from this Court on December 12, 2015.  Since that 

time, there have been two amended judgments entered, one on December 12, 2017, and a 

Second Amended Judgment on December 12, 2019. 

5. 

Pursuant to the Judgment, Joe Doe was ordered to reimburse me for one-half of all 

unreimbursed medical expenses that are paid on behalf of our children.

6. 

Pursuant to the Amended Judgment, dated December 12, 2017, Joe Doe was ordered to 

reimburse me for one-half of all daycare costs incurred for our children.  Joe Doe has never 

reimbursed me for this amount. 

7. 

I have sent copies of the bills to Joe Doe on numerous occasions regarding the medical 

expenses.  I have included examples of such notices as Exhibit #1.  I have hand delivered copies, 

emailed, and mailed copies of the notices.  Joe Doe continues to come up with excuses as to 

why he should not be responsible for the medical expenses and does not pay me. 

8. 

At this time, half of the outstanding medical bills for which Joe Doe has not reimbursed 

me total $7,303.28.  See Exhibit #2.  The total includes the following: 

2015. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $   660.08 
2016. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $   222.02

2019. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,650.00 
2020 (to date) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $   333.09 

Total Amount Owing. . . . . . . . . . . .  $7,303.28 

   

 

9. 

On February 4, 2020, I sent Joe Doe a letter requesting payment for unreimbursed 

medical expenses.  See Exhibit #3. 

10. 

Joe Doe has refused to pay for any part of the children’s daycare expenses.  He currently 

owes me $1,765.00 for his half of daycare expenses.  See Exhibit #4.  His refusal to pay daycare 

expenses is a reflection of his attitude on reimbursing me one-half for the daycare expenses. 

11. 

The issue of unreimbursed medical and daycare expenses has been ongoing issues.  In 

2018, I hired Octavis Spentz to address the issue of unreimbursed medical expenses and all of 

this was brought to Joe Doe’s attention.  He still refused to make any payments.  See Exhibit #5.

12. 

Through all of this, the only payment Joe Doe has ever made to me is a payment for 

$66.00 on January 4, 2016.  I marked that amount as paid in Exhibit #2 and have not included 

that in the total owed in paragraph eight. 

13. 

I believe Joe Doe feels as though he is not responsible for half of these expenses 

because he pays child support pursuant to the North Dakota Child Support Guidelines.  I have 

had a lot of communication with Joe Doe that illustrates this.  For example, he refers to child 

support as “welfare,” and claims I am stealing from him.  He also became very angry with me in 

2019 because I wouldn’t use the money from “one week of 52 weeks” of child support to buy 

our daughter running shoes and gear.  Attached are examples of such statements as Exhibit #6. 

14. 

For all the reasons stated herein, I am asking for an order to Show Cause against Joe 

Doe.  I am also respectfully requesting that if Joe Doe is found in contempt of court, that he also

ANSWER BRIEF TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION 
FOR ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE 
 

FACTS 

Plaintiff, Dox Glean (“Dox”), and Defendant, Dora Smeath (“Dora”), are the biological 

¶1] 

  [

parents of S.O.G., born 2011.  In April 2014, Dox initiated this action to establish primary 

residential responsibility and a parenting plan for S.O.G.  In October 2014, a Judgment was 

entered which provided Dox with primary residential responsibility for S.O.G., and provided 

Dora with reasonable supervised parenting time.  The supervised parenting time was to occur 

twice monthly at Visitation Place in Notown, North Dakota. 

[¶2] 

In 2015, motions were filed by both Dora and Dox regarding residential responsibility 

and parenting time for S.O.G.  In July 2016, an Amended Judgment was entered in this matter, 

which changed the location of Dora’s supervised visitation from Visitation Place in Notown, 

North Dakota, to Kid’s Place in Sotown, North Dakota. 

[¶3] 

In October 2017, Dora again filed a motion to modify the parenting plan.  Dox and Dora 

came to an agreement and each signed a stipulation.  In December 2017, an Amended

Judgment was approved by the Court.  Pursuant to the Amended Judgment, Dox remained the 

parent with primary residential responsibility.  Dora was allowed unsupervised parenting time 

and a parenting time schedule was established in the Amended Judgment.  Dora was allocated 

six unsupervised weekends of parenting time from December, 2017, through May, 2018.  

Additionally, if Dora successfully completed the unsupervised parenting time and completed 

the Parent Class, she was allocated three weeks of summer parenting time with S.O.G.  Dora 

completed the class and provided proof of completion of the Parent Class. 

[¶4] 

The Second Amended Judgment specifically conditioned the three summer weeks of 

parenting time upon Dora completing the parenting class and completing six continuous 

months of parenting time on the weekend.  The Second Amended Judgment states 

“Specifically, there must be six months of no missed visits in order for the week long summer 

visits to be exercised.”  See Second Amended Judgment, Doc ID #22 at ¶ 12.  The Second 

Amended Judgment further states, “If either obligation set forth in paragraph 6 or 7 above is 

not met, Defendant shall have only one weekend of parenting time until six continuous months 

of parenting time have been exercised.”  Id.at ¶ 13.  The Second Amended judgment also states 

“If Defendant is more than fifteen (15) minutes late for exchanges without communicating with 

the other parent, the parenting time shall be forfeited for that weekend.”  Id. at ¶ 15. 

[¶5]  Dora successfully completed her parenting time with S.O.G. in December 2018, January 

2019, February 2019, March 2019, and May 2019.  However, Dora did not successfully 

complete her parenting time with S.O.G. in April 2019.  Dox arrived with S.O.G. at the Sotown 

Police Department on April 22, 2019, to exchange S.O.G.  Dora did not appear.  Officer Jones of

Answer to Motion for Order to Show Cause Formatting Example – Use at Your Own Risk 

the Sotown Police Department contacted Dora at approximately 9:15 a.m. to see when she was 

going to arrive for the exchange.  See Defendant’s Exhibit A.  Dora informed Officer Jones that 

she would not be there as she believed the exchange time was 5:00 p.m.  See Defendant’s 

Exhibit A. 

[¶6]  Because of this, Dox informed Dora in writing on June 1, 2019, that she was not in 

compliance with the Second Amended Judgment and, therefore, the parenting time of three 

weeks in the summer was forfeited until Dora successfully completed her parenting time of six 

weekend visits with S.O.G.  See Defendant’s Exhibit A.  Dox provided Katie with a parenting 

time schedule for another six consecutive weekends.  See Defendant’s Exhibit A. 

[¶7]  Dora has now filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause to hold Dox in contempt of court, 

requesting an award of attorney’s fees, and requesting an award of sanctions.  While Dora’s 

motion and brief do not indicate what sanctions are being requested, Dora’s affidavit indicates 

she is requesting cost of travel and makeup parenting time.  Dox objects to Dora’s motion to 

find him in contempt of court and for an award to Dora of sanctions and attorney’s fees, based 

on the following Law and Argument. 

LAW AND ARGUMENT 

[¶8] 

The North Dakota Supreme Court has held “In a civil contempt proceeding under 

N.D.C.C. ch. 27-10, a complainant must clearly and satisfactorily show that the alleged 

contempt has been committed.  In order to warrant a remedial sanction for contempt, there 

must be a willful and inexcusable intent to violate a court order.”  Berg v. Berg, 2000 ND 37, ¶ 

10, 606 N.W.2d 903 (internal citations committed).  In this case, it is Dora who has not complied

Answer to Motion for Order to Show Cause Formatting Example – Use at Your Own Risk 

with the terms of the Amended Judgment in order to exercise her three weeks of summer 

parenting time with S.O.G.  This is shown through the affidavits of Dox Glean, and his wife, Mae 

Glean, and the incorporated exhibits.  Further, the history regarding Dora’s path from primary 

residential responsibility for S.O.G. to supervised parenting time with S.O.G., to unsupervised 

parenting time with S.O.G., is one of the primary reasons the Second Amended Judgment was 

formulated in the fashion that it was.  As show by the Affidavit of Dox Glean, Dora has a history 

of failing to follow through and failing to read or comply with court ordered directives.  It is also 

shown in the Affidavit of Dox Glean that it was a big step for him to agree to unsupervised 

parenting time, and it came with stipulations.  In the past and moving forward, Dox has nothing 

but S.O.G.’s best interests in mind.  Under the facts presented to the court, Dox should not be 

held in contempt of court. 

[¶9]   North Dakota law defines contempt of court as follows: 

a.   Intentional misconduct in the presence of the court which interferes with 

the court proceeding or with the administration of justice, or which impairs 
the respect due the court;  

b.  Intentional nonpayment of a sum of money ordered by the court to be paid 
in a case when by law execution cannot be awarded for the collection of the 
sum;  

c.  Intentional disobedience, resistance, or obstruction of the authority, process, 

or order of a court or other officer, including a referee or magistrate;  

d.  Intentional refusal of a witness to appear for examination, to be sworn or to 

affirm, or to testify after being ordered to do so by the court;  

e.  Intentional refusal to produce a record, document, or other object after 

f. 

being ordered to do so by the court;  
Intentional behavior in derogation of any provision of a summons issued 
pursuant to rule 8.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court; or  

g.  Any other act or omission specified in the court rules or by law as a ground 

for contempt of court.

Answer to Motion for Order to Show Cause Formatting Example – Use at Your Own Risk 

[¶10]  Based upon the facts in this case, as set forth in the affidavits of Dox Glean and Mae 

Glean, mention must be made of the frivolous nature of Dora’s claim of contempt.  In order to 

be found guilty of contempt of court, the accused must have unintentionally violated one of the 

seven provisions outlined in N.D.C.C. § 27-10-01.1(1)(a-g).  A careful examination of the 

statutory definition of contempt of court as applied to the facts in this case will show beyond 

any doubt that Dox is not guilty of contempt as alleged by Dora. 

[¶11] 

It is first necessary to note that Dora has not identified which subsection of the 

contempt of court statute Dox has allegedly violated.  Since Dora has not specifically identified 

which section of the code has been violated, it is reasonable to presume that she does not truly 

believe the Dox has violated any of the provisions of N.D.C.C. § 27-10-01.1.  A careful review of 

each provision of this section will confirm this presumption is correct. 

[¶12]  Based upon a reading of the plain language of the definition of contempt of court, it 

does not appear that Dox has violated any of the provisions outlined under North Dakota law.  

Further, Dora has not alleged that Dox has violated any of these sections, which would form the 

basis for a motion of contempt of court.  The only subsection which may apply to Dora’s 

allegations of contempt is subsection N.D.C.C. § 27-10-01.1(1)(c) which provides that one may 

be held in contempt of court for intentional disobedience of the authority, process, or order of 

a court. 

[¶11]  First, Dora has not alleged that Dox violated this subsection in either her moving papers 

or in her affidavit.  Second, as shown by the affidavits of Dox Glean and Mae Glean and the 

incorporated exhibits, Dora is the party who violated the Amended Judgment by failing to

Answer to Motion for Order to Show Cause Formatting Example – Use at Your Own Risk 

successfully complete six consecutive months of weekend parenting time with S.O.G. to entitle 

her to exercise her parenting time of three weeks during the summer school break as outlined 

in the Second Amended Judgment.  In order for Dox to have intentionally violated the Second 

Amended Judgment, Dora would have had to successfully complete her six consecutive months 

of parenting time, which she has not done.  Dox has not denied Dora any of the weekend 

parenting time, and if he had done so, intentionally, that likely would have constituted 

contempt of court.  Therefore, Dox has not intentionally violated the Second Amended 

Judgment and should not be found in contempt of court. 

[¶14]  Based upon the above law and argument, it is clear that Dora’s motion requesting Dox 

be held in contempt of court for violating a court order is frivolous.  In order for Dox to be in 

contempt of court, he must have violated the Second Amended Judgment, which is essentially 

the order of the court.  In this case, Dora violated the terms of the Second Amended Judgment, 

not Dox, and Dox should not be held in contempt of court for Dora’s error.  There is a complete 

absence of actual facts or law that a reasonable person would have thought a court would 

render judgment in Dora’s favor.  As a result, pursuant to the provisions of N.D.C.C. § 28-26-01, 

Dox requests that the court make a finding that Dora’s claim for relief is frivolous, and award 

Dox reasonable actual and statutory cots, including reasonable attorney’s fees, for responding 

to Dora’s motion for contempt. 

CONCLUSIONS 

[¶14]  Based upon the facts in this case, Dox is not guilty of contempt of court as defined in 

N.D.C.C. § 27-10-01.1(1).  Dox has not violated the Second Amended Judgment as it relates to

the week-long parenting time between Dora and S.O.G.  In fact, pursuant to the terms of the 

Second Amended Judgment, Dora violated the provisions and that is the reason the week-long 

parenting time is not being honored by Dox.  Dora admit in her affidavit that she missed the 

pick-up time for the April 2019 weekend parenting time with S.O.G. as listed in the Second 

Amended Judgment.  In fact, given Dora’s admission that she did not comply with the Second 

Amended Judgment, Dox believes that the motion for contempt is devoid of any factual or legal 

basis and that it should be found to be frivolous and Dox should be awarded his reasonable 

actual and statutory costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

Dox Glean states as follows: 

Defendant’s Motion for Order to Show Cause. 

I am the father of S.O.G., born 2011. 

       

2. 

3. 

1. 

I am the Plaintiff in the above-entitled matter and make this affidavit in response to 

A Judgment was entered in October 2014 which provided me with primary residential 

responsibility of S.O.G., subject to Defendant’s (“Dora”) reasonable supervised parenting time.  

Dora’s supervised parenting time was to occur twice monthly at Visitation Place in Notown, 

North Dakota.  My request for primary residential responsibility and the requirement that 

Dora’s parenting time be supervised was due in part to Dora’s abuse of prescription medication 

and marijuana, Dora not providing a stable home for S.O.G., the individuals Dora were 

introducing to S.O.G., Dora’s inability to maintain employment, financial stability for S.O.G., the 

inability of Dora to maintain telephone contact with me and S.O.G., the denial of my parenting 

time, and a concern for S.O.G.’s health.  Specifically, with regards to S.O.G.’s health, S.O.G. was

hospitalized with a severe abscess in his mouth, which required teeth extraction through 

surgery, crowns on his remaining teeth, and filings before he was three years old. 

4. 

 In 2015, Dora left Notown, North Dakota, with S.O.G., which necessitated me filing a 

motion with the court for the return of S.O.G.  Dora also filed a motion on the same date for an 

Ex Parte Interim Order with regard to S.O.G.  In July 2016, an Amended Judgment was entered 

in this matter, which altered only the location of Dora’s supervised visitation from Visitation 

Place in Notown, North Dakota, to Kid’s Place in Sotown, North Dakota. 

5. 

In October 2017, Dora again filed a motion to modify the parenting plan.  Dora and I 

came to an agreement and signed a stipulation.  In December 2017, a Second Amended 

Judgment was approved by the court.  Pursuant to the Second Amended Judgment, I remained 

the parent with primary residential responsibility.  Dora was allowed unsupervised parenting 

time and a parenting schedule was put in the Second Amended Judgment.  Dora was allocated 

parenting time of six unsupervised weekends from December 2017, through May 2018.  

Additionally, if Dora successfully completed the Parent Class, she was allocated parenting time 

of three weeks in the summer.  Dora completed the class and provided proof of completion of 

the Parent Class. 

6. 

The Second Amended Judgment specifically conditioned Dora’s parenting time for three 

weeks in the summer upon Dora completing the Parent Class and completing six continuous 

months of weekend parenting time.  Dora was not supposed to miss any of the monthly 

weekend parenting time to trigger the parenting time of three weeks in the summer.  If Dora 

did not complete parenting time of continuous six weekends, then she had to start over and

Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief to Motion Formatting Example – Use at Your Own Risk 

complete parenting time of six continuous weekends prior to being entitled to the three weeks 

of parenting time in the summer.  Finally, the Second Amended Judgment states that Dora 

forfeits her parenting time if she is more than 15 minutes late for a visit. 

7. 

Dora successfully completed her visitation with S.O.G. in December 2018, January 2019, 

February 2019, March 2019, and May 2019.  However, Dora did not successfully complete her 

visitation with S.O.G. in April 2019.  The Second Amended Judgment provided that Dora was to 

have parenting time with S.O.G. the weekend of April 22, 2019, through April 24, 2019.  Her 

parenting time was to commence at 9:00 a.m. on April 22 and end at 5:00 p.m. on April 24.  On 

the morning of April 22, 2019, I traveled to the Sotown Police Department, which is where Dora 

and I exchange S.O.G.  I was met by Officer Jones of the Sotown Police Department to assist 

with the exchange.  See Defendant’s Exhibit A.  At 9:15 a.m., I told Officer Jones I would be 

willing to wait until 9:20 a.m. for Dora to arrive.  Officer Jones contacted Dora by telephone and 

I was advised that Dora would not be arriving as she thought the pickup time was 5:00 p.m.  See 

Defendant’s Exhibit A.  I went home with S.O.G. 

8. 

The Second Amended Judgment indicates that Dora is supposed to contact me if she is 

going to be late for an exchange.  Prior to Dora contacting me on April 22, 2019, after Officer 

Jones contacted her, Dora had not contacted me since April 9, 2019.  See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1 

(phone call history) and Exhibit 2 (missed calls and times from Dora).  As the phone records 

indicate, Dora did not contact me to confirm or discuss the pickup time for S.O.G.  Additionally, 

Dora did not send me a text message or try to communicate with me in any other manner 

regarding her parenting time with S.O.G. the weekend of April 22, 2019.  See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 3

(text message from Dora).  Dora spoke with S.O.G. through my wife’s cell phone during the 

April 9, 2019, through April 22, 2019, timeframe. 

9. 

Because both S.O.G. and Dora were very upset about the missed visit, my wife, Mae 

Glean, went to the Sotown Police Department to speak with Dora.  After speaking with Dora, 

we did allow Dora to come to our residence to see S.O.G.  While at our residence, we allowed 

Dora to take S.O.G. for the night, for S.O.G.’s benefit.  I informed Dora that I was under no 

obligation to allow her to see S.O.G., but I did not want to deprive S.O.G. of her time with Dora.  

It was made very clear to S.O.G. that us allowing her to take S.O.G. overnight was not a makeup 

visit. 

10. 

Dora indicates in her affidavit that her tardiness was a mistake.  Dora also stated that 

she has never been late for a visit.  Dora did not mention that she missed a supervised visit with 

S.O.G. on August 20, 2017.  See Plaintiff Exhibit 4.  Dora told the staff at Kid’s Place that she 

thought the visit was the following weekend.  See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 4.  This is a recurring theme 

with Dora and one of the reasons that the Second Amended Judgment had specific visitation 

dates and time outlined.  This does not only occur without regard to S.O.G., but with other 

aspects of Dora’s life as well.  See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 5 (Letter from Dora to Honorable Smith 

explaining whey she missed her court date in 2015).  There were no hearings scheduled in June, 

July, or August with regard to custody of S.O.G.  See Odyssey entries in case number 01-2014-

DM-0001. 

11. 

I do have concerns about S.O.G. when she is with Dora.  Dora was charged with 

Disobedience of a Judicial Order in 2016 in Whatcounty District Court, case number 60-DM-

0001, for taking S.O.G. from supervised visitation at Kid’s Place.  See Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6.  With 

all of the issues that have arisen over the years, I have little trust in Dora, and her failure to read 

the Second Amended Judgment and follow the schedule does not help mend the trust. 

12. 

On June 1, 2019, I wrote Dora a letter informing her that she had not completed the six 

months of weekend visits successfully and, therefore, it was my understanding under the 

Second Amended Judgment that she would need to start her six months of weekend visitations

I do not believe that I am in violation of North Dakota law regarding contempt of court.  

I have complied with the terms of the Second Amended Judgment.  Dora has not complied with 

the terms of the Second Amended Judgment and now wants the court to hold me in contempt

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
