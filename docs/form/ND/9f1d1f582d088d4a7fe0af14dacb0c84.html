VOLUME 49 ∙ NUMBER 1 ∙ JANUARY 2019

LUNAR ROCKS AND 
METEORITE SAMPLES 

The  North  Dakota  State  Library  will  be 
borrowing  Lunar  and  Meteorite  Sample 
Disks from NASA at the beginning of June 
and would like to take them around the 
state so public libraries can benefit from 
this opportunity.

If  your  library  would  like  to  hold  a 
program  where  your  patrons  can  look 
at  the  lunar  rocks  and  meteorites  and  
learn more about them between June 5 
and June 14, send an e-mail to BreAnne 
Meier  at  ndslpa@nd.gov  by  February  4, 
2019.  Please  indicate  which  date(s)  and 
time(s)  work  for  you  during  that  time 
period  and  we’ll  try  to  get  to  as  many 
libraries as possible.

The  only  requirement  to  participate  in 
this incredible opportunity is check with 
your  local  police  department  and  see  if 
they  can  send  an  officer  as  security  for 
the disks.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

With the start of a new legislative session, it 
seems like a good time to once again share 
thoughts  on  why  advocacy  is  important. 
Simply  put,  advocacy  is  sharing  your  story. 
Libraries  have  many  stories  to  share,  but 
the  most  important  one  is  that  we  are  still 
relevant.  Libraries  of  today  are  so  much 
more  than  a  repository  of  books,  but  some 
people don’t realize that. We need to get out 
there and share all of the wonderful things 
happening in our libraries. 

libraries  are  making  a 
North  Dakota 
difference  in  the  communities  that  they 
serve  every  single  day  with  the  materials, 
services,  and  programs  that  we  offer.  It  
is  important  that  we  let  the  whole  world, 
or  at  least  the  whole  state,  know  that.  
Advocacy  stories  vary  by  library  -  using  a 
3D  printer  to  create  a  tool  for  a  farmer  to 
fix  his  farm  implement,    providing  online  
resources to the academic students that are 
attending  courses  online,  promoting  early 
literacy to children and families, and assisting 
with  workforce  development 
through 
resume creation and online applications, to 
name a few. 

Formal and informal advocacy opportunities 
present themselves often. You are probably 
doing informal advocacy all the time without 
even  realizing  it.  Sharing  information  via 
social media, Reader’s Advisory or reference 
help,  and  providing  assistance  at  the 
computers  are  all  informal  opportunities 
for  you  to  show  the  value  of  your  library. 
Advocacy  is  simply  taking  advantage  of 
those opportunities. 

or 

provost 

Formal  advocacy  might  include  contacting 
legislators about a bill that impacts libraries, 
at  both  the  state  and  federal  levels.  It  
might  also  include  giving  a  “State  of  the 
Library”  report  to  your  city  or  county 
government, 
university  
President,  or  to  another  funding  partner. 
Formal advocacy includes the annual report 
that  public  libraries  are  required  to  give 
to  their  funding  authority.  If  you  have  an 
opportunity  to  present  to  a  community 
group  such  as  Rotary,  Kiwanis,  or  the 
Chamber  of  Commerce,  take  it.  Take  any  
and  all  opportunities  to  tell  your  library’s 
story.  This  can  and  should  be  done  by  all 
members  of  the  library  staff  as  well  as  the 
library  board,  school  administration  or 
academic  institution  leadership.  It’s  your  
job  to  let  others  know  the  story  that  they 
should tell. 

It is important to find your library champions 
in  the  community  that  you  serve,  no  
matter  what  type  of  library  that  you  are. 
If  there  are  no  champions,  then  your  job  is 
a  little  harder  because  you  have  to  create 
them.  How  do  you  do  this?  Tell  them  the  
right  library  story  -  one  that  ties  into  their 
interests  and  shows  them  the  value  of  the 
library from their perspective. 

I invite you to share your library story with me 
so that I can be the most effective advocate 
for  the  North  Dakota  Library  Community 
possible.  Reach  out  to  me  via  email,  social 
media, or give me a call at the State Library.

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

NEWSSTREAM

Newsstream  is  the  newspaper  database  that  the  State  Library  subscribes  to  for  your  convenience. This 
database  has  the  most  popular  newspapers  in  the  country  as  well  as  local  papers  such  as  the  Bismarck 
Tribune and the Grand Forks Herald. This is a great place to find those New York Times articles without having 
a subscription to the newspaper. It has everything that the subscribers would get except the photographs 
and the ads. That’s a pretty good trade.

The database has the most recent issues of each newspaper, and it will even tell you how far back the paper 
is digitized (generally through the 1980s). What most people don’t know is that the database also covers 
Magazines, Scholarly Journals, Podcasts, Trade Journals, and more. So not only can you get newspapers 
without having to pay extra, but you can take that information and do further research within the same 
database. A free account can be made, and through that all of the newspapers or different articles can all be 
saved in one spot. This is perfect for students who are told they need to find an article in a newspaper, and 
they don’t know where to go for one. Have them check out this database and see what is available!

FAKE NEWS?

The online classroom that has taught thousands of students about astronomy, history, and politics is now 
tackling the internet. More accurately, they are aiming to teach students and adults alike how to evaluate 
the  content  that  they  consume  online.  In  this  10  episode  web-series  (each  episode  is  10–15  minutes  in 
length), John Green and the Crash Course team (partnered with MediaWise, The Poynter Institute, and The 
Stanford History Education Group) will provide a practical guide to navigating the internet and dive in to 
the important things to consider while scrolling through newsfeeds.

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT: 
PHOTOBOOTH DISPLAY

Tired  of  the  same  old  display  ideas?  Consider 
tying  them  in  with  a  passive  program.  Adding 
a  ‘photobooth’  or  other  interactive  element  to 
displays  will  ramp  up  patron  engagement  and 
excitement  about  the  theme.  For Valentine’s  Day, 
create  a  cupid  and  hearts  photobooth  to  go  on 
display next to the books or set up a voting station 
for everyone to pick their favorite founding father 
for President’s Day. The increased engagement with 
the  photobooth  will  draw  patrons  in  towards  the 
books on display. If parents take photos, encourage 
them to tag the library on social media as well for 
some free advertising! See more photobooth and 
book display ideas here: http://bit.ly/2Tfke8Z.

BLIND DATE WITH A BOOK

Blind Date With A Book has begun this year! The 
books and audiobooks have all been wrapped and 
are ready to spend some time with you! Each item 
has  been  labeled  Fiction,  Nonfiction,  and  Large 
Print, along with the first sentence, just to give you 
a little bit of a clue as to what you’re checking out.

Be adventurous and read a book that you may not 
have checked out otherwise. Who knows, maybe 
you’ll find your new favorite book!

Please  contact  us  via  e-mail  (statelib@nd.gov)  or 
by phone (701-328-4622) and we will send a blind 
date book or audiobook to you right away.

SUMMER READING MANUALS

The  2019  Summer  Reading  Manuals  are  now  available!  Just  like  last  year,  the 
State  Library  is  providing  downloadable  manuals.  To  receive  an  e-mail  with 
directions  on  how  to  retrieve  an  access  code,  please  fill  out  the  request  form:

participants once digitization is complete. All participants will be provided flash drives with digital copies 
of their items. 

Each participant may bring a maximum of 10 items. Participants may drop off their items or wait for them 
to be scanned. 

Where: Memorial Hall, First Floor, North Dakota State Capitol
When: Tuesday, March 12, 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM

If you have any questions, email ndsl-digital@nd.gov

VALOR FOUNDATION

The Valor Foundation in Hollywood, Florida, is making available to all North Dakota libraries (and related 
organizations) books free-of-charge. These are highly inspirational, non-denominational books that might 
be a welcome addition to any library. 

For more information and to fill out the book request form, please visit their website or contact Kenia Lee-
Quintana at kclee@tobinprop.com or (954) 989-3009.

1923 SKIDOO
Submitted by Shari Mosser

It has been 96 years since Robert Frost published “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.”  A poem all 
North Dakotans are familiar with because it is a poem about snow and miles to travel.  Now, it will be even 
more widely known, and maybe not just for its literary value and exceptional imagery. Instead, it will be one 
of many literary works that as of January 1, 2019, will pass into the public domain.  The public domain refers 
to creative works that are not protected by copyright, trademark or patent laws. The public owns these 
works and not an individual author or artist.  

“The  public  domain  has  been  frozen  in  time  for  20  years,  and  we’re  reaching  the  20-year  thaw,”  says 
Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke Law School’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. The freeze in 
these  creative  works  moving  into  the  public  domain  is  often  blamed  on  Mickey  Mouse.    In  1998,  many 
corporations  (including  Disney)  advocated  for  copyright  protection  for  a  longer  period  of  time.    At  that 
time works published before January 1, 1978 were granted 75 years of protection.  After January 1, 1978, 
all works were entitled to protection for the lifetime of the author plus 50 years.  Congress then passed 
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act which then added 20 years of extra protection.  Another 
additional component of the Sonny Bono Act was that no copyrighted work could enter the public domain 
until 2019.  So works that were published in 1923 were held from entering the public domain until now.  

So go out and celebrate!  Remix Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments. Or mash together some short 
films  starring  Laurel  and  Hardy,  Buster  Keaton  or  Charlie  Chaplin.  Create  a  dance  to “Yes!  We  Have  No 
Bananas” (but you’ll have to sing it yourself as any recordings are still covered by copyright.)  Post whole 
books like Bambi by Felix Salten, Emily of New Moon by L.M. Montgomery, or The Inimitable Jeeves by P.G. 
Wodehouse. Or short stories from Virginia Woolf, H.P. Lovecraft, or Ernest Hemingway. Or works from Jane 
Austen, D.H. Lawrence, Edith Wharton, Aldous Huxley, Winston Churchill, Maria Montessori, Joseph Conrad, 
Zane Grey, H.G. Wells, or Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Or even poetry from Edna St. Vincent Millay, E.E. Cummings, 
Wallace Stevens, or our esteemed Robert Frost who started us down this journey.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.
And miles to go before I sleep.
And miles to go before I sleep.

Douglas’s article at Lifehacker.

JANUARY 2019

By Jessica Robinson

2019 is here! After a year of good reading in 2018, 
let’s get excited and see what 2019 has in store for 
us. This month we’ll look at some highly-anticipated 
titles for the year.

First,  Karen Thompson Walker  has  returned  with 
The Dreamers, a story in which a small college town 
is  plagued  by  a  mysterious  ailment  where  people 
fall into a permanent sleep. February 5th is a red-
letter  day  for  books,  with  four  new  titles.  Jane 
Harper’s The Lost Man takes us to Queensland for 
a  mystery  concerning  the  Bright  family.  Did  their 
middle brother, long troubled by some dark secret, 
really  walk  to  his  death  in  the  outback?  Marlon 
James won the Man Booker prize in 2015, and this 
year  he  brings  us  Black  Leopard,  Red Wolf,  where 
a  hunter-tracker  and  a  shape-shifter  try  to  find  a 
missing boy. Elizabeth McCracken’s Bowlaway starts 
with the discovery of a young woman in a cemetery, 
carrying nothing but a bowling ball, a candlepin, and 
several pounds of gold, and it follows her family over 
several generations. Finally, Christina McDonald is 
releasing what sounds like an entry for 2019’s best 
thriller with The Night Olivia Fell, the heartbreaking 
story  of  a  mother  who  is  desperate  to  learn  the 
truth when her teenage daughter falls off a bridge, 
only to be found brain-dead and pregnant.

Anissa  Gray’s  The  Care  and  Feeding  of  Ravenously 
Hungry  Girls  comes  out  February  19th  and  is  the 
story  of  three  sisters,  bound  by  past  tragedy  but 
prone to friction between the eldest sister Althea 
and  her  younger  sisters.  This  friction  increases 
when Althea and her husband are arrested, leaving 
her sisters to care for Althea’s teenage daughters. 
Daisy Jones & The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid comes 
out the beginning of March and is just the thing for 
fans of 70s rock and roll, chronicling the team-up 
of a beautiful young singer and The Six, an up-and-
coming rock band fronted by a man using the road 
to escape domestic pressures. March 19th brings us 
Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams, following the 
misadventures of a young Jamaican British woman 

reeling after a break-up with her long-term white 
boyfriend. That  day  also  brings  us  a  novel  by  Lisa 
See called The Island of Sea Women, featuring two 
best  friends  on  a  small  Korean  island  who  join  a 
tradition of women divers and watch as the world 
changes around them over several decades. Then, 
in late March, we get a debut thriller by Samantha 
Downing called My Lovely Wife - a close look at a 
couple who go a little too far in their attempts to 
spice up their marriage. 

The  beginning  of April  brings  us  Lost  and Wanted 
by  Nell  Freudenberger,  centering  on  a  physics 
professor  who  has  her  scientific  world  turned 
upside down when she receives a call from her best 
friend, two days after her death. Coming April 9th, 
Molly Dektar’s The Ash Family follows teenage Berie 
as  she’s  seduced  away  to  an  isolated  community 
that  gives  her  a  sense  of  connection  she’s  never 
felt  before  even  as  her  fellow  members  begin 
disappearing. Elizabeth Gilbert returns on June 4th 
with  another  historical  drama  called  City  of  Girls. 
This book takes us to New York in the 1940s and 
explores the time through the lens of young Vivian 
Morris,  struggling  to  find  her  identity  among  her 
aunt’s  eclectic  theater  troupe.  The  Nickel  Boys  by 
Colson  Whitehead  brings  the  early  Civil  Rights 
movement  to  life  July  16th  through  a  young  man 
named Elwood Curtis, wrongfully sent to a juvenile 
reformatory. There, Elwood finds his pacifist ideals 
tested by the abusive system and by a new friend’s 
violent convictions. Finally, we end in August with 
Katherine  Center’s  Things You  Save  in  a  Fire,  the 
story  of  a  hard-working  female  firefighter  who 
finds  her  career  ambitions  challenged  when  she 
moves to an all-male fire station.

Now  that  we  have  some  books  to  look  forward 
to this year, let’s settle into January and get ready 
for February. Next month, we’ll celebrate love and 
Valentine’s  Day  with  some  of  the  best  upcoming 
romance titles of the year.

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH:  
LIBRARY 101 PLAYLIST

This month, I’m choosing to highlight something different. Instead 
of just one video I want to highlight our entire Library 101 Playlist. 
This playlist is a group of videos that deal with some basic, yet often 
confusing,  topics  in  the  library  world.  Each  video  is  a  few  minutes 
long so getting that overview information is quick an easy. 

If you have any questions about the Library 101 videos or you would 
like to see a specific topic, please email Angie at ndlstrain@nd.gov.

The  Talking  Books  Department  at  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  has  started 
new phone hours. Patrons can call between 8:00 am and 2:00 pm. If you call after  
2:00 pm, your call will go to voicemail. Please leave a message, and we will return

MINDFULNESS
Submitted by Shari Mosser

Wellness is often talked about in today’s world filled with stress and anxiety. Wellness is an active process an 
individual takes to become aware of and making choices toward a healthy and fulfilling life. The World Health 
Organization  says “health  is  a  state  of  complete  physical,  mental,  and  social  well-being,  and  not  merely  the 
absence of disease or infirmity.”

There are eight dimensions of wellness: occupational, emotional, spiritual, environmental, financial, physical, 
social, and intellectual. And each dimension is interrelated with one another. That seems like a lot, but you and 
your library don’t have to change all at once. One tiny change is still a step forward toward becoming a better 
you! Who knows what impact it will have! And  you  don’t  have to  go  through  it alone. The  American  Library 
Association-Allied Professional Association have created a website that covers the importance of wellness in 
the workplace. They want to assist library workers address their own wellness and the wellness of their libraries.

ALA President Loida Garcia-Febo addressed the intangible benefits that mindfulness practices have for library 
workers in Jan/Feb 2019 issue of American Libraries. She states she’s had sobering conversations with libraries 
workers.  These  conversations  have  led  to  planning  webinars  on  how  to  manage  micro-aggressions  and  
workplace  stress.  She  finds  that  making  these  tools  accessible  to  our  library  workers  will  help  all  of  us,  our 
libraries, and the communities we serve.

“Wellness matters because everything we do and every emotion we feel relates to our well-being. In turn, our  
well-being directly affects our actions and emotions. It’s an ongoing circle.”

You’ve landed your dream job. Every position has its challenges, but from day one, week one, or month one,

all  of  the  above.  This  session  is  part  case  study,  part  plan,  and  part  cheerleading  session.  Gwin  Grimes,

Presenter: Sarah Brandt, Vice President of News Literacy Outreach for NewsGuard

Register: http://bit.ly/w3pTgC 

Are  your  patrons  savvy  news  consumers?  Can  they  tell  real  from  fake?  The  proliferation  of  fake  news 
has  clouded  the  digital  landscape  and  made  news  literacy  an  essential  skill  for  students  and  adults 
alike.  NewsGuard,  a  company  founded  by  a  team  of  veteran  journalists,  has  created  a  free  tool  to 
help  people  better  navigate  search  results  and  social  media  feeds.  In  this  webinar,  NewsGuard  will 
demonstrate  how  libraries  have  been  using  NewsGuard’s  browser  extension  to  help  their  patrons 
surf  the  internet  and  conduct  research  with  more  knowledge  of  the  credibility  and  transparency  of 
websites  producing  their  news.  NewsGuard  rates  and  reviews  thousands  of  news  and  information 
websites  using  nine  journalistic  standards,  issuing  each  site  a  red  or  green  rating  indicating  whether 
the  website  generally  maintains  basic  standards  of  accuracy  and  accountability.  With  the  extension 
installed,  NewsGuard’s  badges  appear  next  to  links  on  social  media  platforms  and  search  engines, 
enabling  users  to  click  and  learn  more  about  the  website’s  practices  by  reading  NewsGuard’s  
full review.

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR THE NORTH DAKOTA CENTURY CODE
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This  is  the  fourth  in  a  series  of  Flickertale  articles  
that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s 
legal reference resources.

General Index

See  the  October  2018  Flickertale,  November  2018 
Flickertale,  and  the  December  2018  Flickertale  for 
previous articles in this series.

Next  month’s  article  will  get  into  more  detail  
about  historical  legal  research  resources  for  the 
North  Dakota  Constitution  and  the  North  Dakota 
Century Code.

WHAT IS THE NORTH DAKOTA CENTURY CODE?

The  North  Dakota  Century  Code  contains  the  laws 
of  North  Dakota,  also  called  statutes,  which  are  
enacted  by  the  North  Dakota  State  Legislative 
Assembly.  The  North  Dakota  Century  Code 
is  
often  referred  to  as  the  “Century  Code,”  or  the 
“N.D.C.C.”

The  numbering  system,  also  called  the  citation, 
to  identify  specific  laws  within  the  Century  Code 
is  made  up  of  three  sets  of  numbers.  Each  set  of 
numbers  is  separated  by  a  hyphen. The  first  set  is  
the  Title,  the  second  set  is  the  Chapter  within  
the  Title,  and  the  third  set  is  the  Section  within  
the Chapter.

For  example,  Section  40-38-04  refers  to  the  fourth 
Section in Chapter 38 of Title 40. (Section 40-38-04 
lists  powers  and  duties  of  the  board  of  directors  
of a city or county library.)

Two  reference  guides  to  the  citations  to  specific  
parts  of  the  Century  Code  are  available  at  
www.ndcourts.gov/ndlshc by clicking on the Rules 
and Laws link. 

Volume 14 is the General Index to the North Dakota 
Century  Code.  The  General  Index  is  a  very  useful 
reference  resource  but  it  is  only  available  with  the 
print version of the Century Code.

Pocket Parts

Volumes 1A through 12 of the North Dakota Century 
Code  are  not  reprinted  after  every  Legislative 
Session or every time the Supreme Court interprets 
the  Century  Code  in  a  court  opinion.  Instead,  a 
supplement  is  printed  and  tucked  into  the  back 
cover.  This  is  called  a  pocket  part  or  a  pocket 
supplement.

A  patron  should  always  check  the  pocket  part  for 
any  updates  to  the  laws  and  court  opinions  since 
Volumes 1A through 12 were printed in hardcover.

Dates  of  Enactment  and  Amendment  (Source 
section)

Directly  following  the  text  of  each  Section  of  the 
Century  Code,  the  Source  section  shows  the  date 
the law was enacted and any amendment dates.

Case Law (Notes to Decisions section)

When a North Dakota state district court interprets 
what  a  law  within  North  Dakota  Century  Code 
means,  and  that  decision  is  appealed,  the  North 
Dakota  Supreme  Court  reviews  the  district  court 
decision.  Then,  the  Supreme  Court  writes  their 
opinion  to  explain  how  and  why  they  interpreted 
the law to decide the appeal the way they did. The 
opinions  are  case  law  and  are  followed  by  North 
Dakota state courts deciding later cases with similar 
facts and issues. 

THE  NORTH  DAKOTA  CENTURY  CODE  PRINT 
RESEARCH RESOURCE:

The North Dakota Century Code is available in print 
in  Volumes  1A  through  12  of  the  North  Dakota 
Century Code.

Case  law  is  a  very  useful  resource  for  researching 
what  a  law  means.  The  North  Dakota  Supreme 
Court regularly interprets what the laws within the 
Century Code mean as part of deciding appeals in 
civil and criminal cases.

JANUARY 2019

If  a  law  within  the  Century  Code  has  related  case 
law, snapshots of the opinions are listed in the Notes 
to Decisions section.

The website includes the current text of the Century 
Code,  but  does  not  include  other  legal  research 
resources like those available in print in Volumes 1A 
through 12 of the North Dakota Century Code.

Secondary Sources (Collateral References & Law 
Reviews sections)

Free Legal Research Websites

Secondary sources of law are written by third parties 
who  discuss,  explain,  or  analyze  laws  within  the 
North Dakota Century Code.  Secondary sources are 
a way for a patron to learn more about a particular 
law in the Century Code.

References  to  secondary  sources  are  listed  in  the 
Collateral References and Law Reviews sections.  If a 
law within the Century Code has related secondary 
sources, they are listed in the Collateral References 
and Law Reviews sections.

The  Corpus  Juris  Secundum  (CJS),  the  American 
Law  Reports  2d  (ALR2d),  and  the  North  Dakota 
in  the 
Law  Review  are  commonly  referenced 
Collateral  References  and  Law  Reviews  sections.  
These  secondary  sources  are  available  in  print  at 
the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library  and 
the  University  of  North  Dakota  Thormodsgard  
Law Library.

THE  NORTH  DAKOTA  CENTURY  CODE  ONLINE 
RESEARCH RESOURCES:

North  Dakota  Century  Code 
research  
resources  are  available  online  from  a  variety  of 
different sources.  Following are a selection of online 
research resources.

North Dakota Legislative Branch Website

The  current  version  of  the  North  Dakota  Century 
Code  is  available  online  at  the  North  Dakota 
Legislative  Branch  website  of  www.legis.nd.gov.  
The website is free to use.

free 

(www.law.cornell.edu)  are 

Justia  (law.justia.com)  and  the  Legal  Information 
Institute 
legal 
research websites.  Legal research resources include 
the North Dakota Century Code and some case law.  
Access to the North Dakota Century Code is either 
the  text  of  the  Century  Code  alone,  or  through  a 
direct link to the Century Code on the North Dakota 
Legislative Branch website.

Subscription Legal Research Websites

(www.versuslaw.com)  and  Fastcase 
VersusLaw 
(www.fastcase.com)  are  legal  research  websites 
with  monthly  subscription  rates.  Legal  research  
resources  include  the  North  Dakota  Century  Code, 
case law and some secondary sources of law, such 
as law reviews.

LexisNexis  (www.lexis.com)  and  Westlaw  (www.
westlaw.com)  provide  access  to  an  extensive  list 
of  legal  research  resources,  including  those  found 
in  Volumes  1A  through  12  of  the  printed  North 
Dakota  Century  Code.    These  websites  tend  to 
be  cost-effective  for  entities  with  many  lawyers.  
Locating free or low-cost access to these websites is 
a challenge for individual researchers.  However, the 
North Dakota Supreme Court Law Library currently 
offers  free  patron  access  to Westlaw.    Patrons  may 
use  Westlaw  on  the  Law  Library  patron  access 
computer  located  at  the  State  Capitol  in  Bismarck.  
Time limits apply based on the number of patrons 
requesting access.

The Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) has designed a grant application for 
small and rural libraries. State Librarian Mary Soucie had the opportunity to participate 
in the conversation around creating this grant package. She encourages our North Dakota 
Libraries  to  consider  submitting  a  grant.  We  know  there  is  a  strong  need  for  support 
amongst  these  libraries  and  we  want  to  thank  IMLS  for  recognizing  the  need.  A  strong 
showing of applications will confirm that this grant opportunity is meeting a need. Please 
contact your Library Development Specialist, Assistant State Librarian Cindy Clairmont-
Schmidt or State Librarian Mary Soucie for assistance with or to read the grant application.
