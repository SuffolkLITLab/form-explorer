Guardianship of a Child (Under 18 Years of Age) 

 
Court employees cannot help you fill out this form.  
Do not include these instructions when you file the completed form. 

Purpose 

When a North Dakota state district court or juvenile court appoints a guardian for a minor child, 

the guardian must complete and file a beginning inventory of the child’s assets with the 

juvenile court.  (A minor child is under 18 years of age.) 

The Beginning Inventory Report gives the juvenile court a summary of the child’s financial 

wellbeing.  It also assists the guardians and conservators (if any) in planning and preserving the 

assets for the child’s future benefit. 

Attach additional pages as necessary to provide a complete inventory with any appropriate 

explanations. 

If new assets are discovered after submitting the Beginning Inventory Report, use your 

judgment to determine if an updated report is required. Otherwise, report these to the juvenile 

court in the annual report along with any new assets acquired.  

Fillable forms are available on the ND Legal Self Help Center website of 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Guardianship and Conservatorship” section.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
