      <pre>Instructions for Motion for Resignation of Guardian  
and Appointment of a Successor Guardian 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you are 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and 
responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If

and appoint a new Guardian to an existing guardianship of an adult.  There’s no guarantee that 
all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The

Purpose 

These forms may be used by a current Guardian to ask the North Dakota State District Court 
that has jurisdiction over the guardianship to resign as Guardian and appoint a Successor 
Guardian. 

A Successor Guardian takes the place of the current Guardian.  When a Successor Guardian is 
appointed by the North Dakota State District Court, the guardianship remains in place with the 
Successor Guardian acting as the Guardian. 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-28-07 relates to resignation of the current Guardian of 
an adult Ward. 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-28-15 relates to appointment of a Successor Guardian 
for an adult Ward. 

If you’re a current Guardian representing yourself, you complete and sign the forms.  If you’re 
unsure how to proceed or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation, consult an 
attorney. 

The Nominated Successor Guardian MUST Complete the Guardian Qualification 
and Training Requirements 

Before completing the forms packet, the person nominated to be appointed Successor 
Guardian MUST complete the Rule 59 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules 
guardian qualification and training requirements. 

The person nominated to be appointed Successor Guardian should review Rule 59 carefully! 

The North Dakota Guardianship Training Course and affidavit forms for the nominated 
Successor Guardian are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Guardians and 
Conservators” section and click on the “Guardianships of Adults” section. 

The affidavit forms and the training course is in the “Rule 59 Guardian Qualifications and 
Training Requirements” section.
