Important! Read Before Using this Packet of Forms. 

ND Legal Self Help staff and court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). If you’re 
unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about finding a 
lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota district court in a guardianship case to hold a hearing at a 
location other than a courthouse, or to allow the person subject to guardianship not to attend 
the hearing. There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through 
the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result 
from the forms or information provided.

You May Use this Packet of Forms if: 

You’re asking to become the guardian of an adult *OR* you’re the current guardian of 
an adult in a North Dakota state district court guardianship case. 

*AND* 

*AND* 

You’ve been notified by the district court that a hearing will be held in the 
guardianship case: 

You want to ask the district court to do one of the following for the benefit of the 
person subject to guardianship: 

1.  Hold the hearing at an alternate location (i.e. nursing home), rather than hold the 

hearing at the courthouse; *OR* 

2.  Allow the person subject to guardianship not to attend the hearing at all. 

You may use this packet of forms to request both options. If you ask for both options, 
you’ll tell the district court which option you prefer. 

Can I Use this Packet of Forms to Ask for the Hearing to be 
Held Remotely or to Appear at a Hearing Electronically? 

No. You can’t use this packet of forms to ask the district court to hold a hearing by remote 
means (reliable electronic means), or to allow you or someone else to appear at a hearing 
remotely (reliable electronic means). 

However, a different set of forms to make these types of requests in a guardianship case is 
available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-guardianship. Scroll to the “Requests Related to 
Appearing at Hearings” section.

allow a person subject to guardianship not to attend the hearing at all, if good cause is shown.

•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If a Non-moving party serves and files a written answer within the deadline: 

The District Court will consider the written answer when deciding whether to approve or deny 
your motion. 

If a Non-moving party DOESN’T serve and file a written answer within the deadline: 

The District Court may consider the lack of a written answer to be an admission by the Non-
moving party that your motion has merit. The Court will decide the motion based on the 
motion documents you served and filed. 

Step 5: The District Court Decides Whether to Grant the Motion. 

After the deadline for serving and filing the written answer has passed, the motion is 
considered to be submitted to the District Court. 

The Judicial Officer assigned to the case reviews the motion documents submitted by you, the 
Moving party, and any Non-moving party to determine if you meet the requirements for 
granting your motion. 

You’ll receive the decision in writing. 

If your motion is granted: 

If the District Court grants your motion, follow the instructions, if any. 

If your motion is denied: 

If the District Court DOESN’T grant your motion, you and the person subject to guardianship 
must attend the hearing in person.
