      <pre>How to Request a Guardian Ad Litem 
in a Guardianship Action 

 

FIRST, ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS: 

1.  Did a North Dakota court appoint a guardian for you? 

2.  Did your guardian ask the court in writing to transfer the North Dakota 

guardianship to a different state? 

3.  Do you want a Guardian Ad Litem (lawyer) to be appointed by the 

court who will support your best interests? 

If you said YES to these questions, this information will help you understand 

how to ask the North Dakota district court to appoint a  

Guardian Ad Litem for you. 

STEPS FOR REQUESTING A GUARDIAN AD LITEM 

Since a North Dakota state district court appointed your guardian, only the North 

Dakota state district court can make changes to your guardianship. 

There has been a written request by your guardian to transfer the guardianship case 

from North Dakota to another state.  The written request is called a petition. 

You have the right to ask the North Dakota State District Court to appoint a Guardian Ad 

Litem to recommend to the court what is best for you. 

A Guardian Ad Litem is a lawyer appointed by a North Dakota District Court to 

recommend (suggest) to the Court what is best for you.  What you want and what is 

best for you may not be the same thing.  The Guardian Ad Litem can only recommend 

what is best for you.

If a Guardian Ad Litem is appointed for you by the court, the Guardian Ad Litem will 

meet with you, listen to your wishes and concerns, talk to other people in your case, and 

make a recommendation (suggestion) to the court about what is best for you. 

Once you receive the request in writing asking to transfer the guardianship from North 

Dakota to another state and you feel you need someone to represent your best 

interests, you should send the written request to appoint a Guardian Ad Litem to the 

North Dakota State District Court.  You only have 14 days from the time you received 

the written request to do this! 

The Court will decide if a Guardian Ad Litem should be appointed for you before a 

decision can be made on the motion to transfer the case out of North Dakota. 

Step One – Write Your Request for Appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem    

When your guardian makes a written request to the North Dakota State District Court to 

transfer your guardianship to a different state, you may request the court appoint a 

Guardian Ad Litem to recommend (suggest) to the court what is best for you. 

Write your request for a Guardian Ad Litem soon! 

You only have 14 days from the day you got copies of your guardian’s request!   

If you don’t know which North Dakota state district court is in charge of your 

guardianship, look on the first page of the request documents your guardian gave you. 

The name of the district court and your case number are on the top of the first page. 

You can hand-write or type your answer. 

If you hand-write your answer, make sure you write your words neatly, so your words 

are easy to read. 

Use a pen that has blue or black ink.  Do not use a pencil.

You may use the form at the end of these instructions to write your request. 

•  Caption:  Fill in the top part (caption). (You can get this information by looking at 

the top of the guardian’s request documents): 

o  Type or write the county; 

o  Type or write the judicial district; 

o  Type or write your name as it is on the guardian’s request papers; 

o  Type or write the case number. 

•  Paragraph number 1:  Type or write your first and last name.

should appoint a Guardian Ad Litem for you.   

o  Explain any concerns you have or why you feel you need a Guardian Ad 
Litem to talk to you and recommend what is in your best interests.   

 

If you do not have enough room, add another sheet of paper.

•  Signature block: 

o  Sign your full name; 

o  Type or write your full name; 

o  Type or write your address;

Step Two – Make a Copy of Your Request; Keep for Your Records    

Make a copy of your request, or have someone you trust make a copy for you. 

Step Three – Take or Mail Your Request to the North Dakota District Court    

You may take your request in-person to the North Dakota State District Court that is in 

charge of your guardianship. 

Or, you may have someone you trust take your request in-person. 

If you or someone you trust can’t get to the court in-person, you may mail your request. 

Here are some ways to find the phone number and address for a North Dakota state 
district court: 

•  Go to www.ndcourts.gov/court-locations and click on the name of the County. 

•  Look for the name of the County in the phone book. 

•  Go to a public library near you and ask how to find the phone number and 

address. 

Step Four – Follow the Instructions from the North Dakota District Court    

Wait one week, if you don’t get something in the mail from the North Dakota State 
District Court, call and ask about your request. 

After you send your request to the North Dakota State District Court, you will get 

information in the mail about your request. 

The information you get in the mail from the North Dakota State District Court will tell 

you if you need to do anything else.

If the North Dakota State District Court decides to appoint a Guardian Ad Litem for 

you, the information you get in the mail will tell you who was appointed your 

Guardian Ad Litem and how to contact them.   

If the North Dakota State District Court doesn’t appoint a Guardian Ad Litem for you, 
you’ll be notified in the mail.  If the North Dakota State District Court doesn’t appoint a 
guardian ad litem for you, you can choose to hire a lawyer to represent your wishes.  

Please know that you do NOT need an attorney.
