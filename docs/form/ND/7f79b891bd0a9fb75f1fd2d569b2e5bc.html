marriage has not been annulled or dissolved, is illegal and void from the beginning unless such 
former husband or wife was absent and believed by such person to be dead for a period of five 
years immediately preceding such marriage.

the combination surname is the premarriage surname or former surname of either 
spouse.

constitutes   proof   that   the   use   of   the   new   surname,   or   the   retention   of   the   former 
surname, is lawful.

5. Neither the use of nor the failure to use the option of selecting a new surname by 
means of a marriage license application, as provided in subsection 3, abrogates the 
right of either party to adopt a different surname through usage at a future date.
