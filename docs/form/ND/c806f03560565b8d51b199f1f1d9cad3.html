      <pre>RELOCATING OUT OF STATE WITH CHILDREN 

A Research Guide for a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides informational resources to people who 
represent themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide IS NOT a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your research into relocating out of North Dakota 
with your children.  The information provided in this research guide is not intended for legal 
advice and cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

(Primary residential responsibility means a parent with more than 50% of the residential 
responsibility.  Please note that in 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term 
“custody” to “residential responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

OVERVIEW OF RELOCATING OUT OF STATE WITH CHILDREN: 

When a parent granted primary residential responsibility by a North Dakota state district 
court wishes to relocate the residence of their children out of the state of North Dakota, that 
parent must have 1) the consent of the other parent (if the other parent was granted parenting 
time); or 2) an order from a North Dakota state district court. 

An order of a North Dakota state district court is not required if 1) the other parent has 
not exercised parenting time for one year; or 2) has moved to another state and is more 
than 50 miles from the parent with primary residential responsibility. 

When a parent granted equal residential responsibility by a North Dakota state district court 
wishes to relocate the residence of their children out of the state of North Dakota, that parent 
must have 1) the consent of the other parent; or 2) an order from a North Dakota state district 
court allowing the move and awarding the relocating parent primary residential responsibility. 

Relocation when primary residential responsibility is not already established in the North 
Dakota state district court order:  When the parent who wants to relocate with the children 
does not already have primary residential responsibility granted in the order (i.e. equal or joint 
is ordered), that parent may first be required to prove to the court that they should be granted 
primary residential responsibility.

Relocation when residential responsibility is granted by a Non-North Dakota state court, such 
the court of another state, or a tribal court:  Contact the court of the state or tribe that 
granted residential responsibility.   

Relocation when no residential responsibility case has been started, or has been granted by a 
North Dakota state district court, a court of another state, or a tribal court: You will need to 
research your legal rights and responsibilities related to relocating children out of North Dakota 
when no court has established residential responsibility and parenting time between the 
parents. 

NORTH DAKOTA STATUTES RELATED TO RELOCATING OUT OF STATE WITH 
CHILDREN: 
(North Dakota statutes are found in the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC).  The North Dakota 
Century Code contains the laws enacted by North Dakota Legislature.  The NDCC is found online 
at www.legis.nd.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code.  **These are not the full 
chapters and sections contained in the NDCC, please follow the links to view the laws in full.**) 

Chapter 14-09  

Parent and Child 

www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c09.html 

•  See specifically, Section 14-09-07: Residence of child, for relocation requirements. 

•  See also, Section 14-09-06.2: Best interests and welfare of child – Court considerations – 

Factors. 

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW RELATED TO RELOCATING OUT OF STATE WITH 
CHILDREN: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to NDCC Section 14-09-07, is to use the print version of 
the North Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each Section of 
the Century Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the 
Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, hover over 
the “Supreme Court” drop down menu.  Then, click on the “Opinions” link and enter the case 
name or case citation.

Review the North Dakota Supreme Court opinions related to NDCC Section 14-09-07.  The 
opinions include additional factors the district court must consider when you request to change 
the residence of a child out of state.  The factors are called the Stout-Hawkinson test.  

The four factors of the Stout-Hawkinson test are: 

1.  Prospective advantages of the move in improving the custodial parent's and the child's 

quality of life; 

2.  Integrity of the custodial parent's motive for relocation, considering whether the motive 

is to defeat or deter visitation by noncustodial parent; 

3.  Integrity of the noncustodial parent's motives for opposing the move; and 
4.  Potential negative impact on the relationship between the noncustodial parent and the 
child, including whether there is a realistic opportunity for visitation which can provide 
an adequate basis for preserving and fostering the noncustodial parent's relationship 
with the child if relocation is allowed, and likelihood that each parent will comply with 
such alternate visitation. 

Another way to research case law related to relocating the residence of a child out of state, is 
to search by topic at www.ndcourts.gov.  Hover over the “Supreme Court” drop down menu 
and click on the “Opinions” link.  Click on the “By Topic” drop down menu, and the on the link 
for “Child Cust. & Support (Div./Other).” 

NORTH DAKOTA COURT RULES RELATED TO RELOCATING OUT OF STATE WITH 
CHILDREN: 
(Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is conducted.  All 
of the court rules are found online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.  **These are not 
the full rules contained in the North Dakota court rules, please follow the links to view the rules 
in full.**)

Limited Legal Representation 

Attorneys licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an 
attorney can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the 
part of the case the attorney handled.  For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
