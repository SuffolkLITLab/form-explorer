What Definitions Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet of Forms? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they’re NOT intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Guardian (or Co-Guardians) – An individual or nonprofit corporation appointed by a North 
Dakota state district court to make personal decisions for the Ward. 

Interested Person – Includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any 
others having a property right in, or claim against, a trust estate or the estate of a Ward.  
Interested persons are usually listed in the findings and order appointing the Guardian(s). 

Judicial Referee – A judicial officer, appointed by the presiding District Court judge, who has the 
authority to preside in District Court guardianship proceedings.  The findings and order of the 
judicial referee have the effect of the findings and order of a District Court judge until 
superseded by a written order of a District Court judge. 

Motion – A written request to a North Dakota state district court to issue an order for a specific 
purpose.  For example, a written request for an order authorizing the Guardian to sell the 
Ward’s real property. 

Moving Party – The Guardian making the motion. 

Objecting Party – The Ward’s spouse or any Interested Person who objects to the motion in 
writing within 10 days of being served the motion.  Also referred to as the Opposing Party. 

Real Property – land either with or without buildings on it. For example, a home is real 
property.  Also generally referred to as real estate. 

Ward – An adult individual for whom a North Dakota state district court appointed a guardian. 

A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide Your Motion 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows adult guardianship 
cases in District Court to be heard and decided by a judicial referee, rather than a District Court 
judge. 

If a judicial referee is assigned to the guardianship case, any party to the case may request that 
a District Court judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

[Page 4 of 19] 

MP Instructions/Rev May 2022 

If the guardianship case is heard and decided by a judicial referee, the judicial referee will issue 
findings of fact and an order.  The judicial referee’s findings of fact and order have the same 
effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court judge until superseded (replaced) by a 
written order of a District Court judge. 

If any party to the guardianship case wants a review of the judicial referee’s findings of fact and 
order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for the 
review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review. 

The party requesting the review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

resources/rules/ndrcivp/6. 

If your deadline is stated in days: 

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the deadline. 

o  For example, if service of a motion starts the deadline, don’t include the date 

you were served the motion. 

•  Count every day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and North Dakota state holidays. 
• 

Include the last day of the deadline, but if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or 
North Dakota state holiday, the deadline continues to run until the end of the next day 
that isn’t a Saturday, Sunday, or North Dakota state holiday. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

[Page 16 of 19] 

MP Instructions/Rev May 2022 

o  For example, if the last day of the deadline lands on a Sunday, the deadline 

extends until the end of the next day, which is Monday. 

STEP SIX(a): If No Written Objections are Served and Filed Within the 10 or 13 
Day Deadline, the District Court MAY Make a Decision Based Only on the 
Documents Filed 

If No One Opposes the Motion in Writing within the Deadline: 

The judge or judicial referee may make a decision on your motion without holding a hearing. 

However, the judge or judicial referee may decide a hearing is necessary before making a 
decision on your motion. 

If a hearing is scheduled, you’ll receive notice of the date, time, and location. 

STEP SIX(a): If Written Objections are Served and Filed Within the 10 or 13 Day 
Deadline, OR the District Court Decides a Hearing is Necessary, a Hearing is Held 
Before the District Court Makes a Decision 

Prepare your case for the evidentiary hearing. 

Be prepared to prove everything you typed or wrote in your motion documents. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Subpoenas: Review Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully!  If you 
require a witness to appear at the hearing or require production of documents, electronically 
stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District Court to issue a 
subpoena.  Only a Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

More information about subpoenas is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/subpoenas. 

Evidence: You’re required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your 
own evidence and when objecting to the evidence presented by other parties. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

You may also wish to review the guides for self-represented individuals for gathering and 
presenting evidence at rcdvcpc.org/resources/self-represented-litigants-series.html. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

[Page 17 of 19] 

MP Instructions/Rev May 2022 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library 
near you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask library staff of your local North 
Dakota library how to request the book. 

If the Hearing will be Held in Person, Attend the Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a set of forms is available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

If your hearing is in-person at the courthouse, arrive early so you don’t miss your hearing date 
and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to court on the date and time 
scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

If the Hearing will by Held by Zoom, Make Sure You Can Connect to the Zoom Hearing: 

If your hearing is held electronically by Zoom, well before the hearing begins, make sure you 
can connect and understand how to function in Zoom. 

Don’t be late to the Zoom hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t attend 
the hearing on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge, or judicial referee, hears both sides and then issues the findings of fact and order.  
Sometimes, the findings of fact and order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the 
findings of fact and order is issued at a later date. 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

goes first. 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Moving Party (Guardian) 

•  Moving Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Moving Party presents their case first. The Objecting Party may cross-

examine witnesses and object to the Moving Party’s evidence. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

[Page 18 of 19] 

MP Instructions/Rev May 2022 

•  Objecting Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Objecting Party presents their case after the Moving Party.  The Moving 

Party may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Objecting Party’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

Before You Leave the Hearing:  

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Objecting Party goes first. 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP SEVEN: Findings of Fact and Order is Issued by the District Court 

Until the judge or judicial referee signs an order authorizing the sale of the Ward’s real 
property, you can’t sell the property. 

If no hearing is held, after reviewing the documents filed with the court the judge or judicial 
referee will make a decision and issue findings of fact and an order. 

If a hearing is held, the judge or judicial referee will make a decision after the hearing and after 
reviewing the documents filed with the court.  The judge or judicial referee will then issue 
findings of fact and an order. 

You’ll receive a copy of the Findings of Fact and Order signed and dated by the judge or judicial 
referee by mail or email. 

The judge or judicial referee may order any of the following: 

•  Authorize the sale with the terms and conditions requested by you, the Guardian; 
•  Authorize the sale and add additional terms and conditions you must meet; OR 
•  Dismiss the motion entirely and not authorize the sale. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
