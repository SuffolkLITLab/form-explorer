A Research Guide for a North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide ISN’T a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your research into establishing paternity 
(paternity adjudication) in North Dakota state district courts.  This information isn’t intended 
for legal advice and can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed to practice law 
in the state of North Dakota. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references doesn’t mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk.

NO PATERNITY ADJUDICATION FORMS AVAILABLE 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center and the North Dakota Court System don’t have forms 
or instructions available specifically for asking a North Dakota state court for establishing 
paternity (paternity adjudication). 

If you represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer 
to do so. 

The basic steps in the process to ask a North Dakota state district court to establish paternity 
(paternity adjudication) start on Page 9.  The steps include the names and general descriptions 
of many of the legal documents you’ll need to create and prepare. 

If you’re interested in finding an attorney to represent you, go to Page 22 for all of the 
attorney resources available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

SECTION ONE: 
OVERVIEW OF PATERNITY ADJUDICATION 

What is meant by paternity adjudication?   

Paternity adjudication means the petitioner is asking the ND State District Court to establish 
paternity (who is the father of the child). 

What is meant by paternity rescission?   

Paternity rescission in a North Dakota State District Court means the petitioner is an individual 
who signed the Acknowledgement of Paternity form and wants to cancel or challenge the 
Acknowledgment of Paternity. 

NOTE:  This research guide DOESN’T include information about the paternity 

rescission process. 

How is paternity established? 

According to North Dakota Century Code Section 14-20-07(2), “The father-child relationship is 
established between a man and a child by: 

1.  An unrebutted presumption of the man’s paternity of the child under section 14-20-10; 

(www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c20.pdf#nameddest=14-20-10) 

2.  An effective acknowledgment of paternity by the man under sections 14-20-11 through 
14-20-24, unless the acknowledgment has been rescinded or successfully challenged; 
(www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c20.pdf#nameddest=14-20-11) 

3.  An adjudication of the man’s paternity; 

4.  Adoption of the child by the man; or 

5.  The man having consented to assisted reproduction by a women under sections 14-20-

59 through 14-20-65 which resulted in the birth of the child.”  

(This space left intentionally blank.)

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

What is an unrebutted presumption of paternity? 

When paternity is presumed (assumed) because of one of the following circumstances, and 
isn’t successfully challenged or disproven, the presumption of paternity is unrebutted. 

According to North Dakota Century Code Section 14-20-10(1), “A man is presumed to be the 
father of a child if: 

1.  He and the mother of the child are married to each other and the child is born during 

the marriage; 

2.  He and the mother of the child were married to each other and the child is born within 

300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, 
divorce, or after a decree of separation;  

3.  Before the birth of the child, he and the mother of the child married each other in 

apparent compliance with law, even if the attempted marriage is or could be declared 
invalid, and the child is born during the invalid marriage or within 300 days after its 
termination by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, divorce, or after a decree of 
separation; 

4.  After the birth of the child, he and the mother of the child married each other in 

apparent compliance with law, whether or not the marriage is or could be declared 
invalid, and he voluntarily asserted his paternity of the child, and: 

a.  The assertion is in a record filed with the state department of health;  
b.  He agreed to be and is named as the child's father on the child's birth certificate; 

or 

c.  He promised in a record to support the child as his own; or  

5.  For the first two years of the child's life, he resided in the same household with the child 

and openly held out the child as his own. 

What is acknowledgment of paternity? 

The North Dakota Acknowledgment of Paternity form allows a biological father to establish 
paternity when he is not married to the mother.  The mother and biological father must both 
sign the form. 

If the mother is married to someone else who is not the father of the child, her spouse must 
also complete the Denial of Paternity section of the form. 

The North Dakota Department of Vital Records has more information about the form.

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

Can a paternity adjudication civil action be started before the child is born? 

Yes, a civil action in North Dakota state district court to establish, or adjudicate, paternity may 
be started before the child is born, but the court can’t make a final decision until after the child 
is born. 

Can the paternity adjudication civil action also establish custody, visitation, or child 
support? 

Yes.  However, the North Dakota state district court can only establish custody, visitation 
and/or child support, AFTER the court has established who the father is. 

Who can bring a paternity action in North Dakota state district court? 

North Dakota Century Code Section 14-20-37 allows the following to bring a paternity action in 
North Dakota state district court: 

•  “The child; 
•  The mother of the child; 
•  A man whose paternity of the child is to be adjudicated; 
•  The support enforcement agency; 
•  An authorized adoption agency or licensed child-placing agency; or 
•  A representative authorized by law to act for an individual who would otherwise be 
entitled to maintain a proceeding but who is deceased, incapacitated, or a minor.” 

What is the deadline for bringing a paternity adjudication action? 

If the child doesn’t have a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated father: 

•  An action to adjudicate paternity may be brought at any time. 

o  However, if the child is 18 years old or older, the child must bring the action. 

If the child has a presumed father: 

•  An action to adjudicate paternity must be brought no later than two years after the 

birth of the child. 

•  However, an action seeking to disprove the father-child relationship between the 

presumed father and the child may be brought at any time if the petitioner proves: 

o  The presumed father and the mother of the child neither cohabited nor engaged 
in sexual intercourse with each other during the probable time of conception; 
and 

o  The presumed father never openly held out the child as his own. 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 4 of 22 

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

If the child already has an adjudicated father: 

•  Only an individual who wasn’t a party in in the original paternity adjudication case can 

bring their own paternity adjudication action.  The action must be brought no later than 
two years after the effective date of the paternity adjudication. 

What is the deadline for bringing a paternity rescission action? 

NOTE:  This research guide DOESN’T include information about the paternity 

rescission process. 

The child has an acknowledged father: 

•  A paternity rescission action may be brought by one of the individuals who signed the 
acknowledgement of paternity or denial of paternity.  The action must be brought no 
later than the earlier of: 

o  60 days after the effective date of the acknowledgment or denial, as provided in 

North Dakota Century Code Section 14-20-14; or 

o  The date of the first hearing, in a proceeding to which the signatory is a party, 

before a court to adjudicate an issue relating to the child, including a proceeding 
that establishes support. 

•  After the expiration date, an individual who signed the acknowledgement of paternity 

or denial of paternity may bring a paternity rescission action to challenge the 
acknowledgement or denial only: 

o  On the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact; and 
o  Within 2 years after the acknowledgment or denial is filed with the state 

department of health.   

What is the North Dakota county (venue) where the paternity adjudication action is 
filed? 

Venue is the North Dakota county where the action to adjudicate paternity will be filed. 

An action to adjudicate paternity is filed in the North Dakota state district court of: 

•  The North Dakota county where the child resides or is found; 

• 

If the child doesn’t reside in North Dakota, the North Dakota county where the 
respondent resides or is found (the individual who isn’t starting the paternity action); or 

•  The county where a proceeding for probate or administration of the presumed or 

alleged father's estate has been started.

PATERNITY ADJUDICATION LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES 

NORTH DAKOTA STATUTES: 

(North Dakota statutes are found in the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC).  The North Dakota 
Century Code contains the laws enacted by the North Dakota Legislature.  The NDCC is found at 
www.legis.nd.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code.) 

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 14-20 - Uniform Parentage Act 
(www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c20.html) 

•  See Section 14-20-10 for presumption of paternity.  If paternity is established under this 

Section, you will need a court to order a change in paternity.  

•  See Section 14-20-36 for the start of the requirements for asking a court to adjudicate 

paternity. 

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 23-02.1 - relates to birth certificates 
(www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t23c02-1.html). 

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 

(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to paternity adjudication is to use the print version of the 
North Dakota Century Code to locate the short summaries of case law after each Section.  Case 
law summaries directly follow the text of the Century Code Section. 

•  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme 

Court Opinions” link and enter the case name or case citation. 

You may also research case law by topic at www.ndcourts.gov.

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

See Page 21 for information about General-Use template forms available on the North Dakota 
Legal Self Help Center webpage that may be of interest as a starting point for creating legal 
documents. 

STEP 2: THE PETITIONER SERVES COPIES OF THE PATERNITY ADJUDICATION 
DOCUMENTS ON EACH RESPONDENT  

Service of copies of the following completed documents starts the paternity adjudication 
action:

•  Petition to Adjudicate Paternity; and 
•  Any supporting documentation (other affidavits, exhibits, etc). 

The Petitioner must arrange to have a copy of the completed summons, petition, and any 
supporting documents served on each Respondent.  The Petitioner is responsible for serving 
(giving) copies of the documents they intend to file with the district court. 

The Petitioner must review North Dakota Century Code Chapter section 14-20 to determine 
who must be served and what documents must be served.  Words such as “notice” and 
“service” indicate when service is required. 

Instructions and forms for service to start a civil action are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

•  See the “Service to Start a Civil Action” section. 

The Petitioner must have proof of service showing that each Respondent was served a copy 
of the completed documents. 

CAUTION:  If the Petitioner doesn’t file proof of service with the district court, the court won’t 

act on their petition. 

•  A completed and signed affidavit of service from the person who served the documents 

is the Petitioner’s proof of service.

of court.  Contact information for clerks of court by county is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/court-locations.

THE RESPONDENT RESPONDS TO THE PETITION; THE PETITIONER MAY RESPOND 
WITH AN ANSWER TO THE COUNTER-PETITION; GENETIC TESTING MAY BE 
REQUESTED 

STEP 1: THE RESPONDENT HAS 21 DAYS TO RESPOND TO THE PETITION  

The Respondent has twenty-one (21) days after service to respond to or “answer” the petition.  
An answer is a formal, written response by a respondent to a petition to adjudicate paternity.   

The Respondent may include a “Counter-Petition” in their answer.  A counter-petition is a 
written demand or request to the state district court for judgment granting the relief the 
Respondent is seeking.  A counter-petition allows the Respondent to bring their own claims. 

• 

If a Respondent is served by publication, that Respondent has fifteen (15) days after the 
first publication of the summons in the newspaper to respond or “answer” the petition. 

NOTE:  If the Respondent doesn’t serve and file an Answer or Answer and Counter-Petition, the 

court may consider the failure to respond an admission that the petition has merit.  The 
Petitioner is still required to prove they meet the requirements of the laws or rules that apply 
to the petition.

H.pdf). 

See Page 21 for information about General-Use template forms available on the North Dakota 
Legal Self Help Center webpage that may be of interest as a starting point for creating legal 
documents.  

STEP 2:   THE RESPONDENT SERVES COPIES OF THE DOCUMENTS ANSWERING THE 
PATERNITY ADJUDICATION ACTION  

Service of copies of the following completed documents meets the twenty-one (21) day 
deadline for answering the paternity adjudication summons and complaint: 

•  Answer or Answer and Counter-Petition; and 
•  Any supporting documentation (other affidavits, exhibits, etc). 

The Respondent must arrange to have a copy of the completed answer (or answer and 
counter-petition), and any supporting documents served on each Petitioner.  The Respondent 
is responsible for serving (giving) copies of the documents they intend to file with the district 
court. 

The Respondent must review North Dakota Century Code Chapter section 14-20 to determine 
who must be served and what documents must be served.  Words such as “notice” and 
“service” indicate when service is required. 

Instructions and forms for service after a civil action has started are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

•  See the “Service after a District Court Civil Action Has Started” section. 

 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 14 of 22 

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

The Respondent must have proof of service showing that each Petitioner was served a copy 
of the completed documents. 

CAUTION:  If the Respondent doesn’t file proof of service with the district court, the court 

won’t act on their answer (or answer and counter-petition). 

•  A completed and signed affidavit of service from the person who served the documents 

is the Respondent’s proof of service. 

STEP 3:   THE RESPONDENT FILES THE ORIGINAL, COMPLETED ANSWER OR ANSWER 
AND COUNTER-PETITION TO THE PATERNTIY ADJUDICATION ACTION DOCUMENTS 

The originals of the completed paternity adjudication Answer or Answer and Counter-Petition 
documents and the document(s) showing proof of service must be filed with the clerk: 

•  Answer; or  Answer and Counter-Petition; 
•  Other supporting documents (other affidavits, exhibits, etc); 
•  Proof of Service; and 
•  Confidential Information Form (only if needed – please see above instructions). 

NOTE:   IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU KEEP A COPY OF ALL DOCUMENTS FOR YOUR RECORDS!  

The Respondent will be required to pay a $50.00 filing fee.  Confirm the amount with the clerk 
of court.  Contact information for clerks of court by county is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

Forms and instructions for requesting the court waive the filing fee are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. 

STEP 4 (OPTIONAL):  THE PETITIONER MAY PREPARE, SERVE, AND FILE AN ANSWER TO 
THE COUNTER-PETITION 

If a Respondent’s answer includes a counter-petition, the Petitioner may prepare, serve, and 
file an answer to the counter-petition. 

An answer to a counter-petition is a written response by a Petitioner to Respondent’s counter-
petition.  The answer to counter-petition must also state defenses to each of the Respondent’s 
counterclaims in short, plain statements. 

See Page 21 for information about General-Use template forms available on the North Dakota 
Legal Self Help Center webpage that may be of interest as a starting point for creating legal 
documents.

The Petitioner arranges to have a copy of the answer to counter-petition served on the 
Respondent.   

Instructions and forms for service after a civil action has started are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

•  See the “Service after a District Court Civil Action Has Started” section. 

The Petitioner files the original answer to counter-claim with the clerk of court. 

The Petitioner must file the original of the completed Answer to Counter-Petition document 
and the document(s) showing proof of service with the clerk. 

Since this is a part of the original action, the Petitioner will not be required to pay another filing 
fee. 

STEP 5:  GENETIC TESTING MAY BE REQUESTED 

As part of a paternity adjudication action, genetic testing may be requested.  The process for 
requesting genetic testing is made in a motion. 

For general information about the motion process in North Dakota civil court actions, go to 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/making-a-motion. 

Carefully review the information and resources! 

NOTE:  North Dakota state district courts are not allowed to order the genetic testing of an 

unborn child. 

THE COURT HEARING 

PREPARE FOR THE HEARING 

The Petitioner must prove the allegations in the petition and the grounds (reasons) to 
adjudicate paternity.  The Respondent may present evidence to disprove the Petitioner’s 
allegations and proof. 

CAUTION!!   Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. 

You’re held to same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand 
the rules or procedures. You’ll need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 16 of 22 

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

At minimum, you’ll need to review and research the laws and rules listed in Section Two above.  
The North Dakota Rules of Evidence, in particular, are used to present and object to evidence. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

Organize the information, documents, etc., that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At a 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

BOTH PARTIES MUST ATTEND THE HEARING(S) 

REMEMBER: 

• 

• 

If the Petitioner doesn’t attend the hearing, their petition may be dismissed. 

If the Respondent doesn’t attend the hearing, the judge or judicial referee may think 
they are admitting to the allegations in the petition. 

If a party, or a party’s witness, can’t appear in person, they can ask the court for permission to 
attend a hearing by telephone or by some other reliable electronic means. 

•  NOTE:  The court is not required to grant this type of request. 

The Appear by Phone or Other Electronic Means form set is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Miscellaneous” section. 

There may be more than one hearing, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.  Be 
prepared for every hearing. 

**Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Don’t miss the hearing date and time.  If a party has a have a serious, unavoidable reason they 
can’t get to court on the date and time scheduled for hearing, they must call the courthouse as 
soon as they can. 

NOTE:  Even if a party calls the courthouse, the court may still decide to hold the hearing at the 

scheduled time and date.

CONDUCT OF THE HEARING:  

The judge hears both sides and then decides whether to issue a Judgment regarding the court’s 
findings.  Sometimes, the Judgment is issued at the end of the hearing.  Sometimes, the 
Judgment is issued at a later date.  

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Petitioner go first. 

•  The Petitioner Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Petitioner presents their case first. 
o  The Respondent may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Petitioner’s 

evidence. 

•  The Respondent Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Respondent presents their case after the moving party. 
o  The Petitioner may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Respondent’s 

evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Respondent goes first. 

The judge of the district court will decide if the Petitioner proved the petition.  If the judge 
decides the Petitioner proved the petition, a Judgment will be issued. 

IF THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT ESTABLISHES PATERNITY:  

If the North Dakota state district court establishes paternity of the child, the order may also 
contain any of the following: 

•  Payment of child support; 
•  Payment of expenses of the mother's pregnancy; 
•  Custody of the child; 
•  Visitation with the child; 
•  Furnishing of bond or other security for payment of support.

THE COURT MAY REQUIRE THE PETITIONER AND/OR RESPONDENT TO PREPARE, 
SERVE, AND FILE A PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND 
ORDER FOR JUDGMENT AND A PROPOSED JUDGMENT 

The judge may require one or more parties to prepare, serve, and file the following: 

•  Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment; and 
•  Proposed Judgment. 

STEP 1: PREPARE THE PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND 
ORDER FOR JUDGMENT  

Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment 

See Rule 52 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota Rules 
of Court. 

Findings of fact are the judge’s written determination of the facts made from the evidence 
presented.  This explains what facts the judge found to be true. 

Conclusions of law are the rulings of law made by the judge based on, or in connection with, 
the findings of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the judge found to be true. 

STEP 2: PREPARE THE PROPOSED JUDGMENT  

Review Rule 54 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court. 

The judgment is the written order of the judge’s final decision.  The judgment is the same as the 
Conclusions of Law from Step 1. 

STEP 3:  SERVE THE PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND 
ORDER FOR JUDGMENT AND PROPOSED JUDGMENT UPON ALL PARTIES  

The proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment, and the proposed 
judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of service filed with the Clerk of District 
Court. 

For information about service after a civil action has been started, go to the “District Court 
Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

•  See the “Service after a District Court Civil Action Has Started” section. 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 19 of 22 

Paternity Adjudication/Jun 2020 

STEP 4:  THE JUDGE WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND ORDER FOR JUDGMENT, AND THE PROPOSED JUDGMENT 
ARE APPROPRIATE  

The judge will decide whether the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for 
judgment, and proposed judgment are appropriate.  If the judge decides they are appropriate, 
the judge will sign and date the findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment and 
judgment.   

CAUTION!!  The findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment, and the judgment 

aren’t official until the findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment are signed 
and dated by the judge. 

STEP 5:  IF ORDERED TO DO SO, PREPARE THE NOTICE OF ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND 
SERVE THE NOTICE OF ENTRY OF JUDGMENT ALONG WITH A COPY OF THE JUDGMENT 
UPON ALL PARTIES 

See Rule 58 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Within 14 days after the judgment is entered, the prevailing parent must serve notice of entry 
of judgment on the other party or parties.  A copy of the judgment must be included with the 
notice of entry of judgment. 

The following form is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Notice of Entry of Judgment form 

NOTE:  After service is complete, the prevailing party must file the original, completed Notice of 

Entry of Judgment and proof of service on the other party or parties with the Clerk of District 
Court.

SECTION FOUR: 
GENERAL-USE TEMPLATE FORMS 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions available for 
actions to establish, or adjudicate, paternity. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own legal documents, or retain 
an attorney to do so.  

Although the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions for motions for an 
order to show cause, the General-Use forms to starting a district court civil action are available 
at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

• 

• 

If you are the Petitioner, you may find the General-Use forms to starting a district court 
civil action template forms available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/starting-a-
civil-action useful as a starting point for creating your own summons and petitioner. 

If you are the Respondent, you may find the General-Use forms for answering a district 
civil court civil action template forms available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/answering-a-civil-action useful as a starting point for creating your own answer and 
counterclaim.  

Legal Services of North Dakota created a Family Law Manual for lawyers.  The Family Law 
Manual is available at www.legalassist.org/?id=128&page=ND+Family+Law+Manual.  There are 
examples of documents available in the "Paternity Action" section.  You may find the examples 
of interest for general formatting purposes.    

(The reference to the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual is for formatting only.  
Including this reference doesn’t mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the Family Law Manual.  Use at your own risk.)  

You’re responsible for the information on the documents you file with the court. 

If you’d like assistance creating your legal documents, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota.  

Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to practice in North 
Dakota may agree to help you with part of your civil action, such as preparing legal documents, 
while you handle the rest of the action. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
