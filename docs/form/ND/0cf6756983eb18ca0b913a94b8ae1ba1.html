INFORMATION

Form 1

IMPORTANT:  To Protect Your Rights read carefully this information, and any instructions to which you are referred.

Small  Claims  Court  is  a  division  of  district  court  where  cases  may  be  heard  that  involve  recovery  of  money  or
cancellation of any agreement involving material fraud, deception, misrepresentation, or false promise.  The Small
Claims Court was established so citizens could present their own cases to the court without the assistance of an attorney.

Claims may be filed in Small Claims Court if:

The amount claimed does not exceed $15,000, and

No more than six years has elapsed since the date of the debt or date of the last payment.
(This time period may vary under certain circumstances.)

In Small Claims Court you:

Need NOT hire an attorney.  (The judge will assist both parties in presenting their case.)

Do not have the right to trial by jury.

Do not have the right to appeal the decision of the judge.

You may elect to have your case heard in district court in which case you:

May find it necessary to hire an attorney.

May have the right to a trial by jury.

Have the right to appeal the decision of the judge.

If a claim is filed in Small Claims Court:

The Plaintiff may not change his or her mind and have the case moved to District Court.

The Defendant may have the case heard in Small Claims Court, or have the case moved to
District Court by filing the REMOVAL TO DISTRICT COURT (Form 3) within 20 days of
receipt of the Claim Affidavit and serving a copy of Form 3 on the Plaintiff.  See Instructions
for Form 3 for additional filing and fee requirements.  NOTE: If the Defendant elects to

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Only the Court can change the time of the hearing.
Request for a change must be made to the Small Claims Division of the District Court.

Even if you get a judgement in your favor (you win), you might not get your money!
(If a person is unemployed, does not have any property of sufficient value, or is on some type of
assistance, it may be impossible to collect.)

Take to the hearing all receipts and evidence related to the case and any witnesses that you wish to

have testify on your behalf.

Keep track of all your costs related to the case (such as cost of serving papers).

If you win, the judge may order the losing party to pay your costs.

The judgment debtor (the losing party) has 30 days from the date of Notice of Entry of Judgment in
which to pay the judgment sum.  Failure to do so means the judgment creditor (the winning party) may

start collection proceedings through the Sheriff.

27-08.1-01. Small claims court - Jurisdictional limits - Venue.
1. All judges of the district courts may exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this chapter, and while sitting in the

exercise of that jurisdiction must be known and referred to as the "small claims court". The jurisdiction of this court is
confined to cases for recovery of money, or the cancellation of any agreement involving material fraud, deception,
misrepresentation, or false promise, where the value of the agreement or the amount claimed by the plaintiff or the
defendant does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars.
2. The proceedings in this court must be commenced:

If the claim is for collection of a check written without sufficient funds or without an account, in the county where
the check was passed, or in the county of the defendant's residence or place of business.
If the defendant is an individual and the claim is for collection of an open account on which credit has been

place of business.

If the defendant is an individual and  the claim is not made under subdivision b or c, in the county of the
defendant's residence.
If the defendant is an individual and the claim arose as the result of the defendant's lease of real property or as
the result of a dispute over disposition of earnest money or other money deposit arising from a contract to purchase
real property, in the county where the real property is located unless the plaintiff and the defendant consent in
writing to a proceeding in a different county.
If the plaintiff is a political subdivision and the claim is for a public utility debt, in the county in which the
political subdivision is located.

3. Except for an action under subdivision c, e, or f of subsection 2, the defendant may elect to remove the action to a
small claims court in the defendant's county of residence. A claim may not be filed by an assignee of that claim. A
garnishment or attachment may not issue from this court until after judgment is entered.

27-08.1-02.  C ommencement  o f  action  -  C laim  a ffidavit.  Actions  in  the  small  cl aims  court  are  commenced 

whenever any per son executes  and files with  th e court a claim affidavit, and causes the af fidavit to b e served by a 
person of legal age, not a party to or interested 
in the action, on the defendant or mails it to  the defendant by cer tified 
mail with  restricted delivery along with a form upon which the  defendant must indicate whether a hearin g is requested 
and whether the defendant elects to remov e the action to district court. If, within  twenty days of serv ice o f the affidavit 
and form, the cour t has not received  a r equest for  a  hearing  or  an  election  to  remove 
to  district co urt, or  if the 
defendant ind icates that a  hearing  is  n ot r equested, a hearing will not be scheduled and judgment may be en tered 
against the defendant by default. If the defendant  requests a hearing in small claims court, the hearing must  be not less 
than ten days and not more than thirty days  after receipt of the request. Except for an action under su bdivision e of 
subsection 2 of section 27-08.1-01, the  mailing or per sonal  service  may  be  made  anywhere  within  the  state. 
Forms  used  in  small  claims  court  actions  must  be  approved  by  the  state  court  administrator and  obtained  from, 
or  at  the  direction  of, the  clerk  of  distr ict  court  or  in electronic form fr om the supreme court.

27-08.1-03. Informal hearing - Answer and counterclaim - Filing and service fees - Examination of debtor. 
No  formal pleadings  other  than  the  claim  affidavit  and  order  for  appearance  may  be  required,  and  the hearing  and 
disposition  of  actions  must  be  informal.  A  court  reporter  is  not  required  to  be  present  to  take  the  testimony  unless 
arranged for and paid for by one of the parties to the action. The defendant may file an answer, and file a claim affidavit 
setting forth any new matter constituting a counterclaim, not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars, which must be served upon 
the plaintiff by a person of legal age not a party to or interested in the action, or mailed to the plaintiff by certified mail, 
not later than forty-eight hours before the hearing set for the appearance of the defendant. The compulsory counterclaim 
rule does not apply to counterclaims in excess of fifteen thousand dollars.  At the hearing, the plaintiff and the defendant may 
appear without counsel. The court will conduct the proceedings and may make its own inquiry before, during, or after 
the hearing. After the court has found that money is owing by any party to the proceeding, the court may, i n the presence 
of the prevailing party, inquire of the debtor as to plans for payment of the debt. The court may examine the debtor

Revised 09/2021

concerning the property owned by the debtor, at the hearing, as would be made under chapter 28-25. The examination
may be made without first having iss ued an execution against the property of the debtor and without further notice as
otherwise provided in chapter 28-25. A trial by jury shall not be allowed in small claims court. A fee as prescribed in
subdivision c of subsection 1 of section 27-05.2-03 must be charged for filing the claim affidavit.

27-08.1-04. Election to proceed in small claims court irrevo cable. Election by the plaintiff to use the procedures
provided for in this chapter is irrevocable. In the event the plaintiff elects to discontinue the proceedings, the court shall
enter its order acc ordingly, and unless otherwise provided in the order the dismissal must be d eemed to be with prejudice.
By election to proceed in small claims court, the plaintiff waives the right to appeal to any other court from the decision
of the small claims court. The defendant waives the right to appeal from the decision of the small claims court upon
receiving the order for appearance as required herein, unless the defendant elects to remove the action from the small
claims court to district court. If the defendant elects to remove the action to district court, the defendant must serve upon
the plaintiff a notice of the removal and file with the clerk of the court to which the action is removed a copy of the claim
affidavit and the defendant's answer along with the filing fee, except for an answer fee, r equired for civil actions.  If the
defendant elects to remove the action from small claims court to district court, the district court shall award attorney's
fees to a prevailing plaintiff.

27-08.1-04.1. Dismissal without prejudice. If the judge determines at any stage of the proceedings that the case
may not be fairly disposed of in small claims court, the judge may dismiss the case without prejudice. A determination
that a case may not be fairly disposed of in small claims court must be based on complexity of factual or legal issues or
a determination that relief other than money damages or cancellation of an agr eement is n ecessary to dispose of the case.
If a case is dismissed under this section, the filing fee must be refunded to the plaintiff. 

27-08.1-05. Judgment. The court shall enter a written judgment indicating its decision on all cases filed with the
court on the basis of the evidence presented. A judgment must be entered even if e ither  party  fails  to appear at the
hearing. The court may award the costs of the action to the prevailing party. For purposes of enforcement and execution,
a judgment of the small claims court has the same force, effects, and attributes of a judgment of the district court.

27-08.1-06. Judgment unsatisfied - Docketing - Execution. Repealed by S.L. 1997, ch. 263, § 5 .

27-08.1-07.  Records  and  destruction  of  records.  Unless  otherwise  authorized  by  rules  of  the  supreme  court,
records of the small claims court consist of all documents filed in each action and an index for pl aintiffs and defendants.
Unless otherwise directed by rules of the supreme court, after the judgment is satisfied or becomes ten years old, the court
may destroy all papers filed in the case, except the judgment. At the time of destroying the papers, the clerk of court shall
make a record upon the judgment identifying the papers destroyed and the dates the papers were filed.

27-08.1-08. Referees of small claims court - Appointment - Term - M ethod of qualifying - Powers and dut ies -
Compensation. The presiding judge of the judicial district may appoint a referee of the small claims court who shall hold
office at the pleasure  of the judge. T he referee shall qualify in the same m anner as other civil officers, except that the
referee need not be a qualified elector of the county, and the duties and powers of the referee in the conduct of trials in
the small claims court are governed by the provisions of rule 53(c), North D akota Rules of Civil Pro cedure, insofar as
those provisions are not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter. The referee appointed must be a person versed
in  the  law.  The  presiding  judge  shall  determine  the  salary  or  fee  of  the  referee,  w ithin  the  limits  of  legislative
appropriations.

The winning party must file proof of service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment and a copy of 
the judgment on each losing party in the Small Claims Court case with the Clerk of Court.  You 
do not provide proof of service on yourself. 

A completed and signed affidavit of service showing service on each party is your proof of 
service.

•  The original, completed Notice of Entry of Judgment form; and 
•  A completed and signed affidavit of service by mail that shows each losing party was 
served a copy of the completed Notice of Entry of Judgment form and a copy of the

Wait 30 days from the date of service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment: 

You must wait 30 days from the date of service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment before you

judgment voluntarily, North Dakota law provides a number of judgment collection options.  
Following are some of the judgment collection options allowed by North Dakota law: 

•  Writ of Execution: A court order to a sheriff to seize non-exempt property of the losing 

•

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
