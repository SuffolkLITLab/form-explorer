Introduction 

North Dakota has adopted the Uniform Probate Code, which allows a person to informally probate a 
Will and have a personal representative appointed without the necessity of a court appearance or a 
court hearing, as long as the proper forms are filed and the correct procedures followed.   

The purpose of this packet is to help North Dakota citizens understand the procedures that must be 
followed and forms that must be filed with regard to the informal probate of a Will and/or the 
appointment of a personal representative of an estate of a deceased citizen. Since each estate has 
different needs, it's important to know the proper methods of managing a particular estate. The 
information in this packet should assist in selecting and filing the correct forms with the court in 
order to informally administer an estate and to have, if needed, a personal representative appointed. 
The necessary probate forms may be purchased from the district court or obtained online at ndcourts.gov 
Checklist of Forms. The North Dakota tax forms are available from the State Tax Commissioner, State 
Capitol, Bismarck. The federal income and estate tax forms are available from your local IRS office and 
on the internet.  

This packet has limitations. It can't and won't address every legal question that could arise in a particular 
estate, nor does it cover all the responsibilities and liabilities of the personal representative and/or the 
heirs, such as the filing of income tax returns. Matters not properly handled could create problems and 
expense for the estate and the heirs if they must be dealt with after the estate is initially closed.  

Therefore, since each estate, no matter how small, can raise many serious legal questions, you're advised 
that you're proceeding at your own risk. The law forbids the district court judge or court personnel to 
give legal advice on how to administer an estate. In legal matters, you should exercise caution and good 
judgment in proceeding without the advice of an attorney.

If, after reviewing this packet, you're unable to determine how or whether to proceed, consult an 
attorney licensed to practice in North Dakota.  

References to N.D.C.C. or in [ ] mean the North Dakota Century Code. The Century Code is available at 
most public and university libraries and at the district court's office in each county.

Handling the Small Estate in North Dakota in Informal Proceedings 

First Step - Listing of Property 

Most of the work required to be done in an estate is the legal and orderly transfer of the decedent's 
property to the persons entitled to receive it. The first step to be taken in any estate is to prepare a list 
(See Fig. A) of all the property owned by the decedent (the person who has died). The value of each 
item is the fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death.  

Figure A: 

The list should identify the amount of any encumbrance (debt or lien) that exists on any item of 
property. [N.D.C.C. 30.1-18-06.] All reasonable steps must be taken for the management and 
protection of the property. [N.D.C.C. 30.1-18-09.]  

(Revised 4/25/2022)

Safe Deposit Box 

A. If a decedent rented a safe deposit box jointly with another person or persons, no court order or 
affidavit is needed for the other person to access the box [N.D.C.C. 30.1-23-05].

B. If a safe deposit box was rented in decedent's name alone, prepare an Affidavit for Access to Safe 
Deposit Box (Form 8) and present signed Affidavit to bank.

C. On the first visit to bank, remove decedent's will. Will is to be filed with the court if the estate needs 
to be probated.

Consult an accountant for the most current information on estate tax. 

Estate Tax  

Income Tax 

Estate income tax returns may be required if the estate had gross income of $600 or more for the tax 
year. Forms and instructions are available from the Internal Revenue Service and State Tax 
Commissioner.  

Non-Probate Property 

A. Real property owned by decedent and others as joint tenants is transferred by filing a certified death
certificate and property description with the county recorder.

B. Other non-probate property interests are transferred or terminated by presenting a death certificate
to the holder.

(Revised 4/25/2022)

Opening and Probating the Estate 

A. Probate Estate $50,000 or Less and No Real Property.

If the total value of the probate property (Fig. A, Columns A and B) less the encumbrances on those 
items of property is $50,000 or under and no real property is involved [N.D.C.C. 30.1-23-01]:  

1. After 30 days have elapsed since decedent's death, prepare Affidavit for Collection of Personal
Property (Form 1).

2. Present Affidavit to holder of the personal property for transfer to successor (person entitled to
receive it).

B. Probate Estate Greater Than $50,000 or Real Property.

If total value of probate property (Fig. A, Columns A and B) less the encumbrances on those items 
of property is over $50,000, or if the probate property includes real property, appoint personal 
representative to administer the estate and distribute decedent's property to the person or 
persons entitled to receive it, as follows:  

1. If decedent left a Will.

Anytime after five days of decedent's death, file with district court: 

a. Application for Informal Probate of Will and Appointment of a Personal Representative
(Form 2).

b. Letters Testamentary (Form 4).

c. Statement of Informal Probate of Will and Appointment of a Personal Representative
(Form 3).

d. Original Will of decedent.

e. Filing fee of $80.

2. If decedent didn't leave a Will, after five days of decedent's death, file with district court:

a. Application for Informal Appointment of Personal Representative in Intestacy (Form 17).

b. Letters of Administration (Form 19).

c. Statement of Informal Appointment of Personal Representative (Form 18).

d. Filing fee of $80.

(Revised 4/25/2022)

C. Priority for appointment as personal representative [N.D.C.C. 30.1-13-03].

1. Person or persons nominated in decedent's Will.

2. Alternate person or persons nominated in decedent's Will.

3. The surviving spouse of the decedent who is entitled to receive property of the decedent under
the decedent's Will.

4. Other persons entitled to receive property of decedent through the decedent's Will.

5. The surviving spouse of the decedent.

6. Other heirs of the decedent.

7. The guardian or conservator of the decedent at the time of the decedent's death.

8. A trust company.

9. Forty-five days after decedent's death, any creditor.

If the person seeking appointment doesn't have highest priority, secure a signed Waiver of 
Appointment (Form 9) from all persons who have a higher or equal right to the appointment. 
File waivers with the district court along with other appointment documents.  

(Revised 4/25/2022)

Duties of Personal Representative 

No bond is required of a personal representative who is administering an estate under the guidelines 
of this packet. However, the personal representative is acting as a trustee of the estate property. If 
the exercise of power concerning the estate is improper, the personal representative is liable to 
interested persons for loss or damage resulting from the improper conduct.  

The duties of a personal representative appear in Chapter 30.1-18 of the North Dakota Century Code. A 
personal representative must keep accurate records of all receipts and disbursements (Form 14). The 
personal representative must keep estate property separate from their own property until the assets 
are distributed. Although the assistance of an attorney isn't required for informal proceedings, the 
personal representative should consult with an attorney if uncertain how to proceed.  

A. Times within which certain steps must be taken.

1. Within 30 days after appointment, prepare Notice and Information to Heirs and Devisees
(Form 5). Send copy to each heir and devisee [N.D.C.C. 30.1-18-05, see also 30.1-14-06].

2. Within six months after appointment or nine months after the death of the decedent, whichever is 
later, prepare the inventory (Form 10). File the original inventory with district court [N.D.C.C.
30.1-18-06]. If the inventory isn't filed with the court, mail a copy of the inventory to each of the heirs 
in an intestate estate or to each of the devisees if a will has been probated, and to any other 
interested persons who request a copy.

3. After appointment, send Affidavit Forwarding Application to Human Services (Form 7), copy of 
application for appointment (Form 2 or 17), and a list of surviving joint tenants to the Department of 
Human Services, State Capitol, Bismarck, ND 58505 [N.D.C.C. 50-06.3-07].

4. Within three months after mailing Notice to Creditors (Form 6) to creditors who are known to the 
Personal Representative and after first publication of Notice to Creditors, or within three years after 
decedent's death if notice to creditors has not been published and mailed, creditors must file any 
claims against the estate [N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-01; N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-03].

5. Within 60 days after the time for original presentation of a claim has expired, if the claim is to be 
disallowed, it must be disallowed in writing or will be deemed to be approved and must then be paid 
[N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-06].

6. Within nine months after decedent's death, if filing requirement exists(1), U.S. Estate Tax Return and 
supporting documents must be filed and tax paid.

7. Within 15 months after decedent's death, if U.S. Estate Tax Return was filed, the N.D. Estate Tax 
Return and supporting documents must be filed and tax paid [N.D.C.C. 57-37.1-07].

8. Within three years after decedent's death, creditors may file claims in estates in which Notice to 
Creditors was not published [N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-03].

(Revised 4/25/2022)

B. Times after which certain steps may be taken.

1. Any time after appointment of personal representative, Notice to Creditors (Form 6) may be 
published, but this isn't required [N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-01].

2. If Notice to Creditors is published, three months after first publication, personal representative 
shall proceed to pay claims allowed in the following order of priority [N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-05]:

a. Costs and expenses of administration.

b. Reasonable funeral expenses.

c. Debts and taxes with preference under federal law.

d. Reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the decedent, 
including compensation of persons attending the decedent.

e. Unpaid child support obligations.

f. Debts and taxes with preferences under other laws of this state.

g. All other claims.

3. After assets have been gathered and all claims paid, the personal representative may distribute 
remaining assets to the heirs. Personal property is distributed by Personal Representative's 
Assignment (Form 13). Real property is distributed to heirs or devisees by Personal Representative's 
Deed of Distribution (Form 11). Real property that is sold by a Personal Representative is transferred 
by a Personal Representative's Deed (Form 12). Deeds must be recorded along with a certified copy 
of personal representative's Letters Testamentary (Form 4) or Letters of Administration (Form 19), 
certified on or after the date of the deed.

C. Times after which certain steps can't be taken.

1. Three months after first publication of Notice to Creditors, time for filing claims expires. No claims 
may be filed by creditors after this date [N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-03].

2. Three years after decedent's death - generally no informal proceedings for appointment of 
personal representative may be started [N.D.C.C. 30.1-14-01].

3. Three years after decedent's death - time for filing claims expires in estates in which Notice to 
Creditors wasn't published. No claims may be filed by creditors after this date [N.D.C.C. 30.1-19-03].

(Revised 4/25/2022)

Distribution of the Estate  

Distribution is made as follows: 

A. If a Will.

If decedent left a Will, according to the decedent's Will, except: 

1. A devisee may renounce in writing devisee's interest under the Will [N.D.C.C. 30.1-10.1].

2. A surviving spouse may elect in writing, within the later of nine months after decedent's death or
six months after probate of the Will, to take one-half of the augmented estate regardless of what is
specified in the Will. Notice to interested persons and a court hearing are required on the written
petition filed with the court and personal representative [N.D.C.C. 30.1-05-01 and 30.1-05-05].

B. If no Will.

If the decedent left no Will, according to N.D. laws of intestate succession, as follows [N.D.C.C. 30.1-
04]:  

1. If decedent left a surviving spouse, the share of the intestate estate which a surviving spouse
receives is [N.D.C.C. 30.1-04-02]:

a. If there are no surviving descendants (such as children or grandchildren) or parent of the
deceased or if all of the surviving descendants of the deceased are also descendants of the
surviving spouse and there is no other descendant of the surviving spouse who survives the
decedent (for example, children from a prior marriage of the surviving spouse), the surviving
spouse receives the entire intestate estate.

b. If there are no surviving descendants, but the decedent is survived by a parent or parents, the
surviving spouse receives the first $300,000 of the estate assets, plus three-fourths of the 
balance of the intestate estate.

c. If there are surviving descendants of the decedent, all of whom are also descendants of the
surviving spouse, and surviving spouse also had descendants who are not descendants of the
decedent (i.e., surviving spouse has descendants from a prior marriage), the surviving spouse
receives the first $250,000 of the estate assets, plus one-half of the balance of the intestate 
estate.

d. If there are surviving descendants, one or more of whom are not descendants of the surviving
spouse, the surviving spouse receives the first $150,000 of the estate assets plus one-half of the 
balance of the intestate estate. 

(Revised 4/25/2022)

2. If part of the intestate estate doesn't pass to the surviving spouse as listed above, or if there is no 
surviving spouse, the intestate estate passes as follows:

a. To the descendants of the decedent, who will take by representation.

b. If there are no surviving descendants, to the decedent's parent or parents equally if both 
survive, or to the surviving parent.

c. If there are no surviving descendants or parent, to the descendants of the decedent's parents 
or either of them by representation (i.e., decedent's brothers and sisters, then nieces and 
nephews).

d. If there are no surviving descendants, parent, or descendants of a parent, but the decedent is 
survived by one or more grandparents or descendants of grandparents:

i. Half of the estate passes to the decedent's paternal grandparents equally if both survive, 
or to the surviving paternal grandparent, or to the descendants of the decedent's paternal 
grandparents or either of them if both are deceased, by representation; and

ii. The other half passes to the decedent's maternal relatives in the same manner.

e. If there is no surviving descendant, parent, or descendant of a parent, but the descendant is 
survived by one or more grandparents or descendants of grandparents on the paternal but not 
the maternal side, or on the maternal but not the paternal side, to the descendant's relatives on 
the side with one or more surviving members in the manner as describd in subsection d above.

f. If there is no surviving spouse, descendant, parents, descendant of a parent, grandparent, or 
descendant of a grandparent, but the intestate decedent has one deceased spouse who has one 
or more descendants who survive the decedent, to those descendants by representation or has 
more than one deceased spouse who has one or more descendants who survive the decedent, 
the estate is divided into as many equal shares as there are deceased spouses, each share passing 
to those descendants by representation.

3. An heir may renounce an interest and the surviving spouse make the election as in the estate 
where there is a Will.

(Revised 4/25/2022)

Closing the Estate 

A. After the claims have been paid and assets of the estate distributed, the estate is closed as follows:

1. For small estates(2) in which Notice to Creditors hasn't been published, file Sworn Statement of 
Personal Representative Closing a Small Estate (Form 16). It may be filed with district court anytime 
after assets have been distributed [N.D.C.C. 30.1-23-03 and 30.1-23-04].

2. For any size estates in which Notice to Creditors has been published, file Personal 
Representative's Verified Statement to Close Estate (Form 15). It may be filed with district court 
anytime after assets have been distributed, but not before three months after the first publication of 
Notice to Creditors [N.D.C.C. 30.1-21-03].

B. If no proceedings involving the Personal Representative are pending in the court one year after 
either closing statement is filed, the appointment of the personal representative terminates.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FORM 1: AFFIDAVIT FOR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL 
PROPERTY OF THE DECEDENT (30.1-23-01) 

Form 1 allows personal property to transfer without court involvement. You DON’T file the 
Affidavit for Collection of Personal Property of the Decedent with a North Dakota state court. 

You may use the Affidavit if the estate meets the following requirements: 
•
•

At least 30 days have passed since the person died;
The total net value of the probated property (minus any debts or other encumbrances on the 
property) is less than $50,000.00;
There’s NO real property (real estate) that is part of the probated estate (see the personal property 
and real property definitions on Page 16 of this guidebook);

•

• No probate case is started or completed in a North Dakota state district court, a court of any other 

state, or a tribal court; and
The heir claiming the personal property by affidavit is entitled to it by will or intestate succession.

•

The completed Affidavit is presented to whoever holds the personal property for transfer to the 
person entitled to receive it.  If you need a court order to transfer the property, you can’t use this form. 

NOTE:  You may wish to contact the holder of the personal property to find out if they will accept the 
Affidavit as a way to transfer the personal property to you. If the Affidavit won’t be accepted, see 
options B.1. and B.2. on Page 4 of this guidebook. 

If the deceased person didn’t leave a will, you’ll need to determine who the heirs of the estate are 
according to North Dakota’s intestate succession laws.  Intestate succession laws dictate who takes the 
deceased person’s property if they died without a will.  See Pages 8-9 of this guidebook for distribution 
of the estate if there’s no will.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
