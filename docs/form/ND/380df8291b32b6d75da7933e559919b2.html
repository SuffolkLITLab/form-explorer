NORTH DAKOTA LAWS & RULES RELATED TO EVICTION: 

Chapter 47-16 of the North Dakota Century Code governs leases in North Dakota. 

Chapter 47-32 of the North Dakota Century Code governs evictions in North Dakota.  The 
most common reason to evict a tenant is failure to pay their rent.  However, a tenant can be 
evicted for other material violations of a lease or rental agreement.  Examples of a material 
violation are:  unreasonable peace disturbances, illegal activity on the premises, unreported 
pets, too many occupants, or damage to the premises. 

Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure includes requirements for serving legal 
documents on defendants in a civil action. 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows eviction cases to be 
heard and decided by a Judicial Referee. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rules and rulings and court 
decisions.  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota 
law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the 
North Dakota Century Code are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws apply to your situation. 

THE EIGHT GROUNDS (REASONS) FOR EVICTION IN NORTH DAKOTA: 

A landlord may evict a tenant for one or more of the eight grounds (reasons) for eviction.  The 
most common grounds are in bold. 

1.  A party, by force, intimidation, fraud, or stealth, has entered upon the prior actual 

possession of real property of another and detains the same. 

2.  A party, after peaceably entering upon real property, turns out by force, threats, or 

menacing conduct the party in possession. 

3.  A party, by force or by menaces and threats of violence, unlawfully holds and keeps the 
possession of any real property, whether the possession was acquired peaceably or 
otherwise. 

4.  A lessee, in person or by subtenant, holds over after the termination of the lease or 

expiration of the lessee's term, or fails to pay rent for three days after the rent is due. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 3 of 19 

Ev Inst/Rev. May 2022 

5.  A party continues in possession after a sale of the real property under mortgage, 

execution, order, or any judicial process and after the expiration of the time fixed by law 
for redemption, or after the execution and delivery of a deed, or after the cancellation 
and termination of any contract for deed, bond for deed, or other instrument for the 
future conveyance of real estate or equity in the real estate. 

6.  A party continues wrongfully in possession after a judgment in partition or after a sale 

under an order or decree of a district court. 

7.  A lessee or a person on the premises with the lessee's consent acts in a manner that 

unreasonably disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises. 

8.  The lessee violates a material term of the written lease agreement between the lessor 

and lessee. 

PARTIES IN AN EVICTION: 

Plaintiff – the individual who owns property that was leased or rented to another; a landlord. 

Defendant – the person, or persons, who rents or holds the lease to a property; a tenant. 

DEFINITIONS OF SOME COMMONLY USED TERMS IN AN EVICTION: 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they are NOT intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Artificial Person – a person created by law, such as a business, corporation, or limited liability 
company. (See Natural Person) 

Costs – generally refers to expenses and fees for going to court.  For example, costs may include 
filing fees, charges for serving legal documents, and making copies of papers and exhibits.  If 
the court orders the eviction, the plaintiff may be awarded costs. 

Damages – money paid by defendants to successful plaintiffs in civil cases to compensate the 
plaintiffs for their injuries.  In an eviction, damages are limited to rents or profits that are past 
due, and damages caused by the tenant’s possession of the property.  Landlords can’t request 
an award of future rent when bringing an eviction. 

Forcible Detainer – a civil, legal process that is used to evict a tenant in North Dakota.  It is an 
accelerated, or sped up, civil legal action to determine the right to possess the property. 

 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 4 of 19 

Ev Inst/Rev. May 2022 

Judicial Referee – A judicial officer, appointed by the presiding District Court Judge, who has 
the authority to preside in eviction cases.  The findings and order of the Judicial Referee have 
the effect of the findings and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a written order 
of a District Court Judge.  

Lease Agreement – a contract by which one gives to another the temporary possession and use 
of real property for reward and the latter agrees to return such possession to the former at a 
future time.  A lease agreement may be in writing or may be an oral, or verbal, agreement. 

Lessor – the person who leases a property to another; a landlord. 

Lessee – the person who rents or holds the lease to a property; a tenant. 

Natural Person – a human being.  (See Artificial Person) 

Personal Property – anything that isn’t real property. 

Pro Se – a party in a lawsuit that represents himself or herself without a lawyer.  In other 
words, a self-represented individual. 

Real Property – real or immovable land including anything that is affixed to the land that is 
incidental or immovable by law. 

Writ of Execution – an order from the Judge or Judicial Referee needed to give possession of 
the property back to the landlord.  (The writ may also be referred to as a Writ of Execution for 
Possession, a Writ of Restitution, or a Writ of Eviction.)  A writ of execution can’t be issued until 
after the court orders an eviction.  

A JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY HEAR AND DECIDE THE EVICTION: 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows eviction cases to be 
heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the eviction case, any party to the case may request that a 
District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the eviction case is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will issue 
findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the same 
effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a written 
order of a District Court Judge. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 5 of 19 

Ev Inst/Rev. May 2022 

If any party to the eviction case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and 
order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for the 
review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to review.  

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

STEPS IN THE EVICTION PROCESS 

TEP ONE: 
PREPARE AND ARRANGE FOR SERVICE OF THE NOTICE OF INTENTION TO EVICT 

  S

Serving the Notice of Intention to Evict is the required first step in the eviction process in 
North Dakota. 

The tenant must be given notice of the intention to evict.  A copy of the Notice to Evict and 
proof that the notice to evict was properly served must be filed with the court in Step Three. 

(Review Chapter 47-32 for when the Notice of Intention to Evict may not be required.) 

Determine the Grounds (Reasons) for Eviction: 

You may evict a tenant for one or more of the eight grounds (reasons) for eviction.  Determine 
which ground or grounds apply to your situation.  You’ll be required to prove your ground(s). 

Prepare the Notice of Intention to Evict: 

The Notice of Intention to Evict gives the tenant notice of the ground(s) for eviction and tells 
them they must move out of the residence within 3 days. 

•  However, if the only ground for eviction is non-payment or late payment of rent, the 

notice gives the tenant 3 days to pay the full amount due or move out of the residence. 

There are two Notice of Intention to Evict forms in this packet of eviction forms.   

• 

If the only ground for eviction is non-payment or late payment of rent, use the “Notice 
of Intention to Evict: Demand for Rent or Possession of the Premises” form.   

•  Otherwise, use the “Notice of Intention to Evict” form. 

Fill out and sign the Notice of Intention to Evict: 

•  Fill in the first line with the name of the person renting from you (tenant). 
•  Fill in the street address, city and zip code of the property. 
•  Fill in the date the lease was signed or the date of the rental agreement. 
•  Check the boxes that apply and fill in the blanks, if applicable. 

o 

If you select “Other material violation of the lease, specifically:” explain the 
material violation. 

•  Date and sign the document. 
•  Make at least one copy for the court and one copy for your records. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 7 of 19 

Ev Inst/Rev. May 2022 

Arrange for Service of the Completed Notice of Intention to Evict on the Tenant(s): 

The Notice of Intention to Evict must be served on the tenant.  Review the service requirements 
of the Notice of Intention to Evict in North Dakota Century Code Section 47-32-02.  See also 
Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for service requirements that also apply. 

General service information and blank proof of service forms are available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action in the “Service to Start a Civil Action” 
section. 

There are two ways to arrange for service of the Notice of Intention to Evict. 

1.  You may give the Notice of Intention to Evict to the Sheriff of the county for personal 

service.  (You’ll be charged a fee.) 

a.  The Sheriff will provide a certificate of service. 
b.  The completed certificate of service is your proof of service. 

2.  You may have another person who is at least 18 years of age and not a party to or 

interested in the eviction action serve the Notice of Intention to Evict.  The person must 
serve the documents as required by Rule 4(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 

a.  The person who served the Notice of Intention to Evict must fill out, date and 

sign an Affidavit of Service by Personal Delivery. 

b.  The completed Affidavit of Service by Personal Delivery is your proof of service. 

At least one attempt must be made to serve the Notice of Intention to Evict on the tenant using 
either of the two methods above.  An attempt must be made between the hours of six p.m. and 
ten p.m. 

After at least one attempt, when the tenant(s) can’t be found, there is one way to arrange for 
service of the Notice of Intention to Evict. 

1.  The Sheriff of the county or a process server posts the Notice of Intention to Evict 

conspicuously upon the premises. 

a.  A certificate of service by the Sheriff or process server is your proof of service. 

If the tenant is served the Notice of Intention to Evict by posting the Notice to Evict 
conspicuously upon the premises, proof is required that the sheriff or process server attempted 
service, and that service was attempted at least once between six p.m. and ten p.m.

STEP TWO: 
PREPARE THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT, 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER, PROPOSED JUDGMENT, PROPOSED WRIT 
OF EXECUTION, AND STATEMENT OF COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS 

If the tenant doesn’t comply with the Notice of Intention to Evict within 3 days, you may file the 
original Summons and Complaint with the District Court and arrange for service of a copy of the 
Summons and Complaint on the tenant(s). 

The Summons and Complaint give notice to the tenant(s) of the date and time of the eviction 
hearing, and the reason(s) for the eviction action. 

Make at least two copies of each completed form.  One copy of the Summons and Complaint 
must be served on each tenant.  Keep one copy of each completed form for your records. 

Make a Copy of the Written Lease Agreement: 

If you have a written lease agreement, make a copy.  You’ll file the copy of the lease agreement 
with the District Court when you file the completed eviction forms. 

If You’re Requesting Damages, Make a Copy of Your Documentation of the Costs: 

In an eviction, a landlord can only ask for costs related to damages caused by the tenant’s 
possession of the property. 

If you’re planning to request the cost of damages caused by the tenant, make copies of your 
documentation showing how you arrived at the dollar amount you claim. 

Prepare the Summons: 

•  Fill out the heading: 

o  Name of County – this is the county in North Dakota where you’ll file the case. 
o  Plaintiff – you’re the Plaintiff.  Fill in your full name. 



person, you can’t use these forms.

o  Case Number – Leave blank.  You’ll get a case number from the Clerk of Court 
when you file the case and pay the $80.00 filing fee.  You’ll fill in the case 
number at that time.

STEP FOUR: 
ARRANGE FOR SERVICE OF COPIES OF THE COMPLETED SUMMONS AND 
COMPLAINT ON THE TENANT(S) 

Review Section 47-32-02 of the North Dakota Century Code for service requirements.  

There are two of ways to arrange for service of a copy of the summons and complaint on the 
tenant(s).  The timeline for service depends on the way the copy of the summons and 
complaint are served. 

You’ll be required to file proof of service with the court of a copy of the summons and 
complaint on each tenant. 

General service information and blank proof of service forms are available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action in the “Service to Start a Civil Action” 
section. 

In person service on the tenant(s).  Arrange for service in one of the following two ways: 

1.  You may give the copy of the Summons and Complaint to the Sheriff of the county for 
personal service.  (You’ll be charged a fee.)  The Sheriff will provide a certificate of 
service.  The completed certificate of service is your proof of service. 

2.  You may have another person who is at least 18 years of age and not a party to or 

interested in the eviction action serve the copy of the Summons and Complaint.  The 
person must serve the documents as required by Rule 4(d) of the North Dakota Rules of 
Civil Procedure.  The person who served the summons and complaint must fill out, date 
and sign an Affidavit of Service by Personal Delivery.  The completed Affidavit of Service 
by Personal Delivery is your proof of service. 

If the tenant(s) can’t be found in the county, the following conditions apply to service: 

•  Proof that the sheriff or process server attempted to serve the tenant in person, and 
that personal service was attempted at least once between six p.m. and ten p.m. 

•  An affidavit must be filed by the plaintiff that states: 

o  The defendant can’t be found, or the defendant isn’t in this state. 
o  A copy of the summons and complaint has been mailed to the tenant at the 

tenant's last-known address, if any is known to the plaintiff. 

•  Then, service of the summons may be made upon the defendant by the sheriff or 

process server posting the summons upon the door of the residential unit.

Timelines for service of the completed summons and complaint of the tenant(s) 

• 

If the tenant is personally served a copy of the summons and complaint within the 
county: 

o  Service must be completed at least three days before the time set for the 

•  Otherwise, service must be completed at least seven days before the time set for the 

eviction hearing. 

eviction hearing. 

Prior to the hearing, file proof of service with the court of a copy of the summons and 
complaint on each tenant. 

STEP FIVE: 
ATTEND THE EVICTION HEARING 

The eviction hearing is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the Judge or 
Judicial Referee. 

The landlord and tenant each have an opportunity to tell their side of the facts of the eviction 
and argue how the eviction laws apply to the situation.  The Judge or Judicial Referee weighs 
the facts and arguments presented by the landlord and tenant and either grants or dismisses 
the eviction. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible. 

Don’t be late! 

Don’t be late for your eviction hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason why you can’t 
go to the eviction hearing on the scheduled day or will be late, call the Clerk of District Court’s 
office as soon as possible. 

Be aware that even if you contact the Clerk of District Court’s office, the Judge or Judicial 
Referee may decide to hold the eviction hearing without you or dismiss the eviction case 
entirely.

Bring the information, documents, etc. that you prepared for the hearing: 

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc. that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
eviction hearing.  This may include copies of the lease, ledgers showing payments, photos, 
witnesses, etc. 

Bring an outline of what you want to say. 

Conduct of the hearing: 

In general, an eviction hearing proceeds in the following order: 

Before the hearing officially begins: 

•  Organize your files and paperwork so you can easily locate information as needed. 

•  The tenant or the tenant’s attorney may give you copies of their documents before the 

hearing starts. 

The eviction hearing officially begins when all are asked to rise when the Judge or Judicial 
Referee comes into the courtroom: 

•  The Judge or Judicial Referee begins the eviction hearing by identifying any documents 

that were submitted to the court clerk and identifying the names of the parties. 

•  The tenant or the tenant’s attorney may give you copies of their documents, if copies 

were not given to you before the hearing began. 

Opening statements: 

•  Often, each side gives an opening statement.  An opening statement describes the 

issues in the eviction and states what the party expects to prove during the hearing. 

•  Usually, you, the Plaintiff, go first and the tenant, the Defendant, goes last. 

You present your case first: 

•  Usually, you, the Plaintiff, present your case first. 

• 

Individuals with first-hand knowledge of the facts of the eviction, such as the landlord, 
property manager, managing agent, or site manager, are called to testify as a witness.  
Each witness sits in the stand and is sworn in.  

•  You ask each witness questions to present evidence of the facts of the eviction to the 

court. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 16 of 19 

Ev Inst/Rev. May 2022 

For example: 

o  Who the tenant is and how they know the tenant; 
o  The location of the property; 
o 

Identification of the documents you want the court to allow as evidence, such as: 
the lease and payment ledger; 

o  Rent amount, amount of rent owed; and 
o  Anything else that pertains to why the eviction action was brought. 

• 

If the tenant objects to the questions or evidence being presented, the tenant may 
object when the question is asked, or when evidence is presented.  The North Dakota 
Rules of Evidence govern how the tenant objects to evidence. 

The Defendant has the option to cross-examine your witnesses: 

•  After you finish direct questioning of a witness, the tenant has a chance to ask the 

witness questions.  This is called cross-examination. 

•  The tenant can only ask questions about the topics covered during your direct 

questioning of your witness. 

• 

If the tenant doesn’t have any questions, the Judge or Judicial Referee will allow the 
witness to go back to their seat.  

The Defendant presents their case: 

•  After you finish presenting your case, the tenant presents the evidence of their side of 

the facts of the eviction.  The tenant may testify on their own behalf. 

•  The tenant may call individuals with first-hand knowledge of their side of the facts of the 

eviction, to testify as their witness.  Each witness sits in the stand and is sworn in. 

•  The tenant asks each witness questions to present evidence of the facts of the eviction 
to the court.  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern how they present evidence. 

• 

If you object to the questions or evidence the tenant presents, you may object when the 
question is asked, or when evidence is presented.

You have the option cross-examine the Defendant’s witnesses: 

•  After the tenant finishes direct questioning of their witness, you have the chance to ask 

their witness questions.  This is called cross-examination. 

•  You can only ask questions about the topics covered during the tenant’s direct 

questioning of their witness. 

• 

If you don’t have any questions, the Judge or Judicial Referee will allow the witness to 
go back to their seat. 

Closing arguments: 

•  Often, each side gives a closing argument.  A closing argument is a summary of the 

evidence presented at the hearing and an argument to the Judge or Judicial Referee on 
how the case should be decided. 

•  Usually, you, the Plaintiff, go first and the Defendant goes last. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee will then either order the eviction or dismiss the case:  

•  The Judge or Judicial Referee gives a summary of the documents entered into evidence 

and the testimony from everyone who testified. 

• 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee orders the eviction, you’ll be given a date of eviction.  
The tenant and all of their belongings must be moved out on that date. 

o 

If the case is complicated, a Judge or Judicial Referee may decide to reserve 
judgment. This means that the Judge or Judicial Referee will mail their decision 
about the case. 

•  You can ask for a money judgment, which may include: outstanding rent, fees 

associated with the service of notice of eviction and service of summons and complaint, 
late charges, and attorney’s fees.   

Before you leave the hearing: 

Before you leave the hearing, make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you’re not 
sure.
