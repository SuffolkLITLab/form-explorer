      <pre>MOTION FOR AN EX-PARTE (EMERGENCY) INTERIM ORDER 

A Research Guide for a North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide IS NOT a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your research into motions for ex-parte 
(emergency) interim orders in family law cases in North Dakota state district court.  This 
information is not intended for legal advice and cannot replace the advice of competent legal 
counsel licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

(Neither the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center nor the North Dakota Court System have 
forms or instructions available specifically for motions for ex-parte interim orders.  If you 
represent yourself, you will need to create your own ex-parte motion legal documents, or 
retain an attorney to do so. 

The basic steps in the ex-parte motion process start on Page 5.  The steps include the names and 
general descriptions of some of the legal documents you will need to create and prepare.) 

OVERVIEW OF MOTIONS FOR EX-PARTE (EMERGENCY) INTERIM ORDERS: 

What is a Motion for an Interim Order? 

After a domestic relations case has begun, any party in the case may make a motion for an 
interim order.  A motion for an interim order cannot be used to start a case. 

A motion for an interim order is a written request for a temporary order for support, parental 
rights and responsibilities, attorney’s fees and costs, and use of property. 

The other party may answer the motion for an interim order with their own written requests. 

A hearing is required.  At the hearing, both parties present evidence to support their requests in 
the motion and the answer to motion. 

The interim order, if signed by the court, is in effect until there is a different or final decision in 
the case.

ExParte Motion/Apr 2019 

What is a Motion for an Ex-Parte (Emergency) Interim Order? 

Ex-parte means without notice to or argument from the other party. 

A motion for an ex-parte interim order is filed with the court without first giving written notice 
to the other party or giving the other party the chance to respond. 

Ex-parte interim orders are rarely granted and will only be issued if the judge decides that there 
are exceptional circumstances present. 

Exceptional Circumstances Include: 

•  A threat of imminent danger to someone or a minor child of such person,  
• 
If a court finds evidence that someone is in need of protection; and/or  
• 
If the court finds evidence that the marital estate requires protection.  

An ex-parte interim order is granted by a judge who makes a decision on the motion based only 
on your documents, affidavits of evidence, and before holding the required hearing.   

If the judge grants an ex-parte interim order, an evidentiary hearing MUST be held within 30 
days of the court granting the ex-parte interim order. 

The party who made the motion MUST prove what they alleged in their written motion for an 
ex-parte interim order. 

What is a Domestic Relations Case? 

Before any party can request an interim order, a domestic relations case must have already 
begun with service of the summons and complaint, or summons and petition. 

Domestic relations cases are family disputes involving the rights and duties of spouses, parents, 
children, etc.  

For example:  

•  Divorce – The only way to legally end a marriage. The two married individuals become 

unmarried once their divorce is granted by a court.  

•  Legal separation – A process similar to the requirements for granting a divorce. 

However, unlike a divorce, legal separation does not end the marriage, but it does end 
many of the legal responsibilities spouses have to each other, while they are married.  
•  Establishing parenting rights and responsibilities – A process involving parents who were 

never married to each other, which determines all the rights and responsibilities a 
parent has concerning the parent’s child, including custody and visitation. 

•  Paternity – The establishment of a father-child relationship.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to motions for interim orders is to use the print version of 
the North Dakota Century Code to locate the short summaries of case law after each Section.  
Case law summaries directly follow the text of the Century Code Section.  To view the full text 
of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court Opinions” link and enter 
the case name or case citation. 

You may also research case law by topic at www.ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Supreme Court 
Opinions” link, the “By Topic” link, and then on the links that correspond to your research topic.

Moving Party – Filing the Motion for Ex-Parte Interim Order Documents With the Clerk of 
Court: 

The Moving Party files their motion for ex-parte interim order documents with the clerk of 
district court of the North Dakota County where the domestic relations case is filed. 

The documents are filed using the same case number as the domestic relations case. 

The Moving Party will not be required to pay a filing fee. 

If There has been an Appearance in the Case by the Opposing Party 

If there has been an appearance in the case by the Opposing party, or if the Moving party has 
knowledge that the Opposing party is represented by a lawyer, the Moving Party must notify 
the court.  

After receiving notice of the appearance or representation, the court must attempt to hold an 
emergency hearing, either in person or by telephonic conference, at which both the Moving

Moving Party – MUST Arrange to Serve the Ex-Parte Interim Order and Notice of Hearing 

After the Moving Party gets a hearing date, the Moving Party must arrange for personal service 
of the following on the Opposing Party: 

•  Copy of the Ex-Parte Interim Order (signed and dated by judge); and 
•  Notice of Hearing. 

Serving (giving) copies of the ex-parte interim order and notice of hearing is an essential step in 
the legal process. 

The requirements for personal service are in Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  The Rule 4 requirements are included in the service information and instructions to 
start a civil action available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

The Court requires proof that the ex-parte interim order and notice of hearing were served. 

An affidavit of service is the proof of service.  However, if a sheriff served the documents, a 
certificate of service is the proof of service. 

The document(s) showing proof of service must be filed with the clerk of district court. 

Opposing Party – MUST Attend the Hearing to Present Objections and Make Requests 

When the Opposing Party is served a copy of the ex-parte interim order and notice of hearing, if 
the Opposing Party objects, the Opposing Party must appear at the hearing to have their 
objections heard by the Court. 

At the hearing, the Moving Party must prove the allegations they made in their motion for an 
ex-parte interim order. 

At the hearing, the Opposing Party may challenge the Moving Party’s evidence, present their 
own evidence, and make their own requests for the interim order. 

Opposing Party – MUST Give Notice of Intent to Cross-Examine 

If the Moving Party filed affidavits from other people with their motion for an ex-parte interim 
motion, the Opposing Party may cross-examine those people at the hearing. 

To ensure the people who provided affidavits to the Moving Party attend the hearing, the 
Opposing Party MUST give written notice to the Moving Party at least 24 hours before the 
hearing.  Otherwise, the people who provided affidavits are not required to appear. 

See Page 29 of the Motion for Interim Order: Domestic Relations Informational Guide for more 
information.

ExParte Motion/Apr 2019 

Moving Party & Opposing Party – Attend the Hearing 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you will need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Do not miss your hearing date and time. 

If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you cannot get to court on the date and time 
scheduled for the hearing, call the courthouse as soon as you can.  

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge hears both sides and then issues a final interim order.  Sometimes, the final interim 
order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final interim order is issued at a later date.  

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Moving Party goes first. 

•  Moving Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Moving Party presents their case first. 
o  The Opposing Party may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Moving 

Party’s evidence. 

•  Opposing Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Opposing Party presents their case after the Moving Party. 
o  The Moving Party may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Opposing 

Party’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Opposing Party goes first. 

The judge will decide if the Moving Party proved the allegations they made in their motion for 
an ex-parte interim order.  The judge will decide whether to allow the ex-parte interim order to 
continue as-is, to allow the ex-parte interim order to expire without granting a new interim 
order, or to grant a different interim order.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
