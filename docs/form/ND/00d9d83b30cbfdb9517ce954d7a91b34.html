2.

Sixty days after the effective date of the acknowledgment or denial, as provided in 
section 14-20-14; or
The date of the first hearing, in a proceeding to which the signatory is a party, before a 
court   to   adjudicate   an   issue   relating   to   the   child,   including   a   proceeding   that 
establishes support.

14-20-18. (308) Challenge after expiration of period for rescission.
1.

a. On the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact; and
b. Within two years after the acknowledgment or denial is filed with the department

2.

A  party  challenging   an   acknowledgment   of   paternity  or   denial   of   paternity  has   the 
burden of proof.

14-20-19. (309) Procedure for rescission or challenge.
1.

Every signatory to an acknowledgment of paternity and any related denial of paternity 
must be made a party to a proceeding to rescind or challenge the acknowledgment or 
denial.
For the purpose of rescission of, or challenge to, an acknowledgment of paternity or 
denial of paternity, a signatory submits to personal jurisdiction of this state by signing 
the   acknowledgment   or   denial,   effective   upon   the   filing   of   the   document   with   the 
department of health and human services.
Except   for   good  cause   shown,   during  the  pendency  of   a  proceeding   to  rescind  or 
challenge an acknowledgment of paternity or denial of paternity, the court may not 
suspend   the   legal   responsibilities   of   a   signatory  arising   from   the   acknowledgment, 
including the duty to pay child support.
A proceeding to rescind or to challenge an acknowledgment of paternity or denial of 
paternity   must   be   conducted   in   the   same   manner   as   a   proceeding   to   adjudicate 
parentage under sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-58.
At   the   conclusion   of   a   proceeding   to   rescind   or   challenge   an   acknowledgment   of 
paternity  or   denial   of   paternity,   the   court   shall   order   the  department   of   health  and 
human services to amend the birth record of the child, if appropriate.

denial and to courts and appropriate state or federal agencies of this or another state.

14-20-24. (314) Adoption of rules.
The  department   of   health  and   human   services  may   adopt   rules   to   implement   sections 

14-20-11 through 14-20-23.

14-20-25. (501) Scope.
Sections 14-20-25 through 14-20-35 govern genetic testing of an individual to determine

2.

Voluntarily submits to testing; or
Is tested pursuant to an order of the court or a support enforcement agency.

14-20-26. (502) Order for testing.
1.

order   the   child   and   other   designated   individuals   to  submit   to  genetic   testing   if   the 
request for testing is supported by the sworn statement of a party to the proceeding:
a.

Alleging paternity and stating facts establishing a reasonable probability of the 
requisite sexual contact between the individuals; or

b. Denying paternity and stating facts establishing a possibility that sexual contact 

between the individuals, if any, did not result in the conception of the child.

A support enforcement agency may order genetic testing only if there is no presumed, 
acknowledged, or adjudicated father.
If a request for genetic testing of a child is made before birth, the court or support 
enforcement agency may not order in utero testing.
If two or more men are subject to court-ordered genetic testing, the testing may be 
ordered concurrently or sequentially.

human services.

c.

A  specimen   used   in   genetic   testing   may   consist   of   one   or   more   samples,   or   a 
combination of samples, of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 
The specimen used in the testing need not be of the same kind for each individual 
undergoing genetic testing.

Page No. 6

3.

Based   on   the   ethnic   or   racial   group   of   an   individual,   the   testing   laboratory   shall 
determine the databases from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 
probability of paternity. If there is a disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, 
the following rules apply:
a.

The individual objecting may require the testing laboratory, within thirty days after 
receipt of the report of the test, to recalculate the probability of paternity using an 
ethnic or racial group different from that used by the laboratory.
The individual objecting to the testing laboratory's initial choice shall:
(1)

If the frequencies are not available to the testing laboratory for the ethnic or 
racial   group   requested,   provide   the   requested   frequencies   compiled   in   a 
manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or

b.

c.

(2) Engage another testing laboratory to perform the calculations.
The testing laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there is a question 
regarding   which   ethnic   or   racial   group   is   appropriate.   If   available,   the   testing 
laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics for any other ethnic or 
racial group requested.

4.

If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic testing does not 
rebuttably identify a man as the father of a child under section 14-20-29, an individual 
who has been tested may be required to submit to additional genetic testing.

14-20-28. (504) Report of genetic testing.
1.

A report of genetic testing must be in a record and signed under penalty of perjury by a 
designee of the testing laboratory. A report made under the requirements of sections 
14-20-25 through 14-20-35 is self-authenticating.

2. Documentation from the testing laboratory of the following information is sufficient to 
establish a reliable chain of custody that allows the results of genetic testing to be 
admissible without testimony:
a.

The   names   and   photographs   of   the   individuals   whose   specimens   have   been 
taken;
The names of the individuals who collected the specimens;
The places and dates the specimens were collected;
The   names   of   the   individuals   who   received   the   specimens   in   the   testing 
laboratory; and
The dates the specimens were received.

b.
c.
d.

e.

14-20-29. (505) Genetic testing results - Rebuttal.
1. Under this chapter, a man is rebuttably identified as the father of a child if the genetic 
testing complies with sections 14-20-25 through 14-20-35 and the results disclose that:
The man has at least a ninety-nine percent probability of paternity, using a prior 
a.
probability  of   five-tenths,   as  calculated   by  using   the   combined   paternity  index 
obtained in the testing; and
A combined paternity index of at least one hundred to one.

b.
A man identified under subsection 1 as the father of the child may rebut the genetic 
testing  results  only by other  genetic  testing  satisfying  the  requirements  of   sections 
14-20-25 through 14-20-35 which:
a.
b.
Except as otherwise provided in section 14-20-34, if more than one man is identified 
by genetic testing as the possible father of the child, the court shall order them to 
submit to further genetic testing to identify the genetic father.

Excludes the man as a genetic father of the child; or
Identifies another man as the possible father of the child.

2.

3.

14-20-30. (506) Costs of genetic testing.
1.

Subject to assessment of costs under sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-58, the cost of 
initial genetic testing must be advanced:

Page No. 7

a.

By   a   support   enforcement   agency   in   a   proceeding   in   which   the   support 
enforcement agency is providing services;
By the individual who made the request;
As agreed by the parties; or
As ordered by the court.

b.
c.
d.
In cases in which the cost is advanced by the support enforcement agency, the agency 
may seek reimbursement from a man who is rebuttably identified as the father.

2.

14-20-31. (507) Additional genetic testing.
The court or the support enforcement agency shall order additional genetic testing upon the 
request of a party who contests the result of the original testing. If the previous genetic testing 
identified a man as the father of the child under section 14-20-29, the court or agency may not 
order additional testing unless the party provides advance payment for the testing.

14-20-32. (508) Genetic testing when specimens not available.
1.

Subject to subsection 2, if a genetic-testing specimen is not available from a man who 
may   be   the   father   of   a   child,   for   good   cause   and   under   circumstances   the   court 
considers to be just, the court may order the following individuals to submit specimens 
for genetic testing:
a.
b.
c. Other children of the man and their mothers; and
d. Other relatives of the man necessary to complete genetic testing.
Issuance   of   an   order   under   this   section   requires   a   finding   that   a  need   for   genetic 
testing outweighs the legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested.

The parents of the man;
Brothers and sisters of the man;

14-20-33. (509) Deceased individual.
For good cause shown, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased individual.

14-20-34. (510) Identical brothers.
1.

The court may order genetic testing of a brother of a man identified as the father of a 
child   if   the   man   is   commonly   believed   to   have   an   identical   brother   and   evidence 
suggests that the brother may be the genetic father of the child.
If each brother satisfies the requirements as the identified father of the child under 
section 14-20-29 without consideration of another identical brother being identified as 
the father of the child, the court may rely on nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which 
brother is the father of the child.

2.

2.

14-20-35. (511) Confidentiality of genetic testing.
The   report   of   genetic   testing   for   parentage   is   confidential.  An   individual   who   knowingly 
releases an identifiable specimen of another individual for any purpose other than that relevant 
to the proceeding regarding parentage without a court order or the written permission of the 
individual who furnished the specimen is subject to section 12.1-13-01.

14-20-36. (601) Proceeding authorized.
A civil proceeding may be maintained to adjudicate the parentage of a child. The proceeding 

is governed by the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.

14-20-37. (602) Standing to maintain proceeding.
Subject   to   sections   14-20-11   through   14-20-24   and   sections   14-20-42   and   14-20-44,   a 

proceeding to adjudicate parentage may be maintained by:

1.
2.
3.
4.

The child;
The mother of the child;
A man whose paternity of the child is to be adjudicated;
The support enforcement agency;

Page No. 8

5.
6.

An authorized adoption agency or licensed child-placing agency; or
A representative authorized by law to act for an individual who would otherwise be 
entitled to maintain a proceeding but who is deceased, incapacitated, or a minor.

14-20-38. (603) Parties to proceeding.
The following individuals must be joined as parties in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage:
1.
2.

The mother of the child; and
A man whose paternity of the child is to be adjudicated.

14-20-39. (604) Personal jurisdiction.
1.

2.

3.

An individual may not be adjudicated to be a parent unless the court has personal 
jurisdiction over the individual.
A court of this state having jurisdiction to adjudicate parentage may exercise personal 
jurisdiction   over   a   nonresident   individual,   or   the   guardian   or   conservator   of   the 
individual, if the conditions prescribed in section 14-12.2-04 are fulfilled.
Lack of jurisdiction over one individual does not preclude the court from making an 
adjudication   of   parentage   binding   on   another   individual   over   whom   the   court   has 
personal jurisdiction.

14-20-40. (605) Venue.
Venue for a proceeding to adjudicate parentage is in the county of this state in which:
1.
2.
3.

The child resides or is found;
The respondent resides or is found if the child does not reside in this state; or
A proceeding for probate or administration of the presumed or alleged father's estate 
has been commenced.

14-20-41.   (606)   No   limitation  -  Child   having   no   presumed,   acknowledged,   or 

adjudicated father.

A proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having no presumed, acknowledged, or 

adjudicated father may be commenced at any time, even after:

1.
2.

The child becomes an adult, but only if the child initiates the proceeding; or
An   earlier   proceeding   to   adjudicate   paternity   has   been   dismissed   based   on   the 
application of a statute of limitation then in effect.

14-20-42. (607) Limitation - Child having presumed father.
1.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a proceeding brought by a presumed 
father, the mother, or another individual to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a 
presumed father must be commenced not later than two years after the birth of the 
child.
A proceeding seeking to disprove the father-child relationship between a child and the 
child's presumed father may be maintained at any time if the court determines that:
a.

The presumed father and the mother of the child neither cohabited nor engaged 
in sexual intercourse with each other during the probable time of conception; and
The presumed father never openly held out the child as his own.

b.
For purposes of this section and section 14-20-43, an action to establish support for a 
child   is   a  proceeding   to  adjudicate   parentage   if   the  child's   presumed   father   raises 
nonpaternity as a defense to the action.

2.

3.

14-20-43. (608) Authority to deny motion for genetic testing.
1.

In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child having a presumed father or to 
challenge the paternity of a child having an acknowledged father, the court may deny a 
motion seeking an order for genetic testing of the mother, the child, and the presumed 
or acknowledged father if the court determines that:
a.

The conduct of the mother or the presumed or acknowledged father estops that 
party from denying parentage; and

Page No. 9

2.

3.

5.

b.

It would be inequitable to disprove the father-child relationship between the child 
and the presumed or acknowledged father.

c.

b.

In determining whether to deny a motion seeking an order for genetic testing under 
this   section,   the   court   shall   consider   the   best   interest   of   the   child,   including   the 
following factors:
a.

The length of time between the proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time 
that the presumed or acknowledged father was placed on notice that he might not 
be the genetic father;
The   length   of   time   during   which   the   presumed   or   acknowledged   father   has 
assumed the role of father of the child;
The facts surrounding the presumed or acknowledged father's discovery of his 
possible nonpaternity;
The   nature   of   the   relationship   between   the   child   and   the   presumed   or 
acknowledged father;
The age of the child;
The harm that may result to the child if presumed or acknowledged paternity is 
successfully disproved;
The nature of the relationship between the child and any alleged father;
The extent to which the passage of time reduces the chances of establishing the 
paternity of another man and a child support obligation in favor of the child; and
i. Other   factors   that   may   affect   the   qualities   arising   from   the   disruption   of   the 
father-child relationship between the child and the presumed or acknowledged 
father or the chance of other harm to the child.

e.
f.

g.
h.

d.

In a proceeding involving the application of this section, a minor or incapacitated child 
must be represented by a guardian ad litem.

4. Denial of a motion seeking an order for genetic testing must be based on clear and 

convincing evidence.
If the court denies a motion seeking an order for genetic testing, it shall issue an order 
adjudicating the presumed or acknowledged father to be the father of the child.

2.

14-20-44. (609) Limitation - Child having acknowledged or adjudicated father.
1.

If a child has an acknowledged father, a signatory to the acknowledgment of paternity 
or   denial   of   paternity   may   commence   a   proceeding   seeking   to   rescind   the 
acknowledgment or denial or challenge the paternity of the child only within the time 
allowed under section 14-20-17 or 14-20-18.
If a child has an acknowledged father or an adjudicated father, an individual, other 
than the child, who is neither a signatory to the acknowledgment of a paternity nor a 
party to the adjudication and who seeks an adjudication of paternity of the child must 
commence   a   proceeding   not   later   than   two   years   after   the   effective   date   of   the 
acknowledgment or adjudication.
A  proceeding   under   this   section   is   subject   to   the   application   of   the   principles   of 
estoppel established in section 14-20-43.

3.

14-20-45. (610) Joinder of proceedings.
1.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a proceeding to adjudicate parentage 
may   be   joined   with   a   proceeding   for   adoption,   termination   of   parental   rights,   child 
custody or visitation, child support, divorce, annulment, legal separation or separate 
maintenance, probate or administration of an estate, or other appropriate proceeding.
A respondent may not join a proceeding described in subsection 1 with a proceeding 
to adjudicate parentage brought under chapter 14-12.2.

2.

14-20-46. (611) Proceeding before birth.
A proceeding to determine parentage may be commenced before the birth of the child, but 
may not be concluded until after the birth of the child. The following actions may be taken before 
the birth of the child:

Page No. 10

Service of process;

1.
2. Discovery; and
3.

Except as prohibited by section 14-20-26, collection of specimens for genetic testing.

14-20-47. (612) Child as party - Representation.
1.

2.

A minor child is a permissible party, but is not a necessary party to a proceeding under 
sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-58.
The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent a minor or incapacitated child 
if the child is a party or the court finds that the interests of the child are not adequately 
represented.

14-20-48. (621) Admissibility of results of genetic testing - Expenses.
1.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a record of a genetic-testing expert is 
admissible as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the report unless a party 
objects to its admission within fourteen days after its receipt by the objecting party and 
cites specific grounds for exclusion. The admissibility of the report is not affected by 
whether the testing was performed:
a.

Voluntarily or pursuant to an order of the court or a support enforcement agency; 
or
Before or after the commencement of the proceeding.

b.
A party objecting to the results of genetic testing may call one or more genetic-testing 
experts to testify in person or by telephone, videoconference, deposition, or another 
method   approved   by   the   court.   Unless   otherwise   ordered   by   the   court,   the   party 
offering the testimony bears the expense for the expert testifying.
If a child has a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated father, the results of genetic 
testing are inadmissible to adjudicate parentage unless performed:
a. With   the   consent   of   both   the   mother   and   the   presumed,   acknowledged,   or 

2.

3.

adjudicated father; or
Pursuant to an order of the court under section 14-20-26.

b.

4. Copies of bills for genetic testing and for prenatal and postnatal health care for the 
mother   and   child   which   are   furnished   to  the   adverse   party  not   less   than   ten   days 
before the date of a hearing are admissible to establish:
a.
b.

The amount of the charges billed; and
That the charges were reasonable, necessary, and customary.

14-20-49. (622) Consequences of declining genetic testing.
1.
2.

An order for genetic testing is enforceable by contempt.
If   an   individual   whose   paternity  is   being   determined   declines   to   submit   to   genetic 
testing   ordered   by   the   court,   the   court   for   that   reason   may   adjudicate   parentage 
contrary to the position of that individual.

3. Genetic testing of the mother of a child is not a condition precedent to testing the child 
and   a   man   whose   paternity   is   being   determined.   If   the   mother   is   unavailable   or 
declines to submit to genetic testing, the court may order the testing of the child and 
every man whose paternity is being adjudicated.

14-20-50. (623) Admission of paternity authorized.
1.

A respondent in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage may admit to the paternity of a 
child by filing a pleading to that effect or by admitting paternity under penalty of perjury 
when making an appearance or during a hearing.
If   the   court   finds   that   the   admission   of   paternity  satisfies   the   requirements   of   this 
section and finds that there is no reason to question the admission, the court shall 
issue an order adjudicating the child to be the child of the man admitting paternity.

2.

Page No. 11

14-20-51. (624) Temporary order.
1.

In a proceeding under  sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-58, the court shall issue a 
temporary order for support of a child if the order is appropriate and the individual 
ordered to pay support is:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
A temporary order may include provisions for custody and visitation as provided by 
other law of this state.

A presumed father of the child;
Petitioning to have his paternity adjudicated;
Identified as the father through genetic testing under section 14-20-29;
An alleged father who has declined to submit to genetic testing;
Shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the father of the child; or
The mother of the child.

2.

14-20-52. (631) Rules for adjudication of paternity.
The court shall apply the following rules to adjudicate the paternity of a child:
1.

The paternity of a child having a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated father may 
be disproved only by admissible results of genetic testing excluding that man as the 
father of the child or identifying another man as the father of the child.

2. Unless   the  results  of   genetic   testing   are  admitted  to  rebut   other   results  of   genetic 
testing,   a   man   identified   as   the   father   of   a   child   under   section   14-20-29   must   be 
adjudicated the father of the child.
If   the   court   finds   that   genetic   testing   under   section   14-20-29   neither   identifies   nor 
excludes a man as the father of a child, the court may not dismiss the proceeding. In 
that   event,   the   results   of   genetic   testing,   and   other   evidence,   are   admissible   to 
adjudicate the issue of paternity.

3.

4. Unless   the  results  of   genetic   testing   are  admitted  to  rebut   other   results  of   genetic 
testing, a man excluded as the father of a child by genetic testing must be adjudicated 
not to be the father of the child.

14-20-53. (632) Jury prohibited.
The court, without a jury, shall adjudicate paternity of a child.

14-20-54. (633) Hearings - Inspection of records.
1. On request of a party and for good cause shown, the court may close a proceeding 

2.

under sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-58.
A final order in a proceeding under sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-58 is available for 
public inspection. Other papers and records are available only with the consent of the 
parties or on order of the court for good cause.

14-20-55. (634) Order on default.
The court shall issue an order adjudicating the paternity of a man who:
1.
2.

After service of process, is in default; and 
Is found by the court to be the father of a child.

14-20-56. (635) Dismissal for want of prosecution.
The court may issue an order dismissing a proceeding commenced under this chapter for 
want   of   prosecution   only   without   prejudice.  An   order   of   dismissal   for   want   of   prosecution 
purportedly with prejudice is void and has only the effect of a dismissal without prejudice.

14-20-57. (636) Order adjudicating parentage.
1.

The court shall issue an order adjudicating whether a man alleged or claiming to be 
the father is the parent of the child.
An order adjudicating parentage must identify the child by name and date of birth.
The order must include the social security numbers of the child and the individuals 
determined to be the child's parents.

2.
3.

5.

The order may contain any other provision in the best interest of the child, including 
payment of support, payment of expenses of the mother's pregnancy and confinement, 
custody of the child, visitation with the child, and furnishing of bond or other security 
for payment of support. A support order must be for a monthly payment in an amount 
consistent   with   the   guidelines   established   under   section   14-09-09.7   and   must   be 
subject to section 14-09-08.1. All remedies for the enforcement of support, custody, 
and visitation orders apply. The court has continuing jurisdiction to modify an order for 
future support and, subject to section 14-09-09.6, custody of and visitation with the 
child.
Except   as   otherwise   provided   in   subsection 6,   the   court   may   assess   filing   fees, 
reasonable attorney's fees, fees for genetic testing, other costs, and necessary travel 
and   other   reasonable   expenses   incurred   in   a   proceeding   under   sections   14-20-36 
through 14-20-58. The court may award attorney's fees, which may be paid directly to 
the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney's own name.
The court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against the support enforcement 
agency of this state or another state, except as provided by other law.

7. On request of a party and for good cause shown, the court may order that the name of 

the child be changed.
If the order of the court is at variance with the child's birth certificate, the court shall 
order   the  department   of   health  and   human   services  to   issue   an   amended   birth 
registration.
An   order   adjudicating   parentage   must   be   filed   with   the  department   of   health  and 
human services.

14-20-58. (637) Binding effect of determination of parentage.
1.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a determination of parentage is binding 
on:
a.

All   signatories   to   an   acknowledgment   or   denial   of   paternity   as   provided   in 
sections 14-20-11 through 14-20-24; and
All parties to an adjudication by a court acting under circumstances that satisfy 
the jurisdictional requirements of section 14-12.2-04.

b.

b.

A child is not bound by a determination of parentage under this chapter unless:
a.

The determination was  based on an unrestricted acknowledgment  of paternity 
and the acknowledgment is consistent with the results of genetic testing;
The adjudication of parentage was based on a finding consistent with the results 
of   genetic   testing   and   the   consistency   is   declared   in   the   determination   or   is 
otherwise shown; or
The   child   was   a   party   or   was   represented   in   the   proceeding   determining 
parentage by a guardian ad litem.

c.

In   a   proceeding   to   dissolve   a   marriage,   the   court   is   deemed   to   have   made   an 
adjudication   of   the   parentage  of   a  child  if   the   court   acts  under   circumstances   that 
satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of section 14-12.2-04, and the final order:
a.

Expressly identifies a child as a "child of the marriage", "issue of the marriage", or 
similar words indicating that the husband is the father of the child; or
Provides for support of the child, custody of the child, or visitation with the child 
by the husband unless paternity is specifically disclaimed in the order.

b.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a determination of parentage may be a 
defense in a subsequent proceeding seeking to adjudicate parentage by an individual 
who was not a party to the earlier proceeding.
A party to an adjudication of paternity may challenge the adjudication only under law of 
this state relating to appeal, vacation of judgments, or other judicial review.

14-20-58.1. Liability for collection of support.
1.

As   used   in   this   section,   "former   parent"   means   an   acknowledged   father   who 
successfully   rescinded   or   challenged   an   acknowledgment   of   paternity   under   this 
chapter,   a   presumed   father   whose   parentage   was   successfully  rebutted   under   this 

Page No. 13

2.

3.

chapter, or an adjudicated father whose parentage was disestablished after an order 
issued under this chapter was vacated.
The state is not liable for child support that was collected from or on behalf of a former 
parent and disbursed to an obligee as defined in section 14-09-09.10. 
The state is not liable for child support that was collected from or on behalf of a former 
parent and retained by the state unless ordered by a court after being presented with 
genetic test results that would otherwise be admissible under this chapter showing that 
the former parent is not the genetic parent of the child.

14-20-59. (701) Scope.
Sections 14-20-59 through 14-20-65 do not apply to the birth of a child conceived by means 

of sexual intercourse.

14-20-60. (702) Parental status of donor.
A donor is not a parent of a child conceived by means of assisted reproduction.

14-20-61. (703) Paternity of child of assisted reproduction.
A  man   who   provides   sperm   for,   or   consents   to,   assisted   reproduction   by   a   woman   as 
provided in section 14-20-62 with the intent to be the parent of her child, is a parent of the 
resulting child. Parentage of a child born to a gestational carrier is governed by chapter 14-18.

14-20-62. (704) Consent to assisted reproduction.
1. Consent by a woman, and a man who intends to be a parent of a child born to the 
woman by assisted reproduction, must be in a record signed by the woman and the 
man. This requirement does not apply to a donor.
Failure by a man to sign a consent required by subsection 1, before or after birth of the 
child, does not preclude a finding of paternity if the woman and the man, during the 
first two years of the child's life, resided together in the same household with the child 
and openly held out the child as their own.

2.

14-20-63. (705) Limitation on husband's dispute of paternity.
1.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the husband of a wife who gives birth to 
a child by means of assisted reproduction may not challenge his paternity of the child 
unless:
a. Within   two   years   after   learning   of   the   birth   of   the   child   he   commences   a 

b.

proceeding to adjudicate his paternity; and
The court finds that he did not consent to the assisted reproduction, before or 
after birth of the child.

A  proceeding   to   adjudicate   paternity   may   be   maintained   at   any   time   if   the   court

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
