SECTION ONE: 
INFORMATION ABOUT APPEALING A WORKFORCE SAFETY AND 
INSURANCE (WSI) FINAL DECISION TO A NORTH DAKOTA STATE 
DISTRICT COURT 

WHAT IS APPEALING A WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE (WSI) FINAL 
DECISION? 

A Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) claimant may appeal a WSI final decision to a North 
Dakota state district court when: 

• Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) denies a claimant on the ground that the injury

was self-inflicted;

employment;

• WSI denies a claimant on the ground that the accident didn’t arise in the course of

• WSI denies a claimant on any other ground going to the basis of the claim; or

• WSI allows the claimant to participate in the fund to a lesser degree than that claimed
by the claimant, if such allowance is less than the maximum allowance provided by the
Workforce Safety and Insurance Title of the North Dakota Century Code.

The appeal must be in writing and must be filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE 
(WSI) HEARING AND AN APPEAL TO A NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT? 

Administrative Hearing – If you disagree with a Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) decision 
and you want WSI to change their decision, WSI reviews your case for a hearing. 

If Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) still believes its decision is correct, your claim is 
assigned to one of the lawyers who represent WSI in claims disputes. WSI’s lawyer requests 
that the Office of Administrative Hearings appoint an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to conduct 
an evidentiary hearing. 

The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) will hear the facts of your claim and make a 
recommendation to Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) on whether WSI’s decision is 
correct. You must attend the hearing and testify, and you may also bring witnesses or other 
evidence you have which supports your claim.  

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 5 of 30 

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

District Court Appeal – If you disagree with the final decision of the Administrative Law Judge 
(ALJ) after an administrative hearing, you may appeal to a North Dakota state district court. 
While not required, it’s strongly urged that you retain a lawyer for any appeals to District Court. 

You and Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) explain to the court, in writing, your positions 
about how the Administrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) decision based on the administrative hearing 
was incorrect.   

The District Court judge reviews the documents filed by you, the Appellant, and Workforce 
Safety and Insurance (WSI) as part of the appeal.  The judge also reviews the record created 
during the administrative hearing process, including, documents filed for the hearing, evidence 
the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) considered to make their decision, and the transcript of the 
hearing(s).    

Following their review, the District Court judge makes a determination whether the 
Administrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) final decision is supported by the evidence and by the law. 

The District Court judge’s review of the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) decision is based 
only on the record created during the WSI.  The judge doesn’t retry the case, take new 
evidence, or weigh the credibility of witnesses. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE FORMS FOR APPEALING A 
WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE (WSI) FINAL DECISION?

Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) final decision to District Court are found throughout

WHAT DOES THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING IF YOU, 
THE APPELLANT, PROVED YOUR GROUNDS (REASONS) FOR APPEAL? 

The District Court judge’s review of the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) final decision is 
based only on the record created during the WSI proceedings.  The District Court doesn’t retry 
the case, take new evidence, or weigh the credibility of witnesses. 

When reviewing Workforce Safety and Insurance’s (WSI) findings of fact, the District Court 
judge decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined the findings were 
proven by the weight of the evidence from the entire record created during the WSI.   

The conclusions of law in the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) final decision, however, are 
fully reviewable by the District Court judge.

APPEAL, AND 2) SPECIFICATIONS OF ERROR DOCUMENTS WITHIN 30 DAYS 
OF THE FINAL DECISION 

Service is providing copies of your completed Notice of Appeal and Specifications of Error

enough time to file the documents AND proof you served the documents with the District 
Court.  Both service AND filing MUST be completed within the SAME thirty (30) day deadline.

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

Filing Fees 

You, the Appellant, are required to pay a filing fee.   The filing fee for filing an appeal from a 
decision of an administrative agency is $80.00.  You, the Appellant, can find the Fee Schedule at 
ndcourts.gov/district-court/court-fees. 

Petition to Waive Filing Fees and/or Transcript Fees 

If you, the Appellant, are unable to pay the $80.00 filing fee because of financial hardship, you 
may ask the District Court judge may waive, or allow you to not pay, the filing fee.  You may 
also ask the judge to waive the costs of Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) preparing the 
WSI record for the judge to review. 

If you, the Appellant, make a request to the court to waive the $80.00 filing fee, file your 
petition to waive filing fees documents at the same time as the original, completed appeal 
documents.   

Forms and instructions to request a filing fee waiver are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/admin-appeal-to-district-court/fee-waiver.  These forms may also be used to request 
waiver of the cost of preparing the agency record, also called transcript fees.  (See Step Four.) 

Contact information for clerks of court by county is available at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

If the judge assigned to your appeal doesn’t approve your filing fee waiver, you must be 
prepared to pay the $80.00 filing fee.

Specifications of Error documents within the thirty (30) day appeal deadline may result in 
dismissal of your appeal.

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

STEP FOUR: WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE (WSI) PREPARES THE 
RECORD; YOU, THE APPELLANT, PAY WSI’s ESTIMATED COSTS OF 
PREPARING THE RECORD 

Within 30 days of service and filing of the notice of appeal and specifications of error 
documents, Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) will prepare and file either the original or a 
certified copy of the entire record of the WSI proceedings. This timeframe can be extended, but 
requires an order from the judge assigned to the appeal.  

What is included in the record? 

•  The complaint, answer, and other initial pleadings or documents. 
•  Notices of all proceedings. 
•  Any prehearing notices, transcripts, documents, or orders. 
•  Any motions, pleadings, briefs, petitions, requests, and intermediate rulings. 
•  A statement of matters officially noticed.  
•  Offers of proof and objections and ruling thereon.  
•  Proposed findings, requested orders, and exceptions.  
•  The transcript of the hearing prepared for the person presiding at the hearing, including 

all testimony taken, and any written statements, exhibits, reports, memoranda, 
documents, or other information or evidence considered before final disposition of 
proceedings.  

•  Any recommended or proposed order, recommended or proposed findings of fact and 

conclusions of law, final order, final findings of fact and conclusions of law, or findings of 
fact and conclusions of law or orders on reconsideration.  

•  Any information considered pursuant to Section 28-32-25 of the North Dakota Century 

Code. 

•  Matters placed on the record after an ex parte communication.  

Who is responsible for paying the estimated cost of preparing the record? 

You, the Appellant, are required to pay the estimated costs of preparation and filing of the 
entire record of the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) proceedings. 

Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) will notify you, the Appellant, of the estimated costs 
after WSI is served copies of the notice of appeal and specifications of error documents.  You 
pay the estimated costs directly to WSI. 

   

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 23 of 30 

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

What if you, the Appellant, can’t pay the estimated costs of preparing the record? 

You, the Appellant, may ask the court to waive the estimated cost of preparing the record 
based on an inability to pay.  Forms and instructions are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/admin-appeal-to-district-court/fee-waiver. 

If you didn’t make the request when you filed your notice of appeal and specifications of error 
documents, you can file your request to waive transcript fees BEFORE you pay Workforce Safety 
and Insurance’s (WSI) estimated costs of preparing the agency record. 

If the judge assigned to your appeal waives the transcript fees, be prepared to provide a copy of 
the order to Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI). 

If the judge doesn’t waive the transcript fees, you must pay Workforce Safety and Insurance’s 
(WSI) estimated costs of preparing the agency record. 

What if the estimated cost is higher than the actual cost of preparing the record? 

If the actual cost of preparing and filing of the entire record of the Workforce Safety and 
Insurance (WSI) proceeding more than the estimated cost, you, the Appellant, must pay WSI 
the difference. 

You pay the difference directly to WSI. 

What if the estimated cost is lower than the actual cost of preparing the record? 

If the actual cost of preparing and filing of the entire record of the Workforce Safety and 
Insurance (WSI) proceeding is less than the estimated cost paid by you, the Appellant, WSI must 
refund the difference to you. 

IMPORTANT:  Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) won’t began preparing, certifying ,or 
filing the record UNTIL you, the Appellant, have made payment in full of the estimated costs 
or the costs have been waived by an order of the court. 

STEP FIVE: WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE (WSI) FILES THE RECORD; 
THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE ISSUES A SCHEDULING ORDER 

Once service and filing of the notice of appeal and specifications of error, and payment of the 
costs is completed, Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) prepares, certifies and files the 
record with the District Court.  Then, the District Court judge issues a scheduling order with 
timelines for filing legal briefs and requesting oral argument.  

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 24 of 30 

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

STEP SIX: REQUESTING ORAL ARGUMENT 

Carefully review the scheduling order.   

If you, the Appellant, want to request oral arguments, the written request must be made on or 
before your deadline for filing your Appellant brief. 

The District Court judge will decide whether to allow oral arguments.  The judge isn’t required 
to permit oral arguments. 

If the judge allows oral arguments, the arguments are limited to the issues you, the Appellant, 
and Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) included in your legal briefs. 

STEP SEVEN: YOU, THE APPELLANT, PREPARE, SERVE, AND FILE YOUR 
APPELLANT BRIEF 

A very important requirement of the appeal process is the legal brief.  The legal brief may be 
your only opportunity to present your argument to the court.    

What is a legal brief? 

•  A written document filed by a party where the party represents the facts, law and 

argument of how the facts apply to the law. This is the chance for each party to argue 
why Workforce Safety and Insurance’s decision should, or shouldn’t, stand. 

What is the Appellant’s brief? 

•  The Appellant’s brief is a written document explaining why you, the Appellant, are 

appealing the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) final decision and what you think is 
wrong with the decision.  You support your point of view with facts, law and your 
argument of how the facts apply to the law. 

•  Your Appellant’s brief can’t be used to bring any new evidence to the District Court 
judge.  Your Appellant’s brief is limited to the evidence admitted, and evidence 
presented but not admitted, during the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing(s). 

What goes into a brief? 

• 
Issues Presented  
•  Statement of Facts  
•  Law and Argument  
•  Conclusion 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 25 of 30 

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

FIRST, You, the Appellant, Prepare Your Appellant Brief:  

Issues Presented: 

Statement of Facts: 

•  REFER TO YOUR SPECIFICATIONS OF ERROR. 
•  List the same issues you included in your completed Specifications of Error document.  

These are the issues you want the District Court judge to review. 

•  The Statement of Facts is your explanation of the events that led up to the appeal of the 

Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) final decision.  
•  List only specific facts connected to the issues on appeal.  
•  The District Court judge can only consider information that was provided during the WSI 

proceedings. This means you can’t include new facts or evidence that weren’t 
presented during the WSI proceedings.  
If you can, include the specific page or pages in the WSI record where the fact can be 
found.   

• 

Law and Argument: 

•  REFER TO SECTION ONE: WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO 

WORKFORCE SAFETY & INSURANCE (WSI). 
•  REFER TO YOUR SPECIFICATIONS OF ERROR. 
•  You, the Appellant, must research the applicable statutes and case law to build your 

argument that legal errors were made during the WSI proceeding that the District Court 
judge can correct. 

•  The Argument section is where you, the Appellant, apply the law to the facts and tell the 

District Court judge why the decision was wrong. 

•  Address each ground, or reason, you listed in your specifications of error. 
•  Focus on the legal issues and whether the law was correctly applied. 
•  While you may be unhappy with the decision, or think that it contains some minor 

mistakes, this may not mean the decision is legally wrong. 

Conclusion: 

 

•  Briefly tell the District Court judge what you want. 
• 

In other words, how do you want your legal issue, or issues, to be resolved? How do you 
want the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) decision to be resolved?

o  You, the Appellant, file the completed Declaration of Service by Office Delivery

Service When a Lawyer Represents a Party: 

If a lawyer represents a party, serve the lawyer, rather than the party.  

Serving Workforce Safety and Insurance – a State Agency: 

Review Rule 4(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully! 

Service must be made on a state agency by delivering a copy of appeal documents to the 
managing head of the state agency or to the attorney general or an assistant attorney general. 

NOTE:  If you’re unsure who to serve at Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) or at the Office 
of the North Dakota Attorney General, contact the agency directly and ask. 

THIRD, You, the Appellant, File the Following with the Clerk of Court:  

The original, completed Appellant Brief and all original, completed documents showing proof of 
service must be filed with the clerk of court.  

Failure to serve and filed the completed and signed legal brief and declaration(s) of service 
with the Clerk of Court may result in dismissal of your appeal. 

STEP EIGHT: WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE SERVES AND FILES 
THEIR APPELLEE BRIEF 

Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) prepares their Appellee brief, which is the answer to 
your, the Appellant’s, Appellant brief. 

Then, Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) arranges for service of copies their Appellee brief 
on you, the Appellant, and all other parties in the WSI proceeding. 

Finally, Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) files their original Appellee brief and proof of 
service documents with the District Court.

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

STEP NINE: PREPARE FOR ORAL ARGUMENTS, IF REQUESTED AND 
GRANTED  

In an appeal to the District Court, the District Court judge reviews the Appellant and Appellee 
briefs, and the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) record filed with the District Court in Step 
Four.  

However, if oral arguments are requested and granted by the judge, the judge may ask you, the 
Appellant, and Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) to explain your positions in your briefs to 
the court. 

NOTE:  The District Court judge isn’t required to grant oral arguments.  If the judge decides not 
to allow oral arguments for your appeal, the judge decides your appeal based on your Appellant 
brief, Workforce Safety and Insurance’s (WSI) Appellee brief, and the WSI record filed with the 
District Court in Step Four. 

If you’re granted oral arguments, when preparing for oral arguments review your Appellant 
brief, Workforce Safety and Insurance’s (WSI) Appellee brief, and the WSI record filed with the 
District Court. 

Knowing the Governing Law 

If oral arguments are granted, you, the Appellant, will want to be educated on the governing 
law. You, the Appellant, will want to know all the statutes that govern Workforce Safety and 
Insurance (WSI), and the statutes that apply to an appeal of a WSI final decision to District 
Court. 

Statutes can be found at SECTION ONE: What are North Dakota Laws and Rules Related to 
Workforce Safety and Insurance, in your Appellant brief, and in Workforce Safety and 
Insurance’s (WSI) Appellee brief. 

By knowing the relevant law that governs your appeal, you, the Appellant, will be prepared in 
oral arguments if the judge asks you a question regarding the law or if a representative from 
Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) misstates the law. 

Again, it is highly recommended that you, the Appellant, consult an attorney because this is a 
complex issue. 

Knowing Case Law 

In addition to knowing the governing law, you, the Appellant, must know precedent case law 
that helps and hurts your case. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 29 of 30 

Appeal WSI Decision/Rev. Sep 2021 

Precedent case law is when the North Dakota Supreme Court has issued an opinion on the issue 
at hand and the opinion is now the governing case law for Workforce Safety and Insurance 
(WSI) cases.  With this case law, you, the Appellant, will be able to explain to the court how 
your facts are similar or different from that case in order to defend your case. 

In addition, there is persuasive case law that you, the Appellant, may use to make your 
argument stronger.  

Persuasive case law is from another jurisdiction that isn’t governing law for the North Dakota 
state district court or the North Dakota Supreme Court. However, you, the Appellant, could use 
this case law as a way to make your argument stronger by saying that the court in “X” location 
found in favor of your position.  

Presenting Your Oral Argument 

When presenting your argument you, the Appellant, must be respectful to all parties present in 
the court, which includes the lawyer for Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI).  In addition, by 
knowing the governing law and case law, you, the Appellant, will be confident in presenting 
your case to the judge.  When speaking, make a clear and concise argument that shows how 
your facts are similar or different from the governing law at hand.  

STEP TEN: THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE DECIDES THE APPEAL 

In an appeal to the District Court, the District Court judge reviews the Appellant and Appellee 
briefs, and the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) record filed with the District Court in Step 
Four.  Based on this, and oral arguments if requested and granted, the judge makes a 
determination as to whether the Administrative Law Judge’s findings of fact and conclusions of 
law are supported by the evidence and by the law. 

If the order of the agency isn’t affirmed (kept in place) by the District Court judge, it must be 
modified or reversed, and the case returned to Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) for 
disposition in accordance with the judge’s order.  

If the District Court judge doesn’t rule in your favor, you, the Appellant, may appeal the judge’s 
decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court.  If the judge doesn’t rule in Workforce Safety and 
Insurance’s favor, they may appeal the judge’s decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

HOW TO FINISH YOUR APPELLANT’S BRIEF FOR YOUR 
WORKFORCE SAFETY AND INSURANCE (WSI) APPEAL 

ND Legal Self Help Center Staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out forms.  If you’re 
unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer.  

There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  

Don’t include this instruction sheet when you serve or file the completed Appellant’s Brief.  

Page Numbering: 

The bottom of each page of your Appellant’s Brief must be numbered. 

Using the page numbering at the bottom of each page, number the pages of your Appellant’s 
Brief.   

•  Count the total number of pages. 

•  Fill in the blank space next to “Page” at the bottom of each page. 

o  Fill in “1” in the blank space next to “Page” at the bottom of the first page. 

o  Fill in “2” in the blank space next to “Page” at the bottom of the second page. 

o  And so on for each page of your Appellant’s Brief. 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the page number on each consecutive 

page will look like this: “Page 1,” “Page 2,” “Page 3,” “Page 4.” 

Service: 

You must serve copies of your completed Appellant’s Brief on Workforce Safety and Insurance 
(WSI) and all other parties listed as Appellees. 

For information about service, see the Pages 19-21 of the “Appealing a Workforce Safety and 
Insurance Decision” Informational Guide.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
