In  November  2017,  the  Red  River  Rainbow  
Seniors  began 
an  oral  history  project,  
“Breaking  Barriers:  Harvesting  LGBTQ  Stories  
from  the  Northern  Plains,”  focusing  on  older 
LGBTQ  people  and  their  allies.  The  original  
digital  files  and  the  transcriptions  will  be  in  
the  North  Dakota  State  University  Archives.  
Prairie  Public  Radio’s  excerpts  from  some  of 
interviews are available at the podcast.

interviews 

The  Red  River  Rainbow  Seniors  Oral  History 
Committee  has  prepared  a  program  featuring 
excerpts 
in  which  
members  of  this  pioneer  generation  share  their 
stories  of  challenge  and  resilience.  The  State 
Library  is  partnering  with  them  to  bring  this 
moving  and  historically  significant  program 
to  public  libraries  statewide,  starting  in  late  
spring/early summer of 2020.

NEW POLICY FOR KITS

The  North  Dakota  State  Library  has  issued  
a  new  policy  regarding  book  club  and  
STEM  kits.  Due  to  kits  being  returned  late 
or  being  returned  without  all  the  books  or 
pieces,  patrons  will  not  receive  additional 
kits  until  everything  has  been  returned  
from their previous kits.

These  kits  are  on  a  very  tight  schedule  
and  delays  cause  the  kits  to  be  late  to  
their  next  destination.  Please  be  courteous 
and  return  kits  by  the  due  date  with  all  
the materials.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

colleagues  that  have  mentored  me,  laughed  with  
me, supported me, and embraced me. I could not do 
my job successfully without this tribe.

library  associations: 

I  currently 
For  my  various 
belong  to  four  associations;  one  local,  one  regional 
and  two  national. 
I  cannot  begin  to  express 
my  gratitude  for  the  experiences  I’ve  had,  the 
relationships  I’ve  formed,  and  the  friends  that  I 
have  gained  through  these  associations.  I’ve  had 
the  honor  to  serve  on  the  board  of  all  of  these  
associations,  or  the  division  of  one  of  them,  and  
I have learned so much through those experiences.  

or my ND Library Land colleagues: I continue to be  
so impressed by North Dakota librarians and all that 
they  do  to  serve  their  communities.  My  experience 
before  coming  to  North  Dakota  was  primarily  with 
public  and  school  libraries.  I  have  really  enjoyed 
learning about academic libraries and the similarities 
and  differences  with 
types. 
North  Dakota  Libraries  rock,  and  it  is  my  honor 
and  pleasure  to  work  with  all  in  the  North  Dakota  
Library  community.  I  treasure  so  many  colleagues 
that have truly become friends. 

the  other 

library 

For  my  NDSL  crew:  I  am  truly  blessed  to  work  
with  such  a  collegial,  dedicated,  and  caring  staff. 
Customer  service  is  at  the  heart  of  everything  we 
do, and we all strive to serve the Library Community, 
State Government, and the citizens of North Dakota  
in the best way possible.  

or  Kirsten  Baesler  and  the  DPI  team:  I  am  truly  
lucky  to  have  a  boss  that  gets  the  library  world  as 
much  as  Kirsten  does.  The  DPI  team  and  the  NDSL 
team  continue  to  grow  in  the  ways  that  we  work 
together.  I  am  thankful  for  our  colleagues  at  ND  
Vision  Services/School  for  the  Blind  and  ND  School  
for the Deaf as well. 

I  hope  that  you  will  take  some  time  this  month  to 
reflect  on  the  different  things  that  you  are  grateful  
for. I’d love for you to share your #thankfulnovember 
with  me.  If  sharing  on  Facebook  isn’t  your  thing,  
pick up the phone or shoot me an email.

It’s  the  time  of  year  that  we  turn  to  focusing  on 
gratitude. As I’ve shared the last few years, every year 
in  November  I  participate  in  #ThankfulNovember 
on  Facebook  where  each  day  I  post  something 
I’m  grateful  for.  Sometimes,  I  include  pictures  but  
often,  I  don’t.  I  use  a  variety  of  hashtags  but  always 
include  #grateful  and  #thankfulnovember. This  year, 
I’m adding the year to the end of the second hashtag  
to  make  them  easier  to  search.  A  friend  of  mine 
posted  a  list  of  items,  and  each  day  you  share  one  
of  that  category  that  you’re  thankful  for.  The  list 
includes  things  like  people,  pets,  memory,  gadget, 
website/blog,  food;  there  is  one  for  each  day  of  
the  month.  I  thought  about  doing  this  but  had  
already  started  my  traditional  posting.  On  the  one 
hand,  I  like  the  list  as  it  may  force  me  to  focus  on  
things  I  take  for  granted,  but  on  the  other  hand, 
I  really  like  the  free  form  of  posting  whatever 
comes  to  mind  that  day.  As  is  my  norm  now  for  
this  column  in  November,  I’d  like  to  share  my 
#librarygratitude with you. 

For our profession: I am very grateful to have found 
my  vocation  pretty  early  on. This  is  my  25th  year  of 
being  a  librarian  and  I  am  still  grateful  each  day  to  
go  to  work  and  serve.  Libraries  are  one  of  the  last 
spaces  that  serves  all  people  equally  and  that  
doesn’t ask for anything in return to use our facility.  
The  librarians  that  I  know  are  passionate  about 
serving  their  community  and  about  preserving 
the  tenets  of  our  profession:  intellectual  freedom; 
consistent  service  to  all  without  considering  race, 
gender,  socioeconomics,  nationality,  etc.;  equitable 
resource sharing and bridging the digital divide. 

For  my  library  peeps:  my  library  circle  continues  to 
grow.  I  have  so  many  people  that  have  started  as 
colleagues and become friends, and my life is blessed 
beyond  measure  by  my  library  tribe.  I  literally  have 
contacts  in  every  state  and  several  territories  that  I 
can reach out to for just about anything. 

For  my  COSLA  colleagues: When  I  took  the  position  
as  State  Librarian,  it  didn’t  really  dawn  on  me  that  I  
was  joining  an  elite  group  of  56  people,  50  states, 
D.C.  and  4  territories.  I  am  so  grateful  for  those

DIGITAL PUBLIC LIBRARY OF AMERICA

together 

institutions 

from  around 

The  Digital  Public  Library  of  America 
(DPLA) 
the

United  States  to  one  digital  repository  for  users 
just  one 
to  search  thousands  of  records  from 
the

institutions 
website.  DPLA 
Library  of  Congress,  the  Smithsonian,  Harvard 
University,  and  more.  The  North  Dakota  State  
Library is a member of the Big Sky Country Digital Network hub from Montana and has all of our Digital 
Horizons collections included on DPLA. Not only does the State Library contribute, but the State Historical 
Society of North Dakota and Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library also have their collections as part 
of this consortium. 

includes 

Right now, you’re probably thinking so what? Well, the best part of being a member of DPLA is that users 
can search all of the records at once and every item that has to do with their search term will come up. So, 
the records found in North Dakota will be found alongside items from the Library of Congress. With these 
records all being found in one spot, the site drives traffic to North Dakota items and researchers who didn’t 
know that Digital Horizons existed. It is also a great place to start any North Dakota Studies class. You don’t 
need to know which institute to start with. You can search them all, and see what comes up.

If you have any questions about DPLA please email us at ndlstrain@nd.gov. 

BIG CHANGES COMING SOON!

As  some  of  you  may  have  heard,  ODIN  is  changing.  Starting  on  December  11,  2019,  ODIN  
will  officially  split  into  two  different  catalogs.  The  North  Dakota  State  Library,  along  with  
schools  and  public  libraries  that  use  ODIN,  will  migrate  to  III  Polaris,  while  the  academic  
libraries will continue using ExLibris’s ALEPH until they migrate to ExLibris’s ALMA in July 2020. 

Polaris  will  offer  school  and  public  libraries  a  web-based  client  for  patron  services  and 
circulation.  One  of  the  new  features  is  the  ability  to  place  holds  on  other  ODIN  Polaris  
libraries  materials.  With  this  migration  from  ALEPH  to  Polaris,  we’ll  be  featuring  a  new  
public  access  catalog.  Starting  December  11th,  the  PRIMO  interface  will  no  longer  be  
used  for  searching  and  requesting  materials  through  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  or  
other ODIN schools and public libraries catalog. 

Some  find  change  challenging,  and  there  are  always  bugs  to  work  out  when  a  library  
migration  happens,  but,  overall,  you  will  be  happy  with  the  new  catalog.  After  we  are  up  
and  running,  we’ll  be  developing  web-based  tutorials  on  how  to  use  the  new  catalog.  
Also,  feel  free  to  contact  the  Reference  Department  at  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  
(701-328-4622) if you have questions or need assistance.

LIBRARIES AND CENSUS 2020
State Librarian Mary Soucie

In  preparation  of  the  2020  Census,  I  am  a  member  of  the  Education  and  Libraries  Task  Force,  a  
subcommittee  of  the  North  Dakota  Complete  Count  Committee.  The  Committee  is  working  with  the  
Census  Bureau  to  ensure  that  we  have  the  most  complete  count  possible. The  outcome  of  the  census 
impacts  so  many  things  that  we  don’t  even  think  about,  but  some  obvious  ones  are  representation  in 
Congress, education, Medicare, and roads. 

The  Education  and  Library  Task  Force  is  focusing  on  the  populations  that  are  served  by  schools  and  
libraries  as  well  as  the  education  and  library  communities.  We  are  brainstorming  ways  for  those  
communities  to  help  get  the  word  out  about  the  census.  We  are  also  providing  a  work  plan  to  the  
consultant that will be hired to help market the census collection in North Dakota.

The  most  immediate  need,  right  now,  is  to  assist  with 
the hiring of census workers. The U.S. Census Bureau is in  
the  middle  of  a  statewide  recruiting  effort-seeking 
employees to help conduct the 2020 Census. As a public 
space  in  our  communities,  we  are  asking  that  you  make 
your  facilities  available  to  Census  recruiters  who  want  to 
reach  out  to  library  patrons.  This  would  include  setting 
up a table during peak business hours or posting/leaving 
flyers  for  patrons.  Also,  please  considering  using  your 
own  Facebook  Pages  to  share  information  about  the  
2020  Census  and  job  openings.  NDSL  will  be  sharing  
some  ads  with  you  via  our  listservs  as  well  as  the  NDLA  
and Schlibtalk listservs. 

If  you  have  activities  planned  to  promote  the  census,  please  send  them  to  ndslpa@nd.gov  so  we  can  
share them with the Complete Count committee.

NEW CURRICULUM FOR COMMON SENSE EDUCATION
Submitted by Carmen Redding

   

 

NOVEMBER 2019

Common  Sense  has  been  around  since  its  founding  in  2003.  Over  the  past  year,  they  have  redone  
their  website  and  organized  their  curriculum  in  a  more  user-friendly  manner.  If  you  have  not  used  
the  curriculum  in  the  past,  Common  Sense  has  many  free  lessons  K-12,  waiting  for  you  to  explore.  
For those of you who are familiar with Common Sense, you will find updated videos with a professional 
touch.  The  curriculum  remains  basically  the  same.  The  digital  pieces  (Passport  and  Compass)  are  
available for grades 3-8. The digital components for 9-12 have been incorporated into the lessons.

The  curriculum  categories  are  1.  Media  Balance  &  Well-Being,  2.  Privacy  &  Security,  3.  Digital  
Footprint  &  Identity,  4.  Relationships  &  Communication,  5.  Cyberbullying,  Digital  Drama  &  Hate  Speech, 
and  6.  News  &  Media  Literacy.  All  lessons  are  filtered  by  grade.  Once  you  click  on  the  appropriate  
grade,  the  lessons  will  appear.  The  lessons  are  identified  by  category  on  the  top  right.  You  can  then  
move  through  the  categories  to  see  if  additional  lessons  are  available.  The  younger  grades  have  
fewer lessons and the amount increases as you move through the grades.

The  North  Dakota  Department  of  Public  Instruction  has  rolled  out  their  first  ever  Computer  Science 
and  Cybersecurity  Standards.  You  will  be  able  to  meet  many  of  the  standard’s  requirements  for  your  
grade  levels  by  using  Common  Sense  Education.  If  you  have  general  questions  about  Common  Sense,  
click  on  the  Common  Sense  Media  link  to  read  more.  Once  again,  all  these  lessons  are  FREE!  No  
strings attached!

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT:  
HOLIDAY TREAT OR STEM PROGRAM? YOU DECIDE
Submitted by Abby Ebach

ransform  your  usual  holiday  crafting  programs  by  purchasing  some  sugar  and  sprinkles  and  
plugging in a microwave. Teach patrons of all ages to “bake” using nothing but a microwave and 
a mug. Ask participants to bring their own festive mug (but make sure you have spares), and bake  
away  using  any  of  these  fun  Christmas  Cookie  in  a  Mug  recipes.  Not  in  the  mood  to  bake?  
Decorate plain white mugs in a DIY craft or create hot cocoa or other holiday treats “in a jar” for  
your patrons to make at home (or give as a gift).

computational thinking for teens. They are bringing back what they learned to share with librarians  
all over the state. Stay tuned for more information as Bree and Carmen roll out state training after the  
first of the year.

NDSL LAUNCHES 3 NEW DIGITAL COLLECTIONS
Submitted by Trevor Martinson

The State Library has launched three (yes, three!) new digital collections. 

The  Gordon  and  Emma  Anderson  Collection  includes  photos,  documents,  and  objects  relating  to  the 
Anderson and Landers families from the Kenmare and Crosby areas of North Dakota, from the late 1800s to 
the late 1900s.

Prairie  Recipes  includes  cookbooks  and  recipes  from  the  collections  of  institutions  and  private  citizens 
across North Dakota. 

The T.  E.  McMillan  Diaries  is  a  collection  of  diaries  from  1888  to  1947  depicting  the  daily  life  of  a  North 
Dakota homesteader and farmer. 

These new collections, along with the State Library’s other collections, can be accessed online on Digital 
Horizons by anyone from anywhere, completely free of charge. There are currently only a couple items in 
each collection, but more are on the way.

NOVEMBER 2019

By Jessica Robinson

When it gets too cold to venture out, I like to bury 
myself in a cocoon of blankets and try to solve a 
mystery from the comfort of my living room. This 
month,  we’ll  be  looking  at  an  assortment  of  the 
best standalone mysteries that 2019 had to offer, 
and I’ll see if Nancy Drew taught me everything I 
need to know to solve them.

Icy  weather  provides  the  setting  for  Lucy  Foley’s 
The  Hunting  Party  when  a  group  of  old  friends 
go  on  their  traditional  end-of-the-year  vacation,  
all  the  way  to  a  remote  lodge  in  the  Scottish 
Highlands.  Of  course,  they  get  snowed  in  and,  
of  course,  one  of  them  winds  up  dead  on  New 
Year’s Day—but who did it and why?

The  Stranger  Diaries  by  Elly  Griffiths  is  described  
as  a  modern  gothic  mystery,  so  I’m  there  even 
before I hear the plot, but, thankfully, the story is 
intriguing.  Clare  Cassidy  is  a  high  school  English 
teacher with a penchant for a Gothic writer named 
R.M.  Holland  who  used  to  live  in  her  hometown. 
When  a  friend  turns  up  dead  with  a  line  from 
Holland’s  most  famous  story  on  her  body,  Clare 
finds herself living out her curriculum—and failing 
will have deadly consequences. 

Daniel  Sánchez  Arévalo’s  first  translated  novel, 
Alice’s Island, is family drama with a thick coating 
of  mystery  ladled  on  top.  Alice  Dupont  thinks  
she  has  the  perfect  marriage,  right  up  until  
she  gets  a  phone  call  that  her  husband  died 
in  a  car  crash  on  an  island  hundreds  of  miles 
away from their home. Her attempt to figure out 
why  her  husband  was  hiding  a  secret  life  on  the  
island  leads  to  her  creating  a  secret  life  of 
her  own, 
ingratiating  herself  with  the  small  
community  and  transforming  into  a  woman  she 
barely recognizes. 

Anybody  who  knows  me  knows  that  I  would 
put  up  with  all  sorts  of  spooky  nonsense  for  a 
prime  piece of real estate, so I was feeling pretty 
envious  of  the  main  character  in  Lexie  Elliott’s  

The  Missing  Years.  Ailsa  Calder  has  inherited  half  
of  a  beautiful,  eerie  manor  on  the  Scottish 
Highlands—so  far  so  great—and  leaves  noisy 
London  behind  to  settle  the  estate.  Does 
she  have  a  mysterious  half-sister  living  in  the  
manor?  Of  course.  Are  they  visited  by  strange 
nighttime intruders as Ailsa tries to delve deeper 
into her family’s secrets? Obviously! 

There’s  been  buzz  about  our  next  book  since 
early  last  year,  and  it’s  easy  to  see  why.  Denise 
Mina’s  Conviction  explores  the  disintegration  
of  a  young  housewife’s  life  when  her  favorite 
hobby—listening 
true  crime  podcasts—
leads  her  to  a  shocking  revelation:  she  knew  the  
victim  of  one  episode  and  she’s  pretty  sure  she 
knows what actually happened.

By  all  accounts,  South  Korea  is  the  next  country 
to look towards in our insatiable hunger for great 
international  thrillers  and  Un-su  Kim  shows  us 
why  in  The  Plotters,  an  exciting  story  featuring  
an  assassin  raised

Library  of  Dogs  who  finds  an  out  from  his

Finally,  we  end  the  year  with  Alex  North’s  The 
Whisper  Man,  a  terrifying  thriller  about  a  father 
and  son,  Tom  and  Jake,  trying  to  make  a  fresh 
start in what happens to be a famous serial killer’s 
hometown. The Whisper  Man  has  been  in  prison 
for  years,  but  when  a  young  boy  goes  missing  
and  Jake  begins  to  hear  a  strange  whispering  
at  his  window,  Tom  ends  up  embroiled  in  a 
dangerous investigation.

It’s hard to believe it, but the year is almost over, 
and  that  means  it’s  time  to  take  a  look  back  at  
just  exactly  what  2019  has  done  for  us.  Next

novels  and  try  our  best  to  complete  our  reading

UNIVERSAL CLASS COURSE OF THE MONTH: 
ADVERTISING, MARKETING, AND SALES WRITING
Submitted by Angie Houser

One of the hardest parts about any business (libraries 
included)  is  marketing.  If  you  have  never  done  it 
before,  it’s  difficult  to  get  started.  Especially  if  you  
are  unsure  of  who  your  audience  is.  Well,  Universal 
Class  has  a  course  for  that.  Advertising,  Marketing,  
and  Sales  Writing  will  teach  users  how  to  write  
effective and efficient advertising for their business. 
It  will  begin  with  an  overview  and  then  what  not  to  do  in  written  advertising.  It  will  then  go  into  the  
different types of advertising and marketing in order to make you proficient in the field.  

This course has 13 lessons, 27 exams and assignments, and averages around 12 hours to complete. 

If you have any questions email us at ndsltrain@nd.gov. 

All of this is available with a public or State Library card. Check out this course and more today!

LIBRARY LESSONS ALIGNED TO AASL STANDARDS
Submitted by Carmen Redding

Are  you  looking  for  a  book  of  library  lessons?  Better  yet,  are  you  
looking  for  lessons  that  are  aligned  to  the  new  AASL  standards?  
Look  no  further. 
  Librarian,  Maureen  Schlosser,  and  classroom  
teacher,  Rebecca  Granatini,  have  teamed  up  to  give  you  a  book  full  
of  lessons  inspired  by  picture  books.  This  brand  new  paperback  
focuses  on  six  different  picture  books,  one  for  each  of  the  six  
foundations:  inquire,  include,  collaborate,  curate,  explore,  and  engage.  
Each  picture  book  is  used  to  generate  four  cumulative  lessons,  one  
for each of the domains: think, create, share, and grow.

imagination,  these  exercises  could  easily  translate  into  lessons  for  
all  elementary  students.  These  co-authors’  modules  exemplify  the 
art  of  collaboration.  But  most  importantly  for  the  librarian,  these  
lessons  show  the    standards  in  practice,  an  arduous  task  given  the  
depth and complexity of the 2017 standards. 

Your library budget doesn’t have room for professional resources? The North Dakota State Library  
can help you out. We have a copy in our collection, and we can request a copy through interlibrary  
loan.  In  case,  you  are  a  librarian  for  the  older  students,  don’t  feel  left  out.  A  new  book  is  due  out  
this winter for the secondary grades. I’ll share that with you as soon as I can get a copy.

Circulating Tools and Other Unique Items (NDSL) 
Presenter: Janet Anderson, Director of the Minot Public Library
Thursday, November 21 (1:30 PM - 2:00 PM)

Register: http://bit.ly/35rxVZk

Libraries  have  been  circulating  “non-traditional”  items  since  at  least  the  1800s  so  it’s  no  surprise  that  
North  Dakota  libraries  are  embracing  unique  collections.  In  2017,  the  Minot  Public  Library  (MPL)  
was  approached  by  volunteers  with  the  AmeriCorps  VISTA  Program  about  providing  a  tool  library  
and  since  MPL  had  experience  circulating  unique  items  such  as  tablets,  robots,  video  games,  and  
more,  the  library  staff  jumped  on  board.  The  MPL  tool  library  was  not  just  about  being  trendy  
though.  The  goal  of  the  VISTA  program  is  to  promote  resiliency,  and  the  purpose  of  the  tool  library  
is  to  help  people  become  more  resilient  which  was  especially  important  in  Minot  following  the  
2011  flood.  The  MPL  Tool  Library  officially  opened  in  March  of  2018  and  has  drawn  a  lot  of  attention  
and  provided  for  some  great  learning  experiences.  In  this  webinar,  MPL  Director,  Janet  Anderson,  
will  describe  the  work  that  went  into  opening  a  tool  library  and  share  some  of  the  important  lessons  
the staff have learned.

Doing the Work Externally and Internally: Race,

How  does  a  library  respond  to  a  community  in  deep  crisis  around  race  and  social  justice?  That’s  the  
question  that  Richland  Library  in  Columbia,  S.C.,  grappled  with  in  2017.  Recognizing  that  there  was  no  
single  answer,  they  launched  initiatives  on  multiple  internal  and  external  fronts.  Starting  with  a  Social 
Awareness  Taskforce,  geared  toward  community  engagement  and  courageous  conversations,  they  
explored  topics  surrounding  social  and  criminal  justice,  women’s  rights  and  race.  By  using  innovative 
approaches  like  Circles  of  Dialogue  and  mobile  empathy  labs,  nearly  1,500  people  have  participated  in  
the  library’s  race,  equity  and  inclusion  programming.  To  further  their  efforts,  they  have  also  focused 
internally,  empowering  staff  to  lead  the  charge  to  understand  their  biases,  macroaggressions,  and  
cultural  competence  through  Let’s  Talk  gatherings,  Check  Your  Bubble  worksheets,  and  other  effective  
tools.  Hearing  how  Richland  Library  moved  the  needle  on  honest  dialogue,  empathy,  and  equity  with  
their staff and community, you will be inspired to dig in and do the work at your own library.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
