(REPLY FORM 1). 

WARNING: By signing your name you’re telling the Court that you’re telling the truth and that 
you have a good faith reason for your requests. If you aren’t telling the truth, or if you’re 
misleading the Court, or if you’re serving or filing this document for an improper purpose, the 
Court could find you in contempt or you may be prosecuted for perjury. 

STEP 2: 
FILL OUT THE FINANCIAL DECLARATION FORMS (REPLY FORMS 2a, 2b) 

Fill out the Financial Declaration form (Reply Form 2a) and the Confidential Information Form

•  Paycheck stubs or W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses copies of your 

tax returns and schedules  

•  Bank statements

•  Check registers 

To protect your privacy, the other parties, and your child(ren), all social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers listed on papers you file with 
the court must be blackened out (crossed out) completely. Failure to do this means these 
numbers could be available to the general public.

You MUST fill in the name of the City, State and Country where you’re physically located when 
you sign the Financial Declaration (Form 2a).

you have a good faith reason for your requests. If you aren’t telling the truth, or if you’re 
misleading the Court, or if you’re serving or filing this document for an improper purpose, the 
Court could find you in contempt or you may be prosecuted for perjury.  

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FORM (REPLY FORM 2b) 

Court records are generally available to the public, and anyone can request to look in almost 
any court file.  However, certain information is required to remain confidential, even if it is part

(Tech)Rev Aug 2021 

Confidential information includes: 

•  Social security numbers and taxpayer identification numbers 
•  Birthdates 
•  Full name of a minor child 
•  Financial account numbers. 

Since the Financial Declaration (Reply Form 2a) includes references to confidential information, 
you must prepare a Confidential Information form. The form must contain the full confidential 
information that is referenced in the documents. 

FILLING IN THE TOP PART OF THE FORM (this is known as "the caption"): 

Fill in the top part of the form EXACTLY as you filled out the top of the Reply to Motion for 
Review and Amendment of Child Support (Reply Form 1). 

FILLING OUT THE REST OF THE FORM:

account numbers and taxpayer identification numbers.  If you don’t know the information, 
write or type “unknown.” 

“Redacted” Information Column:  Fill in the shortened information as it appears in the 
Declaration for each parent, minor child, financial account numbers and taxpayer identification 
numbers.  If shortened information doesn’t appear in the Declaration, write or type “Not 
Applicable” or “N/A.” 

DATE AND SIGN THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FORM (REPLY FORM 2b). 

WARNING: By signing your name you’re telling the Court that you’re telling the truth and that 
you have a good faith reason for your requests. If you aren’t telling the truth, or if you’re 
misleading the Court, or if you’re serving or filing this document for an improper purpose, the 
Court could find you in contempt or you may be prosecuted for perjury.  

STEP 3: 
GO TO THE CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES CALCULATOR 

The Child Support Guidelines Calculator is located at childsupport.dhs.nd.gov/lawyers/child-
support-guidelines. 

To use the online calculator, you must have access to a computer that has Excel 2007 or a later 
version of Excel. 

CS Review Amend Reply 

Page 6 of 9 

(Tech)Rev Aug 2021 

Read and follow the instructions on the Child Support Guidelines Calculator (The Calculator) 
carefully. When you’re ready to begin, click "Start Calculation". 

Proceed through the screens following the instructions of the calculator as they apply to your 
situation.  When you have finished, print a copy the worksheet and any schedules and attach 
them to the document entitled Brief in Support of Motion for Review and Amendment of Child 
Support. 

The Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services may be able to 
provide limited assistance with your child support calculations. (701-328-5440; 800-231-4255) 
Court personnel and staff of the ND Legal Self Help Center can’t assist with child support 
calculations. 

If you need more assistance than the Child Support Division can provide, retain a lawyer.  

STEP 4: 
MAKE COPIES OF FORMS 

After the forms are completely filled out, make THREE copies of the Reply to Motion for Review 
and Amendment of Child Support form (Reply Form 1)and three copies of your Financial 
Declaration form (Reply Form 2a) and THREE copies of all documents that support your motion 
(for example, paycheck stubs, tax returns, proof of expenses). 

Make ONE copy of the Confidential Information Form (Reply Form 2b) for yourself. 

Keep ONE copy of each form and ONE copy of all supporting documents for yourself (remember 
to bring your copies with you to court on the day of your hearing). 

STEP 5: 
HAVE COPIES OF THE FORMS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS 
SERVED ON THE OTHER PARTY BEFORE THE HEARING DATE 

You must arrange for the other party to receive complete copies of all forms and supporting 
documents you’ve prepared for the hearing. 

This is called "service of process." 

A copy of the Reply to Motion for Review and Amendment of Child Support (Reply Form 1), 
Financial Declaration (Reply Form 2a), and supporting documents must be served upon all 
parties by mail.  If a party is represented by an attorney, the forms and supporting documents 
must be served on the attorney instead of the party. 

CS Review Amend Reply 

Page 7 of 9 

(Tech)Rev Aug 2021 

NOTE: DON’T mail a copy of the Confidential Information Form (REPLY FORM 2b). 

The envelopes containing the forms and supporting documents must be mailed to the other 
party (or his/her attorney if there is one) before the hearing date. 

WARNING: If your forms and supporting documents aren’t served upon the other party 
within 17 days of service of the Notice of Motion and Motion for Review and Amendment of 
Child Support, the court may assume that you agree with the requests the other party made 
in their motion documents.  

STEP 6: 
FILL OUT THE "DECLARATION OF SERVICE BY MAIL" FORM (REPLY FORM 3) 

When you mail the forms and supporting documents, you must fill out a "Declaration of Service 
by Mail" form (Reply Form 3) for each party served. 

You MUST fill in the name of the City, County, State and Country where you’re physically 
located when you sign the Declaration of Service by Mail (Reply Form 3). 

WARNING: By signing your name you’re telling the Court that you’re telling the truth. If 
you’re not telling the truth, or if you’re misleading the Court, or if you’re serving or filing this 
document for an improper purpose, the Court could find you in contempt or you may be 
prosecuted for perjury. 

After it has been completed and signed, make one copy of the Declaration of Service by Mail for 
your records. 

STEP 7: 
FILE THE FORMS WITH THE CLERK OF COURT 

The following original documents must be filed with the clerk of court in the county where your 
case is located as soon as practical but no later than 5 days before the scheduled hearing. 

•  Original of completed Reply to Motion for Review and Amendment of Child Support 

form (Reply Form 1); 

•  Original of completed Financial Declaration form (Reply Form 2a); 
•  Original of completed Confidential Information Form (Reply Form 2b); and 
•  Originals of completed "Declaration of Service by Mail" (Reply Form 3), if any. 

Court Fees: You must be prepared to pay a filing fee at the time you file this motion.  The filing 
fee is $30.00. 

CS Review Amend Reply 

Page 8 of 9 

(Tech)Rev Aug 2021 

Petition to Waive Court Fees: If you can’t afford to pay the filing fee, you may qualify to have it 
waived by the court. 

You need to fill out a Petition for Waiver of Fees (available from the Clerk of Court or the North 
Dakota Supreme Court website at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver) and file it with the 
Clerk of Court. 

Your application will be reviewed by a judge who will decide whether you must pay the fee. If 
the judge doesn’t sign an order that waives the fee, you must be prepared to pay the fee or the 
clerk can’t accept your forms.  

STEP 8: 
APPEAR AT THE HEARING 

Come to court on the date and time scheduled for the hearing. 

Be sure to bring with you your copy of the Reply to Motion for Review and Amendment of Child 
Support (Reply Form 1) and Financial Declarationf (Reply Form 2a) and all of your supporting 
documents. 

You must bring enough copies of any supporting documents not already filed with the court or 
served on all the parties so that a copy can be given to all parties and the court if you want the 
court to consider your supporting documents.
