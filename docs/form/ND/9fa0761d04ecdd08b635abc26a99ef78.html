INSTRUCTIONS FOR BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FORM 

ND Legal Self Help Center Staff and Court employees cannot help you fill out forms.  If you are 
unsure how to proceed, you should consult a lawyer. 

There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  Use at your own risk. 

Do not include these instruction sheets when you serve or file your completed brief in 
support of your motion. 

The “Motion” Section of the GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION on the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website has additional information and resources. 

A Brief in support of motion is one of a set of required documents that make up a written 
motion: 

•  Notice of Motion; 
•  Motion; 
•  Brief in Support of Motion; 
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion; and 
•  Other supporting documents. 

A Brief in support of motion is a written explanation of why you, the moving party, should have 
your motion granted. 

A Brief takes the rules and laws that support your request and explains how they apply to the 
facts of your particular situation. 

Facts referred to in the Brief must also appear in your affidavit in support of the motion. 

Research North Dakota court laws and rules.  A motion must include the legal authority that 
supports the motion request.  Any motions to the court must refer to the laws, North Dakota 
Supreme Court case law, and court rules, or a combination of all three, upon which the motion 
is filed.  The Brief in support of the motion explains how and why the law, case law, or court 
rule supports the request.  

(The North Dakota Century Code, and North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and North Dakota 
court rules are also found in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries.) 

  The North Dakota Century Code is found online at www.legis.nd.gov/general-

information/north-dakota-century-code.  The Century Code contains the laws enacted 
by the North Dakota Legislature. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help”

Motion Brief/Rev Mar 2019 

 

  North Dakota Supreme Court case law is found online at www.ndcourts.gov/.  When 
the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why 
they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way they did.  The opinions are 
case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts 
and issues. 
 

  North Dakota court rules are found online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.  

Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is 
conducted. 

This form is not a fillable form.  To create your legal document using this form, you have at 
least two options: 

Option One: Print this form on 8 ½” x 11” paper and hand-write your brief in support of 
motion.  Your hand-writing must be easily readable.  Black ink is preferred. 

Option Two: Copy and paste the Brief in Support of Motion sections into a word 
processing program, for example, Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, Google Docs, or 
OpenOffice.  Use this form and these instructions as your guide to format your legal 
document.

Statement of Facts: 

Law and Argument:  

  List the facts that caused you to decide to file a motion in the civil action.  List only the 

facts that are relevant to the motion. 

  These facts must also be included in your Affidavit in Support of Motion.  You will create 

a separate legal document as your Affidavit in Support of Motion. 

  From your legal research, explain how each law, case law, or court rule you have 

identified supports your motion. 

  Apply each law, case law, or court rule you have identified to the facts you listed in the 

Statement of Facts. 

  If you identified laws, case laws, or court rules that do not support your motion, explain 

why the court rule, law or case law does not apply to your motion. 

Conclusion:  

Date and Signature: 

  Summarize what you are asking the court to do and why the court should grant your 

motion.  This is generally a short paragraph. 

  The date and signature are at the end of your brief in support of motion. 

  If you copied and pasted the Signature section into a word processing program, format 

your signature section as close as you can to the Signature section of the form. 

  If the party making the motion is self-represented, the self-represented party must date 

and sign the brief in support of motion. 

If the party making the motion is represented by a lawyer, the lawyer must date and 
sign the brief in support of motion. 

WARNING: By signing your name you are telling the Court that you are telling the truth 
and that you have a good faith reason for your requests. If you are not telling the truth, 
if you are misleading the Court, or if you are serving or filing this document for an 
improper purpose, the Court could find you in contempt or you may be prosecuted for 
perjury.

identification number.

Service: 

n general, copies of documents filed, or intended to be filed, with the court must be provided 
to the other parties in the civil action.  This is called service. 

here are specific requirements for serving documents after a civil action has started.  Rule 5 of 
the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the requirements for service after a civil action 
has started. 

roof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 

with the court until proof of service is filed. 

or information about service and proof of service in a civil action, go to the Service link on the 
ND Legal Self Help Center website. 

Do not include these instruction sheets when you serve or file your completed brief in 
support of your motion.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
