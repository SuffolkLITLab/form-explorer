SECTION ONE gives general information about petitioning to award title 
to a motor vehicle. (Pages 2 - 6) 

SECTION TWO gives information about the basic petition process from 
beginning to end.  (Pages 7 - 11) 

SECTION ONE: 

INFORMATION ABOUT PETITIONING A NORTH DAKOTA STATE 
DISTRICT COURT TO AWARD TITLE TO A MOTOR VEHICLE 

 

OVERVIEW 

When an individual is unable to obtain title to a motor vehicle through the process set out by 
the North Dakota Department of Transportation, the individual may petition a North Dakota 
state district court to award title to the motor vehicle. 

The individual petitioning the North Dakota state district court must prove the steps they took 
to obtain title and prove their ownership of the motor vehicle. 

The information in this guide covers the basic process of petitioning a North Dakota State 
District Court to award title to a motor vehicle. 

If your circumstances are complex, or you are not sure if this is the appropriate court process 
for your circumstances, consult an attorney who can agree to represent you for assistance. 

CONTACT THE NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORATION

Transportation for information on their process for obtaining title to a vehicle.  You may be able

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE PETITION TO AWARD TITLE TO A 
MOTOR VEHICLE FORMS? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center does not have a packet of forms for petitioning a North 
Dakota state district court to award title to a motor vehicle.  If you decide to represent 
yourself, you will need to create and prepare your own legal documents.  Names and 
descriptions of the documents you will need to create and prepare are found throughout this 
guide. 

Although the ND Legal Self Help Center does not have forms or instructions for petitioning a 
North Dakota state district court to award title to a motor vehicle, a variety of General-Use 
forms are available in the Guide to a Civil Action.  You may find the General-Use forms of 
interest as a starting point for creating your own legal documents. 

The Guide to a District Court Civil Action is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by 
clicking on the "Guide to a District Court Civil Action" link under “District Court Civil”.  A link to 
the General-Use forms are located at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/general-use-forms 

Formatting examples of some of the documents you will need to create and prepare are 
available at the end of this guide. 

IS THERE HELP AVAILABLE FOR CREATING LEGAL DOCUMENTS? 

If you would like assistance creating your legal documents, consult a lawyer licensed to practice 
in North Dakota.  Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to 
practice in North Dakota may agree to help you with part of your civil action, such as preparing 
legal documents, while you handle the rest of your civil action.  You and the lawyer must agree 
in writing to Limited Legal Representation. 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court system staff cannot assist you with creating or 
preparing your legal documents. 

WHO ARE THE PARTIES IN A PETITION TO AWARD TITLE TO A MOTOR VEHICLE? 

Petitioner – The individual(s) making the request.  The Petitioner starts the civil action by 
serving a summons and petition on the Respondent(s).

•  For example, if petition the court to order the North Dakota Department of

WHAT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TERMS IN A 
PETITION TO AWARD TITLE TO A MOTOR VEHICLE? 

Department – The North Dakota Department of Transportation.  

Motor Vehicle (Chapter 39-01) – In North Dakota Century Code Chapter 39-01: Definitions and 
General Provisions, “motor vehicle” includes every vehicle that is self-propelled, every vehicle 
that is propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but not operated 
upon rails, and, for purposes of motor vehicle registration, title registration, and operator's 
licenses, motorized bicycles. The term does not include a snowmobile. 

Motor Vehicle (Chapter 39-05) – In North Dakota Century Code Chapter 39-05: Title 
Registration, “motor vehicle” also includes a housetrailer or mobile home and a semitrailer 
designed to be towed by a truck tractor, unless the context or subject matter requires 
otherwise. 

Venue - The location (county court) in which the North Dakota state district court will hear the 
civil action. 

WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO PETITIONING TO 
AWARD TITLE TO A MOTOR VEHICLE? 

Chapter 28-04 of the North Dakota Century Code www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c04.html 
governs which North Dakota state district court may hear the petition, which is referred to as 
called venue.  Review the Chapter to determine where to file the summons and petition. 

Chapter 39-05 of the North Dakota Century Code www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t39c05.html 
governs title registration. 

•  See Section 39-05-20 for laws related to obtaining a new title when unable to obtain the 

old title. (www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t39c05.pdf#nameddest=39-05-20) 

Chapter 37-12-04 of the North Dakota Administrative Code 
www.legis.nd.gov/information/acdata/pdf/37-12-04.pdf contains the administrative rules 
enacted by the North Dakota Department of Transportation related to the Department’s

The North Dakota Rules of Court apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Title to Vehicle/Rev Mar 2019 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev. 

North Dakota Case Law is useful for interpreting what the law means for your individual 
circumstances.  When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota State District 
Court to the North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain 
how and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The 
opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar 
facts and issues. 

One way to research case law related to awarding title to a motor vehicle, is to use the print 
version of the North Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each 
Section of the Century Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of 
the Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click 
on the “Opinions” link under “Supreme Court” and enter the case name or case citation. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rules and rulings, and case law.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, administrative 
rules and rulings, and case law.  Notes of case law related to North Dakota law can be found in 
the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

You are not required to hire a lawyer to bring a civil action in North Dakota State District Court.

•  The State Bar Association of North Dakota provides a lawyer referral service to match 
paying clients in need of legal services with lawyers.  The phone number is (866) 450-

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that a lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled. 

For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

SECTION TWO: 

THE PETITION PROCESS IN NORTH DAKOTA 

STEP ONE: GATHER YOUR DOCUMENTATION 

Gather your documentation to include as exhibits to your petition.  

At minimum, you must prove the following to the North Dakota state district court: 

•  The steps you took to obtain title to the motor vehicle; and 
•  Your ownership of the motor vehicle. 

You make all decisions about how to prove the steps you took to obtain title and how to prove 
your ownership of the motor vehicle.  The ND Legal Self Help cannot advise you.  If you need 
assistance, consult with a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who can agree to 
represent you. 

Make a copy of your documentation and type or write an exhibit identifier on each copy. 

For example, Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C.  When you refer to your documentation in your 
petition document, include the name you gave the Exhibit. 

Make copies of your marked exhibits to serve on each Respondent in Step Three. 

STEP TWO: CREATE AND PREPARE YOUR LEGAL DOCUMENTS 

Determine the Respondent(s): 

The Respondent (or Respondents) is the person (or persons) against whom the petition is 
brought.  The Respondent (or Respondents) may also be the person (or persons) you are asking 
the court to order to do something. 

You determine who to list as Respondent(s) on the documents.  The ND Legal Self Help Center 
cannot advise you. 

Prepare the Summons: 

A summons directs the Respondent (or Respondents) to answer the petition within a certain 
amount of time. The summons notifies the Respondent (or Respondents) that a default 
judgment will be taken against them if the Respondent (or Respondents) does not answer. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 7 of 12 

Title to Vehicle/Rev Mar 2019 

An example of a summons is found at the end of this Informational Guide.  Instructions for 
preparing a summons are included with the example. 

Leave the “case number” blank.  If your completed documents are accepted for filing by the 
clerk of state district court, a case number will be assigned.  (See Step Four) 

Create the Petition to Award Title to a Vehicle: 

A petition is a written request for an order granting the relief the Petitioner is seeking.  The 
petition describes in short, plain statements that the Plaintiff is entitled to relief, and includes 
the request, or requests, for relief. 

At minimum, the petition must include the following: 

•  Statements of subject matter jurisdiction of the state district court and personal 
jurisdiction of the state district court over the persons named in the petition. 

o  Subject matter jurisdiction: The specific law(s) and/or that relate to the subject 
of the petition that give the state district court authority to hear and determine 
the petition. 

o  Personal jurisdiction: How the state district court has authority over each of the 
persons named in the petition. (See Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.) 

•  Statement of why the county is the proper venue for the petition. 

•  Statements of the reasons you are bringing the petition, the steps you took to obtain 
title and why the state district court should award you title to the motor vehicle. 
Include references to your documentation by using the exhibit letters you 
assigned when you marked the exhibits in Step One. 

o 

•  Requests for relief, also called demands for relief. 

o  Tell the court what you want the court to do. 

•  Dated and signed by you, the Petitioner. 

o  Directly following your signature, write or type your printed name, address and 

phone number. 
If your mailing and street addresses are different, include both. 

o 

•  Your verification of the correctness, truth or authenticity of the petition. 

o  Your notarized verification statement comes after the date and signature block 

on the petition. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 8 of 12 

Title to Vehicle/Rev Mar 2019 

You may find two general-use forms useful as a starting point for creating your petition.  The 
general-use forms are found under “District Court Civil” at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

•  Caption and Signature (Petition) Form 
•  Verification (Petition) Form 

A formatting example of a petition to award title to a vehicle is found at the end of this 
Informational Guide. The example petition is included only as a formatting example. The ND 
Legal Self Help Center does not guarantee or certify its accuracy or legal sufficiency.  Use at 
your own risk. 

Make Copies of the Completed Documents: 

Make a copy of the completed summons and petition for each Respondent you listed in the 
summons and petition. 

You must serve the copy of the summons and petition on each Respondent in Step Three. 

Make a copy of the completed summons and petition for your records. 

STEP THREE: SERVE COPIES OF THE PETITION DOCUMENTS ON EACH 
RESPONDENT 

Each Respondent you listed on the petition must be served with one copy of the following 
completed documents: 

•  Summons 
•  Petition 
•  Exhibits (if any) 

You must provide proof of service for each Respondent to the state district court. 

A completed, signed and notarized affidavit of service from the person who served the 
documents is your proof of service.  If you do not provide proof of service to the state district 
court, the court will not act on your petition. 

You will file proof of service in Step Four. 

For information about the requirements and process for serving a summons and petition to 
start a civil action, including blank affidavit of service forms, click on the “Service Instructions 
and Forms” link at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action.  Carefully review 
the service information to start a civil action in this section. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 9 of 12 

Title to Vehicle/Rev Mar 2019 

If You are Unable to Locate a Respondent for Service: 

If you, after making diligent efforts to locate a Respondent for service of the summons and 
petition, are unable to locate the Respondent, service by publication may be available. 

Service by publication is not allowed in every type of court case. 

For information about the requirements and process for service by publication to start a civil 
action, click on the “Service Instructions and Forms” link at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/service-in-a-civil-action.  Review the service by publication information in this section. 

Respondents Have 21 Days from Service to Respond to the Petition: 

Each Respondent has 21 days from the date they were served the copy of the summons, 
petition and exhibits (if any) to respond to or “answer” the petition.  An answer is a written 
response by a Respondent to your petition to award title to a motor vehicle. 

STEP FOUR: FILE THE ORIGINAL PETITION DOCUMENTS WITH THE CLERK OF 
STATE DISTRICT COURT 

***Filing a document is not the same as serving a document. 
Filing does not meet the requirements of service.  Proof of service of the document(s) must be 
filed with the court.*** 

The originals of the following completed documents are filed with the clerk of state district 
court: 

•  Summons 
•  Petition 
•  Exhibits (if any) 
•  Proof of Service on Each Respondent 

If the clerk of state district court accepts your documents for filing, the clerk will assign a case 
number. 

You will be required to pay an $80.00 filing fee.  Confirm the amount with the clerk of court.  
Contact information for clerks of court by county may be found at www.ndcourts.gov under 
“District Courts”. 

Forms and instructions for asking the court to waive the $80.00 filing fee can be found at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Title to Vehicle/Rev Mar 2019 

STEP FIVE: AFTER THE PETITION IS FILED 

After the petition is filed, the case is assigned to a judge.  The judge reviews the documents 
filed in the case and makes decisions. 

You May be Required to Provide Additional Information to the Court: 

After reviewing the documents you filed, the judge may require you to provide additional 
information before the court will act on your petition.  It is up to you to follow up on anything 
the court requires you to do. 

The Judge May Decide your Petition Based Only on the Documents Filed: 

After reviewing the documents you and any Respondents filed, the judge may grant or deny 
your petition without holding an in-person hearing. 

The Judge May Decide to Hold an In-Person Hearing: 

After reviewing the documents you and any Respondents filed, the judge may decide to hold an 
in-person hearing before deciding whether to grant or deny your petition. 

If the judge decides to hold a hearing, the court notifies you in writing of the date, time and 
location of the hearing. 

At the hearing, you, the Petitioner, must prove the information you provided in your petition.   

Each Respondent may present evidence to disprove the information you provided in your 
petition. 

Caution! Preparing for a hearing is often a complex and confusing process.  You are held to the 
same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or 
procedures.  You will need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

At minimum, review and research the laws and rules listed above.  You will use the North 
Dakota Rules of Evidence, in particular, to present your evidence and object to each 
Respondent’s evidence. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

     

NDLSHC Info Guide

Title to Vehicle/Rev Mar 2019 

If Your Petition is Dismissed: 

Review the order dismissing your petition. 

If your petition is dismissed with prejudice, you cannot re-file the petition. 

If your petition is dismissed without prejudice, you may re-file the petition at a later date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
