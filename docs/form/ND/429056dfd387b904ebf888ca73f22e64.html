STEP 3: 

FILE THE ORIGINAL, COMPLETED MOTION FORMS WITH THE JUVENILE COURT. 

Before filing the original, completed forms with the Juvenile Court: 

•  Make a copy of each completed form for each party in the Juvenile Court proceeding.  

Make an additional copy for your records. 

•  Contact the Juvenile Court and ask if the court will accept your motion forms for filing 

BEFORE you serve copies on the parties in the Juvenile Court proceeding. 

o 

o 

If the court will file your motion forms before you serve copies on the parties, 
continue with Step 3. 

If the court won’t file your motion forms before you serve copies on the parties, 
complete Step 4 first.  Once you have completed Step 4, complete Step 3. 

Take the original, completed forms to the Juvenile Court where the petition was accepted for 
filing: 

•  Notice of Motion for an Order for Service by Publication (JCt NoM Svc Pub); 

•  Motion for an Order for Service by Publication (JCt Mot Svc Pub); 

•  Brief in Support of an Order for Service by Publication (JCt Brief Svc Pub);

STEP 4: 

SERVE COPIES OF THE COMPLETED MOTION FORMS ON THE OTHER PARTIES IN 
THE JUVENILE COURT PROCEEDING.   

Service means giving a copy of each of the completed motion forms from Step 2 to the parties 
in the Juvenile Court proceeding. 

Unless the Juvenile Court orders otherwise, you won’t serve copies of motion forms on the 
party you haven’t been able to locate. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process and the document(s) showing proof of 
service must be filed with the Juvenile Court.  If proof of service isn’t filed, the Juvenile Court 
won’t act on your motion until you show that the parties in the Juvenile Court proceeding were 
served copies of the motion forms. 

Review Rule 7 of the N. D. Rules of Juvenile Procedure.  Rule 7 includes the six different 
methods to serve motion documents. You must decide which of the methods to use.  No 
matter which method you choose, you must prove to the Juvenile Court that copies of the 
motion forms were served as required by Rule 7. 

The three most common methods of service of a motion are described below. 

1.  By Mail: 

If you decide to serve copies of the completed motion forms on a party by mail, you 
must: 

a.  Have someone who is at least 18 years of age mail copies of the following 

completed forms to the party: 

i.  Notice of Motion for an Order for Service by Publication (JCt NoM Svc 

ii.  Motion for an Order for Service by Publication (JCt Mot Svc Pub); 
iii.  Brief in Support of an Order for Service by Publication (JCt Brief Svc Pub); 
iv.  Affidavit in Support of an Order for Service by Publication (JCt Aff Svc 

Pub); 

Pub); and 

v.  Order for Service by Publication (Proposed) (JCt Ord Svc Pub). 

Copies of the completed forms are mailed to the last known address of the 
party.  Service is complete upon mailing.

STEP 5: 

AFTER THE MOTION FORMS ARE FILED AND SERVED. 

Each party has 14 days to respond to the motion.   

This doesn’t include the day of service.  If a party responds to your motion, the party states in 
writing whether they agree or disagree with your motion for an order for service of the Juvenile 
Court summons by publication. 

The judicial referee or judge assigned to your motion may decide to schedule a hearing, or to 
make a decision without a hearing. 

If the judicial referee or judge decides to hold a hearing, you’ll be notified by mail.  If the judicial 
referee or judge decides to make a decision without a hearing, you’ll receive copies by mail of 
documents signed by the judicial referee or judge.  The documents will tell you what the judicial 
referee or judge decided. 

IF YOUR MOTION IS GRANTED 

Review Rule 4(e) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for service by publication 
requirements.  Rule 4 is available online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp/4. 

Contact the official newspaper for the county where you’ll publish service of the summons.  
You’ll need to publish the redacted summons one time per week for three consecutive weeks. 

To redact the summons, remove the following information: 

•  Full names of the child, or children, and all parties.  Leave only the initials of the child, or 

children, and all parties. 

•  Full date of birth of the child, or children.  Leave only the year of birth. 

The hearing can’t be held earlier than five days after the date of the last publication.
