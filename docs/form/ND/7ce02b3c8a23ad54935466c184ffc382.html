      <pre>Instructions for Requests to Prohibit Public Access to a Defendant’s 
Court Case Records in a Criminal Case – Dismissed or Acquitted    

Important! Read Before Using These Forms and Instructions 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. Carefully read 
this information and any instructions to which you’re referred. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. If you’re unsure if these forms and instructions suit your 
circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

For information about how to find a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer. 

As a self-represented individual, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to North Dakota state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
process for motioning a North Dakota state district court to prohibit public access to a defendant’s 
court case record because the criminal charges were dismissed or the defendant was acquitted. 
There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal 
Self Help Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms 
or information provided. Use at your own risk. 

No Assistance with Court Process in Criminal Cases 

The ND Legal Self Help Center gives information about the court process in civil cases only. The 
ND Legal Self Help Center can’t give assistance with court process in criminal cases and doesn’t 
have expertise available in this area.

What Rules Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet? 

Rule 41, Section 4(a) of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules governs requests 
to prohibit public access to a defendant’s court record in a criminal case in North Dakota. 

•  Rule 41, Section 4(a)(7) governs requests to prohibit access to electronic court case 
records when a defendant’s criminal charges were dismissed or the defendant was 
acquitted in the criminal case. 

Rule 47 of the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure governs motions in a criminal case in 
North Dakota. 

Rule 3.2 of the North Dakota Rule of Court also governs motions in a criminal case in North 
Dakota. 

Rule 3.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court is the rule that applies to protecting information in 
documents filed in North Dakota state district court cases. 

Who May Use this Packet? 

1.  An individual who has been charged with a criminal offense (also called the Defendant) 

and: 

AND 

a.  The charges were dismissed; or 
b.  The individual was acquitted; 

2.  The individual wants to ask a North Dakota state district court to prohibit public access 
to all of the case records in their criminal case, including prohibiting public access to 
electronic case records. 

This Packet DOESN’T Expunge (Delete) Criminal Records 

Even if public access to all or part of an individual’s criminal court case records is prohibited by 
the district court, the court’s order doesn’t delete (expunge) the information from the court 
case record or the records kept by any other government entity or private entity. 

If the district court orders the entire case to be prohibited from public access, the court may 
order access to the case records upon request. (The request is made by written motion under 
Rule 41, Section 4(b) of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules.)

You may wish to research expungement more yourself or consult a lawyer for options.

know if you should use these forms, consult a lawyer who is licensed to practice in North 
Dakota and can agree to represent you. 

When you sign the forms, your signature tells the Court that you: 

•  Made reasonable inquiries about the motion requirements; and  
•  Based on your inquiries, to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief: 

o  You are not presenting the motion for any improper purpose, such as to harass, 

cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;

by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or 
reversing existing law or for establishing new law; 

o  The facts you present in the motion are supported by evidence or will likely have 
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or 
discovery; and

See North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11 for signature requirements, representations 
to the Court, and sanctions for motions and other documents presented to a Court. 

Request copies of the court case records in the case in which you want to limit public access.  
If your request is granted by the state district court, you may not be able to get copies of the 
case records without making a new, written request for access. Contact the Clerk of Court’s 
office in the North Dakota county that heard your case to request copies of the records. 

Consider requesting at least one certified copy of the case records, as well. 

Including Protected Information When you Fill Out the Forms 

When you file this motion with the North Dakota state district court, all documents, except 
the Confidential Information Form, are available to the public to view.   

Court case records are generally available to the public, and anyone can request to look in 
almost any court file. However, certain information is protected and required to remain 
confidential, even if the protected information is part of a public court case record. 

Protected Information is: 

•  Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. 
•  Birthdates. 
•  Minor child’s name. 
•  Financial account number. 
•  Victim contact information in a criminal or delinquency case, if the victim requests. 

o  Victim contact information means any information that would allow someone to 

make contact. Contact information includes, but isn’t limited to, names, 
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or places of employment. 

You may need to refer to Protected Information when you fill out the forms. When you fill 
out the forms, write or type ONLY: 

•  The last four (4) digits of the social security number and taxpayer identification number. 
•  The year of birth. 
•  The minor child’s initials. 
•  The last four (4) digits of the financial-account number. 
•  “Victim contact information” to refer to victim contact information in a criminal or 

delinquency case.

Limit Public Access Inst/Rev Nov 2022 

The district court still needs to have access to the full Protected Information. Complete the 
Confidential Information Form with the full Protected Information you reference in the rest of 
the forms. 

The Confidential Information Form is filed as a confidential document and isn’t available to the 
public to view. 

If Your Request to Prohibit Public Access is Granted 

If the North Dakota state district court grants your request to prohibit public access to your 
court case records in your criminal case, people can still search publically available court 
records by your name or case number. 

The public search results will look similar to this: 

Doe 

Jon 

Alan 

0000 

After clicking on the Case Number, the Register of Actions for your case(s) will look similar to 
this: 

Doe 

Jon 

Alan 

80 

Your name, city, state, zip code and year of birth remain publically available. 

However, the listing of case records and events in your case is replaced with “Internet Access is 
Prohibited under N.D. Supreme Court Admin. Rule 41 – For more information see 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndsupctadminr/41.”

STEP 4: Review of the Court   

If the Motion is Granted 

If the Court decides there are reasonable grounds to prohibit public access, the Judge will sign a 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. 

The Clerk of Court will be instructed by the order to restrict public access to the case records in 
the matter and ensure that public search results for the case records displays the words 
“Internet Access Prohibited under N.D.Sup.Ct.Admin.R 41.”   

If the Motion is not Granted  

If the Court determines that there aren’t reasonable grounds to prohibit public access, the 
Court will issue an Order denying the motion and the records will remain open to public access.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
