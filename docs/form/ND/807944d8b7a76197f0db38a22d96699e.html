      <pre>Preparing For Your Small Claims Court Hearing 

If the Defendant requests a hearing within their 20 day deadline, both the Plaintiff and the Defendant must 
attend the hearing and tell their side. (Only the Defendant can request a hearing.)

You won’t have a lot of time to tell your side. 

Witness testimony as evidence. 

Small Claims Court hearings are usually set for 30 
minutes total. You might have only 10-15 minutes 
to present your side at the hearing. 

•  Make your time count! Be prepared before 

you go to Small Claims Court.  

o  Don’t waste precious time at the 
hearing organizing and marking 
exhibits, organizing your notes, etc. 

• 

If the entire case can’t be heard within this 
timeframe, the judicial officer may dismiss 
the Small Claims case and tell you to handle 
it in District Court. 

At least 1 week BEFORE the hearing, make an 
outline of your side and your evidence. 

•  Make a typed or written outline of your side 
and your evidence to support your side. 

•  Tell your side in order of events – don’t skip 

around. 

•  State your facts clearly and concisely. 

Facts   Evidence 
1. __    Receipt 
2. __    Witness 
3. __    Text 1 
4. __    Text 2 

o  Facts can be proven true or false, 
such as who, what, when, where, 
and how. “I live in North Dakota.” 
o  Avoid opinions.  An opinion is a view 
or belief that can’t be proven true or 
false. “North Dakota is the best state 
ever.” 

•  Next to or directly following each fact, list 
your evidence that supports the fact.  
Generally, evidence is: 

o  Testimony from witnesses with 

first-hand knowledge of an event. 
o  Exhibits, which could be any papers, 
legal documents, photographs, or 
other physical evidence supporting a 
claim. 

Witnesses must have first-hand knowledge of the 
events, or the exhibit, to which they will testify.  
Keep in mind that you, the Plaintiff or Defendant, 
may be a witness. 

Witnesses must come to the hearing. 

Out-of-court statements, also called hearsay 
evidence, aren’t allowed! Presenting a letter from 
a witness, rather than having the witness at the 
hearing, is hearsay evidence. 

You need to prepare to lay the foundation for 
your exhibits.   

At the hearing, in order to get an exhibit admitted 
as evidence, a witness familiar with the exhibit 
must answer some questions. This is called laying 
the foundation. 

Questions to lay the foundation include: 

•  Does the witness have first-hand knowledge 
of the exhibit or know the facts surrounding 
the exhibit? “I took the photo and it shows 
what the scene looked like on the day in 
question.”  

•  Can the witness show that the exhibit is 

what you say it is? “This is a screenshot of 
www.notarealwebsite.com that I took on 
January 1, 2020, at 2:20 p.m.” 

Preparing your exhibits for the hearing. 

IMPORTANT! If you have exhibits on your cell 
phone or other electronic device, you must print 
out your exhibits.   

You can’t hand the judicial officer your cell phone 
or other electronic device to look at evidence! The 
judicial officer won’t accept your cell phone or 
other electronic device.

•  To letter your exhibits, your first exhibit is 

A, your second is B and so on.

Plaintiff’s Exhibit A

Small Claims Case # 

   

3rd  Make copies of all pages of all of your exhibits. 

• 

If your hearing is at the courthouse, you 
must bring at least 3 printed copies of any 
exhibit you want to introduce as evidence. 

o  1 for you; 
o  1 for the judicial officer; 
o  1 for the opposing party; 
o 

If you have a witness, bring a copy 
for the witness, too. 

Using your outline and exhibits, practice telling 
your side and presenting your evidence. 

Remember, you won’t have a lot of time to present 
your side at the hearing and you’ll need to be 
quick, to the point, and calm. 

If you can, try to watch a small claims court 
hearing.  They’re generally open to the public. 

Examples of exhibits are: 

•  Contracts or other documents; 
•  Receipts or cancelled checks;  
• 
Invoices or statements; 
•  Photos; 
•  Texts or emails; 
•  Audio or videos (check with the clerk ahead 
of time to see if you need to bring your own 
equipment). 

1st  Organize your exhibits into categories. For 
example, all photographs, all receipts, all printed 
text messages. 

2nd  Type or write an exhibit identifier on the first 
page of each exhibit. 

• 

If you have more than one exhibit in a 
category, you may type or write your 
exhibit identifier on the first page of the 
first exhibit in the category. 

An exhibit identifier includes: 1) the party (Plaintiff 
or Defendant); 2) an exhibit letter; and 3) the small 
claims case number. 

Your Small Claims Court Hearing 

Get to the hearing at least 30 minutes early! 

Make sure your witnesses are present and ready to testify. 

Make sure you have your outline and all copies of your exhibits. 

Before the hearing officially begins: 

Take a few moments to organize your outline and exhibits so you can easily and quickly locate what you need. 

Once the hearing begins, you don’t have much time to tell your side. 

You might have only 10-15 minutes to present your witnesses and exhibits.  Be quick, to the point, and stay 
calm. 

After the hearing, the judicial officer decides the case. 

 

 

If the judicial officer decides the case at the end of the hearing, you may be given a copy of the judgment at 
that time.  If the judicial officer decides later, or if a copy of the judgment isn’t provided at the end of the 
hearing, you’ll get the judgment in the mail. 

North Dakota Small Claims Court judgments are final.  There is NO appeal.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
