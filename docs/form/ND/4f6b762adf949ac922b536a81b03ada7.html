Beanstack For Your Summer 
Reading Program

lately, 

If  you’ve  been  part  of  the  bi-weekly  Library 
Community  Virtual  Meetings 
you’ve  
probably  heard  State  Library  staff  talk  about 
Beanstack.  For  those  of  you  who  may  not  be  
it 
aware  of  Beanstack, 
is  an  online  platform 
for 
in  their  summer  reading 
libraries  to  use 
programs.  Kids,  teens,  and  adults  will  be  able  to 
use  it  to  register  online  for  your  summer  reading 
program  and  keep  track  of  how  many  books 
or  minutes  they’ve  read  through  the  platform, 
along  with  any  challenges  they  have  completed. 

he  North  Dakota  State  Library 
is  making  
Beanstack  available  for  all  public  libraries  in  the  
state who would like to participate. The challenges 
can  be  sent  out  this  week,  so  you  have  time  to 
prepare before summer starts.

  T

If  your  library  is  interested  in  participating  or  if  
you  have  any  questions,  please  contact  Shari  
Mosser at ssandwick@nd.gov or 701-328-4622.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

in-person  opportunities 

While  it  has  been  nice  to  connect  with  
people  virtually,  it  doesn’t  substitute  for  
to  make 
those 
connections  and  network. 
I  am  grateful  
for  the  technology  that  does  allow  us  to 
continue  to  connect  to  people  through  this 
difficult time.

  have  received  several  cards,  emails,  texts, 
and  direct  messages  from  a  variety  of  
people  since  the  pandemic  began.  I  have 
treasured  each  one  and  appreciate  the  
time  the  person  took  to  make  a  special 
connection with me. I have tried to connect 
with  others  in  these  same  ways.  I  am  more 
grateful  than  ever  for  social  networking  to 
connect with people as well.

  believe  the  current  situation  that  we  are  
in  has  made  us  treasure  the  connections 
with  people  around  us  more  than  ever,  
and  I  sincerely  hope  we  never  take  that 
for  granted  in  the  future.  It  is  so  easy  to 
get  caught  up  in  the  busyness  and  forget  
about  the  people.  I  hope  that  one  lasting 
is 
the  pandemic 
positive  of 
that  we 
that  we’ve  
things 
appreciate 
missed, 
learn  to  slow  down,  and  truly  
treasure  the  opportunities  to  connect  with 
others.  Please  feel  free  to  reach  out  to  me 
via  email,  phone,  text,  social  media,  or  an 
old  fashioned  card  or  letter.  I  look  forward 
to  connecting  with  you  either  virtually  
or 
the  hopefully  not-so- 
in-person 
distant future.

issues  of 

Normally  during  the  month  of  May, 
I  
would  be  traveling  to  Washington,  D.C., 
in  the  American  Library 
to  participate 
Association’s  National  Library  Legislative  
Day  (NLLD).  I  would  spend  a  day  learning 
importance  to  the 
about  the 
national  library  community  as  well  as  how  
to  work  with  the 
local/statewide  press 
and  how  to  help  libraries  learn  to  share 
their  story  in  a  more  compelling  manner.  I  
would  then  meet  with  the  staff  for  our  
three  federal  legislators,  and  perhaps  I’d  
even  have  an  opportunity  to  meet  directly  
with  one  of  the  North  Dakota  Legislators. 
I  would  usually  take  some  time  to  visit  the 
Library  of  Congress  as  well.  I  would  then  
spend  the  third  day  attending  the  Chief  
Officers  of  State  Library  Agencies  (COSLA) 
is  the  State  Librarian’s 
meeting;  COSLA 
Association. 
is  always  a  wonderful 
opportunity filled with learning, networking, 
and connecting with other State Librarians.

It 

ike  many  other  things  impacted  by  the 
current  pandemic,  NLLD  and  our  COSLA 
spring  meeting  changed  from 
in-person 
events  to  virtual  ones.  Along  with  our  
weekly  Library  Community  meetings, 
I 
attend  weekly  COSLA  meetings  and/or  
town halls with the Association of Rural and 
Small  Libraries  when  I  can  work  it  into  my 
schedule.  The  State  Library  staff  has  also 
been  meeting  (almost)  weekly  via  Zoom. 
Governor  Burgum  has  also  hosted  several 
Team  ND  Town  Halls  for  state  employees.

Programming Spotlight: Geocache Location

Since  library  programming  is  bound  to  look  different  this  year,  many  libraries  are  shifting  
towards  more  passive  programs  that  can  be  held  outside  of  the  library.  Geocaching  is  a 
popular  pastime  where  participants  use  GPS  and  latitude/longitude  coordinates  to  find  hidden  
treasures.  When  participants  want  to  find  a  cache,  they  go  to  geocaching.com  and  search  for 
coordinates  near  them.  The  locations  can  be  rated  for  difficulty  and  sometimes  include  hints  
to  find  the  cache.  Some  caches  are  a  series  where  the  first  location  will  give  you  a  clue  to  
another nearby cache until you get to the final one.

Since  traditional  caches  are  not  indoors,  creating  a  geocache  or  series  of  geocaches  near  
your  library  is  a  perfect  social  distancing  program.  Inside  your  cache,  you  can  include  a  
small  notebook  for  people  to  sign  as  well  as  any  small  prizes  you  might  want  to  pass  along. 
Geocachers  around  the  world  like  to  pick  up  the  tokens  at  one  cache  and  spread  them  to  
their next cache, so this is a great way to spread the love of your library around your community.

Course of the Month: Dog Grooming 101

Grooming  your  pet  is  one  of  the  many  struggles  that  
dog  owners  may  face.  Universal  Class  offers  a  Dog 
Grooming  101  course  that  takes  the  student  through  
the  basics  of  grooming  their  dog  and  what  tools  they  
will need to do it properly. 

Not  only  will  this  course  go  through  dog  grooming  step-by-step,  but  it  will  also  go  over  why  it  is 
important to your dog’s health. After you have completed this course, you will feel confident in your 
skills to groom your dog properly.

This  course  is  11  lessons  long,  has  24  exams  and  assignments,  and  should  take  around  12  hours  
to complete.

If you have any questions, please e-mail us at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

New NDSL Resources on the Opioid Crisis

   

 

MAY 2020

is  primarily 

(and 
While  the  country’s  attention 
understandably) focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, 
other  issues  can  become  temporarily  overlooked  – 
like  the  opioid  crisis.  The  opioid  crisis,  also  known  
as  the  opioid  epidemic,  refers  to  the  misuse,  
addiction,  and  overdose  of  prescription  opioids 
(like Vicodin  and  OxyContin)  and  illegal  opioids  (like  
heroin and fentanyl analogs).

The  opioid  crisis  has  become  a  frightening  problem  
in the country, and the statistics are staggering. Here  
is a brief synopsis of the not-so-fun facts: 

•  128  Americans  die  each  day  from  an  opioid 

overdose. 

•  Americans  are  now  more  likely  to  die  from  an 

opioid overdose than a car crash. 

•  Over  10  million  people  misused  prescription 

opioids in 2018.

•  Overdose  deaths 

linked  to  synthetic  opioids  

were over 10x higher in 2018 than in 2013.

•  In 2018, the opioid crisis cost the U.S. an estimated 

$179.4 billion. 

More 
recently,  opioid  overdose  deaths  have  
declined  slightly  in  the  country  (perhaps  a  sign  that 
awareness  and  prevention  programs  are  working). 
However,  there  are  growing  concerns  that  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  may  make  the  opioid  epidemic 
even worse. 

Opioid  misuse,  addiction,  and  overdose  can  
happen  anywhere  and  to  anyone.  It  also  happens  
here  in  North  Dakota.  We  are  not  exempt.  You  may 
have  even  heard  Governor  Burgum  mention  the 

opioid  crisis  during  his  COVID-19  press  conferences 
(Behavioral  Health  and  Addiction  is  one  of  his  Five 
Strategic Initiatives). 

To  facilitate  the  need  for  information,  training,  and 
resources  on  the  opioid  crisis,  NDSL  has  created  a 
tutorial, course, and guide. 

•  The  tutorial  (available  on  YouTube)  provides  a 
brief overview of the opioid crisis and explains the 
various resources available from NDSL. 

•  The course (available on Niche Academy provides 

an in-depth look at the opioid crisis.

•  The  guide 

(available  on  LibGuides) 

is  a  
condensed  version  of  the  Niche  course  and 
provides  core 
information  about  the  opioid  
crisis.  The  guide  includes  additional  resources 
(like  handouts,  books,  flyers,  and  articles)  that  
are  not  included  in  the  course.  The  guide  also  
includes 
an  Opioid  Overdose  Prevention  
Program template for public libraries. 

is  no  time 

There 
like  the  present  to  make  a  
difference  and  help  fight  the  opioid  crisis.  Anyone 
can  help,  including  libraries.  In  fact,  many  libraries 
across  the  country  have  been  on  the  front  lines  of 
the  opioid  crisis.  And  many  are  choosing  to  help  by 
doing  things  like  raising  awareness,  learning  the  
signs  of  an  overdose,  and  retaining  Narcan  in  case  
of an emergency. 

Libraries  “are  experiencing 
the  nation’s  opioid 
crisis  firsthand  and  are  choosing  to  respond  to  it  
in  collaboration  with  their  community  and  partners. 
When  partners  and 
libraries  come  together  to  
better  serve  their  community,  they  make  a  real  
impact" (source).

including  The  Girl  With  All  the  Gifts,  and  now  he

Stars,  a  nearly-900-page  doorstopper  featuring  
a  xenobiologist,  an  ancient  alien  civilization,  
and  a  discovery  that  will  completely  change  
the future of humanity.

ext  month,  let’s  try  to  learn  something  new  
in  a  fun  way  with  a  look  at  some  of  2020’s  best  
and most highly-anticipated nonfiction titles.

Fantasy  and  science  fiction  are  usually  grouped 
together,  two  genres  that  explore  the  idea  of  
other  worlds  and  other  possibilities,  usually  at 
some  length.  Last  month,  we  looked  at  new  
fantasy  titles,  so  this  month,  let’s  take  a  look  at 
fantasy’s  twin  and  see  what  2020  has  in  store  
for science fiction.

hris  Kluwe might be a familiar name to  football 
fans,  but  luckily  for  readers,  he’s  turned  his 
attention  to  writing  in  recent  years.  Otaku  is  his 
debut  novel,  and  it  introduces  us  to  Ditchtown,  
a  city  of  massive  buildings  erected  above  a  
flooded  Miami,  where  a  young  woman  tries 
to  balance  the  complicated  real  world  with 
her  massive  success  in  the  virtual  world  of  the  
Infinite Game.

ormally,  I  try  to  write  my  own  summaries  for 
this  article,  but  the  perfect  description  for  Myke 
Cole’s  Sixteenth  Watch  already  exists.  Goodreads 
describes  the  plot  as  “the  Coast  Guard  must 
prevent  the  first  lunar  war  in  history,”  and  if  
that  doesn’t  whet  your  appetite,  I’m  not  sure  
that I could come up with anything that would.

ther  than  having  an  amazing  title,  Eeleen  Lee’s 
is  the  
debut  novel  Liquid  Crystal  Nightingale 
type  of  genre-bending  story  that  really  stays  
with  you.  Pleo  has  spent  her  life  struggling  to 
get  away  from  her  home,  but  being  accused 
of  murdering  her  rich  rival  wasn’t  in  her  five-
year-plan.  The  accusation  sends  Pleo  on  a 
surreal  journey  through  her  fragmented  colony, 
where  the  wealthy  stay  wealthy  with  a  lot  of  
infighting,  and  everybody  else  is  just  along  for  
the ride.

ans  of  madcap  space  adventures  should  look  
no  further  than  Zack  Jordan’s  The  Last  Human,  
the  story  of  the  galaxy’s  only  human  being  and  
all the forces in the universe that want her dead. 
Sarya  leads  as  normal  a  life  as  she  can,  even

Legal Research Resources for Informal Probate of an Estate 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

MAY 2020

   

 

 

Asking  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  
appoint  a  personal  representative  for  a  deceased 
person’s  estate  is  a  frequently  requested  legal 
research  topic  by  self-represented  patrons  of  the 
North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library  and  
North Dakota Legal Self Help Center.

Personal  Representative  –  a  person  appointed 
by  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  settle 
and  distribute  the  estate  of  a  deceased  person.  
North  Dakota  law  includes  a  list  of  persons  who  
may be appointed personal representative in order 
of priority. 

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources  
in  North  Dakota  for  informal  probate  of  an  estate  
in North Dakota state district court.

DEFINITIONS IN AN INFORMAL PROBATE CASE

Estate  –  All  of  the  property  a  deceased  person 
owned  or  had  an  interest  in  on  the  date  of  
their death.

Property  –  All  real  and  personal  property  of  the 
deceased  person.  Real  property  is  land  and  things 
attached  to  the  land,  such  as  buildings.  Personal 
property  is  everything  that  isn’t  real  property,  
such as money, stocks, vehicles, and furniture.

person’s 

in  a  
Non-Probate  Property  –  The  property 
deceased 
transfers  
automatically  upon  their  death.  For  example,  a 
life  insurance  policy  that  transfers  to  a  named  
individual after providing a death certificate.

estate 

that 

Probate  Property  –  The  property  in  a  deceased 
person’s  estate  that  doesn’t  automatically  transfer 
upon  their  death.  The  transfer  of  property 
is 
determined  by  the  deceased  person’s  will,  or  by 
intestate succession.

Will  –  A 
legal  document  detailing  a  person’s  
wishes  for  transferring  ownership  of  the  property  
of their estate after death.

Intestate  Succession  –  When  a  person  dies  
without  a  will,  North  Dakota’s  intestate  succession 
laws  determine  to  who  receives  the  deceased 
person’s  property.  These  laws  also  apply  if  the 
deceased  person’s  will  doesn’t 
include  all  of  
the property.

Heir – the person entitled to the deceased person’s 
property  according  to  the  deceased  person’s  will, 
or,  if  there  is  no  will,  by  North  Dakota’s  intestate 
succession laws.

WHAT IS AN INFORMAL PROBATE CASE?

When  a  person  dies,  most  of  the  work  to  be  
done  with  the  estate  is  the  legal  and  orderly  
transfer  of  the  deceased  person’s  property  to  the 
persons  entitled  to  receive  it  (the  creditors  and  
heirs).  When  a  deceased  person  has  probate 
property that needs to be transferred, the property 
is transferred as part of a probate case.

representative 

is  appointed  by  
A  personal 
the  North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  settle  
and transfer the probate property of the deceased 
person.

There  are  two  types  of  probate  cases  to  appoint  a 
personal  representative  –  informal  probate  and 
formal probate.

Informal  probate  cases  are  designed  to  allow  for 
limited  supervision  of  the  personal  representative 
by the North Dakota state district court. The person 
requesting to be appointed personal representative 
must show they meet the requirements for informal 
probate. If they meet the requirements, the district 
court  may  appoint  the  personal  representative 
without holding an in-person hearing.

The requirements for informal probate are:

•  Less  than  three  years  have  passed  since  the  

date of death;
•  The  person 

requesting  appointment  as  
personal  representative  is  at  the  top  of  the 
priority  list,  or  has  a  signed  waiver  from  every 
person  equal  to  or  above  them  on  the  priority 
list; and

•  The  application  for  appointment  and  other 
documents,  including  the  will  (if  any),  and 
waivers (if any), are filed with the district court.

MAY 2020

Formal  probate  cases  are  designed  for  increased 
supervision  of  the  personal  representative  by 
the  North  Dakota  state  district  court.  In-person  
hearings  are  a  required  part  of  the 
formal  
probate process.

Formal  probate  is  required  when  the  validity  of  a 
will  needs  to  be  determined,  there  are  objections  
to  using  the  informal  probate  process,  or  when  
more  than  3  years  have  passed  since  the  date  
of death. 

If  a  request  for  formal  probate  is  received  after  a 
personal  representative  has  been  appointed  as  
part  of  an  informal  probate  case,  the  district  court 
may  decide  the  case  must  continue  as  a  formal 
probate case. 

WHERE IS AN INFORMAL PROBATE CASE FILED?

If  the  deceased  person  is  a  resident  of  North  
Dakota,  the  case  is  filed  in  the  state  district  court 
of  the  North  Dakota  county  where  the  deceased 
person lived.

If  the  deceased  person  isn’t  a  resident  of  North 
Dakota,  the  case  is  filed  in  the  state  district  court 
of  the  North  Dakota  county  where  the  deceased 
person’s property is located.

If  the  deceased  person  isn’t  a  resident  of  North 
Dakota  and  doesn’t  own,  or  have  an  interest,  in 
property  located  in  North  Dakota,  an  informal 
probate case can’t be filed in a North Dakota state 
district court.
