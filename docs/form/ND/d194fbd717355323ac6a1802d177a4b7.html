      <pre>Instructions for Accepting Appointment of Guardian for a Minor 
as Part of a Probate Case 

Important! Read Before Using These Forms and Instructions 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. Carefully 
read this information and any instructions to which you’re referred. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. If you’re unsure if these forms and instructions 
suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

For information about how to find a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-
lawyer. 

As a self-represented individual, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to North Dakota state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
process for accepting appointment as guardian of a minor as part of a probate case in a North 
Dakota state district court.  There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms 
available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the forms or information provided.  Use at your own risk. 

 

WARNING – Acceptance of appointment of guardian can have serious legal and 
financial consequences for both the minor and the guardian. It’s strongly 
recommended that you consult a lawyer and carefully consider all of your options 
before you accept the appointment as guardian of a minor (under 18 years of age) in a 
North Dakota State District Court Probate case. 

ndcourts.gov “Legal Self Help & Forms”

Accept 30.1-27 Guardian/Rev Oct 2022 

A guardian's authority and responsibility terminates on the death, resignation, or removal 
of the guardian, or on the minor child's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of 
majority (age 18). Termination doesn’t affect the guardian's liability for prior acts or the 
guardian's obligation to account for funds and assets of the minor child. 

   

You May Use this Packet of Forms If: 

1.  The minor child’s parent is deceased and: 

a.  There is no other living parent, or  
b.  Any other living parent’s parental rights have been terminated by court order; 

2.  The deceased parent left a will, which is being probated in a North Dakota state district 

3.  The deceased parent’s will named you the guardian (or guardians) of the minor child;  

4.  You want to accept the parent’s nomination as guardian of the minor child. 

***The guardian named in the will must file a criminal history record check with the District 
Court.  A criminal history doesn’t automatically disqualify the guardian. 

If You Don’t Meet the Requirements to Use this Packet of Forms, 
You May Petition Juvenile Court: 

If your situation doesn’t meet the requirements to use this packet of forms, you may petition a 
North Dakota Juvenile Court to appoint you the guardian (or guardians) of the minor child. 

For more information about the North Dakota Juvenile Court process, review the Juvenile Court 
Guardianship instructions and forms available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/minor-
guardianship. 

For information about finding a lawyer to help you decide if guardianship is right for you and 
the minor child, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer.

Overview of the Eight Step Process to Appoint a Guardian for a Minor 
in a Probate Case 

Step One. 

Step Two. 

Step Three. 

Step Four. 

Step Five. 

The Nominated Guardian Files Acceptance of Appointment with the District 
Court Probating the Deceased Parent’s Will 
If the nominated guardian doesn’t accept appointment, the guardianship case 
transfers to North Dakota Juvenile Court for further proceedings. 

After Acceptance of Appointment is Filed, the District Court Appoints a 
Guardian ad Litem (GAL) 
Within 60 days of appointment, the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) files their written 
report with recommendations about the nominated guardian and guardianship. 

The Nominated Guardian Serves Notice of Their Appointment by Will on the 
Minor Child and Others 
Notice of the Guardian’s appointment and right to object to the Guardian must 
be served on the minor child, the person caring for the child, and the child’s 
nearest adult relative. A copy of the acceptance must be served with the notice. 

The Nominated Guardian Files an Affidavit and Criminal History Record Check 
with the District Court 
Within 45 days of filing their acceptance, the individual nominated as guardian 
must file an affidavit and criminal history record check with the District Court. 

Written Objections to the Appointment of the Guardian Must be Filed within 
14 days of the GAL Filing their Report with the District Court 
Within 14 days of filing the GAL report with the District Court, any person 
interested in the welfare of the minor child, including the child, may file a 
written objection with the District Court. If written objections are filed, the 
guardianship case transfers to North Dakota Juvenile Court. 

Step Six. 

If No Objections are Filed, the District Court may Approve Acceptance of 
Appointment Without an In-Court Hearing 
The District Court may require an in-court hearing first. 

Step Seven. 

The District Court Issues Letters of Guardianship 
After the District Court approves acceptance of appointment of the guardian, 
the District Court issues letters of guardianship to the guardian. 

Step Eight. 

The Guardianship is Transferred to Juvenile Court for all Further Proceedings 
After the District Court issues letters of guardianship to the guardian, the 
guardianship portion of the probate case transfers to North Dakota Juvenile 
Court for all further proceedings.

of guardian without holding an in-court hearing.

inventory report with Juvenile Court listing all assets owned by the minor child or in which the 
child has an interest.
