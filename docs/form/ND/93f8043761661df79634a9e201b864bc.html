      <pre>Instructions for the Conservator’s Annual Report & Financial Accounting 

Court employees may not help you fill out this form. 
Do not include these instructions when you file the completed form. 

Purpose of Conservator’s Annual Report and Financial Accounting 

North Dakota’s conservatorship laws require every conservator appointed by a North Dakota 
state district court to file an annual report. The annual report is the conservator’s description of 
how they exercised the powers and duties specified in the Court’s appointment order. 

The Conservator’s Annual Report and Financial Accounting must describe for the Court all 
expenditures and income affecting the protected individual’s estate, any sale or transfer of 
property affecting the protected individual’s estate, and any exercise of authority by the 
conservator affecting the protected individual’s estate. 

The Annual Report is a picture of the protected individual’s financial wellbeing. It should 
provide details on how the estate was managed during the year. Attach additional pages as 
needed.  

Review the Court’s order appointing you conservator. The order will tell you when your Annual 
Report is due. Fillable forms are available at ndcourts.gov by clicking on the “Legal Self Help & 
Forms” link. If you have not yet submitted a Beginning Inventory report to the court, please 
include that form with this annual accounting. 

Note: if you have any other decision-making authority (in addition to financial authority) for the 
protected individual, you should complete the Annual Report of Guardianship instead of this 
report. The Guardianship report requests additional information that must be submitted to the 
court.  

Confidentiality of the Protected Individual 

Don’t include personal identification numbers such as birthdates, social security numbers, or 
financial account numbers in this beginning inventory report. Rule 3.4 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court requires that reports can’t contain the following identification information:  

•  Social security numbers (use the last 4 digits only) 
•  Taxpayer identification numbers 
•  Full birthdates (use the year of birth only) 
•  Financial account numbers (use the last 4 digits only) 

If financial documents are attached, please completely cross out the full account numbers so 
the account numbers are unreadable.

Conservator’s Annual Report & Financial Accounting 

Top of Conservator’s Annual Report & Financial Accounting Form 

• 

If the Court hasn’t completed the top of the forms for you, use the Letters of 
Conservatorship to complete the following: 

o  Enter the county and district court names.  
o  Fill in legal name of the protected individual.  
o  Enter the case number from the Letters of Conservatorship. 

Protected Individual and Conservator Information  

•  Fill in the current address, age and phone number of the protected individual. 
•  Fill in the information for the conservator. Add co-conservators or guardians in 

Paragraph 2 on the Page 2. Include addresses, phone numbers, and emails for each.  

Notice to the Protected Individual 

This report should be presented and explained to the protected individual. The protected 
individual or anyone interested in the protected individual’s welfare, may petition the court to 
make changes in the conservatorship.  

Notice to the Conservators 

Financial authority may be shared with others; work with co-guardians and co-conservators to 
complete this report. If the protected individual has federally appointed representatives 
managing their Social Security, Veteran’s or other benefits, please attach reports provided by 
those fiduciary representatives. Also, be sure that co-conservators or co-guardians receive a 
copy of your accounting. 

Paragraph 1 

•  Read carefully. 

Paragraphs 2-7: Conservator’s Annual Report 

This section of the report gives the Court personal and legal information about the protected 
individual, such as whether or not the individual has dependents. 

Use Paragraph 7 to summarize how you exercised your decision-making authority, and note any 
financial problems or potential problems. Describe out-of-the ordinary circumstances such as 
pending lawsuits or changes in insurance policies. If you need more space, you may attach 
additional pages written on one side only.

Paragraphs 8-14: Financial Accounting of the Estate 

Enter the report period. For the first annual report, the beginning date will be the date of 
appointment of conservatorship. The end date will be the end of the month 12 months later 
(unless otherwise directed by the court), and will be due 30 days after that month-end. The 
following year’s report will have a beginning period date of the first of the month following the 
month-end of last year’s report.  

Annual report period example: if the Letters of Conservatorship are dated April 16, 2020, that 
is the beginning date of the first annual report. The end date will be March 31, 2021. The report 
will be due on April 30, 2021. The beginning date of the second annual report will be April 1, 
2021 and the end date will be March 31, 2022. Note that the court may order different annual 
reporting dates.  

The reporting period can be adjusted to meet the unique needs of the estate and conservators; 
however, if the protected individual also has a guardian, the reporting period for the Financial 
Accounting needs to coincide with the reporting period of the guardian’s Annual Wellbeing 
Report. 

Paragraph 8 

• 

• 

Paragraph 9 

Paragraph 10 

 

•  Beginning balance: These are the accounts that you or other authorized people use to 

pay expenses for the protected individual’s care. 

If this is the first annual report, the beginning balance is the total of the “Cash, checking 
accounts” section of the Beginning Inventory report. If this isn’t the first annual report, 
the beginning account balance will be the ending balance from the prior year’s Financial 
Accounting.  

Income and deposits include all income as well as transfers into the checking account(s) 
from other accounts such as savings or trusts. Total all of the income and deposits on 
the line at the bottom of this section. 

•  Expenses and withdrawals include all of the payments made this year on behalf of the 
protected individual, and any transfers out to other accounts. Any large or unusual 
expenses should be described in Paragraph 15. The “Personal needs” category includes 
clothing, hygiene and beauty products, first aid, and similar products and services. Total 
all of the expenditures on the line at the bottom of this section.

Paragraph 11 

Paragraph 12 

Paragraph 13 

Paragraph 14 

Paragraph 15 

Paragraph 16 

 

•  The ending balance is the sum of the beginning balance plus the total of all deposits, 
and the subtraction of all the expenditures. The ending balance amount will be the 
beginning balance for next year’s report. This balance should match the protected 
individual’s total checking and spending account balances on the end date of this 
financial accounting report period. 

•  The current asset listing is similar to an inventory report. All of the protected individual’s 

assets and current values should be listed here. New assets acquired should be 
explained in Paragraph 15. 

•  List all assets that have been sold or disposed of since the last report to the Court. 

Include the purpose for the disposal, the person or company that received the asset, 
and where the income was deposited. This information is helpful for the Court to 
monitor reductions in the estate. Disposals should be described in Paragraph 15. 

•  All of the protected individual’s debt should be listed. Any significant new debt acquired 

should be explained in Paragraph 15. 

•  Use this space to explain large or unusual expenditures and asset disposals. You may 
also discuss debt arrangements, loss of income or assets, plans for future asset 
management, or other information of interest to the Court. Describe out-of-the ordinary 
events such as accidental property damage or insurance settlements. If you need more 
space, you may attach additional pages written on one side only. 

•  List the names and current addresses of all interested persons the Court included in the 

order appointing you conservator. If you don’t know the current address, make 
reasonable efforts to find the current address. 

•  You’re required to mail a copy of your completed, dated, and signed Conservator’s 

Annual Report & Financial Accounting to every interested person.
