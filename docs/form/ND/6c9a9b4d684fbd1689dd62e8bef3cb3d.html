NO ASSISTANCE WITH COURT PROCESS IN CRIMINAL CASES 

The ND Legal Self Help Center can provide information about the court process in civil cases in 
North Dakota state courts to people who represent themselves.   

The ND Legal Self Help Center can’t provide assistance with court process in criminal cases and 
doesn’t have forms, procedures, or expertise available in this area. 

If you represent yourself, you’ll need to conduct your own legal research, determine the 
appropriate procedures, and create your own legal documents.  You may also retain an 
attorney to assist you with all or part of your legal representation. 

Following are legal research resources to get you started in your research into the requirements 
of expunging North Dakota criminal records. 

Caution!  When you represent yourself, you’re held to same requirements and responsibilities 
as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.

OVERVIEW OF EXPUNGMENT OF CRIMINAL RECORDS 

To determine if you can ask a North Dakota district court to expunge your North Dakota 
criminal records, you’ll need to research the laws related to the crime(s) and the laws related 
to expungement.  You may wish to consult an attorney. 

In general, expungement of criminal records is deletion and destruction of all record 
information.  In North Dakota, expungement of criminal records is only available in limited 
circumstances. 

Currently, expungement of criminal records is limited to the following: 

1.  Records as a direct result of being a victim of human trafficking:  If convictions of 
prostitution, misdemeanor forgery, misdemeanor theft, insufficient funds or credit 
offenses, manufacture or possession of a controlled or counterfeit substances offenses, 
or drug paraphernalia offenses were committed as a direct result of being a victim of 
human trafficking, the defendant may make a motion to the court to vacate and 
expunge the record of conviction.  (NDCC Section 12.1-41-14) 

2.  Records for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana:  If the conviction is a first 

time offense and the defendant doesn’t have another conviction within two years, the 
defendant may make a motion to the court to expunge the records.  (NDCC Section 19-
03.1-23) 

3.  Records of juvenile court unruly/delinquency proceedings:  Delinquency records are 

retained for 10 years after the final order, or age 18, whichever is later.  Unruly records 
are retained for 1 year after age 18 or the expiration of the final order, whichever is 
later.  The records are destroyed and all agencies involved are notified.  Upon inquiry 
about the records, the agencies reply that no records exist.  (NDCC Section 27-20.2-25; 
Rule 19 of the North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure) 

4.  Records of DNA profiles:  A defendant may petition the court to order the State Crime 
Laboratory to expunge the DNA profile from the database if the arrest that led to the 
addition of the defendant’s DNA profile in the database 1) didn’t result in a felony 
charge within one year; 2) was resolved by a dismissal, acquittal, or misdemeanor 
conviction; 3) didn’t result in a felony conviction; or 4) the conviction on which the 
authority for including the DNA profile was based has been reversed or the case 
dismissed.  (NDCC Section 31-13-07) 

5.  Records of unconstitutional arrests:  If the arrest was unconstitutional and the charges 
were dismissed or the conviction overturned, the defendant may petition the court to 
expunge the arrest records.  (State v. Howe, 308 N.W.2d 743 (N.D. 1981))

In North Dakota, criminal record information is mainly found in the court records maintained 
by the North Dakota court system, and in the criminal history records maintained by the 
Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). 

The North Dakota court system maintains records of documents and evidence that were filed 
with the court during the criminal case.  The North Dakota court system also maintains records 
generated during hearings or trials that occurred during the criminal case.  Members of the 
public can search court records online at ndcourts.gov/public-access. 

The Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) is North Dakota’s central repository for criminal 
history information.  BCI compiles records of arrests and prosecutions of individual offenders 
for use by law enforcement, the courts, and the public. The criminal history information is 
submitted by local law enforcement agencies, state's attorneys, the courts, parole & probation, 
etc., to BCI.  Information about BCI is found online at attorneygeneral.nd.gov. 

You may wish to research pardons in North Dakota. 

Pardon means the removal of punishment or custody imposed upon a person for the 
commission of an offense. A pardon doesn’t remove the fact of that person's conviction or plea 
or finding of guilt for an offense unless specifically stated in the certificate of pardon.  

Pardons are a function of the executive branch of North Dakota government. 

The Pardon Advisory Board makes recommendations to the Governor.  Recommendations 
aren’t official until signed by the Governor.  Information about the Pardon Advisory Board 
process is available at governor.nd.gov/boards. 

The North Dakota Pardon Advisory Board Application is available at docr.nd.gov/parole-pardon-
boards. 

You may wish to research summary pardons for marijuana offenses in North Dakota. 

Persons prosecuted for and convicted of possession of marijuana, ingestion of marijuana, and 
possession of marijuana paraphernalia who haven’t had any convictions in the past 5 years may 
submit a Summary Pardon Application. 

The Pardon Advisory Board makes recommendations to the Governor.  Recommendations 
aren’t official until signed by the Governor.  Information about the Pardon Advisory Board 
process is available at www.governor.nd.gov/boards. 

The North Dakota Pardon Advisory Board Application to Pardon Eligible Marijuana Offenses is 
available at www.docr.nd.gov/parole-pardon-boards.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW RELATED TO EXPUNGEMENT OF CRIMINAL 
RECORDS: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

Records of unconstitutional arrests: 

The North Dakota Supreme Court decision, State v. Howe, 308 N.W.2d 743 (N.D. 1981), 
provides for expungement of records of unconstitutional arrests. 

•  State v. Howe isn’t available at ndcourts.gov. 
•  State v. Howe is published in print in the North Western Reporter 2nd Series in Volume 

308 at page 743. 

•  The opinion may be available free of charge at Google Scholar (scholar.google.com), 

Justia (law.justia.com), and the Legal Information Institute (law.cornell.edu). 

•  The opinion may be available for a monthly subscription rate at VersusLaw 

(versuslaw.com) and Fastcase (fastcase.com). 

Review the North Dakota Supreme Court opinions related to the crime(s) and laws related to 
expungement.  One way to research case law related to the crime(s) and expungement of 
criminal records, is to use the print version of the North Dakota Century Code to find the short 
summaries of case law after each Section of the Century Code.  The case law summaries are 
located directly following the text of the Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the 
opinion, go to ndcourts.gov and click on “Supreme Court Opinions.”  Enter the case name or 
case citation. 

Another way to research case law related to the crime(s) and expungement of criminal records, 
is to search by topic at ndcourts.gov and click on “Supreme Court Opinions.”  Use the “Topic” 
drop down list to narrow your search by topic.

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE THROUGH LEGISLATION, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES 
AND RULINGS, AND COURT DECISIONS.   

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota 
law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the 
North Dakota Century Code and North Dakota court rules are found in many North Dakota 
public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

LIBRARY RESOURCES: (Not all legal resources are available online.) 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

BASIC COURT PROCESS INFORMATION 

PROCESS FOR PETITIONING FOR EXPUNGEMENT OF CRIMINAL RECORDS: 

If you determine that you meet the requirements to ask the court to expunge records of an 
unconstitutional arrest or to order the State Crime Laboratory to expunge the DNA profile from 
the database, you’ll need to petition the court for expungement. 

If you determine that the petition should be filed as a civil action, carefully review the 
“Starting a Civil Action” Section of the “Guide to District Court Civil Action”. This can be found 
at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help  in the “District Court Civil” Section.   

The “Starting a Civil Action” Section provides the basic process for starting a civil action with a 
summons and complaint (or petition). 

PROCESS FOR A MOTION IN AN EXISTING CRIMINAL CASE: 

If you determine that you meet the requirements to ask the court to expunge records of a first-
time conviction of possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, or to vacate and expunge 
conviction records of offenses committed as a direct result of being a victim of human 
trafficking, you’ll need to make a written motion to the court for expungement. 

The motion is made in your existing criminal case. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center can’t provide assistance in criminal matters and doesn’t have 
forms, instructions, or expertise available. 

Rule 47 of the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure contains rules related to making a 
motion, or request, to a court in a criminal matter. (ndcourts.gov/legal-
resources/rules/ndrcrimp) 

•  Examples of some types of motion documents are available in the Appendix of Forms of 

the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure. 

Rule 49 of the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure contains rules related to the 
requirements of serving the motion to all other parties in the criminal matter. 

•  Rule 49 states that service must be made by following Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules 
of Civil Procedure.  Information and instructions for service as required by Rule 5 of the 
North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/service-in-a-civil-action.

FORMS RELATED TO RECORDS MAINTAINED BY THE COURT SYSTEM: 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions available specifically for 
expungement of criminal records. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center does have two sets of forms related to records maintained by the 
North Dakota state court system. 

Early Destruction of Juvenile Records: 

The ND Legal Self Help Center has forms and instructions for requesting that the juvenile court 
destroy the records early.  The forms and instructions are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help by scrolling to the “Juvenile Court” section. 

Motion to Prohibit Public Internet Access to Criminal Court Records: 

The ND Legal Self Help Center has forms and instructions for requesting the court prohibit 
public internet access to criminal court records at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by scrolling to 
the “Miscellaneous” section. 

***This isn’t a motion to expunge criminal records.***  If the court grants your request to limit 
public internet access to your criminal court records, this only applies to requests for court 
records.  This doesn’t limit public access to court records that have been reported to law 
enforcement agencies or the Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
