      <pre>CHAPTER 14-07.4
UNIFORM INTERSTATE ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTION ORDERS ACT

14-07.4-01. Definitions.
In this chapter:
1.

"Foreign protection order" means a protection order issued by a tribunal of another 
state.
"Issuing state" means the state whose tribunal issues a protection order.
"Mutual   foreign   protection   order"   means   a   foreign   protection   order   that   includes 
provisions issued in favor of both the protected individual seeking enforcement of the 
order and the respondent.
"Protected individual" means an individual protected by a protection order.
"Protection order" means an injunction or other order, issued by a tribunal under the 
domestic violence or family violence laws of the issuing state, to prevent an individual 
from   engaging   in   violent   or   threatening   acts   against,   harassment   of,   contact   or 
communication with, or physical proximity to another individual. The term includes an

"Respondent" means the individual against whom enforcement of a protection order is 
sought.
"State" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the

jurisdiction to issue protection orders.
"Tribunal" means a court, agency, or other entity authorized by law to issue or modify a 
protection order.

14-07.4-02. Judicial enforcement of order.
1.

A  tribunal   of   this   state   shall   enforce   the   terms   of   a   valid   foreign   protection   order, 
including   terms  that   provide   relief   that   a  tribunal   of   this   state   would   lack   power   to 
provide   but   for   this   section.  A  tribunal   of   this   state   shall   enforce   a   valid   foreign 
protection order issued by a tribunal, whether the order was obtained by independent 
action or in another proceeding, if it is an order issued in response to a complaint, 
petition, or motion filed by or on behalf of an individual seeking protection. A tribunal of 
this state may not enforce an order issued by a tribunal that does not recognize the 
standing of a protected individual to seek enforcement of the order.
A tribunal of this state shall enforce the provisions of a valid foreign protection order 
which   governs   custody   and   visitation.  The   custody   and   visitation   provisions   of   the 
order   must   have   been   issued   in   accordance   with   the   jurisdictional   requirements 
governing the issuance of custody and visitation orders in the issuing state.
A protection order is valid if it:
a.
b.
c. Was issued by a tribunal that had jurisdiction over the parties and matter under 

Identifies the protected individual and the respondent;
Is currently in effect;

the law of the issuing state; and

d. Was issued after the respondent was provided with reasonable notice and had an 
opportunity to be heard before the tribunal issued the order or, in the case of an 
order  ex parte,  the respondent  was  given notice  and  has  had  or  will  have  an 
opportunity to be heard within a reasonable time after the issuing of the order, in 
a manner consistent with the rights of the respondent to due process.

A  person   authorized   under   the   law   of   this   state   to   seek   enforcement   of   a   foreign 
protection order establishes a prima facie case for its validity by presenting an order 
valid on its face.
Absence of any of the criteria for validity of a foreign protection order is an affirmative 
defense in an action seeking enforcement of the order.
A tribunal of this state may enforce the provisions of a mutual foreign protection order 
which favor a respondent only if:

a.

b.

The   respondent   filed   a   written   pleading   seeking   a   protection   order   from   the 
tribunal of the issuing state; and
The tribunal of the issuing state made specific findings in favor of the respondent.

14-07.4-03. Nonjudicial enforcement of order.
1.

A law enforcement officer of this state, upon determining that there is probable cause 
to  believe   that   a   valid   foreign   protection   order   exists  and   that   the   order   has  been 
violated,   shall   enforce   the   order   as   if   it   were   the   order   of   a   tribunal   of   this   state. 
Presentation of a protection order that identifies both the protected individual and the 
respondent and, on its face, is currently in effect constitutes probable cause to believe 
that   a   valid   foreign   protection   order   exists.   For   the   purposes   of   this   section,   the 
protection order may be inscribed on a tangible medium or may have been stored in 
an electronic or other medium if it is retrievable in perceivable form. Presentation of a 
certified copy of a protection order is not required for enforcement.
If the protection order is not presented, the officer may consider other information in 
determining whether there is probable cause to believe that a valid foreign protection 
order exists.
If a law enforcement officer of this state determines that an otherwise valid foreign 
protection order cannot be enforced because the respondent has not been notified or 
served with the order, the officer shall inform the respondent of the order and make a 
reasonable   effort   to   serve   the   order   upon   the   respondent.   After   informing   the 
respondent and serving the order, the officer shall allow the respondent a reasonable 
opportunity to comply with the order before enforcing the order.

4. Registration or filing of an order in this state is not required for the enforcement of a 

valid foreign protection order under this chapter.

1.

Any individual may register a foreign protection order in this state. To register a foreign 
protection order, an individual shall present a certified copy of the order to any clerk of 
district court in this state.

3.

2. Upon receipt of a protection order, the clerk of district court shall register the order in 
accordance with this section. After the order is registered, the clerk of district court 
shall furnish to the individual registering the order a certified copy of the registered 
order. If a foreign order is registered, the clerk of district court shall transmit a copy of 
the order to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
The clerk  of   district  court  shall register  an  order  upon presentation  of  a  copy of  a 
protection  order  which has  been certified  by  the  issuing state.  A  registered  foreign 
protection order which is inaccurate or is not currently in effect shall be corrected or 
removed from the registry in accordance with the law of this state.
An   individual   registering   a   foreign   protection   order   shall   file   an   affidavit   by   the 
protected   individual   that,   to   the   best   of   the   individual's   knowledge,   the   order   is 
currently in effect.
A foreign protection order registered under this chapter may be entered in any existing 
state or federal registries of protection orders, in accordance with state or federal law.
A  fee   may  not   be   charged   for   the   registration   of   a  foreign   protection   order   or   the 
correction or removal of a foreign protection order.

attorney, clerk of district court, or any state or local governmental official acting in an official 
capacity,  is  immune from  civil  and criminal liability for  an act  or  omission  arising out  of  the 
registration or enforcement of a foreign protection order or the detention or arrest of an alleged 
violator of a foreign protection order if the act or omission is done in good faith in an effort to 
comply with this chapter.

Page No. 2

14-07.4-06. Other remedies.
Pursuing   remedies   under   this   chapter   does   not   preclude   a   protected   individual   from 

pursuing other legal or equitable remedies against the respondent.

14-07.4-07. Penalty.

subsequent violation of such an order is a class C felony.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
