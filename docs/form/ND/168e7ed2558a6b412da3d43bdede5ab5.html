NOTE:   (In 2021, the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “unruly” to “child in 
need of services.”) 

Who May Use this Packet? 

An individual who was the subject of a proceeding in North Dakota Juvenile Court AND: 

•  The proceeding in Juvenile Court was for a delinquent child or for a child in need of 

services (also called unruly); 

an adult. 

o  Delinquent acts are considered crimes whether they are committed by a child or 

o  A child in need of services (unruly) commits offenses that only apply to children, 

including truancy and ungovernable behavior. 

•  The proceeding in Juvenile Court was handled by a judicial referee or a judge; 

o  You may choose to include informal adjustments and diversions in your request. 
•  The individual believes he/she has good cause for the records to be destroyed early; and 
•  The individual doesn’t have any juvenile or criminal charges pending in any other court. 

Important!  If juvenile court received a referral alleging certain sex offenses or obscenity 
offenses, per North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Section 25-03.3-04, all juvenile case files and 
court records concerning the alleged offenses must be retained for twenty-five (25) years. 

The list of offenses is found in NDCC Chapters 12.1-20 and 12.1-27.2. 

STEP 1: REVIEW RULE 19(d) OF THE N. D. RULES OF JUVENILE PROCEDURE 

“(d) Early Destruction of Records.  A party who is the subject of a delinquency or unruly 
proceeding may petition the court for early destruction of records. The state's attorney of the 
county in which the records are held must be notified of the request. The judge may order the 
early destruction upon a showing of good cause to destroy the records by the party. The 
records may not be destroyed if it is known that the subject of the motion has criminal charges 
pending before any other court.”

STEP 3: SERVE COPIES OF THE COMPLETED FORMS ON THE STATE’S ATTORNEY 
OF THE COUNTY THAT HOLDS YOUR JUVENILE COURT RECORDS. 

The person who served the States Attorney completes an affidavit of service. 

Service means giving a copy of each of the following completed forms to the State’s Attorney.   

•  Notice of Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDRJuvP 19 Notice) 
•  Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDRJuvP 19 Motion) 
•  Brief in Support of Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDJuvP 19 Brief) 
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDRJuvP 19 Aff) 
•  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records 

(Proposed) (NDRJuvP 19 FFCL) 

•  Order for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (Proposed) (NDRJuvP 19 Order) 

You serve the State’s Attorney of the County that holds the records of your Juvenile Court 
proceeding(s). 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process and the document showing proof of 
service must be filed with the clerk of court in Step 4.  If proof of service isn’t filed, the Juvenile 
Court won’t read your completed forms or act on your request until you show that the State’s 
Attorney was served. 

Before serving copies of the completed forms on the State’s Attorney, contact the Juvenile 
Court in the County where you’ll file the motion.  Juvenile Court staff may agree to serve the 
State’s Attorney for you. 

If Juvenile Court staff won’t serve the State’s Attorney for you, you must arrange for the State’s 
Attorney to be served. 

Review Rule 7 of the N. D. Rules of Juvenile Procedure.  Rule 7 includes the six different 
methods to serve documents. You must decide which of the methods to use.  No matter which 
method you choose, you must prove to the Juvenile Court that copies of the documents were 
served as required by Rule 7.

STEP 4: FILE THE ORIGINAL, COMPLETED FORMS WITH THE JUVENILE COURT. 

Take the original, completed forms to the Juvenile Court in the County that holds your records. 

•  Notice of Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDRJuvP 19 Notice) 
•  Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDRJuvP 19 Motion) 
•  Brief in Support of Motion for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (NDJuvP 19 Brief)

•  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records 

(Proposed) (NDRJuvP 19 FFCL) 

•  Order for Early Destruction of Juvenile Records (Proposed) (NDRJuvP 19 Order) 
•  Proof of service of copies of the original, completed forms on the State’s Attorney. 

•  Depending on the method of service you used, you’ll file either the completed 
Affidavit of Service by Mail, the Affidavit of Service by Personal Delivery, or the 
Affidavit of Office Service 

You’re not required to pay a filing fee.  If you’re asked to pay a filing fee, contact the Juvenile 
Court Supervisor or Director in the County that holds your records for assistance. 

STEP 5: WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER THE FORMS AND SERVED AND FILED. 

The State’s Attorney has 14 days to respond to the motion.   

This doesn’t include the day of service.  In the response, the State’s Attorney will say whether 
they agree or disagree with your request for early destruction of your juvenile records. 

The judicial referee or judge assigned to your request may decide to schedule a hearing, or to 
make a decision without a hearing. 

If the judicial referee or judge decides to hold a hearing, you’ll be notified of the hearing date 
and time by mail.  Be prepared to prove everything you included in your completed forms.  The 
judicial referee or judge will make a decision after the hearing is held. 

If the judicial referee or judge decides to make a decision without a hearing, you’ll receive 
copies by mail of documents signed by the judicial referee or judge.  The documents will tell 
you what the judicial referee or judge decided.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
