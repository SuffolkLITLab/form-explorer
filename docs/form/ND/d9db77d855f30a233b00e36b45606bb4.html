Upon petition and after notice and hearing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, 

the court may appoint a conservator or make other protective order for cause as follows:

Appointment of a conservator or other protective order may be made in relation to the 
estate   and   affairs   of   a   minor   if   the   court   determines  by   a   preponderance   of   the 
evidence that a minor owns money or property that requires management or protection 
which cannot otherwise be provided, has or may have business affairs which may be 
jeopardized  or  prevented  by  the  minor's minority,   or  that  funds are  needed  for  the 
minor's support and education and that protection is necessary or desirable to obtain 
or provide funds.
Appointment of a conservator or other protective order may be made in relation to the 
estate and affairs of a person, including a minor, if the court determines by clear and 
convincing evidence:
a.

The person is unable to manage the person's property and affairs effectively for 
reasons such as mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, 
chronic use of drugs, or chronic intoxication;
The person is unable to manage the person's property and affairs effectively for 
reasons of confinement, detention by a foreign power, or disappearance; or
The   person   has   property  that  will   be   wasted   or   dissipated   unless   proper 
management  is provided,  or that  funds are needed for the support,  care, and 
welfare of the person or those entitled to be supported by the person and that 
protection is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide funds.

be protected and the spouse of the person to be protected or, if none, the parents of 
the person to be protected, must be served personally  by the petitioning party  with 
notice of the proceeding at least fourteen days before the date of hearing if they can 
be found within the state, or, if they cannot be found within the state, they, any other 
guardian or conservator, and any government agency paying benefits to the person 
sought to be protected, if the person seeking the appointment has knowledge of the 
existence   of   these   benefits,   must   be   given   notice   in   accordance   with   section 
30.1-03-01.   Waiver   by   the   person   to   be   protected   is   not   effective   unless   the 
proceedings are limited to payment of veterans' administration benefits, the person to 
be protected attends the hearing, or, unless minority is the reason for the proceeding, 
waiver is confirmed in an interview with the visitor.

2. Notice of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other initial protective order, 
and of any subsequent hearing, must be given to any person who has filed a request 
for notice under section 30.1-29-06 and to interested persons and other persons as 
the court may direct. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1, notice shall be 
given in accordance with section 30.1-03-01.

required by statute or court rule. The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the conservator if 
one has been appointed. A request is not effective unless it contains a statement showing the 
interest of the person making it and the person's address, or that of the person's attorney, and is 
effective   only   as   to   matters   occurring   after   the   filing.  Any   governmental   agency   paying   or 
planning to pay benefits to the person to be protected is  an interested person  in protective 
proceedings.

30.1-29-07. (5-407) Procedure concerning hearing and order on original petition.
1. Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order 
because of minority, the court shall set a date for hearing on the matters alleged in the 
petition. The proposed conservator, if any, shall attend the hearing unless excused by 
the court for good cause. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that 
the interests of the minor are or may be inadequately represented, it may appoint an 
attorney to serve as guardian ad litem for the minor, giving consideration to the choice 
of the minor if fourteen years of age or older. The duties of a guardian ad litem include:
a. Meeting, interviewing, and consulting with the person to be protected regarding 
the conservatorship proceeding, including explaining the purpose for the interview 
in the language, mode of communication, and terms the person is most likely to

conservator,   if   any,   shall   attend   the   hearing   unless   excused   by  the   court   for   good 
cause. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the 
person to be protected are or may be inadequately represented, the court shall appoint 
an attorney to serve as guardian ad litem for the person to be protected. The duties of 
a guardian ad litem include:

30.1-29-08. (5-408) Permissible court orders.
1.

b.

In determining  whether  appointment  of  a  conservator  is appropriate,  the court 
shall   consider   the   reports   ordered   by   the   court   under   this   subsection   from   a 
guardian   ad   litem   and   an   expert   examiner.   The   court,   guardian   ad   litem, 
petitioner,   or   person   to  be  protected   may  subpoena   the  expert   examiner   who 
prepared and submitted the report to appear, testify, and be cross-examined.
The person to be protected must be present at the hearing in person, unless good 
cause is shown for the absence. Good cause does not consist of the physical difficulty 
of the person to be protected to attend the hearing. The court shall take all necessary 
steps  to  make  the  courts and  court  proceedings  accessible  and understandable  to 
impaired persons. The court may convene temporarily, or for the entire proceeding, at 
any other location if it is in the best interest of the person to be protected.
In any case in which the veterans' administration is or may be an interested party, a 
certificate of an authorized official of the veterans' administration that the person to be 
protected has been found incapable of handling the benefits payable on examination 
in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the veterans' administration is 
prima facie evidence of the necessity for a conservator or other protective order.
After hearing, upon finding that  the appointment of a conservator or other protective 
order  is   appropriate,   the   court   shall   make   an   appointment   or   other   appropriate 
protective order.

c.

b.

The   court   shall   exercise   the  authority  conferred   in   this   chapter   consistent   with   the 
maximum self-reliance and independence of the protected person and make protective 
orders only to the extent necessitated by the protected person's actual mental and 
adaptive limitations and other conditions warranting the procedure.
The   court   has   the   following   powers   which   may  be   exercised   directly  or   through   a 
conservator in respect to the estate and affairs of protected persons:
a. While   a   petition   for   appointment   of   a   conservator   or   other   protective   order   is 
pending and after preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court has 
power to preserve and apply the property of the person to be protected as may 
be required for the benefit of the person to be protected or the benefit of the 
dependents of the person to be protected.
After   hearing   and   upon   determining   that   a   basis   for   an   appointment   or   other 
protective order exists with respect to a minor without other disability, the court 
has all those powers over the estate and affairs of the minor which are or might 
be necessary for the best interests of the minor, the minor's family, and members 
of the minor's household.
After hearing and upon determining that  appointment  of a conservator  or other 
protective order  is appropriate  with respect to a person for reasons other than 
minority, the court has, for the benefit of the person and members of the person's 
household, all the powers over the person's estate and affairs which the person 
could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will. 
These powers include power to make gifts, to convey or release the person's 
contingent and expectant interests in property, including marital property rights 
and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy, to exercise or release the 
person's   powers   as   trustee,   personal   representative,   custodian   for   minors, 
conservator, or donee of a power of appointment, to enter into contracts, to create 
revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the estate which may extend beyond 
the   person's   disability   or   life,   to   exercise   options   of   the   disabled   person   to 
purchase   securities   or   other   property,   to   exercise   the   person's   rights   to   elect 
options   and  change  beneficiaries under   insurance  and annuity  policies  and to 
surrender the policies for their cash value, to exercise the person's right to an 
elective share in the estate of the person's deceased spouse, and to renounce 
any interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer.
The   court   may   exercise   or   direct   the   exercise   of   its   authority   to   exercise   or 
release   powers   of   appointment   of   which   the   protected   person   is   donee,   to 

d.

Page No. 4

renounce interests, to make gifts in trust or otherwise exceeding twenty percent 
of any year's income of the estate, or to change beneficiaries under insurance 
and annuity policies, only if satisfied, after notice and hearing, that it is in the best 
interests   of   the   protected   person,   and   that   the   protected   person   either   is 
incapable of consenting or has consented to the proposed exercise of power.
An   order   made   pursuant   to   this   section   determining   that  appointment   of   a 
conservator or other protective order is appropriate has no effect on the capacity 
of the protected person.

e.

3. Unless   terminated   earlier   by   the   court,   an   order   appointing   or   reappointing   a 
conservator under this section is effective for up to five years. At least ninety days 
before   the   expiration   of   the   initial   order   of   appointment   or   any   following   order   of 
reappointment,   the   court   shall   request   and   consider   information   submitted   by   the 
conservator,   the  protected   person,   the  protected   person's  attorney,   if   any,   and  any 
interested persons regarding whether the need for a conservator continues to exist. If 
it is recommended the conservatorship continue, the court may appoint a guardian ad 
litem in accordance with section 30.1-29-07. The court shall hold a hearing on whether 
the   conservatorship   should   continue.   Following   the   hearing   and   consideration   of 
submitted information, the court may reappoint the conservator for up to another five 
years, allow the existing order to expire, or appoint a new conservator in accordance 
with this section. The supreme court, by rule or order, shall provide for regular review 
of conservatorships in existence on August 1, 2017.

30.1-29-09. (5-409) Protective arrangements and single transactions authorized.
1.

If it is established in a proper proceeding that a basis exists, as described in section 
30.1-29-01,   for   affecting   the   property   and   affairs   of   a   person,   the   court,   without 
appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct, or ratify any transaction necessary or 
desirable   to   achieve   any   security,   service,   or   care   arrangement   meeting   the 
foreseeable needs of the protected person. Protective arrangements include payment, 
delivery,   deposit,   or   retention   of   funds   or   property,   sale,   mortgage,   lease,   or   other 
transfer of property, entry into an annuity contract, a contract for life care, a deposit 
contract, a contract for training and education, or addition to or establishment of a 
suitable trust.

3.

2. When it has been established in a proper proceeding that a basis exists, as described 
in   section   30.1-29-01,   for   affecting   the   property  and   affairs   of   a   person,   the   court, 
without appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct, or ratify any contract, trust, or 
other  transaction  relating  to the  protected  person's  financial  affairs or   involving  the 
protected person's estate if the court determines that the transaction is in the best 
interests of the protected person.
Before approving a protective arrangement or other transaction under this section, the 
court shall consider the interests of creditors and dependents of the protected person 
and, in view of the protected person's disability, whether the protected person needs 
the   continuing   protection   of   a   conservator.   The   court   may   appoint   a   special 
conservator to assist in the accomplishment of any protective arrangement or other 
transaction authorized under this section who shall have the authority conferred by the 
order and serve until discharged by order, after report to the court of all matters done 
pursuant to the order of appointment.
This section does not apply to a guardian or conservator.

4.

30.1-29-10. (5-410) Who may be appointed conservator - Priorities.
1.

The court may appoint an individual, limited liability company, association, corporation, 
or other entity with general power to serve as trustee, as conservator of the estate of a 
protected person.

2. Unless lack of qualification or other good cause dictates the contrary, the court shall 
appoint   a   conservator   in   accordance   with   the   protected   person's   most   recent 
nomination in a durable power of attorney.

Page No. 5

b.

Except as provided in subsection 2, persons who are not disqualified have priority for 
appointment as conservator in the following order:
a.

A   conservator,   guardian   of   property,   or   other   like   fiduciary   appointed   or 
recognized   by   the   appropriate   court   of   any   other   jurisdiction   in   which   the 
protected person resides.
An individual or corporation nominated by the protected person by other means 
than provided for in subsection 2 if the protected person is fourteen or more years 
of age and, in the opinion of the court, has sufficient mental capacity to make an 
intelligent choice.
The spouse of the protected person.
An adult child of the protected person.
A parent of the protected person, or a person nominated by the will of a deceased 
parent.
Any relative of the protected person with whom the protected person has resided 
for more than six months prior to the filing of the petition.
A person nominated by the person who is caring for or paying benefits to the 
protected person.

c.
d.
e.

g.

f.

A person denominated in subdivision a, c, d, e, or f of subsection 3 may nominate, in 
writing, a substitute to serve instead and thereby transfer the priority to the substitute. 
With respect to persons having equal priority, the court is to select the one who is best 
qualified of those willing to serve. The court, for good cause, may pass over a person 
having higher priority and appoint a person having lower priority or no priority.

30.1-29-11. (5-411) Bond.
Except   as   provided   herein,   the   court   shall   require   a   conservator   to   furnish   a   bond 
conditioned upon faithful discharge of all duties of the trust according to law, with sureties as it 
shall specify. Unless reduced or waived by the court for good cause, the bond shall be in the 
amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator's control 
plus one year's estimated income, including veterans' administration benefits received during 
that year, minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the 
court for their removal and the value of any land which the fiduciary, by express limitation of 
power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. In lieu of sureties on a bond, 
the court  may  accept  other  security  for  the performance of  the  bond,  including a  pledge  of 
securities or a mortgage of land.

30.1-29-12. (5-412) Terms and requirements of bonds.
1.

The following requirements and provisions apply to any bond required under section 
30.1-29-11:
a. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly 

b.

and severally liable with the conservator and with each other.
By   executing   an   approved   bond   of   a   conservator,   the   surety  consents   to   the 
jurisdiction   of   the   court   which   issued   letters   to   the   primary   obligor   in   any 
proceeding pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the conservator and naming the 
surety as a party defendant. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the 
surety   or   mailed   to   the   surety   by   registered   or   certified   mail   at   the   surety's 
address   as   listed   with   the   court   where   the   bond   is   filed   and   to   the   surety's 
address as then known to the petitioner.

c. On petition of a successor conservator or any interested person, a proceeding 
may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the 
conservator.
The   bond   of   the   conservator   is   not   void   after   the   first   recovery   but   may   be 
proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.
2. No proceeding may be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an 

d.

action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.

30.1-29-13. (5-413) Acceptance of appointment - Consent to jurisdiction.
By accepting appointment, a conservator submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court 
in any proceeding, relating to the estate, that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice 
of   any   proceeding   shall   be   delivered   to   the   conservator,   or   mailed   to   the   conservator   by 
registered or certified mail at the conservator's address as listed in the petition for appointment 
or as thereafter reported to the court and to the conservator's address as then known to the 
petitioner.

30.1-29-14. (5-414) Compensation and expense.
1. When the estate is derived, in whole or in part, from money paid or being paid by the 
veterans' administration to the conservator or the conservator's predecessor for the 
benefit of the protected person, the compensation allowed from such money to the 
conservator shall be limited to five percent of the amount of money received from the 
agency during the period covered by the account, except that the court may allow a 
minimum   compensation   of   not   to   exceed   fifty   dollars   per   year.   No   commission   or 
compensation will be allowed for receipt of moneys or other assets received from a 
prior   fiduciary   nor   upon   the   amount   received   from   liquidation   of   loans   or   other 
investments.
If   not   otherwise   compensated   for   services   rendered,   any   lawyer,  expert   examiner, 
conservator, or special conservator appointed in a protective proceeding is entitled to 
reasonable compensation from the estate.

2.

30.1-29-15. (5-415) Death, resignation, or removal of conservator.
The court may remove a conservator for good cause, upon notice and hearing, or accept 
the resignation of a conservator. After a conservator's death, resignation, or removal, the court 
may appoint another conservator. A conservator so appointed succeeds to the title and powers 
of the predecessor.

30.1-29-16. (5-416) Petitions for orders subsequent to appointment.
1.

Any person interested in the welfare of a person for whom a conservator has been 
appointed may file a petition in the appointing court for an order:
a. Requiring bond or security or additional bond or security, or reducing bond;
b. Requiring an accounting for the administration of the trust;
c. Directing distribution;
d. Removing the conservator and appointing a temporary or successor conservator; 

or

2.

e. Granting other appropriate relief.
A   conservator   may   petition   the   appointing   court   for   instructions   concerning   the 
conservator's fiduciary responsibility.

3. Upon notice and hearing,  the court may give appropriate instructions or make any 

appropriate order.

30.1-29-17. (5-417) General duty of conservator.
In the exercise of conservator's powers, a conservator is to act as a fiduciary and shall 

observe the standards of care applicable to trustees.

30.1-29-18. (5-418) Inventory and records.
Within   ninety   days   after   appointment,   every   conservator   shall   prepare   and   file   with   the 
appointing court a complete inventory of the estate of the protected person together with the 
conservator's oath or affirmation that it is complete and accurate so far as the conservator is 
informed. The conservator shall provide a copy thereof to the protected person if the protected 
person   can   be   located,   has   attained   the   age   of   fourteen   years,   and   has   sufficient   mental 
capacity to understand these matters, and to any parent or guardian with whom the protected 
person resides. The conservator shall keep suitable records of the conservator's administration 
and exhibit the same on request of any interested person.

Page No. 7

30.1-29-19. (5-419) Annual reports and accounts.
1.

At least once annually and at other times as the court may direct, a conservator shall 
file a report and account with the court  regarding the exercise of powers and duties 
specified   in   the   court's   order   of   appointment.   The   report   must   describe   any 
expenditure and income affecting the protected person, any sale or transfer of property 
affecting   the   protected   person,   and   any   exercise   of   authority   by   the   conservator 
affecting the protected person.

2. On termination of the protected person's minority or disability, a conservator shall file a 
final   report   and   accounting   and   provide   a   copy   of   the   report   or   accounting   to   the 
protected person. The report or accounting must be filed with the clerk of district court. 
The filing of the report or accounting  does not constitute the court's approval of the 
report   or   accounting.   The   court   may   approve   a   report   and   settle   and   allow   an 
accounting only upon notice to the protected person and other interested persons who 
have made an appearance or requested notice of proceedings. Subject to appeal or 
vacation within the time permitted, an order, made upon notice and hearing, allowing 
an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to liabilities concerning the 
matters considered in connection therewith. An order, made upon notice and hearing, 
allowing   a   final   account   adjudicates   as   to   all   previously   unsettled   liabilities   of   the 
conservator to the protected person or the protected person's successors relating to 
the   conservatorship.   In   connection   with   any   account,   the   court   may   require   a 
conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in the conservator's control, to 
be   made   in   any   manner   the   court   may   specify.   The   office   of   the   state   court 
administrator   shall   provide   printed   forms   that   may   be   used   to   fulfill   reporting 
requirements. Any report must be similar in substance to the state court administrator's 
form. The forms must be available in the office of clerk of district court or obtainable 
through the supreme court's internet website.

3. Copies of the conservator's annual report to the court and of any other reports required 
by  the   court   must   be   mailed   by  the   conservator   to   the   protected   person   and   any 
interested persons designated by the court in its order. The protected person's copy 
must   be   accompanied   by   a   statement,   printed   with   not   less   than   double-spaced 
twelve-point   type,   of   the   protected   person's   right   to   seek   alteration,   limitation,   or 
termination of the conservatorship at any time.

30.1-29-20. (5-420) Conservators - Title by appointment.
The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property of 
the   protected   person,   presently   held   or   thereafter   acquired,   including   title   to   any   property 
theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys in fact, or to the part thereof 
specified in the order. An order specifying that only a part of the property of the protected person 
vests in the conservator creates a limited conservatorship. The appointment of a conservator is 
not a  transfer or  alienation within the meaning of  general  provisions of any federal or state 
statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will, or trust instrument imposing 
restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of the protected 
person's   rights   or   interest,   but   this   section   does   not   restrict   the   ability   of   persons   to   make 
specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.

30.1-29-21. (5-421) Recording of conservator's letters.
Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets, or the part thereof specified 
in the letters, of a protected person to the conservator. An order terminating a conservatorship is 
evidence   of   transfer   of   all   assets   of   the   estate   subjected   to   the   conservatorship   from   the 
conservator   to   the   protected   person   or   the   protected   person's   successors.   Subject   to   the 
requirements of general statutes governing the filing or recordation of documents of title to land 
or other property, letters of conservatorship, and orders terminating conservatorships, may be 
filed or recorded to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected 
person.

Page No. 8

30.1-29-22. (5-422) Sale, encumbrance, or transaction involving conflict of interest  - 

Voidable exceptions.

Any sale or encumbrance to a conservator, the conservator's spouse, agent, or attorney, or 
any corporation, limited liability company, or trust in which the conservator has a substantial 
beneficial interest, or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest is 
voidable unless the transaction is approved by the court, after notice to interested persons and 
others as directed by the court.

30.1-29-23. (5-423) Persons dealing with conservators - Protection.
A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for 
value   in   any   transaction   other   than   those   requiring   a   court   order   as   provided   in   section 
30.1-29-08   is   protected   as   if   the  conservator   properly  exercised   the  power.  The  fact   that   a 
person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the 
existence   of   a   power   or   the   propriety  of   its   exercise,   except   that   restrictions   on   powers   of 
conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 30.1-29-26 are effective as to 
third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or 
delivered to a conservator. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some 
procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of 
letters. The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable 
provisions   of   the   laws   relating   to   commercial   transactions   and   laws   simplifying   transfers   of 
securities by fiduciaries.

30.1-29-24. (5-424) Powers of conservator in administration.
1.

A  conservator   has   all   of   the   powers   conferred   herein   and   any   additional   powers 
conferred by law on trustees in this state. In addition, a conservator of the estate of an 
unmarried minor, as to whom no one has parental rights, has the duties and powers of 
a guardian of a minor described in section 30.1-27-09 until the minor marries, but the 
parental   rights   so   conferred   on   a   conservator   do   not   preclude   appointment   of   a 
guardian as provided by chapter 30.1-27.
A conservator  has power,  without  court  authorization or  confirmation,  to invest and 
reinvest funds of the estate as would a trustee.
A conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose for which the 
conservator was appointed, may act without court authorization or confirmation, to:
a. Collect, hold, and retain assets of the estate, including land in another state, until, 
in the conservator's judgment, disposition of the assets should be made, and the 
assets   may   be   retained   even   though   they   include   an   asset   in   which   the 
conservator is personally interested.

b. Receive additions to the estate.
c. Continue or participate in the operation of any business or other enterprise.
d.

Acquire an undivided interest in an estate asset in which the conservator, in any 
fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest.
Invest and reinvest estate assets in accordance with subsection 2.

e.
f. Deposit estate funds in a bank, including a bank operated by the conservator.
g.

Acquire or dispose of an estate asset, including land in another state for cash or 
on credit, at public or private sale, and to manage, develop, improve, exchange, 
partition, change the character of, or abandon an estate asset.

i.

h. Make   ordinary   or   extraordinary   repairs   or   alterations   in   buildings   or   other 
structures,   demolish   any   improvements,   and   raze   existing   or   erect   new   party 
walls or buildings.
Subdivide, develop, or dedicate land to public use, to make or obtain the vacation 
of plats and adjust boundaries, to adjust differences in valuation on exchange or 
to partition by giving or receiving considerations, and to dedicate easements to 
public use without consideration.
Enter for any purpose into a lease as lessor or lessee with or without option to 
purchase   or   renew   for   a   term   within   or   extending   beyond   the   term   of   the 
conservatorship.

j.

k.

Enter   into   a  lease   or   arrangement   for   exploration   and   removal   of   minerals   or 
other natural resources or enter into a pooling or unitization agreement.

l. Grant an option involving disposition of an estate asset, to take an option for the 

m.
n.

o.

acquisition of any asset.
Vote a security, in person or by general or limited proxy.
Pay calls, assessments, and any other sums chargeable or accruing against or 
on account of securities.
Sell or exercise stock or membership interest, subscription or conversion rights, 
to consent, directly or through a committee or other agent, to the reorganization, 
consolidation, merger, dissolution, or liquidation of a corporation, limited liability 
company, or other business enterprise.

t.

r.

s.

q.

u.

p. Hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of 
the  conservatorship   so  that   title   to  the  security  may  pass  by  delivery,   but   the 
conservator is liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the stock so 
held.
Insure   the   assets   of   the   estate   against   damage   or   loss,   and   the   conservator 
against liability with respect to third persons.
Borrow money to be repaid from estate assets or otherwise, to advance money 
for the protection of the estate  or the protected person, and for all expenses, 
losses, and liability sustained in the administration of the estate or because of the 
holding or ownership of any estate assets and the conservator has a lien on the 
estate as against the protected person for advances so made.
Pay   or   contest   any   claim,   to   settle   a   claim   by   or   against   the   estate   or   the 
protected   person   by   compromise,   arbitration,   or   otherwise,   and   to   release,   in 
whole or in part, any claim belonging to the estate to the extent that the claim is 
uncollectible.
Pay taxes, assessments, compensation of the conservator, and other expenses 
incurred in the collection, care, administration, and protection of the estate.
Allocate   items   of   income   or   expense   to   either   estate   income   or   principal,   as 
provided by law,  including creation of reserves out of income for depreciation, 
obsolescence, or amortization, or for depletion in mineral or timber properties.
Pay   any   sum   distributable   to   a   protected   person   or   the   protected   person's 
dependent without liability to the conservator, by paying the sum to the distributee 
or   by  paying   the   sum   for   the   use   of   the   distributee   either   to   the   distributee's 
guardian or, if none, to a relative or other person with custody of the distributee's 
person.
Employ persons,  including attorneys,  auditors,  investment  advisers,  or  agents, 
even though they are associated with the  conservator, to advise or  assist the 
conservator in the performance of the conservator's administrative duties, to act 
upon   their   recommendation   without   independent   investigation,   and   instead   of 
acting   personally,   to   employ   one   or   more   agents   to   perform   any   act   of 
administration, whether or not discretionary.
Prosecute or  defend actions, claims,  or proceedings in any jurisdiction  for the 
protection   of   estate   assets   and   of   the   conservator   in   the   performance   of   the 
conservator's duties.
Execute and deliver all instruments which will accomplish or facilitate the exercise 
of the powers vested in the conservator.

30.1-29-25. (5-425) Distributive duties and powers of conservator.
1.

A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court 
authorization   or   confirmation   for   the   support,   education,   care,   or   benefit   of   the 
protected   person   and   the   protected   person's   dependents   in   accordance   with   the 
following principles:
a.

The   conservator   is   to   consider   recommendations   relating   to   the   appropriate 
standard of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a 
parent or guardian, if any. The conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid 

Page No. 10

to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education, or care to the 
protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the 
protected  person unless the conservator  knows that the parent or  guardian is 
deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal 
duty   of   support,   or   unless   the   recommendations   are   clearly   not   in   the   best 
interests of the protected person.
The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the 
support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person with due regard to:
(1) The size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, and the 
likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able 
to manage the protected person's affairs  and the estate which has been 
conserved for the protected person.

(2) The accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of 

the protected person's household.

(3) Other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.
The   conservator   may   expend   funds   of   the   estate   for   the   support   of   persons 
legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the 
protected person's household, who are unable to support themselves, and who 
are in need of support.
Funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any 
person,  including the protected person,  to  reimburse for  expenditures  that  the 
conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the 
protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and 
advance   payments   are   customary   or   reasonably   necessary   under   the 
circumstances.

b.

c.

d.

2.

If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized 
by the preceding subsection, a conservator for a protected person other than a minor 
has power to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might 
have been expected to make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year 
twenty percent of the income from the estate.

3. When a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under subsection 2 of section 
30.1-29-01 attains majority, the minor's conservator, after meeting all prior claims and 
expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the 
former protected person as soon as possible.

5.

4. When   the   conservator   is   satisfied   that   a   protected   person's   disability   other   than 
minority has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of 
administration,   shall   pay  over   and   distribute   all   funds   and   properties   to  the   former 
protected person as soon as possible.
If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping 
any will of the deceased protected person which may have come into the conservator's 
possession, inform the executor or a beneficiary named therein that the conservator 
has   done   so,   and   retain   the   estate   for   delivery   to   a   duly   appointed   personal 
representative of the decedent or other persons entitled thereto. If after forty days from 
the   death   of   the   protected   person   no   other   person   has   been   appointed   personal 
representative and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the 
conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative 
so that the conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent's estate 
without additional or further appointment. Upon application for an order granting the 
powers   of   a   personal   representative   to   a   conservator,   after   notice   to   any   person 
demanding notice under section 30.1-13-04 and to any person nominated executor in 
any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power 
upon determining that there is no objection, and endorse the letters of the conservator 
to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has 
acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and 
entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment of 
a   personal   representative   as   provided   in   section   30.1-14-08   and   chapters   30.1-17 

Page No. 11

through   30.1-21,   except   that   estate   in   the   name   of   the   conservator,   after 
administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors without prior retransfer 
to the conservator as personal representative.

30.1-29-26. (5-426) Enlargement or limitation of powers of conservator.
Subject to the restrictions in subdivision d of subsection 2 of section 30.1-29-08, the court 
may  confer   on  a   conservator   at   the  time  of   appointment   or   later,   in   addition  to  the  powers 
conferred on the conservator by sections 30.1-29-24 and 30.1-29-25, any power which the court 
itself could exercise under subdivisions b and c of subsection 2 of section 30.1-29-08. The court 
may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a conservator otherwise conferred 
by sections 30.1-29-24 and 30.1-29-25, or previously conferred by the court, and may at any 
time relieve the conservator of any limitation. If the court limits any power  conferred on the 
conservator by sections 30.1-29-24 and 30.1-29-25, the limitation shall be endorsed upon the 
conservator's letters of appointment.

30.1-29-27. (5-427) Preservation of estate plan.
In   investing   the   estate,   and   in   selecting   assets   of   the   estate   for   distribution   under 
subsections   1   and   2   of   section   30.1-29-25,   in   utilizing   powers   of   revocation   or   withdrawal 
available for the support of the protected person, and exercisable by the conservator or the 
court, the conservator and the court should take into account any known estate plan of the 
protected   person,   including   the   protected   person's   will,   any   revocable   trust   of   which   the 
protected   person   is   settlor,   and   any   contract,   transfer,   or   joint   ownership   arrangement   with 
provisions for payment or transfer of benefits or interests at the protected person's death to 
another   or   others   which   the   protected   person   may   have   originated.   The   conservator   may 
examine the will of the protected person.

30.1-29-28. (5-428) Claims against protected person - Enforcement.
1.

A conservator must pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against 
the   protected   person   arising   before   or   after   the   conservatorship   upon   their 
presentation   and   allowance.  A  claim   may   be   presented   by   either   of   the   following 
methods:
a.

The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the 
claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount 
claimed.
The claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by 
rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the 
conservator.

b.

A  claim   is   deemed   presented   on   the   first   to   occur   of   either   receipt   of   the   written 
statement   of   claim   by   the   conservator,   or   the   filing   of   the   claim   with   the   court.  A 
presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the 
conservator to the claimant within sixty days after its presentation. The presentation of 
a  claim   tolls   any  statute   of   limitation   relating   to  the  claim   until   thirty  days   after   its 
disallowance.
A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of 
the claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and, 
upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate. If a 
proceeding  is   pending  against   a  protected   person  at   the  time  of   appointment   of   a 
conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party 
must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a 
claim against the estate.
If   it   appears   that   the  estate  in   conservatorship  is   likely  to  be  exhausted  before  all 
existing   claims   are   paid,   preference   is   to   be   given   to   prior   claims   for   the   care, 
maintenance,   and   education   of   the   protected   person   or   the   protected   person's 
dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.

30.1-29-29. (5-429) Individual liability of conservator.
1. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a conservator is not individually liable on a 
contract properly entered into in the conservator's fiduciary capacity in the course of 
administration of the estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's 
representative capacity and identify the estate in the contract.
The conservator is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control 
of property of the estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the 
estate only if the conservator is personally at fault.

2.

3. Claims based on contracts entered into by a conservator in the conservator's fiduciary 
capacity,  on obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate, or on torts 
committed in the course of administration of the estate, may be asserted against the 
estate by proceeding against the conservator in the conservator's fiduciary capacity, 
whether or not the conservator is individually liable therefor.
Any question of liability between the estate and the conservator individually may be 
determined   in   a   proceeding   for   accounting,   surcharge,   or   indemnification,   or   other 
appropriate proceeding or action.

4.

30.1-29-30. (5-430) Termination of proceeding.
The protected person, the protected person's personal representative, the conservator, or 
any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship. A protected 
person   seeking   termination   is   entitled   to   the   same   rights   and   procedures   as   in   an   original 
proceeding for a protective order. The court, upon determining, after notice and hearing, that the 
minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the conservatorship. 
Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to the 
protected person's successors subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or 
to conveyances from the conservator to the former protected person or the former protected 
person's successors to evidence the transfer.

30.1-29-31. (5-431) Payment of debt and delivery of property to foreign conservator 

without local proceedings.

Any   person   indebted   to   a   protected   person,   or   having   possession   of   property  or   of   an 
instrument evidencing a debt, stock, or chose in action belonging to a protected person may pay 
or deliver to a conservator, guardian of the estate, or other like fiduciary appointed by a court of 
the   state   of   residence   of   the   protected   person,   upon   being   presented   with   proof   of   the 
appointment and an affidavit made by the fiduciary or on the fiduciary's behalf stating:

1.
2.

That no protective proceeding relating to the protected person is pending in this state.
That the foreign conservator is entitled to payment or to receive delivery.

If   the   person   to   whom   the   affidavit   is   presented   is   not   aware   of   any  protective   proceeding 
pending in this state, payment or delivery in response to the demand and affidavit discharges 
the debtor or possessor.

30.1-29-32. (5-432) Delivery to foreign conservator.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
