      <pre>COLLECTING A JUDGMENT – FOR THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR 

An Informational Guide to North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves 
in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this informational 
guide isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process.  If you 
decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you must abide by the following: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.   This covers basic information for the 
person granted a judgment about collecting a North Dakota Small Claims or State District Court 
judgment.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the 
information provided.  The information can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel 
licensed in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

IMPORTANT! 

When a North Dakota Small Claims or State District Court orders judgment in your 
favor (you win), the court system DOESN’T collect the judgment for you. 

If the person who owes the money doesn’t pay voluntarily, you may need to take 
additional steps to get your money.  Following are some common judgment collection 
options available under North Dakota law.

NO FORMS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms available for any of the judgment collection 
options within this informational guide. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you must create and prepare your own legal documents.  
Names and descriptions of many of the documents you must create and prepare are found 
throughout this guide. 

A variety of General-Use templates are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the 
“District Court Civil” section.  You may find the General-Use templates of interest as a starting 
point for creating your own legal documents. 

You may find some of the forms in the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual of 
interest.  The Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual contains a variety of family law 
forms that were created for lawyers to use as examples in family law cases.  The Legal Services 
of North Dakota website is legalassist.org. 

(References to the Legal Services of North Dakota Family Law Manual are for your convenience 
only.  The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t endorse, warrant, or accept responsibility for the 
content or uses of the Family Law Manual. You must independently determine the legal 
sufficiency of the forms in the Family Law Manual.  Use at your own risk.)

If you’d like assistance creating any of your legal documents, consult a lawyer licensed to 
practice in North Dakota.  Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation. 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may agree to help you with part of your civil 
action, such as preparing legal documents, while you handle the rest of your civil action.  You 
and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center can’t assist you with creating any of your legal documents and 
can’t provide Limited Legal Representation.

KEEP GOOD RECORDS 

Keep good records of the steps you take to collect your judgment, when and how the 
judgment has been paid, and how much of the judgment has been paid. 

Remember that you may need to prove any or all of the following: 

•  You correctly took all required steps for the option, or options, you choose to collect the 

judgment. 

•  The amount of judgment interest you claim on any outstanding amount is correct. 
•  How much of the judgment you collected. 
•  Who paid the judgment and how much.

judgment and records of all other transactions related to the judgment. 

WHEN A JUDGMENT CREDITOR CAN START COLLECTING A JUDGMENT 

Generally, thirty days must have passed since the notice of entry of the judgment (or entry of a 
default judgment) before using the following judgment collection options. 

Review the laws and rules related to the civil action for any exceptions to this general rule. 

•  For example, when registering a foreign judgment (see Foreign Judgment in the 

Definitions section), NDCC Section 28-20.1-03 requires that ten days must have passed 
since filing the judgment before beginning any execution or other process to enforce the 
judgment.

 POST-JUDGMENT DISCOVERY TO IDENTIFY NON-EXEMPT ASSETS 

Overview: 

In aid of the judgment or execution of the judgment, the judgment creditor may obtain 
discovery from the judgment debtor.  The judgment creditor can use post-judgment discovery 
to identify the judgment debtor’s non-exempt assets before applying for a writ of execution. 

Basic information about two common methods of discovery, interrogatories and production of 
documents, is available below. 

Laws and Rules: 

discovery.

requirements and process for requesting answer to written interrogatories. 
o  Rule 34 of the Rules of Civil Procedure – Production of Documents, contains the 

requirements and process for requesting production of documents. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

Post-Judgment Discovery isn’t Filed with the Clerk of Court: 

Don’t file post-judgment discovery with the clerk of court unless: 

•  The discovery materials are being submitted to the court for disposition of a pending 

motion; 

•  The court orders the discovery material to be filed; or 
•  A judgment creditor, judgment debtor or person affected by post-judgment discovery 
certifies that the filing is necessary for safekeeping of the documents or exhibits, in 
which event the judgment creditor, judgment debtor or person affected by post-
judgment discovery must state the reasons safekeeping is necessary. 

Interrogatories: 

Interrogatories are written questions that are answered in writing under oath.  A party may ask 
interrogatories of any other party.  See Rule 33 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

electronically stored information or tangible things and permit them to be copied.  This request 
is available to any other party.  See Rule 34 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 

•  The request for production of documents must: 

o  Describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be

WRIT OF EXECUTION 

Overview: 

A writ of execution is a court order to a sheriff to seize a judgment debtor’s non-exempt 
property. 

There are two kinds of execution. 

•  The first kind of execution is against the property of the judgment debtor 
•  The second kind of execution is to deliver possession of the property and any damages 

for keeping the property from the judgment creditor. 

If the judgment requires the sale of property, the judgment may be enforced by a special writ 
of execution.  The special writ of execution must direct that the property be sold and the 
proceeds from the sale are used to pay the judgment and the costs of the sale. 

Generally, thirty days must have passed since the notice of entry of the judgment (or entry of a 
default judgment) before requesting a writ of execution.  Review the laws and rules related to 
the civil action for any exceptions to this general rule. 

A judgment creditor can apply for a writ of execution at any time within ten years after the 
court ordered the judgment. 

•  The judgment creditor must apply for a writ of execution in the same county that 

ordered the judgment. 

Laws and Rules: 

•  Rule 62 of the Rules of Civil Procedure Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment. 
•  Rule 69(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-21 Execution of the Judgment, contains requirements and process for 

writs of execution. 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-25 Proceedings Supplementary to the Execution.  See Page 9 of 20 

below for more information about this process. 

     

NDLSHC Info Guide

Collect Judgment-Creditor/Rev. Feb 2022 

Process: 

Apply for a writ of execution with the clerk of court of the North Dakota state district court or 
small claims court that ordered the judgment. 

If you registered a foreign judgment (see Foreign Judgment in the Definitions section), apply for 
a writ of execution with the clerk of court of the North Dakota state district court where you 
registered your foreign judgment. 

You may be required to pay a fee. 

Formatting examples of an application for a writ of execution and a writ of execution are found 
at the end of this guide. 

•  The examples are included only as general examples of formatting.  The ND Legal Self 

Help Center doesn’t guarantee or certify their accuracy or legal sufficiency.  Use at your 
own risk. 

The North Dakota state district court or small claims court that granted the judgment may issue 
a writ of execution to the sheriff of any county in North Dakota. 

•  More than one writ of execution may be issued at the same time to different sheriffs. 

You’ll also be required to prepare and file an Affidavit of Identification before the court will 
issue a writ of execution.  This is a notarized document that provides the name and address of 
the judgment debtor. 

•  A blank Affidavit of Identification form is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. Scroll 

to the “Miscellaneous” section. 

If the court issues a writ of execution, the clerk of court will give or send the writ to the sheriff, 
depending on local procedures. 

Once the sheriff serves (gives) the writ of execution and notice of levy on the judgment debtor, 
the judgment debtor has ten days to file a claim for exemption. 

•  Property that is protected is found in NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions. 

Service information and resources are available at the ND Legal Self Help Center website: 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section.

PROCEEDINGS SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE EXECUTION 

Overview: 

If an execution returns unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied, a judgment creditor can ask the court 
to order the judgment debtor to appear and provide information about assets. 

If it appears to the court that the judgment debtor has property which the judgment debtor 
unjustly refuses to apply to the satisfaction of the execution, the court may require the 
judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning the judgment debtor's property. 

The hearing will be held in the county where the judgment debtor resides, if the judgment 
debtor is a resident of North Dakota.  Otherwise, the hearing may be held where ordered by 
the court. 

Laws and Rules: 

Process: 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-25 Proceedings Supplementary to the Execution. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  Rule 3.2 of the Rules of Court Motions, contains process and requirements for making a 

motion (request) to a North Dakota state court in an existing case. 

The process to make a request to a North Dakota state court in an existing case is called a 
motion.  The judgment creditor must serve and file a written motion to the court to make the 
request. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions available for making a motion 
to request proceedings supplementary to the execution.   

General information about the motion process is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 
Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section and click on the “Making a Motion” link. 

First,  create your motion documents. 

Generally, the following documents must be submitted to the court to start a motion.  The 
motion is filed with the same case number as the judgment, or the same case number assigned 
to the registered foreign judgment.

•  Motion; 

o  Tells the court and all parties what you are requesting from the court. 

•  Brief in support of motion; 

o  A written document that explains why the party filing the motion should have 

the motion granted.  A brief takes the relevant laws or rules and applies them to 
the facts of a particular situation. 
•  Your affidavit or declaration to support the motion; 

o  A written statement of the facts about which you have first-hand knowledge. 

•  Other supporting documents (other affidavits, exhibits, etc.); and 
•  Confidential Information Form 

(ndcourts.gov/Media/Default/Legal%20Resources/rules/ndrct/Appendix-H.pdf). 

General use motion templates are available at the “Making a Motion” link that you may use as 
starting points to create your own motion documents. 

Second,  serve copies of your motion documents on all other parties in your case.  File the 

originals of your motion documents and proof of service with the clerk of court. 

Copies of the motion documents must be served on the parties as required by Rule of Civil 
Procedure 5.  Service information and resources are available at the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website: ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section. 

The original motion documents and the documents showing proof of service must be filed with 
the clerk of court.   

Third,  if a hearing is scheduled, attend the hearing. 

If it appears to the court from the motion documents that the judgment debtor has property 
which the judgment debtor unjustly refuses to apply to the satisfaction of the execution, the 
court may require the judgment debtor to appear and answer concerning the judgment 
debtor's property. 

The hearing will be held in the county where the judgment debtor resides, if the judgment 
debtor is a resident of North Dakota.  Otherwise, the hearing may be held where ordered by 
the court.

JUDGMENT LIEN AGAINST REAL PROPERTY (REAL ESTATE) 

Overview: 

The judgment acts as a lien against the non-exempt real property (real estate) located in the 
county where the judgment is docketed, and for ten years from the original docketing of the 
judgment. 

The ten year lien timeframe also applies to non-exempt real property (real estate) the 
judgment debtor acquires after the docketing of the original judgment. 

•  The homestead is exempt property.  If the judgment debtor has real property that 
qualifies as their homestead, the judgment lien doesn’t apply to the homestead. 

This isn’t a direct collection of money, however, the judgment lien prevents the judgment 
debtor from selling or mortgaging the real property (real estate) until the judgment is paid or 
expires. 

Laws and Rules: 

•  Rule 58 of the Rules of Civil Procedure Entry and Notice of Entry of Judgment. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-20 Judgments.  See specifically: 

o  Section 28-20-13: Docketing judgment - Transcript to other counties - Lien on 

real property. 

o  Section 28-20-16: How judgment docketed. 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor 

that cannot be used to satisfy a judgment. 

•  NDCC Chapter 47-18 Homestead, contains the definition of homestead and 

requirements related to the homestead. 

Process: 

The judgment must be docketed in the North Dakota county where the real property (real 
estate) is located. 

First,  the judgment creditor must file an affidavit of identification of the judgment debtor with 

the clerk of court.  This is a notarized document that provides the name and address of the 
judgment debtor. 

•  A blank Affidavit of Identification form is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll 

to the “Miscellaneous” section. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 11 of 20 

Collect Judgment-Creditor/Rev. Feb 2022 

Second,  the clerk of court will docket the judgment. 

If non-exempt real property (real estate) of the judgment debtor is located in a different 
North Dakota county than the county where the judgment was granted, make a written 
request to the clerk of court of the county that granted the judgment. 

After receiving the written request and the fee to transcribe the judgment, the clerk of court of 
the county that granted the judgment can transcribe the judgment to other North Dakota 
county clerks of court.

GARNISHMENT 

Overview: 

Garnishment is the act of taking the judgment debtor’s money from a third party to satisfy a 
judgment.  For example, taking the judgment debtor’s wages from their employer, or the 
judgment debtor’s money from their bank. 

After the court orders a judgment, the judgment creditor can issue a summons against any 
person, any public corporation, the United States, the State of North Dakota or any institution, 
department, or agency of the state, indebted to or having any property in possession or under 
control, which belongs to the judgment debtor. 

Please note that the person who has control of the judgment debtor’s property, i.e. wages, is 
called the Garnishee.  For example, a judgment debtor’s employer is the Garnishee. 

Garnishment is the only way to require an employer to withhold a portion of the judgment 
debtor’s wages for payment of the judgment. 

Laws and Rules: 

•  Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure Persons Subject to Jurisdiction; Process; Service. 
•  Rule 69(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. 
•  NDCC Chapter 28-21 Execution of the Judgment, contains requirements and process for 

•  NDCC Chapter 28-22 Exemptions, contains exempt property of the judgment debtor

If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that a 
lawyer is required to follow. 

Lawyer Resources

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income.  Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income.  The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make court 

appearances for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
