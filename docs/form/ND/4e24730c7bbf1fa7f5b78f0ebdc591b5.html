SECTION ONE: Information About the Forms Packet and the Two Steps 
in all Motions to Modify Primary Residential Responsibility. 
(DON’T skip this section!) 

YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS ONLY IF: 

You have a North Dakota state district court judgment that established residential responsibility 
(custody) and/or parenting time (visitation); AND 

1.  Another party in the case made a written motion to the Court to change, or modify, 

the judgment so that: 

o  A judgment that currently awards shared or equal residential responsibility is 

modified to award one parent primary residential responsibility, or 

o  A judgment that currently awards one parent primary residential responsibility is 
modified to award primary residential responsibility to the other parent; AND 

2.  One of the following applies to your situation: 

o 

It has been 2 years or more since the original judgment or the most recently 
amended judgment; or 

o  Your current parenting plan allows for modification before two years have 
passed when an event or circumstance occurs, and the parent making the 
motion says that the event or circumstance has occurred. 

IF YOU DON’T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHO MAY USE 
THIS PACKET OF FORMS 

If your situation doesn’t meet the requirements of who may use this packet of forms, you 
may answer a motion to modify primary residential responsibility.  However, neither the ND 
court system nor the ND Legal Self Help Center currently has a packet of forms for you to use. 

If you need to answer a motion to modify where less than 2 years have passed since the most 
recent judgment and an earlier timeframe isn’t included in your parenting plan, you’ll need to 
create all of your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer to create the documents for you. 

A Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility Research Guide is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/custody.  Scroll to the “Modifying Primary Residential 
Responsibility (Custody) Research Guides” section.

The Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility Research Guide is your starting point for your 
research into answering a motion to modify primary residential responsibility in an order of a 
North Dakota state district court.  The research guide also includes general information about 
the legal documents you’ll need to create in order to answer a motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility in an existing North Dakota state district court judgment. 

THE PARTIES 

Plaintiff: The parent who is listed as the Plaintiff in the original family law action that 
established residential responsibility (custody) and parenting time (visitation). 

Defendant: The parent who is listed as the Defendant in the original family law action that 
established residential responsibility (custody) and parenting time (visitation). 

Moving party: The parent who brought the motion to modify primary residential responsibility.    
The moving party in the motion may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. 

Opposing party: The other parent who didn’t bring the motion.  In other words, the parent who 
completes and signs the forms in this packet.  (Also called the Non-moving party.) 

MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IS A TWO-STEP MOTION PROCESS 

(Please note that in 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “custody” to 
“residential responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

When a North Dakota state district court awards residential responsibility in a family law case, 
such as divorce, legal separation, paternity action, or other action to establish parenting rights 
and responsibilities, either parent may make a motion to ask the court to modify primary 
residential responsibility in the existing case, if certain requirements are met. 

In general, there is a 2 year time limit before either parent may request modifications to 
primary residential responsibility.  However, one exception to the 2 year time limit is when the 
parenting plan allows for an earlier time frame when an event or circumstance occurs. 

Overview of the Two-Step Motion Process: 

First Step: The parent requesting modification, the Moving party, must make a written prima 
facie case for modifying primary residential responsibility in their motion documents. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 4 of 27 

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

The parent responding to the written motion, the Opposing party, has 14 days to answer the 
motion in writing.  The Opposing party’s answer documents may challenge the credibility or the 
sufficiency of the Moving party’s written argument. 

If the Opposing party doesn’t serve and file a written answer to the motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility, the Judicial Officer may consider this an admission by the Opposing 
party that the motion has merit. 

The Judicial Officer assigned to the case reviews the Moving party’s motion documents and the 
Opposing party’s answer to motion documents to determine whether the Moving party made a 
prima facie case for modifying primary residential responsibility. 

If the Moving party doesn’t make a prima facie case in writing, the motion is dismissed and 
doesn’t move to the second step. 

Second Step: An in-person, evidentiary hearing is scheduled only if the Judicial Officer assigned 
to the case finds that the Moving party made their prima facie case in writing in their motion 
documents.  At the hearing, the Moving party must present evidence to prove the allegations in 
their motion for modifying primary residential responsibility.  The Opposing party may present 
their evidence to dispute or counter the Moving party’s evidence. 

A filing fee of $30.00 is required. 

FEES 

• 

If you’re unable to afford the filing fee, you may file a written request to waive the 
$30.00 filing fee with the District Court. 

•  Forms and instructions for a fee waiver request are available at 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. 

Other fees may apply.  The fees include, but aren’t limited to: 

•  Service fees 
Varies 
•  Copy of Documents  $.10 per page, $1.00 minimum

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions). 

“PRIMA FACIE CASE” – CASE LAW RESEARCH: 

When the decision of a motion to modify primary residential responsibility is appealed from a 
North Dakota state district court to the North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes 
their opinion to explain how and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal 
the way they did. The opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding 
later cases with similar facts and issues. 

“Prima facie case” isn’t defined in the laws enacted by the North Dakota Legislature.  You’ll 
need to research case law to define “prima facie case” and interpret what it means for your 
situation.

your office. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion to modify was personally delivered or left at 

your office. 

You have 17 days to answer if you were served the motion to modify by mail or third party 
commercial carrier. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion to modify was mailed. 
•  Keep the envelope with the postmarked date for reference. 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

Review the forms and instructions: 

Read these instructions carefully.  Review the individual forms.  Determine if the forms apply to 
your situation. If you don’t know if you should use this packet of forms, consult a lawyer who is

Review the judgment the Moving party is asking the Court to modify.  Identify the paragraphs 
the Moving party wants the court to modify.  Outline how the laws and your facts support your 
answer to the motion to modify. 

Decide if you’ll reference other supporting documentation in your motion documents.  For 
example, if you identify individuals with first-hand knowledge of your situation, decide if you 
want the individual to complete an affidavit. 

Gather information: 

For example: 

•  At least one copy of the original judgment that established residential responsibility 
and/or parenting time, OR, if the original judgment has been amended, the most 
recently amended judgment. 

•  Supporting documentation you plan to refer to in your answer to motion documents. 

o  Any supporting documentation to which you refer in your answer to motion 

documents must be served on the Moving party and filed with the Court.  (See

Step Six: 
Judicial Officer Reviews Motion and Answer to Motion Documents to Decide if 
Evidentiary Hearing will be Granted. 

The Judicial Officer Reviews the Motion Documents Submitted by the Moving Party and 
Opposing Party: 

After the deadline for serving and filing the answer brief and other supporting documentation 
has passed, the motion is considered to be submitted to the District Court. 

The Judicial Officer assigned to the case reviews the motion documents submitted by both the 
Moving party and you, the Opposing party, to determine if the Moving party made a prima 
facie case for modification. 

The Moving party has the burden of proving their prima facie case in their motion documents, 
even if you, the Opposing party, didn’t serve and file an answer brief and other supporting 
documentation. 

The Judicial Officer’s decision will be in writing and sent to each party. 

If the Judicial Officer Decides the Moving Party DIDN’T Make a Prima Facie Case: 

After reviewing all of the motion documents, the Judicial Officer will decide if the Moving party 
made their written prima facie case for modification. 

If the Judicial Officer decides the Moving party DIDN’T make a written prima facie case, the 
motion is dismissed and an evidentiary hearing isn’t scheduled. 

If the Judicial Officer Decides the Moving Party DID Make a Prima Facie Case: 

If the Judicial Officer decides the Moving party DID make a written prima facie case, an 
evidentiary hearing is scheduled.  You’ll be notified by mail of the date, time and location of the 
hearing. 

The Moving party must prove the allegations in their written motion documents at the 
evidentiary hearing.  You must be prepared to challenge the Moving party’s evidence at the 
evidentiary hearing.

SECTION THREE: Steps for the Evidentiary Hearing (Step Two). 

EVIDENTIARY HEARING FORMS IN THE PACKET (Step Two) 

Following are forms for the Second Step in the motion process.  Please note that forms 
AREN’T available for every part of the evidentiary hearing process.  You’ll need to create 
many of your own legal documents for this step. 

Reminder: There is no guarantee that using these forms and following the procedures outlined 
will result in the Court dismissing the motion to modify primary residential responsibility 
following an evidentiary hearing.  Representing yourself at an evidentiary hearing is a complex 
and confusing process.  If you feel you need assistance, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota.

Step One: 
Required Meeting; Prepare Joint Informational Statement; File Joint 
Informational Statement. 

Review Rule 8.3.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-
resources/rules/ndrct/8-3-1. 

After the Judicial Officer decides the Moving party met the requirements for an evidentiary 
hearing, the Opposing party and the Moving party are required to meet in-person or by 
electronic means to prepare a Joint Informational Statement.   

The completed and signed Joint Informational Statement is filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Individual Counties May Have a Different Joint Informational Statement Process: 

Rule 8.3.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court gives the basic requirements and timelines for 
preparing and filing a Joint Informational Statement. 

However, individual counties may have a process that is different than the basic requirements 
and timelines of Rule 8.3.1.  If the County’s process is different, a written notice, order or other 
document you receive from the Court will include the County’s process. 

If the County’s process is different, comply with that County’s requirements and timelines. 

If the County’s Process ISN’T Different, Comply with the Following Requirements and 
Timelines of Rule 8.3.1: 

You’ll Receive Written Notice of the Evidentiary Hearing: 

After the Judicial Officer decides the Moving party met the requirements for an evidentiary 
hearing, you and the Moving party will receive the Judicial Officer’s decision in writing.  You and 
the Moving party will also receive written notice of the date, time and location of the 
evidentiary hearing. 

(Notice of the hearing may be mailed to you separately.) 

Meet with the Moving Party Within 30 Days of the Order for an Evidentiary Hearing: 

You, the Opposing party, and the Moving party are required to meet in-person or by electronic 
means within 30 days of the order for an evidentiary hearing.  The purpose of the meeting is to 
prepare a Joint Informational Statement. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 21 of 27 

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

A Joint Informational Statement form may be included with the written notice, order or other 
document you receive from the Court.  A Joint Informational Statement form is also included in 
this packet. 

File the completed and signed Joint Informational Statement form with the Clerk of District 
Court.  You must file the completed and signed form within 7 days after the meeting. 

Step Two: 
Prepare for the Evidentiary Hearing. 

The order for the evidentiary hearing includes the date, time and location of the hearing. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible. 

Review pre-trial or trial guidebooks for self-represented individuals and lawyers: 

Preparing for an evidentiary hearing is often a complex and confusing process. Review pre-trial 
and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local public or academic 
library may have resources available. 

Gather documentation: 

For example: 

You’ll be required to prove the allegations in your answer to motion documents.  Gather the 
documentation you believe will prove your side. 

•  At least one copy of the original judgment that established residential responsibility 
and/or parenting time, OR, if the original judgment has been amended, the most 
recently amended judgment. 

•  Your copies of the motion documents the Moving party served on you. 
•  Your copies of the answer to motion documents you filed with the Court in the First 

Step. 

•  Your copies of the supporting documentation you filed with the Court in the First Step. 
•  List of witnesses, including the individuals whose affidavits you filed with the Court in 

support of your answer to motion in the First Step.

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully! 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern how you object to evidence the Moving party wants 
to admit at the hearing.  The Rules also govern whether your evidence is admitted for 
consideration at the hearing.  

The starting point for admitting evidence at the hearing is whether the evidence is relevant.  
The party asking for evidence to be admitted must show a reasonable connection between the 
evidence they want the Judicial Officer to consider and the legal claim they are trying to prove. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the 
“District Court Civil” section. 

Subpoenas: 

If you require a witness to appear at the hearing or require production of documents, 
electronically stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District 
Court to issue a subpoena. Only a Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a 
subpoena. A Subpoena Informational Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/subpoenas. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing: 

At minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments.  

Step Three: 
The Evidentiary Hearing. 

The evidentiary hearing is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the Judicial 
Officer assigned to your case.  The Moving party and Opposing party each have an opportunity 
to tell their side of the facts and argue how the laws apply to the situation. The Judicial Officer 
weighs the facts and arguments presented by the Moving party and Opposing party and either 
grants or dismisses the motion to modify primary residential responsibility. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible.

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

Don’t be late! 

Don’t be late for your evidentiary hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason why you 
can’t go to the evidentiary hearing on the scheduled day or will be late, call the Clerk of District 
Court’s office as soon as possible. 

Be aware that even if you contact the Clerk of District Court’s office, the Judicial Officer may 
decide to hold the evidentiary hearing without you. 

Bring the information, documents, etc. that you prepared for the hearing: 

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc. that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
evidentiary hearing.  Bring the outline of what you want to say. 

Before the hearing begins: 

Organize your files and paperwork on your assigned table in the courtroom so you can easily 
locate information as needed. 

Be prepared to take notes during the hearing. 

Conduct of the hearing: 

In general, an evidentiary hearing proceeds in the following order: 

•  The evidentiary hearing officially begins when all are asked to rise when the Judicial 

Officer comes into the courtroom: 

o  The Judicial Officer begins the evidentiary hearing by identifying any documents 
that were submitted to the Clerk of District Court and identifying the parties. 

•  Opening Statements: 

o 

If the Judicial Officer allows opening statements, the Moving party usually goes 
first. 

o  An opening statement describes the issues and states what the party expects to 

prove during the hearing. 

•  The Moving Party Presents their Case: 

o  The Moving party has the burden of proving the allegations in their motion 

documents. 

o  The Moving party may call individuals with first-hand knowledge to testify. 
o  The Moving party may testify on their own behalf. 
o  You, the Opposing party, may object to the evidence the Moving party presents.  

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern how you object to evidence. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 24 of 27 

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

•  You, the Opposing Party, have the Option to Cross-Examine the Moving Party’s 

Witnesses: 

o  After the Moving party finishes direct questioning of their witness, you have a 

chance to ask their witness questions. This is called cross-examination. 
If the Moving party testifies on their own behalf, you may cross-examine them. 
o 
o  You may only ask questions about the topics covered during the Moving party’s 

direct questioning of their witness. 

•  You, the Opposing Party, Present your Case: 

o  You may present your evidence, including witnesses with first-hand knowledge. 
o  You may testify on your own behalf. 
o  The Moving party may object to the evidence you present.  The North Dakota 
Rules of Evidence govern how the Moving party objects to your evidence. 

•  The Moving Party has the Option to Cross-Examine your Witnesses: 

o  After you finish direct questioning of your witness, the Moving party has the 

chance to cross-examine your witness. 
If you testify on your own behalf, the Moving party may cross-examine you. 
o 
o  The Moving party may only ask questions about the topics covered during your 

direct questioning of your witness. 

•  Closing Arguments: 

o 

If the Judicial Officer allows closing arguments, the Moving party usually goes 
first. 

o  A closing argument is a summary of the evidence presented at the hearing and 
an argument to the Judicial Officer on how the motion should be decided. 

The Judicial Officer May Decide the Motion at the End of the Hearing OR Decide at a Later 
Date: 

At the end of the hearing, the Judicial Officer may make a final decision on the motion or may 
decide to make a final decision at a later date. 

If the Judicial Officer makes a final decision at the end of the hearing, the Judicial Officer may 
require the party who won to prepare an amended judgment that includes the modifications to 
primary residential responsibility. 

If the Judicial Officer DOESN’T make a final decision at the end of the hearing, the Judicial 
Officer will make a decision at a later date.  You’ll receive the Judicial Officer’s decision in 
writing. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 25 of 27 

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

The Judicial Officer May Require You to Prepare a Proposed Order to Amend Judgment and a 
Proposed Amended Judgment: 

An order to amend judgment explains why the Judicial Officer decided you met the 
requirements to modify primary residential responsibility, and lists the exact modifications to 
the current judgment.  An order to amend judgment is signed by the Judicial Officer. 

An amended judgment is a recreation of the current judgment with all of the modifications 
from the order to amend judgment.  An amended judgment is signed by either the Judicial 
Officer or the Clerk of Court. 

If you are required to prepare a proposed order to amend judgment and a proposed amended 
judgment, you must serve copies on all parties, and file proof of service with the Clerk of 
District Court. 

•  Go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action for information about 
service and affidavit of service forms.  Review the information in the “Service After a 
District Court Civil Action Has Started” section. 

The Judicial Officer will decide whether your proposed order to amend judgment and a 
proposed amended judgment are appropriate. 

If the Judicial Officer decides they are appropriate, the Judicial Officer will sign and date the 
proposed order to amend judgment, and either the Judicial Officer or the Clerk of Court will 
sign the proposed amended judgment. 

The order to amend judgment and the amended judgment aren’t official until appropriately 
signed and dated. 

Step Four: 
Appealing the Final Order. 

There are up to two ways to request a review of a final order in a motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility.   

Review of a Judicial Referee Final Order by a District Court Judge: 

If a Judicial Referee issued the final order in a motion to modify primary residential 
responsibility, either party may file a written request for review by a District Court Judge. 

If a party decides to file a request, the written request for review must: 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 26 of 27 

Modify PRR OP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

•  Be filed with the District Court within 7 days after service of the Notice of the Right to 

Review; and 

•  State the reasons the party requests the review. 

The District Court Judge who reviews the Judicial Referee’s final order may: 

•  Adopt the Judicial Referee’s findings in the final order; 
•  Send the final order back to the Judicial Referee for additional findings; or 
•  Reject the Judicial Referee’s findings in the final order. 

o 

If the District Court Judge rejects the Judicial Referee’s findings, the Judge must 
issue their own findings of fact, with or without a hearing. 

Parties aren’t required to request a review of a Judicial Referee’s final order.  A party may skip 
this option and appeal the final order to the North Dakota Supreme Court. 

Appeal a District Court Final Order to the North Dakota Supreme Court 

Either party may appeal a final order in a motion to modify primary residential responsibility to 
the North Dakota Supreme Court. 

The Notice of Appeal must be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within sixty (60) days of 
the District Court Judicial Officer’s final order. 

A guide to the North Dakota Supreme Court appeals process can be found at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/district-court-appeal-to-supreme-court.
