An Informational Guide to a North Dakota State District Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this 
informational guide isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court 
process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

• 

If you would like to learn more about finding a lawyer to represent you, go to

INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO WRITE A COMPLAINT FOR A  
CIVIL ACTION IN A NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT 

BEFORE you write your complaint, review the Guide to a District Court Civil Action. 

WHAT IS A COMPLAINT? 

A Complaint in a civil action is a document from the Plaintiff which states the claims against the 
Defendant and makes a request for relief.     

Both a Summons and Complaint are required to start a civil action in district court. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE COMPLAINT FORMS? 

No, because there are many different varieties of civil cases, the ND Legal Self Help Center 
doesn’t have Complaint forms.  If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to write your 
own Complaint.   

An example of a complaint starts on page 5 of this Informational Guide. 

A variety of General-Use template forms are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  
Scroll to the “District Court Civil” section.  You may find the General-Use template forms of 
interest as a starting point for creating your own Complaint. 

Also review the following on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center webpage: 

•  How to Research you Legal Issue 
•  Guide to a District Court Civil Action  
•  Starting a District Court Civil Action 

IS THERE HELP AVAILABLE FOR CREATING LEGAL DOCUMENTS? 

If you’d like assistance creating your complaint or other legal documents, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota.  Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  
Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may agree to help you with part of your civil 
action, such as preparing legal documents, while you handle the rest of your civil action.  You 
and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

How to Write a Complaint/Jun 2021 

WHO ARE THE PARTIES IN A COMPLAINT? 

Plaintiff – The party who starts the civil action by serving a summons and complaint.  There can 
be more than one Plaintiff. 

Defendant – The party who is served the summons and complaint by the Plaintiff.  There can be 
more than on Defendant. 

DEFINITIONS 

Jurisdiction 

Before starting a civil action, the Plaintiff must determine if the North Dakota State District 
Courts have jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the power of a court to inquire into the facts, apply the 
law, and determine and pronounce judgment. 

Generally speaking, there are two types of jurisdiction, subject matter and personal. The 
Plaintiff must show how the court has both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction 
over the Plaintiff’s civil action.  

•  Subject Matter Jurisdiction is the court’s power to hear and determine the type of case 
or controversy involved in the civil action. Subject matter jurisdiction comes from the 
constitution and statutes. The parties can’t agree to consent to or waive subject matter 
jurisdiction. Start your subject matter jurisdiction legal research at How to Research 
Your Legal Issue. 

•  Personal Jurisdiction the court’s power over the parties in a civil action. Rule 4 of the 
North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the definition of a “person” and the 
requirements for exercising personal jurisdiction over a person. A party can voluntarily 
submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court.  

Venue (Location of Civil Action)  

Venue means the place, or geographical location, of the court that will hear the civil action. The 
Plaintiff must determine the proper venue for their civil action. Venue requirements may be 
found in the laws related to the subject matter of the civil action. Venue requirements may also 
be found in North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-04.  

Claim or Cause of Action 

A statement of the legal wrong (such as negligence or breach of contract) for which the plaintiff 
seeks legal relief.  (“Represent Yourself in Court: Prepare & Try a Winning Civil Case,” Paul 
Bergman, Sara Berman, NOLO, 2019.)

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make court 

appearances for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
