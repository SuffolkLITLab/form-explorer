      <pre>GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION 

An Informational Guide to North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

This is a basic guide through the process of a civil action in North Dakota State District Court.  
This guide is not a complete statement of the laws and rules that apply to civil actions in North 
Dakota State District Court. 

Caution!  Civil actions are often a complex and confusing process.  You are held to the same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or 
procedures.  This informational guide gives only the basics of the process.  You will need to 
conduct additional research to prepare. 

The information contained in this guide cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel 
licensed in North Dakota.  If you are unsure whether you should use the information, contact a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

You are not required to hire an attorney to access the court system.  If you decide to represent 
yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that a lawyer is required to 
follow. 

Go to the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website for links to the following: 

•  North Dakota Century Code (State laws/statutes) and the North Dakota Constitution;

egal Research Resources for North Dakota Laws and Court Rules 

Civil actions are often a complex and confusing process.  Self-represented individuals are held 
to same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if the self-represented individual 
doesn’t understand the rules or procedures.  The self-represented individual will need to 
conduct their own legal research throughout the civil action. 

  L

How to Research Your Legal Issue 

Information and resources for legal research are available through the North Dakota Legal Self 
Help Center.  Go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Legal Research” section.” 

North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.) 

The North Dakota Century Code, also referred to as N.D.C.C., contains the laws enacted by the 
North Dakota State Legislature.  The laws within the North Dakota Century Code are also called 
statutes. 

The North Dakota Century Code is available at http://www.legis.nd.gov/general-
information/north-dakota-century-code.  The North Dakota Century Code is also available in 
print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

North Dakota Supreme Court Case Law (Opinions) 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota State District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 4 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way they did.  The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

North Dakota Supreme Court case law is available at www.ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Supreme 
Court” link, then the “Docket Search” link.    North Dakota Supreme Court case law is also 
available in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

North Dakota Court Rules 

Court rules govern how a civil action makes its way to North Dakota State District Court and 
how the civil action is conducted. 

North Dakota court rules are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.  North 
Dakota court rules are also available in print in many North Dakota public and academic 
libraries. 

Pattern Jury Instructions 

In civil actions where jury trials are permitted and requested, the judge instructs the jury 
concerning the law involved in the action.  The North Dakota Pattern Jury Instruction 
Commission has developed pattern jury instructions that may be used in civil actions. 

The Commission researches the laws and their requirements in order to develop pattern 
instructions. Then, the Commission drafts and publishes the Pattern Jury Instructions.  

If the civil action can be decided by a jury, the Pattern Jury Instructions can be a useful starting 
point for research.  The Pattern Jury Instructions are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help.  Scroll to the “Legal Research” section. 

Evidence is information presented to a judge, a judicial referee, or a jury for the purpose of 
establishing the truth or falsity of an allegation.  Evidence includes witness testimony, 
documents, etc. 

Evidence is gathered informally and formally at different stages of a civil action. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the 
“District Court Civil” section. 

Evidence

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

The party who starts a civil action with a summons and complaint is called the Plaintiff.  There 
can be more than one Plaintiff. 

The party who is served with a summons and complaint requesting civil legal action against 
them is called the Defendant.  There can be more than one Defendant. 

Parties to a Petition 

The party who starts a civil action with a summons and petition is called the Petitioner.  There 
can be more than one Petitioner. 

The party who is served with a summons and petition requesting civil legal action against them 
is called the Respondent.  There can be more than one Respondent. 

For the purpose of simplicity, the terms “Complaint,” “Plaintiff,” and “Defendant” will be 
used throughout the rest of this Guide, but the terms include petitions, petitioners and 
respondents. 

urisdiction 

  J

Before starting a civil action, the Plaintiff must determine if the North Dakota State District 
Courts have jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction is the power of a court to inquire into the facts, apply the 
law, and determine and pronounce judgment.   

Generally speaking, there are two types of jurisdiction, subject matter and personal.  The 
Plaintiff must show how the court has both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction 
over the Plaintiff’s civil action. 

Subject Matter Jurisdiction 

Subject matter jurisdiction is the court’s power to hear and determine the type of case or 
controversy involved in the civil action.   

Subject matter jurisdiction comes from the constitution and statutes.  The parties cannot agree 
to, consent to or waive subject matter jurisdiction. 

Parties to a Complaint

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

Personal Jurisdiction 

Personal jurisdiction is the court’s power over the parties in a civil action. 

Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the definition of a “person” and the 
requirements for exercising personal jurisdiction over a person.  A party can voluntarily submit 
to the personal jurisdiction of a court. 

enue (Location of Civil Action) 

Venue means the place, or geographical location, of the court that will hear the civil action.  The 
Plaintiff must determine the proper venue for their civil action. 

Venue requirements may be found in the laws related to the subject matter of the civil action.  
Venue requirements may also be found in North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-04.  

alculating Time Periods 

Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure describes how to calculate time periods 
during a civil action. 

onfidential Information in Documents Filed in a Civil Action 

Court records are generally available to the public, and anyone can request to look in almost 
any court file.  However, certain information is required to remain confidential, even if it is part 
of a public court record. 

The Plaintiff and Defendant are solely responsible for making sure confidential information 
does not appear in the documents they prepare.  Rule 3.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court 
describes the requirements.

• 
• 

The last four (4) digits of the social security number and taxpayer identification 
number 
The year of birth

If documents include references to confidential information, the party who files, or intends to 
file, the documents must prepare a Confidential Information form.  The form must contain the 
full confidential information that is referenced in the documents.   

The Confidential Information form is filed when the action is filed with the court.  The 
information on the form is not placed in a publicly accessible portion of the file. 

See the example of the Confidential Information form in Appendix H of the North Dakota Rules 
of Court. 

tarting a Civil Action 

  S

In North Dakota, a civil action starts with service of a summons on the Defendant.  A copy of 
the complaint must be served with the summons, unless the Defendant is served by 
publication. 

In North Dakota, a summons and complaint are not required to be filed with the court to start a 
civil action. 

See the Filing Documents with the District Court section below for more information about 
filing. 

Summons 

A summons directs the Defendant to answer the complaint within a certain amount of time.  
The summons notifies the Defendant that a default judgment will be taken against them if the 
Defendant does not answer. 

Certain information must be included in the summons.  Requirements are found in Rule 4 of the 
North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.  An example of a civil summons is available in the 
Appendix of Forms to the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 8 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

A summons in divorce, separation, or actions to establish parental rights and responsibilities 
has additional requirements.  See Rule 8.4 of the North Dakota Rules of Court and the example 
in Appendix A of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

The following forms are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Summons form – Civil Actions 
•  Summons (Petition) form – Civil Actions 
•  Summons form – Divorce or Separation Actions 
•  Summons form – Actions to Establish Parental Rights and Responsibilities 

Complaint 

A complaint is a written demand or request for judgment granting the relief the Plaintiff is 
seeking. 

Rule 8 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure requires that the complaint describe in 
short, plain statements the claim showing that the Plaintiff is entitled to relief, and a demand 
for relief.  See the Appendix of Forms to the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for examples 
of civil complaints. 

The requirements for complaints apply to the following types of documents: 

•  Complaint – original written demand or request for judgment granting the relief the 

Plaintiff is seeking. 

•  Counterclaim – written demand or request for judgment granting the relief the 

Defendant is seeking.  The counterclaim is included with the Defendant’s answer to the 
Plaintiff’s complaint.  See Rule 13 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for 
counterclaims. 

•  Crossclaim – written demand or request for judgment granting the relief a Plaintiff is 
seeking against a co-Plaintiff on the same side of the action.  See Rule 13 of the North 
Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for crossclaims. 

•  Third-party claim – written demand or request for judgment granting the relief a third-
party person is seeking.  See Rule 14 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for 
requirements related to third-party claims.

Service to Start a Civil Action 

Service to start a civil action, also called service of process, requires delivery of the summons 
and a copy of the complaint to the Defendant.  The Plaintiff is required to notify the Defendant 
of the claims and to give the Defendant time to respond. 

The summons and a copy of complaint must be delivered in specific ways.  See Rule 4 of the 
North Dakota Rule of Civil Procedure for the requirements. 

For information about service to start a civil action, go to the “District Court Civil” section on 
the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

If the Defendant is not represented by a lawyer, the Plaintiff serves the Defendant.  If the 
Defendant is known to be represented by a lawyer, the Plaintiff must serve the lawyer instead 
of the Defendant. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed. 

The proof of service to start a civil action tells the court when, how, and where the Defendant 
was served.  An affidavit of service gives the court proof of service. 

The Plaintiff notifies the Defendant of the civil action by serving the summons and a copy of the 
complaint on the Defendant.  The Defendant has twenty-one (21) days after service to respond 
or “answer” the complaint. 

See Rule 12 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for more information about time to 
serve the answer on the Plaintiff. 

Answer 

An answer is a written response by a Defendant to a complaint.   

Rule 8(b) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure requires that an answer admit or deny 
each of the claims in the complaint.  If a Defendant does not have enough information to admit 
or deny a claim, the Defendant must say so.  If a Defendant fails to deny a claim, the claim is 
considered admitted by the Defendant. 

The answer must also state defenses to each of the claims in short, plain statements.

See Rule 8(b) for information on how to admit or deny each claim in the complaint.  See the 
Appendix of Forms to the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for an example of presenting 
defenses in an answer. 

The following checklist and form are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Answering a Civil Summons and Complaint – Checklist 
•  Answer form 

Affirmative Defenses 

An affirmative defense is a legal reason the Plaintiff should lose, even if the Plaintiff’s claims are 
true.  For example, expiration of the time allowed by law to bring a civil action, or statute of 
limitations, is an affirmative defense. 

Rule 8(c) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure includes a list of affirmative defenses.  
The list does not include all possible affirmative defenses. 

Affirmative defenses must be stated in the answer.  A Defendant may not have any affirmative 
defenses.   

In general, failure to state an affirmative defense results in a waiver of the defense and cannot 
be brought up later in the action. 

See Rule 8 and Rule 12 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for affirmative defense 
requirements. 

See the Appendix of Forms to the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for an example of 
presenting defenses in an answer. 

Defenses allowed by Motion 

Some defenses can be made in a motion, rather than in the answer.   Rule 12 of the North 
Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure lists the defenses that can be made by motion, and when and 
how the motions can be made. 

For information on motions in a civil action, go to the Motions section below.   

Counterclaim 

A counterclaim is a written demand or request to the court for judgment granting the relief the 
Defendant is seeking.  A counterclaim allows the Defendant to bring claims against the Plaintiff.   

The counterclaim is included with the Defendant’s answer to the Plaintiff’s complaint.  Rule 13 
of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure describes the requirements for counterclaims.  

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 11 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

The counterclaim must meet all the requirements of a complaint.  See the Starting A Civil Action 
section above. 

There are two types of counterclaims: compulsory and permissive.   

Compulsory counterclaims are claims that arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as 
the claims in the Plaintiff’s complaint; and do not require adding another party over whom the 
court does not have jurisdiction. 

In general, failure to include a compulsory counterclaim in the Defendant’s answer results in a 
waiver of that claim.  The Defendant cannot assert that claim later in the action, or bring the 
claim in a different action.  A Defendant might not have any compulsory counterclaims. 

Permissive counterclaims are claims against the Plaintiff that do not arise out of the same 
transaction or occurrence as the claims in the Plaintiff’s complaint. 

In general, failure to include a permissive counterclaim does not waive the Defendant’s claim 
against the Plaintiff.  The claim can be brought in a different action.  A Defendant might not 
have any permissive counterclaims. 

The following checklist and form are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Answering a Civil Summons and Complaint – Checklist 
•  Answer and Counterclaim form 

Confidential Information in Documents Filed in a Civil Action 

See the Confidential Information in Documents Filed in a Civil Action section above. 

Service of the Answer 

Service after a civil action has started requires that parties deliver documents filed, or intended 
to file, with the court to all other parties in the civil action.  See Rule 5 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Civil Procedure for the requirements. 

For information about service after a civil action has been started, go to the “District Court 
Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

If a party is not represented by a lawyer, serve the party.  If a party is known to be represented 
by a lawyer, serve the lawyer instead of the party. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed.

The proof of service for documents served after a civil action has been started tells the court 
when, how, and where the party or parties were served.  An affidavit of service gives the court 
proof of service. 

Filing the Answer with the District Court 

In North Dakota, a summons and complaint are not required to be filed with the court to start a 
civil action.  See the Filing Documents with the District Court section below for more 
information about filing and notice of filing. 

After the summons and complaint are filed with the District Court, the party that filed the 
summons and complaint must service notice of filing on the other parties. 

The Defendant must file the answer within a reasonable amount of time after being served the 
notice of filing the summons and complaint. 

***Proof of service of the answer on the Plaintiff must be filed with the answer.*** 

The Defendant must serve notice of filing the answer on the Plaintiff. 

nswer to Counterclaim; Reply to Answer 

When a Defendant includes counterclaims in the answer to the Plaintiff’s complaint, the 
Plaintiff must serve a written response, or “answer,” to the counterclaims twenty-one (21) days 
after service of the Defendant’s Answer and Counterclaim.   

If the Defendant does not include counterclaims in the answer, the Plaintiff can reply to the 
answer if the court gives permission. 

See the Answering a Complaint section above for information about answers.

document(s) must be filed with the court.  For information about service of documents, go to 
the Service link on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

When to File the Summons and Complaint 

In North Dakota, a civil action starts with service of a summons and a copy of the complaint on 
the Defendant.   

A summons and complaint are not required to be filed with the court to start a civil action. 

There are actions that a court cannot take until the summons and complaint are filed, including 
(but not limited to): 

•  Requests for orders from the District Court; 
•  Subpoenas issued by the Clerk of Court. 

Other actions that cannot be taken until the summons and complaint are filed may be found in 
the laws or rules related to the civil action. 

***Proof of service of the summons and complaint must be filed with the summons and 
complaint.***  See the Starting a Civil Action section above for information about service to 
start a civil action. 

When the Defendant Can File the Summons and Complaint 

The Defendant can demand that the Plaintiff file the summons and complaint, or the Defendant 
can file the summons and complaint. 

Rule 5(d)(2) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure describes the requirements. 

If the Defendant demands that the Plaintiff file the summons and complaint: 

• 

•  The demand must be written. 
•  The demand must contain notice that if the complaint is not filed within 20 days, service 
of the summons will be void, unless, after motion made within 60 days after service of 
the demand for filing, the court finds excusable neglect. 
If the Plaintiff is represented by a lawyer, the demand must be served on the lawyer 
under Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.  If the Plaintiff is not 
represented by a lawyer, the demand must be served on the Plaintiff under Rule 4(d) of 
the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure . 
If the Plaintiff does not file the complaint within 20 days after service of the demand for 
filing, service of the summons is void.

How to File Documents in a Civil Action 

In general, the original document, rather than a copy, is filed with the court. 

*** Proof of service of the document(s) must be filed with the court.***  For information about 
service of documents, go to the “District Court Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self 
Help Center website. 

The Clerk of Court accepts documents for filing in a civil action.  Documents must meet the 
requirements of Rule 3.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court.   

Documents that do not meet the requirements of Rule 3.1 above may not be filed.  Documents 
filed in the wrong county will be returned to the filing party. 

When a summons and complaint are accepted by the Clerk of Court for filing, the Clerk of Court 
will assign a case number. 

Clerk of District Court contact information by county is found on the North Dakota Supreme 
Court website at www.ndcourts.gov.  

Filing Fees 

A filing fee is an amount of money, set by law, that a party must pay when filing documents in 
an action.  Filling fee amounts can be found in North Dakota Century Code Chapter 27-05.2 and 
by calling the clerk of court in the county where the documents will be filed. 

In general, the filing fees for District Court are: 

•  $80.00 to file a Summons and Complaint (or Petition) 
•  $50.00 to file an Answer to a Summons and Complaint (or Petition) 
•  $30.00 to file a Motion or an Answer to a Motion to modify an order for alimony, 

property division, child support, or child custody

If a type of document requires payment of a filing fee, the filing fee is paid before the document 
is filed. 

If a party cannot pay filing fees because of financial hardship, forms are available to ask the 
court to file documents in a civil action without paying the required filing fee.  The forms are 
found online at the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

(The filing fee for Small Claims Court is $10.00.  Forms and instructions for bringing or 
answering a claim in Small Claims court are found online at the North Dakota Legal Self Help 
Center website.) 

Notice of Filing 

Rule 5(d)(2) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure describes the requirements. 

The party that files the summons and complaint must serve notice of filing on all other parties.   

The notice of filing and proof of service of the notice of filing on all other parties must be filed 
with the Clerk of Court. 

The Defendant must serve notice of filing the answer on the Plaintiff. 

The Defendant must file the notice of filing and proof of service of the notice of filing on the 
Plaintiff with the Clerk of Court. 

For information about service of documents after a civil action has been started, go to the 
“District Court Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

A motion is a request to the Court to issue an order for a specific purpose.  Motions are made 
after the summons and complaint are filed with the court.  Motions cannot be used to start a 
civil action. 

The basic requirements for motions are found in Rule 6, Rule 7 and Rule 43 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Civil Procedure; and Rule 3.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court.

See the rules that apply to the type of motion being made and the laws that apply to the 
subject matter of the civil action for additional motion requirements. 

The party making the motion is called the moving party. 

•  The moving party in a motion may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. 

The party answering the motion is called the opposing party. 

A motion can request an order for the kinds of relief described in the rules and in the laws that 
apply to the subject matter of the civil action. 

Motions may be decided entirely on the documents submitted by the parties.  A party can make 
a timely request for an oral argument or an evidentiary hearing on the motion.  Rule 3.2 of the 
North Dakota Rules of Court describes how to make a timely request for an oral argument or an 
evidentiary hearing on the motion.  (See also Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.) 

The Appendix of Forms to the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure includes examples of some 
motion forms. 

Making a Motion 

A motion in a civil action must: 

•  Be in writing, unless the motion is made during hearing or trial; 
•  Specifically state the legal authority in rule and law that supports the request and state 

the specific facts that support the request; and 

•  State the relief sought from the court. 

A written motion in a civil action is made up of a set of documents, including: 

•  Notice of Motion; 
•  Motion; 
•  Brief in support of motion; 
•  Affidavit in support of motion; and 
•  Other supporting documents. 

     

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 17 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

A Notice of Motion is a required written notice to the opposing party that the moving party will 
request an order.  The Notice of Motion must state whether the motion will be decided on the 
written motion documents or whether the moving party has requested an oral argument or an 
evidentiary hearing on the motion.  If the moving party requests an oral argument or an 
evidentiary hearing, the Notice of Motion must include the date, time and location of the oral 
argument or evidentiary hearing.  (An opposing party may request a hearing, even if the moving 
party does not.) 

A Motion is a required written request to the court for an order.  The request is a short, plain 
statement that includes the specific rules and laws that support the request. 

A Brief in support of motion is a required written explanation of why the moving party should 
have the motion granted.  A brief takes the specific rules and laws that support the request and 
explains how they apply to the facts of a particular situation.  Facts referred to in the brief 
should also appear in the affidavit. 

If the moving party does not file a brief, the court may consider the failure an admission by the 
moving party that the motion does not have merit.  

An Affidavit in support of motion is a required written statement of fact of the moving party, 
which is made under oath.  Facts referred to in the brief should also appear in the affidavit.  The 
affidavit must be signed by the moving party in the presence of a notary public or clerk of court. 

Other supporting documents may be submitted with the required motion documents. 

Copies of the motion documents must be served on the opposing party or parties.  See the 
Service subsection below. 

The original motion documents must be filed with the clerk of court in the county where the 
existing civil action is filed.  See the Filing Documents with the District Court section above. 

Even if an answer brief is not served and filed by the opposing party, the moving party must still 
prove to the court that it is entitled to the relief requested.

Answering a Motion 

The moving party notifies the opposing party of the motion by serving copies of the motion 
documents on the opposing party.  The opposing party generally has fourteen (14) days after 
service to serve and file an answer brief and other supporting documents on the moving party.  

An answer is a written response to the motion by the opposing party. 

An answer to a motion in a civil action is made up of a set of documents, including: 

•  Answer brief; 
•  Affidavit in support of answer brief;  
•  Other supporting documents; and 
•  Notice of hearing on the motion. 

An Answer brief is a required written answer to the motion by the opposing party.  An answer 
brief takes the relevant laws or rules and explains how they apply to the facts of a particular 
situation.  Facts referred to in the answer brief should also appear in the affidavit. 

If the opposing party does not file an answer brief, the court may consider the failure an 
admission by the opposing party that the motion has merit.  

An Affidavit in support of the answer brief is a required written statement of fact of the 
opposing party, which is made under oath.  Facts referred to in the answer brief should also 
appear in the affidavit.  The affidavit must be signed by the opposing party in the presence of a 
notary public or clerk of court. 

Other supporting documents may be submitted with the required motion documents. 

Notice of Hearing on the motion is required only if the opposing party requests an oral 
argument or an evidentiary hearing on the motion.  The opposing party may request an oral 
argument or an evidentiary hearing, even if the moving party requested a decision on the 
written documents.  The opposing party must include the date, time and location of the oral 
argument or evidentiary hearing in the Notice of Hearing on motion. 

The Notice of Hearing on a motion can be a separate document, or the first section of the 
answer brief. 

The copies of the answer to motion documents must be served on the moving party or parties.  
See the Service subsection below. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 19 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

The originals of the answer to motion documents must be filed with the clerk of court in the 
county where the existing civil action is filed.  See the Filing Documents with the District Court 
section above.

Replying to the Answer 

After service of the opposing party’s answer documents, the moving party may serve and file a 
reply brief on the opposing party.  The moving party has seven (7) days after service of the 
opposing party’s answer documents to serve and file a reply brief and supporting documents. 

Requesting a Hearing on a Motion 

The party requesting a hearing on a motion must schedule a time for the oral argument or 
evidentiary hearing by contacting the clerk of court where the civil action is filed. 

The party requesting the motion must serve a notice of the oral argument or evidentiary 
hearing on all other parties. 

Requests for an oral argument or an evidentiary hearing on the motion must be made no later 
than seven (7) days after expiration of the time for filing the answer brief.

Service 

The moving party and opposing party must serve copies of their motion documents on the 
other parties in the civil action.  For information about service after a civil action has been 
started, go to the “District Court Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center 
website. 

***If a party requests an evidentiary hearing on the motion, the copies of motion documents 
must be served on the other party or parties at least twenty-one (21) days before the 
scheduled date of the evidentiary hearing.***

If a party is not represented by a lawyer, serve the party.  If a party is known to be represented 
by a lawyer, serve the lawyer instead of the party. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed. 

The proof of service for documents served after a civil action has been started tells the court 
when, how, and where the party or parties were served.  An affidavit of service gives the court 
proof of service.  

vidence 

  E

Evidence is information presented to a judge, a judicial referee, or a jury for the purpose of 
establishing the truth or falsity of an allegation.  Evidence includes witness testimony, 
documents, etc. 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern the type of evidence that can be presented, how to 
present evidence, and how to object to evidence. 

The following research guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Evidence Research Guide 

Gathering Evidence 

Evidence is gathered informally and formally at different stages of a civil action. 

Informal evidence gathering is when a party gets information on their own from cooperative 
sources, before and after the civil action starts. 

Discovery is formal evidence gathering from other parties or non-parties in the civil action.  
Discovery does not begin until after the civil action starts. 

Relevant Evidence 

The starting point for presenting or objecting to evidence is whether the evidence is relevant. 

Rule 401 of the North Dakota Rules of Evidence gives the test for relevance: 

“1. It has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without 
the evidence; and 

2. The fact is of consequence in determining the action.” 
 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 21 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

Discovery in a civil action is a formal process where a party asks the other party or non-party for 
information. 

See Rules 26 through 37 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for types of discovery 
available. 

Also see the North Dakota Rules of Evidence. 

Caution! Discovery is often a complex and confusing process. Self-represented individuals are 
held to same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if they don’t understand the 
rules or procedures.  Conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Public and 
academic libraries may have resources available. 

Discovery is not filed with the clerk of court unless:  

•  The discovery materials are being submitted to the court for disposition of a pending 

motion; 

•  The court orders the discovery material to be filed; or 
•  A party certifies that the filing is necessary for safekeeping of the documents or exhibits 
pending completion of the civil action, in which event the party must state the reasons 
safekeeping is necessary. 

Three Common Types of Discovery 

Three common types of discovery are interrogatories, production of documents, and requests 
for admission.  Review the discovery rules for other types of discovery available in civil actions. 

Interrogatories – Rule 33 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: Written questions that 
are answered in writing under oath. 

A party may ask interrogatories of any other party. 

•  An interrogatory may relate to any matter that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b) of 

the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

•  There is a limit of no more than fifty (50) written interrogatories, including discrete 

subparts.

•  The interrogatories and answers/objections to the interrogatories must be served on 

the parties as required by Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

o  The interrogatories and answers/objections to the interrogatories are not filed 

with the clerk of court except as listed above. 

•  The interrogatories must be answered by the party to whom they are directed. 
•  The answers/objections to the interrogatories must be served on the requesting party 

within thirty (30) days of being served the interrogatories. 

Production of Documents – Rule 34 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: Written 
request to produce discoverable documents, electronically stored information or tangible 
things and permit them to be copied. 

This request is available only to any other party. 

•  The request for production of documents must: 

o  Describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be 

o  Specify a reasonable time, place and manner for the inspection and for 

performing the related acts; and 

o  Specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be 

inspected;

be served on the parties as required by Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 

o  The requests for production of documents and answers/objections to the 
request are not filed with the clerk of court except as listed above. 
•  The answers/objections to the requests must be served on the requesting party within 

30 days of being served the requests. 

Requests for Admission – Rule 36 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: Written request 
to admit the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b) of the North Dakota Rules of 
Civil Procedure. 

This request is available only to any other party. 

•  The request for admission must relate to: 

o  The facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and 
o  The genuineness of any described documents. 

•  Requests for admission may be served on the plaintiff after the civil action starts.

30 days of being served the requests.  Review Rule 36 for limited exceptions to this 
timeline. 

o  A matter is admitted if an answer or objection is not served within the timeline. 

For information about service after a civil action has been started, go to the “District Court 
Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

Discovery Sanctions 

When a party fails to make or cooperate in discovery, the other party may make a motion to 
the court for discovery sanctions. 

See Rule 37 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for discovery sanction requirements, 
options and process information. 

A subpoena is the process to require the attendance of a non-party witness at deposition, 
hearing or trial.  A subpoena is also the process to require a non-party to produce documents, 
electronically stored information or tangible things; or to require the inspection of premises. 

Before a self-represented individual may use a subpoena, the following must be filed with the 
court: 

•  The summons; 
•  The complaint; and  
•  Proof of service of the summons and complaint on each Defendant. 

See Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for the subpoena process and 
requirements.  See also Rule 5(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for additional 
subpoena requirements. 

 

See the Motions Section above. 

ubpoenas 

  S

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 24 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

Subpoenas may be used by a party in a civil action to require a person to do the following at a 
specific time and place: 

•  Attend and testify at a deposition, hearing or trial; 
•  Produce the documents listed in the subpoena; 
•  Produce the electronically stored information listed in the subpoena; 
•  Produce the tangible things listed in the subpoena (the tangible things must be in the 

person’s possession, custody or control); or 

•  Permit the inspection of the premises listed in the subpoena. 

If a party wants to require a person to do more than one of the actions listed above, the party 
may include the actions in one subpoena, or use a separate subpoena for each action. 

Only a Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party can issue a subpoena in a civil action.  When you 
represent yourself in a civil action, you cannot issue a subpoena on your own. 

When a party in a civil action requests a subpoena from the Clerk of Court of the county where 
the civil action is filed, the Clerk of Court shall issue a subpoena to the party.  The Clerk of Court 
cannot issue subpoenas until after the civil action is filed. 

The subpoena will be signed by the clerk, but will otherwise be blank.  The party requesting the 
subpoena must complete the subpoena before arranging for service of the subpoena. 

See the Filing Documents with the District Court section above for more information about 
filing the summons and complaint and notice of filing. 

Information Needed to Request and Prepare a Subpoena 

Gather the following information before requesting a subpoena from the Clerk of Court: 

•  Names of the parties in the civil action, as listed in the caption of the summons and/or 

complaint; 

county; 

•  The name of the court where the civil action is filed, including the judicial district and 

•  The civil case number; 
•  Name and address of the person to whom the subpoena is directed; 
•  The date, time and place of the deposition, hearing or trial, if the subpoena will require 

•  The method of recording testimony, if the subpoena will require the person’s 

the person’s attendance; 

attendance at a deposition; 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Self Help” link. 

Page 25 of 36 

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

•  The amount of the witness fees, mileage and travel expenses, if the subpoena will 

require the person’s attendance; 

o 

If the subpoena requires the person’s attendance and you do not include 
payment of one day’s witness fees, mileage and travel expenses with the 
subpoena, the person does not need to obey the subpoena.  To calculate fees 
and expenses, see North Dakota Century Code Sections 31-01-16, 44-08-04 and 
54-06-09. 

•  A list of the specific documents, electronically stored information or tangible things, if 

the subpoena will require their production; 

•  The address of the premises, if the subpoena will require inspection. 

The subpoena may need to include additional information.  Review Rule 45 carefully to 
determine if a particular subpoena should include additional information.   

If your subpoena requires only pre-trial or prehearing production of documents, 
electronically stored information, or tangible things or the inspection of premises, the 
text of the notice in Rule 45(f) must be included in the subpoena. 

Service of the Subpoena 

The party who requested the subpoena arranges for service of the subpoena on the person to 
whom the subpoena is directed. 

If the subpoena requires the person’s attendance and you do not include payment of 
one day’s witness fees, mileage and travel expenses with the subpoena, the person does 
not need to obey the subpoena.  If the fees, mileage and travel expenses will be paid by 
the state or a political subdivision, you do not need to include payment with the 
subpoena. 

Subpoenas must be served by one of the options in Rule 4(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  Review Rule 4(d) carefully! 

General information about Rule 4 service requirements is available at the “District Court Civil” 
section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

When Notice is Required Before the Subpoena is Served 

There are situations where notice must be served before the actual subpoena can be served.

Review Rule 45(b) carefully to determine if notice must be served before the actual subpoena 
can be served. 

•  Rule 27, Rule 30 and Rule 34 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure include 
requirements for notice of deposition and notice of demand for production or 
inspection.  Other Rules may apply. 

If notice is required, see Rule 5(b) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for the ways 
notice of the subpoena can be served.  The party who requested the subpoena must arrange 
for service of the notice document. 

General information about Rule 5 service requirements can be found at the “District Court Civil” 
section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

Duties When Responding to a Subpoena 

A person who is served a subpoena has certain duties when they respond to the subpoena, 
depending on the contents of the subpoena. 

Review Rule 45(d) carefully to determine the duties that apply. 

The court may hold a person in contempt if they do not have an adequate excuse for disobeying 
the subpoena. 

Protections for a Person Responding to a Subpoena 

Rule 45(c) provides a number of protections to a person who was served a subpoena. 

The protections include: 

•  The party responsible for the subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing 

an undue burden or expense on the person subject to the subpoena. 
•  The person may ask the court to quash (stop) or modify the subpoena. 
•  When a subpoena requires production of documents, electronically stored information, 
or tangible things, or to permit inspection of premises, but does not also require the 
person to appear, the person is not required to appear at the deposition, hearing or 
trial. 

•  The person may object in writing to inspection, copying, testing, or sampling any or all of 
the commands in a subpoena for production of documents or tangible things, or to 
permit inspection of premises.

•  North Dakota residents may only be required to attend depositions in the county where 
the person resides, is employed or transacts business.  However, the court may order 
attendance at a convenient place. 

•  North Dakota residents may be required to attend a hearing or trial any place within 

North Dakota. 

The following informational guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

If parties in the civil action do not reach a settlement on all issues, the civil action will eventually 
go to trial. Issues on which the parties do not agree will be decided by a District Court Judge or 
a Judicial Referee. 

Caution! Preparing for trial is often a complex and confusing process. Self-represented 
individuals are held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if they 
don’t understand the rules or procedures.  Conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Public and

The Defendant arranges for service of service of copies of documents on the Plaintiff. 

For information about service after a civil action has been started, go to the “District Court 
Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

Finish Pre-Trial Preparations: 

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully! The North Dakota Rules of Evidence 
govern whether evidence is admitted at trial. The Rules also govern how parties object to 
evidence the other party wants to admit at trial. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. for the trial.  At minimum, prepare an outline of 
your remarks and arguments. 

re-Trial Conference 

The pre-trial conference in a civil action is a meeting of the judge and lawyers, or self-
represented parties, to review evidence and witnesses, to set a timetable, and to discuss the 
settlement of the case. 

See Rule 16 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for pre-trial conferences in civil 
matters. 

The purpose of a pre-trial conference includes the following: 

•  To expedite the final determination of the civil action; 
•  To establish early and continuing control so that the civil action will not be extended 

because of lack of management; 

•  To discourage wasteful pre-trial activities; 
•  To improve the quality of the trial through more thorough preparation; 
•  To facilitate settlement of the civil action; and 
•  To discuss the desirability of using alternative dispute resolution. 

In any civil action, the court may order the parties to appear for one or more pretrial 
conferences. 

However, there are certain triggering events which require a court to order a pretrial 
conference and issue a scheduling order.

Guide to Civil Action/Rev. Mar 2019 

The triggering events that require a court to order a pretrial conference are: 

•  More than six (6) months have passed since filing of the summons and complaint or 

answer without final disposition of the case or filing of a dispositive motion; 

•  The summons and complaint or answer was served more than six (6) months before 

filing and ninety (90) days have passed since filing without final disposition of the case 
or filing or a dispositive motion; 

•  A notice under Rule 40(e) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure has been issued 
and any response to the notice contained a request that the case be left open; or 

•  Any party makes a written request for a pretrial conference to enter a scheduling order.

  T

The trial is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the judge.  The trial is the final 
hearing in a contested civil action. 

The decision of the judge or jury in a civil action is called a judgment. 

Caution! A trial is often a complex and confusing process. Self-represented individuals are held 
to the same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if they don’t understand the 
rules or procedures.  Conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Public and 
academic libraries may have resources available. 

Conduct of the Trial 

The judge or judicial referee hears both sides and then issues a final judgment.  Sometimes, the 
final judgment is issued at the end of the trial.  Often, the final judgment is issued at a later 
date. 

In general, a trial proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement.  Usually, the Plaintiff goes first. 

•  Plaintiff Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Plaintiff presents their case first.  The Defendant may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the Plaintiff’s evidence. 

•  Defendant Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Defendant presents their case after the Plaintiff.  The Plaintiff may cross-

examine witnesses and object to the Defendant’s evidence.

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing argument. 

Proposed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment 

See Rule 52 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota Rules 
of Court. 

Findings of fact are the judge’s or judicial referee’s written determination of the facts made 
from the evidence presented.  This explains what facts the judge or judicial referee found to be 
true. 

Conclusions of law are the rulings of law made by the judge or judicial referee based on, or in 
connection with, the findings of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the judge or 
judicial referee found to be true. 

The judge or judicial referee may require one or more parties to prepare and file proposed 
findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order for judgment. 

The proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order for judgment must also be 
served on all parties, and proof of service filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

For information about service after a civil action has been started, go to the “District Court 
Civil” section on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website. 

The judge or judicial referee will decide whether the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order for judgment are appropriate.  If the judge or judicial referee decides they are 
appropriate, the judge or judicial referee will sign and date the findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order for judgment.  The findings of fact, conclusions of law and order for judgment are 
not official until signed and dated by the judge or judicial referee. 

Proposed Judgment 

Review Rule 54 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court. 

The judgment is the written order of the judge’s or judicial referee’s final decision. 

The judge or judicial referee may require one or more parties to prepare and file a proposed 
judgment.  The proposed judgment must also be served on all parties, and proof of service filed 
with the Clerk of District Court.

Statement of Costs and Disbursements 

See North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-26, Rule 54 and Rule 68 of the North Dakota Rules 
of Civil Procedure. 

A party awarded costs and disbursements must submit a detailed, verified statement of the 
costs and disbursements to the Clerk of Court. Upon receipt of the Order for Judgment granting 
costs and disbursements, the clerk will allow those costs and disbursements. 

If the party awarded costs and disbursements also prepares the judgment, the party inserts the 
costs and disbursements into the judgment. If the clerk prepares the judgment, the clerk inserts 
the costs and disbursements into the judgment. 

The following form is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help: 

•  Statement of Costs and Disbursements form 

Notice of Entry of Judgment 

See Rule 58 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Within 14 days after the judgment is entered, the prevailing parent must serve notice of entry 
of judgment on the other party or parties.  A copy of the judgment must be included with the 
notice of entry of judgment. 

After service is complete, the prevailing party must file the original, completed Notice of Entry 
of Judgment and proof of service on the other party or parties with the Clerk of District Court.

Verification 

Verification of a document is a sworn statement of the correctness, truth or authenticity of the 
document by the party submitting the document.   For example, a verified complaint has a 
notarized statement of the plaintiff that the complaint is true. 

In general, a pleading does not need to be verified.  See Rule 7 of the North Dakota Rules of 
Civil Procedure for a list of documents that are pleadings. 

If a rule or law specifically says a pleading or other document must be verified, verification is 
required. 

Pleadings that must be verified include, but are not limited to, the following: 

•  Petition for Adoption (See North Dakota Century Code Chapter 14-15) 
•  Petition for Foreign Adoption (See North Dakota Century Code Chapter 14-15) 
•  Petition for a Deposition Before the Civil Action is Filed (See Rule 27 of the North Dakota 

Rules of Civil Procedure) 

Notarization 

A notarized document has the signature of the party required to sign the document and the 
signature of the notary public who witnessed the signature.  A notarized document also has the 
official stamp of the notary public’s official notary seal.  For example, an affidavit is a notarized 
document. 

The following forms are available in the online Guide to a Civil Action: 

•  Caption and Signature form 
•  Caption and Signature (Petition) form 
•  Verification form 
•  Verification (Petition) form
