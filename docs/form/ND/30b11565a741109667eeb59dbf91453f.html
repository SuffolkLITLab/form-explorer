 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

the  census 

to  promote 

We’re  excited  to  announce  a  new  way  for  
to  your 
you 
community.  We  are  inviting  each  library  
in  the  state  to  create  a  video  about  the 
important  to  your 
it’s 
census  and  why 
specific  community.  NDSL  will  provide  a 
sample  script  that  you  can  personalize.  
We  will  also  edit  your  video  for  you.  We 
will  send  you  the  edited  version  for  use 
on  your  social  media. We’ll  also  share  it  on 
our  social  media  and  with  the  Complete  
Count  Committee  to  use.  If  you’d  like  to 
participate  or  have  any  questions,  please 
send an email to BreAnne at ndslpa@nd.gov. 

e  know  that  you  are  all  working  hard 
on  so  many  things,  and  we’d  like  to  thank 
you  in  advance  for  all  that  you’ve  done  to 
promote  the  census  so  far  and  all  you’ll  do  
I 
to  continue  to  promote  the  census. 
have  been  so  impressed  with  the  North 
Dakota 
library  community  always,  but 
especially these last few months. We are all 
in  this  together.  I  am  so  excited  to  see  the  
amazing videos that you’ll put together.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  affected  so 
much  of  our  lives  this  year,  including  the 
Census  2020  collection.  We  all  know  how 
important  the  census  is  to  our  state.  For  
each  person  that  doesn’t  fill  out  the  
census,  the  state  loses  about  $1,900  per 
year  for  each  of  the  10  years.  The  census 
completion  rate  is  just  over  61%  nationally 
as well as statewide. 

  W

ue  to  COVID-19,  the  self-response  phase 
is  now  through  October  31,  2020.  The  
in-person  follow  up  has  been  rescheduled 
to  August  11-October  31.  This  means  that 
enumerators  will  visit 
the  households 
in  person  that  haven’t  responded  to  the  
census questionnaire.

The  North  Dakota  Center  for  the  Book  and  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  would  like  to  
congratulate  the  winners  of  this  year’s  Letters  About  Literature  contest.  Students  in  grades  4

Breaking Into Online Storytime

Thinking  outside  the  box  is  the  mantra  for  many  libraries  as  they  work  to  bring  storytime  to  children  
this  summer.  Kathy  MacMillan,  an  MLS  librarian  and  nationally  certified  American  Sign  Language  
interpreter,  shared  tips  for  creating  outstanding  online  storytimes.  For  those  of  you  on-the-fence  
about  going  online,  continue  reading  as  we  bring  you  tips  and  tricks  to  make  your  online  experiences  
more successful.

MacMillan’s  first  tip  was  to  consider  the  fundamental  differences  between  online  and  in-person  
storytimes.  In  order  to  do  this,  she  recommends  that  you  devise  a  list  of  qualities,  objects,  and  goals  
that make up storytime. When thinking of goals, she offers this resource by Melissa Depper.

During  in-person  storytime,  you  can  see  and  hear  the  audience  in  real  time,  make  adjustments  as  you  
go,  and  control  the  environment.  Once  you  move  online,  your  mission  will  stay  the  same,  but  you  
can’t  always  see  your  audience,  give  immediate  feedback,  or  adjust  your  delivery  based  on  the  
audiences’  reactions.  You  also  can’t  control  the  environment  in  which  the  storytime  is  received.  All  of  
these  limitations  are  apt  to  make  you  feel  disconnected  from  your  audience,  especially  if  the  storytime  
is  not  done  in  real  time. What  is  missing  is  the  connection  you  develop  with  your  audience  when  they  
are in person.

MacMillan  suggests  that  you  develop  that  connection  in  the  online  environment  so  your  online  
storytime is better received. Here are some ideas:

Share a favorite rhyme or poem
Introduce your pet
Share a hobby

•  Record a message letting kids know you miss seeing them in the library
• 
• 
• 
•  Booktalk your favorite books
• 
•  Give a backyard tour to meet chickens, goats, etc. or show your flowers and garden

Share a craft

Always think of ways you can foster a sense of security and connection. Once that online connection is  
built, your storytime audience will grow.

As  you  plan  your  presentation,  remember  that  10-20  minutes  seems  to  be  the  ideal  time  limit.  
Consider these steps as you prepare:

Really think about the materials you want to use.
•  How will you make instructions clear?
•  What interactive elements, if any, will you use?
•  How will you show the materials on camera?

How will you promote and make connections to library resources?

•  At the very least, display your library’s logo in the background
•  Promote your library website
•  Mention and/or show specific resources where appropriate

Online  storytime  is  not  likely  to  go  away  anytime  soon.  As  you  ponder  your  comfort  level  with  online 
storytelling,  start  viewing  other  online  programs,  look  over  your  library’s  children’s  collection  for 
high-interest  stories  with  potential  for  voicings,  puppets,  or  other  props.  Network  with  your  fellow  
librarians, and stay-tuned for the next article in July on all the “technical stuff.”

Coming To A Library Near You: Beanstack

It’s  June,  and  that  means  public  libraries  everywhere  have  
begun  their  summer  reading  programs.  Your  public 
library 
is  probably  doing  their  program  a  little  differently  this  year,  
compared  with  previous  years.  Many  libraries  have  moved  to 
an  online  reading  log  due  to  concerns  over  the  COVID-19.  The  
State  Library  is  no  exception  to  this  and  has  subscribed  to  a  
new database called Beanstack.
  
Beanstack  lets  patrons  from  all  over  the  state  create  an  account  by  choosing  their  public  library.  A  
patron  can  create  an  adult  account  for  themselves  and  then  add  accounts  for  their  children  as  well  all  
under  the  same  username.  The  challenges  come  at  four  different  levels  for  the  different  types  of  
users. There  is  the  emerging  reader  challenge,  which  is  ages  0-5;  the  children  challenge,  which  is  ages 
6-13;  the  teen  challenge,  which  is  ages  14-17;  and  the  adult  challenge,  which  is  ages  18+. You  can  add  
as  many  teen  or  child  accounts  as  necessary  to  the  parent  account,  and  the  parent  account  can  enter  
the  reading  information.  Not  only  does  Beanstack  provide  a  reading  log,  but  it  also  comes  with  
non-reading badges that can be earned to complete the challenge. If you’d like to find out more about  
how  to  sign  up  for  Beanstack,  we  have  a  tutorial  available  on  our YouTube  channel  that  will  walk  you  
through every step.

If you have any questions, please contact us at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

I  say  that  the  book  I’m  looking  forward  to  the  
most  this  year  is  her  Joy  at  Work,  you  should 
probably  take  my  words  as  seriously  as  you  
would  take  any  fanatic.  That  being  said,  Kondo’s 
newest  book  about  decluttering  your  work  life 
in  order  to  clear  the  way  for  productivity  and

changing  throughout  their  life.  This  means  that  
it’s  possible  to  shape  your  personality  for  the

our personalities evolve.

human  by  enjoying  something  that  makes  me

best nonfiction titles.

5 Languages of Workplace Appreciation 
Presenter: Gail Santy, Central Kansas Library System
Thursday, June 18, 2020 1:30 PM-2:15 PM (CST)

Creating  a  work  environment  where  individuals  are  connecting  and  honoring  differences  is  critical  
to the success of any workplace team. This workshop provides valuable research and insight into how  
all  employees  need  to  understand  that  what  they  do  on  behalf  of  the  organization  matters.  We  
will  discuss  the  ways  individuals  best  receive  the  message  of  appreciation  that  differs  from  person 
to  person. The  overarching  goal  of  the  Appreciation  at Work  workshop  is  to  assist  individuals  in  the 
workplace  (both  employees  and  volunteers)  in  understanding  how  to  communicate  appreciation  
and  encouragement  effectively  to  their  colleagues  and  to  provide  the  resources  and  support  to  
apply this knowledge proactively in their current work environment.

divisive  public  conversations?  Are  our  emotional  responses  to  informational  content  distorting  our 
perceptions  of  reality?  Are  we  getting  smarter?  Dumber?  Or  do  these  questions  radically  oversimplify  
more  complex  problems?  In  this  edWebinar,  Michelle  Luhtala  will  present  a  case  for  the  critical

North Dakota Library Tidbits

•  Libraries  across  the  state  are  gradually  re-opening  after  closures  due  to  the  
COVID-19  pandemic.  Many  libraries  are  taking  a  phased  approach  by  first  offering  
curb-side  service  and  then  moving  towards  reopening  the  building  by  appointment  
and with social distancing practices in place. 

•  The  Lidgerwood  Library  is  creating  a  quilt  to  document  this  time  in  history.  Forty- 
eight  quilt  squares  were  handed  out  for  different  members  of  the  community  to  
decorate  with  markers,  paint,  and  needlework  as  a  part  of  this  memory  quilt;  it  will  
also  feature  the  names  of  the  high  school  seniors  that  had  their  final  year  of  high  
school  impacted  by  the  pandemic.  The  quilt  will  hang  on  the  wall  of  the  library  
once completed.

•  Summer  Reading  Programs  are  starting  up  for  many  public  libraries.  This  year,  
most  include  a  virtual  element  either  using  Facebook  Live  or  another  video- 
conferencing platform to introduce families to library services and programs. BeanStack 
is also being used across the state as a virtual reading log tracker.

•  Staff  of  the  Williston  Community  Library  came  together  to  decorate  the  sidewalk 
surrounding  their  building  with  chalk.  This  allowed  for  all  staff  members  to  practice  
social  distancing  guidelines  while  still  being  able  to  talk  and  socialize  and  spread  
goodwill throughout the community. 

•  Fargo  Public  Library  has  partnered  the  NDSU  Extension  Master  Gardener  Program  
to  help  encourage  gardening  and  donating  to  local  food  pantries.  The  library  had  
initially  planned  on  starting  a  seed  library  in  2020  and  acquired  the  seeds  over  the  
winter;  to  prevent  the  seeds  from  going  to  waste  during  the  library’s  closure,  they  
were  donated  to  the  NDSU  Extension  Master  Gardener  Program  to  help  food  
pantries across the state.

•  Several  libraries  have  measures  on  their  local  June  Primary  ballots  related  to  

their funding.

•  Morton  Mandan  Public  Library  is  holding  weekly  Fairy  Tale  Science  programs  on  
YouTube, which challenges patrons to solve a problem for a famous fairy tale charater.

•  Fargo Public Library is hosting a Fargo History Hunt program.

•  McKenzie  County  Public  Library  has  partnered  with  Watford  City  Recreation  to  hold  

Tot Time in different parks around Watford City.

•  Walhalla Public Library is displaying Story Walks next to the library.

Legal Research Resources for Affidavit to Transfer  
Personal Property of Deceased Person 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

JUNE 2020

   

Self-represented  patrons  of  the  North  Dakota 
Supreme  Court  Law  Library  and  North  Dakota  
Legal  Self  Help  Center  frequently  ask  how  to  
handle  a  deceased  person’s  estate  without  
bringing  a  probate  case  in  a  North  Dakota  state 
district court.

DEFINITIONS

Affidavit  for  Collection  of  Personal  Property 
of  Decedent  –  A  legal  document  that  transfers  
the personal property of a deceased person to the  
heir  or  successor  entitled  to  receive  the  property. 
The  entire  net  value  of  the  probate  property  of  
the  deceased  person’s  estate  must  be  $50,000  or  
less and can’t include any real property.

Estate  –  All  of  the  personal  and  real  property  a 
deceased  person  owned  or  had  an  interest  in  on  
the date of their death.

Personal  Property  –  All  property  that  isn’t  real 
property,  such  as  money,  stocks,  vehicles,  and 
furniture.

Real  Property  –  Land  and  things  attached  to  the 
land, such as buildings.

Probate  Property  –  The  property  in  a  deceased 
person’s  estate  that  doesn’t  automatically  transfer 
upon  their  death.  The  transfer  of  property 
is 
determined  by  the  deceased  person’s  will,  or  by 
intestate succession.

Heir  –  The  person  entitled  to  the  deceased  
person’s  property  according  to  the  deceased 
person’s  will,  or,  if  there  is  no  will,  by  North  
Dakota’s intestate succession laws.

Successor – See Heir. 

WHAT IS COLLECTION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY 
OF A DECEASED PERSON BY AFFIDAVIT?

When  a  person  dies,  most  of  the  work  to  be  
done  with  the  estate  is  the  legal  and  orderly  
transfer  of  the  deceased  person’s  property  to  
the  persons  entitled  to  receive  it  (the  creditors  
and heirs).

When  a  deceased  person  has  probate  property 
that  needs  to  be  transferred,  the  property  may  
be  transferred  by  an  affidavit  signed  by  the  heir(s) 
entitled  to  the  property,  if  the  probate  property 
meets  certain  requirements.  This  probate  process 
is  also  called  collection  of  personal  property  of  a 
deceased person by affidavit.

When  the  estate  meets  the  requirements  to  
transfer  personal  property  by  affidavit,  and  the 
holder  of  the  personal  property  accepts  the  
affidavit,  the  North  Dakota  state  court  system  isn’t 
involved in the process.

WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS?

An  heir,  either  by  will  or  intestate  succession,  
may  use  an  affidavit  to  transfer  probate  property  
if  the  heir  and  the  deceased  person’s  estate  meet  
the following requirements:

1.  At  least  30  days  have  passed  since  the  person 

died;

2.  The  total  net  value  of  the  probate  property  is 
$50,000  or  less  (total  value  minus  any  debts  or 
other encumbrances);

3.  No real property is part of the probate property;

4.  No  probate  case  is  started  or  completed  in  a 
North  Dakota  state  district  court,  a  court  of  
any other state, or a tribal court; and

5.  The  heir  claiming  the  personal  property  by 
affidavit  is  entitled  to  the  property  by  will  or 
intestate succession.

If the estate meets the requirements, the completed 
affidavit is presented to whoever holds the personal 
property for transfer to the heir entitled to receive it.

WHAT IF THE ESTATE DOESN’T MEET THE 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AFFIDAVIT?

If  the  deceased  person’s  estate  doesn’t  meet  the 
requirements  to  transfer  personal  property  by 
affidavit,  two  North  Dakota  state  district  court 
probate processes are available for appointment of 
a  personal  representative  to  handle  the  transfer  of 
probate property.

Informal  probate  cases  are  designed  to  allow  for 
limited  supervision  of  the  personal  representative 
by the North Dakota state district court. The district 
court  may  appoint  the  personal  representative 
without holding an in-person hearing.

Formal  probate  cases  are  designed  for  increased 
supervision  of  the  personal  representative  by 
the  North  Dakota  state  district  court.  In-person  
formal  
hearings  are  a  required  part  of  the 
probate process.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
