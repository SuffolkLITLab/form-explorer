A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide Your Motion 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows adult guardianship 
cases in District Court to be heard and decided by a judicial referee, rather than a District Court 
judge. 

If a judicial referee is assigned to the guardianship case, any party to the case may request that 
a District Court judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the guardianship case is heard and decided by a judicial referee, the judicial referee will issue 
findings of fact and an order.  The judicial referee’s findings of fact and order have the same 
effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court judge until superseded (replaced) by a 
written order of a District Court judge. 

If any party to the guardianship case wants a review of the judicial referee’s findings of fact and 
order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for the 
review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review. 

The party requesting the review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

More information about subpoenas is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/subpoenas. 

Evidence: You’re required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 12 of 14 

30.1-28-03.2 Objection/Rev May 2022 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask library staff of your local North 
Dakota library how to request the book. 

If the Hearing will be Held in Person, Attend the Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a set of forms is available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

If your hearing is in-person at the courthouse, arrive early so you don’t miss your hearing date 
and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to court on the date and time 
scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

If the Hearing will by Held by Zoom, Make Sure You Can Connect to the Zoom Hearing:

the hearing on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge, or judicial referee, hears both sides and then issues the findings of fact and order.

Before You Leave the Hearing:  

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Objecting Party goes first. 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP SEVEN: Findings of Fact and Order is Issued by the District Court 

Until the judge or judicial referee signs an order authorizing the sale of the Ward’s real 
property, the property can’t be sold. 

The judge or judicial referee will make a decision after the hearing and after reviewing the 
documents filed with the court.  The judge or judicial referee will then issue findings of fact and 
an order. 

You’ll receive a copy of the Findings of Fact and Order signed and dated by the judge or judicial 
referee by mail or email. 

The judge or judicial referee may order any of the following: 

•  Authorize the sale with the terms and conditions requested by the Guardian; 
•  Authorize the sale and add additional terms and conditions the Guardian must meet; OR 
•  Dismiss the motion entirely and not authorize the sale. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.
