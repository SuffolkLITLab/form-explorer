      <pre>Instructions for Motion for Order to Allow Payment of Room & Board 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms. 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if these forms and 
instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer.

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota state district court to allow payment of room and board in 
an existing guardianship of an adult.  There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept 
forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the forms or information provided. Use at your own risk.

[Page 1 of 6] 

Rev. May 2022 

Before Using These Forms 

Before deciding whether to ask a court to allow payment of room and board from the ward’s 
estate, you may wish to discuss any potential tax implications with a tax professional. 

You may also wish to discuss any implications for financial benefits, such as community services 
or Medicaid, with your local service providers. 

Purpose 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-28-12(7) relates to the requirement that funds from 
the ward’s estate can’t be used for room and board when room and board is being furnished by 
the Guardian, or the Guardian’s spouse, parent or child.  A court order is required to allow 
funds from the ward’s estate to be used for room and board in these instances.  These forms 
may be used to request the use of funds from the ward’s estate to pay for room and board. 

If a North Dakota state district court already ordered the use of funds from the ward’s estate to 
pay for room and board, these forms may be used to request an adjustment to the amount. 

If you’re the current Guardian representing yourself, you may complete and sign the forms.  If 
you’re unsure how to proceed or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation consult 
an attorney who can agree to represent you. 

If a separate conservator is appointed for the ward, don’t use these forms.  North Dakota 
Century Code Section 30.1-28-12(7) ONLY applies when a separate conservator hasn’t been 
appointed.

copy of the completed forms.  An Affidavit of Service is your proof. 

If you arrange to have copies of the completed forms hand delivered: 

•  The person who hand delivers the copies must be 18 years old or older, and can’t be a

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
