of Juvenile Procedure and appoint a lay guardian ad litem upon the approval of the 
petition.
An initial hearing must be set in accordance with rule 2 of the North Dakota Rules of 
Juvenile Procedure.
For   a   petition   filed   under   paragraphs 1,   2,   or 3   of   subdivision n   of   subsection 2   of

opposes the appointment of the proposed guardian shall file an objection to the 
appointment   and   a   demand   for   hearing   within   ten   days   of   the   service   of   the

excess   assets   and   determine   whether   a   conservatorship   is   necessary   under 
chapter 30.1-29.

may be inadequately represented, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the 
child.
At a proceeding commenced under this chapter, a parent who is indigent and unable 
to employ legal counsel is entitled to counsel at public expense. If a parent appears 
without counsel the court shall ascertain whether the parent knows the parent may be 
represented by counsel and that the parent is entitled to counsel at public expense if 
indigent.   The   court   may   continue   the   proceeding   to   enable   the   parent   to   obtain 
counsel and, subject to this section, counsel must be provided for an unrepresented 
indigent parent upon the parent's request and the court's determination that the parent 
is indigent.
An indigent parent is one who meets the definition of indigent under the guidelines 
adopted by the commission on legal counsel for indigents.

27-20.1-10. Conduct of hearings.
1.

A hearing under  this chapter must be conducted by the court without a jury,  in  an 
informal but orderly manner, and separately from other proceedings not included in 
section 27-20.2-03 or section 27-20.1-02.
The   proceedings   must   be   recorded   by   stenographic   notes   or   by   electronic, 
mechanical, or other appropriate means.
The petitioner shall present the evidence in support of any allegations of the petition 
not admitted.
The   general   public   must   be   excluded   from   the   hearing   and   only   the   parties,   their 
counsel, witnesses, victims, and any other persons the court finds to have an interest 
in the proceedings may be admitted. The court may temporarily exclude the child or 
other   person   from   the   hearing   if,   after   being   warned   by   the   court   that   disruptive 
conduct will cause removal from the courtroom, the child or other person persists in 
conduct justifying removal from the courtroom.

If the child has or will have significant excess assets, the court shall determine whether 
a conservatorship is necessary under chapter 30.1-29.

27-20.1-11. Appointment of guardian of a child.
1.

The court may appoint a guardian of a child if the court finds by clear and convincing 
evidence that the appointment is in the child's best interest and:
a.

Both parents are deceased or the surviving parent's rights have been terminated 
by a previous court order, but there has been no appointment of a guardian for 
the   child   by   will,   the   court   has   transferred   the   case   to   juvenile   court   without 
appointment   of   a   guardian,   or   the   testamentary   guardian   failed   to   accept   the 
appointment under chapter 30.1-27;
The parents have consented in writing by affidavit;
b.
All parental rights have been previously terminated; or

d.
The child is a child in need of protection as defined under section 27-20.1-01.
The   court   may  appoint   as   guardian   any   fit   and   willing   person   whose   appointment 
would be in the best interest of the child. If the court finds by clear and convincing 
evidence that the child is of sufficient maturity to make a sound judgment, or the child 
is age fourteen or older, the court may give substantial weight to the preference of the 
child. The court shall give due consideration to other factors that may have affected 
the   child's   preference,   including   whether   the   child's   preference   was   based   on 
undesirable or improper influences.
The court may appoint a guardian as a dispositional alternative if a child has been 
adjudicated   as   a   child   in   need   of   protection   or   delinquent   under   chapter   27-20.2, 
27-20.3, or 27-20.4.

have   been   met,   whether   the   guardian   is   a  fit   and   willing   person,   and   whether   the 
appointment of the guardian is in the child's best interest.

2. Upon finding that the requirements of section 27-20.1-06 have been met, the guardian

beginning inventory on the child if the child is fourteen years of age or older, and 
any interested persons designated by the court in its order.
The   date   on   which   the   first   annual   report   is   due   and   the   requirement   to   file

The   guardian   may  receive   money   payable   for   the   support   of   the   child   to   the 
child's parent, guardian, or custodian under the terms of any statutory benefit or 
insurance   system,   or   any   private   contract,   devise,   trust,   conservatorship,   or 
custodianship.
(1) The guardian may receive money or property of the child paid or delivered 
by virtue of section 30.1-26-03. Any sums received must be applied to the 
child's current needs for support, care, and education.

b.

(2) The guardian must exercise due care to conserve any excess sum for the 
child's future needs unless a conservator has been appointed for the estate 
of   the   child,   in   which   case   the   excess   sum   must   be   paid   over   at   least 
annually to the conservator. Sums so received by the guardian are not to be 
used for compensation for the guardian's services except as approved by 
order of the court or as determined by a duly appointed conservator other 
than the guardian.

(3) The guardian may not use funds from the child's estate for room and board 
that the guardian or the guardian's spouse have furnished to the child unless 
a charge for the service is approved by order of the court made upon notice 
to at least one of the child's next of kin, if notice is possible.

Page No. 6

(4) A  guardian   may  institute  proceedings  to  compel   the   performance  by  any 
person of a duty to support the child or to pay sums for the welfare of the 
child.

To facilitate the child's education, social, or other activities.
To authorize medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice. A guardian 
is not liable by reason of this consent for injury to the child resulting from the 
negligence or acts of third persons unless it would have been illegal for a parent 
to have consented.
A guardian shall file an annual report with the court regarding the exercise of 
powers and duties under this subsection.
(1) The report must describe the status or condition of the child, including any 
change of  residence  and  reasons  for   the  change,  any medical  treatment 
received by or withheld from the child, the child's educational progress, any 
expenditure   and   income   affecting   the   child,   and   any   exercise   of   legal 
authority by the guardian affecting the child.

(2) The   report   must   include   changes   that   have   occurred   since   the   previous 

reporting period and an accounting of the child's estate.

(3) The   guardian   shall   report   whether   the   child   continues   to   require   a 

guardianship.

(4) The report must be filed with the court.
(5) The filing of the report does not constitute an adjudication or a determination 
of the merits of the report nor does the filing of the report constitute the 
court's approval of the report.

(6) The court shall review the report and a hearing may be set.
(7) The office of the state court administrator shall provide forms that may be 
used   to   fulfill   reporting   requirements.   Any   report   must   be   similar   in 
substance to the state court administrator's form.

(9)

(8) Copies of the guardian's annual report and of any other reports required by 
the court must be mailed to the child, if the child is age fourteen or older, the 
child's   parents,   unless   the   parents'   rights   have   been   terminated   or   the 
parents are deceased, and any interested persons designated by the court 
in its order.
If   a   guardian   fails   to   file   a   complete   annual   report   as   required   by   this 
subdivision, fails to file a report at other times as the court may direct, or 
fails to provide an accounting of an estate, the court, upon its own motion or 
upon petition of any interested person, may issue an order compelling the 
guardian to show cause why the guardian should not immediately make and 
file the report or account, or be found in contempt for failure to comply. A 
copy of the order to show cause must be provided to the child, if the child is 
age fourteen or older, the child's parents, unless the parents' rights have 
been   terminated   or   the   parents   are   deceased,   any   interested   persons 
designated by the court in its order, and the juvenile court director.

The guardian shall inform the court of any change in the child's residence within 
thirty   days   of   the   change,   but   must   seek   prior   authorization   of   the   court   to 
establish or move the child's residence outside of the state.
In determining what is in  the  child's best interest, the guardian shall take into 
account   the   child's   preferences   to   the   extent   actually   known   or   reasonably 
ascertainable by the guardian.
To the extent reasonable, the guardian shall delegate to the child responsibilities 
for decisions affecting the child's well-being.
The guardian may not delegate authority as a guardian under a power of attorney 
without prior approval from the court.

the guardianship is no longer necessary. Resignation of a guardian does not terminate 
the guardianship unless specifically ordered by the court.
Any party to the proceeding in which the child's status was adjudicated, the director, 
the child, if fourteen or more years of age, or any interested person, may petition for 
removal   or   modification   of   a   guardian   on   the   grounds   the   removal   or   modification 
would be in the best interest of the child. A petition for removal or modification must 
include a request for appointment of a successor guardian unless continuation of the 
guardianship is no longer necessary.
Any party to the proceeding in which the child's status was adjudicated, the director,

termination of the guardianship due to:
a.
b.
c.
The   person   seeking   modification,   resignation,   removal,   or   termination   of   the 
guardianship shall file a supporting affidavit with the petition demonstrating the basis 
for the petition, and serve the petition and affidavit on the child, if the child is age 
fourteen or older, the child's parents, unless the parents' rights have been terminated 
or the parents are deceased, and any interested persons designated by the court in its 
order.  The   petition   must   be   reviewed   by  the   court   to  determine   whether   to  set   an 
evidentiary hearing. If an insufficient showing has been made, the court shall issue an 
order denying the petition.
If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines it is in the best interest of the 
child, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem.
If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines the interests of the child are or 
may be inadequately represented, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the 
child.

27-20.1-17. Expiration and termination of guardianship of a child.
1.

An order appointing or reappointing a guardian under this chapter is effective for up to 
one year unless the court, upon a finding of good cause, sets a different time frame. 
An order may not be effective for more than three years. At least sixty days before the 
expiration of the initial order of appointment or any following order of reappointment, 
the court shall request and consider information submitted by the guardian, the child, if 
fourteen years of age or older, the child's attorney, if any, the child's parents, and any 
interested persons regarding whether the need for a guardianship continues to exist. 
The court, at its discretion, may appoint a guardian ad litem in accordance with section 
27-20.1-08,   before   the   hearing.   The   court   shall   hold   a   hearing   on   whether   the 
guardianship should continue. Following the hearing and consideration of submitted 
information, the court may:
a.

Terminate the guardianship if shown by clear and convincing evidence that the 
circumstances that led to the guardianship no longer exist;

Appoint a new guardian.

b. Reappoint the guardian for up to three years; or
c.
A  guardian's  authority  and  responsibility terminates upon  the  death,   resignation,   or 
removal of the guardian, or upon the child's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of 
majority,  but termination does not  affect the guardian's  liability for prior  acts or  the 
guardian's obligation to account for funds and assets of the child. For cases arising 
under section 27-20.3-16, the age of majority is age twenty-one.
The   supreme   court,   by   rule   or   order,   shall   provide   for   the   regular   review   of 
guardianships in existence on August 1, 2019.

27-20.1-18. Appointment of emergency guardian of a child.
1. Upon petition by a person interested in the child's welfare, the court may appoint an 
emergency   guardian   if   the   court   finds   that   compliance   with   the   procedures   of   this 
chapter will likely result in substantial harm to the child's health, safety, or welfare. 

Page No. 8

2.

Immediately upon receipt of the petition for an emergency guardian, the court shall 
appoint a guardian ad litem to advocate for the best interests of the child.
An emergency guardian may be appointed without hearing or notice to the child, the 
child's parent or legal custodian, or the child's guardian ad litem only if the court finds 
from   affidavit   or   other   sworn   testimony   that   the   child   will   be   substantially   harmed 
before a hearing can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian without 
hearing   or   notice   to   the   child,   the   child's   parent   or   legal   custodian,   or   the   child's 
guardian   ad   litem,   the   child,   the   child's   parent   or   legal   custodian,   and   the   child's 
guardian ad litem must be given notice of the emergency appointment by the petitioner 
within   forty-eight   hours   after   the   emergency   appointment.   The   court   shall   hold   a 
hearing on the appropriateness of the emergency appointment within ninety-six hours 
after the emergency appointment or filing of the petition.

4.

3. Reasonable notice, either oral or written, stating the time, place, and purpose of the 
hearing must be given to the child, if fourteen years of age or older, and, to the child's 
parents or legal custodian, if they can be found. If oral notice is provided, the petitioner 
must file an affidavit stating that oral notice including the time, place, and purpose of 
the hearing has been provided.
The   court   shall   determine   if   there   is   probable   cause   to   believe   the   emergency 
appointment   is   in   the   best   interest   of   the   child   and   one   of   the   provisions   of 
subsection 1 of section 27-20.1-11 is met.
If   the   emergency   guardian   is   found   to   be   appropriate,   the   court   may   order   the 
emergency guardian remain in place for no more than sixty days from the date of the 
hearing. The court may extend the emergency order for up to six months.
A request for an emergency guardian may be included in a petition for appointment of 
a guardian of a child under section 27-20.1-05.

5.

27-20.1-19. Attorney's fees.
If   the   court   determines   an   action   brought   under   section   30.1-27-07   or   this   chapter   is 
frivolous,  the  court may award reasonable, actual, and statutory costs, including reasonable 
attorney's fees, incurred by or on behalf of the child.

27-20.1-20. Protective order.
1.

At any stage of the proceedings, upon application of a party or on the court's own 
motion, the court may make an order restraining or otherwise controlling the conduct 
of an individual if the court finds the conduct:
a.
b. Will tend to defeat the execution of an order of disposition; and

Is or may be detrimental or harmful to the child; or

2. Due notice of the application or motion and the grounds therefor and an opportunity to 

be heard have been given to the person against whom the order is directed.

27-20.1-21. Orders for evaluation.
1.

The   court   may   order   a   party   or   a   proposed   guardian   to   submit   to   a   chemical 
dependency, parental capacity, mental health, domestic violence, anger management, 
or other relevant evaluation by a suitably licensed or certified examiner. The court may 
request   other   persons   having   regular   contact   with   the   child   submit   to   a   chemical 
dependency, parental capacity, mental health, domestic violence, anger management, 
or   other   relevant   evaluation  by  a  suitably  licensed  or   certified   examiner.   Failure  to 
submit to an evaluation will be taken into consideration by the court.
The order may be made only on motion for good cause by a party or guardian ad 
litem, or on the court's own motion, and on notice to all parties and the person to be 
evaluated. The order must:
a.

Specify the type of evaluation and the type of professional or entity to perform the 
evaluation;
Include the deadline for performing the evaluation;
Include the date by which the evaluation must be filed with the court; and

b.
c.

2.

Page No. 9

3.

4.

d.

Specify the party that must pay the costs of the evaluation. If the party is unable 
to pay the costs, the court may direct the costs to be paid, in whole, or in part, by 
the county. The court may direct the party to reimburse the county, in whole or in 
part, for the payment.

The  evaluation  must be in writing and must set out in detail the evaluator's findings, 
including diagnoses, conclusions, and the results of any tests. The evaluator must file 
a copy with the court.
The evaluation reports and any addendums are confidential. The public or the parties 
may not read or copy the evaluation reports or addendums unless the court, in its 
discretion, gives permission. The guardian ad litem may read the evaluation reports 
and addendums but may not copy the evaluation reports and addendums unless the 
court, in its discretion, gives permission. A party, proposed guardian, or other person 
requested to submit to an evaluation by the court under this section is entitled to a 
copy of the report of evaluation and any addendum, upon request.

27-20.1-22. Confidentiality.
Except   as   provided   by   section   27-20.2-21,   all   files   and   records   under   this   chapter   are 

closed to the public and confidential.
