A MESSAGE FROM ARSL  
Submitted by Lisa Lewis, ARSL President

I  went 

As 
to  bed  on  election  night 
contemplating  the  results  of  the  midterms, 
it  occurred  to  me  that  the  American  people 
presented  our  Representatives  and  Senators 
a  wonderful  opportunity.  The  opportunity  to 
put  into  action  some  very  important  things 
that  those  of  us  who  work  in  the  library  field  
do every single day! Collaboration, partnerships, 
information, 
compromise, 
research,  teamwork,  hard  work,  and  putting 
aside our personal feelings to do what is best for 
our communities! 

respect, 

factual 

They  can  take  our  example  in  how  we  treat 
those  who  we  serve.  When  you  come  into 
my  library,  I  don’t  see  your  color,  your  race, 
your  nationality,  your  gender,  your  religious 
beliefs  or  your  political  party.  I  see  a  person!! 
I  see  someone  who  needs  my  assistance  in 
a  multitude  of  different  ways  and  I  promise 
that I will serve that person to the very best of  
my ability! 

So  come  on  Democrats  and  Republicans!  Put 
aside your differences and remember who you 
are  there  to  serve!  Learn  from  us  Librarians 
because if you do what we do every single day, 
you can’t go wrong!

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

It’s  November,  so  it’s  time  to  focus  on  gratitude  
and  being  thankful  for  all  the  gifts  that  I  have.  
I  work  hard  to  express  my  gratitude  throughout 
the  year,  but  during  November, 
I  actively 
think  about  something  I’m  thankful  for  each 
day.  I  post  something  daily  on  Facebook  for 
#ThankfulNovember.  I’ve  been  doing  this  for  a 
number of years now and have quite a few friends 
that  join  in  also.  I  am  super  blessed  and  really 
enjoy  the  focus  on  remembering  that  during 
November.  Here  are  a  few  library  related  things 
that I’m thankful for. 

I  am  thankful  for  the  gift  of  books  and  reading.  I 
have  always  been  a  reader.  I  come  from  a  family 
of  readers.  I  have  many  fond  memories  of  hours 
spent  sitting  in  the  crook  of  the  willow  tree  in  
our  backyard  with  my  best  friend,  both  of  us 
reading.  I  miss  that  willow  tree  and  those  simple 
moments of joy, but I’m incredibly grateful to have 
the memory of them. 

I  am  thankful  for  being  a  librarian.  I  believe  that 
librarianship  is  a  vocation,  and  I’m  truly  thankful 
that  it  is  mine.  I  love  everything  about  being  a 
librarian. I have had the opportunity to serve in a 
number  of  different  capacities  during  my  library 
career,  and  I  am  grateful  for  all  the  experiences 
that I’ve had. 

I  am  thankful  to  be  the  State  Librarian  of  North 
Dakota. This is my favorite library gig so far. I love 
being able to help libraries of all types and sizes. 
I  enjoy  advocating  for  libraries  in  many  different 
arenas — at the local, regional and national levels. 
I am grateful for my state library colleagues across 
the nation that I’ve been blessed to work with. 

I  am  grateful  for  my  library  peeps.  I  have  met 
librarians  from  many  walks  of  life,  and  I  have 
learned  from  all  of  them.  Many  that  have  started 
as  colleagues  have  become  friends.  I  love  how 
helpful  librarians  are  and  that  service  is  at  the 
heart  of  what  we  do.  I  am  thankful  for  all  of  the 
help that I’ve received in my library journey. 

I  am  grateful  for  the  librarians  in  North  Dakota.  I 
am honored to be able to represent North Dakota 
libraries in a variety of settings and opportunities. 
The  librarians  in  North  Dakota  truly  exhibit  the 
epitome of librarianship that I treasure. 

I am thankful for our Librarian for a Day program 
that  brings  me  into  libraries  across  the  state.  I’m 
also  thankful  for  those  libraries  that  have  invited 
me  to  their  library  for  whatever  reason  but 
especially as part of our program. It is so great to  
be  able  to  talk  about  the  successes  of  and 
challenges  faced  by  our  North  Dakota  libraries 
from firsthand experience. 

I am thankful for Superintendent Baesler, Assistant 
Superintendents  Bob  Christman  and  Laurie 
Matzke  and  the  whole  DPI  team. We  continue  to 
increase  our  collaboration  and  partnerships  with 
DPI  and  that  benefits  North  Dakota.  I  appreciate 
Superintendent  Baesler’s  understanding  of 
librarianship and always welcome an opportunity 
to provide for her to spend time with her people as 
she refers to librarians. 

I  would  like  to  conclude  by  thanking  my  North 
Dakota  State  Library  colleagues  for  the  honor  of 
serving our wonderful state alongside them. I am 
blessed beyond measure by those colleagues and 
they  make  it  easy  for  me  to  serve  you.  My  final 
thank you is to our library colleagues, patrons and 
the  citizens  of  North  Dakota  for  allowing  us  to 
serve them. 

There  are  so  very  many  things  to  be  thankful 
for.  Sometimes  in  this  crazy,  hectic,  busy  world 
we  forget  that.  I  invited  you  to  join  me  in 
#ThankfulNovember on social media, in a journal, 
or  whatever  method  works  for  you.  I  encourage 
you  to  invite  your  community  to  participate  by 
providing a means for them to share their moments 
of gratitude on a Facebook page, bulletin board or 
a notebook at the circ desk. Drop me a line or tag 
me  on  social  media  to  let  me  know  what  you’re 
grateful for.

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

Points of View Reference Center

Points  of  View  Reference  Center  is  a  database  that  gives  a  neutral,  pro,  and  con 
viewpoint for specific topics. This database is great for students who wish to know 
more  about  hot  topics  in  our  society  or  ones  who  are  preparing  for  a  debate. The 
database will provide an overview of the topic, which is the neutral, and then it will 
give a point and counterpoint to it. Additionally, it will provide a critical analysis guide 
to the topic. 

Not every topic in the database will have everything mentioned, but all of the ones 
that have been in the news recently will have every feature available to them. Some 
features that are in every part of the database are the options to add it to a folder, print 
the  topic,  email  a  link,  cite  the  information  in  several  different  bibliographic  styles, 
and create notes to attach virtually to different parts of the article. Each topic has a 
bibliography section as well, which will help the student with further research into 
this topic in order to write a paper or give a speech. With all of these different options, 
the database is perfect for student research into the tough topics of today. 

If you have any questions on this database or others that we offer please email us at 
ndsltrain@nd.gov.

NEW STEM KITS AVAILABLE

BE A NASA DETECTIVE: EXPANDING YOUR SENSES

The	 NASA@	 My	 Library	 Kit	 #2	 is	 now	 available	 to	 be	 reserved	 through	 KitKeeper!  This  kit  is  full  of  
activities  that  will  provide  space  science  programming  for  your  patrons.  Kit  2  assists  library  staff  in  
facilitating  programs  around  exciting  NASA  science  mission  topics  and  focuses  on  activities  and  
experiences	 that	 help	 patrons	 (and	 library	 staff!)	 be	 more	 comfortable	 using	 tools	 of	 science	 and	 
making  predictions  based  on  their  observations.  This  kit  focuses  on  things  we  cannot  see  with  our  
normal vision or sense with our normal senses. 

EVO OZOBOT

Evo is an award-winning pocket-sized coding robot great for people over  
8  years  old.  There  are  a  number  of  different  ways  you  can  code  Evo;  
the most basic coding that you can do is by drawing lines on paper and 
having the optical sensor detect what color the ink is. Depending on the 
color  of  ink,  Evo  will  do  different  things.  Another  way  you  can  code  Evo  
is  through  a  programming  system  that  will  let  you  code  actions  directly 
into  the  robot  using  your  web  browser.  There  are  some  codes  installed  
on the app to begin with, such as dancing and walking a catwalk.

This kit is now available to be reserved through KitKeeper and will definitely 
be a huge hit for small kids because of the blinking lights and tricks that 
Evo can complete. 

KEVA PLANKS

No matter the skill level, everyone can enjoy building with KEVA planks. Each plank is perfectly cut and 
identical, making structures surprisingly stable. No glue, no connectors. This kit, which is now available  
to be reserved on KitKeeper, includes 400 planks and a quick start guide that includes ideas on what you 
can build. Recommended for people ages 5 and up.

ROBOT WARS: CODING STRATEGY GAME

Coding  is  a  fundamental  skill  that  helps  kids  improve  logical 
thinking,  creativity,  and  cognitive  skills.  Robot Wars  is  a  fun-filled 
coding  game  that  can  be  enjoyed  by  2-4  players  ages  7  and  up 
with no prior coding skills. It introduces players to how a computer 
executes  the  code  through  sequential  logic,  using  Java  code 
blended into English commands.

Players  will  develop  skills  in  sequential  logic,  conditional  logic,  
if-else syntax, while loop syntax, for loop syntax, functions, bugs, 
and robotic movements.

The goal of this game is simple: test your skills of instructing robots 
through  a  war  using  the  cards  given.  The  first  one  to  reach  the 
middle grid of the board wins. Reserve a kit today on KitKeeper!

This STEM initiative was made possible by the collaboration of the Air Force STEM Program and Grand Forks  
AFB, School Liaison Office. The mission of the Air Force K-12 STEM program is to inspire and develop student  
interest  in  Department  of  Defense  STEM  education  and  careers.  The  Air  Force  provides  numerous  K-12  STEM 
outreach  opportunities  to  K-12  students  both  on  Air  Force  bases  and  in  the  local  communities.  For  more 
information on AF STEM programs, visit www.afstem.org or Facebook at AirForceSTEM. 

NASA@  My  Library  is  a  project  of  The  National  Center  for  Interactive  Learning  at  the  Space  Science  Institute, 
in partnership with the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies, American Library Association Public Programs 
Office,  the  Pacific  Science  Center,  Cornerstones  of  Science,  and  Education  Development  Center.  The  four  
state library project partners are: Washington State Library, North Dakota State Library, the Library of Michigan, 
and South Carolina State Library.

STEM KITS AND MAILING 

Wow, have these STEM kits been popular! We have over fifty kits available for schools and libraries 
to check out and use for STEM educational programs. The North Dakota State Library Circulation 
Department  hardly  has  time  to  even  shelve  them;  we  just  turn  them  around  and  send  them  
back out! It’s not uncommon to have every STEM kit either checked out, in the mail going out,  
or to be waiting for one to arrive back to the State Library. 

With the high demand for these kits, we want to remind libraries that it is vitally important to 
mail them back by the due date. Earlier than the due date is very much appreciated, especially 
if the due date falls before the weekend or a holiday. We have to manually check each kit and 
sometimes count each piece and part. By getting them back to us on time, or even earlier, we  
can keep them circulating onwards to the next library without any delay in the process. 

If  you  have  questions  about  mailing  your  kits  or  reserving  them,  contact  our  Circulation 
Department at 701-328-4657.

ADVOCACY TIP
State Librarian Mary Soucie

As the state coordinator for National Library Legislative Day, I have had an opportunity to participate in 
several	webinars	from	the	Congressional	Management	Foundation	(CMF),	sponsored	by	the	American	Library	
Association. CMF surveys congressional staffers and then share what they learn from the survey responses.  
I received the tip below from a staff member at ALA and thought it was pertinent to share. 

Here’s a tip from the Congressional Management Foundation for those of you interested in inviting 
members  of  Congress  to  visit  your  libraries  in  the  coming  months!  This  information  comes  from 
a recent survey of congressional staffers by CMF. They asked: “For each of the following activities 
(site visits), how many weeks in advance should the request be made for the Member to personally 
participate?”  Based  on  the  staffers  responses,  they  learned  that  advocates  should  submit  their 
requests for site visits (aka a visit to your library or other location or event) between 3-6 weeks prior 
to the event or date you’d like to host a visit. 

his  tip  is  for  federal  legislators,  but  I  think  the  same  idea  should  be  applied  to  local  officials  as  well  as 
state legislators. You can’t always control the timeline, but in general, the more notice you give an elected  
official, the greater the likelihood that s/he will be able to accept your invitation. I encourage you to invite 
your local, state, and Federal legislators to events at your library. It is a great opportunity for you to introduce 
your library’s successes. Invite the local press to attend. You can invite them to read a book at storytime, 
participate in a special program, or to recognize a “library celebration” such as National Library Week or 
Library Card Sign-up month. 

  T

When I was the Library Director at Wilmington Public Library District in Illinois, we worked with the city 
administrator  to  get  a  declaration  recognizing  September  as  National  Library  Card  Sign-up  month  by 
the  Mayor.  We  invited  the  Mayor  as  well  as  our  state  Senator  and  Representative  to  the  library  where  
we  presented  them  with  an  oversized  library  card.  The  press  came  and  took  pictures  and  got  quotes  
from each of the legislators and the Mayor on the importance of libraries in general — and our library in 
particular — at meeting the needs of the community. We then created a READ poster for each of them that  
we presented to them. When we visited the Representative at the Capitol for Library Legislative Day, the 
poster was proudly displayed on her wall. It was a great way to showcase the library for very little output. 

This is just one example of taking advantage of an opportunity to invite local officials and legislators to  
the library. If you need help thinking of additional opportunities, send me an email or give me a call. 

Another  opportunity  to  connect  with  legislators  will  be  presented  during  the  upcoming  Legislative  
Session. NDLA will once again be sponsoring a “Day at the Capitol” event on April 1st and will be looking 
for volunteers to assist with working the booth. This event will coincide with the State Library’s Renewal & 
Development event so you’ll have an opportunity to participate in the NDLA event when you attend R&D. 
Your time spent in Bismarck could be quite impactful for you and the library community.

Program Spotlight!: Noisy Art
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Get creative with your craft activities! Noisy art programs allow kids to be messy with their art making 
while making music at the same time. Attach different sizes of bells to your paint brushes or dunk an 
egg shaker in some paint and allow children to roll it around on their page. You can turn anything into 
a drum stick and let them splatter paint across their page to the beat of the music. Let your imagination 
run wild and allow any musical instrument to be a conduit for art.

NOVEMBER 2018

By Jessica Robinson

Maybe it’s all the extra energy from Halloween candy, 
but  something  about  November  puts  me  in  the  
mood  to  solve  a  mystery. Thankfully,  I  can  do  that 
without  leaving  the  comfort  of  my  cozy  chair  by  
reading  some  of  the  best  mysteries  2018  has  to 
offer.  First,  we’ll  take  a  look  at  exciting  entries  in  a  
few  mystery  series,  and  then  we’ll  finish  up  with  
some standalones.

Jude  Deveraux  is  known  for  her  romance  fiction, 
but  she  made  her  mystery  debut  this  year  with  A 
Willing  Murder,  featuring  a  retired  romance  author, 
a  crumbling  old  mansion,  and  a  couple  of  surprise 
skeletons. The Amish and murder shouldn’t be such 
a  perfect  mix,  but  in  Linda  Castillo’s  A  Gathering  
of Secrets, Police Chief Kate Burkholder finds more 
than a few dark secrets when investigating arson in 
a  quiet Amish  community.  In  The  Day  of  the  Dead, 
Nicci French’s psychologist protagonist Frieda Klein 
returns for the last time to grapple with her longtime 
nemesis  —  a  killer  who’s  skilled  at  impersonation 
and  obsessed  with  her. A  lonely  Scottish  island  full 
of POWs during World War II is the setting of Susan 
Elia MacNeal’s The Prisoner in the Castle, where lead 
character  Maggie  Hope  has  to  figure  out  who’s 
killing  all  of  her  fellow  spies. A  plane  crash  and  a  
dead politician are the focus of William Kent Krueger’s 
Desolation  Mountain,  which  unites  Cork  O’Connor 
and  his  son  Stephen  in  order  to  solve  whether 
it  was  a  malfunction  or  something  more  sinister. 
Craig Johnson’s stoic cowboy-sheriff Walt Longmire  
returns  in  Depth  of  Winter  to  face  his  greatest 
nightmare  when  a  drug  cartel  kidnaps  his  daughter 
and  threatens  to  auction  her  off  to  his  many 
enemies.  On  the  cozier  side  of  mystery,  Kate 
Carlisle  combines  rare  books,  a  bridal  shower,  
and murder in Buried in Books, the fourteenth entry 
in  her  Bibliophile  series.  Finally,  we  end  Weeping  
Waters, 
in  Karin  
Brynard’s  Albertus  Beeslaar  series,  which  takes  a 
Johannesburg detective  to  a  rural  outpost near the 
Kalahari Desert.

translated  book 

the  first 

In Stuart Turton’s The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, 
Aiden Bishop is trapped in cycle of waking up on the 
same  day  in  different  bodies,  forced  to  watch  the 
same murder over and over until he can identify the 
killer. NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar teamed up 
with Anna Waterhouse to write Mycroft and Sherlock, 
a story about the famous detective and his politician 
brother  in  their  younger  days  as  they  attempt  to 
solve  a  mystery  concerning  the  opium  trade.  First 
love  and  female  friendship  provide  the  backdrop 
for  Jennifer  Hillier’s  Jar  of  Hearts,  when  Detective 
Kaiser Brody discovers that her childhood friend was 
murdered by their best friend Georgina’s volatile first  
boyfriend, now an infamous serial killer. Christopher 
Huang’s A Gentleman’s Murder pairs the shadow cast 
by World War  I  with  the  secret  society  formed  in 
an  exclusive  gentleman’s  club  in  London,  forcing  its 
newest  member  to  choose  between  his  loyalties 
to  the  law  and  his  desire  to  follow  in  his  family’s  
footsteps.  Clare  Mackintosh’s  Let  Me  Lie  follows  a  
young  mother  as  she  attempts  to  investigate  the 
mysterious  circumstances  surrounding  her  parents’ 
supposed  suicides.  Tana  French’s  Dublin  Murder 
Squad is a favorite series of mine, but her standalone 
The Witch Elm promises to be a thrilling ride as well 
when  a  man  returns  to  his  family’s  ancestral  home 
to  recover  from  a  savage  attack,  only  to  become 
embroiled  in  deadly  family  secrets  when  a  skull 
is  found  in  a  trunk  under  their  elm  tree.  Walter 
Mosley got attention in the 90s when President Bill 
Clinton  named  him  as  his  favorite  author,  and  he’s 
still  going  strong  with  Down  the  River  Unto  the  Sea,  
the  complicated  story  of  a  disgraced  NYPD 
investigator-turned-private-detective  who  has  to 
solve  the  mystery  of  who  framed  him  and  why. 
Finally, K.A. Tucker’s Keep Her Safe is the story of the 
children  of  two  police  officers  who  come  together 
to investigate the secrets and scandals that destroyed 
their families. 

It’s hard to believe it, but 2018 is winding to a close. 
Next  month,  we’ll  look  at  the  award-winning  hits 
of  the  year,  just  in  time  to  finish  our  reading  goals  
before 2019.

NDLCC CORNER

The	North	Dakota	Library	Coordinating	Council	(NDLCC)	met	in	Bismarck	at	the	State	Library	and	via	Zoom	
on October 11. The main item on the agenda was to discuss and award the Library Vision grant. The Council 
awarded 31 grants totaling $76,006. 

The NDLCC also discussed future grant rounds. There will be a non-competitive grant round announced 
in January that will have a quick turnaround time. The Council also plans to have a partnership grant in 
the beginning of the next biennium. The purpose of the grant will be to encourage libraries to create new 
partnerships within their community that will assist the library in increasing the capacity to serve and will 
result in long lasting partnerships. 

The NDLCC discussed revisions to the Standards for Public Libraries and provided some guidance for State 
Library staff. A committee has been formed and work will begin very soon on revising the standards. Once 
a draft has been approved by the Council, we will announce a comment period and hope that libraries will 
share their thoughts and concerns with us on the proposed changes. 

Questions about the NDLCC can be addressed to State Librarian Mary Soucie.

READING IS HEALTHY: INTRODUCING THE NNLM READING CLUB
 Submitted by Darlene Kaskie,  
Community Engagement Coordinator for the National Network of Libraries of Medicine

Book  Clubs  or  reading  groups  are  a  staple  of  library  outreach  and  literacy  efforts.  People  gather  
to  discuss  Oprah’s  picks  or  the  New  York  Times’  Best  Sellers  to  socially  engage  with  literature  and  
current events.

o help grow health literacy, the NNLM All of  Us  Community Engagement  Network  announced  the 
launch of the NNLM Reading Club. The goal is to support libraries’ health literacy efforts and address 
local communities’ health information needs by celebrating important National Health Observances 
through the fun and intimacy of a book club.

he NNLM Reading Club offers a selection of three different book titles along with corresponding free, 
ready-to-use  materials  designed  to  help  promote  and  facilitate  a  book  club  discussion  on  a  health 
issue or topic. It’s easy to download the discussion materials and direct patrons to the library’s book 
holdings. However, the NNLM is offering an added benefit.

eginning November 1st, participating NNLM libraries are making the quarterly Reading Club picks 
available  in  a  free,  handy,  portable  Book  Club  Kit.  This  program-in-a-box  format  includes  8  copies  
of  each  of  the  following  items:  the  selected  book,  discussion  guide,  MedlinePlus.gov  flyer,  NIH 
MedlinePlus Magazine, NIH All of Us Research Program brochure and additional material in support  
of  the  health  topic  all  of  which  are  tucked  inside  a  handy  library  book  bag  and  shipped  to  the  
requesting library. 

ny U.S. library that is an organizational member of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine is 
eligible to apply and to receive one NNLM Reading Club Book Kit from November 1, 2018 through April 
30, 2019. Due to the limited supply of federally-sponsored NNLM Reading Club Book Kits, libraries that 
support outreach to vulnerable populations receive priority status.

SCAMS USING GIFT CARDS
Submitted by Carol Kando-Pimeda, Federal Trade Commission

The Federal Trade Commission published some new and important information for your patrons to know 
about scams using gift cards.

Gift cards are a great way to give a gift. But, now they are also a scammer’s favorite way to steal money. 
According to the FTC’s new Data Spotlight, more scammers are demanding payment with a gift card than 
ever before – a whopping 270 percent increase since 2015. Gift cards are for gifts, not for payments. If 
someone calls asking you to pay them by buying a gift card, it’s always a scam.

The Federal Trade Commission just published the contact information of the top gift card and reloadable 
card  issuers.  Consumers  can  now  report  scams  using  a  gift  card  directly  to  them.  You  can  access  this 
information by visiting their blog, which includes a new video that can be placed on your website and used 
on social media. 

Finally, we also are happy to provide 15-20 minute “just the basics” train-the-trainer webinars and conference 
calls for public librarians – on this or other consumer, scam prevention, and money management issues. I 
manage our outreach to libraries – I can walk your staff through the tips and materials, then give you slides 
and talking points, if you’d like to use them in your programming. 

If you have any questions, please call or e-mail Carol at 202-326-3152 or ckando@ftc.gov.

A RATING SYSTEM FOR WEBSITES
Submitted by Carmen Redding

Are you having trouble deciding if a website is sharing the truth or feeding you a line? In August, NewsGuard, 
a news literacy program, was launched with the support from Microsoft. Staffed by almost 40 reporters 
and  dozens  of  freelancers,  the  NewsGuard  team  diligently  examined  thousands  of  websites  based  on 
nine widely-accepted, journalistic criteria designed to minimize human bias and subjectivity. The results 
determine if the sites receive green or red ratings.

Steven Brill and Gordon Crovitz, NewsGuard Technologies’ co-founders and co-CEOs, joined forces to give 
this program a human face rather than relying on algorithms to determine what we see. NewsGuard is the 
opposite of an algorithm. People with journalistic backgrounds are reviewing the sites. “Algorithms don’t 
call for comment,” says Brill. NewsGuard, on the other hand, gives plenty of explanation about their ratings. 

Stacey	Aldrich,	State	Librarian	of	Hawaii	and	President	of	the	Chief	Officers	of	State	Library	Agencies	(COSLA),	
spoke  about  NewsGuard  and  was  quoted  as  saying, “We’re  delighted  to  be  partnering  with  NewsGuard  
in this common-sense news literacy initiative. Adding this service continues the long tradition of librarians 
arming readers with more information about what they are reading.” 

NewsGuard  works  as  a  browser  plug-in,  giving  credibility  ratings  to  thousands  of  websites.  A  user  
simply  downloads  the  extension  on  Google  Chrome,  Microsoft  Edge,  Firefox,  and  Safari.  To  get  that 
extension, click here.

After the extension is downloaded, one of the various NewsGuard icons will appear in the upper right corner 
of  the  browser  toolbar. The  rating  icons  also  appear  on  the  search  pages.  By  hovering  over  the  colored 
icon, a “Nutrition Label” appears. This label explains how NewsGuard decided the site’s rating. Additional 
information  such  as  the  site’s  ownership  and  financing,  content  credibility,  transparency  and  history  
is  explained.  Ratings  and  label  information  are  updated  regularly,  and  whenever  a  site  changes  its  
practices, the icon will be adjusted accordingly. NewsGuard’s ratings will also be accessible on Facebook 
and Twitter when website articles are used.

NewsGuard’s website has more information about the nine journalistic criteria and the icons they use.

PRIMARY & SECONDARY LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This is the second in a series of Flickertale articles that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s legal 
reference resources. See the October 2018 Flickertale for the first article in the series, North Dakota Legal 
Research Resources in a Nutshell.

Next  month’s  article  will  get  into  more  detail  about  legal  research  resources  for  the  North  Dakota  State 
Constitution.

WHAT ARE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES OF LAW?
All legal information comes from either a primary or secondary source. For legal research, and when referring 
a patron to legal research resources, it is helpful to know the basic difference.

Primary  sources  of  law  are  the  law  itself,  which  includes  the  constitution  and  laws  created  by  the 
legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. 

Primary sources of law include:
•	
•	
•	
•	

The United States Constitution and the North Dakota State Constitution.
Legislative Branch: The North Dakota Century Code; City or County ordinances. 
Executive Branch: Regulations enacted by North Dakota State Agencies; Executive orders; Treaties.
Judicial Branch: Case law; Procedural rules.

Sometimes, a patron wants to know what the law was on a specific date or timeframe. Historical primary 
sources of law provide the answer. Historical primary sources include the same list as above, but give the 
law  in  effect  as  of  a  past  publication  date. Tips  for  finding  historical  primary  sources  will  be  included  in 
future articles.

Secondary  sources  of  law  are  written  by  third  parties  who  discuss,  explain,  interpret  or  analyze 
primary sources of law.

Secondary sources of law include:
•	
•	

Legal Dictionaries: i.e. Black’s Law Dictionary; NOLO’s Plain-English Law Dictionary.
Legal	Encyclopedias:	i.e.	Corpus	Juris	Secundum	(CJS);	American	Jurisprudence	2d	(Am	Jur	2d);	NOLO’s	
Encyclopedia of Everyday Law.
Law  reviews  and  journals:  i.e.  North  Dakota  Law  Review;  journals  published  by  the  American  Bar 
Association on a variety of topics.
Treatises:  i.e.  the  Nutshell  series  published  by  West  Academic  Publishing  on  a  variety  of  topics;  the 
Wigmore treatise on evidence.

•	

•	

•	 North Dakota Pattern Jury Instructions.
•	 North Dakota Legal Self Help Center guides and forms, covering a variety of civil court processes.

Secondary  sources  can  help  a  patron  learn  about  an  area  of  law  and  help  them  locate  primary  sources 
related to their legal issue. If a patron is unfamiliar with an area of law, secondary sources are a handy way 
to start their legal research.

North Dakota’s secondary sources will be covered more thoroughly in a future article. In the meantime, ODIN 
Interlibrary Loan is a handy resource for print secondary sources. The North Dakota Pattern Jury Instructions 
and the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center’s secondary sources are available at www.ndcourts.gov/ndlshc.

NOVEMBER 2018

Continued from pg. 13

PRIMARY SOURCES OF LAW ARE EITHER MANDATORY OR PERSUASIVE:

All primary sources of law are either mandatory or persuasive.

Mandatory  primary  sources  are  those  statutes,  rules,  or  regulations  that  the  court  must  follow 
because they are binding on the court. For example, North Dakota statutes in the North Dakota Century 
Code are binding on North Dakota state courts; opinions of the North Dakota Supreme Court are binding 
on all North Dakota state courts.

Persuasive primary sources are those statutes, rules, or regulations that the court may follow but 
doesn’t have to follow.  For  example,  statutes  enacted  by  another  state  and  case  law  from  courts  from 
another  state  are  not  binding.  This  means  that  North  Dakota  state  courts,  including  the  North  Dakota 
Supreme Court, can choose whether to follow the same reasoning as another state court.

In North Dakota, it’s fairly common to find that little or no mandatory primary source of law exists to answer 
a legal question. Persuasive primary sources can be useful to add support to existing mandatory primary 
sources, or to support a legal argument when no mandatory primary source exists.

Herring  v.  Lisbon  Partners  Credit  Fund,  Ltd.  Partnership,  2012  ND  226,  823  N.W.2d  493  is  an  example  of 
a  legal  issue  where  no  mandatory  primary  source  of  law  existed  and  the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court 
analyzed	persuasive	primary	sources	of	law	to	reach	a	decision.	(www.ndcourts.gov/Research)

SECONDARY SOURCES OF LAW ARE ALWAYS PERSUASIVE:

All secondary sources of law are persuasive. Because all secondary sources of law are persuasive, they are 
not binding on North Dakota courts.

Remember, secondary sources of law are handy legal reference resources for understanding an unfamiliar 
area of law, and for finding references to primary sources of law.

INTERLIBRARY LOAN SUGGESTIONS:

Some of the secondary sources of law listed above are available via ODIN Interlibrary Loan from both the 
North Dakota Supreme Court Law Library and the University of North Dakota Thormodsgard Law Library.

NOLO titles are written specifically for people without legal background.

Nutshell titles, published by West Academic Publishing, are written for law students and attorneys, but are 
still a useful legal research tool for many self-represented individuals.

Please take a look at the NOLO, Nutshell, and other titles available for ODIN Interlibrary Loan through your 
local library. We would to share with you!

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
