We Have A New Catalog!
Submitted by Al Peterson

On  December  11,  2019,  ODIN  officially  split  into  
two  different  catalogs.  The  North  Dakota  State 
Library,  along  with  schools  and  public  libraries  
that  use  ODIN  migrated  to  III  Polaris  while  the 
Academic  libraries  will  continue  using  ExLibris’s 
ALEPH  until  they  migrate  to  ExLibris’s  ALMA  in  
July  2020.  Polaris  offers    a  web-based  client  for 
patron  services  and  circulation.  Along  with  a  new 
circulation system, we have a new online catalog. 

If  you  have  the  old  catalog  bookmarked,  please 
update  your  links  so  that  you  are  looking  at  
the  new  catalog,  https://polaris.odinlibrary.org/
polaris/default.aspx.

The  new  catalog  offers  some  really  cool  features, 
such  as  the  ability  of  saving  a  list  of  what  you  
have  checked  out.  When  doing  a  quick  search,  
one  of  the  new  options  you  have  is  to  limit  by  
fiction  or  nonfiction  from  the  beginning  of  the 
search.  You  can  also  change  your  password  and 
create a user name on your own. 

This  new  catalog  doesn’t  allow  for  requests  for 
materials  not  found  in  the  ODIN  system  as  of  
yet.  If  you  do  need  something  that  you  can’t  
find  in  the  catalog,  e-mail  the  author,  title,  and  
any  other 
to  us  at  
information  you  have 
statelib@nd.gov,  and  we’ll  submit  an  interlibrary 
loan request on your behalf.

further  assistance  on

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

It  is  not  only  a  new  year,  but  it  is  a  new  decade.  
I’ve  been  having  lots  of  fun  playing  with  the  
“Roaring  20’s,”  wishing  people  a  roaring  good  
year/decade,  and  other  such  similar  silly  things. 
I  told  my  mom  to  dust  off  her  flapper  dress  to  
which  she  replied,  “I  was  born  in  the  40s,  so  I  
don’t have one.”  That made me giggle. 

year,  creating  a  new  strategic  framework  that  will 
guide  our  services  and  programs.  I  want  to  be  
very  intentional  in  the  execution  of  these  two 
documents  to  ensure  that  the  State  Library 
continues  to  meet  the  needs  of  our  patrons,  
North  Dakota  librarians  and  library  staff,  and  the 
citizens of North Dakota. 

As  we  enter  a  new  decade  and  as  I  enter  my  
sixth  year  of  service  at  the  State  Library,  it  is  a  
great  time  to  reflect  on  where  we’ve  been,  where 
we  want  to  go,  and  how  we  want  to  get  there.  
I’ve  shared  in  past  columns  that  I  am  hit  or  miss 
when  it  comes  to  New  Year’s  resolutions.  The  last 
few  years,  I  haven’t  focused  on  resolutions  but  
rather  on  a  word  for  the  year.  I  saw  a  segment  on 
North  Dakota  Today  /  NBC  that  talked  about  this 
very  thing:  choose  a  word  or  words  to  focus  on  
for  the  year.  I  have  chosen  the  word  “intentional”  
for  2020.  I  want  to  be  intentional  in  what  I  do  
and say this year, both professionally and personally. 

Professionally,  I  want  to  focus  on  continuing  to  
make  connections  in  the  North  Dakota  library 
community  and  beyond.  I  really  hope  to  visit  
some  new  libraries  this  year.  If  I’ve  visited  your  
library,  consider  inviting  me  to  visit  again.  It  is  so 
valuable  for  me  to  visit  North  Dakota  libraries. 
Our  Librarian  for  a  Day  program  is  an  excellent 
opportunity  to  invite  me  out  to  spend  the  day  
at  your  library.  If  you  are  having  any  kind  of  
event  such  as  an  anniversary  celebration,  a  
special  program,  or  Tuesday  storytime,  I  would  
be thrilled to come and join you. I can also provide 
training  if  you  are  doing  a  staff  day  or  would  like 
some  help  with  strategic  planning,  a  workshop  
for  trustees,  or  anything  similar.  Basically,  it  is  
pretty wide open. Just invite me for a visit. 

The  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  Council  
is  currently  in  the  process  of  updating  the  Library 
Vision  document.  The  State  Library  will  be 
undergoing  an  update  to  our  strategic  plan  this 

One  goal  I  want  to  be  very  intentional  about  
this  year  is  communication.  I  want  to  connect  
with  people  more  personally  through 
letters,  
phone  calls,  emails  and  texts  as  well  as  on  social 
media. 
I  don’t  want  to  simply  scroll  through 
on  social  media  and  like  posts,  though.  I  want 
to  engage  in  conversation  or  at  least  leave  a  
comment.  I  love  reading  about  all  the  wonderful 
things  North  Dakota  libraries  and  library  staff  are 
doing.  If  we’re  not  connected  on  social  media,  
send me a friend request  if you’d  like  to connect. I 
think  I’m  following  all  North  Dakota  libraries  on 
Facebook,  but  if  I’m  not  following  your  library,  
please 
let  me  know.  You  can  find  me  on 
Twitter  as  well,  although  I’m  not  as  great  about  
checking  Twitter  as  I  am  Facebook,  so  email  or 
text  is  still  a  better  way  to  get  my  attention.  (I 
have  a  work  cellphone  now.  Please  let  me  know  
if you need that number.)

I  encourage  you  to  spend  some  time  reflecting 
on  what  goals  you’d  like  to  accomplish  this  year, 
either  as  an  individual,  as  an  organization,  or  
both.  Consider  writing  a 
few  resolutions  or  
choosing  a  word  to  guide  you  through  the  year. 
Please  share  your  resolutions  or  guiding  word  
with me. I love to discuss goals and how you hope  
to  achieve  them.  Wishing  you  a  very  happy  and 
roarin’ New Year!

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

RBdigital

The  holiday  season  is  over  and  perhaps  you  received  a  new  tablet  and  don’t  know  what  to  do  with  it.  
If  it  is  an  Apple,  Android,  or  Kindle  Fire  device,  we  have  an  app  for  you.  RBdigital  is  our  e-book,  
e-audiobook,  e-magazine,  and  e-comic  book  services  that  is  app-based  and  can  be  found  in  the  
app  store  for  your  device.  In  order  to  have  an  RBdigital  account,  you  will  need  to  have  either  a  public  
library card or a library card from the North Dakota State Library. With that, you can register by creating  
a  username  and  password  with  your  library  card  number,  and  then,  you  will  only  need  to  remember  
your login from there on. 

When  you  are  in  the  app,  you  have  the  choice  to  look  at  any  of  the  four  options  we  have  available,  
but  if  you  want  to  find  a  specific  item,  just  click  on  the  magnifying  glass  in  the  upper  right  hand  
corner. There,  you  choose  if  you  want  to  search  through  books,  audiobooks,  magazines,  or  comics. You  
can  select  to  search  by  keyword,  title,  or  author  of  the  item.  After  finding  the  item  you  are  looking  
for,  it  will  tell  you  if  it  is  available  for  checkout  or  if  you  need  to  put  a  hold  on  it.  If  you  want  to  check  
it  out,    click  that;  if  you  want  to  put  a  hold  on  it,  click  “hold”.  The  system  will  email  you  when  your  
hold  is  available.  Once  you  have  your  item,  click  on  the  three  little  lines  on  the  left  hand  side  of  
the  page  and  then  find  “checked  out”.  From  there,  you  can  see  everything  you  have  checked  out.  
Once  you  click  “download”  under  your  item,  it  will  download  the  book  to  your  device.  After  the  
download  is  complete,  you  will  not  need  to  be  connected  to  wifi  or  data  to  read.  When  the  book  is  
due,  it  will  delete  from  your  account.  If  you  finish  before  it  is  due,  in  this  same  area,  you  just  click  on  
the “x” on the right hand side of the item, and that will return it to the collection.

RBdigital  is  a  great  resource  for  those  people  who  don’t  have  the  time  to  browse  a  library.  If  you  
have any questions about this database or others, please let us know at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

Newest School Librarian Resource
Submitted by Carmen Redding 

Are  you  tired  of  juggling  links  and  checking  browser  bookmarks  for  information  you  think  you  saved 
concerning AASL resources, State credentialing and renewals, lesson planning, policy development, etc.? 
Would  you  like  to  have  a “one-stop  shop”?  I  know  I  find  material  that  I  want  to  connect  with  later,  and 
when later arrives, I’m searching my brain, work and home computer browsers, and sticky notes to find  
that information.

Well,  2020  is  upon  us,  and  my  thoughts  are  focused  on  ways  to  help  school  librarians.  I  have  decided  
that  one  way  I  can  serve  you  is  by  developing  a  handbook.  I  could  use  your  input.  What  information  
would you like to see in this digital document? I want this to be your useful guide. Shoot me an email. I  
have begun this work in our newest resource, LibGuides.

Currently,  the  Library  Development  office  at  the  State  Library  have  developed  guides  on  these  topics:  
Fake  News,  Grants,  Reader’s  Advisory,  Rights  Statements,  and  STEM  kits.  This  School  Librarian’s  
Handbook will be found using the same link as above. I will publish the first iteration in February.

Letters About Literature
The  deadline  for  the  North  Dakota  Letters  About  Literature  contest  is  only  one  month  away  
on  February  14.  This  state-level  reading/writing  promotion  program  is  for  students  in  grades  
4-12.  Students  are  asked  to  read  a  book,  poem,  or  speech  and  write  a  letter  to  the  author  (living  
or dead) about how the book affected them personally. 

Students will compete in three age categories: Level 1 (grades 4-6), Level 2 (grades 7-8), and Level 3 
(grades 9-12). At each level, winners will receive $150 for first place, $100 for second place, and $50 
for third place.

More information and the link to submit your letter can be found at www.library.nd.gov/letters.html.

If you have any questions, please contact Shari Mosser at ssandwick@nd.gov or 1-800-472-2104.

YouTube Video of the Month:  
North Dakota State Library Orientation
Submitted by Angie Houser
North  Dakota  State  Library  has  been  around  for  a  long  time.  In 
honor of its 90th anniversary in 1997, the library made a video as an 
orientation to what the state library does and has to offer citizens of 
North Dakota. This video explains what ODIN is and how the library 
participates in it and going over the different aspects of the library 
including  reference  services,  the  Talking  Books  department,  and 
being a Federal Document repository. For a blast from the past, make 
sure to check out this video!

Programming Spotlight: Preschool STEM
Submitted by Abby Ebach

STEM  isn’t  all  coding  and  robots;  you  can  transform  any  storytime  craft  or  messy  toddler  
time  into  an  enriching,  STEM-filled  experience.  Consider  using  the  scientific  method  to  see  
what  liquids  will  dissolve  your  tasty  treats—can  peeps  and  M&M’s  survive  water,  seltzer,  
vegetable  oil,  and  vinegar?  Create  a  beautiful  rainbow  using  nothing  but  a  plastic  plate,  Skittles, 
and  warm  water.  Better  yet,  in  my  opinion,  is  constructing  objects  using  spaghetti  noodles  
and  gum  drops  to  see  who  can  make  the  tallest  and  most  structurally-sound  pyramid  or 
bridge.  Get  more  fun  ideas  by  checking  out  Play  to  Learn  Preschool’s  blog  post  or  do  your  own  
exploring by searching “Preschool STEM” on Pinterest.

2020 Census And How It Will Impact Libraries 
Wednesday, January 29 (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM CST) 

Register: http://bit.ly/2T1EEW1 

The  2020  Census  will  determine  the  distribution  of  over  $675  billion  in  annual  allocations  to  
communities.  This  will  be  the  first  time  the  Census  will  offer  an  online  self-response  option.  With  25%  
of  housing  units  without  internet  connectivity,  these  individuals  may  be  using  library  resources  to  
respond.  We  will  discuss  the  complexities  of  the  Census  and  how  libraries  can  assist  in  helping  secure  
an accurate count in their communities.

Librarian as Verb: Activate Your Rural Community 
Wednesday, February 5 (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM CST)  

Register: http://bit.ly/2QzLZcC 

Making  connections  and  being  an  active  part  of  the  community  you  serve  is  especially  important  in  
small  and  rural  libraries.  It  makes  your  library  more  visible  and  also  enhances  the  quality  of  life  in  the 
community. Learn how a rural library director transformed library services over one summer, by getting  
out  and  growing  awareness  in  the  community.  With  the  help  of  two  enthusiastic  staff,  one  simple  
idea  grew  into  so  much  more. We  will  explore  different  ways  to  engage  your  community,  spark  young 
readers, and build relationships with families. Hear tips, tools, and personal stories about how the library 
implemented outreach services and created ways to positively impact the entire community! Learn how  
to make “librarian” not only your job title, but what you actively do.

Civil Legal Justice: The Crucial Role of Libraries 
Tuesday, February 11 (2:00 PM-3:00 PM) 

Register: http://bit.ly/2F71e7F

The  lofty  U.S.  ideal  of  “justice  for  all”  fails  the  equity  test  because  many  people,  especially  our  
nation’s  poorest  individuals,  fall  into  the  “justice  gap”—the  divide  between  the  civil  legal  needs  of  
low-income  people  and  the  resources  to  meet  those  needs.  Many  of  your  community  members  who 
instinctively  turn  to  the  library  for  help  with  crises  in  their  lives  might  be  on  the  verge  of  falling  into  
this  gap. Though  legal  issues  can  be  intimidating  for  library  staff,  public  libraries  are  well  positioned  to

JANUARY 2020

By Jessica Robinson

A  new  decade  is  upon  us,  and  there’s  no  better  
way  to  celebrate  the  return  to  the  Roaring  
Twenties  than  to  add  a  few  new  books  to  our  
reading 
lists.  This  month,  we’ll  make  some 
resolutions,  pack  up  our  holiday  decorations,  
and get excited about the new books of 2020.

The  opioid  epidemic  is  a  familiar  topic  in  the  US 
,and  Liz  Moore  takes  us  deep  into  the  personal 
heart  of  this  crisis  with  Long  Bright  River.  This  
is  the  story  of  two  sisters:  Mickey,  a  cop  in  a  
long  
dangerous  Philadelphia  community,  has 
been  estranged  from  her  opioid-addicted  sister 
Kacey.  When  Kacey  goes  missing  and  a  series  
of  murders  hit  Mickey’s  streets,  she  begins  a 
desperate quest to find the murderer and her sister.

The  Love  Story  of  Missy  Carmichael  by  debut  
author  Beth  Morrey  is  about  starting  over  late  in  
life.  Missy  Carmichael  is  in  her  twilight  years, 
widowed,  estranged 
from  her  daughter,  and 
continents  away 
from  her  son  and  beloved 
follows  Missy  during 
grandchild.  This  book 
a  tumultuous  year  of  her  life  after  she  has  a  
chance  encounter  with  some  strangers  in  a  park 
and  begins  to  finally  explore  feelings  of  guilt  
over a secret from her youth.

Louise  Erdrich  is  a  familiar  name  in  these  parts,  
and,  in  The  Night  Watchman,  she  returns  to  rural  
North  Dakota  with 
the  stories  of  Thomas  
Wazhashk,  a  night  watchman  at  a  factory  near  
the  Turtle  Mountain  Reservation,  and  Patrice 
Paranteau,  a  bright  young  woman  eager  to  find  
out  what  happened  to  her  older  sister  after  she 
moved to Minneapolis. 

In  Stephanie  Wrobel’s  chilling  Darling  Rose  Gold,  
we  go  deep 
into  an  extremely  dysfunctional  
mother-daughter  relationship.  Rose  Gold  spent  
her  entire  childhood  thinking  that  she  was 
chronically  sick.  Then,  she  discovers  that  her  
mother  was  making  her  sick  and  her  testimony 
sends  her  mother  to  prison.  But,  now  her  mother  
is out. And Rose Gold wants revenge. 

N.K.  Jemisin  took  a  break  from  winning  Hugo  
awards  last  year  to  start  a  new  fantasy  series,  
in  New  York  City.  The  City  We  
this  time  set 
Became 
letter  to  one  of  the  most  
love 
is  a 
famous  cities  on  earth  and  explores  an  ancient  
evil  that  sleeps  underneath  it.  When  that  evil  
begins  to  stir,  five  disparate  people  rise  up  to  
protect it. 

The  Beauty  of  Your  Face  by  Sahar  Mustafah  
explores  a  nightmarish  situation  when  a  Muslim 
school  for  girls  in  Chicago  is  attacked  by  an  
alt-right  shooter.  Afaf  Rahman,  the  principal  and 
a  child  of  Palestinian  immigrants,  is  trapped  in  
the  school  as  we  explore  her  past,  following 
her  through  the  devastation  of  her  older  sister’s 
disappearance to the bigotry she faced throughout 
her life.

to 

I  might  be  the  most  excited  this  year  to  read 
Destination  Wedding  by  Diksha  Basu,  a  loving  
tribute 
family,  excess,  and  self-discovery.  
Tina  Das  is  at  a  crossroads  in  life,  unsure  whether  
she  belongs  in  America  or  India  and  very  unsure 
about  her  feelings  for  the  handsome  Australian 
who  still  hasn’t  called  her  back.  So  what  better 
place  to  center  herself  than  at  her  cousin’s  
massive, weeklong Delhi wedding? 

in 

the  Universe.  Sara  Seager 

Last,  we  pick  up  some  nonfiction  with  Sara  
Seager’s  heartbreaking  memoir  The  Smallest  
Lights 
is  an  
astrophysicist  for  MIT,  and  this  book  explores  
her life after the death of her husband, a planetary 
scientist.  It  follows  her  struggles  as  the  single 
mother  of  two  young  boys  while  she  continues 
doing  brilliant  work  for  the  space  program  and 
begins falling for an amateur astronomer.

just  begun,  so  we  still  have  
This  year  has 
eleven  months  of  new  books  to  explore.  Next 
month,  we’ll  get  a  little  romantic  with  some  of  
2020’s most highly anticipated romance novels.

Legal Research Resources For 
Driving Under The Influence (DUI)

 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

Driving under the influence, or DUI, is a frequently 
requested  legal  research  topic  by  attorneys  and  
self-represented  patrons  of  the  North  Dakota 
Supreme Court Law Library.

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources 
available in North Dakota for DUI.

WHAT IS DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
(DUI)?

Driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)  is  the  crime  
or  offense  of  operating  a  motor  vehicle  after 
too  much  alcohol,  drugs,  or  a 
consuming 
combination  of  alcohol  and  drugs.    DUI  may  also  
be  called  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI),  drunk 
driving, and drinking and driving.

Each  state  decides  the  level  of  alcohol  and/or  
drugs  at  which  a  person  can’t  safely  operate  a  
motor  vehicle.    Each  state  also  decides  what  the 
penalties will be for committing DUI.

CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCESSES FOR DUI

In  North  Dakota,  when  a  ticket  for  DUI  is  issued,  
two separate processes begin.  The criminal process 
and the administrative process.

Criminal Process: DUI is a criminal offense under 
North Dakota state law.

Criminal  offenses,  such  as  DUI,  are  considered 
harmful  to  society  as  a  whole.    Only  the  state 
or  local  government  can  charge  an  individual 
with  DUI.    If  the  criminal  charge  is  filed  with  the  
court,  the  individual  is  prosecuted  by  the  State’s 
Attorney  for  the  North  Dakota  county,  or  the 
attorney for the local government.

When  the  criminal  court  process  results  in  a  DUI 
conviction,  the  resulting  criminal  penalties  may 
include fines, jail, probation, or a combination.

The  website  for  the  North  Dakota  Department  of 
Transportation lists the penalties for North Dakota 
DUI convictions. 

Sections 54-12-27 to 54-12-31 of the North Dakota 
Century  Code  contains  North  Dakota’s  state  laws 
related to the 24/7 Sobriety Program.

Administrative  Process:  DUI  also  results  in  an 
administrative  process  through  the  North  Dakota 
Department  of Transportation  (NDDOT),  which  is 
separate from the criminal process.

When  a  ticket  for  DUI  is  issued  to  an  individual,  
the  ticket  is  also  transmitted  to  the  NDDOT.   This 
begins  the  NDDOT’s  administrative  process  to  
decide  whether  to  take  action  against  the 
individual’s  drivers  license.    If  an  administrative 
hearing  is  requested  and  held,  an  Administrative 
Law  Judge  (ALJ),  makes  the  decision  about  
whether  the  individual’s  drivers  license  will  be 
suspended or revoked.

The  North  Dakota  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure 
govern  how  a  criminal  case  makes  its  way  to  
a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  and  how  the 
criminal case is conducted. 

ND LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE DUI PROCESS

Chapter 28-32 of the North Dakota Century Code 
contains  North  Dakota’s  state  laws  related  to 
administrative agency adjudicative processes.

An  administrative  agency  adjudicative  process  is 
an  administrative  matter  resulting  in  the  agency 
issuing  a  decision  or  order  after  an  opportunity  
for hearing is provided or required.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
