TUTORND HAS BEEN 
DISCONTINUED

As  of  June  30,  2019,  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  
has  stopped  subscribing 
to  TutorND.com.  We 
appreciate  the  partnership  we’ve  had  with  Tutor,  
but  usage  of  the  service  has  dropped  in  recent  
internal  database  
years.  The  State  Library’s 
committee  performs  an  annual  evaluation  of 
each  database,  looking  at  usage  statistics  for  the 
prior  three  years  as  well  as  a  Return  on  Investment 
(ROI)  for  each  database.  In  May,  we  presented  our 
recommendation  on  database  changes  to  the  
North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  Council  who  
serves as our external database committee and they 
approved of the changes.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact 
Angie at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

PLEASE RETURN KITS ON TIME

There  are  172  STEM,  Book  Club,  and  Display  kits 
available  through  NDSL.  The  kits  are  very  popular 
with  libraries  across  the  state,  and  we  would  like  to 
remind you that they are on a very tight schedule to 
turn-around kits once they are returned to us.

Kits can be reserved up to a year in advance, and they 
are  oftentimes  booked  back-to-back.  This  means 
that if a kit is delayed in getting back to NDSL, it can 
disrupt the schedule for countless libraries for up to  
a year into the future. 

Please  be  kind  to  your  fellow  librarians  and  return 
your  book  club  kit  before  or  on  the  due  date.  (And 
remember  that  the  due  date  is  the  date  we  expect 
it to be at the State Library, not the day it should be 
shipped to us.)

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact 
the State Library at 701-328-4622.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

I  recently  accompanied  our  Center  for  the 
Book  Coordinator  (and  ILL  Manager)  Shari 
Mosser  to  the  National  Book  Festival.  We  
had  interesting  but  little  known  facts  about 
North  Dakota  posted  in  our  booth.  We  also 
handed  out  buttons  that  said  that “Books  Are 
My  Happy  Place.”  People  loved  the  buttons,  
and we also got lots of comments on our facts. 
It  is  always  interesting  to  attend  an  event  
like  the  National  Book  Festival  because  lots  
of  people  have  a  North  Dakota  connection, 
even if it’s that ours is the last state they have  
to visit. This comment is not infrequent. 

I  had  the  opportunity  to  attend  a  reception  
the  night  before  at  the  Library  of  Congress 
where  I  was  happy  to  have  the  chance  to  
speak  briefly  to  and  take  a  picture  with  
Librarian  of  Congress,  Carla  Hayden,  who  I  
really  admire,  as  well  as  connect  with  several 
other  State  Librarians  and  staff  from  the 
Institute  of  Museum  and  Library  Services  
(IMLS).  It  is  always  great  to  connect  with 
my  State  Librarian  peers,  and  I  enjoyed  this 
opportunity.  We  listened  to  a  presentation  
from  four  of  the  authors  at  the  festival;  they 
were  rich  and  full  and  very  impactful.  The 
State Librarian from Vermont, Jason, turned to 
me  after  one  of  the  talks  and  said, “there  was 
so  much  there  I’m  going  to  have  to  unpack 
it  tonight.”  I  felt  that  way  about  several  of  
the talks. 

route 

From  Washington,  D.C.,  I  traveled  to  Rhode 
Island  where  my  colleague,  Karen,  acted  as  
Tour  Guide  Extraordinaire.  She  even  planned  
my 
through  Maine,  New  
Hampshire,  and Vermont,  which  was  my  final 
destination.  I  thoroughly  enjoyed  my  tour 
of  New  England.  So  often,  when  traveling  for 
business,  I  don’t  have  the  chance  to  get  out  

for  me 

and  enjoy  the  local  area,  so  having  a  few 
extra  days  to  do  so  was  a  real  blessing.  It 
was  absolutely  lovely  to  see  so  many  trees, 
bubbling  brooks,  covered  bridges,  and  other 
things  that  I  stumbled  upon  during  my  drive. 
My  eventual  destination  was  Burlington, 
Vermont,  for  the  Association  for  Rural  and  
Small  Libraries  Conference.  Almost  700 
librarians  attended  this  conference  from  48 
states;  we  had  15  North  Dakota  librarians  in 
attendance  at  the  conference.  Several  of  us 
went  to  dinner  together  one  evening,  and  I 
thoroughly  enjoyed  the  great  conversation, 
laughs,  and  even  dancing  at  the  end  of  the 
evening.  I  always  look  forward  to  connecting 
with my “ARSL peeps” each year at conference. 
Many  of  them  are  now  colleagues  that  I  am 
honored and thankful to also call friends. 

I  am  looking  forward  to  the  upcoming  North 
Dakota Library Association Conference (NDLA). 
It  will  be  a  wonderful  time  with  my  North 
Dakota  Library  Land  colleagues  to  connect, 
learn, and, I’m sure, laugh. Paulette from Minot 
and  I  will  once  again  be  coordinating  the  
live  and  silent  auctions,  so  please  come  with 
your checkbook or credit card in hand. 

Conferences  and  events  such  as  the  National 
Book  Festival  are  about  learning,  but  they 
are  also  very  much  about  networking  with 
colleagues  and  expanding  your  library  land 
circle.  I  am  grateful  to  have  the  chance  to 
connect  with  my  “Library  Peeps”  from  across 
the  spectrum.  I  always  learn  lots,  laugh  a  ton, 
and  get  refreshed,  energized,  and  renewed.  
If  you  have  an  opportunity  to  attend  a 
conference  or  a  continuing  education  event, 
I  encourage  you  to  take  it  and  to  participate 
fully. You never know when the person sitting 
next to you will become a lifelong friend.

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

ACADEMY SEARCH PREMIER

Not only does the State Library offer great databases to improve your skills and leisure time but 
we  also  have  databases  that  are  perfect  for  research.  Many  of  these  databases  hold  scholarly,  
peer-reviewed  resources  that  will  work  for  supporting  a  report  or  paper.  One  such  database  is 
Academic Search Premier. 

This  database  searches  journals,  research  papers,  books,  and  more  for  the  most  relevant  
information  to  your  search  topic.  After  finding  all  of  the  items  that  are  within  your  search  term  
you  can  refine  the  results  on  the  left  hand  side  of  the  page.  Say  you  only  want  information  
published  during  a  certain  set  of  years,  you  can  adjust  the  years  on  this  part  of  the  page. This  
will  adjust  the  amount  of  items  to  go  through  and  will  give  the  most  relevant  articles  to  your  
research. On this same side, you can choose other databases to search, additional subject terms,  
and even choose which language you want the results to come in. 

When looking for the perfect resource, it is important to notice if the database has access to the  
full article or just the abstract. It will tell you on the search page if the PDF Full Text or HTML Full  
Text  are  available  before  you  even  read  the  abstract.  When  you  find  an  article  that  works  for  
your research, you can save it to a folder with a free account, email the item, print, or save it to  
your computer. In addition to these saving options there are options to cite the article, translate 
it, and create notes on different parts of it. All of these options will create a more robust research 
experience and give the best resources for whatever research is needed.  

For more information on this database and others contact ndsltrain@nd.gov. 

DID YOU KNOW?

North Dakota has the 2nd highest number of outreach vehicles per capita in the 
United States (not including book-bikes). There is one outreach vehicle for every 
62,949 people. Kentucky comes in 1st place with one outreach vehicle for every 
59,959 people.

SCHOOL TOURS AND TRAININGS

The  State  Library  is  open  for  tours! We  provide  free  tours 
to school groups, and we are located right on the capitol 
grounds.  If  you’re  coming  to  the  Capitol  and/or  the  
Heritage  Center,  let  us  know,  and  we  can  arrange  a  tour 
date and time with you.

In addition to tours, the Continuing Education Coordinator 
can  travel  to  your  school  for  professional  development 
days. We will speak to the school staff and administrators  
on  what  the  State  Library  has  to  offer  to  teachers  and 
librarians for programming and/or research.

For more information, contact the North Dakota State Library at 1-800-472-2104 or ndsltrain@nd.gov.

ANNUAL REPORT TO GOVERNING BODY
Submitted by Trevor Martinson

Did you know that North Dakota public libraries are required by law to submit an annual report to their 
governing body (either the city and/or county commission)? NDCC 40-38-09 outlines what needs to be 
included, but there are numerous ways in which this annual report could be approached. 

Your  report  should  be  organized,  well-thought-out,  visual,  and  informative.  With  a  little  time  and 
dedication, you should be able to create a report without any issues. Take advantage of resources like 
Word and Publisher to help create your report.

Fun  facts  about  the  library,  highlights  from  the  past  year,  photographs,  and  any  other  relevant 
information  should  absolutely  be  included  in  the  report.  Definitely  include  information  from  your 
library’s most recent Public Library Survey (the annual report that is submitted to the State Library). 
However,  you  should  NOT  just  print  this  off  and  submit  it  as  your  annual  report  to  the  governing  
body.  The  raw  data  in  the  PLS  can  be  bland,  and  it  includes  information  that  the  governing  body  
may not understand without proper context. 

Numbers can really drive the point home. However, don’t use too many figures. That may overwhelm 
folks.  Consider  doing  something  fun  with  the  data,  like  an  infographic.  Infographics  are  brief  and  
visual. You  don’t  have  to  be  a  graphic  designer  to  create  an  infographic. You  can  easily  create  free 
infographics online by using websites like Canva. 

And  don’t  forget,  this  report  can  also  serve  another  purpose:  advocacy.  Never  miss  an  opportunity  
to advocate for your library, and the annual report to the governing body is a wonderful opportunity 
to  do  this.  The  governing  body  should  be  able  to  review  the  report  and  visualize  the  impact  the  
library is making in the community. 

Additional information and examples are available on the State Library’s blog.

SEPTEMBER 2019

By Jessica Robinson

Historical  fiction  is  a  versatile  genre—casting 
its  wide  net  over  all  of  human  history  (and 
sometimes beyond). This month we’ll take a look 
at  the  historical  fiction  of  2019  and  see  what  
we can learn about what’s come before us.

Lyndsay  Faye  started  the  year  off  with  a  literal  
bang  in  The Paragon Hotel when  Alice “Nobody” 
James  flees  a  Prohibition-era  New  York  after  a 
botched  liquor  deal  ended  in  a  shootout  and 
finds  refuge  in  an  all-black  hotel  in  Portland.  
Rhys  Bowen’s  The  Victory  Garden  jumps  forward  
a  few  more  years  to  World  War  I,  where  a  
pregnant  Emily  Bryce  finds  comfort 
in  the 
neglected  gardens  of  a  Devonshire  estate  after 
her  pilot  lover  is  lost  to  the  war.  Next,  we  cross  
the  ocean  to  dusty  Kansas  to  explore  the  
friendship  between  a  young  Judy  Garland  and 
L.  Frank  Baum’s  widow  Maud  in  Finding Dorothy 
by  Elizabeth  Letts.  Kate  Quinn  delves  into  an 
intriguing  bit  of  WW2  history  in  The  Huntress  
where  she  follows  the  exploits  of  a  member 
of  the  Night  Witches,  an  all-female  group  of 
Russian aviators, as she tracks a Nazi war criminal 
to  America.  After  that,  go  back  a  few  hundred 
years  to  1793  in  Niklas  Natt  och  Dag’s  The  Wolf 
and  the  Watchman,  a  suspenseful  mystery  set  
in a Stockholm that’s still reeling after the death 
of their king. 

Stephanie  Thornton  is  a  queen  of  historical  
fiction  and  that’s  well  on  display  in  American 
Princess,  a  story  centering  around  Theodore 
Roosevelt’s 
infamous  daughter  Alice  as  she  
fights  to  be  heard  in  Washington  during  her 
father’s  time  in  office.  After  that,  we  race  to  the 
1960s  in  Chanel  Cleeston’s  When  We  Left  Cuba 
where  a  Cuban  sugar  heiress  named  Beatriz  
Perez  is  recruited  by  the  CIA  to  spy  on  Fidel  
Castro.  From  the  Cold  War  to  the  Trojan  War  
comes  A  Thousand  Ships  by  Natalie  Haynes,  a 
sweeping  account  of  the  Trojan  War  from  the 
perspective  of  several  women  (and  goddesses) 
across  Greece  and  above.  Readers  will  find  a 

new kindred spirit in the heroine of Kim Michele 
Richardson’s  The  Book  Woman  of  Troublesome 
Creek, a young Appalachian woman who afflicted 
with  a  rare  genetic  condition  that  turns  her 
skin  blue,  as  she  struggles  to  fulfill  her  quest  to 
deliver  books  to  impoverished  mountain  folk  
in  Kentucky.  The Electric Hotel  by  Dominic  Smith  
is  another  great  historical  fiction  novel  set  in  a 
hotel  but  this  time  it’s  the  home  of  a  reclusive 
French silent film director named Claude Ballard 
who  recounts  the  story  of  the  movie  which 
destroyed his career. 

The  Tenth  Muse  by  Catherine  Chung  revolves 
around  a  brilliant  mathematician  and  her  quest 
to solve the Riemann Hypothesis, a quest which 
leads  her  right  to World War  II  and  a  secret  that 
will  change  everything  she  thought  she  knew 
about  herself.  Next,  we  go  to  1953  Tehran  with 
Marjan Kamali’s The Stationery Shop and explore 
a  doomed  romance  set 
in  the  eponymous 
stationery  shop  during  the  Iranian  coup  d’etat. 
We  can  never  get  too  far  away  from  World  
War  II  in  historical  fiction,  and  Jeanne  Mackin’s 
The  Last  Collection  takes  us  right  back  in  with  
this  story  of  the  rivalry  between  fashion  icons 
Coco  Chanel  and  Elsa  Schiaparelli  on  the  eve  of 
the Nazi threat on Paris. The next book also takes 
a  close  look  at  a  famous  woman  of  history  in 
Meet Me in Monaco by Hazel Gaynor and Heather 
Webb, a story of a friendship between a perfume 
boutique  owner  and  the  legendary  performer 
Grace  Kelly.  Finally,  we  end  the  year  on  Today  
We  Go  Home  by  Kelli  Estes,  all  about  a  
PTSD-suffering  soldier  in  Afghanistan  and  the 
comfort she finds in the journal of a woman who  
disguised herself as a man to fight in the Civil War.

Next  month,  we  enter  into  my  favorite  time  of 
the  year  and  all  agree  to  spend  some  time  with 
a few ghosts and other assorted monsters as we 
explore 2019’s best and most highly anticipated 
horror novels.

NATIONAL BOOK FESTIVAL 2019
Submitted by Shari Mosser

Tens  of  thousands  of  book  lovers  appeared  at  the  
Walter E. Washington Convention Center for the 19th 
annual  Library  of  Congress  National  Book  Festival.  
The  festival,  held  on  August  31,  allowed  people  to 
celebrate  reading  and  meet  some  of  their  favorite 
authors.

Supreme  Court  Justice  Ruth  Bader  Ginsburg  drew  a 
record-setting  crowd  of  more  than  5,000  cheering 
people. Nina Totenberg interviewed Justice Ginsburg 
and discussed her book “My Own Words.” The Library 
of Congress livestreamed the event and it has had over 
13,000  views.  View  it,  as  well  as  other  videos  of  the 
event, here. 

Mary  Soucie  and  Shari  Mosser  represented  North  Dakota  at  the  Festival’s  Parade  of  States  where  
attendees  learned  about  the  literary  heritage  of  the  state.  The  beards  were  a  great  draw  for  many  
children  and  adults!  The  discussion  naturally  led  into  Chris  Rylander’s  book  “The  Legend  of  Greg  (An 
Epic  Series  of  Failures)”  which  was  North  Dakota’s  featured  book  for  “Discover  Great  Places  Through  
Reading.”  You can find out more about it at your local library.

Next year’s book festival will be held Saturday, August 29, 2020.

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT: STUFFED ANIMAL SLEEPOVER
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Welcome  back  to  fall  storytimes  and  programming.  One  easy  and  fun  way  to  target  those  
reluctant  readers  is  to  host  a  Stuffed  Animal  Sleepover.  Invite  your  young  readers  to  bring  
their  best,  stuffed  friend  to  the  library  for  a  special  storytime.  Then,  when  storytime  is  over,  
the stuffed animals stay behind for a special sleepover in the library! Take pictures of the stuffed 
animals  reading  in  the  stacks,  playing  in  the  reading  room,  and  maybe  getting  into  a  little  bit  
of  mischief  in  the  staff-only  areas.  Pictures  can  be  posted  throughout  the  night  on  your  
library’s  social  media  pages  or  displayed  the  next  day  at  pickup.  This  great  program  shows 
youngsters  that  reading  with  their  stuffed  animals  can  be  fun  and  encourages  them  to  read  
to their stuffed friends at home.

Tips from the experts:

•  “Check in” each stuffed animal and give it a name tag and list the owner. This way, you can 
avoid issues of duplicate animals or find lost owners that may forget to pick up their friend.

•  Put multiple animals in each photo and make sure that they all get equal camera time. 
•  Limit the number of sleepover attendees so that you are not overwhelmed with participants.
•  Get creative! Have teen volunteers or other staff members have fun with the photo setups.
•  Search the internet for fun ideas. Here and here are great places to start.

UNIVERSAL CLASS COURSE OF THE MONTH: 
GED TEST PREPARATION
Submitted by Angie Houser

This  is  one  of  the  longest  courses  offered  on  Universal 
Class,  but  it  is  designed  to  take  the  place  of  any  GED  
test preparation classes that a student would take. 

The course goes through each section of the GED test and 
gives exams and assignments for each one. Unfortunately, 
a student cannot skip around areas of the test depending 
on what they need to work on. Every lesson must be done in order. But when students are done with this 
course, they will be ready to take the GED test without any additional courses. 

This  course  is  comprised  of  50  lessons,  96  exams  and  assignments,  and  should  take  about  37  hours  
to complete.

All of this is available with a public or State Library card. Check out this course and more today!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & 
LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCE ANSWERS, CONTINUED 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This  is  the  twelfth  in  a  series  of  Flickertale  articles 
that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s 
legal reference resources.

Chapter  28-01  of  the  North  Dakota  Century 
Code  contains  many  of  North  Dakota’s  statute  of 
limitations laws.

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The Flickertale. 

Following  are  more  frequently  asked  questions 
by  self-represented  patrons  and  the  legal  research 
resource  answers  given  by  North  Dakota  Supreme 
Court  Law  Library  and  North  Dakota  Legal  Self  
Help Center staff.

I was served a civil summons and complaint, but 
there’s no case number and the Clerk of District 
Court says the case hasn’t been filed. Do I have to 
do what the summons says?

Civil  cases  in  North  Dakota  State  District  Court  
start  with  service  of  the  summons  and  complaint 
on the Defendant(s). Generally, filing is not required 
to  occur  before  the  summons  and  complaint  are 
served.  Filing  is  when  a  case  number  is  assigned  
by a Clerk of District Court.

So,  it  is  very  common  for  the  summons  and 
complaint  for  a  civil  case  to  be  served  without  a  
case  number  because  the  case  is  not  yet  filed  
with the District Court. 

Since  service  starts  the  civil  case,  the  deadline  for 
the  Defendant  to  answer  starts  to  run  when  they  
are served the summons and complaint.

Direct  the  patron  to  the  ND  Legal  Self  Help  
Center website and scroll to the District Court Civil 
section.  Click  on  the  ‘Answering  a  Summons  and 
Complaint’ link.

How long do I have to bring my case?

This  is  a  statute  of  limitations  question.  A  statute  
of  limitation  is  the  time  allowed  by  law  to  bring  a 
civil or criminal action to court.

Other  laws  besides  those  contained  in  Chapter  
28-01  may  apply.  Direct  the  patron  to  the  
printed General Index of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  The  Index  has  a  “Statute  of  Limitations”  
topic section.

The  patron  needs  to  determine  for  themselves  
which  statute  of 
limitations  applies  to  their 
circumstances,  or  will  need  to  consult  an  attorney 
for advice.

How do I change my name/name of my minor 
child?

Chapter  32-28  of  the  North  Dakota  Century  Code 
contains  the  requirements 
for  adult  and  minor  
name changes.

For  forms  and  instructions  for  changing  the  name  
of  an  adult  or  a  minor,  direct  the  patron  to  the  
ND  Legal  Self  Help  Center  website  and  scroll  to  the 
‘Name Changes’ section. 

My  relative  died  and  I  need  to  pay  the  funeral 
expenses  and  deal  with  their  estate.  What  do  
I do?

When  a  person  dies,  most  of  the  work  to  be  done 
with  the  estate  is  the  legal  and  orderly  transfer  
of  the  deceased  person’s  property  to  the  persons 
entitled to receive it (the creditors and heirs).

Title  30.1  of  the  North  Dakota  Century  Code  
contains 
laws  related  to  handling  a  deceased 
person’s estate. 

Direct the patron to the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website  and  scroll  to  the ‘Probate  section’.  Click  on  
all  three  links.  Each  link  has  information  about 
the  three  different  processes  to  transfer  probate 
property under Title 30.1.

How does my husband adopt my child?

A  stepparent  is  allowed  by  North  Dakota  law  to 
adopt  a  child.  Some  requirements  for  adopting 
a  minor  child  do  not  apply 
in  a  step-parent  
adoption of a minor child.

Direct  the  patron  to  the  ND  Legal  Self  Help  
Center  website  and  scroll  to  the  ‘Family  Law’  
section. Click on the Adoption link.

How do I get an annulment?

I bought a car, and I can’t get the title from the 
previous  owner. The  North  Dakota  Department 
of Transportation says I need a court order. How 
do I get it?

An  annulment  is  a  civil  court  process  to  declare 
If  a  North  
that  a  marriage  never  happened. 
Dakota  state  district  court  annuls  a  marriage,  
the marriage is void.

A  North  Dakota  state  district  court  can  annul  
a marriage only in limited situations.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
