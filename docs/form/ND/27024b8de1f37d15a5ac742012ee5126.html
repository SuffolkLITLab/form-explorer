school  programs  for  3rd-5th  or  6th-12th  grade  girls  
to  join  a  sisterhood  of  supportive  peers  and  role 
models  and  use  computer  science  to  change  the 
world.  You  can  lead  a  Club  at  a  flexible  time  and 
format  that  works  best  for  your  library  --  and  there 
is NO prior computer science experience needed to 
lead your Club!

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

I  recently  had  the  honor  to  provide  training 
to  Missouri  librarians  in  multiple  locations  on 
safety and security in the libraries. The workshop 
was broken out into active threat, policies and 
procedures, and creepy patrons. The discussion 
was robust with a fair bit of laughter thrown in 
for the last part of the workshop where librarians 
asked questions and shared stories about their 
challenging  patrons.  I  provided  examples  of  a 
few  creepy  patrons  to  kick  off  the  discussion. 
I  shared  that  a  few  years  ago  I  received  a 
question  from  a  North  Dakota  librarian  who 
was  wondering  if  a  patron  should  be  banned 
if they undressed in the library; the patron was 
a  regular  who  had  some  mental  health  issues 
and the librarian wanted to give them another 
chance  but  the  sheriff’s  office  felt  differently 
and issued a trespass order. I had no idea how 
many stories were going to be shared of naked, 
near naked, and partially-clothed patrons! There 
were  also  some  serious  questions  asked  and 
solutions shared for challenging patrons. 

We  discussed  various  policies  and  procedures 
that you want to have in place to protect both 
patrons  and  staff.  A  must-have  is  a  Patron 
Behavior  Policy.  I  am  a  fan  of  keeping  policies 
as simple as possible. We cannot possibly think 
of  and  address  every  possible  scenario  and 
challenge that will happen when working with 
the public. You want to draft policies that staff 
will  be  able  to  remember  and  implement  in 
the  heat  of  the  moment.  Your  policies  should 
be written for the majority of your patrons; you  
can  deal  with  the  exceptions  as  they  come.  
Don’t  be  afraid  to  address 
inappropriate 
behavior  because  it  is  not  specifically  spelled 
out in the policy. 

in  our 
Patrons  feel  a  sense  of  ownership 
libraries,  and  that  is  awesome.  We  cannot  let 
patrons  direct  what  behavior  is  acceptable 
in  our  libraries  however.  One  of  the  librarians 
shared that the final line in the libraries Patron  
Behavior Policy was something like “the library 
director  and  staff  have  the  right  to  maintain  
the  library’s  atmosphere  as  they  deem.”  The 
wording wasn’t quite that clunky, but hopefully, 
you get the idea. Basically, that  board-adopted 
library  staff  to  address 
policy  empowered 
behaviors  that  were  inappropriate  and  to  set 
the  expectations  to  maintain  a  comfortable,  
friendly  space  that  allowed  them  to  meet  the 
needs of all library patrons and users. 

The  Patron  Behavior  Policy  should 
include 
something  that  says  that  patrons  are  not  
allowed  to  disrupt  use  of  the  library  by  other 
patrons  or  staff. This  covers  a  whole  multitude 
issues  such  as  sleeping,  odor, 
of  patron 
drunkenness, naked (!), loud use of cellphones, 
running  to  name  a  few.  Our  policies  and 
procedures  should  set  the  tone  for  use  of  our 
space  and  should  empower  staff  to  meet  the 
needs  of  patrons  by  addressing  and  dealing 
with inappropriate behavior. 

Other  policies  that  were  discussed  included 
Unattended  Children,  Computer  Use,  Smelly 
Patron,  Service  Animals,  Active  Threat,  and 
Disaster  Planning.  You  can  find  samples  for 
many  of  these  on  our  website  but  please  feel 
free to reach out to Library Development or to 
me if you’d like feedback on policies or samples 
that aren’t on the website.

database,  you  can  take  a  variety  of  courses  in  dozens  of  subject  areas.  It  has  lessons  on  course  work  
found  in  school,  classes  that  can  help  with  discovering  a  hobby,  and  even  ones  that  can  teach  skills  to 
further a career. 

Each class will give you the pertinent information upfront, such as how long it will take to finish, how many 
lessons and exams there are, and how many continuing education units (CEUs) the course is worth. If you 
pass the course, you will receive a certificate that can be used to prove how many CEUs you have earned. 

You  also  have  the  option  to  take  most  of  these  courses  without  having  assignments  and  exams. 
This  would  be  through  watching  learning  videos.  When  enrolling  in  the  course,  it  will  ask  you  for

MAY 2019

By Jessica Robinson

If I had fifty pages this month, I still wouldn’t be able 
to write about all of the great science fiction titles of 
2019, so let’s quickly strap ourselves into this rocket 
ship and blast off.  

The  Hugo  nominees  were  announced  last  month, 
and it’s a great assortment. Mary Robinette Kowal’s 
The  Calculating  Stars  brings  catastrophic  climate 
change  to  1950’s Washington,  D.C.,  propelling  the 
nascent space program into a life-or-death industry. 
Record of a Spaceborn Few is the third novel in the 
Wayfarers  series  by  Becky  Chambers  and  deals  
with  a  small  group  of  humans  still  clinging  to  life 
in  the  Exodus  Fleet,  the  spaceships  that  brought 
them  to  their  new  homes  across  the  galaxy. Yoon 
Ha  Lee  is  up  for  Revenant  Gun,  the  third  and  final 
book in his The Machineries of Empire series, which 
deals with memory loss on a galactic scale when a 
teenage  boy  wakes  up  in  a  body  several  decades 
older  than  he  remembers  being,  with  a  tyrant  for 
a boss and an army of subordinates who hate him. 
Catherynne  M.  Valente’s  Space  Opera  has  been 
described as “Eurovision but in space,” and frankly, 
I  think  any  other  summary  pales  in  comparison. 
Naomi  Novik’s  Spinning Silver  is  firmly  fantasy,  but 
we’ll let it slide since this retelling of Rumpelstiltskin 
just  as  enjoyable  as  her  previous  Hugo  nominee 
Uprooted. Finally, Rebecca Roanhorse started a new 
urban fantasy series with Trail of Lightning, a book 
that  combines  a  watery  apocalypse  with  Navajo 
gods and monsters.    

Now,  let’s  leave  the  Hugos  until  the  winners  are 
announced later this year and turn our attention to 
some of recently released sci-fi of 2019. Mike Chen’s 
Here and Now and Then came out late January and 
tells  the  story  of  a  busy  family  man  in  the  21st 
century  who  also  happens  to  be  a  stranded  time-
traveler from 2142. The fantastically named Famous 
Men  Who  Never  Lived  by  K.  Chess  follows  a  group 
of  survivors  who  fled  their  doomed  reality  for  the 
relative  safety  of  our  own  and  experience  culture 
clash  on  an  epic  scale.  Martin  L.  Shoemaker’s 
Today  I  Am  Carey  explores  the  devastating  effects 

of  Alzheimer’s  through  the  lens  of  Carey,  an 
empathetic  android  brought  in  to  care  for  the 
matriarch  of  a  grieving  family.  A  Memory  Called 
Empire by Arkady Martine is the first in a new series 
called  Teixcalaan  and  deals  with  an  ambassador 
who is summoned from her small mining station to 
a vast multi-system empire as a replacement for a 
man who she suspects was murdered. Finally, mid-
April brought us a seafaring epic (but in space) with 
Winds  of  Marque:  Blackwood  Virtue  by  Bennett  R. 
Coles, centering around the worst in the King’s Navy 
as they take on a group of dangerous space pirates.

Finally,  we  update  our  reading  list  with  some 
upcoming  releases  for  2019.  First  up  is  The  Sol 
Majestic  by  Ferrett  Steinmetz,  a  comedic  quest 
that  follows  a  teen  guru  on  his  way  to  a  lavish 
free  meal  at  the  most  exclusive  and  expensive 
restaurant in the galaxy, now teetering on the edge 
of  bankruptcy.  Max  Gladstone’s  Empress of Forever 
takes  a  brilliant  young  innovator  from  our  time 
and flings her across time and space to the middle 
of  a  galactic  insurrection,  forcing  her  to  choose 
between  a  group  of  misfit  rebels  and  an  empress 
who  can  destroy  a  planet  with  a  thought.  The  
Lesson  by  Cadwell  Turnbull  takes  the  idea  of 
colonialism  in  the  Virgin  Islands  and  adds  aliens, 
creating  a  world  where  largely  benevolent  but 
militaristic  aliens  conduct  undisclosed  research 
above an anxious local population. Chuck Wendig 
is better known for his Star Wars books, but this July 
he unveils Wanderers, featuring an America plagued 
by  a  mysterious  epidemic  that  causes  people 
to  sleepwalk  towards  an  unknown  destination.  
Finally,  in  a  September  debut,  Annalee  Newitz’s 
The Future of Another Timeline takes contemporary 
America  and  adds  time  travel,  forcing  a  geologist 
named  Tess 
shadowy  
organization that wants to use it solely for their own 
personal gain.

stand  against  a 

to 

Next month, we’ll venture from the realm of science 
fiction  to  science  fact  when  we  look  at  the  most 
highly-anticipated non-fiction of 2019.

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR THE NORTH DAKOTA 
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This  is  the  eighth  in  a  series  of  Flickertale  articles  
that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s 
legal reference resources.

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The Flickertale. 

NUMBERING  SYSTEM 
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

(CITATIONS)  OF  THE 

The  Administrative  Code  has  a  numbering  system, 
also called the citation, to identify specific rules and 
regulations within the Code. 

Next month’s article will get into more detail about 
legal  research  resources  for  the  North  Dakota 
Attorney General Legal Opinions.  The North Dakota 
Attorney  General  is  allowed  by  state  law  to  give 
written legal opinions, within limitations.

WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE?

The Administrative Code is the rules and regulations 
enacted by many of North Dakota’s Executive Branch 
administrative agencies.

When the North Dakota State Legislative Assembly 
creates  an  administrative  agency,  the  statutes  that 
create the agency give the broad boundaries of what 
the agency can do.  The agency enacts regulations 
to pin down the specifics. The regulations of many 
state agencies form the North Dakota Administrative 
Code.

When enacting rules and regulations, administrative 
agencies must follow a rulemaking process.

The  rulemaking  process  for  many  agencies 
is 
in  the  Administrative  Agencies  Practices  Act,  or 
North  Dakota  Century  Code  Chapter  28-32.    The 
statutes that create the agency may have additional 
requirements the agency must follow.

Some  agencies  are  not  required  to  follow  North 
Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-32 and have their 
own  rulemaking  process  within  the  statutes  that 
create the agency.  The rules of these agencies are 
not required to be published in the Administrative 
Code.    However,  some  consent  to  have  their  rules 
published in the Administrative Code.

The citation is made up of four sets of numbers, each 
separated by a hyphen.

the agency is assigned an Article.

Title.  Each  administrative  agency  is  
assigned a Title.

First Set =  
 
Second Set =  Article.  Each  division  or  area  within  
 
Third Set =   Chapter.  Each  subject  area  within  a  
division  of  the  agency  is  assigned  a  
 
 
Chapter.
Fourth Set =   Section.  Each  rule 
 

section.  This is the text of the rule.

is  assigned  a  

For  example,  the  Administrative  Code  citation  for 
75-02-04.1-01 breaks down like this:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

is  assigned  to  the  North  Dakota  

Title  75 
Department of Human Resources (NDDHS).
Article  75-02  is  assigned  to  the  Economic  
Assistance division of NDDHS.
Chapter  75-02-04.1  is  assigned  to  the  Child  
Support Guidelines subject area of the Economic  
Assistance division of NDDHS.
Section 75-02-04.1-01 contains the text of the  
definitions  rule  within  the  Child  Support  
Guidelines Chapter.

Effective Date and History for Each Rule

A  History  section  immediately  follows  the  text  of 
each rule.

The  History  section 
lists  the  original  effective 
date  of  the  rule  and  the  date  of  any  subsequent 
amendments. The  current  version  is  effective  as  of 
the last date in the list.

General Authority for Each Rule

A General Authority section immediately follows the 
History section of the rule.

The  General  Authority  section  lists  the  statute  or 
statutes that authorize the agency to enact the rule.

Law Implemented for Each Rule

A  Law  Implemented  section  follows  the  General 
Authority section of the rule. 

MAY 2019

The  Law  Implemented  lists  the  specific  statute 
carried out, or implemented, by the rule. The specific 
statutes that are carried out, or implemented, may 
be  North  Dakota  state  statutes,  Federal  statutes  or 
regulations, or case law (court opinions).

WHERE  TO  FIND  PAST  VERSIONS  OF  THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE CODE

Sometimes  a  patron  wants  to  know  what  the 
administrative  rule  was  on  a  specific  date  or 
timeframe, or how the rule has changed over time.

Past  versions  of  the  Administrative  Code  are 
available on the North Dakota Legislative Council’s 
Administrative Code webpage. Look for the “To view 
Administrative Rules Supplements please click here” 
link directly above the Title listings.

The Administrative Rules Supplement webpage has 
past versions of the Administrative Code starting in 
July 1979.

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT: MESSY TIME!
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Looking  to  jazz  up  your  toddler  programming?  Consider  doing  a  completely  tactile  program  where 
toddlers and their caregivers are given freedom to explore and make a mess in your library (or outside). 
DIY sensory tables are easy enough to create with ziplock bags, plastic toys or foam shapes, hair gel, and 
packaging tape. Other fun and easy sensory experiences can be made by hiding small toys in beans, 
rice, crumpled up newspaper, or even dirt. Allow the kids to search for a toy or two and then put it into a 
separate bin. Create shaker eggs with plastic eggs and washi tape or let kids “paint” with water on top of 
construction paper. The object of messy/sensory time is to engage children in a tactile way. So any sort 
of squishy, soft, sticky, or otherwise visually interesting thing you can think of is fair game; the options  
are truly endless. Check out this link at the ALSC blog for more ideas: http://bit.ly/2GY54Rc
