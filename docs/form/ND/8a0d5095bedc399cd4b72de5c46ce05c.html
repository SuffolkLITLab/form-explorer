      <pre>Instructions for Requesting a Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order  

Important! Read Before Using This Packet of Forms. 

ND Legal Self Help staff and court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). If you’re 
unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

North Dakota Century Code § 12.1-31.2-01 allows a state's attorney to advise and assist any 
person in the preparation of documents necessary to secure a restraining order. Be aware 
there are limitations on the amount of assistance a state’s attorney may provide. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about 
finding a lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as 
a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.   

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover basic 
procedure for petitioning for a disorderly conduct restraining order. There’s no guarantee that

Who May Use this Packet? 

1.  An adult (18 years old or older) who is a victim of disorderly conduct; or 

2.  An adult who is the parent or guardian of a minor (under 18 years old) who is a victim of 

disorderly conduct. 

Overview of the Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order Process 

Step 1: Petition Filed. The Petitioner completes and files a petition with the North Dakota State 
District Court requesting a disorderly conduct restraining order. 

Step 2: Temporary Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order Issued. The Judge or Judicial Referee 
may issue a temporary disorderly conduct restraining order if the Judge or Judicial Referee finds 
that the petition alleges reasonable grounds to believe the Respondent engaged in disorderly 
conduct, based upon allegations of intrusive or unwanted acts, words, or gestures that are 
intended to adversely affect the safety, security, or privacy of Petitioner and/or individual to be 
protected. 

Step 3: Hearing Scheduled; Notice of Hearing Served: A hearing is scheduled on the petition for 
a disorderly conduct restraining order not later than fourteen (14) days after the Judge or 
Judicial Referee issues the temporary disorderly conduct restraining order. 

The Petitioner arranges for the Sheriff to serve the Respondent with the notice of the hearing 
and a copy of the petition. 

Step 4: Hearing Held. The hearing is held to decide whether the Judge or Judicial Referee will 
extend the temporary disorderly conduct restraining order and grant a disorderly conduct 
restraining order. At the hearing, the Petitioner must show evidence that the Respondent 
engaged in disorderly conduct. 

Step 5: Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant Disorderly Conduct Restraining 
Order. If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that the Petitioner proved there are reasonable 
grounds to believe the Respondent engaged in disorderly conduct, the Judge or Judicial Referee 
may grant a disorderly conduct restraining order against the Respondent. The disorderly 
conduct restraining order can’t last more than 2 years. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that the Petitioner didn’t show enough evidence that the 
Respondent engaged in disorderly conduct, or if the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that the 
Respondent engaged in a constitutionally protected activity, the case is dismissed.

You may be asked to pay an $80.00 filing fee. 

• 

If domestic violence is the reason you’re asking for a Disorderly Conduct Restraining 
Order, you won’t be charged a filing fee. Section 12.1-31.2-01(11) of the North Dakota 
Century Code doesn’t require victims of domestic violence to pay the filing fee. 

Verify with the Clerk of Court if you’re required to pay the filing fee. 

If you can’t afford the filing fee, complete the Fee Waiver Forms available on the ND Legal Self 
Help Center website at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the “Miscellaneous” section. 

Step 2 – The Judge or Judicial Referee May Issue a Temporary 
Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order. 

After your Petition is accepted for filing by the Clerk of Court, the Clerk of Court forwards your 
petition to the Judge or Judicial Referee for review. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee reviews your petition to determine if the information you 
included is enough to find there are reasonable grounds to believe the Respondent engaged in 
disorderly conduct. 

NDLSHC 

Page 6 of 8 

DCRO Instructions/Rev. Nov 2022 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds reasonable grounds to believe the Respondent engaged 
in disorderly conduct, the Judge or Judicial Referee signs a Temporary Disorderly Conduct 
Restraining Order. 

The Temporary Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order may order the following: 

•  The Respondent must stop or avoid the disorderly conduct. 
•  The Respondent must have no contact with the person requesting the order. 

The Temporary Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order may only be entered against the 
Respondent. 

The Temporary Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order is in effect until one of the following 
happens: 

•  The Judge or Judicial Referee grants a more permanent Disorderly Conduct Restraining 

Order after the hearing is held; 

•  The Judge or Judicial Referee ends the Temporary Order Disorderly Conduct Restraining 

Order before the hearing is held (usually with a new written order); or 

•  After the hearing, the Judge or Judicial Referee dismisses your case. 

Step 3 – The Hearing is Scheduled; Petitioner Arranges for the Sheriff 
to Serve the Temporary Order & Notice of Hearing on the 
Respondent. 

The District Court will schedule a time and date for the hearing on your Petition. The hearing 
will be scheduled within 14 days of the approval of the Temporary Disorderly Conduct 
Restraining Order. 

If service can’t be made on the Respondent, the court may set a new hearing date. 

The Petitioner must arrange for the sheriff to service copies of the following on the 
Respondent: 

•  The Notice of Hearing; and 
•  The Temporary Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order. 

o  The Notice of Hearing may be combined with the Temporary Order. 

Give the Sheriff the Respondent’s full name and current location. If you don’t know, make sure 
you give the Sheriff all of the information you know about the Respondent. If the Sheriff can’t 
find the Respondent, they may not be able to complete service. 

NDLSHC

DCRO Instructions/Rev. Nov 2022 

If the Respondent is a minor (less than 18 years old), the Respondent’s parents must also be 
served. In addition to the Respondent’s information, give the Sheriff the full names and current 
locations of the Respondent’s parents.  

Step 4 – Attend the Hearing. 

You must attend the hearing.  

At the hearing, you must prove the facts you included in your petition. 

If you have any witnesses to the facts you included in your Petition, you may bring the 
witnesses with you to the hearing.   

The hearing also gives the Respondent the opportunity to give their side of the story and 
present any witnesses to the facts you included in your Petition. 

At the hearing, the Judge or Judicial Referee will determine whether the Temporary Order 
should be extended and whether a Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order should be issued for a 
set period of time. The set period of time can’t be for more than two (2) years.   

Step 5 – The Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant the 
Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order. 

After the hearing is held, if the Judge or Judicial Referee determines there are reasonable 
grounds the Respondent committed disorderly conduct, the Judge or Judicial Referee signs a 
Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order. The Order can’t last more than 2 years. 

The Clerk of Court sends a copy of the Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order to the local law 
enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the residence of the victim. 

The Disorderly Conduct Restraining Order is served on the Respondent by the Sheriff. 

Report any violations of the Order immediately to local law enforcement. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides that you didn’t prove the facts you listed in your 
petition, the case is dismissed and the Temporary Order is no longer in effect.
