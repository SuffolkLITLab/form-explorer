      <pre>SERVICE INFORMATION AFTER A CIVIL ACTION HAS BEEN STARTED 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves 
in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided isn’t intended for 
legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov by clicking on the “Self 
Help” link. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

• 

If you’d like to learn more about finding a lawyer to represent you, go to 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer.  

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about the 
service after a civil action has started in a North Dakota State District Court.  The Center isn’t 
responsible for any consequences that may result from the information provided.  The information 
can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state of North Dakota. 

Use at your own risk. 

CAUTION! 
A self-represented individual may only represent themselves in a North Dakota state district 
court civil action. 

If a Plaintiff/Petitioner or Defendant/Respondent is an artificial person, such as a business, 
corporation or limited liability company, a non-attorney can’t represent the artificial person in 
a North Dakota state district court civil action.  Consult an attorney!

Rule 5 Service Info/Rev. Apr 2020 

Parties in a Civil Action 

For Civil Actions Starting with a Summons and Complaint: 

•  Plaintiff: The party who starts a civil action with service of a summons and complaint. 
•  Defendant: The party who is served with a summons and complaint requesting civil legal 

action against them. 

For Civil Actions Starting with a Summons and Petition: 

•  Petitioner: The party who starts a civil action with service of a summons and petition. 
•  Respondent: The party who is served with a summons and petition requesting civil legal 

action against them. 

Service is an important step in the legal process.  Everything filed with the court 
after a civil action has started must be served on the other parties in the action. 

Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the requirements for service of 
documents after a civil action has been started.  (Requirements for service to start a civil action 
are found in Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.) 

Generally, each of the following documents must be served under Rule 5 on every party, unless 
the rules, the laws that apply to your civil action, or the court provide otherwise: 

•  An order; 
•  A pleading served after the original summons and complaint (see Rule 7 of the North 

Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for types of documents that are pleadings); 

•  A discovery document required to be served on a party (see Rule 5(d)(3) of the North 
Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for discovery documents that are filed with the court); 

•  A written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; 
•  A written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of judgment, or any similar document; 

and; 

•  Every document filed with the clerk or submitted to the judge. 

Review the North Dakota laws and rules that apply to your civil action.  If a North Dakota law or 
rule tells the specific method of service that must be used, use that method of service. 

If the party is not represented by a lawyer, serve the party.  If the party is known to be 
represented by a lawyer, serve the lawyer instead of the party. 

***In general, copies of documents are served.  Original documents are filed with the court.***

Rule 5 Service Info/Rev. Apr 2020 

Proof of service tells the court how, when and where the parties were served 
and the documents that were served. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  If proof of service is not filed, the 
court won’t act on your documents. 

The proof of service for documents served after a civil action has been started tells the court 
when, how, and where the party or parties were served. 

•  A certificate of service gives the court proof of service when a sheriff or other officer 

served the document(s). 

•  An affidavit of service gives the court proof of service when a person other than a sheriff 

or other officer served the document(s). 

Affidavit of service forms are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-
action.  Forms aren’t available for every method of service under Rule 5. 

Self-Represented parties aren’t required to serve documents electronically. 

Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure requires electronic service of documents.   

Self-represented parties are exempt from this requirement.  (See Rule 3.5 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court.) 

You must locate the addresses of the parties for service. 

Following are examples of ways to find people for service:  

•  Last known address. 

o  Contact the U.S. Post Office for information on forwarding addresses. 

•  Friends, family, employers. 
•  Online search engines. 
•  Government entities, such as Department of Motor Vehicles or County Recorder. 
•  North Dakota business entity search, available at the ND Secretary of State website. 
•  Social Security Death Index. 
•  Utility companies. 
•  Social networking websites. 
•  Reverse directories. 

o  A reverse directory allows someone to search by phone number to find an 
address.  (Your local library may have access to reverse directories.)
