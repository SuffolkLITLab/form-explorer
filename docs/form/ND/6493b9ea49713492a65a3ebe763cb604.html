 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

check  in  on  patrons.  Libraries  across  North 
Dakota  are  offering  curbside  services,  books  
take-n-make  craft  
by  delivery  and  mail, 
programs,  holds  pickup  via  lockers,  and  many 
other  creative  ways  to  get  books  and  other  
library materials into people’s hands.

ibraries  have  always  been  masterful  at  
adapting  their  services,  programs,  and  library 
collections  to  meet  the  needs  of  their  patrons 
and  the  larger  community.  We  need  to  think  
now  about  what  we  need  to  do  to  meet  
those  needs  to  the  best  of  our  ability  while 
adapting  to  our  new  normal,  whatever  that  
may  end  up  looking  like.  I  don’t  think  we  
really  know  what  the  world  will  look  like  and  
how 
it  will  function  on  the  other  side  of  
this  pandemic,  and  I  think  we’re  still  a  long  
way 
from  knowing.  Know  that  the  State  
Library  is  here  to  serve  your  needs  and  to  
assist  you  as  you  work 
these  
challenging  times  and  make  changes  to  serve 
your community.

through 

hen  we  are  able  to  travel  once  again,  I  
love  to  connect  with  you  at  your  
would 
library.  We  are  going  to  be  changing  up  our 
Librarian  for  a  Day  program  a  little  bit  and  
reaching  out  to  libraries  to  schedule  visits,  
but  you  are  always  welcome  to  invite  me  to  
your  library  for  any  celebration  or  occasion.  
I  love  visiting  the  libraries  across  North  Dakota 
and  look  forward  to  the  day  that  I  can  once  
again  do  so  more  easily.  Until  that  day,  please 
connect  with  me  via  email,  phone,  or  find  me  
on social media.

  L

  W

We  are  all  trying  to  find  different  ways  to  
make  or  strengthen  connections  these  days.  
There  are  so  many  different  opportunities  to 
connect  with  people,  whether 
it’s  through  
social  media,  online  meetings,  phone  calls,  or 
letters.  People  are  sending  cards  and  letters  
through  snail  mail  now  at  a  much  higher  rate  
than  in  the  past  few  years,  if  not  longer.  A  
neat  idea  I  read  about  recently  was  to  trace  
large  piece  of  paper  and  
your  arms  on  a 
send  the  “hug”  to  someone  that  you  can’t  
hug  in  person  right  now.  I  absolutely  love  
this idea.

here  are  a  number  of  ways  that  librarians 
are  connecting  to  other  librarians  now.  The 
State  Library  is  hosting  weekly  meetings  for  
all  members  of  the  North  Dakota  Library 
Community  on  alternating  Tuesdays  and 
Thursdays.  It  is  a  great  opportunity  to  ask  
questions,  share  successes  and  challenges,  and 
just  see  people.  The  Mountain  Plains  Library 
Association  will  be  hosting  monthly  Member 
Chats  on  the  fourth  Wednesday  of  the  month. 
These  chats  will  start  on  July  22  and  are  open 
to  anyone.  E-mail  memberships@mpla.us  for 
more  information.  If  you  are  a  member  of 
the  Association  of  Rural  and  Small  Libraries,  I 
recommend  joining  their  weekly  Town  Halls  if 
you  can  as  there  is  so  much  good  information 
shared at them.

  am  continually  impressed  by  all  of  the  ways 
that 
libraries  are  finding  to  connect  with 
their  communities  -  Everything  from  virtual 
programs  to  dial-a-story  to  phone  calls  to

Interlibrary Loan Update

As  of  July  6th,  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  fully  resumed  all  Interlibrary  Loan  activities.  
With  many  libraries  still  closed,  the  process  may  have  some  delays,  but  we  appreciate  your  
continued patience as we all figure out our “new normal.” 

If you have any questions, please feel free to call 328-4622 or e-mail statelib@nd.gov.

Library Storytime Programming Stem Kits

The State Library is in the process of adding several Fairy Tale and Folk Tale Problem-Solving 
Stem  Kits  to  KitKeeper.  Due  to  the  ever-changing  landscape  of  COVID-19,  we  are  not  sure 
when they will be released for check out and reservation.

The  Three  Billy  Goats  Gruff,  The  Three  Little  Pigs,  Goldilocks  &  the  Three  Bears,  Rapunzel, 
Little  Red  Riding,  and  The  Gingerbread  Man,  are  recommended 
for  ages  3-6  or  
preschool-1st  grade.  These  Fairy  Tale  STEM  kits  include  a  story  card  that  presents  a  
problem  for  kids  to  solve.  Children  are  encouraged  to  plan,  create  and  test  solutions.  
Building materials, a guide, plus student and teacher cards with lesson plans are included.

The  two  Folk  Tale  STEM  kits,  Johnny  Appleseed  and  Paul  Bunyan,  are  recommended  for  
ages  7-8  or  2nd-3rd  grade.  These  kits  come  with  a  STEM-focused  story  card,  student  
challenge cards, a detailed lesson plan and a reproducible design sheet.

All  kits  come  with  a  hard-cover  book. We  have  also  included  at  least  one  of  the  following  
with each of the Fairy Tale STEM kits: puppets, story wands, and/or mood & emotion mirrors.

The  final  kit  is  a  Castle  kit.  The  set  includes  60  enchanting,  hardwood  blocks  to  create  
a  fascinating  fortress  and  a  spacious  palace.  We  have  included  Everything  Castles,  a  
National  Geographic  Kids  book  and  a  set  of  story  wands  to  encourage  imaginative  
storytelling and writing.

These  kits  develop  skills  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  arts,  and  mathematics.  We  
are excited to begin sharing them with you.

Public Library Infographics

The  North  Dakota  State  Library  is  happy  to  provide  a  basic  infographic  based  on  the  
numbers  you  submitted  for  the  Public  Library  Survey  Annual  Report.  These  infographics  will  
include  the  number  of  visits  to  your 
items,  wireless  sessions,  
programs, program attendees, and circulations.

New PAC COVID-19 Procedures 

When  the  majority  of  libraries  closed  down  because  of  COVID-19  quarantines,  the  Online  Dakota  
Information	 Network	 (ODIN)	 had	 to	 make	 some	 adjustments	 with	 the	 online	 catalog.	 The	 North	 
Dakota State Library chose to remain active since we mail most of our materials out. Now, more libraries 
are	coming	back	and	more	materials	are	available	through	the	Public	Access	Catalog	(PAC).	However,	since	
some libraries are still closed, some of our patrons and libraries we serve have discovered that there is no 
way of actually requesting materials. 

The  Place  Request  and  
One-Click  Request  buttons 
are not available

Fortunately, there is an easy solution to this issue.  

This is the typical screen you are seeing when you first access 
the PAC.

Instead  of  logging  into  the  ODIN  Search  Screen,  use  the  
Library drop down and select North Dakota State Library.

By  selecting  the  North  Dakota  State  Library,  Polaris  knows  
you are using a catalog from a library that is open.  

Log  on  using  your  NDSL  barcode  and  password,  and  begin  searching.  You  can  search  the  State  
Library’s  PAC  page  or  go  back  to  the  ODIN  search.  Once  you  log  in  through  the  North  Dakota  State  
Library page, the Place Request and One-Click Request buttons will display.

The  Place  Request  and  
One-Click  Request  buttons 
are available

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to contact us at 1-800-472-2104 or at statelib@nd.gov.

New NASA@ My Library Kits

JULY 2020

The  North  Dakota  State  Library  will  soon  be  adding  two  more  STEM  kits  as  part  of  the  NASA@  My  
Library program. 

Expedition:  Earth  focuses  on  Earth  Science  and  includes  activities  that  are 
based  on  weather  and  magnification.  Major  content  areas  in  this  kit  include 
observing  clouds,  estimating  cloud  cover,  creating  wind  streamers,  collecting  
and  examining  specimens,  comparing  and  documenting  observations  of  
the  natural  world,  noticing  how  technology  can  change  perception,  and  
learning about perspectives. This kit includes two microscopes.

focuses  on  engineering  and  mathematics.  
The  Way  the  World  Works 
Major  content  areas  in  this  kit  include  the  following:  measuring  objects; 
learning  about  distance 
in  the  Solar  System;  multiplication;  creating  a  
plan  for  a  community  park;  designing  and  creating  a  bridge;  figuring  out 
how  high  people  can  jump  on  another  planet;  and  how  to  design  and  
build a shock-absorbing system.

There  are  enough  components  included  in  each  kit  to  accommodate  up  to  15  individuals/groups.  
The	 consumable	 items	 (straws,	 activity	 sheets,	 crepe	 paper,	 paper	 plates,	 construction	 paper,	 etc.)	 are	 
not expected to be returned. Many of the activities in these kits can be done as a grab-and-go program. 

These  two  new  kits  join  our  first  two  NASA@  My  Library  kits:  Sun-Earth-Moon  Connections  and  Be  A  
NASA Detective.

More  information  about  the  NASA@  My  Library  kits  and  other  STEM  kits  that  will  be  available  for  
check out soon can be found on our STEM Kit LibGuide.

If you have any questions about the kits, please send an e-mail to ndslpa@nd.gov or call 701-328-4656.

Ancestry Library Edition

JULY 2020

For  those  of  you  who  have  wanted  to  give  Ancestry.com  a  try,  
but  don’t  want  to  get  roped  into  a  contract,  we  have  a  solution  
for  you!  The  North  Dakota  State  Library  subscribes  to  Ancestry 
Library  Edition,  and  it  is  currently  completely  free  to  use  at  
home.  Generally,  this  database  is  only  available  in  the  library  
building,  but  they  have  opened  it  up  to  the  public  to  use  from  
home. All you need to access it is the link and your library card. 

Ancestry  Library  Edition  offers  the  same  results  that  the  
subscription  to  Ancestry.com  does,  including  valuable  hints  to  
help  you  through  your  genealogical  research.  However,  there  are  
  few  minor  differences  -  you  cannot  create  an  Ancestry  account  through  Library  Edition  or  link  an  
existing  Ancestry  account.  Therefore,  you  will  not  be  able  to  build  your  family  tree  on  this  side  of  
the  site  like  you  would  be  able  to  with  a  subscription.  If  you  have  an  Ancestry  account,  you  can  
add  to  your  family  tree  without  having  an  active  subscription.  So,  when  you  find  that  great  piece  of  
the  puzzle,  you  can  either  print  off  the  page  or  email  it  to  yourself  and  add  it  to  your  family  tree  later.  
Ancestry  Library  Edition  incorporates  forms  that  you  can  print  off  and  fill  in  to  keep  your  information  
organized, and forums to help you when you really get stuck. 

  a

ncestry  Library  Edition  is  available  at  home  for  a  limited  time,  so  make  sure  to  take  advantage  of  it  

f  you  have  any  questions  about  this  database  or  any  others  that  we  subscribe  to,  please  feel  free  to

Programming Spotlight: Maker Club

Since  Summer  Reading  Programs  are  looking  a  bit  different  this  year,  consider  bringing  some  
old  programs  back  with  a  twist.  Many  adults  and  children  alike  are  spending  more  time  on  
screens  than  ever,  both  for  work  and  play.  So  why  not  give  them  a  break  from  the  library’s  
Facebook feed and instead direct them to participate in a family activity?

ibrary LEGO clubs are a popular program because they allow kids to create among each other—
usually  with  a  common  theme  and,  in  many  libraries,  parents  or  caregivers  get  included  in  that  
joy  either  by  assisting  their  child  or  making  creations  of  their  own.  Despite  what  you  may  think,  
LEGO club doesn’t have to stop just because the library is closed.

onsider  sending  small  bags  of  LEGOs  home  with  families  or  doing  a  call  for  LEGOs  to  the  
community  for  a  giveaway.  Once  students  have  LEGOs  at  home,  post  a  weekly  theme  for  the  
club, and showcase the final projects on a “show and tell” page of the library’s website. 

f  LEGOs  seem  too  limiting,  branch  out  and  embrace  a  Maker  Club  by  encouraging  young  
makers	to	get	creative	by	using	anything	they	can	find	around	their	house	to	build	(paper	plates,	 
pens,	 cardboard	 boxes)	 to	 enhance	 their	 design.	 If	 students	 want	 to	 draw	 their	 creation	 instead	 
of	building	it—great!	If	they	want	to	make	a	completely	edible	design—also	great	(and	delicious)!	
Embrace  this  time  to  encourage  imagination  and  creativity  with  what  your  patrons  may  have  
laying around their homes.

JULY 2020

Last  month’s  Flickertale  article  about  online  storytime  ended  with  a  suggestion  to  look  over  your  library’s  
children’s  collection  for  great  books  to  use  as  you  move  online.  Kathy  MacMillan  has  shared  the  following 
recommendations, keeping in mind that books with large, bold, clear illustrations work best: 25 Recommended 
Picture Books for Online Storytimes.

Breaking into Online Storytime
Part Two- The “Technical Stuff”

Taking  your  storytimes  online  can  happen  in  one  of  two  ways:  live  or  recorded.  There  are  some  
obvious  advantages  to  recorded  storytimes:  mistakes  can  be  removed,  captions  are  more  easily  
created,  and  storytimes  are  more  widely  available.  On  the  other  hand,  live  storytimes  also  have  
advantages:  interaction  in  real  time,  a  heightened  sense  of  event  and  community,  and  an  added  
spontaneity.  Is  one  better  than  the  other?  Live  storytimes  can  be  recorded  and  be  made  available  to  
fit  patrons’  schedules,  but  ultimately  the  decision  is  one  you  have  to  make  based  on  your  community’s  
needs.  Online  storytimes,  live  or  recorded,  are  better  than  none.  In  order  to  be  less  intimidated  by  
the process, here are some tips.

Technical Tidbits

•	 Desktop  computers,  laptops,  tablets,  and  phones  can  all  be  used  to  do  live  or  recorded  storytimes.  
A  webcam  may  be  needed,  especially  when  using  a  desktop  computer.  When  using  a  phone,  
make sure it has a good camera.

•	 Use landscape orientation, not portrait.

•	 Using a microphone or headset will improve the sound quality and also improves automatic captioning.

•	 Make sure your background or backdrop is not too busy. 

•	 Use your library logo. This is your chance to promote your library.

•	 Avoid backlighting. Light from above or the side works much better.

•	 Don’t sit too far back from the camera.

•	 Make  sure  your  clothing  contrasts  from  your  skin  color,  but  avoid  busy  patterns,  low  necklines,  
dragging  sleeves,  or  other  wardrobe  issues  that  may  hinder  your  mobility  or  detract  from  the  focal 
point—the story.

•	 Set  up  materials  so  they  are  within  easy  reach.  Place  the  materials  in  the  order  you  will  use  them.  

You may need two copies of the book or text that is printed out. 

•	 Do a trial run. Rehearse and rehearse again until you have thought through the process and refined it.

•	 Realize  that  devices  and  platforms  work  differently.  Enlist  help  and  suggestions  from  seasoned  

storytime tellers that have used the devices and platforms you plan to use.  

•	 Keep  in  mind  that  online  storytimes  are  not  necessarily  accessible  to  everyone. What  can  you  do  to  

reach the hearing impaired, for example?

Course of the Month: Creating WordPress Websites

WordPress  is  one  of  the  most  common  places  out  there  
to  begin  creating  a  free  website.  It  makes  it  easy  to  start  
one  without  any  coding  experience  at  all.  WordPress  
not  only  has  easy  to  use  features  that  are  available  for  
free,  but  it  also  has  features  for  those  with  more  coding 
experience to explore. 

Universal  Class  offers  a  course  that  will  go  over  all  of  this.  The  course  is  set  up  to  help  those  with  no  
experience  understand  how  WordPress  works  and  how  to  set  up  a  website  through  them.  Some  of  
the  lessons  include  not  just  setting  up  a  website  but  also  exploring  graphics  and  images  for  it, 
planning  a  layout,  exploring  themes,  and  even  an  introduction  to  HTML.  This  course  will  take  you  
from knowing nothing about WordPress to setting up and maintaining your own website. 

The  course  is  comprised  of  13  lessons,  28  exams  and  assignments,  and  should  take  about  5  hours  
to complete.

If you have any questions, please e-mail us at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

YouTube Video Of The Month: 
Getting Started with Beanstack: How to Log your Reading

Last  month  we  went  over  how  to  set  up  an  account  with  
the State Library’s new summer reading database Beanstack. 
This  month,  we  wanted  to  highlight  the  video  that  will  
walk  you  through  how  to  log  your  reading  and  activities  
using  Beanstack. This  video  will  go  over  how  to  log  reading  
for  different  family  members  and  how  to  accomplish  
badges  for  the  reading  challenge.  Once  you  have  earned  
all  of  the  badges,  you  have  completed  the  challenge.  You  
can  log  reading  either  through  the  browser  like  you  see  in  
the video or through the app.

Do  you  shy  away  from  conflict?  In  organizations  across  the  world,  conflict  is  avoided.  Expectations  go  
unmet,  values  are  violated,  and  overall  under-performance  exists  because  people  do  not  know  how  to 
effectively resolve issues without resorting to the use of power. This one-hour session introduces you to 
concepts that enable you to begin to “integrate conflict”—to walk into it and effectively handle it—rather 
than avoid it.

Opportunity  often  hides  behind  adversity.  As  libraries  look  to  a  future  of  post-pandemic  challenges,  
from  looming  budget  cuts  to  increasingly  urgent  community  needs,  David  Lankes,  in  The  “New  
Normal”  Agenda  for  Librarianship,  encourages  us  to  consider  framing  the  positive  opportunities,  rather 
than  loss,  in  the  changes  that  lie  ahead.  If  we  are  intentional,  we  can  use  these  circumstances  to  grow  
our  organizations  and  to  address  the  digital  access  disparities  in  small  and  rural  communities.  This 
presentation  will  explore  how  one  rural  library  has  improved  internet  access  in  partnership  with  an 
internet service provider, hosted telehealth appointments in collaboration with healthcare providers and 
transportation  agencies,  worked  with  schools  to  ensure  opportunities  for  youth  through  esports,  and 
improved digital literacy skills for patrons and local businesses.

As  the  2020  election  quickly  approaches,  it  promises  to  be  the  most-watched  election  in  our  lifetime 
and  is  only  complicated  by  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  This  presentation  will  equip  library  staff  to  gather 
user-friendly  information  from  reliable  and  nonpartisan  sources  in  order  to  offer  an  invaluable,  
evolving online voting guide tailor-made for their communities.

By  exploring  resources—everything  from  a  glossary  of  common  terms  used  during  elections  to  
information  on  changing  voting  laws  and  options  due  to  the  pandemic—this  webinar  will  illustrate  
how libraries can gather the most useful information in order to address their community’s needs. With  
a focus on citizenship and voting, attendees will learn to serve their diverse populations in a welcoming  
and nonpartisan way.

Legal Research Resources for Formal Probate of an Estate 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

Asking  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  
appoint  a  personal  representative  for  a  deceased 
person’s  estate  is  a  frequently  requested  legal 
research  topic  by  self-represented  patrons  of  
the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library  
and North Dakota Legal Self Help Center.

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources 
in  North  Dakota  for  formal  probate  of  an  estate  
in North Dakota state district court.

DEFINITIONS IN AN FORMAL PROBATE CASE

Estate  –  All  of  the  property  a  deceased  person 
owned  or  had  an  interest  in  on  the  date  of  
their death.

Property  –  All  real  and  personal  property  of  
the  deceased  person.  Real  property  is  land  and  
things  attached  to  the  land,  such  as  buildings. 
Personal  property 
isn’t  real  
property,  such  as  money,  stocks,  vehicles,  and 
furniture.

is  everything  that 

person’s 

in  a  
Non-Probate  Property  –  The  property 
deceased 
transfers  
automatically  upon  their  death.  For  example,  a  
life  insurance  policy  that  transfers  to  a  named 
individual after providing a death certificate.

estate 

that 

Probate  Property  –  The  property  in  a  deceased 
person’s  estate  that  doesn’t  automatically  transfer 
upon  their  death.  The  transfer  of  property 
is 
determined  by  the  deceased  person’s  will,  or  by 
intestate succession.

Will  –  A 
legal  document  detailing  a  person’s  
wishes  for  transferring  ownership  of  the  property  
of their estate after death.

Intestate  Succession  –  When  a  person  dies  
without  a  will,  North  Dakota’s  intestate  succession 
laws  determine  to  who  receives  the  deceased 
person’s  property.  These  laws  also  apply  if  the 
include  all  of  
deceased  person’s  will  doesn’t 
the property.

Heir  –  The  person  entitled  to  the  deceased  
person’s  property  according  to  the  deceased 
person’s  will,  or,  if  there  is  no  will,  by  North  
Dakota’s intestate succession laws.

Personal  Representative  –  A  person  appointed 
by  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  settle  
and  distribute  the  estate  of  a  deceased  person. 
North  Dakota  law  includes  a  list  of  persons  who  
may  be  appointed  personal  representative 
in  
order of priority. 

WHAT IS AN FORMAL PROBATE CASE?

When  a  person  dies,  most  of  the  work  to  be  
done  with  the  estate  is  the  legal  and  orderly  
transfer  of  the  deceased  person’s  property  to  the 
persons	 entitled	 to	 receive	 it	 (the	 creditors	 and	 
heirs).	 When	 a	 deceased	 person	 has	 probate	
property that needs to be transferred, the property 
is transferred as part of a probate case.

A  personal  representative  is  appointed  by  the  
North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  settle  and  
transfer  the  probate  property  of  the  deceased 
person.

There  are  two  types  of  probate  cases  to  appoint 
a  personal  representative  –  formal  probate  and 
informal probate.

Formal  probate  cases  are  designed  for  increased 
supervision  of  the  personal  representative  by 
the  North  Dakota  state  district  court.  In-person  
hearings  are  a  required  part  of  the 
formal  
probate process.

Formal probate is required when:

•	 The validity of a will needs to be determined;
•	 There  are  objections  to  using  the  informal 

•	 When more than 3 years have passed since the 

probate process; or 

date of death.

If  a  request  for  formal  probate  is  received  after  
a  personal  representative  has  been  appointed  
as  part  of  an  informal  probate  case,  the  district  
court  may  decide  the  case  must  continue  as  a  
formal probate case.
