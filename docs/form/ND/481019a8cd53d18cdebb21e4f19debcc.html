FORMAL TESTACY AND APPOINTMENT PROCEEDINGS

30.1-15-01. (3-401) Formal testacy proceedings - Nature - When commenced.
1.

A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid 
will. A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a 
petition  as  described  in subsection 1  of  section  30.1-15-02 in  which the interested 
person requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a 
will,   or   a   petition   to   set   aside   an   informal   probate   of   a   will   or   to   prevent   informal 
probate   of   a   will   which   is   the   subject   of   a   pending   application,   or   a   petition   in 
accordance with subsection 2 of section 30.1-15-02 for an order that the decedent 
died intestate.
A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a 
conflicting  will   has  been  informally probated.  A formal   testacy  proceeding  may,  but 
need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.

2.

3. During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the court shall not act upon any 
application   for   informal   probate   of   any   will   of   the   decedent   or   any   application   for 
informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.

4. Unless   a   petition   in   a   formal   testacy  proceeding   also   requests   confirmation   of   the 
previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after 
receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain 
from exercising the power  to make any further distribution of the estate during the 
pendency   of   the   formal   proceeding.  A  petitioner   who   seeks   the   appointment   of   a 
different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order 
restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of that 
office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a 
request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no 
effect   on   the   powers   and   duties   of   a   previously  appointed   personal   representative 
other than those relating to distribution.

30.1-15-02. (3-402) Formal testacy or appointment proceedings - Petition - Contents.
1.

Petitions for formal probate of a will, or for adjudication of intestacy with or without 
request for appointment of a personal representative, must be directed to the court, 
request a judicial order after notice and hearing, and contain further statements as 
indicated in this section. A petition for formal probate of a will:
a. Requests an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular 
instrument which may or may not have been informally probated and determining 
the heirs.

b. Contains   the   statements   required   for   informal   applications   as   stated   in 
paragraphs 1 through 6 of  subdivision a of subsection 1  of  section 30.1-14-01 
and   the   statements   required   by   paragraphs 2   and   3   of   subdivision b   of 
subsection 1 of section 30.1-14-01.
States whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of 
the court or accompanies the petition.

c.

If the original will is neither in the possession of the court nor accompanies the petition 
and no authenticated copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the 
petition, the petition also must state the contents of the will, and indicate that it is lost, 
destroyed, or otherwise unavailable.
A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of an administrator in intestacy 
must request a judicial finding and order that the decedent left no will and determining 
the heirs, contain the statements required by subdivisions a and d of subsection 1 of 
section   30.1-14-01,   and   indicate   whether   supervised   administration   is   sought.   A 
petition may request an order determining intestacy and heirs without requesting the 
appointment of an administrator, in which case the statements required by paragraph 2 
of subdivision d of subsection 1 of section 30.1-14-01 may be omitted.

30.1-15-03. (3-403) Formal testacy proceeding - Notice of hearing on petition.
1. Upon commencement of a formal testacy proceeding, the court shall fix a time and 
place of hearing. Notice shall be given in the manner prescribed by section 30.1-03-01 
by the petitioner to the persons herein enumerated and to any additional person who 
has filed a demand for notice under section 30.1-13-04. Notice shall be given to the 
following persons:
a.
b.

The surviving spouse, children, and other heirs of the decedent;
The   devisees   and   executors   named   in   any   will   that   is   being,   or   has   been, 
probated, or offered for informal or formal probate in the county, or that is known 
by the petitioner to have been probated, or offered for informal or formal probate 
elsewhere; and
Any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been 
terminated.

c.

2.

Notice may be given to other persons. In addition, the petitioner shall give notice by 
publication to all unknown persons and to all known persons whose addresses are 
unknown who have any interest in the matters being litigated.
If   it   appears   by   the   petition   or   otherwise   that   the   fact   of   the   death   of   the   alleged 
decedent may be in doubt, or on the written demand of any interested person, a copy 
of the notice of the hearing on said petition shall be sent by registered mail to the 
alleged decedent at the alleged decedent's last-known address. The court shall direct 
the   petitioner   to   report   the   results   of,   or   make   and   report   back   concerning,   a 
reasonably diligent  search for the alleged decedent in any manner  that  may seem 
advisable, including any or all of the following methods:
a.

By inserting in one or more suitable periodicals a notice requesting information 
from any person having knowledge of the whereabouts of the alleged decedent.
By notifying law enforcement officials and public welfare agencies in appropriate 
locations of the disappearance of the alleged decedent.
By engaging the services of an investigator.

c.
The   costs   of   any  search   so   directed   shall   be   paid   by  the   petitioner   if   there   is   no 
administration or by the estate of the decedent in case there is administration.

b.

30.1-15-04.   (3-404)   Formal   testacy   proceedings  -  Written   objections   to   probate  - 

Demand for jury trial.

Any party to a formal proceeding who opposes the probate of a will for any reason shall 
state in that party's pleadings the objections to probate of the will. In a contested formal testacy 
proceeding, any party is entitled to a jury trial of all issues of fact by serving upon all appropriate 
parties and filing with the court a written demand for jury trial. The written demand must be 
affixed to the pleading of the party which raises any issues of fact and may not be served and 
filed later than seven days before the time set for hearing.

30.1-15-05. (3-405) Formal testacy proceedings  -  Uncontested cases  -  Hearings and 

If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy 
on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 30.1-15-09 have been 
met, or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support 
the   order   sought.   If   evidence   concerning   execution   of   the   will   is   necessary,   the   affidavit   or 
testimony of  one of any attesting witnesses to  the instrument is sufficient. If the affidavit or 
testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other 
evidence or affidavit.

30.1-15-06. (3-406) Formal testacy proceedings - Contested cases.
In a contested case in which the proper execution of a will is at issue, the following rules 

If   the   will   is   self-proved   pursuant   to   section   30.1-08-04,   the   will   complies   with   the 
requirements for execution without the testimony of any attesting witness, upon filing 

proof.

the will and the acknowledgment and affidavits annexed or attached to it, unless there 
is evidence of fraud or forgery affecting the acknowledgment or affidavit.
If   the   will   is   notarized   pursuant   to   paragraph 2   of   subdivision c   of   subsection 1   of 
section 30.1-08-02, but not self-proved, there is a rebuttable presumption that the will 
complies with the requirements for execution upon filing the will.
If   the  will   is   witnessed   pursuant   to   paragraph 1  of   subdivision c  of   subsection 1  of 
section 30.1-08-02, but not notarized or self-proved, the testimony of at least one of 
the attesting witnesses is required to establish proper execution if the witness is within 
this  state,   competent,   and   able   to   testify.   Proper   execution   may  be   established   by 
other evidence, including an affidavit of an attesting witness. An attestation clause that 
is signed by the attesting witnesses raises a rebuttable presumption that the events 
recited in the clause occurred.

30.1-15-07. (3-407) Formal testacy proceedings - Burdens in contested cases.
In   contested   cases,   petitioners   who   seek   to   establish   intestacy   have   the   burden   of 
establishing   prima  facie   proof   of   death,   venue,   and   heirship.   Proponents   of   a   will   have   the 
burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases, and, if they are also 
petitioners,  prima  facie  proof  of  death  and  venue.  Contestants  of  a will  have the burden  of 
establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, 
revocation, or other cause affecting its validity. Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion 
as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. If a will is opposed by 
the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the 
later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, 
it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

30.1-15-08.   (3-408)   Formal   testacy  proceedings  -  Will   construction  -  Effect   of   final 

order in another jurisdiction.

A final order of a court of another state determining testacy, the validity or construction of a 
will, made in a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for contest by all interested 
persons must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this state if it includes, or is based 
upon, a finding that the decedent was domiciled at the time of death in the state where the order 
was made.

30.1-15-09. (3-409) Formal testacy proceedings - Order - Foreign will.
After   the   time   required   for   any  notice   has   expired,   upon   proof   of   notice,   and   after   any 
hearing that may be necessary, if the court finds that the testator is dead, venue is proper, and 
that the proceeding was commenced within the limitation prescribed in section 30.1-12-08, it 
shall determine the decedent's domicile at death, the decedent's heirs, and the decedent's state 
of testacy. Any will found to be valid and unrevoked shall be formally probated. Termination of 
any previous informal appointment of a personal representative, which may be appropriate in 
view of the relief requested and findings, is governed by section 30.1-17-12. The petition shall 
be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is not satisfied that the alleged 
decedent is dead. A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death 
may be proved for probate in this state by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian 
that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of 
the other place.

30.1-15-10.   (3-410)   Formal   testacy   proceedings  -  Probate   of   more   than   one 

instrument.

If two or more instruments are offered for probate before a final order is entered in a formal 
testacy proceeding, more than one instrument may be probated if neither expressly revokes the 
other   or   contains   provisions   which   work   a  total   revocation   by  implication.   If   more  than   one 
instrument   is   probated,   the   order   shall   indicate   what   provisions   control   in   respect   to   the 
nomination of an executor, if any. The order may, but need not, indicate how any provisions of a 
particular   instrument   are   affected   by   the   other   instrument.  After   a   final   order   in   a   testacy 

Page No. 3

proceeding has been entered, no petition for probate of any other instrument of the decedent 
may be entertained, except incident to a petition to vacate or modify a previous probate order 
and subject to the time limits of section 30.1-15-12.

30.1-15-11. (3-411) Formal testacy proceedings - Partial intestacy.
If it becomes evident in the course of a formal testacy proceeding that, though one or more 
instruments are entitled to be probated, the decedent's estate is or may be partially intestate, 
the court shall enter an order to that effect.

30.1-15-12. (3-412) Formal testacy proceedings - Effect of order - Vacation.
Subject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided herein and in section 30.1-15-13, a 
formal testacy order under sections 30.1-15-09 through 30.1-15-11, including an order that the 
decedent left no valid will and determining heirs, is final as to all persons with respect to all 
issues concerning the decedent's estate that the court considered or might have considered 
incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will, and to 
the determination of heirs, except that:

The court shall entertain a petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate 
of another will of the decedent if it is shown that the proponents of the later-offered will:
a. Were unaware of its existence at the time of the earlier proceeding; or
b. Were unaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice thereof, except 

by publication.

If intestacy of all or part of the estate has been ordered, the determination of heirs of 
the   decedent   may   be   reconsidered   if   it   is   shown   that   one   or   more   persons   were 
omitted from the determination and it is also shown that the persons:
a. Were unaware of their relationship to the decedent;
b. Were unaware of the decedent's death; or 
c. Were given no notice of any proceeding concerning the decedent's estate, except 

by publication.

A petition for vacation under either subsection 1 or 2 must be filed prior to the earlier of 
the following time limits:
a.

If a personal representative has been appointed for the estate, the time of entry of 
any order approving final distribution of the estate, or, if the estate is closed by 
statement, six months after the filing of the closing statement.

b. Whether or not a personal representative has been appointed for the estate of the 
decedent, the time prescribed by section 30.1-12-08 when it is no longer possible 
to initiate an original proceeding to probate a will of the decedent.
Twelve months after the entry of the order sought to be vacated.

c.
The order originally rendered in the testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated, if 
appropriate under the circumstances, by the order of probate of the later-offered will or 
the order redetermining heirs.
The finding of the fact of death is conclusive as to the alleged decedent only if notice 
of the hearing on the petition in the formal testacy proceeding was sent by registered 
or   certified   mail   addressed   to   the   alleged   decedent   at   the   alleged   decedent's 
last-known address and the court finds that a search under subsection 2 of section 
30.1-15-03 was made.

5.

If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if notice was sent and search was made, the alleged 
decedent may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative. In addition to 
any   remedies   available   to   the   alleged   decedent   by   reason   of   any   fraud   or   intentional 
wrongdoing,   the   alleged   decedent   may   recover   any   of   the   estate   or   its   proceeds   from 
distributees which is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the extent 
that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of all of the circumstances.

30.1-15-13. (3-413) Formal testacy proceedings - Vacation of order for other cause.
For good cause shown, an order in a formal testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated 

within the time allowed for appeal.

30.1-15-14.   (3-414)   Formal   proceedings   concerning   appointment   of   personal 

A formal proceeding for adjudication regarding the priority or qualification of one who is 
an applicant for appointment as personal representative, or of one who previously has 
been   appointed   personal   representative   in   informal   proceedings,   if   an   issue 
concerning the testacy of the decedent is or may be involved, is governed by section 
30.1-15-02,  as  well  as by this section. In other cases,  the petition shall contain or 
adopt the statements required by subsection 1 of section 30.1-14-01 and describe the 
question relating to priority or qualification of the personal representative which is to be 
resolved. If the proceeding precedes any appointment of a personal representative, it 
shall stay any pending informal appointment proceedings as well as any commenced 
thereafter.   If   the   proceeding   is   commenced   after   appointment,   the   previously 
appointed  personal  representative,  after  receipt  of  notice  thereof,  shall refrain  from 
exercising any power of administration except as necessary to preserve the estate or 
unless the court orders otherwise.
After notice to interested persons, including all persons interested in the administration 
of the estate as successors under the applicable assumption concerning testacy, any 
previously   appointed   personal   representative,   and   any   person   having   or   claiming 
priority for appointment as personal representative, the court shall determine who is 
entitled to appointment under section 30.1-13-03, make a proper appointment and, if 
appropriate, terminate any prior appointment found to have been improper as provided 
in cases of removal under section 30.1-17-11.
