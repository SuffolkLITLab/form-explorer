 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

Last month, I shared with you some of the discussions 
on policy and procedures that took place while I was 
providing  training  on  library  safety  and  security  in 
different locations across Missouri. The first part of the 
workshop  was  on  active  threats,  which  can  also  be 
called active shooter or active killer. When responding 
to an active threat, the gold standard was, and to some 
extent still is, Run, Hide, Fight. The first and best option 
is to remove yourself from the situation. If you cannot 
do that, then hide in as safe a location as possible. The 
final  and  last  resort  is  to  fight. There  is  new  training 
available  called  the  ALICE  Institute.  ALICE  is  an 
acronym, which you know we love in Library Land.

A=Alert. Be alert to your surroundings. If you hear an 
unusual sound, investigate it and listen to see if you 
hear  it  again.  Listen  also  for  reactions  to  the  sound 
from others around you. 

L= Lockdown. This is the equivalent of hide, but it is 
an enhanced lockdown. If locking the door is not an 
option, use a belt or string or whatever you can find to 
wrap around door handles or the door closer (at the 
top of the door). Create a barricade by moving items 
in front of the door. The enhanced lockdown gives you 
time to assess and plan for your next actions. If there is 
more than one person, scatter around the room. Don’t 
huddle together in a closet or under a desk/table. 

I=  Inform.  Once  you  have  evacuated  safely,  call  911. 
Give  as  much  information  as  possible  including  
number  of  shooters,  location  of  shooter  if  known, 
description,  name  if  you  can  identify  the  person. 
Also, inform the people in your building. If you have 
an intercom system, use it and again be as specific as 
possible. The thought used to be to use code words 
such  as “Melville  Dewey  is  in  the  conference  room” 
but the current thought is to be as clear and concise  
as possible. 

shooter  to  stop  and  reassess  and  plan  their  next 
move. One of the attendees at my workshop referred 
to  this  as  the  OODA  loop-Observe,  Orient,  Decide,  
Act. It is how we take in information every day; we do 
it without thinking. We’re trying to force the shooter 
to enter a new loop. Your greatest weapon is strength 
in numbers. Counter as a group if possible, but each 
person gets to decide for themselves what action they 
will take. 

E=  Evacuate.  This  is  still  the  best  choice.  Remove 
yourself  as  quickly  as  possible. 
If  others  won’t  
evacuate  with  you,  leave  them  behind.  I  know 
this  sounds  harsh  and  goes  against  everything 
we  stand  for  as  librarians,  but  you  need  to  protect 
yourself. Remove yourself to the designated meeting 
point,  keeping  in  mind  that  you  could  be  using  
an  alternative  place  depending  on  how  the  threat  
event  unfolds.  If  you  have  to  break  a  window  to 
evacuate,  hit  either  of  the  top  corners  and  the  glass 
will break easier. 

These  steps  are  not  sequential.  Each  threat  event 
unfolds differently and you need to assess the situation 
and act to the best of your ability. The important thing 
is to be alert and prepared to act. 

When you approach police, be sure to do so with your 
hands in the air to show that they are empty. Do not 
slow law enforcement down by stopping them to ask 
questions. Do not run at the police. If you counter and 
take the gunman down, place the gun in a trash can 
or kick it away from you so that police can tell that you 
are not the threat. 

Your  organization  can  bring  in-person  training  on 
ALICE. Since that is not a feasible option for most of 
our libraries, individuals can take the training for $30. 
I found the training to be helpful just as an individual. 

C=  Counter.  This  would  be  the  “fight”  option.  You 
want to provide a distraction and force the shooter to 
stop and reevaluate. Use whatever weapon is at your 
disposal  including  pen  cup,  stapler,  tape  dispenser, 
stuffed  animals.  Basically,  use  whatever  you  can  put 
your  hands  on.  The  idea  is  that  you  are  forcing  the 

I am by no means an expert on active threat. Please 
work with your local law enforcement to craft a policy 
and procedures and to conduct a safety assessment of 
your space and make recommendations. There is no 
such thing as too prepared. Let’s do our best to keep 
our patrons, our staff, and ourselves safe!

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

RBDIGITAL

Summer  is  here  and  that  means  it’s  time  to  review  that  summer  reading  list  and  see  what  you 
want to dive into this summer. The only hard part about having a summer reading list is carrying 
around  all  those  books,  but  don’t  worry  about  it! With  RBdigital,  you  have  access  to  hundreds  of  
ebooks,  audiobooks,  magazines,  and  even  comics  all  in  one  app.  Maybe  you’re  brand  new  to  
RBdigital or a veteran of the database - either way, there are plenty of new items to justify a look 
around. RBdigital is an app based database that allows you access to your materials on iOS, Android, 
and Kindle Fire devices. 

The  magazines  do  not  have  a  checkout  limit  or  a  due  date.  So,  if  you  find  a  project  you  want  to 
tackle later in the summer, you can keep the magazine you found it in. The comics have a thirty day  
check  out  period,  and  the  collection  is  growing.  Find  the  first  issue  of  some  of  your  favorite  
superheroes and then check out the rest from your library or local comic book shop. 

Nothing is more time consuming than yard work. Get to that next bestseller on your reading list by 
checking out the audiobook. You can get your chores done and read the book everyone is raving 
about at the same time. Maybe you are going  camping  or  to  the  beach. With  a  14  day  check  out 
period  and  the  ability  to  adjust  the  screen  brightness,  you  can  check  out  that  book  you’ve  been 
putting off reading and relax on vacation with it. 

With so many different options, you definitely need to check it out. If you have any questions on this 
database or its app, please let us know at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

NDLCC CORNER

The  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  Council  met  in  June  at 
the Leach Public Library in Wahpeton. The Council discussed the 
upcoming grant round which will be announced in August. Grant 
opportunities  will  include  a  Partnership  Grant  and  a  General 
Collection  Development  Grant.  More  details  will  be  released 
shortly.  The  Council  also  adopted  new  Standards  for  Public 
Libraries.  We  will  be  sharing  the  final  version  very  soon  with 
libraries along with an implementation plan. 

The Council thanked the following members whose terms are up: Michele Seil, Chair and School Library 
representative  and  Carmen  Redding,  At-Large  Representative.  The  Council  will  welcome  Angie  Nagle, 
School  Library  Representative  from Turtle  Lake-Mercer  School  and  Joe  Camisa,  At-Large  Representative  
from Mandan. 

The Council accepted the resignation of Mark Holman, Special Population 
Representative.  We  will  be  accepting  applications  to  fill  that  vacancy  
until  July  15.  This  position  on  the  Council  represents  disabled,  
economically disadvantaged, and minority populations and must be filled 
by  a  practicing  librarian.  Interested  persons  may  submit  their  contact 
information  to  ndsladmn@nd.gov  and  should  fill  out  the  application  on 
the  Governor’s  website. The  State  Library  will  forward  the  names  to  the

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH:  
ND STATE DOCS: NORTH DAKOTA NATIONAL GUARD
Submitted by Angie Houser

This  month,  we  are  taking  a  look  at  digitized  state 
documents  that  the  ND  State  Library  has  on  our 
YouTube channel. 

This video is comprised of two short videos. The first 
video  is  North  Dakota  National  Guard:  Inside  Look, 
which  gives  the  viewer  a  brief  overview  of  what 
the  North  Dakota  National  Guard  does  and  how  it 
is  different  from  others  in  the  country. The  second 
video is about the creation of funding of the North 
Dakota Veterans Memorial Cemetery.
These videos were made around 1994, so though they don’t have the most current information, 
they are a great look back into the past of this organization.

By Jessica Robinson

The  early  days  of  summer  are  a  perfect  time  to  
crack  open  a  good  nonfiction  book  and  learn 
something about the world from the comfort of your 
patio. This  month,  we’ll  take  a  look  at  some  great 
new  and  upcoming  titles  that  cover  everything 
from spies to horse racing.

First  up  is  Code  Name:  Lise  by  Larry  Loftis,  a  mid-
January release that sheds a little light on the story 
of  Odette  Sansom,  an  Allied  intelligence  officer 
who became the most decorated spy in WWII after 
surviving  torture  from  the  Gestapo  and  a  stint  in 
a  concentration  camp.  Dani  Shapiro’s  Inheritance 
came  out  at  the  same  time  and  explores  the  
shocking  story  of  a  woman  who  signed  up  for 
DNA  testing  on  a  whim  and  discovered  that  her 
father  wasn’t  her  biological  father,  shattering 
the  life  she  thought  she  knew.  The  Heartbeat  of 
Wounded Knee by David Treuer was a late January 
release  and  proposes  to  be  a  continuation  of  Dee 
Brown’s  Bury  My  Heart  at  Wounded  Knee,  covering 
the  author’s  own  history  of  growing  up  on  an 
Ojibwe  reservation  in  Minnesota  and  the  broader 
modern  history  of  different  tribes  throughout  the 
country. Early February brought us Toni Morrison’s 
The  Source  of  Self-Regard,  a  moving  collection  of 
essays and speeches from one of the country’s most 
enduring  authors.  Late  February  brought  us  the 
story  of  another  enduring  American  author  in  the 
form of Samantha Seiple’s Louisa on the Front Lines, 
an account of Louisa May Alcott’s experiences as a 
nurse during the Civil War.

The  League  of  Wives  by  Heath  Hardage  was  an 
early  April  release  and  details  the  incredible  story 
of a group of military wives who worked tirelessly 
to  bring  their  POW  husbands  home  during  the 
Vietnam War. May 7 was a banner day for nonfiction 
as  it  brought  us  three  great  titles.  First  was  Casey 
Cep’s  Furious  Hours,  the  fascinating  story  of  the 
year Harper Lee spent investigating a serial murder 
in  Alabama  as  she  tried  to  wrestle  with  her  fame. 
Shawn  Levy  came  out  with  The  Castle  on  Sunset, 
an  exploration  of  the  famous  Chateau  Marmont, 

a  Hollywood  hotel  that  was  the  site  of  numerous 
celebrity  scandals.  Finally,  Lara  Prior-Palmer  wrote 
Rough Magic, the story of a young horse-lover who 
entered  the  Mongol  Derby  and  became  the  first 
female  winner  of  the  world’s  longest  horse  race. 
Late May saw the release of David Epstein’s Range, a 
sociological business book that focuses on the value 
of generalists over specialists as a way of exploring 
career paths in an increasingly-specialized world.

Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark are the hosts 
of the popular My Favorite Murder podcast and have 
recently released Stay Sexy & Don’t Get Murdered, a 
book  that  explores  their  own  obsession  with  true 
crime  in  a  frank  and  hilarious  way.  Jessica  Pan’s 
Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come is a memoir for 
introverts everywhere as it follows Pan through her 
year  of  trying  to  live  like  an  extrovert,  a  year  that 
covered everything from improve to solo vacations. 
Mid-June  will  bring  us  Susannah  Stapleton’s  The 
Adventures  of  Maud  West,  Lady  Detective,  detailing 
the  story  of  a  female  private  detective  at  the  turn 
of  the  20th  century  in  London.  The  New  Yorker’s 
Emily  Nussbaum  is  releasing  a  deep  dive  into  the 
world of television in late June with I Like to Watch, 
a  collection  of  essays  that  discuss  the  meaning  of 
prestige television in the 21st century and explores 
the symbiotic evolution of American culture and the 
television  shows  Americans  like  to  watch.  Finally, 
early October will bring us Unfollow, an incredible 
memoir  from  Megan  Phelps-Roper  as  she  writes 
about  her  experiences  as  a  child  in  the  notorious 
Westboro Baptist Church and her painful journey to 
distance herself from her family in her mid-twenties 
as  she  began  to  grow  increasingly  uncomfortable 
with their message. 

Now  that  we’ve  gotten  a  few  history  lessons  and 
explored  society  in  new  ways,  let’s  turn  away 
from nonfiction and let our imaginations run wild. 
Next month, we’ll cover the best and most highly-
anticipated fantasy novels of 2019.

Libraries and the 2020 Census (Indiana State Library) 
Tuesday, June 25, 2019, 9:00-10:00 AM (CST)
Presenter: Angie Houser, Continuing Education Coordinator

Register: http://bit.ly/2XVx6nn

Civic engagement matters! As librarians, our role in the 2020 Census is amplified this time around. In March 
of  2020,  U.S.  residents  will  not  only  receive  traditional  paper  forms  from  the  Census  Bureau,  but  they  will 
also have the option of online response. Patrons can fill out the census using their home computers, their 
smartphones, or by stopping by the local library and using a public computer. How can we properly prepare 
our library communities for this new option? Librarians can learn and review the basic facts about the census; 
we can provide informed outreach to our library communities; and we can know where to go for assistance 
outside of our libraries. Tune in to this webinar to find out more!

Circulating Board Games

Board gaming is on the rise with all age groups. Sometimes people are unsure of where to start and how 
to find a board game that is right for them. Just as there is a book for every person, I believe that there 
is a game for them too! Board games are a great way to get people off of technology and connect face 
to face. This will help people implement that service in their libraries from inception to cataloging to 
inventorying to helping patrons select games.

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR NORTH DAKOTA  
ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL OPINIONS 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This is the ninth in a series of Flickertale articles that 
aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s legal 
reference resources.

NUMBERING SYSTEM (CITATIONS) OF THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL OPINIONS

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The Flickertale. 

Next month’s article will get into more detail about 
the changes to North Dakota’s minor guardianship 
laws that will go into effect on August 1, 2019, and 
the legal research resources that will be available.

WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL 
LEGAL OPINIONS?

The  North  Dakota  Attorney  General  is  allowed  by 
state  law  to  give  written  legal  opinions,  within 
limitations.

The  Attorney  General  may  give  a  written  legal 
opinion to the following:

•  North Dakota state agencies and officials;
•  The North Dakota state legislature;
•  North Dakota county state’s attorneys;
•  Certain North Dakota city officials;
•  North Dakota water resource districts;
•  North Dakota soil conservation districts;
•  North Dakota health district boards;
•  The Judicial Conduct Commission; and
•  The Garrison Diversion Conservancy District.
• 

If the Courts have not decided a legal issue, and if the 
Attorney General has written a legal opinion on the 
issue, the Attorney General Legal Opinion controls.  
Public officials must abide by the legal opinion until 
the Courts decide the legal issue.

The  Attorney  General  may  also  give  a  written 
advisory letter.  An advisory letter does not have the 
legal effect of an Attorney General Legal Opinion.

See  North  Dakota  Century  Code  Chapter  54-12, 
which includes written legal opinions as part of the 
Attorney General’s duties.

The  Attorney  General  Legal  Opinions  have  a 
numbering  system,  also  called  the  citation,  to 
identify each legal opinion.

From 2002 to the present, the citation is made up of 
three sets of numbers and letters, each separated by 
a hyphen. 

Year.  The  year  in  which  the  legal  
opinion was issued.

First Set =  
 
Second Set =  L  of  O.  L  is  for  legal  opinion.  O  is  for  
 
Third Set =   Chronological 
 
 

chronological  order 
opinion was issued within the year.

an open records legal opinion.
Number. 

The  
in  which  the  

From 1993 to 2001, the citation is made up of three 
sets  of  numbers  and  letters,  each  separated  by  a 
hyphen, but with one difference.  The second set has 
three potential letters, rather than two.

Year.  The  year  in  which  the  legal  
opinion was issued.

First Set = 
 
Second Set =  F, L or O. F is for a legal opinion with  
statewide significance. L is for a legal  
 
opinion  with  regional  or 
 
limited  
significance.  O is for an open records  
 
legal opinion.  (F and L legal opinions  
 
have  the  same  legal  effect,  so  the  F  
 
 
designation was dropped in 2002.) 
Third Set =  Chronological 
 
 

chronological  order 
opinion was issued within the year.

The  
in  which  the  

Number. 

For  example,  the  Attorney  General  Legal  Opinion 
citation  for  the  May  24,  2019  legal  opinion  issued 
to  the  North  Dakota 
is  
2019-O-09.

Industrial  Commission 

2019 is the year in which the legal opinion was issued.
O indicates this is an open records legal opinion.
09  is  the  chronologica  order  in  which  the  open 
records legal opinion was issued in 2019.
