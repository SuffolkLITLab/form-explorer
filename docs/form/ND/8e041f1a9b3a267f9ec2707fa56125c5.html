NO AGREEMENT & 2 YEARS SINCE MOST RECENT JUDGMENT 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court;

YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS ONLY IF: 

You have a North Dakota state district court judgment that established residential responsibility 
(custody) and/or parenting time (visitation); and 

•  You want the Court to change, or modify, the judgment so that: 

o  A judgment that currently awards shared or equal residential responsibility is 

modified to award one parent primary residential responsibility, or 

o  A judgment that currently awards one parent primary residential responsibility is 
modified to award primary residential responsibility to the other parent; AND 

•  One of the following applies to your situation: 

o 

It has been 2 years or more since the original judgment or the most recently 
amended judgment; or 

o  Your current parenting plan allows for modification before two years have 

passed when an event or circumstance occurs, and the event or circumstance 
has occurred. 

IF YOU DON’T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHO MAY USE 
THIS PACKET OF FORMS 

If your situation doesn’t meet the requirements of who may use this packet of forms, you 
may bring a motion to modify primary residential responsibility.  However, neither the ND 
court system nor the ND Legal Self Help Center currently has a packet of forms for you to use. 

If you decide to represent yourself in a motion to modify where less than 2 years have passed 
since the most recent judgment and an earlier timeframe isn’t included in your parenting plan, 
you’ll need to create all of your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer to create the legal 
documents for you. 

A Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility Research Guide is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/custody. Scroll to the “Modifying Primary Residential 
Responsibility (Custody) Research Guides” section. 

The Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility Research Guide is your starting point for your 
research into modifying primary residential responsibility in an order of a North Dakota state 
district court.  The research guide also includes general information about the legal documents 
you’ll need to create in order to bring a motion to modify primary residential responsibility to a 
North Dakota state district court.

THE PARTIES 

Plaintiff: The parent who is listed as the Plaintiff in the original family law action that 
established residential responsibility (custody) and parenting time (visitation). 

Defendant: The parent who is listed as the Defendant in the original family law action that 
established residential responsibility (custody) and parenting time (visitation). 

Moving party: The parent bringing the motion to modify primary residential responsibility.  In 
other words, the parent who completes and signs the forms in this packet.  The moving party in 
the motion may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant. 

Opposing party: The other parent.  In other words, the parent who isn’t bringing the motion. 
(Also called the Non-moving party.) 

MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IS A TWO-STEP MOTION PROCESS 

(Please note that in 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “custody” to 
“residential responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

When a North Dakota state district court awards residential responsibility in a family law case, 
such as divorce, legal separation, paternity action, or other action to establish parenting rights 
and responsibilities, either parent may make a motion to ask the court to modify primary 
residential responsibility in the existing case, if certain requirements are met. 

In general, there is a 2 year time limit before either parent may request modifications to 
primary residential responsibility.  However, one exception to the 2 year time limit is when the 
parenting plan allows for an earlier time frame when an event or circumstance occurs. 

Overview of the Two-Step Motion Process: 

First Step: The parent requesting modification, the Moving party, must make a written prima 
facie case for modifying primary residential responsibility in their motion documents.   

The parent responding to the written motion, the Opposing party, has 14 days to answer the 
motion in writing.  The Opposing party’s answer documents may challenge the credibility or the 
sufficiency of the Moving party’s written argument. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 4 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

If the Opposing party doesn’t serve and file a written answer to the motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility, the Judicial Officer may consider this an admission by the Opposing 
party that the motion has merit. 

The Judicial Officer assigned to the case reviews the Moving party’s motion documents and the 
Opposing party’s answer to motion documents to determine whether the Moving party made a 
prima facie case for modifying primary residential responsibility. 

If the Moving party doesn’t make a prima facie case in writing, the motion is dismissed and 
doesn’t move to the second step. 

Second Step: An in-person, evidentiary hearing is scheduled only if the Judicial Officer assigned 
to the case finds that the Moving party made their prima facie case in writing in their motion 
documents.  At the hearing, the Moving party must present evidence to prove the allegations in 
their motion for modifying primary residential responsibility.  The Opposing party may present 
their evidence to dispute or counter the Moving Party’s evidence. 

A filing fee of $30.00 is required. 

FEES 

• 

If you’re unable to afford the filing fee, you may file a written request to waive the 
$30.00 filing fee with the District Court. 

•  Forms and instructions for a fee waiver request are available at 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. 

Other fees may apply.  The fees include, but aren’t limited to: 

•  Service fees 
Varies 
•  Copy of Documents  $.10 per page, $1.00 minimum

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions). 

“PRIMA FACIE CASE” – CASE LAW RESEARCH: 

When the decision of a motion to modify primary residential responsibility is appealed from a 
North Dakota state district court to the North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes 
their opinion to explain how and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal 
the way they did. The opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding 
later cases with similar facts and issues. 

“Prima facie case” isn’t defined in the laws enacted by the North Dakota Legislature.  You’ll 
need to research case law to define “prima facie case” and interpret what it means for your 
situation.

STEPS FOR MOVING PARTY TO MAKE A WRITTEN MOTION TO MODIFY 
PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

Step One: 
Review the Forms and Instructions; Research Laws; Make Decisions; Gather 
Information. 

Review the forms and instructions: 

Read these instructions carefully.  Review the individual forms.  Determine if the forms apply to 
your situation. If you don’t know if you should use this packet of forms, consult a lawyer who is 
licensed to practice in North Dakota.   

Research statutes and case law: 

Use the links above to research how the statutes (laws) enacted by the North Dakota 
Legislature and case law apply to your situation. 

Make decisions: 

Review the judgment you’re asking the Court to modify.  Identify the paragraphs you want the 
court to modify.  Outline how the laws and your facts support the modifications you’re 
requesting. 

Decide if you’ll reference other supporting documentation in your motion documents.  For 
example, if you identify individuals with first-hand knowledge of your situation, decide if you 
want the individual to complete an affidavit. 

Gather information: 

For example: 

•  At least one copy of the original judgment that established residential responsibility 
and/or parenting time, OR, if the original judgment has been amended, the most 
recently amended judgment.

Step Six: 
Opposing Party has 14 or 17 Days to Answer; Judicial Officer Reviews to Decide 
if Evidentiary Hearing will be Granted. 

Opposing Party Has 14 or 17 Days to Serve and File an Answer Brief and Other Supporting 
Documentation: 

After the Opposing party is served your motion documents, the Opposing party has either 14 
days or 17 days to answer the motion in writing, depending on how you arranged for service.   

• 

• 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by personal delivery, or leaving 
them at the Opposing party’s office or their lawyer’s office, the Opposing party has 14 
days to answer your motion. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion to modify was personally delivered or 

left at the Opposing party’s office or their lawyer’s office. 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by mail or third-party commercial 
carrier, the Opposing party has 17 days to answer your motion. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion to modify was mailed. 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If the Opposing party doesn’t serve and file a written answer to your motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility, the Judicial Officer may consider this an admission by the Opposing 
party that your motion has merit. 

The Judicial Officer Reviews the Motion Documents Submitted by the Moving Party and 
Opposing Party: 

After the deadline for serving and filing the answer brief and other supporting documentation 
has passed, the motion is considered to be submitted to the District Court. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 19 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

The Judicial Officer assigned to the case reviews the motion documents submitted by both you, 
the Moving party, and the Opposing party to determine if you made a prima facie case for 
modification. 

You have the burden of proving your prima facie case in your motion documents, even if the 
Opposing party doesn’t serve and file an answer brief and other supporting documentation. 

The Judicial Officer’s decision will be in writing and sent to each party. 

If the Judicial Officer Decides the Moving Party DIDN’T Make a Prima Facie Case: 

After reviewing all of the motion documents, the Judicial Officer will decide if you, the Moving 
party, made your written prima facie case for modification. 

If the Judicial Officer decides you DIDN’T make a written prima facie case, an evidentiary 
hearing isn’t scheduled and the motion is dismissed. 

If the Judicial Officer Decides the Moving Party DID Make a Prima Facie Case: 

If the Judicial Officer decides you DID make a written prima facie case, an evidentiary hearing is 
scheduled.  You’ll be notified by mail of the date, time and location of the hearing. 

You must attend the hearing and be prepared to present evidence to prove the allegations in 
your written motion documents.  If you fail to attend the hearing, your motion will be 
dismissed.

AREN’T available for every part of the evidentiary hearing process.  You’ll need to create 
many of your own legal documents for the Second Step. 

Reminder: There is no guarantee that using these forms and following the procedures outlined 
will result in the Court modifying primary residential responsibility following an evidentiary 
hearing.  Representing yourself at an evidentiary hearing is a complex and confusing process.  If 
you feel you need assistance, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota.

Step One: 
Required Meeting; Prepare Joint Informational Statement; File Joint 
Informational Statement. 

Review Rule 8.3.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-
resources/rules/ndrct/8-3-1. 

After the Judicial Officer decides that you, the Moving party, met the requirements for an 
evidentiary hearing, you and the Opposing party are required to meet in-person or by 
electronic means to prepare a Joint Informational Statement. 

The completed and signed Joint Informational Statement is filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

Individual Counties May Have a Different Joint Informational Statement Process: 

Rule 8.3.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court gives the basic requirements and timelines for 
preparing and filing a Joint Informational Statement. 

However, individual counties may have a process that is different than the basic requirements 
and timelines of Rule 8.3.1.  If the County’s process is different, a written notice, order or other 
document you receive from the Court will include the County’s process. 

If the County’s process is different, comply with that County’s requirements and timelines. 

If the County’s Process ISN’T Different, Comply with the Following Requirements and 
Timelines of Rule 8.3.1: 

You’ll Receive Written Notice of the Evidentiary Hearing: 

After the Judicial Officer decides that you, the Moving party, met the requirements for an 
evidentiary hearing, you and the Opposing party will receive the Judicial Officer’s decision in 
writing.  You and the Opposing party will also receive written notice of the date, time and 
location of the evidentiary hearing. 

(Notice of the hearing may be mailed to you separately.) 

Meet with the Opposing Party Within 30 Days of the Order for an Evidentiary Hearing: 

You, the Moving party, and the Opposing party are required to meet in-person or by electronic 
means within 30 days of the order for an evidentiary hearing.  The purpose of the meeting is to 
prepare a Joint Informational Statement. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 22 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

A Joint Informational Statement form may be included with the written notice, order or other 
document you receive from the Court.  A Joint Informational Statement form is also included in 
this packet. 

File the completed and signed Joint Informational Statement form with the Clerk of District 
Court.  You must file the completed and signed form within 7 days after the meeting. 

Step Two: 
Prepare for the Evidentiary Hearing. 

The order for the evidentiary hearing includes the date, time and location of the hearing. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible. 

Review pre-trial or trial guidebooks for self-represented individuals and lawyers: 

Preparing for an evidentiary hearing is often a complex and confusing process. Review pre-trial 
and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local public or academic 
library may have resources available. 

Gather documentation: 

For example: 

You’ll be required to prove the allegations in your motion documents.  Gather the 
documentation you believe will prove your side. 

•  At least one copy of the original judgment that established residential responsibility 
and/or parenting time, OR, if the original judgment has been amended, the most 
recently amended judgment. 

•  Your copies of the motion documents you filed with the Court in the First Step. 
•  Your copies of the supporting documentation you filed with the Court in the First Step. 
•  List of witnesses, including the individuals whose affidavits you filed with the Court in 

support of your motion in the First Step.

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully! 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern whether your evidence is admitted for 
consideration at the hearing. The Rules also govern how you object to evidence the Opposing 
party wants to admit at the hearing. 

The starting point for admitting evidence at the hearing is whether the evidence is relevant.  
You must show a reasonable connection between the evidence you want the Judicial Officer to 
consider and the legal claim you’re trying to prove. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the 
“District Court Civil” section. 

Subpoenas: 

If you require a witness to appear at the hearing or require production of documents, 
electronically stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District 
Court to issue a subpoena. Only a Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a 
subpoena. A Subpoena Informational Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/subpoenas. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing: 

At minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments.  List the evidence you believe 
will prove each of your arguments. 

Step Three: 
The Evidentiary Hearing. 

The evidentiary hearing is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the Judicial 
Officer assigned to your case.  The Moving party and Opposing party each have an opportunity 
to tell their side of the facts and argue how the laws apply to the situation. The Judicial Officer 
weighs the facts, evidence, and arguments presented by the Moving party and Opposing party 
and either grants or dismisses the motion to modify primary residential responsibility. 

If you need special assistance at the hearing: 

If you have a disability, don’t read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 24 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

Don’t be late! 

Don’t be late for your evidentiary hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason why you 
can’t go to the evidentiary hearing on the scheduled day or will be late, call the Clerk of District 
Court’s office as soon as possible. 

Be aware that even if you contact the Clerk of District Court’s office, the Judicial Officer may 
decide to hold the evidentiary hearing without you. 

Bring the information, documents, etc. that you prepared for the hearing: 

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc. that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
evidentiary hearing.  Bring the outline of what you want to say. 

Before the hearing begins: 

Organize your files and paperwork on your assigned table in the courtroom so you can easily 
locate information as needed. 

Be prepared to take notes during the hearing. 

Conduct of the hearing: 

In general, an evidentiary hearing proceeds in the following order: 

•  The evidentiary hearing officially begins when all are asked to rise when the Judicial 

Officer comes into the courtroom: 

o  The Judicial Officer begins the evidentiary hearing by identifying any documents 
that were submitted to the Clerk of District Court and identifying the names of 
the parties. 

•  Opening Statements: 

o 

If the Judicial Officer allows opening statements, the Moving party usually goes 
first. 

o  An opening statement describes the issues and states what the party expects to 

prove during the hearing. 

•  You, the Moving Party, Present your Case: 

o  You have the burden of proving the allegations in your motion documents. 
o  You may call individuals with first-hand knowledge to testify. 
o  You may testify on your own behalf. 
o  The Opposing party may object to the evidence you present.  The North Dakota 
Rules of Evidence govern how you respond to objections to your evidence. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 25 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

•  The Opposing Party has the Option to Cross-Examine your Witnesses: 

o  After you finish direct questioning of a witness, the Opposing party has a chance 

to ask your witness questions. This is called cross-examination. 
If you testify on your own behalf, the Opposing party may cross-examine you. 
o 
o  The Opposing party may only ask questions about the topics covered during your 

direct questioning of your witness. 

•  The Opposing Party Presents their Case: 

o  The Opposing party presents their evidence, including witnesses with first-hand 

knowledge. 

o  You may object to the evidence presented by the Opposing party.  The North 

Dakota Rules of Evidence govern how you object to evidence. 

•  You have the Option to Cross-Examine the Opposing Party’s Witnesses: 

o  After the Opposing party finishes direct questioning of a witness, you have the 

o 

chance to cross-examine the witness. 
If the Opposing party testifies on their own behalf, you may cross-examine the 
Opposing party. 

o  You may only ask questions about the topics covered during the Opposing 

party’s direct questioning of their witness. 

•  Closing Arguments: 

o 

If the Judicial Officer allows closing arguments, the Moving party usually goes 
first. 

o  A closing argument is a summary of the evidence presented at the hearing and 
an argument to the Judicial Officer on how the motion should be decided. 

The Judicial Officer May Decide the Motion at the End of the Hearing OR Decide at a Later 
Date: 

At the end of the hearing, the Judicial Officer may make a final decision on the motion or may 
decide to make a final decision at a later date. 

If the Judicial Officer makes a final decision at the end of the hearing, the Judicial Officer may 
require the party who won to prepare an amended judgment that includes the modifications to 
primary residential responsibility. 

If the Judicial Officer DOESN’T make a final decision at the end of the hearing, the Judicial 
Officer will make a decision at a later date.  You’ll receive the Judicial Officer’s decision in 
writing. 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 26 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

The Judicial Officer May Require You to Prepare a Proposed Order to Amend Judgment and a 
Proposed Amended Judgment: 

An order to amend judgment explains why the Judicial Officer decided you met the 
requirements to modify primary residential responsibility, and lists the exact modifications to 
the current judgment.  An order to amend judgment is signed by the Judicial Officer. 

An amended judgment is a recreation of the current judgment with all of the modifications 
from the order to amend judgment.  An amended judgment is signed by either the Judicial 
Officer or the Clerk of Court. 

If you are required to prepare a proposed order to amend judgment and a proposed amended 
judgment, you must serve copies on all parties, and file proof of service with the Clerk of 
District Court. 

•  Go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action for information about 
service and affidavit of service forms.  Review the information in the “Service After a 
District Court Civil Action Has Started” section. 

The Judicial Officer will decide whether your proposed order to amend judgment and a 
proposed amended judgment are appropriate. 

If the Judicial Officer decides they are appropriate, the Judicial Officer will sign and date the 
proposed order to amend judgment, and either the Judicial Officer or the Clerk of Court will 
sign the proposed amended judgment. 

The order to amend judgment and the amended judgment aren’t official until appropriately 
signed and dated. 

Step Four: 
Appealing the Final Order. 

There are up to two ways to request a review of a final order in a motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility.   

Review of a Judicial Referee Final Order by a District Court Judge: 

If a Judicial Referee issued the final order in a motion to modify primary residential 
responsibility, either party may file a written request for review by a District Court Judge. 

 

www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 27 of 28 

Modify PRR MP Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

If a party decides to file a request, the written request for review must: 

•  Be filed with the District Court within 7 days after service of the Notice of the Right to 

Review; and 

•  State the reasons the party requests the review. 

The District Court Judge who reviews the Judicial Referee’s final order may: 

•  Adopt the Judicial Referee’s findings in the final order; 
•  Send the final order back to the Judicial Referee for additional findings; or 
•  Reject the Judicial Referee’s findings in the final order. 

o 

If the District Court Judge rejects the Judicial Referee’s findings, the Judge must 
issue their own findings of fact, with or without a hearing. 

When a Judicial Referee issues the final order in a motion to modify primary residential 
responsibility, parties aren’t required to request a review of a Judicial Referee’s final order.  A 
party may skip this option and appeal the final order to the North Dakota Supreme Court. 

Appeal a Final Order to the North Dakota Supreme Court 

Either party may appeal a final order in a motion to modify primary residential responsibility to 
the North Dakota Supreme Court. 

The Notice of Appeal must be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within sixty (60) days of 
the District Court Judicial Officer’s final order. 

A guide to the North Dakota Supreme Court appeals process is found at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/district-court-appeal-to-supreme-court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
