Part 4: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 1 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

You may use these Part 4 forms if: 

1.  You’re the guardian and/or conservator of an adult who was appointed by 

another (non-North Dakota) state court.  You were appointed when the ward 
and/or protected person was 18 years old or older. 

2.  A North Dakota state district court issued a provisional order to accept the 

transfer of jurisdiction of the entire guardianship and/or conservatorship case 
from the other state. 

AND 

AND 

3.  The other state court issued a FINAL order transferring jurisdiction of the entire 
guardianship and/or conservatorship case to North Dakota.  You now need the 
North Dakota State District Court to issue a FINAL order accepting the transfer of 
jurisdiction to North Dakota. 

This is a 5 Part process.  ALL 5 Parts MUST be completed. 

Transferring jurisdiction of a guardianship and/or conservatorship case from the court of 
another state to a North Dakota state district court is a 5 Part process. 

You must complete all 5 Parts to transfer jurisdiction of the entire guardianship 
and/or conservatorship to a North Dakota state district court. 

Part 1. You Work with the Other State Court to Get a Provisional Order Transferring 

Jurisdiction of the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship to North Dakota. 

You must work directly with the other state to fulfill the other state court’s process for 
obtaining a provisional order transferring jurisdiction of the entire guardianship and/or 
conservatorship case to a North Dakota state district court. 

The North Dakota state court system and the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center can’t 
assist you with Part 1 of the process. 

Part 4: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 2 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

Part 2. You Petition the North Dakota State District Court for a Provisional Order to 

Accept the Transfer of Jurisdiction of the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship 
from the Other State Court. 

Instructions and a set of forms for completing Part 2 are available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer. 

Part 3. If the North Dakota State District Court issues a Provisional Order to Accept 
Transfer of Jurisdiction, You Work with the Other State Court to Get a Final 
Order Transferring Jurisdiction to North Dakota and Terminating the Other 
State’s Guardianship and/or Conservatorship. 

You must work directly with the other state to fulfill the other state court’s process for 
obtaining a final order transferring jurisdiction of the entire guardianship and/or 
conservatorship case to a North Dakota state district court. 

The North Dakota state court system and the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center can’t 
assist you with Part 3 of the process. 

Part 4. After the Other State Issues a Final Order Transferring Jurisdiction to North 

Dakota, Make a Motion for a Final Order to Accept Transfer of Jurisdiction of the 
Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Case to North Dakota. 

These are the instructions for the set of forms to complete Part 4. 

Part 5. If the North Dakota State District Court Issues a Final Order to Accept Transfer of 
Jurisdiction, Within 90 Days of the Final Order, the Court Must Determine 
Whether the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Needs to be Modified to 
Conform to North Dakota’s Laws.

Part 4 Forms in the Packet 

You may use these forms to complete Part 4 of the process.  If you’re unsure how to proceed 
or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation, consult an attorney.

Conservatorship from Another State;

Steps for Completing Part 4 of the 5 Part Process 

These forms allow one guardian or one conservator to motion the North Dakota state 
district court for a final order on their own. 

These forms also allow a co-guardian or co-conservator to join the motion with the 
guardian or conservator, as long as they joined the petition in Part 2 of the process. 

If you don’t know if you should use this packet of forms, consult a lawyer who is licensed to 
practice in North Dakota.  ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you 
make any decisions about these forms. 

Step One: Complete Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 of the 5 Part Process; Complete 
the Rule 59 Requirements; and Gather Information. 

You must complete Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 BEFORE you can start Part 4 of the Process. 

If you haven’t already completed Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 of the transfer process, you must do 
so before starting Part 4. 

Part 4: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 6 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

Instructions and forms for Part 2 are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/conservatorship/transfer. 

You must work directly with the state court of the other state to complete Part 1 and Part 3.  
ND Court System staff and ND Legal Self Help Center staff can’t provide any assistance with 
Part 1 or Part 3. 

If you need assistance with Part 1 and Part 3, check to see if the other state court system has a 
legal self-help program that can provide information about that state court’s processes.  Check 
for legal service providers in the other state who may have information available.  Check with 
the other state’s Bar Association for attorney referral programs that can help you find an 
attorney to hire to represent you. 

If You’re a Guardian, Complete the Rule 59 Requirements: 

If the court of the other state appointed you the conservator ONLY, skip to the “Gather 
Information” section on the next page. 

If the court of the other state appointed you the guardian of the ward, you must meet the 
requirements of Rule 59 of the North Dakota Administrative Rules BEFORE the North Dakota 
State District Court can accept the transfer of jurisdiction from another state. 

You’ll need to complete ALL of the Rule 59 requirements BEFORE you complete Part 4. 

Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-guardianship/guardian-of-adult-qualifications-and-
affidavits for Rule 59 affidavits and other resources. 

Go to guardianship.ndcourts.gov to register for and complete the required guardianship 
training course. 

You’ll need the following documents to serve and file with the Court in Step 3 and Step 4: 

•  Affidavit of Proposed Nonprofessional Guardian 

o  Read Rule 59 CAREFULLY and review the affidavit forms!  You need to determine 
if you’re a nonprofessional or professional guardian and choose the appropriate 
affidavit form. 

•  Certificate of Completion of the North Dakota Guardianship Training Course 
•  Criminal History Record Check Report. 

o  You’ll need a report for each state where you’ve lived and each state where you 

have a criminal history. 

o  A criminal history doesn’t automatically disqualify a potential guardian. 

Part 4: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 7 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

Gather Information: 

•  A certified copy of the other state court’s final order transferring jurisdiction of the 

guardianship and/or conservatorship to North Dakota.

check, and certificate of completion for the North Dakota Guardianship Training Course.

Step Four: File the Original, Completed Forms with the Clerk of District Court. 

File the following original, completed forms with the Clerk of the District Court that currently 
has authority over the guardianship and/or conservatorship: 

•  Form 1: Notice of Motion for Final Order to Accept Transfer of Guardianship/ 

Conservatorship from Another State; 

•  Form 2: Motion for Final Order to Accept Transfer of Guardianship/Conservatorship 

from Another State; 

•  Form 3: Brief in Support of Motion for Final Order to Accept Transfer of Guardianship/

and/or Request a Hearing. 

After each person required to receive notice is served the documents from Step Four, they have 
17 days to answer the motion in writing or request a hearing, or both. 

• 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by mail, they have 17 days to 
answer your motion in writing, request a hearing, or both. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion documents were mailed to the person 

required to receive notice. 

     

Part 4: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 15 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day the person was served; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If the persons required to receive notice don’t serve and file a written answer to your motion or 
request a hearing, the judge may consider your motion unopposed. 

Step Six(a): If the Motion will be Decided on ONLY the Documents Filed with the 
Court, the Judge Reviews the Documents Without Holding a Hearing. 

After the deadline passes for answer to motion documents and request for hearing 
documents to be served and filed, if no one requested a hearing, the judge assigned to your 
case will review the documents filed by you and persons required to receive notice of your 
motion. 

Your motion will be decided only on the documents filed with the court. No hearing will be 
held. 

If no person required to receive notice served and filed an answer to your motion, your motion 
documents are still required to prove you meet the requirements for the court to issue a final 
order accepting the transfer jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or conservatorship from 
another state. 

Step Six(b): If Anyone Requested a Hearing, Attend the Hearing. 

You must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  If you don’t go to court, the judge won’t 
grant your motion.  Be sure to be on time. Bring to the hearing: 

•  Your copies of the completed forms you filed with the Clerk of Court’s Office; 
•  Any evidence you want the Judge to know about; and 
•  Any witnesses you want to talk to the Judge. 

The Judge won’t allow you to use as evidence (and will not look at) any documents (such as 
letters, notes, or statements) written by someone other than yourself unless the person who 
wrote the document is in court at the hearing. 

Part 4: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 16 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

If you want the judge to hear what someone else has to say about your case, that person MUST 
be at the hearing – YOU can’t tell the judge what that person said or has to say. You may force 
someone to attend the hearing by serving a subpoena on that person prior to the date of the 
hearing. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide and a Subpoena Informational Guide are available at 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” Section. 

Step Seven: The Judge Decides Whether to Grant a Final Order to Transfer 
Jurisdiction to Another State and Terminate the North Dakota case. 

If the Judge DOESN’T Grant Your Motion for a Final Order to Accept Transfer of Jurisdiction: 

If the Judge doesn’t grant your motion for a final order accepting the transfer of jurisdiction of 
the guardianship and/or conservatorship from another state, the other state court keeps their 
authority over the guardianship and or conservatorship. 

If the Judge GRANTS Your Motion for a Final Order to Accept Transfer of Jurisdiction: 

If the Judge grants your motion for a final order accepting the transfer of jurisdiction of the 
guardianship and/or conservatorship from another state, the Judge will sign a final order 
accepting the transfer of jurisdiction into North Dakota. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign your proposed final order, or may 

decide to sign a different proposed final order. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms. 

YOU MUST COMPLETE PART 5! 

If the judge or judicial referee signs the final order accepting the transfer of jurisdiction to 
North Dakota, you’ll likely have a hearing within 90 days to determine if your out-of-state 
guardianship/conservatorship order meets North Dakota’s legal requirements. 

Part 5 has forms and instructions for this last part of the 5 part process.
