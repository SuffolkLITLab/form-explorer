appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because of unjustifiable conduct, the 
court may:
a. Decline to exercise jurisdiction;
b.

Exercise jurisdiction for the limited purpose of fashioning an appropriate remedy 
to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the respondent or the protection of the 
respondent's   property   or   prevent   a   repetition   of   the   unjustifiable   conduct, 
including staying the proceeding until a petition for the appointment of a guardian 
or   issuance   of   a   protective   order   is   filed   in   a   court   of   another   state   having 
jurisdiction; or

c. Continue to exercise jurisdiction after considering:

(1) The extent to which the respondent and all persons required to be notified of 

the proceedings have acquiesced in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction;

(2) Whether it is a more appropriate forum than the court of any other state 

under the factors set forth in subsection 3 of section 28-35-11; and

(3) Whether the court of any other state would have jurisdiction under factual 
circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional standards of 
section 28-35-09.

2.

If   a   court   of   this   state   determines   that   the   court   acquired   jurisdiction   to   appoint   a 
guardian or issue a protective order because a party seeking to invoke its jurisdiction 
engaged in unjustifiable conduct, the court may assess against that party necessary 
and  reasonable  expenses,   including  attorney's  fees,   investigative  fees,  court   costs, 
communication expenses, witness fees and expenses, and travel expenses. The court 
may   not   assess   fees,   costs,   or   expenses   of   any   kind   against   this   state   or   a 
governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of this state unless authorized by 
law other than this chapter.

If the court in this state does not have jurisdiction under section 28-35-08, whether at 
the time the petition is filed or at any time before the appointment or issuance of the 
order, the court shall stay the proceeding and communicate with the court in the other 
state. If the court in the other state has jurisdiction, the court in this state shall dismiss 
the petition unless the court in the other state determines that the court in this state is 
a more appropriate forum.

An objection to the transfer has not been made or, if an objection has been made,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
