14-07.1-02. Domestic violence protection order.
1.

An   action   for   a   protection   order   commenced   by   a   verified   application   alleging   the 
existence   of   domestic   violence   may   be   brought   in   district   court   by   any   family   or 
household member or by any other person if the court determines that the relationship 
between   that   person   and   the   alleged   abusing   person   is   sufficient   to   warrant   the 
issuance of a domestic violence protection order. An action may be brought under this 
section, regardless of whether a petition for legal separation, annulment, or divorce 
has been filed.

2. Upon receipt of the application, the court shall order a hearing to be held not later than 
fourteen days from the date of the hearing order, or at a later date if good cause is 
shown.
Service must be made upon the respondent at least five days prior to the hearing. If 
service cannot be made, the court may set a new date.

3.

4. Upon   a   showing   of   actual   or   imminent   domestic   violence,   the   court   may   enter   a 
protection order after due notice and full hearing. The relief provided by the court may 
include any or all of the following:
a. Restraining any party from threatening, molesting, injuring, harassing, or having 

b.

c.

contact with any other person.
Excluding either the respondent or any person with whom the respondent lives 
from the dwelling they share, from the residence of another person against whom 
the domestic violence is occurring, or from a domestic violence care facility, if this 
exclusion is necessary to the physical or mental well-being of the applicant or 
others.
Awarding   temporary   custody   or   establishing   temporary   visitation   rights   with 
regard to minor children.

d. Recommending or requiring that either or both parties undergo counseling with a 
domestic violence program or other agency that provides professional services 
that   the   court   deems   appropriate.   The   court   may   request   a   report   from   the 

Page No. 1

5.

6.

8.

designated agency within a time period established by the court. The costs of the 
court-ordered   initial   counseling   assessment   and   subsequent   reports   must   be 
borne by the parties or, if indigent, by the respondent's county of residence.
e. Requiring a party to pay such support as may be necessary for the support of a 
party and any minor children of the parties and reasonable attorney's fees and 
costs.
Awarding temporary use of personal property, including motor vehicles, to either 
party.

f.

g. Requiring   the   respondent   to   surrender   for   safekeeping   any   firearm   or   other 
specified   dangerous   weapon,   as   defined   in   section   12.1-01-04,   in   the 
respondent's   immediate   possession   or   control   or   subject   to   the   respondent's 
immediate control, if the court has probable cause to believe that the respondent 
is likely to use, display, or threaten to use the firearm or other dangerous weapon 
in any further acts of violence. If so ordered, the respondent shall surrender the 
firearm or other dangerous weapon to the sheriff, or the sheriff's designee, of the 
county in which the respondent resides or to the chief of police, or the chief's 
designee, of the city in which the respondent resides  in the manner and at the 
time and place determined by that law enforcement officer. If the firearm or other 
dangerous weapon is not surrendered, the law enforcement officer may arrest the 
respondent pursuant to section 14-07.1-11 and take possession of the firearm or 
other dangerous weapon.

A court  of competent jurisdiction  may issue a dual  protection order  restricting both 
parties involved in a domestic violence dispute if each party has commenced an action 
pursuant  to  subsection  1  and  the  court,  after   a  hearing,   has  made  specific  written 
findings of fact that both parties committed acts of domestic violence and that neither 
party   acted   in   self-defense.   The   order   must   clearly   define   the   responsibilities   and 
restrictions   placed   upon   each   party  so   that   a   law   enforcement   officer   may   readily 
determine which party has violated the order if a violation is alleged to have occurred.
The court may amend its order or agreement at any time upon subsequent petition 
filed by either party.

7. No   order   or   agreement   under   this   section   affects   title   to   any   real   property   in   any 

matter.
The petition for an order for protection must contain a statement listing each civil or 
criminal action involving both parties.

9. Upon the application of an individual residing within the state, a court may issue a 
domestic violence protection order or an ex parte temporary protection order under 
this   chapter   even   though   the   actions   constituting   domestic   violence   occurred 
exclusively outside the state. In these cases, a respondent is subject to the personal 
jurisdiction of this state upon entry into this state. If the domestic violence justifying the 
issuance   of   a   protection   order   under   this   chapter   occurred   exclusively   outside   the 
state, the relief that may be granted is limited to an order restraining the party from 
having contact with or committing acts of domestic violence on another person in this 
state.

10. Whenever a protection order is issued, extended, modified, or terminated under this 
section, the court shall transmit the order electronically to the bureau. The bureau shall 
enter   the   order   electronically   in   the   national   crime   information   center   database 
provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency. The sheriff of 
the   county   in   which   the   order   was   issued   shall   maintain   and   respond   to   inquiries 
regarding the record in the national crime information center database provided by the 
federal   bureau   of   investigation,   or   its   successor   agency,   pursuant   to   bureau   and 
federal requirements. Whenever a protection order is issued, the clerk of court shall 
forward a copy of the order to the local law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over 
the residence of the protected party by the close of business on the day the protection 
order is issued. Once the bureau, after consultation with the state court administrator, 
determines and implements an electronic method to notify the sheriff of the county that 

Page No. 2

issued   the   order,   the   clerk   of   court's   requirement   to   forward   the   order   to   a   law 
enforcement agency will be satisfied.

14-07.1-02.1. Allegation of domestic violence - Effect.
If   the   court   finds   that   a   party's   allegation   of   domestic   violence   in   a   domestic   violence 
protection   order   proceeding,   divorce   proceeding,   child   custody   proceeding,   child   visitation 
proceeding, separation proceeding, or termination of parental rights proceeding is false and not 
made in good faith, the court shall order the party making the false allegation to pay court costs 
and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the other party in responding to the allegation.

14-07.1-02.2.   Foreign   domestic   violence   protection   orders  -  Full   faith   and   credit 

recognition and enforcement.

Repealed by S.L. 2003, ch. 123, § 3.

14-07.1-03. Temporary protection order - Copy to law enforcement agency.
1.

If an application under section 14-07.1-02 alleges an immediate and present danger of 
domestic violence to the applicant, based upon an allegation of a recent incident of 
actual domestic violence, the court may grant an ex parte temporary protection order, 
pending a full hearing, granting such relief as the court deems proper.
An ex parte temporary protection order may include:
a. Restraining any party from having contact with or committing acts of domestic 

2.

b.

c.

violence on another person.
Excluding the respondent or any person with whom the respondent lives from the 
dwelling they share, from the residence of another person, or from a domestic 
violence shelter care facility.
Awarding   temporary   custody   or   establishing   temporary   visitation   rights   with 
regard to minor children.

d. Requiring   the   respondent   to   surrender   for   safekeeping   any   firearm   or   other 
specified   dangerous   weapon,   as   defined   in   section   12.1-01-04,   in   the 
respondent's   immediate   possession   or   control   or   subject   to   the   respondent's 
immediate control, if the court has probable cause to believe that the respondent 
is likely to use, display, or threaten to use the firearm or other dangerous weapon 
in any further acts of violence. If so ordered, the respondent shall surrender the 
firearm or other dangerous weapon to the sheriff, or the sheriff's designee, of the 
county   in   which   the   respondent   resides   or   the   chief   of   police,   or   the   chief's 
designee, of the city in which the respondent resides.

3. Unless   otherwise   terminated   by   the   court,   an   ex   parte   temporary   protection   order 

4.

remains in effect until an order issued under section 14-07.1-02 is served.
A full hearing as provided by section 14-07.1-02 must be set for not later than fourteen 
days from the issuance of the temporary order, or at a later date if good cause is 
shown. The respondent must be served forthwith with a copy of the ex parte order 
along with a copy of the application and notice of the date set for the hearing.

5. Whenever a temporary protection order is issued, extended, modified, or terminated 
under   this   section,   the   court   shall   transmit   the   order   electronically   to   the   bureau. 
Whenever a temporary protection order is issued, the clerk of court shall forward a 
copy   of   the   order   to   the   local   law   enforcement   agency   with   jurisdiction   over   the 
residence   of   the   protected   party  by  the   close   of   business   on   the  day  the   order   is 
issued.   Once   the   bureau,   after   consultation   with   the   state   court   administrator, 
determines and implements an electronic method to notify the sheriff of the county that 
issued the order, the clerk of court's requirement to forward the order will be satisfied.
Fees for filing and service of process may not be assessed to the petitioner for any 
proceeding seeking relief under chapter 14-07.1.

14-07.1-03.1. Notification of stalking law.
When an order is issued under section 14-07.1-02 or 14-07.1-03, the order must include or 

have attached to it a copy of section 12.1-17-07.1.

14-07.1-04. Assistance of law enforcement officer in service or execution.
When   an   order   is   issued   upon   request   of   the   applicant   under   section   14-07.1-02   or 
14-07.1-03,   the   court   shall   order   the   sheriff   or   other   appropriate   law   enforcement   officer   to 
accompany the applicant and assist in placing the applicant in possession of the dwelling or 
residence, or otherwise assist in execution or service of the protection order, which may include 
assistance in referral to a domestic violence shelter care facility.

14-07.1-05. Right to apply for relief.
A person's right to apply for relief under section 14-07.1-02 or 14-07.1-03 is not affected if 
the person leaves  the residence or  dwelling  to avoid domestic violence.  The court  may not 
require  security  or  bond  from  any party  unless  the  court  deems  it  necessary in  exceptional 
cases.

14-07.1-05.1. Appointment of guardian ad litem for minor.
The court, upon the request of either party or upon its own motion, may appoint a guardian 
ad litem in an action for a protection order to represent a minor concerning custody, support, or 
visitation if either party or the court has reason for special concern as to the immediate future of 
the minor. The guardian ad litem may be appointed at the time of a temporary protection order 
or at any time before the full hearing. The role of the guardian ad litem consists of investigation 
and making a recommendation and report to the court. At no time may the involvement of the 
guardian ad litem alter the requirements set forth in section 14-07.1-03. The appointment of the 
guardian ad litem expires immediately after the full hearing unless the court retains the right, 
upon specific finding of need, to continue the appointment of a guardian ad litem to participate in 
visitation.   The   guardian   ad litem   shall   have   access   to   records   before   the   court   except   as 
otherwise   provided   by  law.  The   court   may  direct   either   or   both   parties   to  pay  the  guardian 
ad litem fees established by the court. If neither party is able to pay the fees, the court, after 
notice to the state's attorney of the county of venue, may direct the fees to be paid, in whole or 
in part, by the county of venue. The court may direct either or both parties to reimburse the 
county, in whole or in part, for the payment.

14-07.1-06. Penalty for violation of a protection order.
Whenever a protection order is granted under section 14-07.1-02 or 14-07.1-03 and the 
respondent or individual to be restrained has been served a copy of the order, the first violation 
of any order is a class A misdemeanor and also constitutes contempt of court. A second or 
subsequent violation of any protection order is a class C felony. For purposes of this section, 
"first violation" means the first time any order is violated and a second or subsequent violation of 
any protection order includes two or more violations of protection orders.

14-07.1-07. Nonexclusive remedy.
Any proceeding under sections 14-07.1-01 through 14-07.1-08 is in addition to any other 

civil or criminal remedies.

14-07.1-08. Emergency relief.
When the court is unavailable an application may be  filed before a local magistrate, as 
defined by subsection 3 of section 29-01-14, who may grant relief in accordance with section 
14-07.1-03, upon good cause shown in an ex parte proceeding, if it is deemed necessary to 
protect   the   applicant   or   others   from   domestic   violence.   Immediate   and   present   danger   of 
domestic violence to the applicant or others constitutes good cause for purposes of this section. 
Any   order   issued   under   this   section   expires   seventy-two   hours   after   its   issuance,   unless 
continued by the court, or the local magistrate in the event of continuing unavailability of the 
court. At that time, the applicant may seek a temporary order from the court. Any order issued 

Page No. 4

under this section and any documentation in support of the order must be immediately certified 
to the court.  The  certification to the court  has the effect  of  commencing  proceedings under 
section 14-07.1-02.

14-07.1-08.1. Domestic violence court.
The district court may require an individual who has committed a crime involving domestic 
violence, as defined in this chapter, or who has violated a domestic violence protection order to 
complete   domestic   violence   treatment   under   the   direction   of   the   domestic   violence   court 
program as a condition of probation in accordance with rules adopted by the supreme court. If 
the district court finds a defendant has failed to undergo an evaluation or complete treatment or 
has violated any condition of probation, the district court shall revoke the defendant's probation 
and shall sentence the defendant in accordance with chapter 12.1-32.

14-07.1-09. Immunity from liability - Penalty for false reports.
Repealed by S.L. 1989, ch. 589, § 16.

14-07.1-10. Arrest procedures.
1.

If   a   law   enforcement   officer   has   probable   cause   to   believe   that   a   person   has 
committed   a   crime   involving   domestic   violence,   whether   the   offense   is   a  felony  or 
misdemeanor, and whether or not the crime was committed in the presence of the 
officer,   the   law   enforcement   officer   shall   presume   that   arresting   the   person   is   the 
appropriate response.
A law enforcement officer investigating a crime involving domestic violence may not 
threaten, suggest, or otherwise indicate, for the purpose of discouraging requests for 
law   enforcement   intervention,   that   family   or   household   members   will   be   arrested. 
When complaints are received from two or more family or household members, the 
officer shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine if either party acted in 
self-defense   as   defined   in   section   12.1-05-03.   If   self-defense   is   not   a   factor,   to 
determine whether to seek an arrest warrant or to pursue further investigation, the 
officer   shall   consider   which   party   was   the   predominant   aggressor   by   considering 
certain factors, including the comparative severity of injuries involved, any history of 
domestic violence, or any other violent acts that the officer can reasonably ascertain 
and the likelihood of future harm.
An individual arrested for a crime involving domestic violence may not be released on 
bail  or  on the individual's  personal  recognizance unless the individual  has made  a 
personal appearance before a magistrate pursuant to rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules 
of Criminal Procedure.

14-07.1-11. Arrest without warrant.
1.

A law enforcement officer shall arrest a person without a warrant if the person has 
committed   the   offense   of   violating   a   protection   order   under   section   14-07.1-06, 
whether or not the violation was committed in the presence of the officer.
A law enforcement officer may arrest a person without a warrant if the arrest is made 
within twelve hours from the time the officer determines there is probable cause to 
arrest   for   an   assault   of   a   family   or   household   member   as   defined   in   section 
14-07.1-01, whether or not the assault took place in the presence of the officer. After 
twelve hours has elapsed, the officer must secure an arrest warrant before making an 
arrest. A law enforcement officer may not arrest a person pursuant to this subsection 
without first observing that there has been recent physical injury to, or impairment of 
physical condition of, the alleged victim.
A law enforcement officer may not be held criminally or civilly liable for making an 
arrest pursuant to this section if the officer acts in good faith on probable cause and 
without malice.

14-07.1-12. Reports.
A law enforcement officer shall make a written report of the investigation of any allegation of 
domestic violence regardless of whether an arrest was made. If an officer determines through 
the course of an investigation that one of the individuals was the predominant aggressor, the 
report must include the name of that individual and a description of the evidence that supports 
the findings. The officer shall submit the report to the officer's supervisor or to any other person 
to whom the officer is required to submit similar reports.

14-07.1-13. Order prohibiting contact - Penalty.
Repealed by S.L. 2009, ch. 134, § 3.

14-07.1-14. Law enforcement guidelines and training.
1.

Every law enforcement agency shall develop and implement, with assistance from the 
criminal justice training and statistics division, specific operational guidelines for arrest 
policies and procedures in crimes involving domestic violence. The guidelines must 
include procedures for the conduct of criminal investigations, procedures for arrests 
and   victim   assistance   by   law   enforcement   officers,   procedures   concerning   the 
provision of services to victims, and any additional procedures as may be necessary to 
carry out sections 14-07.1-02 through 14-07.1-14.
The peace officer standards and training board shall establish, in conjunction with the

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
