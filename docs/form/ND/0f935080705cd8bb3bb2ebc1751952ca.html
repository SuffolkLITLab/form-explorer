 A CONTINUANCE OF A HEARING OR TRIAL IN A CIVIL MATTER; AND/OR 

 AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO ANSWER A SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, 
   ANSWER A MOTION IN A CIVIL MATTER, OR OTHER WRITTEN RESPONSE. 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if these forms 
and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer.  For more information about finding 
a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov by clicking on the “Self 
Help” link.  

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for making a request to a North Dakota state court for a continuance of a hearing or 
trial, for an extension of time to answer, or other written response.  There’s no guarantee that all 
judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The Center

SEE THE “MOTIONS” SECTION OF THE GUIDE TO A DISTRICT COURT CIVIL ACTION on the ND 
Legal Self Help Center website for additional information and resources about motions. 

After a civil action is filed with the court, a party in a civil action may ask the court for a hearing 
or trial to be continued for a different date and time, ask for an extension of time to answer a 
summons and complaint or answer a motion, or an extension of time for another type of 
written response.  The court decides whether to grant the motion. 

The party making the motion is the “Moving Party.”  The party responding to the motion is the 
“Opposing Party.” 

FORMS IN THE PACKET: 

•  Form 1: Notice of Motion for Continuance/Extension; 
•  Form 2: Motion for Continuance/Extension; 
•  Form 3: Brief in Support of Motion for Continuance/Extension; 
•  Form 4: Declaration in Support Motion for Continuance/Extension; 
•  Form 5: Order on Motion for Continuance/Extension (Proposed); and 
•  Form 6: Declaration of Service by Mail. 

After you’ve completed the forms, a copy of the completed notice of motion, motion, brief in 
support of motion, declaration in support of motion, and (proposed) order must be served on 
all other parties in the civil action.  You must file proof of service with the court that you served 
copies on all other parties. 

NORTH DAKOTA CONTINUANCE/EXTENTION RULES  

Review the following North Dakota Rules carefully.  You aren’t required to hire an attorney to 
access the court system.  If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, 
laws and procedures that an attorney is required to follow. 

Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: This is the general extension rule for civil 
actions.  A court may extend, for good cause, the time a party may or must act.  If the time to 
act has expired, the party’s failure to meet the deadline must be excusable. Rule 6 is available 
at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp/6. 

Rule 3.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court: This is the extension rule specifically for motions 
in civil actions.  A court may extend the time for filing briefs or other motion documents.  Rule 
3.2 is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct/3-2.
