      <pre>CHAPTER 27-08.1
SMALL CLAIMS COURT

2.

27-08.1-01. Small claims court - Jurisdictional limits - Venue.
1.

All judges of the district courts may exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this chapter, 
and while sitting in the exercise of that jurisdiction must be known and referred to as 
the "small claims court". The jurisdiction of this court is confined to cases for recovery 
of money, or the cancellation of any agreement involving material fraud, deception, 
misrepresentation, or false promise, when the value of the agreement or the amount 
claimed by the plaintiff or the defendant does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars.
The proceedings in this court must be commenced:
a.

If the defendant is a corporation, limited liability company, or a partnership, in any 
county in which the defendant has a place of business or in any county in which 
the subject matter of the claim occurred.
If the claim is for collection of a check written without sufficient funds or without 
an account, in the county where the check was passed, or in the county of the 
defendant's residence or place of business.
If the defendant is an individual and the claim is for collection of an open account 
on which credit has been extended:
(1)
(2)

In the county of the defendant's residence or place of business; or
If the amount of the claim is less than one thousand dollars and is not from a 
telephone   or   mail   order   transaction,   in   the   county  where   the   transaction 
occurred or in the county of the defendant's residence or place of business.

b.

c.

d.

e.

f.

If the defendant is an individual and the claim is not made under subdivision b 
or c, in the county of the defendant's residence.
If   the   defendant   is   an   individual   and   the   claim   arose   as   the   result   of   the 
defendant's lease of real property or as the result of a dispute over disposition of 
earnest money or other money deposit arising from a contract to purchase real 
property, in the county where the real property is located unless the plaintiff and 
the defendant consent in writing to a proceeding in a different county.
If the plaintiff is a political subdivision and the claim is for a public utility debt, in 
the county in which the political subdivision is located.

3.

Except for an action under subdivision c, e, or f of subsection 2, the defendant may 
elect   to   remove   the   action   to   a   small   claims   court   in   the   defendant's   county   of 
residence. A claim may not be filed by an assignee of that claim. A garnishment or 
attachment may not issue from this court until after judgment is entered.

27-08.1-02. Commencement of action - Claim affidavit.
Actions in the small claims court are commenced whenever any person executes and files 
with the court a claim affidavit, and causes the affidavit to be served by a person of legal age, 
not   a  party  to  or   interested  in   the  action,   on  the  defendant   or   mails  it   to  the  defendant   by 
certified mail with restricted delivery along with a form upon which the defendant must indicate 
whether a hearing is requested and whether the defendant elects to remove the action to district 
court. If, within twenty days of service of the affidavit and form, the court has not received a 
request for a hearing or an election to remove to district court, or if the defendant indicates that 
a   hearing   is   not   requested,   a   hearing   will   not   be   scheduled   and   judgment   may  be   entered 
against the defendant by default. If the defendant requests a hearing in small claims court, the 
hearing   must   be   not   less   than   ten   days   and   not   more   than   thirty  days   after   receipt   of   the 
request. Except for an action under  subdivision e of subsection 2  of  section 27-08.1-01,  the 
mailing or personal service may be made anywhere within the state. Forms used in small claims 
court actions must be approved by the state court administrator and obtained from, or at the 
direction of, the clerk of district court or in electronic form from the supreme court.

27-08.1-03. Informal hearing  -  Answer and counterclaim  -  Filing and service fees  - 

Examination of debtor.

No   formal   pleadings   other   than   the   claim   affidavit   and   order   for   appearance   may   be 
required, and the hearing and disposition of actions must be informal. A court reporter is not 
required to be present to take the testimony unless arranged for and paid for by one of the 
parties to the action. The defendant may file an answer, and file a claim affidavit setting forth 
any new matter constituting a counterclaim, not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars, which must 
be served upon the plaintiff by a person of legal age, not a party to or interested in the action, or 
mailed to the plaintiff by certified mail, not later than forty-eight hours before the hearing set for 
the   appearance   of   the   defendant.   The   compulsory   counterclaim   rule   does   not   apply   to 
counterclaims   in   excess   of  fifteen  thousand   dollars.   At   the   hearing,   the   plaintiff   and   the 
defendant may appear without counsel. The court will conduct the proceedings and may make 
its own inquiry before, during, or after the hearing. After the court has found that money is owing 
by any party to the proceeding, the court may, in the presence of the prevailing party, inquire of 
the debtor as to plans for payment of the debt. The court may examine the debtor concerning 
the property owned by the debtor, at the hearing, as would be made under chapter 28-25. The 
examination may be made without first having issued an execution against the property of the 
debtor and without further notice as otherwise provided in chapter 28-25. A trial by jury is not 
allowed in small claims court. A fee as prescribed in subdivision c of subsection 1 of section 
27-05.2-03 must be charged for filing the claim affidavit.

27-08.1-04. Election to proceed in small claims court irrevocable.
Election by the plaintiff to use the procedures provided for in this chapter is irrevocable. In 
the   event   the   plaintiff   elects   to   discontinue   the   proceedings,   the   court   shall   enter   its   order 
accordingly, and unless otherwise provided in the order the dismissal must be deemed to be 
with  prejudice.  By election  to proceed  in  small claims court,  the plaintiff  waives the right  to 
appeal to any other court from the decision of the small claims court. The defendant waives the 
right   to   appeal   from   the   decision   of   the   small   claims   court   upon   receiving   the   order   for 
appearance as required herein, unless the defendant elects to remove the action from the small 
claims court to district court. If the defendant elects to remove the action to district court, the 
defendant must serve upon the plaintiff a notice of the removal and file with the clerk of the court 
to which the action is removed a copy of the claim affidavit and the defendant's answer along 
with the filing fee, except for an answer fee, required for civil actions. If the defendant elects to 
remove   the   action   from   small   claims   court   to   district   court,   the   district   court   shall   award 
attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff.

27-08.1-04.1. Dismissal without prejudice.
If the judge determines at any stage of the proceedings that the case may not be fairly 
disposed   of   in   small   claims   court,   the   judge   may   dismiss   the   case   without   prejudice.   A 
determination that a case may not be fairly disposed of in small claims court must be based on 
complexity of factual or legal issues or a determination that relief other than money damages or 
cancellation of an agreement is necessary to dispose of the case. If a case is dismissed under 
this section, the filing fee must be refunded to the plaintiff.

27-08.1-05. Judgment.
The court shall enter a written judgment indicating its decision on all cases filed with the 
court on the basis of the evidence presented. A judgment must be entered even if either party 
fails to appear at the hearing. The court may award the costs of the action to the prevailing 
party. For purposes of enforcement and execution, a judgment of the small claims court has the 
same force, effects, and attributes of a judgment of the district court.

27-08.1-06. Judgment unsatisfied - Docketing - Execution.
Repealed by S.L. 1997, ch. 263, § 5.

Page No. 2

27-08.1-07. Records and destruction of records.
Unless otherwise authorized by rules of the supreme court, records of the small claims court 
consist of all documents filed in each action and an index for plaintiffs and defendants. Unless 
otherwise directed by rules of the supreme court, after the judgment is satisfied or becomes ten 
years old, the court may destroy all papers filed in the case, except the judgment. At the time of 
destroying the papers, the clerk of court shall make a record upon the judgment identifying the 
papers destroyed and the dates the papers were filed.

27-08.1-08.   Referees   of   small   claims   court  -  Appointment  -  Term  -  Method   of 

qualifying - Powers and duties - Compensation.

The presiding judge of the judicial district may appoint a referee of the small claims court 
who shall hold office at the pleasure of the judge. The referee shall qualify in the same manner 
as other civil officers, except that the referee need not be a qualified elector of the county, and 
the   duties   and   powers   of   the   referee   in   the   conduct   of   trials   in   the   small   claims   court   are 
governed by the provisions of rule 53(c) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure insofar as 
those provisions are not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter. The referee appointed 
must be a person versed in the law. The presiding judge shall determine the salary or fee of the 
referee, within the limits of legislative appropriations.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
