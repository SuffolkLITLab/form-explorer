CLERK OF DISTRICT COURT FUNDING AND FEES

27-05.2-01. Statement of intent.
It   is   the   intent   of   the   legislative   assembly   that   adequate   and   proper   judicial   services, 
including clerk of district court services, be provided in each county in this state. It is also the 
intent of the legislative assembly that funding for clerk of district court services be provided by 
the state judicial system within the limits of legislative appropriations and in cooperation with the 
several boards of county commissioners of the various counties in this state.

services - Transition schedule.

Except as provided in subsection 2, the supreme court, within the limits of legislative 
appropriations   and   pursuant   to   subsection 7,   shall   provide   clerk   of   district   court 
services in each county in the state. The supreme court may provide such services 
through clerks of  district  court,  deputies,  and assistants  who  are employees of the 
judicial system or through service agreements under subsection 6. The supreme court 
shall develop standards and procedures to ensure that adequate clerk of district court 
services   are   provided.   "Clerk   of   district   court   services"   means   those   duties   and 
services, as provided by statute or rule of the supreme court, that directly serve the 
judicial system and the provision of effective and efficient judicial services to the public. 
Beginning   January 1,   2003,   the   individual   designated   by   a   board   of   county 
commissioners   to   provide   clerk   of   district   court   services   under   subsection 2   or 6 
serves as ex officio clerk of district court. The salary and bond for the ex officio clerk of 
district   court   must   be   fixed   by   a   resolution   adopted   by   the   board   of   county 
commissioners.
A  county   may   elect   to   provide   clerk   of   district   court   services   at   the   county's   own 
expense. The board of county commissioners shall forward to the supreme court a 
resolution   indicating   its   election   to   provide   services   under   this   subsection.   Such 
services   must   be   provided   in   a   manner   consistent   with   standards   and   procedures 
established by the supreme court. If the county is unable to provide adequate clerk of 
district   court   services,   the   supreme   court   shall   provide   for   those   services   in   any 
manner  it   considers appropriate.   If   a county has  entered  into  an  agreement   under 
subsection 6,   the  county  may not   provide  clerk  of  district   court   services  under   this 
subsection until after the agreement has expired.
In   a   county   in   which   the   supreme   court   determines   that   at   least   five   full-time 
employees   are   necessary   to   provide   adequate   clerk   of   district   court   services,   the 
elected clerk of district court and clerk of court staff designated by the supreme court 
shall   become   employees   of   the   state   judicial   system   if   the   board   of   county 
commissioners consents to the transition after consultation with the elected clerk. This 
subsection applies upon receipt by the supreme court of a resolution adopted by the 
board   of   county   commissioners   indicating   its   consent.   Any   equipment,   including 
technology-related equipment, and furnishings in the control and custody of the clerk 
of district court on the date the clerk becomes a state employee must remain in the 
control and custody of the clerk until the state court administrator determines the items 
are no longer needed. The clerk, upon becoming a state employee, shall receive a 
salary in an amount not less than the salary received as a county employee and shall 
remain an employee of the state judicial system until the clerk retires, resigns, or the 
term   for   which   the   clerk   was   initially   elected   expires,   whichever   occurs   earlier. 
Thereafter, the clerk of district court must be appointed in the manner provided by 
supreme court rule. If the board of county commissioners does not consent to the clerk 
and designated staff becoming employees of the state judicial system, the county must 
provide   clerk   of   district   court   services   at   its   own   expense   in   accordance   with 
subsection 2.
In a county in which the supreme court determines that one or more, but less than five, 
full-time   employees   are   necessary   to   provide   clerk   of   district   court   services,   the

elected clerk of district court and clerk of court staff designated by the supreme court 
shall   become   employees   of   the   state   judicial   system   in   the   manner   described   in 
subsection 3. If the board of county commissioners does not consent to the clerk and 
designated  staff   becoming   employees   of   the  state  judicial   system,   the  county  may 
provide clerk of district court services at its own expense under subsection 2 or the 
supreme court may provide funding for clerk of district court services in accordance 
with an agreement under subsection 6.
In   a   county   in   which   the   supreme   court   determines   that   less   than   one   full-time 
employee is necessary to provide clerk of district court services, the supreme court 
may   provide   funding   for   such   services   in   accordance   with   an   agreement   under 
subsection 6.
The supreme court may enter into an agreement with one or more boards of county 
commissioners to provide funding for the provision of clerk of district court services in 
a manner consistent with standards and procedures established by the supreme court. 
Funding for personnel under the agreement must be equal to the amount, based on 
county   employee   compensation   levels,   necessary   for   the   number   of   full-time 
employees   needed   to   provide   clerk   of   district   court   services.   Funding   must   be 
available   under   the   agreement   to   defray   the   cost   of   technology-related   equipment 
considered   necessary   by   the   supreme   court   for   the   delivery   of   adequate   clerk   of 
district court services. After entering into an agreement under this subsection, a county 
may, under chapter 11-10.2 or 11-10.3, provide for the delivery of clerk of district court 
services in a manner consistent with the agreement. If a county fails to fulfill the terms 
of an agreement or is unable to provide clerk of district court services consistent with 
standards and procedures established by the supreme court, the supreme court shall 
provide for those services in any manner it considers appropriate.
a.

State funding for the provision of clerk of district court services may be provided 
beginning   January 1,   2001.   Before   April 1,   2000,   each   board   of   county 
commissioners shall notify the supreme court of its election to provide clerk of 
district court services under subsection 2, of its consent to the elected clerk of 
court and designated staff becoming state employees under subsection 3 or 4, or 
of its election to enter into an agreement under subsection 6. If a board of county 
commissioners   elects   to   enter   into   an   agreement   under   subsection 6,   the 
agreement   must   be   executed   before   July 1,   2000.   If   an   agreement   is   not 
executed before that date, the county must provide clerk of district court services 
at its own expense under subsection 2.
Before   April 1,   2002,   and   thereafter   before   April   first   of   each   succeeding 
even-numbered year, each board of county commissioners that has executed an 
agreement under subsection 6 or whose county is providing clerk of district court 
services   under   subsection 2   must   notify   the   supreme   court   of   its   election   to 
continue   the   existing   arrangement   or   initiate   a   different   option.   If   a   board   of 
county commissioners elects to enter into an agreement under subsection 6, the 
agreement must be executed before July first of the year the election is made. If 
an agreement is not executed before that date, the county must provide clerk of 
district court services at its own expense under subsection 2.

an agency thereof or from a political subdivision or agency thereof.

27-05.2-04. Clerk to keep record of fees  -  Monthly report to county auditor or state 

treasurer - Continuing appropriation.

A clerk of the district court providing clerk services in accordance with subsection 2 or 6 of 
section   27-05.2-02   shall   keep   a   public   record   of   all   money   received   as   fees   for   services 
rendered as clerk. Within three days after the close of each calendar month, the clerk shall file 
with the county auditor a statement under oath showing the amount of fees received as clerk 
since the date of the clerk's last report and within three days thereafter the clerk shall deposit 
with the county treasurer the total sum of such fees which must be used for facilities, except 
fees that the clerk is directed to deposit with the state treasurer or is authorized expressly to 
retain. Within three days after the close of each calendar month, a clerk who has become a 
state employee under subsection 3 or 4 of section 27-05.2-02 shall file with the state treasurer a 
statement under oath showing the amount of fees received by the clerk since the date of the 
clerk's last report. Within three days thereafter, the clerk shall deposit with the state treasurer 
the total sum of fees required to be deposited in the general fund or in a designated special 
fund. The clerk shall forward to the county treasurer any fees received under section 27-05.2-03 
which are not required to be deposited in the state general fund or a designated special fund. 
Those fees must be used for facilities. A special court receivables fund is established in the 
state treasury for purposes of depositing any money received by the clerk which is not required 
to be deposited in the state general fund, a different special fund, or the county treasury and 
which is received as bail or restitution, or otherwise received pursuant to an order of the court. 
Moneys in the special fund are appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for 
purposes of refunding bail, forwarding restitution amounts to the entitled recipient, or otherwise 
making payments as directed by an order of the court. To facilitate making payments from the 
special fund, the clerk may establish a special account in the Bank of North Dakota or in a 
banking institution designated as a depository of public funds under chapter 21-04. If money 
deposited as bail is forfeited, the clerk shall submit the appropriate sum to the state treasurer for 
deposit  in the state general fund.  If the clerk is unable to make payments from  the  special 
account because the address of the recipient is unknown or the recipient cannot otherwise be 
located, the clerk shall dispose of the deposited money in accordance with chapter 47-30.2.

27-05.2-05. Decree or judgment of divorce, annulment, or paternity filed with registrar 

of vital statistics.

The clerk of the district court in which any decree or judgment of divorce, annulment of 
marriage, or paternity has been entered shall within fifteen days of the filing thereof notify the 
state registrar of vital statistics of the entry of the decree or judgment of divorce, annulment of 

Page No. 3

marriage, or paternity and shall furnish such information relating thereto as the state registrar 
may require upon such forms as may be furnished by the state registrar.

A clerk of district court shall maintain and dispose of court records in accordance with rules, 

policies, and procedures adopted by the supreme court.

refuses to perform any of the duties of office and any person is injured or aggrieved by such 
violation or neglect, such person may institute legal proceedings upon the bond of the clerk and 
recover double the amount of damages actually sustained. For each such violation or neglect by 
the clerk, the county treasurer shall collect a forfeiture of not less than fifty dollars.

27-05.2-08.   Court   facilities   improvement   and   maintenance   fund  -  Administration  - 

Continuing appropriation.

The   court   facilities   improvement   and   maintenance   fund   is   a   special   fund   in   the   state 
treasury.   The   state   treasurer   shall   deposit   in   the   fund   certain   fees   collected   under   section 
29-26-22. All moneys in the fund are appropriated on a continuing basis to be used as provided 
in this chapter.

27-05.2-10. Application for grants from court facilities improvement and maintenance 

fund.

Moneys in the court facilities improvement and maintenance fund may be used by the court 
facilities improvement advisory committee to make grants to counties to provide funds for court 
facilities  improvement and maintenance projects. The committee shall review applications to 
determine   if   the   purpose   of   a   grant   is   consistent   with   the   purposes   of   the   fund   and   if   the 
proposed   project   is   a   necessary   improvement   to   court   facilities   or   essential   to   remodel   or 
maintain existing court facilities in the applicant county. A grant may be awarded to a county 
only if the applicant county agrees to provide local funding for the project in an amount at least 
equal to twenty-five percent of the total cost of the project. The committee shall ensure that at 

Page No. 4

least twenty-five percent of funds granted during a biennium are allocated to counties with a 
population fewer than seven thousand five hundred. Grants disbursed under this section may be 
used   only   to   improve   or   provide   essential   remodeling   or   maintenance   to   facilities   used   for 
chambers, courts, and court-related services.
