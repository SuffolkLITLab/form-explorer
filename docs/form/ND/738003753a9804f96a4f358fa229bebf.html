      <pre>How to Answer a Request to Add a Co-Guardian to 
Your Guardianship 

 

FIRST, ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS: 

1.  Did a North Dakota court appoint a guardian for you? 

2.  Did your guardian ask the court in writing to appoint, or add, a co-

guardian to your guardianship? 

If you said YES to both questions, this information will help you understand 

how to tell the North Dakota district court if you want a hearing, and what 

you think about adding the co-guardian. 

STEPS FOR ANSWERING A REQUEST TO ADD A CO-GUARDIAN 

Since a North Dakota district court appointed your guardian, only the North Dakota 

district court can make changes to your guardianship. 

In North Dakota, requests to make changes to your guardianship are called “motions.”  
Motions are usually made in writing. 

When your guardian makes a motion to make changes to your guardianship, you may 

tell the district court what you think.  This is called an “answer to the motion.”  Answers 
to motions are usually made in writing. 

You may answer the motion in writing and it send to the district court, but you only 

have 14 days! 

As part of your answer, you may ask the district court to hold a hearing before deciding. 

• 

If you do not want a hearing in front of the court, the district court will decide 

whether to add a co-guardian based on the documents filed by: 

o  Your guardian; 
o  The person who wants to be added as your co-guardian; and 
o  You, if you answer in writing.

Step One – Write Your Answer    

When your guardian makes a motion to the district court to add a co-guardian, you may 

answer in writing to tell court: 

If you want a hearing in front of the court, before the court makes a decision. 

• 
•  What you think about adding the co-guardian. 

Write your answer soon! 

You only have 14 days from the day you got copies of your guardian’s motion! 

If you don’t know which North Dakota district court is in charge of your guardianship, 

look on the first page of the motion documents your guardian gave you. 

The name of the district court and your case number are on the top of the first page. 

You can hand-write or type your answer. 

If you hand-write your answer, make sure you write your words neatly, so your words 

are easy to read. 

In your answer: 

Use a pen that has blue or black ink.  Do not use a pencil. 

You may use the form at the end of these instructions to write your answer. 

•  Type or write the case number for your guardianship. 

•  Type or write your first and last name. 

•  Type or write your current address. 

•  Type or write your current telephone number, if you have one. 

•  Tell the district court if you want a hearing in front of the court before the court 

decides whether to add a co-guardian.

o  If you do not want a hearing in front of the court, the district court will 

decide based on the documents filed by: 

  Your guardian; 
  The person who wants to be added as your co-guardian; and 
  You, if you answer in writing. 

•  Type or write the reasons you want the co-guardian added to your guardianship, 

OR the reasons why you do not want the co-guardian added. 

Sign your first, middle, and last name at the bottom of your answer. 

Write the date you signed your answer next to your signature. 

Print your first, middle, and last name after your signature.  

Step Two – Make a Copy of Your Answer; Keep for Your Records    

Make a copy of your answer, or have someone you trust make a copy for you. 

Step Three – Take or Mail Your Answer to the North Dakota District Court    

You may take your answer in-person to the North Dakota district court that is in charge 

of your guardianship. 

Or, you may have someone you trust take your answer in-person. 

If you or someone you trust can’t get to the court in-person, you may mail your answer. 

Here are some ways to find the phone number and address for a North Dakota district 
court: 

•  Go to www.ndcourts.gov/court-locations and click on the name of the County. 

•  Look for the name of the County in the phone book. 

•  Go to a public library near you and ask how to find the phone number and 

address.

Step Four – Follow the Instructions from the North Dakota District Court    

Wait one week, if you don’t get something in the mail from the North Dakota district 
court, call and ask about your answer. 

After you send your answer to the North Dakota district court, you will get information 

in the mail about your answer. 

you need to do anything else. 

The information you get in the mail from the North Dakota district court will tell you if 

If the North Dakota district court decides to have a hearing, the information you get in 

the mail will tell you when the hearing will be and where the hearing will be. 

If a hearing is scheduled, you MUST go to the hearing in person, unless the court 

decides you do not need to go to the hearing in person. 

You don’t have to hire a lawyer, but you can choose to hire a lawyer to represent you. 

At the hearing, you will have a chance to tell the North Dakota district court what you 

think about adding a co-guardian to your guardianship. 

You can show the North Dakota district court your own proof that you can take care of 

yourself and make good decisions about your life. 

Step Five – The North Dakota District Court Decides if the Co-Guardian Should 

be Added to Your Guardianship 

The North Dakota district court will decide if the co-guardian should be added to your 

guardianship. 

You will get the North Dakota district court decision in the mail. 

If the District Court decides to add the co-guardian, you will have both your current 

guardian and the new co-guardian making decisions about you and your guardianship.

guardian making decisions about you and your guardianship.
