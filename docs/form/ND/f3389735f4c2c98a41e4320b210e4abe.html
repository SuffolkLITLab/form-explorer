      <pre>CHAPTER 14-05
DIVORCE

14-05-01. Marriage - How dissolved.
Marriage is dissolved only:
1.
2.

By the death of one of the parties; or
By a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction decreeing a divorce of the parties.

14-05-02. Effect of divorce.
The   effect   of   a   judgment   decreeing   a   divorce   is   to   restore   the   parties   to   the   state   of 
unmarried persons, but neither party to a divorce may marry except in accordance with the 
decree of the court granting the divorce. It is the duty of the court granting a divorce to specify in 
the order for judgment whether either or both of the parties shall be permitted to marry, and if 
so, when. The court shall have jurisdiction to modify the decree of divorce at any time so as to 
permit one or both of the parties to marry, if the court deems it right.

14-05-02.1. Decree to include social security numbers.
Each   decree   of   divorce   must   include   the   social   security   numbers   of   the   parties   to   the 

divorce.

14-05-03. Causes for divorce.
Divorces may be granted for any of the following causes:
Adultery.
1.
Extreme cruelty.
2.
3. Willful desertion.
4. Willful neglect.
5.
6. Conviction of felony.
7.

Abuse of alcohol or controlled substances.

Irreconcilable differences.

14-05-03.1. Grounds for separation.
The  court   may grant   a  temporary or   permanent  decree  of   separation  for   any  cause  for 

which a divorce may be decreed.

14-05-04. Adultery defined.
Adultery is the voluntary sexual intercourse of a married person with a person other than the 

offender's husband or wife.

14-05-05. Extreme cruelty defined.
Extreme cruelty is the infliction by one party to the marriage of grievous bodily injury or 

grievous mental suffering upon the other.

14-05-06. Desertion defined.
Willful desertion is the voluntary separation of one of the married parties from the other with 

intent to desert:

1.

Persistent refusal to have reasonable matrimonial intercourse as husband and wife 
when health or physical condition does not make such refusal reasonably necessary, 
or the refusal of either party to dwell in the same house with the other party when there 
is no just cause for such refusal, is desertion.

2. When one party is induced by the stratagem or fraud of the other party to leave the 
family dwelling place or to be absent, and during such absence the offending party 
departs   with   intent   to   desert   the   other,   it   is   desertion   by  the   party  committing   the 
stratagem or fraud and not by the other.

Page No. 1

3. Departure or absence of one party from the family dwelling place caused by cruelty or 
by threats of bodily harm from which danger reasonably would be apprehended from 
the other is not desertion by the absent party, but it is desertion by the other party.
Separation by consent, with or without the understanding that one of the parties will 
apply for a divorce, is not desertion.
Absence   or   separation,   proper   in   itself,   becomes   desertion   whenever   the   intent   to 
desert is fixed during such absence or separation.

5.

4.

7.

6. Consent to a separation is a revocable act, and if one of the parties afterwards in good 
faith  seeks a reconciliation and  restoration  but  the  other  refuses  it,  such  refusal  is 
desertion.
If one party deserts the other and before the expiration of the statutory period required 
to make the desertion a cause of divorce returns and offers in good faith to fulfill the 
marriage contract and solicits condonation, the desertion is cured. If the other party 
refuses   such   offer   and   condonation,   the   refusal   must   be   deemed   and   treated   as 
desertion by such party from the time of the refusal.

14-05-07. Willful neglect defined.
Willful neglect is the failure of either spouse to provide for the common necessaries of life 
for the other party, when that spouse has the ability to do so and the party alleging neglect does 
not  have  the  ability,   or  when a  spouse fails to  provide  by  reason of  idleness,  profligacy,   or 
dissipation.

14-05-08. Abuse of alcohol or controlled substances defined.
Abuse   of   alcohol   or   controlled   substances   is   that   degree   of   use   which   disqualifies   the 
person  a  great  portion of  the  time  from  properly  attending to business or  which reasonably 
would inflict a course of great mental anguish upon the innocent party. For purposes of this 
chapter, "controlled substance" means a substance as defined in section 19-03.1-01.

14-05-08.1.   Recognition   of   foreign   decree   of   divorce   and   foreign   annulment   of 

marriage.

A decree of divorce or of annulment of marriage obtained in a court of another jurisdiction is 
of no force or effect in this state, if the parties to the marriage were domiciled in this state at the 
time such decree was rendered.

If a person obtains a decree of divorce or of annulment of marriage from a court of another 
jurisdiction and was domiciled in this state within less than twelve months prior to obtaining the 
decree and resumes residence in this state within six months after obtaining the decree, it is 
prima facie evidence that such person did not abandon the person's domicile in this state prior 
to obtaining the decree.

The provisions of this section do not apply to any divorce or annulment of marriage obtained 

in proceedings begun prior to the passage of this section.

14-05-09. Desertion, neglect, intemperance - Duration.
Willful desertion, willful neglect, or habitual intemperance must continue for one year before 

either is a ground for a divorce.

14-05-09.1. Irreconcilable differences defined.
Irreconcilable   differences   are   those   grounds   which   are   determined   by   the   court   to   be 
substantial reasons for not continuing the marriage and which make it appear that the marriage 
should be dissolved.

14-05-10. Denial of divorce.
Divorces must be denied upon showing:
1. Condonation; or
2.

Limitation and lapse of time.

Page No. 2

14-05-11. Connivance defined.
Repealed by S.L. 2001, ch. 149, § 13.

14-05-12. Collusion defined.
Repealed by S.L. 2001, ch. 149, § 13.

14-05-13. Condonation defined - Requisites.
Condonation is the conditional forgiveness of a matrimonial offense constituting a cause of 

divorce. The following requirements are necessary to condonation:

A knowledge on the part of the condoner of the facts constituting the cause of divorce;

1.
2. Reconciliation and remission of the offense by the injured party; and
3. Restoration of the offending party to all marital rights.

Condonation   implies   a   condition   subsequent   that   the   forgiving   party   must   be   treated   with 
conjugal kindness. When the cause of divorce consists of a course of offensive conduct, or 
arises in cases of cruelty from successive acts of ill treatment, which aggregately may constitute 
the offense, cohabitation, or passive endurance, or conjugal kindness shall not be evidence of 
condonation of any of the acts constituting such cause, unless accompanied by an express 
agreement to condone. In such cases, condonation can be made only after the cause of divorce 
has become complete as to the acts complained of. A fraudulent concealment by the condonee 
of facts constituting a different cause of divorce from the one condoned and existing at the time 
of condonation avoids such condonation.

14-05-14. Revocation of condonation.
Condonation is revoked and the original cause of divorce revived:
1. When the condonee commits acts constituting a like or other cause of divorce; or
2. When the condonee is guilty of great conjugal unkindness, not amounting to a cause 
of   divorce,   but   sufficiently   habitual   and   gross   to   show   that   the   conditions   of 
condonation had not been accepted in good faith or not fulfilled.

14-05-15. Recrimination defined.
Repealed by S.L. 1963, ch. 127, § 2.

14-05-16. Limitation of time.
A   divorce   must   be   denied   when   there   is   an   unreasonable   lapse   of   time   before   the 
commencement of the action. Unreasonable lapse of time is such a delay in commencing the 
action   as   establishes   the   presumption   that   there   has   been   connivance,   collusion,   or 
condonation   of   the   offense,   or   full   acquiescence   in   the   same,   with   intent   to   continue   the 
marriage relation, notwithstanding the commission of the offense set up as a ground of divorce. 
The presumption arising from lapse of time may be rebutted by showing reasonable grounds for 
the delay in commencing the action. There are no limitations of time for commencing actions for 
divorce, except such as are contained in this section.

14-05-17. Residence requirements.
A separation or divorce may not be granted unless the plaintiff in good faith has been a 
resident of the state for six months next preceding commencement of the action. If the plaintiff 
has not been a resident of this state for the six months preceding commencement of the action, 
a separation or divorce may be granted if the plaintiff in good faith has been a resident of this 
state for the six months immediately preceding entry of the decree of separation or divorce.

14-05-18. Presumption of domicile.
In   actions   for   divorce,   the   presumption   of   law   that   the   domicile   of   the   husband   is   the 
domicile of the wife does not apply. After separation, each party may have a separate domicile, 
depending for proof upon actual residence and not upon legal presumptions.

Page No. 3

14-05-19. Affirmative proof required.
Repealed by S.L. 1971, ch. 150, § 1.

14-05-20. Legitimacy of children - Adultery by husband.
When a divorce is granted for the adultery of the husband, the legitimacy of children of the 

marriage begotten of the wife before the commencement of the action is not affected.

14-05-21. Legitimacy of children - Adultery by wife.
When a divorce is granted for the adultery of the wife, the legitimacy of children begotten of 
her before the commission of the adultery is not affected, but the legitimacy of other children of 
the wife may be determined by the court upon the evidence in the case. In every such case, all 
children begotten before the commencement of the action are to be presumed legitimate until 
the contrary is shown.

14-05-22. Parental rights and responsibilities - Costs.
1.

In an action for divorce, the court, before or after judgment, may give direction for 
parenting rights and responsibilities of the children of the marriage and may vacate or 
modify the same at any time. Any award or change of primary parental responsibilities 
must be made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 14-09.
After making an award of primary residential responsibility, the court, upon request of 
the other parent, shall grant such rights of parenting time as will enable the child to 
maintain a parent-child relationship that will be beneficial to the child, unless the court 
finds, after  a hearing,  that  such rights of  parenting time are likely to endanger  the 
child's physical or emotional health.

2.

14-05-23. Temporary support, attorney's fees, and parental rights and responsibilities.
During any time in which an action for separation or divorce is pending, the court, upon 
application of a party, may issue an order requiring a party to pay such support as may be 
necessary for the support of a party and minor children of the parties and for the payment of 
attorney's   fees.  The   court   in   the   order   may   make   an   order   concerning   parental   rights   and 
responsibilities concerning the children of the parties. The order may be issued and served in 
accordance   with   the   North   Dakota   Rules   of   Court.   The   court   may   include   in   the   order   a 
provision for domestic violence protection provided the party has submitted a verified application 
for the order which is sufficient to meet the criteria defined in subsection 2 of section 14-07.1-01. 
A  violation of  the  protection provision of  the order  is  subject  to the penalties established  in 
section 14-07.1-06 and the arrest procedures authorized in section 14-07.1-11.

14-05-24. Division of property and debts.
1. When   a   divorce   is   granted,   the   court   shall   make   an   equitable   distribution   of   the 
property and debts of the parties. Except as may be required by federal law for specific 
property, the valuation date for marital property and debt is the date mutually agreed 
upon between the parties. If the parties do not mutually agree upon a valuation date, 
the   valuation   date   for   marital   property   and   debt   is  sixty   days   before   the   initially 
scheduled   trial   date.   If   there   is   a   substantial   change   in   value   of   an   asset   or   debt 
between the date of valuation and the date of trial, the court may adjust the valuation 
of that asset or debt as necessary to effect an equitable distribution and shall make 
specific findings that another date of valuation is fair and equitable.
If one party to the divorce is covered by the civil service retirement system or other 
government pension system in lieu of social security and is not entitled to receive full 
social security benefits and the other party is a social security recipient, in making an 
equitable distribution award, the court shall compute what the present value of the 
social security benefits would have been to the party with the government pension 
during the covered period and subtract that amount from the value of the government 
pension in order to determine the government pension's marital portion.

2.

Page No. 4

3.

The court may redistribute property and debts in a postjudgment proceeding if a party 
has failed to disclose property and debts as required by rules adopted by the supreme 
court or the party fails to comply with the terms of a court order distributing property 
and debts.

14-05-24.1. Spousal support.
1.

Taking into consideration the circumstances of the parties, the court may require one 
party   to   pay   spousal   support   to   the   other   party   for  a   limited  period   of   time  in 
accordance with this section. The court may modify its spousal support orders.

2. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, spousal support is terminated 
upon the remarriage of the spouse receiving support. Immediately upon remarriage, 
the   spouse   receiving   support   shall   provide   notice   of   the   remarriage   to   the   payor 
spouse at the last known address of the payor spouse.

3. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, upon an order of the court based 
upon a preponderance of the evidence that the spouse receiving support has been 
habitually cohabiting with another individual in a relationship analogous to a marriage 
for one year or more, the court shall terminate spousal support.
Subsections 2 and 3 do not apply to rehabilitative spousal support.

4.

2.

14-05-24.2. Summary real estate disposition judgment.
1.

If real estate is described in a judgment and decree of divorce, the court may direct 
either of the parties or their legal counsel to prepare and submit to the court, in a form 
prescribed by the court, a proposed summary real estate disposition judgment. Upon 
approval by the court and filing of the summary real estate disposition judgment with 
the clerk of court, the clerk of court shall provide to any party upon request certified 
copies of the summary real estate disposition judgment.
A summary real estate disposition judgment must contain the following information:
a.

The full caption and file number of the case and the title "Summary Real Estate 
Disposition Judgment";
The dates of the parties' marriage and of the entry of the judgment and decree of 
divorce;
The names of the parties' attorneys or if either or both appeared pro se;
The name of the judge and referee, if any, who signed the order for judgment and 
decree;

c.
d.

b.

e. Whether the judgment and decree resulted from a stipulation, a default, or a trial 

and the appearances at the default or trial;
If the judgment and decree resulted from a stipulation, whether the real property 
was described by a legal description;
If the judgment and decree resulted from a default, whether the petition contained 
the   legal   description   of   the   property   and   whether   disposition   was   made   in 
accordance with the request for relief;

h. Whether the summons and petition were served personally upon the respondent 

in accordance with the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure;
If the summons and petition were served on the respondent only by publication, 
the name of each legal newspaper and county in which the summons and petition 
were published and the dates of publications;

j. Whether either party changed the party's name through the judgment and decree;
k.
l.

The legal description of each parcel of real estate;
The name or names of the persons awarded an interest in each parcel of real 
estate and a description of the interest awarded;
Liens, mortgages, encumbrances, or other interests in the real estate described 
in the judgment and decree; and
Triggering or contingent events set forth in the judgment and decree affecting the 
disposition of each parcel of real estate.

n.

3.

a. On the court's own motion or on application by an interested person, the court 
shall issue an order authorizing the clerk of court to issue an amended summary 

Page No. 5

real estate disposition judgment to correct an erroneous legal description of real 
estate contained in the judgment and decree of divorce.
An application to correct a legal description under this subdivision must contain:
(1) The erroneous legal description contained in the judgment and decree;
(2) The correct legal description of the real estate;
(3) Written   evidence   satisfactory   to   the   court   to   show   the   correct   legal 
description, or a request for an evidentiary hearing to produce evidence of 
the correct legal description; and

(4) A proposed amended summary real estate disposition judgment.
The court shall consider an application under this subsection on an expedited 
basis.   The   court's   order   must   be   based   on   the   evidence   provided   in   the 
application,   the  evidence  produced   at   an  evidentiary  hearing,   or   the   evidence 
already in the record of the proceeding. If the court is satisfied that an erroneous 
legal description should be corrected under this subsection, the court may issue 
its order without a hearing or notice to any person. A filing fee is not required for 
an application under this subsection. The court's order must be treated as an 
amendment of the court's findings of fact regarding the legal description of the 
property   in   question,   without   the   need   to   amend   the   original   judgment   and 
decree. The court shall issue the order if the court specifically finds that the court 
had   jurisdiction   over   the   respondent   in   the  divorce  proceeding   and   that   the 
property was sufficiently identified in the original proceedings to prevent prejudice 
to   the   rights   of   either   party   to   the   divorce   and   that   the   amendment   will   not 
prejudice their rights. The court's order is effective retroactive to the date of entry 
of the original judgment and decree of divorce.
An amended summary real estate disposition judgment must be treated the same 
as the prior summary real estate disposition judgment for all purposes.

b.

c.

d.

e. On request by any interested person, the clerk of court shall provide a certified 
copy   of   an   amended   summary   real   estate   disposition   judgment   showing   the 
correct legal description of the real property affected by the judgment and decree.
This  subsection   may  not   be  used   to  add  omitted  property  to  a  judgment   and 
decree of  divorce, unless the court determines that the omitted property is an 
integral   or   appurtenant   part   of   real   property   already   properly   included   in   the 
judgment and decree.

f.

An order or provision in a judgment and decree that provides that the judgment and 
decree must be recorded in the office of the county recorder means, if a summary real 
estate disposition judgment has been approved by the court, that the summary real 
estate disposition judgment, rather than the judgment and decree, must be recorded in 
the office of the county recorder.
The summary real estate disposition judgment operates as a conveyance and transfer 
of each interest in the real estate in the manner and to the extent described in the 
summary   real   estate   disposition   judgment.   A   summary   real   estate   disposition 
judgment, or an amended summary real estate disposition judgment that supersedes 
an earlier judgment, is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the summary real 
estate disposition judgment. A purchaser for value without notice of any defect in the 
divorce proceedings may rely on a summary real estate disposition judgment or a later 
amended summary real estate disposition judgment to establish the facts stated in the 
judgment.
If a conflict exists between the judgment and decree and the summary real estate 
disposition judgment, the summary real estate disposition judgment recorded in the 
office of the county recorder controls as to the interest acquired in real estate by any 
subsequent   purchaser   in   good   faith   and   for   a   valuable   consideration,   who   is   in 
possession   of   the   interest   or   whose   interest   is   recorded   with   the   county   recorder, 
before the recording of the judgment and decree in the office of the county recorder.

14-05-24.3. Property and debt listing information confidential - Exception.
1.

Except as provided in subsections 2 and 3, the property and debt listing of the parties 
to a divorce which is filed with the court or included in a judgment for divorce is a 
confidential record.

3.

2. Upon providing written notice to all parties, any person may file a motion, supported by 
affidavit showing good cause, for access to the property and debt listing contained in a 
judgment for divorce.
The court shall allow access to the property and debt listing, or relevant portions of the 
information,  if the court finds the public interest in granting access or the personal 
interest of the person seeking access outweighs the privacy interests of the parties or 
the parties' dependent children. In granting access the court may impose conditions 
necessary to balance the interests consistent with this subsection.

14-05-25. Security for alimony - Disposition of homestead.
The court may require either party to give reasonable security for providing maintenance or 
making any payments required under the provisions of this chapter and may enforce the same 
by appointment of a receiver or by any other remedy applicable to the case. When either the 
husband or the wife has a separate estate sufficient to give a proper support, the court in its 
discretion may withhold any allowance to that person out of the separate property of the other 
spouse. The court, in rendering the decree of divorce, may assign the homestead or such part 
thereof as to the court may seem just, to the innocent party, either absolutely or for a limited 
period,   according   to   the   facts   in   the   case   and   in   consonance   with   the   law   relating   to 
homesteads.   The   disposition   of   the   homestead   by   the   court,   and   all   orders   and   decrees 
touching   the   alimony   and   maintenance   of   either   party   to   a   marriage   and   for   the   custody, 
education,   and   support   of   the   children   are   subject   to   revision   on   appeal   in   all   particulars, 
including those which are stated to be in the discretion of the court.

14-05-25.1. Money judgment to secure division of property enforceable by contempt 

proceedings - Exemptions from process not available.

Failure   to   comply   with   the   provisions   of   a   separation   or   divorce   decree   relating   to 
distribution of the property of the parties constitutes contempt of court. A party may also execute 
on a money judgment, and the obligor is entitled only to the absolute exemptions from process 
set forth in section 28-22-02.

14-05-25.2. Enforcement of support order.
Any order or judgment for the support of a spouse or former spouse entered under this 
chapter may be enforced by any means permitted under section 459 of the Social Security Act 
[Pub. L. 93-647; 88 Stat. 2357; 42 U.S.C. 659] and not forbidden under title 32. Any such order 
or judgment may also be enforced in any manner provided for the enforcement of an order for 
the payment of child support under chapter 14-09 to the fullest extent permitted under section 
459 of the Social Security Act [Pub. L. 93-647; 88 Stat. 2357; 42 U.S.C. 659]. For purposes of 
enforcement under chapter 14-09, the order for support of a spouse or former spouse must be 
treated as though it were an order for child support.

14-05-26. Separate maintenance provided for when divorce denied.
Though a judgment of divorce is denied, the court in an action for divorce may provide for 

the maintenance of one spouse by the other and the maintenance of any or all children.

14-05-27. Separation - Spousal support - Division of property.
Upon the granting of a separation, the court may include in the decree an order requiring a 
party to pay for spousal support and for the support of any minor children of the parties. Subject 
to section 14-05-24, the decree may also provide for the equitable division of the property and 
debts of the parties.

14-05-28. Decree of separation - Effect.
The decree of separation confers upon the parties all the rights of property, business, and 
contracts as if unmarried and releases both parties from all obligations of maintenance, except 
as may be required by the decree.

14-05-29. Revocation of decree of separation - Divorce granted.
At   any   time   after   a   decree   for   separation   has   been   granted,   the   court   may  revoke   the 
decree based upon any regulations or restrictions the court imposed in the decree. Application 
for revocation may be made by either party to the decree. The party making the application for 
revocation shall provide to the other party to the decree at least ten days' and not more than 
twenty days' notice of the application. Service must be made in the same manner as service of 
a  summons in a civil action. If it appears to the court at the hearing of the application that 
reconciliation   between   the   parties   to   the  marriage   is   improbable,   the   court   shall   revoke  the 
separation decree and, in lieu of that decree, shall render a decree divorcing the parties. If the 
court   has   not   previously   done   so,   the   court   shall   provide   for   the   equitable   division   of   the 
property, shall make orders with respect to any minor children, and may provide for the payment 
of support to either party by the other.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
