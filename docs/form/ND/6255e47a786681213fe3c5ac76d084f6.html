Wait 30 days from the date of service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment: 

You must wait 30 days from the date of service of the Notice of Entry of Judgment before you

You may need to take additional steps to get your money.  If the losing party does not pay the 
judgment voluntarily, North Dakota law provides a number of judgment collection options.  
Following are some of the judgment collection options allowed by North Dakota law: 

•  Writ of Execution: A court order to a sheriff to seize non-exempt property of the losing 

• 

party in order to satisfy the judgment. 
Judgment Lien Against Real Property: the judgment is a lien against all North Dakota real 
property (real estate), except the homestead, of the losing party. 

•  Garnishment: The act of taking the wages of the losing party in order to satisfy the 

judgment.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
