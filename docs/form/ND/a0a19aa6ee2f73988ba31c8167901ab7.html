      <pre>CHAPTER 32-22
HABEAS CORPUS

32-22-01. Persons restrained may prosecute the writ.
Every person imprisoned or restrained of the person's liberty under any pretense whatever 
may   prosecute   a   writ   of   habeas   corpus   to   inquire   into   the   cause   of   such   imprisonment   or 
restraint and thereby, except in the cases specified in section 32-22-02, obtain relief from such 
imprisonment or restraint if it is unlawful.

32-22-02. Who not entitled to relief.
The   person   in   whose   behalf   the   application   is   made   is   not   entitled   to   relief   from 
imprisonment or restraint under a writ of habeas corpus, if the time during which such person 
may be detained legally in custody has not expired, whenever it appears:

That the person is detained in custody by virtue of process issued by any court or 
judge   of   the   United   States   in   a   case   where   such   court   or   judge   has   exclusive 
jurisdiction; or
Except   as   provided  in   section   32-22-17,   that   the  person  is   detained   in  custody  by 
virtue of the final order or judgment of any competent court of criminal jurisdiction or of 
any process issued upon such order or judgment.

32-22-03. Application for writ - Contents - Verification.
Application for the writ must be made by petition signed either by the person for whose relief 

it is intended or by some person in that person's behalf, and must specify:

That the person in whose behalf the writ is applied for is imprisoned or restrained of 
the   person's   liberty,   the   officer   or   person   by   whom   the   person   is   so   confined   or 
restrained, and the place where, naming all the parties if they are known, or describing 
them if they are not known.
The cause or pretense of such confinement or restraint according to the knowledge or 
belief of the party verifying the petition.
If the confinement or restraint is by virtue of any warrant, order, or process, a copy 
thereof shall be annexed, or it shall be averred because such person was removed or 
concealed before application, a demand of such copy could not be made, or that such 
demand was made and the legal fees therefor tendered to the officer or person having 
such person in custody, and that such copy was refused.
If the imprisonment is alleged to be illegal, the petition shall state in what the illegality 
consists.

The petition must be verified by the oath or affirmation of the person making the application.

32-22-04. By what court application granted.
The writ of habeas corpus must be granted, issued, and made returnable as hereinafter 

stated:
1.

The writ must be granted by the supreme court, or any judge thereof, upon petition by 
or on behalf of any person restrained of the person's liberty within this state. When 
granted by the court, it, in all cases, shall be issued out of and under the seal of the 
supreme   court,   and   may  be   made   returnable,   either   before   the   supreme   court,   or 
before the district court or any judge of the district court; or
The writ may be granted, issued, and determined by the district courts and the judges 
thereof upon petition by or on behalf of any person restrained of the person's liberty in 
their respective districts.

When application is made to the supreme court, or to a judge thereof, proof by the oath of the 
person applying or other sufficient evidence shall be required that the judge of the district court 
having jurisdiction by the provisions of subsection 2 is absent from the judge's district or has 
refused to grant such writ, or for some cause to be specially set forth, is incapable of acting, and 
if such proof is not produced the application shall be denied.

32-22-05. When court must grant the writ.
The court authorized to grant the writ to whom a petition therefor is presented, if it appears 
that the writ ought to issue, must grant the same without delay, and the writ shall not be denied 
for any informality in the petition or for any want of matters of substance, if the same can be 
supplied, and the court to whom application is made, must point out the matters wanting and 
direct the manner of supplying the same.

32-22-06. Application to supreme court for writ of habeas corpus.
When, upon application to the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus, it is apparent that 
no   necessity   exists   for   its   immediate   issuance,   and   a   district   court   has   entertained   an 
application for the writ, and, upon hearing, quashed it, the supreme court will require all the 
papers, including the application and supporting affidavits, the return and supporting affidavits, 
and   the   order   of   such   lower   court,   to   accompany   the   application   made   to   said   court.   In 
emergency cases, the foregoing requirement may be waived.

32-22-07. Direction of writ.
The writ  must be directed to the person having custody of or restraining the person on 
whose behalf the application is made, and must command that person to have the person in 
custody or restraint personally appear before the court before whom the writ is returnable, at a 
place   therein   specified,   immediately   or   at   some   specified   time,   regard   being   had   to   the 
circumstances and the distance to be traveled.

32-22-08. Writ of habeas corpus - Form.
Every   writ   of   habeas   corpus   issued   under   the   provisions   of   this   chapter   shall   be   in 

The state of North Dakota to the sheriff of _________ etc. (or to _________):
You   are   hereby   commanded   to   have   _______________   by   you   imprisoned   and 
detained,   as   is   alleged,   together   with   the   time   and   cause   of   such   imprisonment   and 
detention, by whatever name the said _______________ shall be called or charged, before 
_______________, judge of the district court, (or before the district or supreme court, as 
the case may be), at _______________ (naming the place), on _______________ (naming 
the date), (or immediately upon the receipt of this writ), to do and receive what shall then 
and there be considered concerning the said _______________, and have you then and 
there this writ.

Witness, etc.

Such writ must be endorsed "By the Habeas Corpus Act", and if issued by the court, it shall be 
under the seal of the court, and if by the judge, it shall be under the judge's hand.

32-22-09. Manner of serving the writ.
Whenever the writ is directed to the sheriff or other ministerial officer of the court out of 
which it is issued, it must be delivered by the clerk or by such person as it may be entrusted to, 
without delay, as other writs are delivered to such sheriff or other officer for service, or it may be 
left with the jailer, keeper, or other person under such sheriff or other officer in charge of and at 
the jail or place where the person seeking the writ may be imprisoned or restrained. If it is 
directed to any other person, it may be delivered to the sheriff or sheriff's deputy and be by the 
sheriff   or   sheriff's   deputy  served   upon   such   person   by  delivering   the   same   to   such   person 
without delay. If the person to whom the writ is directed cannot be found or refuses admittance 
to the officer or person serving or delivering such writ, it may be served or delivered by leaving it 
at the residence of the person to whom it is directed, or by affixing it to some conspicuous place 
on the outside either of that person's dwelling house or of the place where the party is confined 
or under restraint. In any case the court issuing the writ, at its discretion, may authorize any 
person to serve and deliver it by an entry signed by the judge thereon to the following effect: "I 

  ss.

) )

substantially the following form:
State of North Dakota

County of _______________ )

Page No. 2

hereby authorize _______________ to serve the within writ", and service made by such person 
in the manner designated in this section shall be due and lawful service.

32-22-10. Penalty if officer refuses to execute and return writ.
If the person to whom the writ is directed refuses, after service, to obey the same, the court, 
upon affidavit stating such facts, must issue an attachment against such person, directed to the 
sheriff or coroner, commanding the sheriff or coroner forthwith to arrest such person and bring 
such person immediately before such court, and upon being so brought that person must be 
committed to the jail of the county until that person makes due return to such writ or is otherwise 
legally discharged. The person disobeying such writ also shall forfeit to the person imprisoned 
or restrained a sum not exceeding five hundred dollars to be recovered in a civil action by the 
person restrained. If the person disobeying the writ is an officer, that officer shall be incapable of 
holding or executing that office.

32-22-11. What the return must set forth.
The person upon whom the writ is served must state in the person's return, plainly and 

unequivocally:

3.

4.

1. Whether that person has or has not the party in custody or under power or restraint.
2.

If that person has the party in custody or power or under restraint, that person must 
state the authority and cause of such imprisonment or restraint.
If the party is detained by virtue of any writ, warrant, or other written authority, a copy 
thereof must be annexed to the return and the original produced and exhibited to the 
court on the hearing of such return.
If the person upon whom the writ is served had the party in the person's custody or 
power or under the person's restraint, at any time prior or subsequent to the date of 
the writ of habeas corpus, but has transferred such custody or restraint to another, the 
return must state particularly to whom, at what time and place, for what cause, and by 
what authority such transfer took place.
The return must be signed by the person making the same, and, except when such 
person is a sworn public officer and makes such return in an official capacity, it must 
be verified by the officer's oath or affirmation.

5.

32-22-12. Party restrained must be brought into court - Exception.
The person to whom the writ is directed, if it is served, must bring the party in custody or 
under   restraint,   according   to   the   command   of   the  writ,   except   in   cases  specified   in   section 
32-22-13.

32-22-13. When party need not be brought.
When from sickness or infirmity of the person directed to be produced such person cannot 
be brought before the court without danger, the person in whose power or custody such person 
is may state that fact in the return to the writ, verifying the same by affidavit. If the court is 
satisfied of the truth of such return and the return to the writ is otherwise sufficient, the court 
may proceed to decide on such return and to dispose of the matter as if such party had been 
produced on the writ, or the hearing thereof may be adjourned until such party can be produced.

32-22-14. When hearing must be had.
The court before whom the writ is returned, immediately after the return or within five days 
thereafter, must proceed to hear and examine the return, and such other matters as may be 
properly submitted for its consideration.

32-22-15. Return may be controverted - Proofs.
The party brought before the court on the return of the writ may deny or controvert any of 
the material facts or matters set forth in the return, or except to the sufficiency thereof, or allege 
any fact to show either that the imprisonment or detention is unlawful or that the party is entitled 
to be discharged. The court thereupon must proceed in a summary way to hear such proof as 

Page No. 3

may  be   produced   against   such   imprisonment   or   detention,   or   in   favor   of   the   same,   and   to 
dispose of such party as the justice of the case may require, and has full power and authority to 
require and compel the attendance of witnesses, by process of subpoena and attachment, and 
to   do   and   perform   all   other   acts   and   things   necessary   to   a   full   and   fair   hearing   and 
determination of the case. The court may allow the return to be amended according to the facts 
of the case, whenever it may be deemed necessary.

32-22-16. When person restrained must be discharged.
If no legal cause is shown for the imprisonment or restraint or for the continuation thereof, 

the court must discharge the party from the custody or restraint under which the party is held.

32-22-17. Causes for discharge of person restrained.
If it appears on the return of the writ that the party is in custody by virtue of process from 
any court of this state, or any judge or officer thereof, such person may be discharged in any of 
the following cases, subject to the restrictions of section 32-22-02:

1. When the jurisdiction of such court or officer has been exceeded.
2. When the imprisonment was at first lawful, but by some act, omission, or event which 

has taken place afterward, the party has become entitled to a discharge.

3. When the process is defective in some matter of substance required by law rendering 

4. When the process, though regular in form, has been issued in a case not allowed by 

5. When the person having the custody of the party is not the person allowed by law to 

6. When the process is not authorized by any order or judgment of any court nor by any

detain the party.

provisions of law.

probable cause.

8. When the process appears to have been obtained by false pretense or bribery.

32-22-18. Informal commitment from district judge.
If the person is committed to prison, or is in custody of an officer on a criminal charge, by 
virtue of a warrant of commitment of a district judge, the person must not be discharged on the 
ground of any mere defect of form in the warrant of commitment.

32-22-19. Procedure when person appears to be guilty.
If it appears to the court, by affidavit or otherwise, or upon inspection of the process or 
warrant of commitment and proceedings as may be shown to the court, that the party is guilty of 
a criminal offense or ought not to be discharged, such court, although the charge is defectively 
or   not   substantially   set   forth   in   such   process   or   warrant   of   commitment,   must   cause   the 
complainant or other necessary witness to be subpoenaed to attend at such time as ordered, to 
testify before the court, and upon the examination the judge may discharge such party, admit 
the party to bail if the offense is bailable, or recommit the party to custody, as may be just and 
legal.

32-22-20. Habeas corpus to give bail.
Whenever a person is imprisoned or detained in custody on a criminal charge, for want of 
bail, such person is  entitled to a writ  of habeas corpus for the purpose of giving bail,  upon 
averring that fact in such person's petition, without alleging that the person is confined illegally. 
Any judge in or out of the court in which the judge is authorized to act may take an undertaking 
of bail from any person who has been committed on a criminal charge, when brought before the 
judge on  a writ  of  habeas  corpus,  as in  other  cases,  if  the  offense  is bailable,  and file the 
undertaking in the proper court.

Page No. 4

32-22-21. Procedure when person not entitled to discharge.
If a party brought before the court on the return of the writ is not entitled to a discharge, and 
is not admitted to bail or bailed when allowable, the court must remand the party to custody, or 
place the party under the restraint from which the party was taken, if the person under whose 
custody or restraint the party was is legally entitled thereto.

32-22-22. Prisoner may be ordered to custody of proper officer.
In cases in which any party is held under illegal restraint or custody, and any other person is 
entitled to the custody or restraint of such party, the court may order such party to be committed 
to the custody or restraint of such person as by law is entitled thereto.

32-22-23. How person disposed of before judgment.
Until judgment is given on the return, the court before whom any party may be brought on 
such writ may commit the party to the sheriff of the county or place the party in such care or 
under such custody as the party's age or circumstances may require.

32-22-24. When notice of hearing must be given state's attorney.
When it appears that the person in whose behalf a writ of habeas corpus is issued is held 
upon a criminal charge of any kind, notice of the time and place of the hearing upon the return 
shall be given to the state's attorney of the county where the offense arose if the person is within 
the state's attorney's county. In other cases, like notice shall be given to any person interested 
in continuing the custody or restraint of the party asking aid of such writ.

32-22-25. Person taken out of county - Expenses.
Whenever the officer or person to whom a writ of habeas corpus is directed and delivered is 
required thereby to make return and take the person in whose behalf the writ is issued into a 
county   other   than   the   county   in   which   such   person   is   imprisoned   or   restrained,   the   court 
awarding the writ, at the court's discretion, may ascertain, and by an entry thereon specifying 
the amount, but not exceeding fifteen cents per mile, may require the payment or tender, at the 
time of delivering the writ, of the charges of obeying the same. However, in no case when an 
entry is not made can the payment or tender of such charges be demanded before the return of 
the writ in accordance with its direction.

32-22-26. Writ must not be disobeyed.
No  writ   of   habeas  corpus   can  be  disobeyed   for   defect   of   form,   if   it   sufficiently  appears 
therefrom in whose restraint the party imprisoned or restrained is, the officer or person detaining 
the party, and the court before whom the party is to be brought.

32-22-27. When person discharged may be arrested again.
No person who has been discharged by the order of the court upon habeas corpus can be 

imprisoned again or kept in custody for the same cause, except in any of the following cases:

1.

2.

3.

If the person has been discharged from custody on a criminal charge and is committed 
afterwards for the same offense, by legal order or process.
If, after a discharge for defect of proof, or for any defect of the process, warrant, or 
commitment in a criminal action, the accused is arrested again on sufficient proof and 
committed by legal process for the same offense.
If   in   a   civil   action   the   party   has   been   discharged   for   any   illegality   in   the   order, 
judgment, or process and afterwards is imprisoned by legal process for the same claim 
for relief.

32-22-28. How obedience to order of discharge enforced.
Obedience to an order for the discharge of any person, granted pursuant to the provisions 
of this chapter, may be enforced by the court or judge issuing such writ, or granting such order, 
by attachment, in the same manner as hereinbefore provided for a neglect to make a return to a 
writ   of   habeas   corpus,   and   the   person  guilty  of   such   disobedience   shall   forfeit   to   the   party 

Page No. 5

aggrieved   five   hundred   dollars,   in   addition   to   any   special   damages   such   party   may   have 
sustained.

32-22-29. Person restrained in danger of being taken out of jurisdiction - Warrant.
When it appears to any court authorized by law to issue the writ of habeas corpus that 
anyone is illegally held in custody, confinement, or restraint, and that there is reason to believe 
that the person will be carried out of the jurisdiction of the court, or will suffer some irreparable 
injury before compliance with the writ of habeas corpus can be enforced, the court may cause a 
warrant   to   be   issued   reciting   the   facts   and   directed   to  the   sheriff   or   coroner   of   the   county, 
commanding the officer to take the person thus held in custody, confinement, or restraint, and 
forthwith bring that person before the court to be dealt with according to law. The court also may 
insert in the warrant a command for the arrest of the person charged with the illegal detention 
and restraint.

32-22-30. Execution of warrant.
The officer to whom such warrant is delivered must execute it by bringing the person therein 
named before the court who directed the issuing of such warrant, but if such warrant is issued 
by   the   supreme   court   or   a   judge   thereof,   upon   the   return   of   the   warrant,   the   hearing   and 
decision of the matter may be ordered by such court or judge to be had before the district court 
of the proper county or the judge thereof.

32-22-31. Return to warrant - Procedure.
The person alleged to have such party under illegal confinement or restraint may make 
return to such warrant, as in case of a writ of habeas corpus, and the same may be denied, and 
like allegations, proofs, and trial thereupon may be had as upon a return to a writ of habeas 
corpus.

32-22-32. When person must be discharged.
If the party is held under illegal custody or restraint, the party must be discharged or be 

restored to the care or custody of the person entitled thereto.

32-22-33. When writ may be served.
Any writ or process authorized by this chapter may be issued and served on any day or at 

any time.

32-22-34. Accused liberated for want of prosecution.
If   any   person   shall   be   committed   for   a   criminal   or   supposed   criminal   matter   and   not 
admitted   to   bail,   and   shall   not   be   tried   on   or   before   the   second   term   of   the   court   having 
jurisdiction of the offense, the prisoner shall be set at liberty by the court, unless the delay shall 
happen on the application of the prisoner. If such court at the second term shall be satisfied that 
due exertions have been made to procure the evidence for and on behalf of the state, and that 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that such evidence may be procured at the third term, it 
shall have power to continue such case until the third term. If any such prisoner shall have been 
admitted to bail for a crime other than a capital offense, the court may continue the trial of said 
cause to a third term, if it shall appear by oath or affirmation that the witnesses for the state are 
absent, such witnesses being mentioned by name, and the court shown wherein their testimony 
is material.

32-22-35. Writ not allowed to delay trial.
To prevent any person from avoiding or delaying that person's trial, it shall not be lawful to 
remove   any   prisoner   on   habeas   corpus   under   this   chapter   out   of   the   county   in   which   the 
prisoner  is confined,  within  fifteen  days  next  preceding the term   of  the court  at  which such 
person ought to be tried, unless it is to convey the prisoner into the county where the offense 
with which the prisoner stands charged properly is cognizable.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
