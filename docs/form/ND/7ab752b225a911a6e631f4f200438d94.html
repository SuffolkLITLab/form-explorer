If you checkmarked Guardianship ONLY in the caption of your Part 2 and Part 4 forms,

2 and Part 4 forms, checkmark BOTH guardianship and conservatorship, and guardian 
and conservator throughout the Part 5 forms. 

Including Protected Information on the Form: 

The case records in guardianships and conservatorships of adults are generally available to the 
public, and anyone can request to look in almost any court file.  However, certain information is 
protected and required to remain confidential, even if the protected information is part of a 
public court case record. 

Protected Information is: 

•  Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. 
•  Birthdates. 
•  Minor child’s name.

Protected Information you reference in all of your Part 5 forms.

Take Notes: 

The purpose of the hearing is to decide what, if any, modifications need to be made to the 
other state’s guardianship and/or conservatorship order to conform to North Dakota law. 

If you, the ward/protected person, or other interested parties made requests to modify your 
authority, the purpose of the hearing will also be to decide whether to make modifications to 
you authority. 

Take good notes whenever the judge or judicial referee makes decisions about modifications. 

Often, judges and judicial referees assign the guardian or conservator to draft proposed 
findings of fact and orders based on the decisions made at the hearing. 

If you’re assigned to draft a proposed findings of fact and order, you’ll need good notes of all of 
the decisions made by the judge or judicial referee. 

Before the Hearing Ends:  

Make sure you understand what happens next. 

Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you need to do next. 

Step Six: The Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Modify the Other 
State’s Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Order. 

Based on the information presented at the hearing and/or review of the documents filed for 
Part 5, the judge or judicial referee will decide what, if any, modifications will be made to the 
other state’s guardianship and/or conservatorship order. 

The judge or judicial referee may make their decision at the hearing, or they may make their 
decision following the hearing.

Step Seven: Findings of Fact and Order and Letters of Guardianship and/or 
Conservatorship. 

The other state’s guardianship and/or conservatorship order isn’t modified until the North 
Dakota State District Court judge or judicial referee issues a signed and dated Findings of Fact 
and Order, and Letters of Guardianship and/or Conservatorship. 

THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY PREPARE THEIR OWN FINDINGS OF FACT 
AND ORDER AND LETTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP AND/OR CONSERVATORSHIP.

Letters of Guardianship and/or Conservatorship, you’ll be mailed a signed copy.

AND ORDER AND LETTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP AND/OR CONSERVATORSHIP FOR
