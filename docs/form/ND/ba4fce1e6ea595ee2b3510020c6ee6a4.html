Purpose 

These forms may be used by a person required to receive notice of North Dakota state district 
court adult guardianship or conservatorship proceedings to oppose the petition of the current 
Guardian or Conservator to transfer the entire case to the court of another state. 

North Dakota Century Code Section 28-35-15 gives the requirements and procedures related to 
requesting a North Dakota state district court transfer a guardianship and/or conservatorship of 
an adult to another state. 

If you are representing yourself, you complete and sign the forms.  If you are unsure how to 
proceed or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation, consult an attorney. 

Information About the Process the Guardian/Conservator Must Follow 

When a guardian or conservator wants to transfer a guardianship or conservatorship 
established by a North Dakota district court to another state’s court, the guardian or 
conservator must petition the North Dakota district court for permission to transfer 
jurisdictions.  (References to guardian or conservator also include co-guardians and co-
conservators.) 

If the North Dakota district court approves the transfer, the court will issue an order 
transferring the guardianship or conservatorship to the other state and terminating the North 
Dakota guardianship or conservatorship. 

For more information about the steps in the process of asking a North Dakota state district 
court to transfer a guardianship/conservatorship to another state, review the instructions for 
the guardian/conservator must follow at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/conservatorship/transfer. 

Requesting a Guardian Ad Litem for the Ward/Protected Person 

The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the ward or protected person upon the request 
of the ward or protected person, or any interested person.  A guardian ad litem is a lawyer 
appointed by a North Dakota District Court to advocate for the best interests of the ward or 
protected person. 

Guardian Ad Litem request forms are available with this packet of forms and available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer.

of proceedings related to the guardianship/conservatorship case. 

Step One: Calculate Your Deadline to Answer the Petition.  Decide Whether to

Calculate your Deadline to Answer the Petition to Transfer 

After you are served a copy of the Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship to 
Another State, you have either 14 or 17 calendar days to serve and file an answer brief to the 
petition.

When calculating days: 

•  Do not include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

Decide Whether to Request a Hearing on the Petition to Transfer 

A hearing is not required.  The Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship to Another 
State will be decided only on the documents filed with the District Court unless the 
guardian/conservator or a person required to receive notice of the Petition requests a hearing. 

If you decide to request a hearing on the Petition or Transfer, you may make the request as part 
of your answer to the petition. 

• 

If you do not make the request as part of your answer to the petition, you can make a 
separate request.  You have 7 days after the deadline expires for serving and filing your 
answer to make a separate request for a hearing. 

If you decide to request a hearing as part of your answer to the petition, you must contact the 
Clerk of North Dakota District Court where the guardianship/ conservatorship is filed to obtain 
a hearing date and time.

Step Three: Arrange Service of the Completed Answer to Petition Forms. 

Arrange to Have Completed Answer to Petition Forms Served 

The guardian/conservator, ward/protected person, and all interested persons designated in the 
order appointing the guardian/conservator must receive a copy of each of the following 
completed forms and any supporting documents you plan to file: 

•  Answer Brief to Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship to Another State;  
•  Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief to Petition to Transfer 
Guardianship/Conservatorship to Another State; and 

•  Rule 3.2 Notice of Hearing on Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship to

Copies may be mailed by first class, postage prepaid, or hand-delivered. 

You must provide proof to the District Court that copies of the completed documents were 
mailed or hand-delivered to the guardian/conservator, ward/protected person and all 
interested persons. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Legal Self Help & Forms” 

[Page 5 of 7] 

Oct 2019 

An affidavit of service gives the District Court proof that copies were provided. 

If you arrange to have the copies served by mail, the individual who takes the envelopes to the 
United States Post Office and pays the first-class postage completes the Affidavit of Service by 
Mail Form. 

If you arrange to have the copies served hand-delivered, the individual who hand-delivers the 
copies completes the Affidavit of Personal Service Form. 

Step Four: File the Original, Completed Forms with the Clerk of District Court. 

File the Original, Completed Forms with the Clerk of District Court Where the Petition was 
Filed 

File the original, completed answer to Petition forms, any supporting documentation, and the 
affidavit(s) of service with the clerk of court of the North Dakota State District Court that 
currently has jurisdiction of the guardianship. 

• Answer Brief to Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship to Another State;
• Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief to Petition to Transfer

Guardianship/Conservatorship to Another State;

• Rule 3.2 Notice of Hearing on Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship to

Another State (Optional);

• Any supporting documentation; and
• Affidavit(s) of Service.

Step Five: The Judge/Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant the Provisional 
Order to Transfer. 

If a Hearing is Scheduled, Attend the Hearing 

If a hearing is scheduled, attend the hearing. 

Be prepared to prove your Answer Brief to the Petition to Transfer Guardianship/ 
Conservatorship to Another State. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee assigned to the guardianship/conservatorship will decide whether 
to grant the provisional order to transfer after the hearing. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee may announce their decision at the end of the hearing, or may 
make their decision sometime after the end of the hearing. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Legal Self Help & Forms” 

[Page 6 of 7] 

Oct 2019 

You will receive a copy of the Judge or Judicial Referee’s decision, or order, usually by mail. 

If No Hearing is Scheduled, the Decision will be made Based on the Documents  

If no hearing is scheduled, the court will decide whether to grant the provisional order based 
only on the documents filed. 

You will receive a copy of the Judge or Judicial Referee’s decision, or order, usually by mail. 

Next Steps: If the Judge/Judicial Referee Decides to Grant the Provisional Order 
to Transfer, the Guardian/Conservator has More Steps. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee assigned to the guardianship/conservatorship grants the 
provisional order to transfer, the guardian/conservator must take additional steps: 

First: 

The guardian/conservator must petition a court of the other state to accept the 
transfer of the guardianship/conservatorship from North Dakota. 

Second: 

If the court of the other state accepts the transfer, the guardian/conservator must 
make a written motion to the North Dakota District Court for a final order 
confirming the transfer to the other state and terminating the North Dakota 
District Court guardianship/conservatorship. 

Third: 

If the North Dakota District Court grants the motion, the District Court issues a 
final order granting the transfer and terminating the North Dakota District Court 
guardianship/conservatorship. 

Fourth: 

The other state court takes over authority to hear and decide issues related to the 
guardianship/conservatorship. 

 

Do not include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
