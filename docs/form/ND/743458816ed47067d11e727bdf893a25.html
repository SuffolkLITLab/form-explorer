A Research Guide for a North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide ISN’T a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your research into adoption in North Dakota.  
This information isn’t intended for legal advice and can’t replace the advice of competent legal 
counsel licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references doesn’t mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

NO ADOPTION FORMS AVAILABLE 

Neither the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center nor the North Dakota Court System have forms 
or instructions available specifically for use in adoption cases. 

If you represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own adoption legal documents, or retain 
a lawyer to do so. 

The basic steps in the adoption court process start on Page 7.  The steps include the names and 
general descriptions of some of the legal documents you’ll need to create and prepare. 

OVERVIEW OF ADOPTION 

What is adoption? 

Adoption is a civil court process in North Dakota state district court that creates the relationship 
of parent and child between the individual petitioning to adopt and the adopted individual. 

The adopted individual is considered a legitimate blood descendant, for all purposes, including 
inheritance and applicability of statutes, documents, and instruments, whether executed 
before or after the adoption is decreed, which don’t expressly exclude an adopted individual 
from their operation or effect.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to adoption is to use the print version of the North 
Dakota Century Code to locate the short summaries of case law after each Section.  Case law 
summaries directly follow the text of the Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the 
opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court Opinions” link and enter the 
case name or case citation. 

You may also research case law by topic at www.ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Supreme Court 
Opinions” link, the “Topic” link, and then on the link for “Adoption.” 

NORTH DAKOTA COURT RULES: 
(Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to state court and how the dispute is 
conducted.  All of the court rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.) 

At minimum, review the following: 

North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp. 

North Dakota Rules of Court: www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct. 

North Dakota Rules of Evidence: www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev. 

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE THROUGH LEGISLATION, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AND 
RULINGS, AND COURT DECISIONS.

Adoption/Rev Dec 2019 

Adoption Summons Requirements: 

A summons directs the Respondent to answer the adoption petition within a certain amount of 
time.  The summons notifies the Respondent that a default judgment may be taken against 
them if the Respondent doesn’t answer. 

Certain information must be included in the summons.  The requirements are found in Rule 4 of 
the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure (www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp/4).   

An example of a civil summons is available in the Appendix of Forms to the North Dakota Rules 
of Civil Procedure. 

A general-use summons form is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/general-use-
forms. 

Adoption Petition Requirements: 

A petition is a written demand or request for a judgment granting the relief the Petitioner is 
seeking.   

A petition must describe in short, plain statements showing that the Petitioner meets the 
requirements for the adoption, is entitled to the adoption being granted, and end with a 
request for an adoption decree. 

Refer to North Dakota Century Code Sections 14-15-04 and 14-15-09 to determine the 
minimum requirements of what must be included in the petition for adoption.  Other sections 
of Chapter 14-15 may apply.  Review the Chapter carefully! 

The verification of the Petitioner directly follows the date and signature on the petition 
document. 

•  Verification of the adoption petition is a sworn statement of the correctness, truth or 

authenticity of the document by the Petitioner. 

Written Consent(s) Requirements: 

Refer to North Dakota Century Code Sections 14-15-05 and 14-15-06 to determine the people

Proof of Service Requirements: 

Serving (giving) copies of the adoption documents is an important step in the legal process. 

The service rules are in Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. 

Review North Dakota Century Code Chapter 14-15 to determine who must be served the 
documents to start an adoption case. 

Proof of service of the following documents is required for each Respondent: 

•  Summons 
•  Adoption Petition 

o  Verification of Petitioner 

•  Written Consent(s) of People Required to Give Consent 

An affidavit of service is the proof of service.  However, if a sheriff served the documents, a 
certificate of service is the proof of service. 

The document showing proof of service must be filed with the clerk of district court. 

The court won’t act on the adoption petition until proof of service is filed for all Respondents 
on all people who must be provided with notice of the hearing. 

Information about service to start a civil action and blank proof of service forms are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

Respondent’s Answer to Adoption Petition Requirements: 

When a Respondent is served a Summons and a copy of the Adoption Petition, the Respondent 
has 21 days to serve a written answer to the Adoption Petition. 

If the Respondent doesn’t serve a written answer to the Adoption Petition within the 21 day 
timeline, the North Dakota state district court may grant the adoption without the 
Respondent’s input. 

For general information about the answer requirements and process in a civil action, go to 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/answering-a-civil-action. 

If the Respondent is also required to receive notice of the adoption hearing, the Respondent 
may be allowed to present their side at the hearing.  Review North Dakota Century Code 
Chapter 14-15 to determine who must be served the notice of hearing on the adoption petition.  
See Sections 14-15-06 and 14-15-11, in particular. 

See below for more information about the notice of hearing process. 

NDLSHC Research Guide

Adoption/Rev Dec 2019 

NOTE:   In some adoption cases, the adoption case may start by serving a Notice of 

Hearing and a copy of the Adoption Petition on each Respondent, rather than serving a 
Summons and a copy of the Adoption Petition. 

This research guide doesn’t include information on the adoption process when service 
of a Notice of Hearing and a copy of the Adoption Petition starts the adoption case. 

If you’re a Respondent who was served a Notice of Hearing and a copy of the Adoption 
Petition to start the adoption case, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota 
who can agree to represent you. 

If you can’t afford the $80.00 filing fee, forms and instructions to ask the court to waive the 
filing fee are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver.  The completed fee 
waiver request forms are filed at the same time as the adoption documents. 

Request a Hearing on the Petition for Adoption: 

A court hearing on the petition for adoption is required. 

If the adoption documents are accepted by the clerk of district court for filing, the Petitioner 
requests a hearing on the petition for adoption.  Follow the requirements of the individual state 
district court for requesting a hearing. 

After the hearing date is scheduled, the clerk of court may serve notice of the hearing, or the 
Petitioner may be required to prepare and serve notice of the hearing.

Proof of service of the following documents is required for each person required to receive 
notice of the hearing: 

•  Notice of Hearing on the Adoption Petition

certificate of service is the proof of service. 

The document showing proof of service must be filed with the clerk of district court. 

The court won’t act on the adoption petition until proof of service is filed for all Respondents 
on all people who must be provided with notice of the hearing. 

Information about service to start a civil action and blank proof of service forms are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

Respondents Attend the Hearing to Present Objections: 

In general, when a Respondent is served a Notice of Hearing on the Adoption Petition and a 
copy of the Adoption Petition, the Respondent may be allowed to present their side at the 
hearing. 

Read the notice of hearing carefully and follow the requirements. 

Prepare Your Case: 

The Petitioner must prove the allegations in their adoption petition and the grounds (reasons) 
for the adoption. 

Each Respondent may present evidence to disprove the Petitioner’s allegations and proof. 

Caution! Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. You’re held to the same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or 
procedures. You’ll need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 11 of 14 

Adoption/Rev Dec 2019 

At minimum, review and research the laws and rules listed above.  You’ll use the North Dakota 
Rules of Evidence, in particular, to present your evidence and object to the Respondent’s 
evidence. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. 

Attend the Hearing 

There may be more than one hearing, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.  Be 
prepared for every hearing. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Don’t miss your hearing date and time. If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get 
to court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the courthouse as soon as you can.  

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge hears both sides and then issues a final judgment.  Sometimes, the final judgment is 
issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final judgment is issued at a later date.  

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Petitioner goes first. 

•  Petitioner Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Petitioner presents their case first. 
o  The Respondent may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Petitioner’s 

evidence. 

•  Respondent Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Respondent presents their case after the Petitioner. 
o  The Petitioner may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Respondent’s 

evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Respondent goes first. 

The judge of the district court will decide if the Petitioner proved the grounds for the adoption.  
If the judge decides the Petitioner proved the grounds for adoption, the adoption will be 
finalized.

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

GENERAL-USE TEMPLATE FORMS 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions available for 
adoption. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own legal documents, or retain 
an lawyer to do so. 

Although the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have forms or instructions for adoption, the 
following General-Use template forms are available at General Use Checklists and Forms. You 
may find the General-Use template forms useful as a starting point for creating your own 
adoption legal documents. 

•  Caption and Signature (Petition) Form 
•  Verification (Petition) Form 

The Guide to a Civil Action is available at Guide to a District Court Civil Action. 

Legal Services of North Dakota created a Family Law Manual for lawyers.  The Family Law 
Manual is available at www.legalassist.org/?id=128&page=ND+Family+Law+Manual.  There are 
examples of documents available under the "Adoption" section.  You may find the examples of 
interest for general formatting purposes.

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

You aren’t required to hire a lawyer to access the state court system.  If you decide to represent 
yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that a lawyer is required to 
follow. 

Lawyer Resources 

If you decide to find a lawyer to represent you, you may find the following options of interest. 

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income. Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income. The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is 
www.legalassist.org. 

•  The State Bar Association provides a lawyer referral service to match paying clients in 
need of legal services with lawyers. The phone number is (866) 450-9579 and the 
website is www.sband.org. 

•  For a list of all lawyers who are licensed to practice in North Dakota, go to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court website at www.ndcourts.gov/Lawyers.  You can narrow your 
search by name or location. 

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled.  For example: 

•  You may want a lawyer to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your legal 

•  You can consult with a lawyer to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend hearings 

rights and responsibilities; 

yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with a 

lawyer who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire a lawyer just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
