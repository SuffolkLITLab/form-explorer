no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the 
ND Legal Self Help Center.  Use at your own risk. 

North Dakota state district court and Small Claims Court case records are

records in almost any court case.

STEP FIVE: 

FILE THE FORMS WITH THE DISTRICT COURT 

Take the original of the “Petition for Waiver of Filing Fees" form (Form 1), the "Financial 
Affidavit  in  Support  of  Petition  for  Waiver  of  F i l i n g   Fees"  (Form  2),  and  the  "Order 
Waving Filing Fees" (Form 3) to the Clerk of Court’s Office in the county where your civil 
case or Small Claims Court case is located. 

Tell the Clerk of Court that you wish to file the documents.  You may file the forms at the 
same time you file your documents that generate the filing fee. 

WAIT TO SEE HOW THE COURT DECIDES YOUR PETITION 

STEP SIX: 

The court will notify you if you can proceed without paying the filing fees by sending a 
signed copy of an order to you.   

If the Court grants your petition and uses your proposed order, you’ll receive a copy of the 
completed and signed Order Waiving Filing Fees form.  If the Court grants your petition, but 
doesn’t use your proposed order, you’ll receive a copy of the Court’s order. 

If you requested waiver of filing fees and the Court grants your petition, you’ll be able to 
proceed without paying the filing fees. 

If the Court doesn’t grant your petition, you’ll receive a copy of the Court’s order denying 
your petition.  You’ll have to pay the filing fees before your documents can be filed in the 
case.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
