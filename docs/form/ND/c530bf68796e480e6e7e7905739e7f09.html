 AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO ANSWER A SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT 
      OR ANSWER A MOTION 

ND Legal Self Help Center Staff and Court employees cannot help you fill out forms.  If you are 
unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer. 

There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  Use at your own risk. 

Do not include these instruction sheets when you serve or file the completed forms. 

SEE THE “MOTIONS” SECTION OF THE GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION on the ND Legal Self Help 
Center website for additional information and resources about motions. 

After a civil action is filed with the court, a party in a civil action may ask the court for a hearing 
or trial to be continued for a different date and time, or ask for an extension of time to answer 
a summons and complaint or answer a motion.  The court decides whether to grant the motion. 

The party making the motion is the “Moving Party.”  The party responding to the motion is the 
“Opposing Party.” 

A copy of the completed notice of motion, motion, and (proposed) order must be served on all 
other parties in the civil action.  You must file proof of service with the court that you served 
copies of the notice of motion, motion, and (proposed) order on all other parties.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
