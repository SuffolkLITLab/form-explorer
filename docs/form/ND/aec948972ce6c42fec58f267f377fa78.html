Part 1: NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC 

[Page 1 of 14] 

Rev. Jul 2020 

You may use these forms if: 

1.  You are the guardian and/or conservator of an adult who was appointed by a 
North Dakota state district court.  You were appointed when the ward and/or 
protected person was 18 years old or older. 

AND 

2.  You want to transfer the entire guardianship and/or conservatorship case to the 
court of another state, so the court of the other state will have all authority over 
the guardianship and/or conservatorship.  This is called transferring jurisdiction. 

This is a 3 Part process.  ALL 3 Parts MUST be completed. 

Transferring jurisdiction of a guardianship and/or conservatorship case to a court of 
another state is a 3 Part process. 

You must complete all 3 Parts to transfer jurisdiction to the court of another state. 

Part 1. You Petition the North Dakota State District Court for a Provisional Order 

Transferring the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship to Another State 
Court. 

These are the instructions for the set of forms to complete Part 1. 

Part 2. You Work with the Other State Court to Get an Order Accepting the Transfer 

of the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship from North Dakota. 

You must work directly with the other state to fulfill the other state court’s 
process for obtaining an order accepting transfer of the entire guardianship 
and/or conservatorship case from the North Dakota state district court. 

The North Dakota state court system and the North Dakota Legal Self Help 
Center can’t assist you with Part 2 of the process. 

Part 3. After the Other State Court Issues the Order Accepting the Transfer, You 

Make a Motion for a Final Order Confirming Transfer to the Other State and 
Terminating the North Dakota Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Case. 

Instructions and a set of forms for completing Part 3 are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer.

Requesting a Guardian Ad Litem for the Ward and/or Protected Person 

The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the ward and/or protected person upon the 
request of the guardian, conservator, ward, protected person, or any interested person. 

A guardian ad litem is a lawyer appointed by a North Dakota District State Court to advocate for 
the best interests of the ward and/or protected person. 

Guardian Ad Litem request forms are available for use during this process.  You can find the 
request forms at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer. 

ND Laws and Rules

public court case record. 

Protected Information is:

Optional Step Two(a): Complete the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) Request and 
(Proposed)  Order For Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem Forms. 

A Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) is a lawyer appointed by the North Dakota state district court to 
advocate for the best interests of the ward or the protected person.  The GAL is paid by the 
ward’s or protected person’s estate. 

Appointing a GAL is optional when the Court is deciding whether to transfer jurisdiction of a 
guardianship and/or conservatorship to another state. 

If you decide to ask the Court to appoint a GAL for the ward or protected person, you’ll first 
need to find a GAL. 

No list of GAL’s specifically for guardianships or conservatorships of adults exists through the 
North Dakota Court System.  However, a GAL roster for use in child custody proceedings may 
be useful as a starting point.

•  Request for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem by Other Interested Person; and 
• 

(Proposed) Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. 

Serve one copy on each person required to receive notice: 

You may serve by hand delivery or by mail. 

Before the court will act on your petition, you must provide proof that copies of the completed 
documents were mailed or hand-delivered to all persons required to receive notice.  Form 5 
and Form 6 in this Part 1 packet of forms gives the Court proof that copies were served. 

Service by Hand Delivery: 

You may arrange for a person who is at least 18 years or older AND not a party or interested in 
the guardianship and/or conservatorship to hand the copies of documents to the person to be 
served. 

The person who handed copies of documents to the person to be served completes, signs and

Service by hand delivery is complete when the copies of documents are handed to the person 
to be served. 

Service by Mail: 

You may arrange for a person who is at least 18 years or older to mail copies of documents to 
the person to be served. 

Put the copies in an envelope.  Address the envelope with the last known address of the person 
to be served.  List your address as the return address on the envelope.  The person who is at 

Part 1: NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC 

[Page 11 of 14] 

Rev. Jul 2020 

least 18 years old takes the envelope to a United States Post Office and mails the envelope. 
First Class postage must be prepaid. 

The person who took the copies of documents to the Post Office and paid the First Class 
postage completes, signs and dates Form 6: Affidavit of Service by Mail. 

Service by mail is complete upon mailing. 

Step Four: File the Original, Completed Forms with the Clerk of District Court. 

File the following original, completed forms with the Clerk of the District Court that currently 
has authority over the guardianship and/or conservatorship: 

•  Form 1: Rule 3.2 Notice of Petition; 
•  Form 2: Petition to Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship from North Dakota to 

Another State; 

•  Form 3: Confidential Information Form; 
•  Form 4: (Proposed) Provisional Order Granting/Denying Petition to Transfer 

Guardianship/ Conservatorship to Another State; 

•  Copies of all supporting documents you plan to file with your petition; and 
•  An affidavit of service for every person required to receive notice of your petition. 

If you’re requesting appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL), file the following original, 
completed forms with the Clerk of the District Court: 

•  Request for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem by Other Interested Person; and 
• 

(Proposed) Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. 

Step Five: Each Person Required to Receive Notice has 14 to 17 Days to Answer

After each person required to receive notice is served your petition documents, they have 
either 14 days or 17 days to answer the petition in writing or request a hearing, or both.  They 
have 14 or 17 days depending on how you arranged for service. 

• 

If you arranged for service of your petition documents by hand delivery, they have 14 
days to answer your petition in writing, request a hearing, or both. 

o  The date of service is the date the petition documents were hand delivered to 

the person required to receive notice. 

Part 1: NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC 

[Page 12 of 14] 

Rev. Jul 2020 

• 

If you arranged for service of your petition documents by mail, they have 17 days to 
answer your petition in writing, request a hearing, or both. 

o  The date of service is the date the petition documents were mailed to the person 

required to receive notice. 

When calculating days: 

•  Do not include the day the person was served; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If the persons required to receive notice don’t serve and file a written answer to your petition 
or request a hearing, the judge may consider your petition unopposed. 

Step Six(a): If the Petition will be Decided on ONLY the Documents Filed with 
the Court, the Judge Reviews the Documents Without Holding an In-Person 
Hearing. 

After the deadline passes for answer to petition documents and request for hearing 
documents to be served and filed, if no one requested a hearing, the judge assigned to your 
case will review the documents filed by you and persons required to receive notice of your 
petition. 

Your petition will be decided only on the documents filed with the court. No in-person hearing 
will be held. 

If no person required to receive notice served and filed an answer to your petition, your 
petition documents are still required to prove you meet the requirements to transfer 
jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or conservatorship to another state. 

Step Six(b): If Anyone Requested an In-Person Hearing, Attend the Hearing. 

You must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  If you do not go to court, the judge won’t 
grant your petition.  Be sure to be on time. Bring to the hearing: 

•  Your copies of the completed forms you filed with the Clerk of Court’s Office; 
•  Any evidence you want the Judge to know about; and 

Part 1: NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC

Rev. Jul 2020 

•  Any witnesses you want to talk to the Judge. 

The Judge won’t allow you to use as evidence (and will not look at) any documents (such as 
letters, notes, or statements) written by someone other than yourself unless the person who 
wrote the document is in Court at the hearing. 

If you want the judge to hear what someone else has to say about your case, that person MUST 
be in court – YOU can’t tell the judge what that person said or has to say. You may force 
someone to attend the hearing by serving a subpoena on that person prior to the date of the 
hearing. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide and a Subpoena Informational Guide are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” Section. 

Step Seven: The Judge Decides Whether to Grant a Provisional Order to Transfer 
Jurisdiction to Another State. 

If the Judge DOESN’T Grant Your Petition to Transfer: 

If the Judge doesn’t grant your petition to transfer jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or 
conservatorship to another state, the North Dakota state district court keeps their authority 
over the guardianship and or conservatorship. 

If the Judge GRANTS Your Petition to Transfer: 

If the Judge grants your petition to transfer jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or 
conservatorship to another state, the Judge will sign a provisional order transferring jurisdiction 
to the other state. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign your proposed provisional order, or may 

decide to sign a different proposed provisional order. 

The provisional order isn’t a final order.  You must complete Part 2 and Part 3 of the transfer 
process before jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or conservatorship is transferred to the 
other state. 

 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
