Determine in Which North Dakota State District Court the Deceased 
Parent’s Will is Filed for Probate. 
The nominated guardian must file the document declining their 
nomination as guardian in the deceased parent’s probate case. 

Within 60 Days of the Death of the Parent, the Nominated Guardian Files 
a Document Declining the Nomination as Guardian. 
If the person nominated as guardian in the deceased parent’s will doesn’t 
want to accept the nomination, the person must file a decline the

The Juvenile Court will begin proceedings to determine who should be 
appointed guardian of the minor child.

District Court where the deceased parent’s probate case is filed:
