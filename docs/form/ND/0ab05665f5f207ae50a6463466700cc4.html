      <pre>MAKING A MOTION IN A GUARDIANSHIP CASE 
CHECKLIST 

This is a basic checklist for making a motion in a guardianship case in North Dakota State 
District Court.  There may be additional documents and procedures for your type of motion.  
If you’re unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center can provide basic process information.  The Center can’t act as 
your lawyer, or give you legal advice under any circumstances. 

THE “MOTIONS” SECTION OF THE GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION on the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website has additional information and resources. 

A motion is a written request to the court for an order in an existing case.  Motions may be 
made after the guardianship case is started.  A motion doesn’t start a guardianship case. 

•  Guardianship cases are started when a written petition to appoint a guardian for an 

adult is accepted for filing by the Clerk of District Court and a hearing date is scheduled. 

The party making the motion is called the “Moving Party.” 

The party answering the motion is called the “Opposing Party.” 

A written motion in a guardianship case is made up of the following set of documents: 

1.  Notice of Motion; 
2.  Motion; 
3.  Brief in Support of Motion; 
4.  Declaration in Support of Motion; and 
5.  Other Supporting Documents (you may not have supporting documents). 

Other documents may be required, depending on the court rule and/or law that apply to the 
type of motion you make. 

Has a Petition to appoint a guardian for an adult been accepted for filing by the Clerk of 
District Court AND a hearing date scheduled? 

  Yes.  The guardianship case number is ___________________________. 

  No.  DON’T CONTINUE.  Motions can’t be made until AFTER a petition to appoint a 

guardian for an adult is accepted for filing by the Clerk of District Court and a hearing 
date is scheduled.  See the resources for emergency guardianship and establishing 
guardianship on the “Guardianship of Adults” webpage to determine how to proceed.

Research North Dakota Laws and Court Rules: 

Information and resources for legal research are available through the North Dakota Legal Self 
Help Center.  Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Legal Research” section. 

A motion to the court must include the legal authority that supports the motion request.  The 
moving party must explain how and why the law, case law, and/or court rule supports the 
request. 

  Do any laws enacted by the North Dakota State Legislature support the motion request? 

The North Dakota Century Code contains laws enacted by the Legislature.  List any 
specific laws that support the request: _______________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 

  Does North Dakota Supreme Court case law support the motion request? 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the 
North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how 
and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way they did. The 
opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with 
similar facts and issues. List the specific case law that supports the request:  
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 
 

  Do any court rules support the motion request? 

North Dakota Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the 
dispute is conducted.  List the specific court rules that support the request: 
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 
 

(The North Dakota Century Code, and North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and North Dakota 
court rules are also found in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries.)

Create the Documents to Make a Motion in a Guardianship Case: 

(A General-Use Notice of Motion form is available on the “Guardianship of Adults” 
webpage.) 

  Notice of Motion 

  Motion 

(A General-Use Motion form is available on the “Guardianship of Adults” webpage.) 

  Brief in Support of Motion 

(A General-Use Brief in Support of Motion form is available on the “Guardianship of 
Adults” webpage.) 

  Declaration in Support of Motion 

(A General-Use Declaration form is available on the “Guardianship of Adults” webpage.) 

Gather Other Supporting Documents: 

A motion may include other supporting documents, such as declarations, affidavits or exhibits.   

•  Make a copy of each supporting document, if any, for each opposing party, plus one 

copy to keep as a record. 

Your motion, or your situation, may not require additional supporting documents. 

If you don’t know if your motion or situation requires additional supporting documents, consult 
a lawyer.  The ND Legal Self Help Center can’t advise you. 

Service of Motion Documents: 

The moving party must serve copies of their motion documents on the other parties in the 
guardianship case, including the Ward.  A completed and signed affidavit of service, declaration 
of service, or certificate of service is proof that service occurred. 

  Review service requirements for motions in Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  For more information about service requirements after a civil action has 
started, go to the Service link on the ND Legal Self Help Center website.  

  Obtain the address for service for each opposing party and the Ward.  If an opposing 
party or the Ward is represented by a lawyer, obtain the address for service for the 
lawyer.

Make a Motion Checklist/Rev. Apr 2022 

  Arrange for service of copies of the following documents on each opposing party and 
the Ward.  If an opposing party or the Ward is represented by a lawyer, arrange for 
service on the lawyer. 

  Notice of Motion; 
  Motion; 
  Brief in Support of Motion; 
  Declaration in Support of Motion; and 
  Other supporting documents, if any. 

  For each opposing party and the Ward, get the completed and signed affidavit of 

service, declaration of service, or certificate of service from the person who served the 
motion documents. 

File the Original Motion Documents with the North Dakota State District Court: 

The original of each of the motion documents and the document(s) showing proof of service 
must be filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

*** Filing doesn’t meet the requirements for service.*** 

  Contact the Clerk of District Court’s office in the County where you will file the motion 

documents for the following information: 

  Amount of the filing fee  $_________, if any, and how to pay. 
  Options for submitting motion documents to the Clerk of District Court if you 

can’t file the documents in person. 

  Gather the originals of the following documents (make copies for your records): 

  Notice of Motion; 
  Motion; 
  Brief in Support of Motion; 
  Declaration in Support of Motion; 
  Other supporting documents, if any; and 
  Affidavit(s) of Service, Declaration(s) of Service, and/or Certificate(s) of Service 
showing service of copies of the motion documents on each opposing party. 

  File the original documents with the clerk of court and pay the filing fee, if any.

Opposing Party’s Answer to Motion: 

If you arranged to serve the motion documents an opposing party or the Ward by handing the 
documents to the opposing party or the Ward, or by leaving the documents at the opposing 
party’s or Ward’s office or residence, the opposing party or the Ward has fourteen (14) days 
after service of the motion documents to answer the motion in writing. 

If you arranged to serve an opposing party or the Ward by mail or third party commercial 
carrier, the opposing party or the Ward has seventeen (17) days after service of the motion 
documents to answer the motion in writing. 

To calculate the deadline for each opposing party or the Ward to serve and file their answer to 
the motion: 

•  Don’t include the day the opposing party or the Ward was served. 
•  Starting the next calendar day after the opposing party or the Ward was served, count 

the number of calendar days. 

o 

o 

If you arranged for service by handing the documents or leaving the documents, 
count 14 calendar days. 
If you arranged for service by mail or third party commercial, count 17 calendar 
days. 

• 

If the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deadline continues to run 
until the next calendar day that isn’t a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 

The Court Decides the Motion: 

If either the moving party or an opposing party appropriately requested a hearing on the 
motion within the deadlines to request a hearing, the court decides the motion following the 
hearing. 

If neither the moving party nor an opposing party appropriately requested a hearing on the 
motion within the deadlines to request a hearing, the court decides the motion based only on 
the documents filed with the court. 

You’ll be notified in writing of the court’s decision on the motion.
