      <pre>MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

A Research Guide for a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota courts. 

The information provided in this research guide IS NOT a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your research into modifying primary residential 
responsibility in an order of a North Dakota district court.  The information provided in this 
research guide is not intended for legal advice and cannot replace the advice of competent 
legal counsel licensed in the state. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

(Primary residential responsibility means a parent with more than 50% of the residential 
responsibility.  Please note that in 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term 
“custody” to “residential responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

OVERVIEW OF MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY: 

When a North Dakota district court awarded residential responsibility in a family law case, such 
as divorce, legal separation, or other action to establish parenting rights and responsibilities, 
either parent may ask the court to modify primary residential responsibility in the existing case, 
if certain requirements are met.  

Time limitations when a final order establishing primary residential responsibility has not 
been modified: 

The parent requesting modification has the burden of proving requirements are met for 
modifying primary residential responsibility. 

In general, neither parent may request changes to primary residential responsibility until two 
(2) years after the date of entry of the final order establishing primary residential responsibility. 

Exceptions to the two (2) year time limit are: 

1.  The parents agree in writing to modifications to primary residential responsibility; 
2.  A shorter timeframe for modification to primary residential responsibility is included in 

the parenting plan; or

3.  The court finds one (or more) of the following: 

•  The persistent and willful denial or interference with parenting time; 
•  The child's present environment may endanger the child's physical or emotional 

health or impair the child's emotional development; or 

•  The primary residential responsibility for the child has changed to the other 

parent for longer than six months. 

The parent requesting modification to primary residential responsibility after the two (2) year 
time limitations must prove: 

1.  On the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior order, which were unknown at the 
time of the prior order, a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the 
child(ren) or the parties; and 

2.  The modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child(ren). 

Time limitations when a final order establishing primary residential responsibility has been 
modified: 

The parent requesting modification has the burden of proving the requirements are met for 
modifying primary residential responsibility. 

In general, neither parent may request additional modifications to primary residential 
responsibility until two (2) years after the date the final order modifying primary residential 
responsibility was entered. 

Exceptions to the two (2) year time limit are: 

1.  The parents agree in writing to modifications to primary residential responsibility; 
2.  A shorter timeframe for modification to primary residential responsibility is included in 

3.  The court finds modification is in the best interests of the child(ren) and one (or more) 

the parenting plan; or 

of the following: 

•  The persistent and willful denial or interference with parenting time; 
•  The child's present environment may endanger the child's physical or emotional 

health or impair the child's emotional development; or 

•  The primary residential responsibility for the child has changed to the other 

parent for longer than six months. 

The court may modify a prior order concerning primary residential responsibility at any time if 
the court finds a stipulated (settlement) agreement by the parties to modify the order is in the 
best interests of the child.

***Motions to Modify Primary Residential Responsibility Are a Two-Step Process*** 

STEP ONE: The parent requesting modification to primary residential responsibility must 
establish a written prima facie case for modification in their motion documents: 

The parent asking for modification must establish, in writing, a prima facie case for modification 
of primary residential responsibility. 

“Prima facie case” is not defined in the laws enacted by the North Dakota Legislature related to 
modifying primary residential responsibility.  You will need to research court opinions to define 
prima facie case and interpret for your situation.  (See below for researching case law.) 

STEP TWO: If the parent requesting modification establishes a written prima facie case for 
modification in their motion documents, the court will schedule an evidentiary hearing where 
the parent requesting modification must prove the allegations in their motion. 

The court will review the motion documents served and filed by the parent asking for 
modification and the response to the motion documents served and filed by the other parent.   

If the court determines that the parent requesting modification established a prima facie case 
for modification within the documents, the court will schedule an evidentiary hearing. 

If the parent requesting modification does not establish a prima facie case, the court will 
dismiss the motion. 

Within 30 days of entry of the court’s order for an evidentiary hearing, the parents and their 
attorneys, if any, must meet in person or by electronic means to prepare a joint informational 
statement.  The joint informational statement must be filed with the court within seven (7) 
days after the meeting. 

The parent asking for modification to primary residential responsibility has the burden of 
proving they meet all of the legal requirements for modification.

NORTH DAKOTA STATUTES RELATED TO MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW RELATED TO MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

Review the North Dakota Supreme Court opinions related to NDCC Section 14-09-06.6.  The 
opinions include interpretations of “prima facie case,” “material change in circumstances,” and 
circumstances that met the requirements for modification less than two years from the final 
order. 

One way to research case law related to NDCC Section 14-09-06.6, is to use the print version of 
the North Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each Section of 
the Century Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the 
Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself;

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
