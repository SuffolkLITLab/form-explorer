      <pre>REGISTERING A FOREIGN JUDGMENT 

A Research Guide for a North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota courts. 

The information provided in this research guide IS NOT a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your research into registering a foreign judgment 
in a North Dakota state district court.  The information provided in this research guide is not 
intended for legal advice and cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in 
the state. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

OVERVIEW OF REGISTERING A FOREIGN JUDGMENT: 

An authenticated copy of a judgment, decree or order of any other United States state court 
may be filed in a North Dakota state district court.   

A foreign judgment accepted for registration in a North Dakota state district court is treated in 
the same manner as a judgment issued by a North Dakota state district court.  For example, the 
registered foreign judgment may be enforced, collected or satisfied using the same processes 
available for judgments issued by North Dakota state district courts. 

Caution!  Additional or different requirements may apply, depending on the type of foreign 
judgment.  This research guide contains information for foreign judgments registered under 
North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-20.1 only.     

NORTH DAKOTA STATUTES RELATED TO REGISTERING A FOREIGN JUDGMENT: 
(North Dakota statutes are found in the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC).  The North Dakota 
Century Code contains the laws enacted by North Dakota Legislature.  The NDCC is found online 
at www.legis.nd.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code.  **These are not the full 
chapters and sections contained in the NDCC, please follow the links to view the laws in full.**)

Chapter 28-20.1.   
1.html 

Enforcement of Foreign Judgments. www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c20-

In Chapter 28-20.1, "foreign judgment" means any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the 
United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in North Dakota. 

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to registering a foreign judgment, is to use the print 
version of the North Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each 
Section of the Century Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of 
the Century Code Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click 
on the “Opinions” link under “Supreme Court” and enter the case name or case citation. 

Another way to research case law related to registering a foreign judgment, is to search by 
topic at www.ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Opinions” link under “Supreme Court”, then click on 
the link for the Topic in the “Topic” drop down menu.  

NORTH DAKOTA COURT RULES: 

Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is conducted.  All 
of the court rules are found online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules. 

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE THROUGH LEGISLATION, ADMINISTRATIVE 
RULINGS AND COURT DECISIONS.   

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota 
law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the 
North Dakota Century Code and North Dakota court rules are found in many North Dakota 
public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

LIBRARY RESOURCES: (Not all legal resources are available online.) 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (www.odin.nodak.edu) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

PROCESS FOR REGISTERING A FOREIGN JUDGMENT: 

Documents Required for Registering a Foreign Judgment: 

When registering a judgment under Chapter 28-20.1, the following documents are required: 

•  A petition or application for registration of a foreign judgment; 
•  An Affidavit of Identification of the judgment debtor; and 
•  An authenticated copy of the foreign judgment. 

File the Documents with the Clerk of District Court: 

The documents are filed with the clerk of court of the county where you register your foreign 
judgment.  If the clerk of court accepts your documents for filing, the clerk will assign a case 
number. 

You will be required to pay a $10.00 filing fee.  Confirm the amount with the clerk of court.  
Contact information for clerks of court by county is available online at www.ndcourts.gov  
under “District Courts”. 

Forms and instructions for requesting the court waive the filing fee are available online at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver.

Reg Foreign Jdgmt /Rev Mar 2019 

Notice of Filing 

When the petition, Affidavit of Identification and copy of the foreign judgment are filed, the 
clerk of court mails notice that the foreign judgment was filed to the judgment debtor.  The 
clerk of court mails the notice of filing to the address of the judgment debtor listed in the 
Affidavit of Identification. 

The clerk of court may require you to mail the notice of filing to the judgment debtor.  If you 
mail the notice of filing of the foreign judgment to the judgment debtor, you must file the 
original, completed notice of filing and an affidavit of service by mail with the clerk of court. 

After the Foreign Judgment is Registered: 

After a foreign judgment is registered in North Dakota District Court, you have the same 
judgment collection options as a judgment granted by a North Dakota court.  Email the ND 
Legal Self Help Center at ndselfhelp@ndcourts.gov for basic information about various 
processes to collect a judgment. 

FORMS FOR REGISTERING A FOREIGN JUDGMENT: 

An Affidavit of Identification form is available online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by 
clicking on the "Affidavit of Identification Form” under “Miscellaneous”. 

A Notice of Filing form is available online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking on 
the “General Use Checklists and Forms” link under “District Court Civil”. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center does not have a form for a petition or application for 
registration of a foreign judgment.  If you decide to represent yourself, you will need to create 
your own legal document. 

Although the ND Legal Self Help Center does not have a form for a petition or application for 
registration of a foreign judgment, a variety of General-Use forms are available as a starting 
point for creating your own legal documents. 

The Guide to a District Court Civil Action is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by 
clicking on the "Guide to a District Court Civil Action" link under “District Court Civil”.

ATTORNEY RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION: 

You are not required to hire an attorney to access the state court system.  If you decide to 
represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that an attorney is 
required to follow. 

Attorney Resources 

If you decide to find an attorney to represent you, you may find the following options of 
interest. 

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income. Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income. The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is 
www.legalassist.org. 

•  The State Bar Association provides a lawyer referral service to match paying clients in 
need of legal services with lawyers. The phone number is (866) 450-9579 and the 
website is www.sband.org. 

•  For a list of all lawyers who are licensed to practice in North Dakota, go to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court website at www.ndcourts.gov/Lawyers.  You can narrow your 
search by name or location. 

Limited Legal Representation 

Attorneys licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an 
attorney can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the 
part of the case the attorney handled.  For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
