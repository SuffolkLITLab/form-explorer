Guardianship or Conservatorship of an Adult to Another State 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms. 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms.

lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and

[Page 1 of 15] 

Rev. Jul 2020 

You may use these forms if: 

1.  You are the guardian and/or conservator of an adult who was appointed by a 
North Dakota state district court.  You were appointed when the ward and/or 
protected person was 18 years old or older. 

AND 

2.  You want to transfer the entire guardianship and/or conservatorship case to the 
court of another state, so the court of the other state will have all authority over 
the guardianship and/or conservatorship.  This is called transferring jurisdiction. 

This is a 3 Part process.  ALL 3 Parts MUST be completed. 

Transferring jurisdiction of a guardianship and/or conservatorship case to a court of 
another state is a 3 Part process. 

You must complete all 3 Parts to transfer jurisdiction to the court of another state. 

Part 1. You Petition the North Dakota State District Court for a Provisional Order 

Transferring the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship to Another State 
Court. 

Instructions and a set of forms for completing Part 1 are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer 

Part 2. You Work with the Other State Court to Get an Order Accepting the Transfer 

of the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship from North Dakota. 

You must work directly with the other state to fulfill the other state court’s 
process for obtaining an order accepting transfer of the entire guardianship 
and/or conservatorship case from the North Dakota state district court. 

The North Dakota state court system and the North Dakota Legal Self Help 
Center can’t assist you with Part 2 of the process. 

Part 3. After the Other State Court Issues the Order Accepting the Transfer, You 

Make a Motion for a Final Order Confirming Transfer to the Other State and 
Terminating the North Dakota Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Case. 

These are the instructions for the set of forms to complete Part 3.

Requesting a Guardian Ad Litem for the Ward and/or Protected Person 

The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the ward and/or protected person upon the 
request of the guardian, conservator, ward, protected person, or any interested person. 

A guardian ad litem is a lawyer appointed by a North Dakota District Court to advocate for the 
best interests of the ward and/or protected person. 

Guardian Ad Litem request forms are available for use during this process.  You can find the 
request forms at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer. 

ND Laws and Rules

Proceedings Jurisdiction Act contain requirements for transferring guardianships of adults.  
Chapter 28-35 is available at www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c35.html.

to another state, see Section 28-35-15: Transfer of Guardianship or Conservatorship to 
Another State.  (www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c35.pdf#nameddest=28-35-15)

Procedure, the North Dakota Rules of Court, or the North Dakota Rules of Evidence.  The rules 
are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.

and/or Request a Hearing. 

After each person required to receive notice is served your motion documents, they have either 
14 days or 17 days to answer the motion in writing or request a hearing, or both.  They have 14 
or 17 days depending on how you arranged for service.

[Page 13 of 15] 

Rev. Jul 2020 

• 

• 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by hand delivery, they have 14 
days to answer your motion in writing, request a hearing, or both. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion documents were hand delivered to the 

person required to receive notice. 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by mail, they have 17 days to 
answer your petition in writing, request a hearing, or both. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion documents were mailed to the person 

required to receive notice. 

When calculating days: 

•  Do not include the day the person was served; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If the persons required to receive notice don’t serve and file a written answer to your motion or 
request a hearing, the judge may consider your motion unopposed. 

Step Six(a): If the Motion will be Decided on ONLY the Documents Filed with the 
Court, the Judge Reviews the Documents Without Holding an In-Person Hearing. 

After the deadline passes for answer to motion documents and request for hearing 
documents to be served and filed, if no one requested a hearing, the judge assigned to your 
case will review the documents filed by you and persons required to receive notice of your 
motion. 

Your motion will be decided only on the documents filed with the court. No in-person hearing 
will be held. 

If no person required to receive notice served and filed an answer to your motion, your motion 
documents are still required to prove you meet the requirements for the court to issue a final 
order confirming transfer of the guardianship and/or conservatorship to another state and 
terminating the North Dakota guardianship and/or conservatorship.

Step Six(b): If Anyone Requested an In-Person Hearing, Attend the Hearing. 

You must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  If you do not go to court, the judge won’t 
grant your motion.  Be sure to be on time. Bring to the hearing: 

•  Your copies of the completed forms you filed with the Clerk of Court’s Office; 
•  Any evidence you want the Judge to know about; and 
•  Any witnesses you want to talk to the Judge. 

The Judge won’t allow you to use as evidence (and will not look at) any documents (such as 
letters, notes, or statements) written by someone other than yourself unless the person who 
wrote the document is in court at the hearing. 

If you want the judge to hear what someone else has to say about your case, that person MUST 
be in court – YOU cannot tell the judge what that person said or has to say. You may force 
someone to attend the hearing by serving a subpoena on that person prior to the date of the 
hearing. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide and a Subpoena Informational Guide are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” Section. 

Step Seven: The Judge Decides Whether to Grant a Final Order to Transfer 
Jurisdiction to Another State and Terminate the North Dakota case. 

If the Judge DOESN’T Grant Your Motion for a Final Order to Transfer Jurisdiction: 

If the Judge doesn’t grant your motion for a final order transferring jurisdiction to another state 
and terminating the North Dakota guardianship and/or conservatorship, the North Dakota state 
district court keeps their authority over the guardianship and or conservatorship. 

If the Judge GRANTS Your Motion for a Final Order to Transfer Jurisdiction: 

If the Judge grants your motion for a final order transferring jurisdiction to another state and 
terminating the North Dakota guardianship and/or conservatorship, the Judge will sign a final 
order transferring jurisdiction to the other state and terminating the North Dakota case. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign your proposed provisional order, or may 

decide to sign a different proposed provisional order. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
