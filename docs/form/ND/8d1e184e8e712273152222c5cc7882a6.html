Subpoena Non-ND Case/Oct 2021 

OVERVIEW OF SUBPOENAS FOR OUT-OF-STATE COURT CASES 

What is a subpoena for an out-of-state court case, also called domesticating a foreign 
subpoena? 

A party in an out-of-state court case may need to subpoena witnesses located in North Dakota, 
records, documents and other tangible items located in North Dakota, or to inspect premises 
located in North Dakota. 

The party in the out-of-state court case may be required to request that a North Dakota state 
district court issue a subpoena.  The subpoena issued by the North Dakota State District Court 
mirrors the subpoena issued by the out-of-state court. 

This process is also called domesticating a foreign subpoena. 

Rule 5.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court governs requests to North Dakota state district 
courts for subpoenas for out-of-state court cases. 

Are there definitions that are helpful for understanding the process? 

Yes.  Following are the definitions from Rule 5.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court that apply 
to requesting subpoenas for out-of-state court cases: 

•  Foreign Jurisdiction: A state other than North Dakota. 

•  Foreign Subpoena: A subpoena issued under the authority of a court of a foreign 

jurisdiction. 

•  Person: 

o  An individual; 
o  A corporation; 
o  A business trust; 
o  An estate; 
o  A trust; 
o  A partnership; 
o  A limited liability company; 
o  An association; 
o  A joint venture; A public corporation; 
o  A government or governmental subdivision; 
o  An agency or instrumentality; or 
o  Any other legal or commercial entity. 

 

NDLSHC Research Guide

Subpoena Non-ND Case/Oct 2021 

•  State: A state of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United 
States Virgin Islands, a federally recognized Indian tribe, or any territory or insular 
possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. 

•  Subpoena: A document, however named, issued under the authority of a state court 

requiring a person to: 

o  Attend and give testimony at a deposition; 
o  Produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents, 
records, electronically stored information, or tangible things in the possession, 
custody, or control of the person; or 

o  Permit inspection of premises under the control of the person. 

Who issues a subpoena for an out-of-state court case? 

Only a North Dakota Clerk of District Court can issue a subpoena for an out-of-state court case 
under Rule 5.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court.  Parties in an out-of-state court case and 
lawyers representing the parties aren’t allowed to issue a subpoena. 

The request is made to the Clerk of District Court of the North Dakota county where the subject 
of the subpoena is located or will occur. 

•  To attend and give testimony at a deposition, make the request in the North Dakota 

county where the deposition will take place. 

•  To produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, documents, etc., 

make the request in the North Dakota county where the designated books, documents, 
etc. are located. 

•  To permit inspection of premises, make the request in the North Dakota county where 

the premises are located. 

Contact information for Clerks of District Court by North Dakota county is available at 
ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

Does a request to issue a subpoena mean the party in the out-of-state court case is making an 
“appearance” in a North Dakota state district court? 

No.  An appearance is an action that lets a North Dakota state court know a party, or a party’s 
lawyer, will participate in a case. 

A request for a North Dakota state district court to issue a subpoena in an out-of-state court 
case, on its own, isn’t an appearance by the party, or the party’s lawyer.

Subpoena Non-ND Case/Oct 2021 

What is the minimum the Clerk of District Court needs to issue a subpoena? 

At minimum, the party requesting the subpoena must submit the following to the Clerk of 
District Court: 

•  The foreign subpoena issued under the authority of the foreign jurisdiction; and 
•  A $10.00 fee. 

What else does the Clerk of District Court need to issue a subpoena? 

Depending on the procedure of each individual county, the Clerk of District Court may require 
the party requesting the subpoena to submit a completed, unsigned subpoena for the Clerk of 
District Court to sign. 

The completed, unsigned subpoena must incorporate the terms used in the foreign subpoena. 

The completed, unsigned subpoena must also contain, or be accompanied by, the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of all lawyers of record in the out-of-state court case and all 
self-represented parties in the out-of-state court case. 

The Clerk of District Court issues the subpoena with their signature and the party who 
requested the subpoena may arrange for service. 

What if the Clerk of District Court issues a blank subpoena? 

If the Clerk of District Court issues a blank subpoena, the party requesting the subpoena 
completes the subpoena before arranging for service. 

The subpoena must incorporate the terms used in the foreign subpoena. 

The completed, unsigned subpoena must also contain, or be accompanied by, the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of all lawyers of record in the out-of-state court case and all 
self-represented parties in the out-of-state court case. 

After the subpoena is completed, the party who requested the subpoena may arrange for 
service. 

What are the service requirements for subpoenas issued under Rule 5.1? 

Service requires delivery of the subpoena to the person to whom the subpoena is directed. A 
proof of service document shows when, how and where the person was served. 

The service requirements for subpoenas issued under Rule 5.1 of the North Dakota Rules of 
Court depend on the type of case taking place in the out-of-state court: 

NDLSHC Research Guide 

Page 4 of 9 

Subpoena Non-ND Case/Oct 2021 

•  Civil Cases: the subpoena must be served as required by Rule 45(b) of the North Dakota 

Rules of Civil Procedure. 

o  Subpoenas must be served by one of the options in Rule 4(d) of the North 

Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.  Review Rule 4(d) carefully! 

o  See also the information in the “Service to Start a District Court Civil Action” 
section of https://www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 

•  Criminal Cases: the subpoena must be served as required by Rule 17(d) of the North 

Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure. 

• 

Juvenile Cases: the subpoena must be served as required by Rule 13(b) of the North 
Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure. 

What if a person doesn’t obey the subpoena? 

If the person to whom the subpoena is directed doesn’t obey the subpoena, the party, or the 
party’s lawyer, in the out-of-state court case may apply to the North Dakota State District Court 
to enforce the subpoena issued under Rule 5.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court. 

The application must comply with North Dakota subpoena and discovery court rules, statutes, 
and case law. 

CAUTION:  An application to enforce the subpoena may be considered an “appearance” in the 

North Dakota State District Court that issued the subpoena. 

Does a person responding to a subpoena have any protections? 

Yes, under Rule 5.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court, a person to whom the subpoena is 
directed may apply to the North Dakota State District Court for a protective order, or to quash 
or modify the subpoena. 

The application must comply with North Dakota subpoena and discovery court rules, statutes, 
and case law. 

CAUTION:  If the person applying for a protective order, or to quash or modify the subpoena is 

an entity created by law, the person can’t be represented by a non-lawyer in North Dakota 
State District Court. 

See the definition of “Person” on Page 2 of this Research Guide.  Except for “an individual,” all 
other persons listed are entities created by law. 

Entities created by law MUST be represented by a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota.

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES 

NORTH DAKOTA STATE STATUTES: 

North Dakota state statutes are found in the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC).  The North 
Dakota Century Code contains the laws enacted by the North Dakota Legislature. 

The NDCC is available at legis.nd.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code. 

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 

(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to subpoenas and discovery is to use the print version of 
the North Dakota Century Code to locate the short summaries of case law after each Section.  
Case law summaries directly follow the text of the Century Code Section.  To view the full text 
of the opinion, go to ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court Opinions” link and enter the 
case name or case citation. 

You may also research case law by topic at ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Supreme Court 
Opinions” link, the “Topic” link, and narrow your search by clicking on a topic. 

NORTH DAKOTA COURT RULES: 

(Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to state court and how the dispute is 
conducted.  All of the court rules are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.) 

At minimum, review the following: 

North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp. 

•  Rule 26 through Rule 37 govern discovery in civil actions. 
•  Rule 45 governs subpoenas in civil actions. 

North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure: ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcrimp. 

•  Rule 15 through Rule 16 govern depositions and discovery in criminal actions. 
•  Rule 17 governs subpoenas in criminal actions.

Subpoena Non-ND Case/Oct 2021 

North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure: ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrjuvp. 

•  Rule 12 through Rule 12.1 govern depositions and discovery in juvenile court actions. 
•  Rule 13 governs subpoenas in juvenile court actions. 

North Dakota Rules of Court: ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct. 

•  Rule 5.1 governs interstate depositions and discovery, including subpoenas, in civil, 

criminal, and juvenile court actions. 

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE THROUGH LEGISLATION, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AND 
RULINGS, AND COURT DECISIONS.   

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rules and rulings, and case law.  If you need assistance determining whether 
specific laws, rules or case law apply to your situation, or determining how they apply to your 
situation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent 
you. 

Only a lawyer who has agreed to represent you can give you legal advice.  Legal advice includes 
interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your circumstances. 

LIBRARY RESOURCES: (Not all legal resources are available online.) 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled. 

For example: 

rights and responsibilities; 

yourself; 

•  You may want a lawyer to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your legal 

•  You can consult with a lawyer to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend hearings 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with a 

lawyer who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire a lawyer just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
