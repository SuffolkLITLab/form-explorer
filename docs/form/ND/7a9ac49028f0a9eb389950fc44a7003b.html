      <pre>ANSWERING A MOTION IN A CONSERVATORSHIP CASE 
CHECKLIST 

This is a basic checklist for answering a motion in a conservatorship case in North Dakota 
State District Court.  There may be additional documents and procedures for your type of 
motion.  If you’re unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center can provide basic process information.  The Center can’t give 
you legal advice or act as your lawyer under any circumstances. 

THE “ANSWERING A MOTION” PAGE on the ND Legal Self Help Center website has additional 
information and resources. 

A motion is a written request to the court for an order in an existing case.  Motions may be 
made after the conservatorship case is started.  A motion doesn’t start a conservatorship case. 

•  Conservatorship cases are started when a written petition to appoint a conservator for 

an adult or a minor child is accepted for filing by the Clerk of District Court and a hearing 
date is scheduled. 

An answer to motion is a written response to the motion. 

The party making the motion is called the “Moving Party.” The party answering the motion is 
called the “Opposing Party.” 

The moving party notifies the opposing party of the motion by serving copies of the motion 
documents on the opposing party.   

If the moving party arranges to serve the motion documents on an opposing party or the 
Protected Party by handing the documents to the opposing party or the Protected Party, or by 
leaving the documents at the opposing party’s or Protected Party’s office or residence, the 
opposing party or the Protected Party has fourteen (14) days after service of the motion 
documents to answer the motion in writing. 

If the moving party arranges to serve an opposing party or the Protected Party by mail or third 
party commercial carrier, the opposing party or the Protected Party has seventeen (17) days 
after service of the motion documents to answer the motion in writing.

Answer a Motion Checklist/Dec 2021 

An answer to a motion in a conservatorship case is made up of the following set of documents: 

1.  Answer Brief to Motion; 
2.  Declaration in Support of Answer Brief; 
3.  Other Supporting Documents; and 
4.  Notice of Hearing on Motion (if the opposing party requests a hearing). 

Carefully Review the Motion Documents: 

Carefully review the notice of motion, motion, brief in support of motion, declaration in 
support of motion and any other supporting documents you were served by the moving party. 

The notice of motion will provide information about who to serve and the deadline to serve 
your written answer to the motion. 

The other documents will list the legal authority that the moving party believes supports their 
motion request, and explain how and why the moving party believes the law, case law or court 
rules support their request. 

Calculate the Deadline to Answer the Motion: 

If you were served the motion documents by handing the documents to you, or by leaving the 
documents at your office or residence, you have fourteen (14) days after the date you were 
served to answer the motion in writing. 

If you were served by mail or third party commercial carrier, you have seventeen (17) days after 
the date you were served to answer the motion in writing. 

Review the laws and rules from the motion documents to determine if the timeframe to answer 
the motion is different than the deadlines in the two paragraphs above. 

To calculate your deadline to serve and file your written answer to the motion: 

•  Don’t include the day you were served. 
•  Starting the next calendar day after you were served, count the number of calendar 

days. 
o 

o 

If you were served by handing the documents or leaving the documents, count 
14 calendar days. 
If you were served by mail or third party commercial, count 17 calendar days. 

• 

If the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deadline continues to run 
until the next calendar day that isn’t a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

Answer a Motion Checklist/Dec 2021 

  Date the motion documents were served on you, the opposing party: _______________ 
(Review Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for service of motions.) 

  Using calendar days, calculate the date your written answer to motion must be served 
on the moving party and any other opposing parties: ____________________________ 

Make a Copy of the Brief in Support of Motion to Mark Up: 

Make at least one copy of the moving party’s brief in support of motion.  Using the checklists on 
pages 3 and 4 go through your working copy of the brief in support of motion with a pencil and 
make notes. 

Make note of any points you want to make in your answer to the motion. Use your marked-up 
copy of the brief in support of motion, and pages 3 and 4 to help you organize and prepare your 
written answer to the motion. 

Research North Dakota Laws and Court Rules: 

Information and resources for legal research are available through the North Dakota Legal Self 
Help Center.  Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Legal Research” section. 

Review the motion and brief in support of the motion carefully! 

A motion must include the legal authority that supports the motion request.  Any motions to 
the court must refer to the laws, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and court rules, or a 
combination of all three, upon which the motion is filed.  The Brief in support of the motion 
explains how and why the law, case law, or court rule supports the moving party’s request. 

Research the laws, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and court rules the moving party 
used to make their arguments.  Try to determine if the laws and rules stand for what the 
moving party says they do. 

Conduct your own research to determine if there are other laws, North Dakota Supreme Court 
case law, and court rules that support your argument. 

The North Dakota Century Code contains laws enacted by the Legislature. 

  Does the brief in support of motion include any laws enacted by the North Dakota State 

Legislature?  List the specific laws from the brief in support of the motion: 
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________

  Do any laws enacted by the Legislature support your argument for your answer to the 

motion? List the specific laws that support your answer: 
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________ 

North Dakota Supreme Court case law: When the decision of a case is appealed from a North 
Dakota state district court to the North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their 
opinion to explain how and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way 
they did.  The opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later 
cases with similar facts and issues. 

  Does the brief in support of motion include any North Dakota Supreme Court case law?  

List the specific case law from the brief in support of the motion: 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________ 

  Does any case law support your argument for your answer to the motion?  List any case 

law that supports your answer: 
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________ 

North Dakota Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is 
conducted.   

  Does the brief in support of motion include any court rules?  List the specific court rules 

from the brief in support of the motion: 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________ 

  Do any court rules support your argument for your answer to the motion?  List the 

specific court rules that supports your answer:

(The North Dakota Century Code, and North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and North Dakota 
court rules are also found in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries.) 

Create the Documents to Answer a Motion in a Conservatorship Case: 

  Answer Brief to Motion 

(A General-Use Answer Brief to Motion form is available on the “Conservatorship of 
Adults & Minor Children” webpage.) 

  Declaration in Support of Answer Brief 

(A General-Use Declaration form is available on the “Conservatorship of Adults & Minor 
Children” webpage.) 

  Notice of Hearing on Motion (Required only if the opposing party requests an oral 

argument or an evidentiary hearing on the motion.  A General-Use Notice of Hearing on 
Motion form is available on the “Conservatorship of Adults & Minor Children” webpage.) 

Gather Other Supporting Documents: 

An answer to a motion may include other supporting documents, such as declarations, 
affidavits or exhibits. 

•  Make a copy of each supporting document, if any, for every other party in the 

conservatorship case, plus one copy to keep as a record. 

Your answer to motion, or your situation, may not require additional supporting documents. 

If you don’t know if your answer to motion or situation requires additional supporting 
documents, consult a lawyer.  The ND Legal Self Help Center can’t advise you. 

Service of Answer to Motion Documents: 

The opposing party must serve copies of their answer to motion documents on every other 
party, including the Protected Party, in the conservatorship case.  A completed and signed 
affidavit of service, declaration of service, or certificate of service is proof that service occurred. 

  Review service requirements for motions in Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  For more information about service requirements after a civil action has 
started, go to the Service link on the ND Legal Self Help Center website.  

  Obtain the address for service for every other party and the Protected Party.  If a party 
or the Protected Party is represented by a lawyer, obtain the address for service for the 
lawyer. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help 

Page 5 of 7 

Answer a Motion Checklist/Dec 2021 

  Arrange for service of copies of the following documents on every other party and the 
Protected Party.  If any party or the Protected Party is represented by a lawyer, arrange 
for service on the lawyer. 

  Answer Brief to Motion; 
  Declaration in Support of Answer Brief; 
  Other supporting documents, if any; and 
  Notice of Hearing on Motion, if applicable. 

  For each party and the Protected Party, get the completed and signed affidavit of 

service, declaration of service, or certificate of service from the person who served the 
answer to motion documents. 

If you, the opposing party, fail to serve a written answer fourteen (14) days or seventeen (17) 
days after service of the motion documents, the court will decide the motion on the documents 
filed, unless a hearing was requested within the deadlines to request a hearing. 

File the Original Answer to Motion Documents with the North Dakota District Court: 

The original of each of the answer to motion documents and the document(s) showing proof of 
service must be filed with the Clerk of District Court. 

*** Filing doesn’t meet the requirements for service.*** 

  Contact the Clerk of District Court’s office in the County where the moving party filed 

their motion documents for the following information: 

  Amount of the filing fee  $_________, if any, and how to pay. 
  Options for submitting answer to motion documents to the Clerk of District 

Court if you can’t file the documents in person. 

  Gather the originals of the following documents (make copies for your records): 

  Answer Brief to Motion; 
  Declaration in Support of Answer Brief; 
  Other supporting documents, if any; 
  Notice of Hearing on Motion, if applicable; and 
  Affidavit(s) of Service, Declaration(s) of Service, and/or Certificate(s) of Service 

showing service of copies of the motion documents on every other party and the 
Protected Party. 

  File the original documents with the clerk of court and pay the filing fee, if any.

Answer a Motion Checklist/Dec 2021 

The Court Decides the Motion: 

If either the moving party or an opposing party appropriately requested a hearing on the 
motion within the deadlines to request a hearing, the court decides the motion following the 
hearing. 

If neither the moving party nor an opposing party appropriately requested a hearing on the 
motion within the deadlines to request a hearing, the court decides the motion based only on 
the documents filed with the court. 

You’ll be notified in writing of the court’s decision on the motion.
