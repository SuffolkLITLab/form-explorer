      <pre>READ BEFORE COMPLETING THE PROPOSED AMENDED ORDER FOR 
JUDGMENT GENERAL-USE TEMPLATE (FAMILY LAW CASE) 

This General-Use template may be used to create your proposed Amended Order for 
Judgment when making a motion to modify a judgment in a family law case.  The 
modifications must be based on a written stipulated agreement between all parties. 

To complete this general-use template: 

1) 

2) 

3) 

4) 

Refer to the written stipulated agreement of the modifications to the Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment you want the Court to amend. 

Copy the EXACT wording of the paragraphs of the written stipulated agreement 
showing the agreed upon modifications. 

If you want to delete words from the paragraph, write the words EXACTLY as they 
appear, then cross through the words. 

If you are asking the court to add new paragraphs, copy and underline the EXACT 
wording of each NEW paragraph you want to add. 

You have two options to create your proposed amended order for judgment: 

Option One: Use this fillable form as is.  This form includes 4 blank pages in which you may type the 
words and formatting of your proposed amended order for judgment, including paragraph numbers.  
If your proposed amended order for judgment does not fit within the existing pages, use Option Two. 

CAUTION: The ND Legal Self Help Center webpage DOES NOT automatically save what you’ve 
typed into a form.  Remember to save the form as you go, so you don’t lose what you’ve 
typed. 

Option Two: Use a word processing program.  Use a word processing program, such as Microsoft 
Word, WordPerfect, Google Docs, or OpenOffice, to type the words and formatting of your proposed 
order for amended judgment, including paragraph numbers. 

Copy and paste the ENTIRE first page of this form, EXCEPT the italicized paragraphs in (parentheses), 
into the first page of your document.  Then, using the words and formatting from the rest of the 
form, type the words and formatting of your proposed amended order for judgment, including 
paragraph numbers.  Include the Clerk of Court date and signature block at the end. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure the formatting of the words you copied and pasted are the same as 
the formatting in the amended order for judgment general use template. 

Do not include this cover sheet when you serve or file the completed form.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING  
PROPOSED ORDER TO AMEND JUDGMENT (FAMILY LAW CASE) 
BASED ON A STIPULATED AGREEMENT 

ND Legal Self Help Center Staff and Court employees cannot help you fill out forms.  If you are 
unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer.  

There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  

Do not include these instruction sheets when you serve or file the completed form. 

A stipulated agreement is a document both parties sign stating they agree, or stipulate, there is 
no dispute concerning the specific matters involved. The stipulated agreement spells out the 
terms of the issue at hand, as well as stating the agreement of both parties. 

A proposed order is the order you would like the court to sign if your request is granted. 

If you are making a motion to modify a North Dakota state district court family law case, you 
will probably be required to file a proposed Order to Amend and proposed Amended Judgment. 
This general-use form is to assist you in creating your own Order to Amend. 

For information about how to make a motion, go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/making-
a-motion. 

IMPORTANT!  Review the parenting plan in the judgment you are asking the Court to 
modify.  In any motion to modify parenting time in a judgment, a parenting plan must be 
included as part of an amended judgment.  The parenting plan must include, at minimum, the 
following 7 provisions: 

1) Decision making responsibility for day to day decisions and major decisions such as

education, health care and spiritual development.
Information sharing and access, including telephone and electronic access.

2)
3) Legal residence of each child for school attendance.
4) Residential responsibility, parenting time, and parenting schedule for holidays, days off

from school, birthdays, vacation planning, weekends, weekdays, and summers.
5) Transportation and exchange of the child, considering the safety of the parties.
6) Procedure for review and adjustment of the plan.
7) Methods for resolving disputes.

The judgment must also identify the parent who may claim each child as a dependent for filing 
income taxes.

Order to Amend wStip F.L./Nov 2019 

If the parenting plan in the judgment you are asking the Court to modify does not include all 7 
provisions, or identify the child tax exemption, add each missing provision to your stipulated 
agreement and proposed Order to Amend.  Failure to do so may result in the motion being 
rejected by the court. 

(If you need to add any of the 7 provisions or the child tax exemption, see the General-Use 
template form for proposed amended order in a family law case that IS NOT based on a 
stipulated agreement.  The General-Use template form includes pages to add each of the 7 
provisions and the child tax exemption.)

Legal Self Help Center.  Go to https://www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the 
“Legal Research” section.) 

Body of Order: 

To complete the rest of this proposed order to amend, you will need to refer to your stipulated 
agreement and the final judgment in your case if it has not been amended, or the most recently 
amended judgment in your case. 

Copy the EXACT wording of the paragraphs of your stipulated agreement showing the 
modifications to your judgment or amended judgment.  Add additional pages if needed. 

Judge’s Signature Block: 

  Fill in the number of the Order for _________Amended Judgment (i.e., First, Second). 

  Fill in the number of the Order for (Let the _________ Amended Judgment) (i.e., First, 

Second). 

**DO NOT sign and date the (proposed) order to amend judgment.  If the court grants 
your motion, and uses your proposed order to amend judgment, the judicial officer 
assigned to your case will sign and date the order.  The proposed order to amend 
judgment is not effective until it is signed and dated by the judicial officer. 

Page Numbering: 

The pages of documents prepared for a civil action must be numbered. 

First: If you did not use paragraph 2, 3 or 4 for your (proposed) order to amend judgment, 
remove the unused page or pages. 

Second: Using the page numbering at the bottom of each page, number the pages of your 
(proposed) order to amend judgment.   

•  Count the total number of pages. 

•  Fill in the total number of pages in the second blank space of the page number on each 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the second blank space of the page 

number will look like this: “Page ___ of 4.” 

page.

[Page 3 of 4] 

Order to Amend wStip F.L./Nov 2019 

•  Now fill in the first blank space of the page number on each page. 

o  Fill in “1” in the first blank space of the page number on the first page. 

o  Fill in “2” in the first blank space of the page number on the second page. 

o  And so on for each page of your proposed order to amend. 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the page number on each consecutive 

page will look like this: “Page 1 of 4,” “Page 2 of 4,” “Page 3 of 4,” “Page 4 of 4.” 

Service: 

In general, copies of documents filed, or intended to file, with the court must be provided to 
the other parties in the civil action.  This is called service.  This includes serving the proposed 
Order to Amend. 

There are specific requirements for serving documents.  Rule 4 and Rule 5 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Civil Procedure give the requirements for service in a civil action. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed. 

For information about service and proof of service in a civil action, go to the Service link on the 
ND Legal Self Help Center website.
