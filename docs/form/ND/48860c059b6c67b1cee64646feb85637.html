      <pre>Instructions for Conservator’s Beginning Inventory Report 

Court employees can’t help you fill out this form.  
Don’t include these instructions when you file the completed forms. 

Purpose of Beginning Inventory Report 

The Beginning Inventory report gives the Court a summary of the protected individual’s 
financial wellbeing. It also assists the conservator(s) in planning and preserving the assets for 
the individual’s future benefit. 

Fillable forms are available on the North Dakota State Court’s website at ndcourts.gov/legal-
self-help/conservatorship. Attach additional pages as necessary to provide a complete 
inventory with any appropriate explanations.  

If new assets are discovered after filing the Beginning Inventory, use your judgment to 
determine if an updated beginning inventory report is required. Otherwise, report these to the 
court in the annual report along with any new assets acquired.  

If you’re a new conservator, review “Managing Financials” in the Guidelines for New 
Guardians Packet at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-guardianship. This guide will assist you 
in locating and marshaling the assets and managing the estate, and preparing for the annual 
reports. 

Cash is extremely difficult to account for and any significant amounts of cash should be 
deposited into a bank immediately. 

Save your receipts and bank statements so that you’re able to account for the expenditures 
made on behalf of the protected individual in the annual report to the court. 

Confidentiality of the Protected Individual 

Don’t include personal identification numbers such as birthdates, social security numbers, or 
financial account numbers in this beginning inventory report. Rule 3.4 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Court requires that reports can’t contain the following identification information:  

•  Social security numbers (use the last 4 digits only) 
•  Taxpayer identification numbers 
•  Full birthdates (use the year of birth only) 
•  Financial account numbers (use the last 4 digits only) 

If financial documents are attached, please completely cross out the full account numbers so 
the account numbers are unreadable.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
