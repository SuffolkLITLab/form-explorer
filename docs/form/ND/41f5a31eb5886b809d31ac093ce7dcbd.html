 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

There are a lot of benefits to volunteering. 
The  top  benefit  is  getting  to  help  an 
organization  that  you  support,  believe 
in,  maybe  even  are  passionate  about. 
Volunteering  provides  an  opportunity 
to  make  friends,  advance  your  career, 
increase  your  self-confidence  and  even 
improve your health. Studies have shown 
that  volunteering  can 
improve  your 
happiness and lower your stress.

wide  variety  of  tasks.  You  can  present

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

NICHE ACADEMY

This month’s database is another new one from the State Library and one that can be used without a 
library card. 

Niche  Academy  is  a  continuing  education  database  that  takes  a  new  twist  on  learning  courses. 
Unlike Universal Class, these self-paced courses are put together by librarians and others in library or 
information fields. 

Each  course  is  completed  at  your  own  pace,  and  you  do  not  need  an  account  to  take  them.  You 
can create a free account, so you can track your progress and the courses that you have taken. Your  
browser will remember your progress without an account as long as the cookies have not been deleted. 

Some of the courses are full classes and others are portals to get to the webinar or course that you  
are  looking  for.  We  are  trying  to  make  finding  professional  development  easier  for  all  people  
involved.  Some  of  the  courses  include  time  management  and  how  to  use Twitter.  Not  every  course  
is  to  promote  your  professional  life  but  can  be  used  to  enhance  your  knowledge  on  things  you  
aren’t as familiar with. 

Courses  are  being  added  to  this  database  on  a  frequent  basis,  and  we  are  still  developing  our  
academy.  So,  if  there  is  something  you  would  like  to  see  and  don’t,  let  us  know,  and  we  can  
look into creating a course for it. 

If you have any questions, please email us at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

FLICKERTALE SURVEY

In  order  to  make  sure  the  Flickertale  is  meeting  the  needs  of  our  readers,  we  would  like  to 
hear your thoughts on what you would like to see in future issues. This quick survey (only 3 
questions)  asks  which  sections  you  actively  look  for,  which  ones  you  skip,  and  any  topics  or 
ideas you would like to see included. Make your voice heard!

NORTH DAKOTA PUBLIC LIBRARY STATISTICS MAP

library  compared 

The  annual  North  Dakota  Public  Library 
Statistics  map  has  been  created  and 
is  available  on  our  website.  You  can 
to 
look  at  your 
others  across  the  state  using  metrics 
such  as  expenditures, 
local  support, 
programming,  and  more.  Use  these 
statistics to show your community where 
your  library  is  excelling  and  where  you 
could  use  their  support—the  map  is  an 
excellent visual advocacy tool!

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT: ZOMBIE PROGRAMS
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Look out, world, fall programming planning is just around the corner, and here are two of my favorite 
Zombie programs:

For children and teens, consider adapting the popular Humans vs. Zombie games to fit your library. 
Humans “hunt”  the  zombies  around  the  library  using  nerf  guns  or  marshmallow  shooters  (or  even  
balled  up  socks!).  If  a  zombie  is “shot,”  they  are  out  either  permanently  or  for  a  set  period  of  time 
(5  minutes).  If  a  zombie  touches  a  human,  the  Human  must  surrender  their  nerf  gun  and  become 
a Zombie. To add an extra layer, you can require that a zombie “feeds” every 5 minutes or else they 
“starve” and are out. There are many ways to play this game for your library!

For  adults,  consider  hosting  a  Zombie  Pandemic  Preparedness  Workshop.  The  Gwinnett  County  
Public  Library  hosted  this  program  in  2018  to  inform  adults  about  how  to  prepare  for  a  real-life 
pandemic; they encouraged adults to have emergency supply kits at home and spread information 
about  vaccines. This  wasn’t  just  a  health  seminar;  they  made  a  point  of  discussing  how  to  prevent  
and  survive  during  a  potential  pandemic.  By  marketing  this  program  as  a  “Zombie  Pandemic 
Preparedness” workshop, the library was able to draw the attention of zombie-enthusiasts everywhere.

PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS

The North Dakota State Library’s marketing webpage has a new look. Do you need flyers, posters, or bookmarks 
to promote the databases? We’ve got you covered! If you would like materials mailed to you, fill out the online 
order form and send it via e-mail to ndsltrain@nd.gov. If you need materials right away or just want to print your 
own, click on “Download promotional materials“ to download, save, and print the materials that are available. 

If you are unable to find the materials you need, or if you have changes you would like made to the existing 
materials, send an e-mail to ndslpa@nd.gov.

Register: http://bit.ly/2YOFg5L

In September, 2019, South Dakota Historical Society Press will release Equality at the Ballot Box: Votes for 
Women on the Northern Great Plains, a collection of essays about how women won suffrage rights in several 
Northern  Great  Plains  states  including  North  Dakota. Three  essays  in  the  book  focus  on  North  Dakota  
events:  “Quiet Voices in the Prairie Winds” by Barbara Handy-Marchello, “Kate Selby Wilder: Clubwoman, 
Suffragist, Temperance  Activist,  and  City  Commissioner”  by  Ann W.  Braaten,  and “Cora  Smith  Eaton  and 
North  Dakota  Woman  Suffrage,  1888-1897”  by  Kristin  Mapel  Bloomberg.  The  essays  on  North  Dakota 
suffrage are the first to be published on this state’s woman suffrage campaigns.

r.  Barbara  Handy-Marchello  is  co-chair  of  the  North  Dakota  Woman  Suffrage  Centennial  Committee 
which  is  planning  a  series  of  events  to  commemorate  the  centennial  of  the  19th  amendment.  She  will 
discuss the importance of commemoration as well as the work of the committee in raising awareness of 
the campaign for political equality for women. This webinar will also go over a few ways on how libraries 
can commemorate the event and what they could add to their collection to contribute to the celebration.

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH:  
NORTH DAKOTA AGRICULTURE GREEN AND GOLD
Submitted by Angie Houser

AUGUST 2019

Agriculture  is  a  way  of  life  in  North  Dakota.  From 
farming  to  ranching,  the  industry  is  a  staple  that 
keeps  the  economy  going.  In  this  State  Document, 
we get to see the planting to the harvesting of one 
of North Dakota’s most widely exported products — 
wheat. The video discusses why the wheat industry 
is such a large part of North Dakota’s economy and 
will  even  go  over  the  different  types  of  wheat  that 
are  produced.  The  video  was  made  in  the  1970’s,  so  a  lot  has  changed  for  North  Dakota’s  
economy since. You can be sure that wheat is still a staple today as much as it was 40+ years ago.

By Jessica Robinson

Middle-grade  fiction,  generally  marketed  towards 
kids  ages  9-12,  is  one  of  my  favorite  categories. 
Middle  grade  fiction  is  often  hilarious,  creative, 
and touching, usually with some sort of fantastical 
backdrop. This month, we’ll take a look at the some 
of  the  best  and  most  highly-anticipated  middle 
grade fiction of 2019.

is  Dan  Gemeinhart’s  The  Remarkable 
First  up 
Journey  of  Coyote  Sunrise,  a  classic  American  road  
adventure  featuring  a  young  girl  named  Coyote 
and  her  grieving  father,  wandering  the  country 
in  an  old  school  bus  after  the  death  of  Coyote’s 
mother  and  sisters.  After  that,  check  out  Hugo-
nominated  author  Yoon  Ha  Lee’s  Dragon  Pearl,  a 
rollicking  space  adventure  that  combines  Korean 
folklore,  space  pirates,  and  family  dysfunction  in 
the  most  exciting  way  possible.  Song  for  a  Whale 
interpreter  Lynn  Kelly  tells 
by  sign-language 
the  story  of  a  young,  deaf  tech-genius  named 
Iris  who  feels  disconnected  from  her  peers  and  
Blue  55,  a  whale  who  can’t  communicate  with 
other whales, which prompts Iris to devise a way to 
sing to him from three thousand miles away. Anne  
Ursu’s  The  Lost  Girl 
identical  sisters  
struggling to find their own identities when they’re 
separated for the first time in school, all while some 
mysterious force is making things disappear around 
town  without  leaving  a  trace.  The  Year  I  Didn’t  Eat 
by Samuel Pollen is a rare book focusing on a boy 
suffering from an eating disorder. As Max watches 
his  family  disintegrate  and  his  anorexia  grows 
increasingly  out  of  control,  he  feels  isolated  save 
for the mysterious ‘E’ who communicates with him 
through his geocache.

is  about 

Lisa  Graff’s  Far  Away  explores  the  idea  of  family 
betrayal  when  CJ  learns  that  the  aunt  who  raised 
her  in  a  traveling  psychic  show  has  been  lying  
life.  Sal  
about  her  mother’s  death  her  entire 
and Gabi Break the Universe is the first in a proposed 
series  by  Carlos  Hernandez,  centering  around  two 
rambunctious  kids  who  can  manipulate  time  and 
space,  and  do  so  with  increasingly  chaotic  results.  
Julia  Nobel’s  The  Mystery  of  Black  Hollow  Lane  is 

a  good,  old-fashioned  boarding  school  mystery, 
complete  with  a  box  filled  with  heirlooms  from 
a  missing  father  and  a  secret  society  that’s  
connected  to  the  school.  A  Good  Kind  of  Trouble 
by Lisa Moore Ramee is all about learning to fight 
for what you believe in. When Shayla enters junior  
high  and  finds  that  all  the  rules  she  knew 
have  changed,  she  joins  the  Black  Lives  Matter 
movement,  despite  the  powerful  pressure  around 
her  to  stay  out  of  all  trouble.  In  Bernice  Buttman, 
Model  Citizen  by  Niki  Lenz,  the  titular  Bernice 
Buttman is no stranger to both bullying and being  
a  bully,  but  when  her  mother  abandons  her  
with  her  aunt,  Bernice  decides  that  she  needs  to 
become  a  model  citizen  so  that  she  can  pursue  
her dream of becoming a Hollywood stuntwoman. 

M.M.  Vaughan’s  Friendroid  is  a  frenetic  look  at 
the  friendship  between  a  regular  young  boy 
and  his  eccentric  best  friend,  who  turns  out  to 
be  an  android  in  a  revelation  them  on  a  madcap 
adventure  to  discover  his  true  origins.  Lynda  
Mullaly  Hunt’s  Shouting  at  the  Rain  follows  a  girl 
named  Delsie  who  loves  to  study  the  weather,  
a pastime that begins to parallel the unpredictable 
storm  of  her  unusual  home  life  and  changing 
friendships.  In  My  Fate  According  to  the  Butterfly  
by  Gail  D.  Villanueva,  Sab  knew  that  she  was  
doomed  when  she  saw  a  giant  black  butterfly, 
a  clear  omen  of  death,  so  she  decides  to  use 
her  remaining  time  to  reunite  her  estranged 
father  and  sister.  Coming  out  this  month,  Pablo 
Cartaya’s  Each  Tiny  Spark  explores  a  complicated 
relationship  between  a  father  and  daughter  as 
seen  through  their  attempts  to  fix  an  old  car. 
Finally, Abby Cooper’s Friend or Fiction looks to be 
an  exciting  October  release,  featuring  a  troubled 
young  girl  who  creates  the  perfect  imaginary  
best friend and then accidentally brings to her life.

As we inch closer to fall, I start to reminisce about 
the  year.  That  makes  September  the  perfect  time  
to  take  a  look  at  some  of  2019’s  best  and  most  
highly anticipated historical fiction.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & 
LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCE ANSWERS 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This is the eleventh in a series of Flickertale articles 
that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s 
legal reference resources.

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The Flickertale. 

How do I sue someone in Small Claims Court?

Direct  the  patron  to  the  ND  Legal  Self  Help  Center 
website  and  scroll  to  the  Small  Claims  Court  section.

Following  are

resource  answers  given  by  North  Dakota  Supreme 
Court  Law  Library  and  North  Dakota  Legal  Self  
Help Center staff.

Do I have to hire an attorney?

No, individuals may represent themselves in North 
Dakota  state  courts.  However,  self-represented 
individuals  are  held  to  same  requirements  and 
standards as attorneys. 

Three recent North Dakota Supreme Court opinions 
requiring self-represented individuals to follow the 
same  rules  and  procedures  as  attorneys  are  State 
v. Hamre, 2019 ND 86; Barna, Guzy & Steffen, Ltd v. 
Johnson,  et  al,  2018  ND  205;  and  Bickler  v.  Happy 
House Movers, LLP, 2018 ND 177.

What are my legal rights related to ... ?

Direct the patron to the North Dakota Century Code 
General Index (print only) to find the laws and rules 
listed under the index section or sections related to 
the patron’s legal issue.

I am a landlord/tenant. What are my legal rights 
and responsibilities?

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 47-16 contains 
laws related to leasing or renting real estate.

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 47-32 contains 
laws related to eviction.

Legal Services of North Dakota has a Landlord-Tenant 
Law in North Dakota handbook on their website.

See  also,  the  Eviction  section  of  the  ND  Legal  Self 
Help Center website.

I have court ordered visitation but the other 
parent won’t let me see my child. What do I do?

Direct the patron to the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website and scroll to the Family Law section.

If the order was issued by a North Dakota state court, 
click on the Modify Visitation (ND Orders) link.

If  the  order  was  issued  by  another  state  or  tribal 
court,  click  on  the  Out-of-State  or  Tribal  Court 
Custody or Visitation Orders link.

The patron can review the laws or rules in the print 
version of the Century Code, if available, or online.

I was married in another state, can I get a divorce/
legal separation in North Dakota?

The  North  Dakota  Century  Code  is  available  at 
https://www.legis.nd.gov.  The  North  Dakota  Court 
Rules  are  available  at  https://www.ndcourts.gov/
legal-resources/rules.

See also, the Legal Research section of the ND Legal 
Self Help Center website

Direct the patron to the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website  and  scroll  to  the  Family  Law  section.  For 
divorce and legal separation information and legal 
research  resources,  click  on  the  Divorce  link  or  the

How do I get custody of my child?

  

 

 

If the parents of the child are married to each other, 
direct  the  patron  to  the  ND  Legal  Self  Help  Center 
website,  scroll  to  the  Family  Law  section,  and  click 
on the Divorce link or the Legal Separation link.

If  the  parents  of  the  child  were  never  married  to 
each  other,  direct  the  patron  to  the  ND  Legal  Self 
Help  Center  website  and  scroll  to  the  Family  Law 
section.  For  establishing  custody  and  visitation 
information  and  legal  research  resources,  click  on 
the Establishing Custody and Visitation link.

How do I get emancipated?

Direct the patron to the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website  and  scroll  to  the  Miscellaneous  section. 
For  emancipation  information  and  legal  research 
resources, click on the Emancipation link.

Spoiler  alert!  North  Dakota  does  not  have  an 
established  civil  court  process  to  ask  a  state  
court  to  emancipate  a  minor  child.  At  last  count, 
less  than  half  of  the  states  have  a  court  process  
for emancipation.

My father has dementia. How do I make decisions 
for him?

Guardianship  of  an  adult  is  a  court  process  to 
appoint  a  guardian  to  make  decisions  for  the 
adult,  such  as  healthcare  and  living  arrangements. 
Conservatorship  is  a  court  process  to  appoint 
a  conservator  to  make  financial  decisions  for  
the adult.
