      <pre>CHAPTER 12.1-31.2
DISORDERLY CONDUCT RESTRAINING ORDER

12.1-31.2-01. Disorderly conduct restraining order - Penalty.
1.

"Disorderly conduct" means intrusive or unwanted acts, words, or gestures that are 
intended to adversely affect the safety, security, or privacy of another person. For the 
purposes of this section, disorderly conduct includes human trafficking or attempted 
human   trafficking   as   defined   in   this   title.  Disorderly   conduct   does   not   include 
constitutionally protected activity.
A person who is a victim of disorderly conduct or the parent or guardian of a minor who 
is a victim of disorderly conduct may seek a disorderly conduct restraining order from 
any court of competent jurisdiction in the manner provided in this section.
A petition for relief must allege facts sufficient to show the name of the alleged victim, 
the name of the individual engaging in the disorderly conduct, and that the individual 
engaged in disorderly conduct. An affidavit made under oath stating the specific facts 
and circumstances supporting the relief sought must accompany the petition.
If the petition for relief alleges reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has 
engaged   in   disorderly   conduct,   the   court,   pending   a   full   hearing,   may   grant   a 
temporary   disorderly   conduct   restraining   order   ordering   the   individual   to   cease   or 
avoid  the  disorderly conduct   or  to  have  no  contact   with  the  person  requesting  the 
order. A temporary restraining order may be entered only against the individual named 
in   the   petition.  The   court   may  issue   the  temporary  restraining   order   without   giving 
notice  to  the  respondent.   Unless  otherwise  terminated  by  the  court,   the   temporary 
restraining   order   is   in   effect   until   a   restraining   order   issued   under   subsection 5   is 
served.
The court may grant a disorderly conduct restraining order ordering the respondent to 
cease or avoid the disorderly conduct or to have no contact with the applicant if:
a.
b.

A person files a petition under subsection 3;
The sheriff serves the respondent with a copy of the temporary restraining order 
issued under subsection 4 and with notice of the time and place of the hearing;
The court sets a hearing for not later than fourteen days after issuance of the 
temporary restraining order or at a later date if good cause is shown; and
The court finds after the hearing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
the respondent has engaged in disorderly conduct. If a person claims to have 
been engaged in a constitutionally protected activity, the court shall determine the 
validity of the claim as a matter of law and, if found valid, shall exclude evidence 
of the activity.

d.

c.

A restraining order may be issued only against the individual named in the petition. 
Relief granted by the restraining order may not exceed a period of two years. The 
restraining order may be served on the respondent by publication pursuant to rule 4 of 
the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.
A  disorderly   conduct   restraining   order   must   contain   a   conspicuous   notice   to   the 
respondent providing:
a.
b. Notice that violation of the restraining order is a class A misdemeanor punishable 
by   imprisonment   of   up   to  three   hundred   sixty   days  or   a   fine   of   up   to  three 
thousand dollars or both; and

The specific conduct that constitutes a violation of the order;

c. Notice that a peace officer may arrest the respondent without a warrant and take 
the respondent into custody if the peace officer has probable cause to believe the 
respondent has violated an order issued under this section.

If the respondent knows of an order issued under subsection 4 or 5, violation of the 
order is a class A misdemeanor. If the existence of an order issued under subsection 3 
or 4 can be verified by a peace officer, the officer, without a warrant, may arrest and 
take into custody an individual whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe 
has violated the order.

9. Whenever a restraining order is issued, extended, modified, or terminated under this 
section, the court shall transmit the order electronically to the bureau. Unless the order 
is a temporary order under subsection 4, the bureau shall enter the order electronically 
in the national crime information center database provided by the federal bureau of 
investigation, or its successor agency. The sheriff of the county in which the order was 
issued shall maintain and respond to inquiries regarding the order in the national crime 
information   center   database   provided   by  the   federal   bureau   of   investigation,   or   its 
successor   agency,   pursuant   to   bureau   and   federal   requirements.   Whenever   a 
restraining order is issued, the clerk of court shall forward a copy of the order to the 
local   law   enforcement   agency   with   jurisdiction   over   the   residence   of   the   protected 
party by the close of business on the day the restraining order is issued. Once the 
bureau,   after   consultation   with   the   state   court   administrator,   determines   and 
implements an electronic method  to notify the sheriff  of the county  that  issued the 
order,   the   clerk   of   court's   requirement   to   forward   the   order   to   a   law   enforcement 
agency will be satisfied.

10. Notwithstanding subsection 5 of section 11-16-05, a state's attorney may advise and 
assist any person in the preparation of documents necessary to secure a restraining 
order under this section.
Fees for  filing and service of  process may not  be charged to the  petitioner  in any 
proceeding seeking relief due to domestic violence under this chapter.

11.

12.1-31.2-02. Order prohibiting contact.
1.

If an individual who is charged with or arrested for a crime of violence or threat of 
violence,   stalking,   harassment,   or   a   sex   offense   is   released   from   custody   before 
arraignment or trial, the court authorizing the release of the individual shall consider 
and may issue an order prohibiting the individual from having contact with the victim. 
The order must contain the court's directives and must inform the individual that any 
violation of the order constitutes a criminal offense. The state's attorney shall provide a 
copy of the order to the victim. The court shall determine at the time of the individual's 
arraignment whether an order issued pursuant to this section will be extended. If the 
court issues an order pursuant to this section before the time the individual is charged, 
the   order   expires   at   the   individual's   arraignment   or   within   seventy-two   hours   of 
issuance if charges against the individual are not filed.
If the court has probable cause to believe that the individual charged or arrested is 
likely to use, display, or threaten to use a firearm or dangerous weapon as defined in 
section   12.1-01-04   in   any   further   act   of   violence,   the   court   shall   require   that   the 
individual surrender for safekeeping any firearm or specified dangerous weapon in or 
subject to the individual's immediate possession or control, to the sheriff of the county 
or chief of police of the city in which the individual resides.

2.

3. Whenever an order prohibiting contact is issued, modified, extended,  or terminated 
under   this   section,   the   clerk  of   court   shall   forward   a  copy  of   the   order   within   one 
business day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order. Upon 
receipt of the copy of the order, the law enforcement agency shall enter the order  in 
the  central   warrant   information   system   and   the   national   crime   information   center 
database provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency.
a. Once the bureau, after consultation with the state court administrator, determines 
and   implements   a   method   to   transmit   electronically   to   the   bureau   an   order 
prohibiting contact, the court electronically shall send the full text of the order as 
issued, modified, extended, or terminated in accordance with this section and any 
data fields identified by the bureau. This electronic submission will fulfill the law 
enforcement   agency's   requirement   to   enter   the   order   in   the   central   warrant 
information   system,   but   will   not   fulfill   its   requirement   to   enter,   maintain,   and 
respond to inquiries regarding the order in the national crime information center 
database provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency.
b. Once the bureau, after consultation with the state court administrator, determines 
and implements an electronic method to notify law enforcement about the order, 

Page No. 2

the   clerk   of   court's   requirement   to   forward   the   order   to   the   law   enforcement 
agency will be satisfied.

c. Once the bureau, after consultation with the director of state radio, determines 
and implements a method to enter the order into the national crime information 
center database provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor 
agency,   the   bureau   shall   enter   the   order   electronically   in   the   national   crime 
information center database provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its 
successor agency. This electronic entry will fulfill the law enforcement agency's 
requirement to enter the order in the national crime information center database 
provided by the federal bureau of investigation, or its successor agency, but will 
not fulfill its requirement to maintain and respond to inquiries regarding the order 
in the national crime information center database provided by the federal bureau 
of investigation, or its successor agency.

An individual who violates a court order issued under this section is guilty of a class A 
misdemeanor.
A  law   enforcement   officer   shall   arrest   an   individual   without   a   warrant   if   the   officer 
determines there is probable cause that the individual has committed the offense of 
violating an order prohibiting contact under this section, whether or not the violation 
was committed in the presence of the officer. A law enforcement officer who acts in 
good faith on probable cause and without malice is immune from any civil or criminal 
liability for making an arrest under this subsection.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
