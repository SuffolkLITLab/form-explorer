What Definitions Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet of Forms? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they’re NOT intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Adopted – An individual who was legally made the child of someone other than a biological 
parent.

A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide the Petition for Termination 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows guardianship cases in 
Juvenile Court to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the guardianship case, any party to the case may request that 
a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven (7) days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the guardianship case is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will 
issue findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the 
same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded 
(replaced) by a written order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the guardianship case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of fact 
and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for 
the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven (7) days after service of notice of the right to 
review. 

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen (14) days after service of the notice of the request for review.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
