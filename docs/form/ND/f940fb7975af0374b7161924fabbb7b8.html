INSTRUCTIONS FOR NOTICE OF HEARING ON PETITION 
TO START A CONSERVATORSHIP CASE 

ND Legal Self Help Center Staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out forms.  If you’re 
unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer. 

There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  Use at your own risk. 

Don’t include these instruction sheets when you file the completed form. 

THE “CONSERVATORSHIP OF ADULTS & MINOR CHILDREN” PAGE of the ND Legal Self Help 
Center website has additional information and resources. 

Review Chapter 30.1-29 of the North Dakota Century Code CAREFULLY! 

When you start a conservatorship case for an adult or a minor child in North Dakota state 
district court, a hearing is required. 

You may be required to give written notice of the reason for the hearing, and the hearing date, 
time and location.  (Sometimes, the Clerk of Court’s office will give notice of hearing for you.) 

If you’re required by the Clerk of Court’s office to give written notice of the hearing, you MUST 
arrange to have a Notice of Hearing document and a copy of the petition that starts the 
conservatorship case served on all other parties in your conservatorship case. 

IMPORTANT! 

This is a GENERIC Notice of Hearing form to start a conservatorship case.  Although every 
effort is made to keep the form up to date with the requirements of North Dakota laws and 
court rules, there is NO GUARANTEE that this generic form is legally sufficient, or will be 
accepted by every district court or judicial officer. 

Carefully review the laws or rules that specifically apply to conservatorship cases and the type 
of hearing.  As a self-represented individual, you’re entirely responsible for including the 
correct information on your notice of hearing. 

Review Chapter 30.1-29 of the North Dakota Century Code CAREFULLY! 

Review North Dakota court rules CAREFULLY!

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
