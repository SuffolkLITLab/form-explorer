 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

It’s my favorite time of the year. Holiday decorations are up or going up, Christmas music is playing,  
the  fire  is  roaring,  and  I’m  curled  up  in  front  of  it  with  a  good  book,  a  puppy  in  my  lap,  and  a  
delicious mug of tea. Since moving to North Dakota, I even like snow a little more. I used to say that,  
for  me,  the  perfect  snowfall  would  start  at  10:01  a.m.  on  12/24,  melt  at  12:01  a.m.  on  12/26  and  
only  fall  on  the  trees,  grass  and  roof.  I  do  love  a  tree  that  is  covered  in  beautiful  white  powdery  
snow.  I  still  wish  that  snow  didn’t  fall  on  the  streets,  sidewalks,  parking  lots,  or  drives,  but  I  think  
that’s a dream I should accept won’t come true. As I wrote last month, for me the month of November  
is  a  time  to  focus  on  gratitude  and  blessings. The  last  few  years,  in  December,  I  share  at  least  one  
picture  each  day  on  Facebook  that  makes  me  happy.  I  usually  explain  why  it  makes  me  happy,  but 
sometimes,  it’s  self-evident.  I  like  to  take  time  during  December  to  reflect  on  the  year,  on  what  
went well, what could be improved, and what I hope to achieve in the next year. I don’t usually set  
New Year’s resolutions or goals, but I do reflect on what I hope to accomplish. 

We’ve  had  quite  a  few  things  that  went  well  this  year  at  the  North  Dakota  State  Library.  One  of  
our  biggest  accomplishments  was  adopting  the  new  Standards  for  Public  Libraries.  Compliance  is  
required  to  be  eligible  for  Library  Vision  grants.  Our  Library  Development  team,  along  with  a  
dedicated  committee  of  librarians,  completely  rewrote  the  standards  in  such  a  way  that  we  
believe  that  all  of  our  public  libraries  will  be  able  to  meet  the  Developing  Level.  We  have  some  
libraries  that  are  working  on  meeting  the  Excelling  and  Future  Focused  levels.  I  look  forward  to  
visiting  the  libraries  next  year  that  have  met  the  Excelling  and  Future  Focused  levels  to  present  
them with either a certificate or plaque. 

One big change that our staff - along with the staff at ODIN and the public, K-12 and special libraries  
that  belong  to  ODIN  -  have  been  working  hard  to  prepare  for  is  our  migration  to  a  new  
circulation  system.  We  will  be  moving  to  this  new  system  on  December  5.  We  will  be  unable  to  
process  holds,  interlibrary  loan  requests,  or  renew  items  while  our  catalog  is  down  from  
December  5-11. We  are  excited  to  move  to  our  new  software  system  and  believe  that  patrons  will  
find it easier to use. They will also have many more options available in their patron accounts. 

We  resumed  ScanDays  in  2018  and  continued  them  this  year.  We  
had  5  ScanDays  this  year.  We  held  our  first  ever  ScanDay  at  the  
in  Bismarck,  New  
Capitol.  We  also  did  ScanDays  at  the 
Rockford,  Minot,  and  Langdon.  During  a  ScanDay,  members  of  the  
community  bring  in  up  to  10  items  to  be  scanned.  The  patron  is  given  
digital  copies  of  the  items,  and  the  State  Library  retains  a  digital  copy  
which gets added to Digital Horizons. If you’d like to schedule a ScanDay, 
please reach out to Trevor at tjmartinson@nd.gov.

Also in 2018, we joined the Digital Public Library of America through a partnership with the Montana 
State  Library  and  the  Big  Sky  Country  Digital  Network.  NDSL’s  collections  were  fully  ingested  in  
2018. The  State  Historical  Society  joined  in  April  of  2019,  and  the  Bismarck Veterans  Memorial  Public 
Library joined in August of 2019. You can visit http://bscdn.dp.la/ to view the collections.

We had our first reverse Librarian for a Day. Allison, a teen from 
Cass County, spent the day at the State Library learning about 
each department and the services we offer. Allison is Miss Teen 
Cass  County,  and  her  platform  is  reading  adventures.  She  has 
collected  books  and  volunteered  at  Margaret  Fraase  Public 
Library in Buffalo. We loved having Allison spend the day with us 
and hope to have more of these in the future. 

The  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  Council  and  the  State  Library  awarded  over  $195,000  this  
calendar  year  in  Library  Vision  grants.  In  the  spring,  we  awarded  $37,598  for  a  Non-Competitive  
Computer  Grant.  This  fall,  we  awarded  $157,478  for  Collection  Development,  Innovative  Partnership,  
and Technology Infrastructure Grants. We will be revising the Library Vision document and hope to have  
it to the Library Community in January or February for feedback. 

The  State  Library  partnered  with  NASA  to  bring  samples  of  lunar  rocks 
and  meteorites  to  public  libraries  across  the  state.  Marketing  Specialist 
BreAnne  Meier,  accompanied  by  a  variety  of  staff  members,  visited  23 
libraries  in  11  days.  Almost  1,600  North  Dakotans  took  advantage  of  
the  unique  opportunity  to  view  the  samples.  We  enjoyed  partnering  
with  our  public  library  community  to  provide  this  fun  event  to  North  
Dakota citizens. 

We  partnered  with  the  North  Dakota  Library  Association  for  the  Day  at  the  Capitol  event.  State  Library 
staff  ferried  people  to  the  Capitol  throughout  the  Renewal  and  Development  Conference  so  that  as  
many  librarians  as  possible  could  interact  with  their  legislators.  We  received  very  positive  feedback  
from  folks  during  the  ride  from  Bismarck  to  Mandan  and  many  expressions  of  gratitude  for  providing  
the opportunity to connect with a legislator. 

All  of  these  opportunities  would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  dedicated  and  hardworking  
staff  of  the  State  Library.  I  am  blessed  to  work  with  the  amazing  team  and  to  have  the  position  of  
State  Librarian.  As  we  head  into  not  only  a  new  year  but  a  new  decade,  the  State  Library  hopes  to  
accomplish  many  things.  Most  of  all,  we  hope  to  continue  to  partner  with  the  North  Dakota  Library 
Community  to  provide  the  best  service  possible  to  the  residents  of  North  Dakota!  I  wish  you  a  very  
happy  and  blessed  holiday  season,  and  I  look  forward  to  sharing  many  new  memories  with  you  in  the  
next decade. 

Did You Know:

In  2018,  there  were  4.55  circulations  of  public  library  materials  per  resident.  
Even more impressive? There were 11.55 circulations per cardholder.

Get Started Writing Your Strategic Plan

Strategic  Planning  is  an  important  part  of  every  library’s  growth.  This  plan  can  be  a  roadmap  as  you  
look  at  goals  for  your  library  to  achieve  in  the  next  3–5  years  to  better  serve  your  community.  It  is  
also  a  requirement  at  the  Developing  level  of  the  NDLCC  Standards  for  Public  Libraries.  Currently,  only  
68% of public libraries in ND have an up-to-date strategic plan. Writing a plan doesn’t have to be scary!

Some  simple  ways  to  start  the  strategic  planning  process  are  to  survey  your  community  and  conduct  
a  SWOT  analysis  (Strengths,  Weaknesses,  Opportunities,  and  Threats).  These  two  things  will  help  you  
identify what your community is currently receiving from the library, and the areas the library can work  
to grow.

From  there,  move  on  to  creating  goals  that  are  both  actionable  and  measurable.  The  objectives  
should  further  identify  the  steps  your  library  will  take  to  achieve  the  overall  goal.  If  you  need  help  
with  the  strategic  planning  process,  feel  free  to  check  out  our  resources  or  contact  your  Library  
Development Specialist.

2020 Census Bookmarks

The  2020  Census  is  almost  here,  and  we  want  you  to  be  as  prepared  as  possible  for  it.  So,  in  
addition  to  the  webinar  we  are  hosting  on  December  12th,  the  Census  Office  has  provided  us  
with  informational  bookmarks  that  we  will  be  sending  out  to  all  the  public  libraries  in  the  
state.  There  are  three  different  bookmarks,  and  each  library  will  receive  50  of  each.  If  you  find  
that you need more, please don’t hesitate to contact us about ordering additional bookmarks. 

If you have any questions, please email ndsltrain@nd.gov.

Letters About Literature

North  Dakota  students  in  grades  4-12  are  invited  to  enter  in  the  2020  North  Dakota  Letters  About  
Literature  statewide  reading  and  writing  competition.  The  contest  opened  December  2,  2019.  
Postmark submission deadline is February 14, 2020, or contestants can submit their work online. 

The  contest  asks  students  to  read  a  book,  poem,  or  play  that  inspires  them  or  shows  them  a  new  
way  to  see  the  world.  The  student  then  writes  to  the  author  (living  or  dead)  to  share  how  the  work  
affected his or her life. 

Letters  will  be  judged  in  three  levels:  grades  4-6,  grades  7-8,  and  grades  9-12. Winners  in  each  of  these  
levels  will  receive  $150  for  1st  place,  $100  for  2nd  place,  and  $50  for  3rd  place.  Both  classroom  and  
individual entries are welcome.

Guidelines, entry form, teaching guide, and promotional materials are available at library.nd.gov/letters.
html. The teaching guide provides activities and addresses how the program can dovetail with curriculum 
for reading and writing.

Questions may be directed to Shari Mosser at ssandwick@nd.gov or 701-328-4622.

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH:  
COPYRIGHT & RIGHTS STATEMENTS PLAYLIST
Submitted by Angie Houser

This  month’s  highlight  will  be  a  bit  different.  Instead  of  highlighting 
one video, we’d like to tell you all about a playlist that we have curated 
on  our  YouTube  channel.  This  playlist  is  called  Copyright  and  Rights 
Statements. The playlist is comprised of 10 videos that introduce what 
rights  statements  are,  introduce  the  basics  of  copyright,  and  even  go 
over fair use. Don’t miss out on this great resource!

Program Spotlight: Egg Carton Crafts
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Looking  for  a  way  to  use  up  all  of  the  donated  egg  cartons  taking  up  space  in  your  
supply  closet?  Have  no  fear!  All  your  patrons  need  are  scissors,  paint,  and  a  whole  lot  of 
imagination  to  have  fun  with  this  simple  craft.  Cut  up  each  carton  into  the  individual  egg 
pieces (a 1 dozen container would create 24 individual pieces). From there, paint them and add 
some yarn and googly eyes to create jellyfish, with some pipe cleaners, you can create bugs, or  
add  some  buttons  to  create  a  beautiful  flower  arrangement.  They  can  be  transformed  into  
game  pieces,  ocean-scapes,  wreaths,  mobiles,  and  boats!  These  ideas  and  more  can  be  
found here and here. 

Copyright On The Internet
Submitted by Shari Mosser

Libraries  are  big  proponents  of  sharing.  We  lend  out  our 
books.  We  give  out 
information.  We  connect  patrons  to  
ideas  that  help  shape  their  view  of  the  world.  Nothing  is  
wrong  with  sharing,  right?  Well,  if  you  don’t  have  permission  
to  take  and  copy  something  that  is  a  different  story.  In  a  
desire  to  quickly  gain  information  and  content,  information 
may  be  copied  and  distributed  without  permission  and  
infringe on others’ copyright.

The  US  Copyright  Office  has  a  new  video  in  the  Learning  Engine  series  called  “Copyright  on  the  
Internet.”  The  video  offers  a  list  of  the  steps  people  should  take  to  obtain  permission  before  using  
someone  else’s  work.  The  video  also  discusses  some  of  the  common  mistakes  people  make  when 
trying  to  avoid  infringement.  In  addition,  viewers  also  get  access  to  tools  they  can  use  to  discover  who  
holds a specific copyright.

Plus, KITTENS! Because kittens make everything better! So, watch and be informed and then share! Because 
great satisfaction comes from sharing with others.

DECEMBER 2019

By Jessica Robinson

Every  December,  Christmas  comes  a  little  early  
for me when the literary world explodes with lists  
of  the  best  books  of  the  year,  including  award-
winners,  bestsellers,  and  quirky  stand-outs.  This 
month  we’ll  take  a  look  back  at  2019  and  see  
what  we  still  need  to  add  to  our  reading  lists  
before 2020.

The  beginning  of  the  year  brought  us  When  You 
Read  This  by  Mary  Adkins,  a  romantic  modern 
take  on  the  epistolary  novel  from  a  debut  author.  
In  this,  a  PR  expert  inherits  the  task  of  getting  
his  colleague’s  book  published  when  she  dies 
tragically  young,  a  task  that  leads  him  to  her  
grieving older sister.

Chernobyl  was  one  of  2019’s  surprise  television 
hits,  a  moving  drama  about  the  horrific  1986 
Chernobyl nuclear accident. Fans of the miniseries 
should  cap  off  their  viewing  experience  with  
Adam  Higginbotham’s  Midnight  in  Chernobyl,  an 
in-depth  look  at  the  incident  and  its  devastating 
effects on the Soviet Union.

We  live  in  an  age  of  constant  distraction,  with  
the  ability  to  be  constantly  available  to  anyone  
and  endless  opportunities 
to  network  and  
rebrand.  In  Jenny  Odell’s  How  to  Do  Nothing: 
the  author  
Resisting

I  love  a  romance  novel  with  a  good  hook,  and  
Beth  O’Leary’s  The  Flatshare  has  a  great  one.  Tiffy 
Moore  needs  a  cheap  place  to  live.  Leon Twomey 
has  a  place  and  only  works  nights.  So  begins  the 
love  story  of  two  roommates  who  live  parallel  
lives in the same apartment until those lives begin, 
of course, to intersect in the best possible way.

In  Cambria  Brockman’s  Tell  Me  Everything,  Malin 
is  an  expert  at  ferreting  out  people’s  secrets  and  
a  professional  at  keeping  her  own.  She  uses  both 

of  these  skills  when  she  first  enters  a  prestigious 
New  England  college  and  befriends  a  close-knit 
group  of  friends.  However,  fast-forward  four  years 
to graduation and Malin’s secrets—and everybody 
else’s—come tumbling out with deadly results.

In the National Book Award Winner for Nonfiction, 
The  Yellow  House  by  Sarah  M.  Broom,  the  author 
tells  the  story  of  her  indomitable  mother  Ivory 
Mae,  who  bought  a  fixer-upper  in  New  Orleans  
in  1961.  Thus  begins  decades  of 
Ivory  Mae  
raising  her  large  family,  including  Sarah,  in  a 
troublesome  but  beautiful  house,  only  to  lose  it  
in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. 

Tracy  Chevalier  is  a  queen  of  historical  fiction

again.  Here,  we  follow  the 
journey  of  Violet  
Speedwell,  a  “surplus  woman”  of  the  Great  
War—women  who  were  considered  doomed 
to  a  life  of  spinsterhood  after  the  deaths  of  so  
many  men  in  their  generation.  Violet  moves  to 
Winchester  for  a  fresh  start,  falling  in  love  with 
the  beautiful  cathedrals  and  finding  a  place  in  a 
community  of  women,  only  to  find  that  another

Why and How Librarians Can Help with Census 2020 
Presenter: Kevin Iverson, North Dakota Census Office Manager
When: Thursday, December 12, 1:30-2:00PM (CST)

Register: http://bit.ly/2NRqqEk

Libraries  represent ‘trusted  organizations’  in  the  community  with  the  resources  and  the  opportunity  to 
education members of the public on the importance of the decennial census in the local community.

Librarians  also  have  the  opportunity  to  explain  the  ease  of  the  census,  just  10  questions  per  person,  
and  the  rules  for  privacy  and  confidentiality  for  personal  information  the  Census  Bureau  is  required  
to maintain.

Often  located  in  census  tracts  with  higher  proportions  of  traditionally  undercounted  populations,  
most  libraries  have  computers  and  WiFi  accessible  to  the  public.  These  assets  are  important  in  
completing the 2020 Census as it will be the first in which responses can be provided online.

According  to  a  George Washington  University  Study,  the  Federal  Government  obligated  $1,445,647,171 
within  the  state  of  North  Dakota  in  2015  using  data  based  on  Census  2010.  Per  capita,  that  works  
out  to  $1,910  per  year.  As  we  live  with  the  result  of  a  census  for  10  years,  that  works  out  to  $19,100  
per  person  or  $44,312  per  household  (average  of  2.32  persons).  A  decennial  census  off  just  0.1  percent  
would cost the state around $15 million.

Librarians,  working  with  local  complete  count  committees,  can  help  ensure  their  local  community  
is accurately counted and obtains its fair share of financial resources for the next decade.

MODIFYING CUSTODY OR VISITATION IN 
A NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT 
JUDGMENT

When  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  grants 
a  judgment  establishing  custody  and  visitation, 
the  district  court  keeps  the  authority  to  modify,  
or amend, custody and visitation.

A  motion  is  the  civil  court  process  for  asking  the 
North  Dakota  state  district  court  to  modify  the 
custody or visitation in the existing judgment.

The  Modify  Primary  Custody  (N.D.  Orders) 
webpage  is  a  good  place  to  start  legal  research 
when  a  parent  wants  to  change  which  parent 
has  primary  custody  or  to  change  from  equal  or  
shared custody to one parent with primary custody.

A parent with primary custody has more than 50% 
of the physical custody of the child.

MODIFYING  CUSTODY  OR  VISITATION 
IN  A 
JUDGMENT  OF  ANOTHER  STATE  COURT  OR 
TRIBAL COURT

When a court of another state or a tribal court grants 
a  judgment  establishing  custody  and  visitation, 
that court keeps the authority to modify, or amend, 
custody and visitation.

A  North  Dakota  state  district  court  can’t  modify 
the  custody  or  visitation  in  a  judgment  granted  
by  another  state  court  or  a  tribal  court  unless  
the  North  Dakota 
that 
both  courts  agree 
state  district  court  should  have  sole  authority  
over  the  judgment.    This  is  called  transferring  
jurisdiction to North Dakota state district court.

any  self-help  resources  available  specifically 
for  transferring 
jurisdiction  to  modify  a 
custody  or  visitation  in  a  judgment  granted 
by another state court or a tribal court. 

TRANSFERRING A NORTH DAKOTA CUSTODY 
OR VISITATION JUDGMENT TO ANOTHER STATE 
COURT OR TRIBAL COURT

When  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court  grants 
a  judgment  establishing  custody  and  visitation, 
another  state  court  or  a  tribal  court  can’t  modify 
custody  and  visitation  in  the  North  Dakota  court 
order unless both courts agree that the other court 
should have sole authority over the judgment.  This 
is  called  transferring  jurisdiction  to  another  state 
court or tribal court.

The  parent  who  wants  another  state  court  or 
tribal  court  to  take  over  jurisdiction  of  the  North 
Dakota  custody  or  visitation  judgment  will  need  
to  research  the  laws  and  court  processes  of  the  
other state court or tribal court.

For  legal  research  starting  points  for  other 
state  laws,  the  American  Association  of  Law

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
