Laws and Rules for Service to Start a Juvenile Court Action 

Chapters 27-20.1, 27-20.2, 27-20.3, and 27-20.4 of the North Dakota Century Code contain laws 
enacted by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly that apply in juvenile court actions. 

The North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure govern all juvenile court actions. 

Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure contains requirements for service of the 
summons to start a juvenile court action. 

Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure also applies to service of the summons to 
start a juvenile court action. 

Juvenile Court Actions 

Only certain types of actions can be brought to juvenile court. 

•  Delinquent child: A delinquent child is a child who has committed an act that is 

considered a crime and is in need of treatment or rehabilitation. 

•  Child in need of services:  A child in need of services is a child who has committed an 
offense that only applies to a child, such as truancy, consuming or possessing alcohol, 
disobedience of parental commands, or using tobacco, and is in need of treatment or 
rehabilitation. 

•  Child in need of protection:  A child in need of protection is a child who is “without 

proper parental care or control necessary for the child’s physical, mental or emotional 
health, or morals, and the need for services or protection is not due primarily to the lack 
of financial means of the child’s parents, guardian or other custodian.” 

•  Guardianship:  A guardianship of a minor child is a juvenile court process where a judge 
or judicial referee appoints a guardian to act in the place of a parent of the minor 
child.  A legal relationship is created between the guardian and the minor child, allowing 
the guardian to care for and make decisions on behalf of the minor child. 

•  Termination of Parental Rights: An order terminating parental rights of a parent 

terminates all the parent's rights and obligations with respect to the child and of the 
child to or through the parent arising from the parental relationship.

Definition of a “Child” for Juvenile Court Actions 

The child who is the focus of the juvenile court action must be either: 

1.  Unmarried and under the age of 18; or  
2.  Under the age of 20 and committed the delinquent act while under the age of 18 and 

unmarried. 

court action. 

Parties in a Juvenile Court Action 

Petitioner: The party who starts a juvenile court action with a petition is called the Petitioner.  

•  There may be more than one Petitioner, depending on the circumstances of the juvenile 

Respondent: The party who is served with a juvenile court summons and petition is called the 
Respondent. 

•  There may be more than one Respondent. 

See Rule 3 of the North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure for parties in a juvenile court action.   

Before a Juvenile Court Summons Can Be Served 

IMPORTANT: Petitions filed in juvenile court that aren’t filed by a state’s attorney, must be 
reviewed and approved by the juvenile court director, the juvenile court, or other person 
authorized by the juvenile court. 

Only if the juvenile court director, the juvenile court, or other person authorized by the juvenile 
court determines that filing the petition is in the best interest of the public and the child, a 
juvenile court summons can be served on all parties to begin the juvenile court action. 

Service of a Juvenile Court Summons and a Copy of the Juvenile Court Petition 

If the petition is allowed to be filed, the Petitioner may be required to prepare the Juvenile 
Court Summons.  The summons requires the Respondents listed in the petition to appear 
before the court at the time fixed to answer the allegations of the petition. 

Service to start a juvenile court action, also called service of process, requires delivery of the 
summons and a copy of the petition to each Respondent.  The Petitioner is required to notify 
each Respondent of the claims, and to give each Respondent time to respond. 

NDLSHC

NDRJP Rule 6 Service Info/Rev Jun 2021 

The summons and a copy of petition must be delivered in specific ways.  Rule 6 of the North 
Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure and Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure give 
the requirements for service to start a juvenile court action. 

Review the Sections of Chapters 27-20.2, 27-20.4, and 27-20.4 that apply to your juvenile court 
action.  If a North Dakota law tells the specific method of service that must be used, use that 
method of service. 

***Please note that, in general, copies of documents are served.  The original documents are 
filed with the juvenile court.*** 

Proof of Service tells the Juvenile Court How, When and Where Each Respondent Was 
Served and the Documents that were Served on Each Respondent 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  If proof of service isn’t filed, the 
juvenile court won’t act on your petition. 

***Please note that in juvenile court actions, it’s very common to have multiple Respondents.  
You’ll need to prove you served each Respondent.*** 

The proof of service to start a juvenile court action tells the juvenile court when, how, and 
where each Respondent was served. 

•  A certificate of service gives the court proof of service when a sheriff or other officer 

served the document(s). 

•  An affidavit of service gives the court proof of service when a person other than a sheriff 

or other officer served the document(s). 

Affidavit of Service forms for starting juvenile court actions are available in the “Juvenile Court” 
section in the “Service Instructions and Forms” link at the ND Legal Self Help Center website.
