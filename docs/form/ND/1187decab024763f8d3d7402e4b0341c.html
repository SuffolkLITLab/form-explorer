YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS ONLY IF: 

You have a North Dakota state district court judgment that established residential responsibility 
(custody) and/or parenting time (visitation); and 

•  You want the North Dakota state district court to change, or modify, the judgment so: 
o  A judgment that currently awards shared or equal residential responsibility is 

modified to award one parent primary residential responsibility, or 

o  A judgment that currently awards one parent primary residential responsibility is 

modified to award primary residential responsibility to the other parent; 

•  There is no domestic violence protection order, disorderly conduct restraining order, or 

no contact order currently in effect regarding either you or the other parent; 

•  You and the other parent are currently in contact with each other; 

•  You and the other parent completely agree on all modifications to the North Dakota 
state district court judgment, including the child support amount associated with the 
judgment; AND 

•  Neither you nor the other parent is represented by an attorney. 

IF YOU DON’T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHO MAY USE 
THIS PACKET OF FORMS 

If your situation doesn’t meet the requirements of who may use this packet of forms because 
you’re not in complete agreement on modifying primary residential responsibility, you may 
bring a contested (no agreement) motion to modify primary residential responsibility. 

•  A forms packet is available for contested motions to modify primary residential 

responsibility if it has been 2 years or more since the original judgment or the most 
recently amended judgment; or your current parenting plan allows for modification 
before two years have passed when an event or circumstance occurs. 

o  To determine if the forms packet is suitable for your situation, review the 
instructions and forms available at the www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/custody link. 

o  Scroll to the “Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility (Custody) Forms” 
section and click on the “No Agreement to Modify Primary Residential 
Responsibility” link.

If you want to modify which parent has primary residential responsibility and less than 2 
years have passed since the most recent judgment, or an earlier timeframe isn’t included in 
your parenting plan, neither the ND court system nor the ND Legal Self Help Center has a 
packet of forms for you to use. 

•  You may still bring a motion to modify primary residential responsibility. You’ll need to 
create all of your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer to create them for you. 

•  As a starting point for your research, A Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility 

Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/custody.  Scroll to the 
“Modifying Primary Residential Responsibility (Custody) Research Guides” section. 

If you want to modify residential responsibility that DOESN’T result in one parent with 
primary residential responsibility, neither the ND court system nor the ND Legal Self Help 
Center has a packet of forms for you to use. 

•  You may still bring a motion to modify residential responsibility. You’ll need to create all 

of your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer to create them for you. 

•  As a starting point for your research, a general guide to making a motion is a civil action 

is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/making-a-motion. 

CAUTION REGARDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 

Domestic violence protection orders, disorderly conduct restraining orders, and no contact 
orders generally don’t allow communication between the person protected by the order and 
the person the order is against.   

This packet of forms is designed to be used by parents who represent themselves and agree on 
all modifications to the current judgment.  The parents must be in communication with each 
other to share information, make decisions and complete the forms before filing with the clerk 
of district court.  If there is a domestic violence protection order or disorderly conduct 
restraining order in effect against either parent, you may not use these forms. 

If there is no domestic violence protection order or disorderly conduct restraining order in 
effect, but you’re concerned about the impact of domestic violence on you or your child(ren), 
this packet of forms may not be suitable.  Before using this packet of forms, you’re strongly 
urged to consult a lawyer and to contact a domestic violence intervention center in your area to 
help you navigate your situation.  CAWS North Dakota can help you find a domestic violence 
intervention center in your area.  The phone number is (888) 255-6242; the website is

MODIFYING PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH A WRITTEN 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARENTS 

(Please note that in 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “custody” to 
“residential responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

When a North Dakota state district awards residential responsibility in a family law case, such 
as divorce, legal separation, or other action to establish parenting rights and responsibilities, 
either parent may ask the court to modify which parent has primary residential responsibility in 
the existing case, if certain requirements are met. 

In general, there is a 2 year time limit before either parent may request modifications to 
primary residential responsibility.  However, an exception to the 2 year time limit is a written 
agreement between the parents for modification. 

This packet of forms allows parents to present their request to modify primary residential 
responsibility to a North Dakota District Court based on their written agreement. 

TEN FORMS IN THE PACKET (You’ll need ALL forms) 

Reminder: There is no guarantee that using these forms and following these instructions will 
result in the Judicial Officer granting your requested modifications to primary residential 
responsibility.  If you feel you need assistance, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.

STEPS TO MODIFY PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH A 
WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARENTS 

Step One: 
Review the Forms and Instructions; Gather Information; Make Decisions. 

Review the forms and instructions: 

Read these instructions carefully. 

Review the individual forms. 

Determine if the forms apply to your situation. If you don’t know if you should use this packet 
of forms, consult an attorney who is licensed to practice in North Dakota.   

Research statutes and case law: 

Use the links above to research how the statutes (laws) enacted by the North Dakota 
Legislature and case law apply to your situation. 

Gather information: 

 

•  At least one copy of the original judgment that established residential responsibility 
and/or parenting time, OR, if the original judgment has been amended, the most 
recently amended judgment. 

NDLSHC 

Page 8 of 22 

Modify PRR Stip Inst/Rev Aug 2020 

•  Financial information and documentation for child support calculations. 

o  You’ll calculate the child support amount for the parent who will have less than 

50% of the residential responsibility, if your motion is granted. 

o  Use the Financial Affidavit form to assist with gathering the financial information 

and documentation. 

Make decisions: 

Review the parenting plan in the judgment you’re asking the Court to modify.  In any motion to 
modify parenting time in a judgment, a parenting plan must be included as part of an amended 
judgment.  The parenting plan must include, at minimum, the following 7 provisions: 

1.  Decision making responsibility for day to day decisions and major decisions such as 

education, health care and spiritual development. 

2.  Information sharing and access, including telephone and electronic access. 
3.  Legal residence of each child for school attendance. 
4.  Residential responsibility, parenting time, and parenting schedule for holidays, days off 

from school, birthdays, vacation planning, weekends, weekdays, and summers. 
5.  Transportation and exchange of the child, considering the safety of the parties. 
6.  Procedure for review and adjustment of the plan. 
7.  Methods for resolving disputes. 

The judgment must also identify the parent who may claim each child as a dependent for filing 
income taxes. 

If the parenting plan in the judgment you’re asking the Court to modify doesn’t include all 7 
provisions, or identify the child tax exemption, the parents will need to reach an agreement on 
each missing provision, and add each missing provision to your Stipulated Agreement to Modify 
Primary Residential Responsibility form. 

The Stipulated Agreement form includes paragraphs for adding each of the 7 required 
parenting plan provisions and the child tax exemption.  

Decide which parent will be the moving party.  The moving party will complete and sign the 
Notice of Motion, Motion, Brief in Support of Motion, and Affidavit in Support of Motion forms.

After the Court reviews all of the paperwork, the Court might require a hearing.  If the Judicial 
Officer assigned to your case requires a hearing, you’ll be notified of the date, time and location 
of the hearing.  You must attend the hearing.  If you fail to attend the hearing the Judicial 
Officer may not grant your motion to modify primary residential responsibility.  If the Judicial 
Officer grants the motion, the Clerk of District Court will send a copy of an amended judgment 
signed by the Clerk of District Court. 

If the Judicial Officer doesn’t require a hearing and the Judicial Officer grants your motion 
based solely on the documents you filed, the Clerk of District Court will send you and the 
Defendant a copy of the signed amended judgment. 

Primary residential responsibility isn’t modified until the Judicial Officer signs an order 
amending the judgment and the Clerk of Court signs an amended judgment. 

If you need a certified copy of the amended judgment, you may obtain one for a $10.00 fee 
from the Clerk of Court's office.
