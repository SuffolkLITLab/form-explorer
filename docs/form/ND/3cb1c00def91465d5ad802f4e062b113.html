      <pre>Missing Persons – Guidelines for a Guardian 
 

Reporting 
Guardians and caregivers are mandatory reporters under NDCC §50-25.2-03 and must report 
conditions or circumstances that reasonably would result in abuse or neglect. Even if the 
guardian assumes that a long-term care facility or other party has reported the person missing, 
the guardian is still required to report to protective services. The North Dakota Bureau of 
Criminal Investigation states that “missing persons” includes a person who disappears under 
circumstances where they may be considered at risk. Particular care is exercised in instances 
where the missing person may be insufficiently prepared to take care of himself or herself. See 
their missing person policy for more information.  

rovide a copy of your Letters and be open in discussing the person’s abilities, both 

cognitive and physical, with the following agencies:  
1)  Report to Police Department/Sheriff’s Office 

  P

Should be done immediately. The statute for Missing Person Reports, NDCC §12-68, 
states that law enforcement must not refuse to accept a report even if the person under 
guardianship has been missing for only a short time, or when foul play is not indicated. 

a)  Give them a picture of the person along with a physical description and ID 

numbers, as well as a current list of their prescriptions.  

b)  Give the police all known contacts of the person, and let them know of possible 

places you think the person may be drawn.  

c)  Request a Silver Alert.  
d)  Ask them to ping the cell phone if the person has one. 
e)  The law enforcement agency will enter all of the information into federal and state-

wide databases.  
 

2)  Report to Protective Services or appropriate investigative agency: 

These contacts should be made immediately if the person has run away, absconded from 
treatment or a locked facility, has wandered away and is now lost, or any situation where 
the person’s location is unknown and is likely to be at risk.  

a)  Vulnerable Adult Protective Services can send the description to community 

partners, facilities, etc. where the person may turn up for assistance: 
https://fw2.harmonyis.net/NDLiveIntake/.  

b)  If the person has a developmental disability diagnosis, then Protection & Advocacy 

is the appropriate agency to contact: 701-328-2950.  

c)  Consider if other states’ protective services agencies should be notified.

3)  Contact Hospitals/Emergency Rooms 

Persons under guardianship may seek these services and institutions should be contacted 
in the communities to which the person may be drawn.  
 

Other Contacts to Consider 
The following contacts should be made at the guardian’s discretion, when circumstances indicate 
that the person not be located immediately. Share your Letters and physical description of the 
person, but do not share confidential information with these groups. Give them your direct 
contact information. 

1)  Service providers in the community, starting with the Human Service Zone staff – they 

will flag the person’s file. 

a)  Call emergency/homeless shelters in areas where the person may be drawn.  
b)  Consider Regional Human Service Center and county eligibility employees.  
c)  Notify the person’s pharmacy if appropriate; it may be important to know if they 

have or have not filled critical medications.  

d)  Consider other agencies that you think the person may contact. 

2)  Consider other parties such as legal representatives, family, or care providers. 

a)  The person may contact them, or they may have ideas of where to search.  
b)  Representative payees, conservators, and powers of attorney for healthcare should 

be informed of the situation.  
 

3)  Contact the person’s landlord; they will work with you on preserving the person’s 

belongings and may help watch for the person. There may be lease provisions to review.  

uardianship, Estate, and Benefit Protections 
1)  Secure the person’s personal belongings. 

  G

a)  Work with the court on disposing of belongings.  
b)  Consider use of storage or returning items to family. Consult NDCC §47-30.2 

regarding reporting of unclaimed property if appropriate. 
 

2)  Work with fiduciaries and financial benefit providers on suspending benefits and 
returning funds if necessary. The Social Security Administration and the Veterans 
Administration require guardians to notify them as soon as possible. 

a)  The person will retain eligibility, but monthly stipends may be suspended.  
b)  The agencies or county eligibility workers will help determine whether or not to pay 

the following month’s rent and other bills. 
 

Office of the State Court Administrator

3)  Report to the Court within 90 days.  

a)  Depending on the person’s history, the court may have a hearing to consider 

termination of the guardianship.  

b)  Include information on whether or not the search efforts have been exhausted. 
There are fillable forms available on the self-help site: www.ndcourts.gov.  
 

4)  Other:  

a)  Guardianship fees should be reasonable and commensurate with services provided. 
If no services are provided, no fee should be charged even if the case is not yet 
terminated.  

b)  Guardians are required to safeguard the person’s rights and may intervene only if 
necessary for the safety of the person under guardianship, NDCC §30.1-28-12(5) 
paragraphs (b) and (c).) Consider this guidance when making decisions for people 
that may have relocated to a different city or state.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
