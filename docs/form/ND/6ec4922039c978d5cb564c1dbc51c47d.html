29-32.1-01. Remedy - To whom available - Conditions.
1.

A  person   who   has   been   convicted   of   and   sentenced   for   a   crime   may   institute   a 
proceeding applying for relief under this chapter upon the ground that:
a.

The conviction was obtained or the sentence was imposed in violation of the laws 
or the Constitution of the United States or of the laws or Constitution of North 
Dakota;
The conviction was obtained under a statute that is in violation of the Constitution 
of the United States or the Constitution of North Dakota, or that the conduct for 
which the applicant was prosecuted is constitutionally protected;
The court that rendered the judgment  of conviction and sentence was without 
jurisdiction over the person of the applicant or the subject matter;
The sentence is not authorized by law;
Evidence, not previously presented and heard, exists requiring vacation of the 
conviction or sentence in the interest of justice;
A significant change in substantive or procedural law has occurred which, in the 
interest of justice, should be applied retrospectively;
The   sentence   has   expired,   probation   or   parole   or   conditional   release   was 
unlawfully   revoked,   or   the   applicant   is   otherwise   unlawfully   in   custody   or 
restrained; or
The   conviction   or   sentence   is   otherwise   subject   to   collateral   attack   upon   any 
ground of alleged error available before July 1, 1985, under any common law, 
statutory or other writ, motion, proceeding, or remedy.

2.

Except as provided in subsection 3, an application for relief under this chapter must be 
filed within two years of the date the conviction becomes final. A conviction becomes 
final for purposes of this chapter when:
a.
b.

The time for appeal of the conviction to the North Dakota supreme court expires;
If an appeal was taken to the North Dakota supreme court, the time for petitioning 
the United States supreme court for review expires; or
If review was sought in the United States supreme court, the date the supreme 
court issues a final order in the case.

c.

3.

a. Notwithstanding subsection 2, a court may consider an application for relief under 

this chapter if:
(1) The petition alleges the existence of newly discovered evidence, including 
DNA evidence, which if proved and reviewed in light of the evidence as a 
whole,   would   establish   that   the   petitioner   did   not   engage   in   the   criminal 
conduct for which the petitioner was convicted;

(2) The   petitioner   establishes   that   the   petitioner   suffered   from   a   physical 
disability or mental disease that precluded timely assertion of the application 
for relief; or

(3) The petitioner asserts a new interpretation of federal or state constitutional 
or statutory law by either the United States supreme court or a North Dakota 
appellate   court   and   the   petitioner   establishes   that   the   interpretation   is 
retroactively applicable to the petitioner's case.

An application under this subsection must be filed within two years of the date the 
petitioner discovers or reasonably should have discovered the existence of the 
new   evidence,   the   disability   or   disease   ceases,   or   the   effective   date   of   the 
retroactive application of law.

4.

A proceeding under this chapter is not a substitute for and does not affect any remedy 
incident   to   the   prosecution   in   the   trial   court   or   direct   review   of   the   judgment   of 
conviction   or   sentence   in   an   appellate   court.   Except   as   otherwise   provided   in   this 
chapter, a proceeding under this chapter replaces all other common law, statutory, or 
other remedies available before July 1, 1985, for collaterally challenging the validity of 
the judgment of conviction or sentence. It is to be used exclusively in place of them. A 

Page No. 1

proceeding   under   this   chapter   is   not   available   to   provide   relief   for   disciplinary 
measures, custodial treatment, or other violations of civil rights of a convicted person 
occurring after the imposition of sentence.

29-32.1-02. Exercise of original jurisdiction in habeas corpus.
A court in which original jurisdiction in habeas corpus is vested may entertain a habeas 
corpus proceeding under chapter 32-22 or this chapter. This chapter, to the extent appropriate, 
governs the proceeding.

4.

2.
3.

29-32.1-03. Commencement of proceedings - Filing - Service.
1.

A proceeding is commenced by filing an application with the clerk of the court in which 
the conviction and sentence took place. The state must be named as respondent. No 
filing fee is required.
An application may be filed at any time.
If an application is filed before the time for appeal from the judgment of conviction or 
sentence has expired, the court, on motion of the applicant, may extend the time for 
appeal until a final order has been entered in the proceeding under this chapter.
If an application is filed while an appeal or other review is pending, the appellate court, 
on motion of either party or on its own motion, may defer further action on the appeal 
or other review until the determination of the application by the trial court or may order 
the application certified and consolidated with the pending appeal or other review.
5. Upon receipt of an application, the clerk shall forthwith file it, make an entry in the 
appropriate docket, and deliver a copy to the state's attorney of the county in which the 
criminal action was venued.
If the applicant is not represented by counsel, the clerk shall notify the applicant that 
assistance of counsel may be available to persons unable to obtain counsel. The clerk 
shall also inform the applicant of the procedure for obtaining counsel.
The application may be considered by any judge of the court in which the conviction 
took place.

6.

7.

29-32.1-04. Application - Contents.
1.

2.

The application must identify the proceedings in which the applicant was convicted 
and sentenced, give the date of the judgment and sentence complained of, set forth a 
concise   statement   of   each   ground   for   relief,   and   specify   the   relief   requested. 
Argument, citations, and discussion of authorities are unnecessary.
The   application   must   identify   all   proceedings   for   direct   review   of   the   judgment   of 
conviction   or   sentence   and   all   previous   postconviction   proceedings   taken   by   the 
applicant   to   secure   relief   from   the   conviction   or   sentence,   the   grounds   asserted 
therein,   and   the   orders   or   judgments   entered.   The   application   must   refer   to   the 
portions of the record of prior proceedings pertinent to the alleged grounds for relief. If 
the cited record is not in the files of the court, the applicant shall attach that record or 
portions thereof to the application or state why it is not attached. Affidavits or other 
material supporting the application may be attached, but are unnecessary.

29-32.1-05.   Counsel   at   public   expense  -  Applicant's   inability   to   pay   costs   and 

litigation expenses.

1.

If an applicant requests counsel and the court is satisfied that the applicant is indigent, 
counsel shall be provided at public expense to represent the applicant.

2. Costs and expenses incident to a proceeding under this chapter, including fees for 
counsel provided at public expense, must be reimbursed in the same manner as are 
costs and expenses incurred in the defense of criminal prosecutions.

29-32.1-06. Response by answer or motion.
1. Within thirty days after the docketing of an application or within any further time the 

court may allow, the state shall respond by answer or motion.

4.

2.

3.

The state may move to dismiss an application on the ground that it is evident from the 
application that the applicant is not entitled to postconviction relief and no purpose 
would be served by any further proceedings. In considering the motion, the court shall 
take account of substance regardless of defects of form.
The following defenses may be raised by answer or motion:
a.

The   claim   has   been   fully   and   finally   determined   in   a   previous   proceeding   in 
accordance with subsection 1 of section 29-32.1-12; or
The application constitutes misuse of process in accordance with subsection 2 of 
section 29-32.1-12.

b.

29-32.1-07. Amended and supplemental pleadings.
1.

The court may make appropriate orders allowing amendment of the application or any 
pleading or motion, allowing further pleadings or motions, or extending the time for 
filing any pleading.
At any time before the entry of judgment, the court, for good cause, may grant leave to 
withdraw the application without prejudice.

29-32.1-08. Discovery.
The court, for good cause, may grant leave to either party to use the discovery procedures 
available in criminal or civil proceedings. Discovery procedures may be used only to the extent 
and in the manner the court has ordered or to which the parties have agreed.

29-32.1-09. Summary disposition.
1.

The court, on its own motion, may enter a judgment denying a meritless application on 
any and all issues raised in the application before any response by the state. The court 
also   may   summarily   deny   a   second   or   successive   application   for   similar   relief   on 
behalf of the same applicant and may summarily deny any application when the issues 
raised in the application have previously been decided by the appellate court in the 
same case.
The court, on its own motion, may dismiss any grounds of an application which allege 
ineffective   assistance   of   postconviction   counsel.   An   applicant   may   not   claim 
constitutionally ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel in proceedings under 
this chapter.
The court may grant a motion by either party for summary disposition if the application, 
pleadings, any previous proceeding, discovery, or other matters of record show that 
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a 
judgment as a matter of law.
If   an   evidentiary   hearing   is   necessary,   the   court   may   determine   which   issues   of 
material fact are in controversy and appropriately restrict the hearing.

29-32.1-10. Hearing - Evidence.
1.

Evidence must be presented in open court, recorded, and preserved as part of the 
record of the proceedings.
A  certified   record   of   previous   proceedings   may  be   used   as   evidence   of   facts   and 
occurrences established therein, but use of that record does not preclude either party 
from offering additional evidence as to those facts and occurrences.
The   deposition   of   a   witness   may   be   received   in   evidence,   without   regard   to   the 
availability of the witness, if written notice of intention to use the deposition was given 
in   advance   of   the   hearing   and   the   deposition   was   taken   subject   to   the   right   of 
cross-examination.

29-32.1-11. Findings of fact - Conclusions of law - Order.
1.

The court shall make explicit findings on material questions of fact and state expressly 
its conclusions of law relating to each issue presented.

Page No. 3

2.

3.

If   the  court   rules   that   the  applicant   is   not   entitled   to   relief,   its   order   must   indicate 
whether the decision is based upon the pleadings, is by summary disposition, or is the 
result of an evidentiary hearing.
If   the   court   finds   in   favor   of   the   applicant,   it   shall   enter   an   appropriate   order   with 
respect   to   the   conviction   or   sentence   in   the   previous   proceedings,   and   any 
supplementary orders as to rearraignment, retrial, custody, bail, discharge, correction 
of sentence, or other matters that may be necessary and proper.

2.

29-32.1-12. Affirmative defenses - Res judicata - Misuse of process.
1.

An application for postconviction relief may be denied on the ground that the same 
claim or claims were fully and finally determined in a previous proceeding.
A court may deny relief on the ground of misuse of process. Process is misused when 
the applicant:
a.

Presents a claim for relief which the applicant inexcusably failed to raise either in 
a proceeding leading to judgment of conviction and sentence or in a previous 
postconviction proceeding; or
Files multiple applications containing a claim so lacking in factual support or legal 
basis as to be frivolous.

b.

3. Res judicata and misuse of process are affirmative defenses to be pleaded by the 
state. The burden of proof is also upon the state, but, as to any ground for relief which, 
by statute or rule of court, must be presented as a defense or objection at a specified 
stage   of   a   criminal   prosecution,   the   applicant   shall   show   good   cause   for 
noncompliance with the statute or rule.

29-32.1-13. Reimbursement of costs and litigation expenses.
If   an   application   is   denied,   the   state   may   move   for   an   order   requiring   the   applicant   to 
reimburse the state for costs and for litigation expenses paid for the applicant from public funds. 
The court may grant the motion if it finds that the applicant's claim is so completely lacking in 
factual support or legal basis as to be frivolous or that the applicant has deliberately misused 
process.   The   court   may   require   reimbursement   of   costs   and   expenses   only   to   the   extent 
reasonable in light of the applicant's present and probable future financial resources.

29-32.1-14. Review.
A final judgment entered under this chapter may be reviewed by the supreme court of this 

state upon appeal as provided by rule of the supreme court.

29-32.1-15. Motion for DNA testing not available at trial.
1. Without limitation on a court's authority to order discovery under section 29-32.1-08, a 
person convicted of a crime may make a motion for the performance of forensic DNA 
testing to demonstrate the person's actual innocence if:
a.

The testing is to be performed on evidence secured in relation to the trial which 
resulted in the conviction; and
The evidence was not subject to the testing because either the technology for the 
testing was not available at the time of the trial or the testing was not available as 
evidence at the time of the trial.

b.

2.

3.

A person who makes a motion under subsection 1 must present a prima facie case 
that:
a.
b.

Identity was an issue in the trial; and
The evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to 
establish that it has not been substituted, tampered with, replaced, or altered in 
any material aspect.

The court shall order that the testing be performed if:
a.
b.

A prima facie case has been established under subsection 2;
The testing has the scientific potential to produce new, noncumulative evidence 
materially relevant to the defendant's assertion of actual innocence; and

Page No. 4

c.

The testing requested employs a scientific method generally accepted within the 
relevant scientific community. The court shall impose reasonable conditions on 
the testing designed to protect the state's interests in the integrity of the evidence 
and the testing process.
