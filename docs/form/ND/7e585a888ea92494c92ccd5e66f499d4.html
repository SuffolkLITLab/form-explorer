Guardianship or Conservatorship of an Adult to North Dakota 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms. 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov.

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for Part 2 of asking a North Dakota state district court to accept the transfer of a 
guardianship and/or conservatorship established by another state court.  There is no guarantee 
that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The 
Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or information 
provided.  Use at your own risk. 

Part 2: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 1 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

You may use these forms if: 

1.  You’re the guardian and/or conservator of an adult who was appointed by 

another (non-North Dakota) state court.  You were appointed when the ward 
and/or protected person was 18 years old or older. 

AND 

2.  You want North Dakota to accept transfer of the entire guardianship and/or 

conservatorship of another state, so a North Dakota state district court will have 
all authority over the guardianship and/or conservatorship.  This is called 
transferring jurisdiction, or accepting transfer of jurisdiction. 

This is a 5 Part process.  ALL 5 Parts MUST be completed. 

Transferring jurisdiction of a guardianship and/or conservatorship case from the court of 
another state to a North Dakota state district court is a 5 Part process. 

You must complete all 5 Parts to transfer jurisdiction of the entire guardianship 
and/or conservatorship to a North Dakota state district court. 

Part 1. You Work with the Other State Court to Get a Provisional Order Transferring 

Jurisdiction of the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship to North Dakota. 

You must work directly with the other state to fulfill the other state court’s process for 
obtaining a provisional order transferring jurisdiction of the entire guardianship and/or 
conservatorship case to a North Dakota state district court. 

The North Dakota state court system and the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center can’t 
assist you with Part 1 of the process. 

Part 2. You Petition the North Dakota State District Court for a Provisional Order to 

Accept the Transfer of Jurisdiction of the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship 
from the Other State Court. 

These are the instructions for the set of forms to complete Part 2. 

   

Part 2: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 2 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

Part 3. If the North Dakota State District Court Issues a Provisional Order to Accept 
Transfer of Jurisdiction, You Work with the Other State Court to Get a Final 
Order Transferring Jurisdiction to North Dakota and Terminating the Other 
State’s Guardianship and/or Conservatorship. 

You must work directly with the other state to fulfill the other state court’s process for 
obtaining a final order transferring jurisdiction of the entire guardianship and/or 
conservatorship case to a North Dakota state district court. 

The North Dakota state court system and the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center can’t 
assist you with Part 3 of the process. 

Part 4. After the Other State Issues a Final Order Transferring Jurisdiction to North 

Dakota, Make a Motion for a Final Order to Accept Transfer of Jurisdiction of the 
Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Case to North Dakota. 

Instructions and a set of forms for completing Part 4 are available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship/transfer. 

Part 5. If the North Dakota State District Court Issues a Final Order to Accept Transfer of 
Jurisdiction, Within 90 Days of the Final Order, the Court Must Determine 
Whether the Guardianship and/or Conservatorship Needs to be Modified to 
Conform to North Dakota’s Laws. 

Instructions and forms for completing Part 5 are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-
help/conservatorship/transfer.

Steps for Completing Part 2 of the 5 Part Process 

These forms allow one guardian or one conservator to petition the North Dakota state 
district court on their own. 

These forms also allow a co-guardian or co-conservator to join the petition with the 
guardian or conservator, as long as they were appointed in the same case by the same 
court of another state.  

Step One: Complete Part 1 of the 5 Part Process; Review the Forms and 
Instructions; Research the Law; Gather Information; Start the Rule 59 
Requirements. 

You must complete Part 1 BEFORE you can start Part 2 of the Process. 

If you haven’t already completed Part 1 of the transfer process, you must do so before starting 
Part 2. 

You must work directly with the court of the other state to complete Part 1.  ND Court System 
staff and ND Legal Self Help Center staff can’t provide any assistance with Part 2. 

If you need assistance with Part 1, check to see if the other state court system has a legal self-
help program that can provide information about that state court’s processes.  Check for legal 
service providers in the other state who may have information available.  Check with the other 
state’s Bar Association for attorney referral programs that can help you find an attorney to hire 
to represent you. 

Review ALL Forms and Instructions for the 5 Part Process: 

Read the instructions for ALL 5 Parts carefully.  Review ALL of the individual forms.  Determine if 
the forms apply to your situation. 

If you don’t know if you should use this packet of forms, consult a lawyer who is licensed to 
practice in North Dakota. 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you make any decisions about 
these forms.

Optional Step Two(a): Complete the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) Request and 
(Proposed)  Order For Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem Forms. 

A Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) is a lawyer appointed by the North Dakota state district court to 
advocate for the best interests of the ward or the protected person.  The GAL is paid by the 
ward’s or protected person’s estate. 

Appointing a GAL is optional when the North Dakota State District Court is deciding whether to 
accept transfer of jurisdiction of a guardianship and/or conservatorship from another state. 

If you decide to ask the Court to appoint a GAL for the ward or protected person, you’ll first 
need to find a GAL. 

No list of GAL’s specifically for guardianships or conservatorships of adults exists through the 
North Dakota Court System.  However, a GAL roster for use in child custody proceedings may 
be useful as a starting point.

• 

If you arranged for service of your petition documents by mail, they have 17 days to

o  The date of service is the date the petition documents were mailed to the person

Part 2: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 15 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day the person was served; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If the persons required to receive notice don’t serve and file a written answer to your petition 
or request a hearing, the judge may consider your petition unopposed. 

Step Six(a): If the Petition will be Decided on ONLY the Documents Filed with 
the Court, the Judge Reviews the Documents Without Holding a Hearing. 

After the deadline passes for answer to petition documents and request for hearing 
documents to be served and filed, if no one requested a hearing, the judge assigned to your 
case will review the documents filed by you and persons required to receive notice of your 
petition. 

Your petition will be decided only on the documents filed with the court. No hearing will be 
held. 

If no person required to receive notice served and filed an answer to your petition, your 
petition documents are still required to prove you meet the requirements for North Dakota to 
accept the transfer jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or conservatorship from another state. 

Step Six(b): If Anyone Requested a Hearing, Attend the Hearing. 

You must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  If you don’t go to court, the judge won’t 
grant your petition.  Be sure to be on time.  Bring to the hearing: 

•  Your copies of the completed forms you filed with the Clerk of District Court’s office; 
•  Any evidence you want the Judge to know about; and 
•  Any witnesses you want to talk to the Judge. 

The Judge won’t allow you to use as evidence (and will not look at) any documents (such as 
letters, notes, or statements) written by someone other than yourself unless the person who 
wrote the document is at the hearing. 

Part 2: NDCC § 28-35-16/NDLSHC 

[Page 16 of 17] 

Rev Apr 2022 

If you want the judge to hear what someone else has to say about your case, that person MUST 
be at the hearing – YOU can’t tell the judge what that person said or has to say. You may force 
someone to attend the hearing by serving a subpoena on that person prior to the date of the 
hearing. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide and a Subpoena Informational Guide are available at 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” Section. 

Step Seven: The Judge Decides Whether to Grant a Provisional Order to Accept 
Transfer of Jurisdiction to North Dakota from Another State. 

If the Judge DOESN’T Grant Your Petition to Accept Transfer: 

If the Judge doesn’t grant your petition to accept transfer of jurisdiction of the guardianship 
and/or conservatorship from another state, the other state court keeps their authority over the 
guardianship and or conservatorship. 

If the Judge GRANTS Your Petition to Accept Transfer: 

If the Judge grants your petition to accept transfer of jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or 
conservatorship from another state, the Judge will sign a provisional order accepting the 
transfer of jurisdiction from the other state court. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign your proposed provisional order, or may 

decide to sign a different proposed provisional order. 

The provisional order isn’t a final order.  You must complete Part 3 and Part 4 of the transfer 
process before jurisdiction of the guardianship and/or conservatorship is accepted for transfer 
by the North Dakota State District Court. 

 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.
