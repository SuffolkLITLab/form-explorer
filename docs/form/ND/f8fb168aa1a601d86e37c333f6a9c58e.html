      <pre>Instructions for Notice and Motion for Change of Venue 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you are 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if these forms 
and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

• 

If you would like to learn more about finding a lawyer to represent you, go to 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota state district court to change the venue (North Dakota 
county) in an existing guardianship of an adult.  There is no guarantee that all judges and courts 
will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The Center isn’t responsible 
for any consequences that may result from the forms or information provided. 

Use at your own risk. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

for guardianship of an adult. 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-28-13 relates to venue in District Court proceedings 
after a guardian for an adult is appointed. 

If you’re a Guardian representing yourself, you complete and sign the forms.  If you’re unsure 
how to proceed or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation, consult an attorney.

If you arrange to have the copies served hand-delivered, the individual who hand-delivers the 
copies completes Form 6: Affidavit of Personal Service.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
