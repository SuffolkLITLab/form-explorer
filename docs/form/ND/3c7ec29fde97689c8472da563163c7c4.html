As  mentioned  in  last  month’s  Flickertale,  the  State 
Library 
is  currently  undergoing  a  reorganization.  
We  wanted  to  share  the  changes  with  you  so  that  
you  know  who  to  contact  for  what.  Several  staff  
members  have  shifted 
into  new  positions.  We  
expect  the  changes  to  be  completed  by  July  1,  
2020,  so  some  staff  members  will  be  straddling  
two  positions  for  a  bit.  The  current  situation  of  
working  from  home  and  different  ways  that  we  are 
working  to  meet  the  library  community  needs  may 
impact  our  ability  to  be  able  to  implement  all  of  the 
changes  that  we  want  to  make  prior  to  July  1,  but  
that is our current plan and goal.

We have created four divisions across the agency:

•	 The Administration Services Division includes the 

Administration and Public Information  
Departments.

•	 The Technology Services Division includes the IT  

and Digital Initiatives Departments.

•	 The Patron Services Division includes the  

Circulation/Reference, ILL, and Talking Books 
Departments.

nder  the  Administration  Services  Division,  the  
Public  Information  Department  includes:  Al  Peterson  
as  our  Outreach  Specialist;  he  will  be  focusing 
on  outreach  to  state  agencies,  webinars,  e-rate, 
and  outreach  activities.  Kristen  Northrup 
is  our 
Data  Analyst;  she  will  be  doing  in-depth  statistical  
analysis  on  state  library  services  and  programs,  as 
well  as  other  data-related  activities.  In  the  Public 

  U

•	 The Library Services Division includes the Library 

Development and Cataloging Departments.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

Every  month,  I  have  a  reminder  that  pops  up  on 
my  calendar  that  my  Flickertale  article  is  due.  It’s 
set  for  a  few  days  before  the  actual  due  date.  I  
have  always  been  horrible  with  due  dates.  Ask  
the  library  director  of  my  local  public  library  or  
State  Library  staff.  I  usually  receive  a  reminder 
email  from  BreAnne  several  days  after  the  due  
date  asking  for  my  article.  The  only  saving  grace 
is  that  she  knows  that  the  article  will  be  coming 
and  can  save  space  for  it  as  she  is  planning  out  
the  rest  of  the  newsletter.  There  are  any  number 
of  reasons  why  my  article  is  often,  not  always  but  
often,  overdue. This  month,  it  is  because  my  brain 
is  so  full  of  so  many  different  things  that  I  can’t 
even  focus  on  one  topic.  I  know  that  many  of  us 
are  tired  of  hearing  about,  thinking  about,  and 
dealing  with  COVID-19  or  the  Coronavirus.  I  am  
too.  It  is  the  reason  that  my  head  feels  ready  to 
explode  with  an  overabundance  of  information.  
The  sheer  volume  of  email  over  the  past  few  
weeks has been overwhelming. 

At  the  State  Library,  we  are  working  hard  to  
assess  and  meet  the  needs  of  the  North  Dakota 
library  community  during  this  unprecedented  
time.  We  are  hosting  biweekly  meetings  for  the 
library  community  to  come  together  to  discuss 
just  
concerns,  questions,  best  practices  or  to 
interact  with  another  human  being  who  doesn’t 
share  your  dwelling  place  with  you.  We  have 
answered  questions  about  the  continuation  of 
service, grant extensions, pandemic policies, online 
library  resources  and  a  myriad  of  other  topics. We 
are  grateful  that  the  library  community  is  trusting 
us  to  help  guide,  assess,  and  give  advice  as  we  
are  struggling  with  the  current  normal.  We  feel  
very  blessed  to  be  part  of  the  amazing  library 
community  in  North  Dakota  and  truly  honored  to 
be figuring this all out beside you.

While  this  time  has  definitely  brought  some 
struggles  with  it,  I  believe  there  are  also  silver  
linings  too.  I  am  very  much  a  rose-colored-glasses 
and  silver-linings  kind  of  girl.  I  think  that  we  are 
learning  to  rely  on  each  other  in  new  ways.  We  
are  working  together  in  different  ways;  North  
Dakota  is  the  only  state,  as  far  as  I  know,  that 
issued a joint statement between the State Library 
Association  and  the  State  Library;  I  am  grateful 
to  live  in  a  state  that  encourages  partnerships 
and  working  together.  One  of  Governor  Burgum’s  
cultural  aspirations 
is  one  team  or  TeamND;  
although  we  are  many  state  agencies,  we  are  one 
team.  I  feel  that  is  really  true  for  North  Dakota 
libraries  as  well.  Many  libraries,  one  team  and  that 
has been made clear during this pandemic. 

Personally,  I  have  connected  with  people  at  a  
deeper  level  and  reached  out  to  people  that  I  
haven’t  connected  to  in  a  while.  I  am  grateful  to  
be  living  in  a  time  where  technology  can  lessen  
the  isolation  and  other  impacts  of  the  pandemic.  
As 
librarians,  we  can  use  that  technology  to  
serve  our  patrons  even  when  we  can’t  serve  
them  in  person.  I  sure  do  miss  having  public  in  
our  building  and  look  forward  to  returning  to 
normal, whatever our new normal may be.

I  encourage  you  to  find  ways  to  connect  with  
other  people,  within  and  outside  of  the  library 
community.  Give  yourself  grace  during  these 
stressful  times.  Make  sure  that  you  are  taking  the 
time  for  self-care  as  well  as  care  for  those  around 
you.  In  many  of  his  press  conferences,  Governor 
Burgum  suggests  sending  a  note  of  gratitude  to 
someone  that  has  impacted  you.  I  would  like  to  
send  a  note  of  gratitude  to  each  of  you,  for  
allowing  us  to  serve  you,  for  your  support  and 
friendship  and  for  all  the  amazing  ways  that  you 
each serve the citizens of North Dakota.

NDLCC Corner

We have received a few questions relating to the Library Vision grants and wanted to share the answers  
in case others have the same questions. 

If  you  received  a  Collection  Development  Grant  and  want  to  continue  purchasing  materials,  you  may  
still  submit  reimbursement  requests  in  the  same  manner  as  usual.  Grant  reports  may  be  submitted  as  
an email attachment to ndsladmn@nd.gov. 

If  you  need  to  request  an  extension  to  your  grant  project,  please  send  the  request  to  State  Librarian  
Mary  Soucie  at  msoucie@nd.gov.  Each  request  will  be  considered  individually.  Some  requests  can  be 
determined  by  the  State  Librarian,  while  others  will  have  to  be  brought  to  the  North  Dakota  Library 
Coordinating  Council  for  consideration.  The  scope  of  the  request  will  determine  if  the  State  Librarian  
will approve it or send it on to the Coordinating Council for a decision.

he  Council  will  next  meet  on  April  24  via  Zoom.  Contact  the  State  Library  at  ndsladmn@nd.gov  for  
login  information  if  you’d  like  to  join  the  meeting.  The  Council  will  be  adopting  the  final  version  of  
the Library Vision document and discussing future grant opportunities.

Program Spotlight: COVID-19

Programming  amidst  the  current  pandemic  is  starting  to  look  vastly  different;  from  virtual  
storytimes  and  book  clubs  to  curb-side  book  pick-up,  librarians  are  scrambling  to  find  ways  to  
serve  their  communities.  Here  are  a  few  ways  to  keep  library  service  going  while  your  library  is  
closed to the public:

1.  Provide  Ask-A-Librarian  service  where  patrons  can  call  or  email  in  their  reference  questions.  

Just because your doors are closed doesn’t mean that people’s questions have stopped.

2.  Make  sure  there  is  access  to  accurate  information  regarding  COVID-19  efforts  and  support  

in your area, the Census, and other news-worthy topics that are making the rounds online.

3.  Advertise  your  online  resources  such  as  databases  and  ebooks  and  audiobooks  by  doing  

short book talks.

4. 

In  honor  of  National  Poetry  Month,  consider  having  your  patrons  send  in  their  Black  Out  
Poetry or Book Spine Poetry to be featured on your Facebook, Instagram, or website. 

5.  Modify  your  planned  programs  into  passive  or  virtual  programming.  Here  are  a  few  of  
my  favorites:  The  Price  is  Right,  code,  or  play  a  collaborative  game,  role-player  games  like  
Dungeons and Dragons, or any board game at all.

This  list  is  by  no  means  all-inclusive,  but  hopefully,  it  gets  you  thinking  about  ways  to  keep  your  
programs running during this time.

Did You Know...

...that  362,696  documents  were  accessed  from  Ancestry  Library  Edition  in  2019?  Through  April  30th, 
Ancestry  is  accessible  outside  of  your  library  walls  and  in  your  home.  Use  this  link  for  free  access  to

Introduction To The New Public Access Catalog: Searching

In	last	month’s	issue	of	the	Flickertale,	we	covered	the	features	of	the	new	Public	Access	Catalog	(PAC).	 
This month, we’ll discuss the Searching features of the new PAC.

The  default  search  for  a  system-wide  search  is  Keyword.  Some  libraries,  such  as  the  North  
Dakota  State  Library,  have  customized  their  search  screens  with  additional  options  such  as  
Series, Fiction, and Nonfiction.

The following is a brief description for the different types of searches you can use in the PAC:

Keyword-  a  keyword  search  in  any  field  looks  in  all  the  search  fields  of  
the library catalog to find your keyword text. 

Browse-  when  you  browse  the  library  catalog,  you  can  type  just  the  first  
few  letters  or  numbers  of  your  search  term—an  author’s  name,  a  subject, 
a series name, a title, or a call number. The results list shows the portion of  
the catalog index that begins with the text you have typed.

Phrase-  a  phrase  search  looks  for  matches  to  multiple  words,  in  the  
same  order  you  typed  them.  You  might  choose  a  phrase  search  when  
you  know  the  phrase  is  part  of  a  specific  title,  not  necessarily  at  the  
beginning of the title. 

Exact-  an  exact  search  looks  for  your  exact  text,  from  beginning  to  end, 
whether  your  search  text  is  multiple  words  or  just  one  word.  An  exact  
search  is  useful  when  you  know  the  text  precisely;  for  example,  when 
searching for titles such as It	(Stephen	King).

Advanced-  with  advanced  searching,  you  can  do  a  complex,  focused 
keyword  search,  combining  several  search  terms  and  selecting  a  search  
field  for  each  one. You  do  not  need  to  know  any  special  commands  to  do 
advanced searching, Boolean is built into the search.

Boolean-	 with	 a	 Boolean	 search,	 you	 can	 do	 complex,	 precise	 searches	 by	 typing	 CQL	 (Common	 
Query	 Language)	 search	 commands.	 	 These	 types	 of	 searches	 are	 more	 complex	 and	 require	 a	 
knowledge of command driven searching and Boolean operators.

My  Lists-  this  will  give  you  access  to  any  lists  you  have  created. You  must  be  signed  in  to  view  or  add  
to a list.

If you would like more information, you can find it in the Help features.

Downloadable Self-Help Audiobooks

Many  people  are  using  their  new  time  restricted  to  home  to  start  self-improvement  projects.  Many  
people  suddenly  working  from  home  are  pursuing  professional  development  opportunities,  especially 
when  many  of  their  regular  tasks  do  not  transfer.  Self-help  is  practically  the  original  audiobook.  People  
were  buying  “self-help  tapes”  long  before  it  became  common  to  listen  to  the  latest  bestseller.  And  
through  the  RBdigital  platform,  over  400  titles  are  available  to  patrons  for  download,  almost  all  of  
them  with  unlimited  simultaneous  usage.  RBdigital  is  part  of  Recorded  Books,  one  of  the  largest  
publishers of books on tape and then on CD, who thus has a decades-long backlist on the topic.

he  easiest  way  to  reach  the  offerings  is  by  a  genre  search.  Self-help  is  one  of  those  choices.  Due  to  
errors  in  the  data  files  sent  by  publishers,  which  RBdigital  can’t  edit,  you  will  see  the  occasional  book  
on the list that clearly doesn’t belong, but 99% do.

elf-help  covers  a  wide  range  of  topics,  of  course.  There  are  titles  on  wealth  building,  relationships,  
addiction,  self-esteem,  leadership,  business  success,  and  assorted  celebrity  advice.  There  are  recent 
bestsellers	(this	group	sometimes	has	a	holds	list)	and	classics.

Course Of The Month: Internet Safety

in  Niche  Academy.  Many  businesses, 

This  month,  we  are  looking  at  an  Internet  Safety  course  
including  
found 
North  Dakota  State  Government  agencies,  require  a  
refresher  on  internet  safety  through  their  learning  portals. 
This  course  is  designed  not  only  as  a  quick  introduction 
to  internet  safety  but  also  as  a  quick  stop  if  clarification  is  
needed  on  just  one  subject.  This  course  is  not  intended  to  replace  the  annual  training  that  may  
be required for your job but rather to give you the highlights of the importance of internet safety. 

If you have any questions, please e-mail us a	ndsltrain@nd.gov.

TumbleBooks

Now  is  the  time  that  e-books  are  needed  the  most.  Getting  access  to  a  variety  of  books  provides  
an  escape  from  what  is  happening  in  the  real  world.  With  this  in  mind,  the  North  Dakota  State  
Library  has  gained  access  to  several  sections  of TumbleBooks. TumbleBooks  is  an  online  book  resource  
that provides the full e-book or audiobook directly in the browser.

he State Library has access to the following sections:

TumbleBook Library, which is for K-6th grade students

TeenBook Cloud, which is for 7-12th grade students

Audiobook Cloud, which has audiobooks for all ages

Romance Book Cloud, which is geared toward adults

ach of these options has books available that have no check out period and do not require download. 

ithin  each  of  these  options,  the  user  can  search  by  book  title,  genre,  or  general  type  of  book.  For 
example,  in  Teen  Book  Cloud,  there  is  a  section  called  AP  English  that  offers  many  of  the  popular  
books  chosen  in  AP  English  classes  around  the  country.  Both  the  TumbleBook  Library  and  Teen  
Book  Cloud  offer  Graphic  Novels  for  those  students  who  are  reluctant  readers.  There  is  something  
for every type of student in these databases.

he  State  Library  will  be  providing  access  to  these  databases  until  August  31,  2020.  Login  information  
can be found on the State Library’s database page. 

If you have any questions, please e-mail ndsltrain@nd.gov.

APRIL 2020

By Jessica Robinson

I  don’t  know  that  there’s  ever  been  a  better  time  
in  my  life  to  sink  into  a  thick  book.  Now,  saying  
that  all  fantasy  novels  are  doorstoppers 
is  a 
stereotype  but  it  is  true  that  the  genre  is  built  
on  trying  to  create  a  new  world  for  readers.  This 
month,  we’re  going  to  look  at  some  of  2020’s 
fantastical  attempts  to  pull  us  into  new  worlds, 
even if it’s just for a short time.

Brian  D.  Anderson 
is  undoubtedly  a  familiar  
name  to  people  who  have  spent  some  time  in  
the  SFF  section  of  a  bookstore.  This  year,  he  
brings  us  the  beginning  of  a  new  series,  starting 
with  The	 Bard’s	 Blade,  the  story  of  a  winemaker 
and  her  musician  fiancé  as  they  leave  the  safety  
of  their  magically  secure  country  for  the  dangers  
of 
the  outside  world,  filled  with  assassins,  
sorcerers,  and,  of  course,  an  ancient  evil  bent  
on destroying everything.

If  you’re  like  me,  you  recognize  Eoin  Colfer  as  
the  author  of  Artemis	 Fowl,  a  fantastic  middle 
grade  series  about  a  tween  criminal  mastermind. 
In Highfire, Colfer brings the same madcap energy 
to an adult novel as he did to Artemis	Fowl, starting 
with  a  Netflix-binging  dragon  and  a  teenage  boy  
on the run from a deadly smuggler.

in		
Sunder	 City.  Here,  a  soldier-turned-detective  
named  Fetch  aids  magical  creatures  in  a  city  
that’s  recently  lost  its  magic.  Despite  the  fact  
that  Fetch  is  human,  he  will  only  help  these 
desperate  fantasy  people  and,  when  a  prominent 
vampire citizen goes missing, this group will need 
all the help it can get. 

a  government  agency  charged  with  running

obviously, Baker’s entire life turns upside-down.

infinite  house.  The  corridors  are  endless,  the  
unique  statues  are  too  numerous  to  count,  the 
rooms  could  individually  house  everyone  who’s 
ever  lived,  and  an  ocean  is  trapped  in  one  series  
of  hallways,  always  increasing.  Piranesi  isn’t  afraid  
of  his  strange  house  though;  he  lives  to  explore  
it, all at the direction of a researcher who pursues  
a great secret hidden within. 

The	 Invisible	 Life	 of	 Addie	 LaRue  by  V.E.  Schwab 
looks  at  the  toll  an  isolated  life  can  take,  through 
a magical lens. Addie LaRue made a Faustian pact  
in  the  1700s  and  was  given  an  eternal  life— 
where  no  one  she  ever  meets  will  remember  
her.  Centuries  later,  Addie  has  exhausted  all  of  
her  attempts  to  leave  a  permanent  mark  on  
the  world  and  then  has  a  chance  meeting  with  
a man in a bookstore who knows her name.

The	 House	 in	 the	 Cerulean	 Sea  by  T.J.  Klune  has  
a  fantastic  premise.  Linus  Baker  is  a  timid  man  
who  just  so  happens  to  be  a  caseworker  for 
in  Charge  Of  Magical  Youth, 
the  Department 

Next  month,  we’ll  keep  going  on  this  discovery  
of  new  worlds  with  fantasy’s  twin  and  take  a  
peek  at  some  of  2020’s  upcoming  science  
fiction books.

Secondary School Librarians And Classroom Teachers

Liz  Deskins,  author  of  Content-Area	 Collaborations	 for	 Secondary		
Grades, takes you through each of the six Shared Foundations—Inquire, 
Include,  Collaborate,  Curate,  Explore,  and  Engage  in  twenty  individual 
units.  Similar  to  Lessons	 Inspired	 by	 Picture	 Books	 for	 Primary	 Grades,  by 
Maureen Schlosser and Rebecca Granatini, Deskins explores the middle 
and  secondary  school  climate  as  she  collects  collaborative  lessons  
from librarians working with teachers in a variety of subject areas.

Organized  by  a  common  unit  template,  these  librarians  demonstrate  how  the  Domains—Think,  
Create,  Share,  and  Grow  are  used  to  develop  the  four  lessons  within  each  unit.  Each  unit  begins  
with  an  overview,  essential  questions,  and  pre-assessment.  Each  lesson  begins  with  an  objective,  
followed  by  a  new  AASL  standard  and  an  appropriate  content-area  national  standard. The  duration 
of  time  is  listed  in  each  lesson,  as  well  as  materials.  All  necessary  reproducibles,  which  serve  as  
assessments, are included at the end of the unit. A post-assessment is also offered. 

The  following  list  delineates  the  various  content-areas  featured  in  the  different  lessons:  social  
studies,  English  language  arts,  technology,  arts,  music,  health,  psychology,  science,  and  languages.  
The  book  concludes  with  suggestions  for  personalizing  the  content-area  collaborations  and  an  
appendix  of  additional  resources. The  North  Dakota  State  Library  has  this  resource  available  for  you  
to check out.

needs  of  individuals  and  the  community.  Nearly  80  public  libraries  in  the  U.S.  have  collaborated  with  
social  work  programs  or  schools  of  social  work,  to  provide  valuable  learning  opportunities  for  social  
work  interns,  and  to  connect  community  members  with  crucial  services  which  exist  beyond  standard

Legal Research Resources for Answering a Small Claims Court Case

   

  

 

 

 

Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

Answering  a  claim  affidavit  filed  in  North  Dakota 
Small  Claims  Court  is  a  frequently  requested  
legal  research  topic  by  self-represented  patrons  
of  the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library 
and North Dakota Legal Self Help Center.

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources  
in  North  Dakota  for  answering  a  claim  affidavit  
filed in North Dakota Small Claims Court.

What is Small Claims Court?

Small  Claims  Court  is  the  informal  way  to  bring  
a civil lawsuit in North Dakota. Small Claims Court 
is  designed  to  be  used  by  people  or  businesses  
to  bring  claims  without  hiring  an  attorney.  The  
claim  must  be  one  of  the  two  types  of  claims 
allowed  in  Small  Claims  Court,  and  the  situation 
must  fit  into  one  of  the  six  options  where  the  
claim can be filed in North Dakota.

Two  types  of  claims  can  be  brought  to  Small 
Claims Court. The first type of claim is to recover 
money  totaling  $15,000.00  or  less.  The  second 
type of claim is to cancel an agreement based on 
material  fraud,  deception,  misrepresentation,  or 
false  promise.  The  value  of  the  agreement  must  
be $15,000.00 or less.

A person can bring their claim to Small Claims 
Court  only  if  their  situation  fits  into  one  of  the  
six  options  for  where  to  file  a  claim  in  North  
Dakota. Form 1, Page 2 of the Small Claims Court 
forms lists the six options.

North  Dakota  Small  Claims  Court  judgments  are 
final and can’t be appealed.

Parties in Small Claims Court

Plaintiff:  the  person  bringing  the  Small  Claims 
Court  case  by  filing  and  serving  a  Small  Claims 
Court  Claim  Affidavit.  There  may  be  more  than  
one Plaintiff.

Defendant:  the  person  the  Plaintiff  is  suing  in 
Small  Claims  Court. There  may  be  more  than  one 
Defendant.  Only  the  Defendant  can  request  an  
in person hearing in Small Claims Court. 

Answering  A  Claim  Affidavit  Filed  in  North 
Dakota Small Claims Court

Step  One:  the  Plaintiff  files  their  Small  Claims 
Court  Claim  Affidavit  with  the  clerk  of  court.  
In  Small  Claims  Court,  the  Plaintiff  is  required  to  
file  their  Claim  Affidavit  before  serving  a  copy  
on the Defendant. 

If  the  clerk  of  court  accepts  the  Plaintiff’s  Claim 
Affidavit  for  filing,  a  case  number  is  assigned  
and added to the top of the Claim Affidavit.

Step  Two:  the  Plaintiff  arranges  to  have  the 
Defendant served with the Claim Affidavit. 

Plaintiff  must  arrange  to  have  the  Defendant  
served  a  copy  of  the  Claim  Affidavit  in  one  of  
three ways:

1.  A  sheriff  of  the  county  where  the  Defendant  
located  serves  the  documents  to  the 

is 
Defendant;

2.  An  individual  18  years  of  age  or  older  and  
not  a  party  or  interested  in  the  Small  Claims 
Court  case  serves  the  documents  to  the 
Defendant; or

3.  An 

individual  18  years  of  age  or  older  
mails  the  documents  to  the  Defendant  by 
Restricted  Delivery  with  Return  Receipt 
Requested.

The  Plaintiff  must  file  proof  of  service  with 
the  clerk  of  court.  If  the  Plaintiff  is  unable  to  
serve  the  Defendant,  or  is  unable  to  file  proof  
of service, the case ends.

Continued	on	pg.	13

 

 

  

   

FLICKERTALE 
Continued	from	pg.	12
Step  Three:  the  Defendant  calculates  their  20  
day  deadline  and  either  continues  in  Small 
Claims  Court  or  moves  to  North  Dakota  State 
District Court. 

13 

Once  the  Defendant  is  served  a  copy  of  the  
Claim  Affidavit,  the  Defendant  has  20  days  from  
the  day  after  they  were  served  to  do  one  of  
two things:

1.  Make  a  written  request  for  an 
hearing in Small Claims Court; or 

in-person  

2.  Make  a  written  request  to  move  the  case 
to  North  Dakota  State  District  Court  for  
the	 formal	 civil	 court	 process.	 (This	 is	 also	 
called	“removal.”)

If  the  Defendant  requests  an  in-person  hearing  
in  Small  Claims  Court,  the  hearing  is  held  within 
10  to  30  days  after  the  Defendant’s  written  
request  is  received  by  the  clerk  of  court.  If  the 
Defendant  requests  a  hearing  in  Small  Claims 
Court,  the  Defendant  also  has  the  option  of  
filing  one  or  both  of  the  following  before  the  
date of the hearing:

•	 A  written  answer  to  the  Plaintiff’s  Claim  

Affidavit.

•	 A  counterclaim  against  the  Plaintiff,  as  long  

as the counterclaim is $15,000.00 or less.

If  the  Defendant  moves  the  case  to  North  
Dakota  State  District  Court,  the  Small  Claims  
Court  case  is  dismissed.  The  case  continues  in  
North  Dakota  State  District  Court  as  a  formal  
civil  action.  If  the  Defendant  moves  the  case  to  
District  Court  and  loses,  the  Defendant  must  pay 
the	 Plaintiff’s	 attorneys	 fees.	 (See	 the	 Guide  to  a  
Civil  Action  for  the  basic  steps  and  procedures  
that  take  place  after  a  Defendant  moves  the  
case	to	District	Court.)

Step  Four: 
if  the  Defendant  requests  an  
in-person  hearing  in  Small  Claims  Court,  both 
the  Plaintiff  and  Defendant  must  attend  the 
hearing to tell their side. 

The  hearing  is  informal.  There  is  no  jury  or  court 
reporter.  The  judge  or  judicial  referee  can  ask 
questions,  and  the  Plaintiff  and  Defendant  can  
ask questions, too.

APRIL 2020

Small  Claims  Court  hearings  are  generally  set  for 
30  minutes  total,  which  means  the  Plaintiff  and 
Defendant  may  have  only  10-15  minutes  to  tell 
their  side.  It’s  a  good  idea  to  prepare  in  advance  
for the hearing.

Step  Five:  the  Small  Claims  Court  judge  or 
judicial  referee  decides  the  case.  If  the  case  is 
decided  at  the  end  of  the  hearing,  a  copy  of  the 
judgment  may  be  given  at  that  time.  If  the  case 
is decided later, or if a copy of the judgment isn’t 
provided at the end of the hearing, the judgment 
will be mailed.

North  Dakota  Small  Claims  Court  judgments  are 
final and can’t be appealed.

Small  Claims  Court  judgments  can  be  collected 
using  any  of  the  judgment  collection  options 
available under North Dakota law.

Default Judgment

When  a  Defendant  doesn’t  request  a  Small  
Claims  Court  hearing  or  to  move  the  case  to  
District  Court,  the  Small  Claims  Court  judge  or 
judicial  referee  may  award  a  default  judgment 
against  the  Defendant.  The  Plaintiff  must  prove  
in  the  documents  they  filed  that  the  Defendant

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
