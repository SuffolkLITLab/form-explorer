This Informational Guide to restoring the right to possess firearms in North Dakota is 
made up of two sections: 

The first section gives general information about restoring the right to possess 
firearms. (Pages 2 - 9)

SECTION ONE: 

INFORMATION ABOUT RESTORING THE RIGHT TO POSSESS FIREARMS 
IN NORTH DAKOTA 

WHAT IS RESTORING THE RIGHT TO POSSESS FIREARMS? 

North Dakota law prevents a person convicted of a felony, convicted of certain types of 
misdemeanors, or found mentally deficient from possessing firearms. 

However, North Dakota law allows for the restoration of the right to possess firearms when a 
North Dakota state district court revoked the individual’s right to purchase, possess or have 
control of a firearm. 

CAN I ASK A NORTH DAKOTA STATE COURT TO RESTORE THE RIGHT TO POSSESS 
FIREARMS IF I HAVE AN OUT-OF-STATE OR FEDERAL COURT CONVICTION? 

NO!  If you are prohibited from possessing a firearm due to an out-of-state or federal criminal 

conviction,  STOP!   You CANNOT petition a North Dakota state district court to restore the 

right to possess firearms using North Dakota state law. 

If you are prohibited from purchasing, possessing or having control of a firearm due to an 

out-of-state or federal court finding of mental deficiency or disability,  STOP!   You CANNOT 

petition a North Dakota state district court to restore the right to purchase, possess or have 
control of firearms using North Dakota state law. 

You may wish to consult an attorney who can advise you on federal laws or the other state’s 
laws about restoration of the right to possess firearms.

WHO CANNOT POSSESS FIREARMS IN NORTH DAKOTA? 

A person who has been convicted anywhere of a felony offense involving violence or 
intimidation. 

•  The person cannot possess or have control of a firearm for a period of ten years after 
the date of conviction or the date of release from incarceration, parole, or probation, 
whichever is latest. 

A person who has been convicted anywhere of a felony offense or a Class A misdemeanor 
offense involving violence or intimidation and the use of a dangerous weapon. 

•  The person cannot own, possess or have control of a firearm for a period of five years 
after the date of conviction or the date of release from incarceration, parole, or 
probation, whichever is latest. 

•  The individual who was convicted of the offense in North Dakota state court may 

petition the North Dakota state district court for restoration of the individual’s firearm 
rights. 

A person who is or has ever been diagnosed and confined or committed to a hospital or other 
institution due to mental deficiency. 

•  The person cannot purchase, possess or have control of a firearm, unless the person has 

not suffered from the disability for the previous three years. 

• 

If a North Dakota state district court revoked the individual’s right to purchase, possess 
or have control of a firearm, that individual may petition a North Dakota state district 
court for restoration of the individual’s firearm rights. 

If you are unsure whether your firearm rights have been revoked it may be helpful to look at 
your previous criminal judgments that would state your loss of rights. You may also wish to 
consult a lawyer who can advise you of your rights and responsibilities.

case law and followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rules and rulings, and case law (court decisions).  Notes of case law (court 
decisions) related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are found in many North 
Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

At the hearing, you, the Petitioner, must prove the information you provided in your petition.  
Each Respondent may present evidence to disprove the information you provided in your 
petition. 

Caution! Preparing for a hearing is often a complex and confusing process.  You are held to the 
same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or 
procedures.  You will need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

At minimum, review and research the laws and rules listed throughout this Informational 
Guide.  You will use the North Dakota Rules of Evidence, in particular, to present your evidence 
and object to each Respondent’s evidence. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers.  Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

If Your Petition is Dismissed: 

Review the order dismissing your petition. 

If your petition is dismissed with prejudice, you cannot re-file the petition. 

If your petition is dismissed without prejudice, you may re-file the petition at a later date.

The above matter came before the Court upon the Petition of John Doe, the Defendant 

in case number XX-20XX-CR-000XX.  The Petitioner represented himself, and the State of North 

Dakota was represented by Jane Smith, Assistant State’s Attorney for XXXXXXXX County.  This 

Court, having considered the submissions of the Petitioner and the State of North Dakota and 

all manner of records, hereby finds by clear and convincing evidence: 

2. 

Jurisdiction is proper in XXXXXX County, North Dakota.  Petitioner resides in 

XXXXXXXXXXX, North Dakota.  Petitioner’s criminal conviction arose out of XXXXXXXX County 

District Court in the State of North Dakota. 

3. 

On or about January 5, 20XX in XXXXXXXX County, North Dakota, the Petitioner pled 

guilty to felony burglary, a Class C Felony.  The Petitioner’s conviction resulted in a prohibition 

from using, possessing, or owning firearms, dangerous weapons, or destructive devices. 

4. 

The Petitioner has paid all fines imposed for the violation resulting in the prohibition.

The Petitioner’s record and reputation are such that the individual is not likely to act in a 

manner dangerous to the safety of others. 

8. 

According to Section 62.1-02-01.1 of the North Dakota Century Code, a person who has 

been dispossessed of the right to possess firearms as a result of a felony conviction may 

petition the Court for an Order restoring the right to own and possess firearms.  Upon clear and 

convincing proof of successful completion of probation, and similar proof that a Petitioner is 

not likely to act in a manner dangerous to others, the Court may restore the right to possess 

firearms for a person whose right was revoked as a result of a felony conviction. 

9. 

Based upon the foregoing, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: 

10. 

The Petitioner’s right to own and possess firearms is hereby RESTORED, subject to 

whatever federal restrictions may remain in place since this order addresses North Dakota state 

firearm laws and not federal firearm laws. 

11. 

The Petitioner is cautioned that this Order affects his right to possess a firearm solely 

within the State of North Dakota.  The Petitioner is instructed to make proper legal inquiry 

before attempting to purchase or possess a firearm in another state, as the law of the State 

may preclude Petitioner’s firearm possession irrespective of this Order.
