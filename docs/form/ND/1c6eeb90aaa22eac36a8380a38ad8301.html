      <pre>Instructions for Requesting a Domestic Violence Protection Order  

Important! Read Before Using This Packet of Forms. 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). If 
you’re unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

You may ask for assistance from a Certified Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Advocate for 
help filling out the forms.  Information about Certified Domestic Violence Sexual Assault 
Advocates is on pages 4 and 5 of these instructions. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about 
finding a lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as 
a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
procedure for petitioning a North Dakota state district court for a Domestic Violence 
Protection Order (DVPO). There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms 
available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the forms or information provided. 

Use at your own risk. 

Chapter 14-07.1 of the North Dakota Century Code governs Domestic Violence Protection 
Orders in North Dakota. 

Rule 34 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules and Orders governs Certified 
Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Advocates.

Who May Use this Packet? 

•  A spouse or former spouse; 
•  A family member; 
•  A parent; 
•  A child; 
•  A person related by blood or marriage; 
•  A person currently living with the abusing person or who has lived with that person in 

the past; 

•  A person who has a child in common with the abusing person; 
•  Persons who are in a dating relationship; or 
•  Any other person with sufficient relationship to the abusing person as determined by 

the Judge or Judicial Referee. 

What if the Domestic Violence Happened in North Dakota But the 
Respondent Isn’t in North Dakota? 

(The Petitioner is the person requesting a Domestic Violence Protection Order and may be any 
of the persons listed above. The Respondent is the person the Petitioner alleges in their 
petition to be engaged in domestic violence.) 

Before a North Dakota state district court can grant a Domestic Violence Protection Order, the 
court must have personal jurisdiction over the Petitioner and the Respondent. Personal 
jurisdiction gives the court the power to inquire into the facts, apply the law, and determine 
and pronounce judgment. 

Determining whether a Respondent meets the requirements for personal jurisdiction requires 
legal advice. Neither ND Legal Self Help Center staff nor Court System staff can give you legal 
advice. You need to make this determination yourself or consult a lawyer for legal advice. 

Start your legal research into personal jurisdiction with Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 

Rule 4 includes the definition of a “person” and the requirements for exercising personal 
jurisdiction over a person.

What if the Domestic Violence Didn’t Happen in North Dakota? 

The Petitioner may file a petition for a Domestic Violence Protection Order if the domestic 
violence didn’t happen in North Dakota, as long as the Petitioner lives in North Dakota. If the 
Respondent isn’t in North Dakota, the North Dakota State District Court has personal 
jurisdiction over the Respondent when the Respondent enters North Dakota.  

The Domestic Violence Protection Order must be limited to restraining the Respondent from 
contacting or committing domestic violence on the protected persons in North Dakota. 

(See Section 14-07.1-02(9) of the North Dakota Century Code.) 

Overview of the Domestic Violence Protection Order Process 

Step 1: Petition Filed. The Petitioner completes and files a petition with the North Dakota State 
District Court requesting a domestic violence protection order. 

Step 2: Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order Issued. The Judge or Judicial Referee 
may issue a temporary domestic violence protection order if the Judge or Judicial Referee finds 
that the petition claims an immediate and present danger of domestic violence, based on a 
claim of a recent incident of actual domestic violence. 

Step 3: Hearing Scheduled; Notice of Hearing Served. A hearing is scheduled on the petition for 
a domestic violence protection order not later than fourteen (14) days after the Judge or 
Judicial Referee issues the temporary domestic violence protection order. 

The Petitioner arranges for the Sheriff to serve the Respondent with the notice of the hearing 
and a copy of the petition. 

Step 4: Hearing Held. The hearing is held to determine if the Judge or Judicial Referee will 
extend the temporary order and grant a domestic violence protection order. At the hearing, the 
Petitioner must show evidence of actual or imminent domestic violence. 

Step 5: Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant Domestic Violence Protection 
Order. After the hearing, if the Judge or Judicial Referee finds the Petitioner proved there is 
evidence of actual or imminent domestic violence, a domestic violence protection order may be 
granted against the Respondent. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that the Petitioner didn’t show evidence of actual or 
imminent domestic violence prove at the hearing, the case is dismissed.

If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds the Petition for Protective Relief alleges an immediate 
and present danger of abuse based upon a recent incident of actual or threatened domestic 
violence, the Judge or Judicial Referee will sign an Ex Parte Temporary Domestic Violence 
Protection Order.  

NDLSHC 

Page 10 of 13 

DVPO Instructions/Rev. Nov 2022 

The Ex Parte Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order may include the following 
emergency relief: 

•  Restraining any party from having contact with or committing acts of domestic violence 

on another person. 

•  Excluding the Respondent or any person with whom the Respondent lives from the 

dwelling they share, from the residence of another person, or from a domestic violence 
shelter care facility. 

•  Awarding temporary custody or establishing temporary visitation rights with regard to 

minor children. 

•  Requiring the Respondent to surrender to local law enforcement any firearms or 

dangerous weapons under the Respondent’s control. 

The Temporary Order doesn’t provide for support, counseling, or attorney fees. 

Step 3 – The Hearing is Scheduled; Petitioner Arranges for the Sheriff 
to Serve the Temporary Order & Notice of Hearing on the 
Respondent. 

The District Court will schedule a time and date for the hearing on your Petition. The hearing 
will be scheduled within 14 days of the approval of the Ex Parte Temporary Domestic Violence 
Protection Order. 

Service must be made on the Respondent at least five days prior to the hearing. If service can’t 
be made, the Judge or Judicial Referee may set a new hearing date. 

The Petitioner must arrange for the sheriff to serve copies of the following on the 
Respondent: 

•  The Notice of Hearing; and 
•  The Temporary Domestic Violence Protection Order. 

o  The Notice of Hearing may be combined with the Temporary Order. 

Give the Sheriff the Respondent’s full name and current location. If you don’t know, make sure 
you give the Sheriff all of the information you know about the Respondent. If the Sheriff can’t 
find the Respondent, they may not be able to complete service. The Temporary Order isn’t in 
effect until the Respondent is served. 

If the Respondent is a minor (less than 18 years old), the Respondent’s parents must also be 
served. Give the Sheriff the full names and current locations of the Respondent’s parents.  

NDLSHC 

Page 11 of 13 

DVPO Instructions/Rev. Nov 2022 

Once the Respondent is served with the Ex Parte Temporary Domestic Violence Protection 
Order, the Temporary Order is in effect and any violations should be reported to law 
enforcement. 

Step 4 – Attend the Hearing. 

You must attend at the hearing. If you’re working with a Certified Domestic Violence Sexual 
Assault Advocate, the advocate can attend the hearing with you. 

At the hearing, you must prove the facts you included in your petition. 

If you have any witnesses to the facts you included in your petition, you may bring them with 
you to the hearing.   

The hearing also gives the Respondent the opportunity to give the their side of the story and 
present their witnesses to the facts you included in your Petition. 

After the hearing, the Judge or Judicial Referee will decide if you’ve proven there’s sufficient 
evidence of actual or imminent domestic violence by the Respondent to grant a Domestic 
Violence. 

Step 5 – The Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant the 
Domestic Violence Protection Order. 

After the hearing is held, if the Judge or Judicial Referee determines you’ve proven that there’s 
sufficient evidence of actual or imminent domestic violence, the Judge or Judicial Referee will 
grant the Domestic Violence Protection Order and give the length of the Order. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee may amend the Order at any time upon a later petition filed by 
either party.   

The Domestic Violence Protection Order may include any or all of the following relief:  

•  Restraining the Respondent from threatening, molesting, injuring, or having contact of 

any kind with the Petitioner and/or the child(ren). 

•  Excluding the Respondent from the Petitioner’s and/or Protected Party’s household. 
•  Awarding temporary custody and/or visitation rights with minor child(ren), requiring 

payment of child support and/or spousal support. 

•  Recommending or requiring counseling with a domestic violence program or other 

appropriate agency. 

NDLSHC 

Page 12 of 13 

DVPO Instructions/Rev. Nov 2022 

•  Requiring the Respondent to pay reasonable attorney fees and costs. 
•  Awarding temporary use of personal property, including motor vehicles, to either party. 
•  Requiring the Respondent to surrender weapons under the Respondent’s control to 

local law enforcement if there is probable cause of future actual or threatened violence. 
•  Appointing a guardian ad litem for the benefit of the minor child or minor children.  The 
Judge or Judicial Referee may direct either or both parties to pay the guardian ad litem 
fees established by the Judge or Judicial Referee.   

The Clerk of Court sends a copy of the Domestic Violence Protection Order to the local law 
enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the residence of the victim. 

The Domestic Violence Protection Order is served on the Respondent by the Sheriff. 

Report any violations of the Order immediately to local law enforcement. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides that you didn’t prove the facts you listed in your 
petition, the case is dismissed and the Temporary Order is no longer in effect.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
