SECTION ONE: 
INFORMATION ABOUT PETITIONING A NORTH DAKOTA DISTRICT 
COURT TO REVIEW A JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA (JSND) 
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FINAL DECISION 

WHAT IS A PETITION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF A JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA 
(JSND) UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FINAL DECISION? 

If Job Service North Dakota (JSND) denied unemployment benefits, or didn’t granted the 
amount of unemployment benefits to which you believe you’re entitled under law, you may ask 
a North Dakota state district court to review the final decision. 

This process is called petitioning a North Dakota state district court to review a final decision of 
Job Service North Dakota (JSND).  This process may also be referred to as an appeal of a Job 
Service North Dakota (JSND) final decision to a North Dakota state district court. 

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA (JSND) 
HEARING AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF A JSND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FINAL 
DECISION? 

The biggest difference is that a judicial review of a Job Service North Dakota (JSND) final 
decision ISN’T a brand new trial.  Rather, the judicial review is an appeal of the JSND final 
decision.  The judicial review is based ONLY on the record created as part of the JSND 
administrative hearing. 

The District Court DOESN’T retry the case, take new evidence, or weigh the credibility of the 
witnesses which were introduced at the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) administrative 
hearing. 

At the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) administrative hearing, all of the facts and evidence 
were introduced and decided by the Administrative Law Judge.  The administrative hearing was 
the trial.  

When you, the Petitioner, ask a North Dakota state district court for judicial review of a Job 
Service North Dakota (JSND) final decision, you don’t get a brand new trial.  Instead, you argue 
that the JSND final decision, or final decisions, should be overturned.  You make your argument 
by showing that the final decision was wrongly decided based on the evidence and facts that 
were presented at the JSND Hearing.  Your argument is made in writing.

you where to file your petition.

county in which to file your petition. 

To begin your legal research to determine where to file your petition, you may wish to start 
with North Dakota Century Code Section 28-32-42.  Section 28-32-42 includes general 
requirements of where an appeal of an administrative agency final order may be filed. 

North Dakota Legal Self Help Center staff can’t tell you where to file your petition if you don’t 
live in North Dakota, as this question requires legal advice to answer.  Center staff can’t give 
legal advice for any reason under any circumstances.

If the District Court judge decides that you didn’t prove the grounds for review you listed in 
your Petition for Judicial Review, the judge must affirm the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) 
final decision. 

WHAT DOES THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING IF YOU, 
THE PETITIONER, PROVED YOUR GROUNDS (REASONS) FOR THE PETITION FOR 
JUDICIAL REVIEW? 

The District Court judge’s review of the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) final decision is based 
only on the record created during the JSND proceedings.  The judge doesn’t retry the case, take 
new evidence, or weigh the credibility of witnesses. 

When reviewing Job Service North Dakota’s (JSND’s) findings of fact, the judge decides whether 
a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined the findings were proven by the weight of 
the evidence from the entire record created during the JSND proceedings.   

The conclusions of law in the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) final decision, however, are fully 
reviewable by the judge. 

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

You, the Petitioner, aren’t required to hire a lawyer to bring a civil action in North Dakota State 
District Court.  If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and 
procedures that a lawyer is required to follow. 

If you would like to learn more about finding an attorney to represent you, go to 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer.   

When Lawyer’s Fees May be Paid by Job Service North Dakota (JSND) 

Section 27-03-07-03 of the North Dakota Administrative Code states that your lawyer fees are 
paid by the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) only if you win. Those fees are the fees that the 
lawyer would charge you for representing you in a Petition for Judicial Review. 

No lawyer fees are awarded if the lawyer is employed by or a member of, the staff of any legal 
services organization funded totally or in part by public funds.

rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You may want a lawyer to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your legal 

•  You can consult with a lawyer to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend

lawyer who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire a lawyer just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

Code. 

•  Matters placed on the record after an ex parte communication. 

Who is Responsible for Paying the Estimated Cost of Preparing the Record?  

You, the Petitioner, are required to pay the estimated costs of preparation and filing of the 
entire record of the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) proceedings.  

Job Service North Dakota (JSND) will notify you of the estimated costs after JSND is served 
copies of the Petition for Judicial Review. You pay the estimated costs directly to JSND. 

What if You Can’t Pay the Estimated Costs of Preparing the Record?  

You may ask the court to waive the estimated cost of preparing the record based on an inability 
to pay. Forms and instructions are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/admin-appeal-to-
district-court/fee-waiver.  

If you didn’t make the request when you filed your Petition for Judicial Review, you can file your 
request to waive transcript fees BEFORE you pay Job Service North Dakota’s (JSND) estimated 
costs of preparing the agency record.  

If the judge assigned to your appeal waives the transcript fees, be prepared to provide a copy of 
the order to Job Service North Dakota (JSND).

estimated costs of preparing the agency record.

If the actual cost of preparing and filing the entire record of the Job Service North Dakota 
(JSND) proceeding is more than the estimated cost, you must pay JSND the difference.  You pay 
the difference directly to JSND. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 22 of 30 

Review JSND Decision/Rev Oct 2021 

What if the Actual Cost of Preparing the Record is Lower than the Estimated Cost? 

If the actual cost of preparing and filing of the entire record of the Job Service North Dakota 
(JSND) proceeding is less than the estimated cost you paid, JSND must refund the difference to 
you.  

IMPORTANT: Job Service North Dakota (JSND) won’t began preparing, certifying, or filing the 
record UNTIL you, the Petitioner, have made payment in full of the estimated costs, or the 
costs have been waived by an order of the court. 

STEP 5: JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA (JSND) FILES THE RECORD; THE DISTRICT 
COURT JUDGE ISSUES A SCHEDULING ORDER 

Once service and filing of the documents for judicial review is complete, Job Service North 
Dakota (JSND) prepares, certifies and files the record with the district court. 

The District Court judge will issue a scheduling order with timelines for filing legal briefs and 
requesting oral argument.  

STEP 6: REQUESTING ORAL ARGUMENTS 

Carefully review the scheduling order. 

If you, the Petitioner, want to request oral arguments, the written request must be made on or 
before your deadline for filing your Petitioner brief. 

The District Court judge will decide whether to allow oral arguments.  The District Court judge 
isn’t required to permit oral arguments.

Respondent included in your legal briefs.

STEP 7: PREPARING, SERVING AND FILING YOUR PETITIONER BRIEF 

A very important requirement of the Petition for Judicial Review process is the legal brief.  Each 
party is required to file and serve a legal brief of the facts, law and argument of the judicial 
review. 

•  The legal brief is a written document filed by a party where the party represents their 

side of how facts, law, and argument of how the facts apply to the law. 

Your Petitioner brief is your chance to argue why Job Service North Dakota’s (JSND’s) final 
decision should not stand. Essentially, your Petitioner brief is a written version of what you 
would argue in front of the District Court judge, if the judge allows oral arguments. 

The Petitioner brief isn’t for new evidence and a new trial won’t be conducted. 

Your Petitioner brief must be served on Job Service North Dakota (JSND) and the other 
Respondents by the deadline in the District Court judge’s scheduling order. 

You, the Petitioner, Prepare Your Petitioner Brief: 

There are six main components to a Petitioner brief: 

Jurisdiction 

• 
Introduction 
•  Procedural History 
• 
•  Statement of Facts  
•  Law and Argument 
•  Conclusion. 

The Introduction section is a quick overview of what happened at the Job Service North Dakota 
(JSND) administrative hearing and stating why the District Court judge should grant your 
petition. The introduction isn’t a long section. It’s usually a brief paragraph so the judge knows 
what you’ll be talking about in your Petitioner brief.  

The Procedural History section is essentially the same length or shorter than the introduction 
section. You state what happened at the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) administrative 
hearing, what the final ruling of the hearing was, and why JSND ruled the way they did.  

The Jurisdiction section is a quick statement of the North Dakota statute(s) that give the North 
Dakota State District Court the authority to hear the Petition for Judicial Review. 

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 24 of 30 

Review JSND Decision/Rev Oct 2021 

Statement of Facts is a longer section.  Here, you explain the events that led to the Job Service 
North Dakota (JSND) unemployment benefits final decision, what type of evidence was 
introduced and any other relevant factual information that happened at the JSND 
administrative hearing.   

List only the specific facts connected to the grounds (reasons) you listed in your Petition for 
Judicial Review.  If possible, include the specific page or pages in the record created during the 
Job Service North Dakota (JSND) administrative hearing process where the fact can be found. 

The District Court judge can only consider information that was provided during the Job Service 
North Dakota (JSND) administrative hearing process.  You, the Petitioner, can’t include new 
facts or evidence that weren’t presented to JSND during the administrative hearing process. 

The Law and Argument Section is the most important section of the brief.  The Law and 
Argument section focuses on the legal issues and whether the law was correctly applied after 
deciding any factual disputes during the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) administrative hearing 
process.   

Refer to your Petition for Judicial Review to build the Law and Argument section.  Each ground 
(reason) for review you listed in the Petition for Judicial Review must be included in the Law 
and Argument section. 

You must research relevant statutes and case law to determine whether Job Service North 
Dakota (JSND) made legal errors that the District Court can correct.  You refer to the relevant 
statutes and case law, and then explain how the statute or case law fits with the relevant facts 
from the Statement of Facts. 

The Conclusion is a quick summary of why the District Court judge should grant your petition 
and why you should win your case.  This is usually one paragraph. 

You, the Petitioner, Make Copies of Your Completed Petitioner Brief: 

Count all of the parties involved in the Job Service North Dakota (JSND) proceedings leading up 
to the final decision.  JSND is one of the parties. 

•  These are the same parties you counted when making copies of the Petition for Judicial 
Review in Step 3.  These are also the same parties you listed as Respondents on the 
Petition for Judicial Review. 

Make a copy of your completed Petitioner brief for each Respondent.

Review JSND Decision/Rev Oct 2021 

You, the Petitioner, File the Following Completed, Original Documents with the Clerk of 
District Court: 

•  Petitioner Brief 
•  Declaration(s) of Service for each of the people listed on Page 26 

IMPORTANT: Failure to file the completed and signed Petitioner brief and Declaration(s) of 
Service with the Clerk of District Court may result in dismissal of your, the Petitioner’s, 
petition. 

STEP 8: JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA (JSND) SERVES AND FILES THEIR 
RESPONDENT BRIEF 

Job Service North Dakota (JSND) prepares their Respondent brief, which is their answer to your 
Petitioner brief.  Then, JSND serves a copy of their Respondent brief to you by the deadline in 
the scheduling order. 

Job Service North Dakota (JSND) will send their Respondent brief to your address.  JSND will 
also send a copy of their Respondent brief to each Respondent listed in your Petitioner brief 
and Petition for Judicial Review. 

Job Service North Dakota (JSND) files the original of their Respondent brief with the Clerk of 
District Court. 

STEP 9: PREPARE FOR ORAL ARGUMENTS, IF REQUESTED AND GRANTED  

If the District Court judge decides to allow oral arguments, you, the Petitioner, must be ready to 
answer questions from the judge and respond to arguments made by Job Service North Dakota 
(JSND). You must know the underlying law, case law, and be able to make a compelling 
argument tying the facts of the case and the law together to support your case. 

You’ll only be allowed to argue the issues that you listed in your Petition for Judicial Review and 
your Petitioner brief.  You’ll be allowed to counter issues and arguments brought forward in Job 
Service North Dakota’s (JSND’s) Respondent brief. 

Knowing the Underlying Law 

The underlying laws are the statutes from the North Dakota Century Code which are cited in 
your Petition for Judicial Review, your Petitioner brief and Job Service North Dakota’s (JSND) 
Respondent brief. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 28 of 30 

Review JSND Decision/Rev Oct 2021 

If you don’t know the underlying law, you’ll have a tough time tying the facts to your case. The 
judge will be looking at what the underlying law is at the beginning. 

You don’t need to know the statute word for word but must know the key parts of the statute 
in order to counter any argument being made by Job Service North Dakota (JSND). 

You can have a copy of the statute with you at the oral arguments as a reference. 

Knowing Case Law 

Case law is where a final decision of a North Dakota state district court is appealed to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court and the Supreme Court writes an opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. 

North Dakota Supreme Court case law related to petitions to review administrative final 
decisions is followed by North Dakota state district courts deciding later cases with similar facts 
and issues.  Case law may help decide the petition for the judge.   

You spent a lot of research and time finding case law when preparing and writing your 
Petitioner brief.  You should know the case law that both helps you and hurts you. 

Knowing the case law that could hurt you is important because then you’ll be prepared to 
counter any argument being made by Job Service North Dakota (JSND). 

Making a Compelling Oral Argument 

You’ll need to tie the facts to the statutes and case law to make a sound and compelling oral 
argument to the judge.  Being able to do this effectively can help decide the case in your favor.   

This is a hard task, but knowing the statutes, case law, facts of the case and the grounds for 
review are part of preparing for oral argument. 

Practice your argument before you present your oral argument to the District Court judge. 

Practicing the argument allows you to become familiar with the information.  Being familiar 
with the information will give you more confidence in your argument.  Having confidence will 
come from knowing the statute, case law, the facts of the case, and the grounds for appeal 
cited by you.

Review JSND Decision/Rev Oct 2021 

STEP 10: THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE DECIDES THE PETITION FOR JUDICIAL 
REVIEW 

The District Court judge will decide the case on the legal briefs from both you, the Petitioner, 
and Job Service North Dakota (JSND), and the oral arguments from you and JSND, if oral 
arguments were requested and granted. 

The judge may not make a decision at the close of oral arguments in front of you and Job 
Service North Dakota (JSND).  If the judge doesn’t make a decision at the close of oral 
arguments, the judge will take the legal briefs and notes the judge took at oral arguments and 
decide the case at a later date. 

Once the judge has made a decision, the judge will send a written decision to you, Job Service 
North Dakota (JSND), and each Respondent. 

If the judge doesn’t decide in your favor, you may appeal the District Court judge’s decision to 
the North Dakota Supreme Court.  If the judge doesn’t decide in favor of Job Service North 
Dakota (JSND), JSND may appeal the judge’s decision to the North Dakota Supreme Court.
