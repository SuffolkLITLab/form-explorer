      <pre>CHAPTER 32-34
WRIT OF MANDAMUS

32-34-01. By and to whom writ of mandamus issued.
The writ of mandamus may be issued by the supreme and district courts to any inferior 
tribunal,   corporation,   board,   or   person   to   compel   the   performance   of   an   act   which   the   law 
specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or to compel the admission 
of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled and from 
which the party is precluded unlawfully by such inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person.

32-34-01.1. Supreme court sua sponte may issue writ to judges of inferior courts.
The supreme court sua sponte may issue a writ of mandamus to any district court judge or 
other inferior court judge to compel such judge to act upon any judicial matters which have been 
properly placed before such judge's court. Should such judge fail to act as directed by the writ, 
such judge shall be liable for the punishment provided by this chapter.

32-34-02. When issued.
The   writ   must   be   issued   in   all   cases   when   there   is   not   a   plain,   speedy,   and   adequate 
remedy in the ordinary course of law. It must be issued upon affidavit upon the application of the 
party beneficially interested except those writs issued sua sponte by the supreme court.

32-34-03. Alternative or peremptory.
The writ may be either alternative or peremptory. The alternative writ must state generally 
the   allegation   against   the   party   to   whom   it   is   directed   and   must   command   such   party 
immediately upon the receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, to do the act required 
to be performed or to show cause before the court at a specified time and place why the party 
has not done such act. The peremptory writ must be in a similar form except that the words 
requiring the party to show cause why the party has not obeyed the command must be omitted 
and a return day inserted.

32-34-04. When each may issue.
When the application to the court is made without notice to the adverse party and the writ is 
allowed, the alternative writ must be issued first, but if the application is upon due notice and the 
writ   is   allowed,   the   peremptory   writ   may   be   issued   in   the   first   instance.   The   notice   of   the 
application, when given, must be at least ten days. The writ cannot be granted by default. The 
case must be heard by the court whether the adverse party appears or not.

32-34-05. Answer.
On the  return  of   the alternative   writ,   or  the  day  on  which  the  application  for  the  writ  is 
noticed, the party on whom the writ or notice has been served may show cause by answer 
under oath made in the same manner as an answer to a complaint in a civil action.

32-34-06. Jury may assess damages.
If   an   answer   is   made   which   raises   a   question   as   to   a   matter   of   fact   essential   to   the 
determination  of   the  motion  and  affecting  the  substantial  rights  of  the  parties   and  upon  the 
supposed truth of which allegation the application for the writ is based, the court in its discretion 
may order the question to be tried before a jury, and may postpone the argument until such trial 
can   be   had   and   the   verdict   certified   to   the   court.  The   question   to   be   tried   must   be   stated 
distinctly in the order for trial, and the county must be designated in which the same shall be 
had. The order also may direct the jury to assess any damages which the applicant may have 
sustained in case the jury finds for the applicant.

32-34-07. Latitude of proof.
On the trial the applicant is not precluded by the answer from any valid objection to its 

sufficiency and may countervail it by proof either in direct denial or by way of avoidance.

Page No. 1

32-34-08. New trial - Where motion made.
A motion for new trial must be made in the court in which the issue of fact is tried.

32-34-09. Transmission of verdict.
If no notice of a motion for a new trial is given, or, if given, the motion is denied, the clerk 
within five days after rendition of the verdict or denial of the motion must transmit to the court in 
which the application for the writ is pending a certified copy of the verdict attached to the order 
of trial after which either party may bring on the argument of the application upon reasonable 
notice to the adverse party.

32-34-10. Hearing.
If no answer is made, the case must be heard on the papers of the applicant. If the answer 
raises   only   questions   of   law   or   puts   in   issue   only   immaterial   statements   not   affecting   the 
substantial rights of the parties, the court must proceed to hear or fix a day for hearing the 
argument of the case.

32-34-11. Damages - Peremptory writ.
If judgment is given for the applicant, the applicant may recover the damages which the 
applicant has sustained as found by the jury, or as may be determined by the court, or referee 
upon a reference to be ordered, together with costs, and for such damages and costs execution 
may issue, and a peremptory mandamus also must be awarded.

32-34-12. How writ served.
The writ must be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action except when 
otherwise expressly directed by order of the court. Service upon a majority of the members of 
any board or body is service upon the board or body whether at the time of the service the 
board was in session or not.

32-34-13. Disobedience - Punishment.
When   a   peremptory   mandamus   has   been   issued   and   directed   to   any   inferior   tribunal, 
corporation,   board,   or   person,   if   it   appears   to   the   court   that   any   member   of   such   tribunal, 
corporation, board, or such person upon whom the writ has been served personally has refused 
or neglected to obey the same without just excuse, the court upon motion may impose a fine not 
exceeding one thousand dollars. In case of persistence in a refusal of obedience, the court may 
order the party to be imprisoned until the writ is obeyed and may make any orders necessary 
and proper for the complete enforcement of the writ.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
