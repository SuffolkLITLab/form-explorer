      <pre>POWERS AND DUTIES OF A GUARDIAN OF A MINOR CHILD 

Chapter 30.1-27 of the North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.) 
 
The Guardianship Standards Workgroup of the North Dakota Court System 

created this informational form for people who are nominated in a parent’s will 

to be the guardian of their minor child in the event of their death. 

Before you accept or decline your appointment in a deceased parent’s will as 

guardian of a minor, carefully review the powers, duties, and limitations you 

will have as a guardian, if you accept. 

A parent may appoint, or nominate, a person, or persons, in their will to act as guardian 

of their minor children should the parent die before their children reach 18 years of age. 

This is called a “testamentary appointment of a guardian.”  A court must approve the 

testamentary appointment.  The court approval process begins as part of the same 

probate case in North Dakota state district court that distributes the deceased parent’s 

property and debt. 

Chapter 30.1-27 of the North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.) lists the process and 

requirements for district court approval of a testamentary appointment of a guardian as 

part of the probate case to handle the deceased parent’s estate. 

The first step of the district court approval process is to accept or decline the 

testamentary appointment in writing.  The person appointed in the deceased parent’s 

will files their written acceptance or written declination with the district court within 60 

days of the death of the minor’s parent. 

The following pages list the powers, duties, and limitations of a guardian.

nature of the care, placement, and treatment of the child, including ordinary 

medical care as well as medical or surgical treatment for a serious physical 

condition or illness which in the opinion of a licensed physician requires 

prompt treatment, except for any limits the court may impose. 

b.  The right and duty to provide for the care, protection, training, and education 

and the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child, subject to the 

conditions and limitations of the order and to the remaining rights and duties 

of the child's parents.

the armed forces of the United States.

compensation for the guardian's services except as approved by order of the 

court or as determined by a duly appointed conservator other than the 

guardian.

that the guardian or the guardian's spouse have furnished to the minor unless

activities. 

5.  The guardian has the authority to facilitate the minor's education, social, or other 

6.  The guardian has the authority to authorize medical or other professional care, 

treatment, or advice. A guardian is not liable by reason of this consent for injury to 

the minor resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons unless it would have 

been illegal for a parent to have consented.

7.  A guardian shall file an annual report with the court regarding the exercise of the 

guardian’s powers and duties. 

a.  The report must describe the status or condition of the minor, including any 

change of residence and reasons for the change, any medical treatment 

received by or withheld from the minor, the minor's educational progress, any 

expenditure and income affecting the minor, and any exercise of legal

the minor's parents, unless the parents' rights have been terminated or the 

parents are deceased, and any interested persons designated by the court in 

its order. 

f.  If a guardian fails to file a complete annual report, fails to file a report at other 

times as the court may direct, or fails to provide an accounting of an estate, 

the court, upon its own motion or upon petition of any interested person, 

may issue an order compelling the guardian to show cause why the guardian 

should not immediately make and file the report or account, or be found in 

contempt for failure to comply. A copy of the order to show cause must be 

provided to the minor, if the minor is age fourteen or older, the minor's 

parents, unless the parents' rights have been terminated or the parents are

thirty days of the change, but must seek prior authorization of the court to establish 

or move the minor's residence outside of the state.

account the minor's preferences to the extent actually known or reasonably 

ascertainable by the guardian. 

10. To the extent reasonable, the guardian shall delegate to the minor responsibilities 

for decisions affecting the child's well-being. 

11. The guardian may not delegate authority as a guardian under a power of attorney 

without prior approval from the court.
