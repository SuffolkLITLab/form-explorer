      <pre>SERVICE INFORMATION FOR STARTING A CASE TO 
ESTABLISH GUARDIANSHIP OF AN ALLEGED INCAPACITATED ADULT 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided is not 
intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you will need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you must abide by the following: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you are held to same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you are unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

This information is not a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about 
the service requirements to start a guardianship of an alleged incapacitated adult in a North 
Dakota state district court.  The Center is not responsible for any consequences that may result 
from the information provided.  The information cannot replace the advice of competent legal 
counsel licensed in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

 

WARNING – Appointment of a guardian can have serious legal and financial 
consequences for both the ward and the guardian.  It is strongly recommended that 
you consult a lawyer and carefully consider all of your options before you represent 
yourself in a petition to appoint guardian for an incapacitated adult in a North Dakota 
state district court.

Service Info/Rev Nov 2019 

Proof of service tells the North Dakota state district court how, when and where 
the documents were served. 

If proof of service is not filed, the court will not act on the guardianship petition. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  If proof of service is not filed, the 
court will not act on your documents. 

The proof of service to start a guardianship of an alleged incapacitated adult tells the court 
when, how, and where the people listed at the top of Page 2 of 5 were served copies of the 
required documents. 

•  A certificate of service gives the court proof of service when a sheriff or other officer 

served the summons and a copy of the documents. 

•  An affidavit of service gives the court proof of service when a person other than a sheriff 

or other officer served the summons and a copy of the documents. 

The Petitioner, must locate the addresses or locations for service. 

Following are examples of ways to find people for service:  

•  Last known address. 

o  Contact the U.S. Post Office for information on how to determine if the 

defendant/respondent left a forwarding address. 

•  Friends, family, employers. 
•  Online search engines. 
•  Government entities, such as Department of Motor Vehicles or County Recorder. 
•  North Dakota business entity search, available at the ND Secretary of State website. 
•  Social Security Death Index. 
•  Utility companies. 
•  Social networking websites. 
•  Reverse directories. 

o  A reverse directory allows someone to search by phone number to find an 
address.  (Your local library may have access to reverse directories.)
