      <pre>MAKING A MOTION IN A CIVIL ACTION 
CHECKLIST 
 
This is a basic checklist for making a motion in a civil action in North Dakota State District 
Court.  There may be additional documents and procedures for your particular type of 
motion.  If you are unsure how to proceed, you should consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota. 

THE “MOTIONS” SECTION OF THE GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION on the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website has additional information and resources. 

A motion is a written request to the court for an order.  Motions may be made after the 
summons and complaint are filed with the court. 

The party making the motion is called the “Moving Party.” The party answering the motion is 
called the “Opposing Party.” 

A written motion in a civil action is made up of a set of documents, including: 

•  Notice of Motion; 
•  Motion; 
•  Brief in Support of Motion; 
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion; and 
•  Other Supporting Documents. 

Other documents may be required, depending on the court rule and/or law that apply to the 
type of motion you make. 

Is the Summons and Complaint (or Petition), Filed with the North Dakota State District Court? 

  Yes.  The case number is ___________________________. 

  No.  DO NOT CONTINUE.  Motions cannot be made until the summons and complaint 

(or petition) and proof of service of the summons and complaint are filed with the North 
Dakota State District Court.  Review the Guide to a Civil Action on the ND Legal Self Help 
Center website to determine how to proceed. 

Research North Dakota Laws and Court Rules: 

A motion to the court must include the legal authority that supports the motion request.  The 
moving party must explain how and why the law, case law, and/or court rule supports the 
request.

  Do any laws enacted by the North Dakota State Legislature support the motion request? 

The North Dakota Century Code contains laws enacted by the Legislature.  List any 
specific laws that support the request: _______________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 

  Does any North Dakota Supreme Court case law support the motion request? 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota State District Court to the 
North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how 
and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way they did. The 
opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with 
similar facts and issues. List the specific case law that supports the request:  
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 
 

  Do any court rules support the motion request? 

North Dakota Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the 
dispute is conducted.  List the specific court rules that support the request: 
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 
 

(The North Dakota Century Code, and North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and North Dakota 
court rules are also found in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries.)
