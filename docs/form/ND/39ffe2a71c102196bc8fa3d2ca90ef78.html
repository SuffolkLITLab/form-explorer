WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY GUARDIANSHIP? 

Any person interested in the welfare of an allegedly incapacitated adult person may petition for 
the appointment of an emergency guardian. 

A North Dakota state district court may appoint an emergency guardian of an adult if the court 
finds that using the non-emergency guardianship appointment process is likely to result in 
substantial harm to the adult’s health, safety, or welfare, and that no other person appears to 
have authority and willingness to act in the circumstances. 

A court hearing is required for all emergency guardianships. 

Court appointment of an emergency guardian isn’t a finding that the adult is incapacitated. 

An emergency guardianship can’t last more than 90 days. 

(For information about the process and requirements of appointing an emergency guardian 
before holding the required hearing, see the instructions and forms for Ex-Parte Appointment 
of an Emergency Guardian.  Please note, ex-parte appointment of an emergency guardian is 
available only in rare circumstances.) 

BEFORE USING THIS PACKET 

The appointment of a guardian severely limits or completely removes the right of the person to 
make their own decisions.  Consider other less restrictive options before petitioning for a 
guardianship. 

Less restrictive options to guardianship include, but aren’t limited to: 

•  Supported decision making; 
•  Power of attorney; 
•  Health care directive; 
•  Representative payee; or 
•  Home health care. 

The North Dakota Department of Human Services, Adults and Aging Services Division 
operates an Aging and Disability Resource Link.  carechoice.nd.assistguide.net

protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities in North Dakota.  The website gives

Chapter 30.1-01, Chapter 30.1-03, Chapter 30.1-26 and Chapter 30.1-28.  Refer to these 
Chapters when filling out the forms. 

•  The specific requirements for emergency adult guardianships are found in North Dakota 

Century Code (N.D.C.C.) Section 30.1-28-10.1 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows a District Court 
Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge, to hear and decide adult guardianship cases. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, administrative 
rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota law can be found 
in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota

DEFINITIONS 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they AREN’T intended to constitute 
legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

(See Chapter 30.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code for more definitions.) 

Alleged Incapacitated Person (See Incapacitated Person): An adult individual, who is alleged to 
be an incapacitated person, for whom an emergency adult guardianship is sought. 

Court appointment of an emergency guardian isn’t a finding that the adult is incapacitated. 

Emergency Guardian: A person appointed by a North Dakota District Court to make personal 
decisions for an alleged incapacitated person.  The appointment can last no more than 90 days. 

Ex-parte Appointment: An emergency appointment of a guardian that is ordered without first 
holding the required hearing, and without first giving notice to the alleged incapacitated person 
or other interested parties.  The alleged incapacitated person must be given notice within 48 
hours of the ex parte appointment.  A hearing must be held within 10 days of the ex parte 
appointment of a guardian. 

Guardian ad Litem: A lawyer appointed by a North Dakota District Court to advocate for the 
best interests of the alleged incapacitated person. 

Incapacitated Person: An adult individual who is impaired by reason of mental illness or 
deficiency, physical illness or disability, or chemical dependency to the extent that the person 
lacks capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions concerning that person's matters 
of residence, education, medical treatment, legal affairs, vocation, finance, or other matters, or 
which incapacity endangers the person's health or safety. 

Court appointment of an emergency guardian isn’t a finding that the adult is incapacitated. 

Judicial Referee: A judicial officer, appointed by the presiding District Court Judge, who has the 
authority to preside in adult guardianship proceedings.  The findings and order of the Judicial 
Referee have the effect of the findings and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court Judge. 

Least Restrictive Form of Intervention: The emergency guardianship imposed on the alleged 
incapacitated person must compensate for only those limitations necessary to provide the 
needed care and services, and that the alleged incapacitated person must enjoy the greatest 
amount of personal freedom and civil liberties consistent with the ward's mental and physical 
limitations. 

NDLSHC 

Page 5 of 16 

Emergency Guardian Adult/Rev Apr 2022 

Letters of Guardianship: A document signed by a North Dakota District Court that identifies the 
authority and limitations of the emergency guardian to make decisions on behalf of the alleged 
incapacitated person; identifies any other powers or authority given to the emergency guardian 
by the court; and identifies any limitations the court puts on the alleged incapacitated person in 
matters where powers aren’t granted to the emergency guardian. 

Limited Emergency Guardian: A person or nonprofit corporation, appointed by the court, to 
supervise certain specified aspects of the care of an alleged incapacitated person.  The 
appointment can last no more than 90 days. 

Petitioner: A person who presents an emergency adult guardianship petition to a North Dakota 
District Court. 

Venue: The place where the emergency guardianship petition is or will be filed.  Generally, in 
adult emergency guardianship proceedings, the venue is the North Dakota county where the 
alleged incapacitated person resides or is present and expected to remain for the duration of 
the emergency guardianship proceedings. 

A JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY HEAR AND DECIDE THE GUARDIANSHIP 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows adult guardianship 
cases to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the adult guardianship case, any party to the case may 
request that a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a 
written request with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of 
hearing. 

If the adult guardianship is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will 
issue findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the 
same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the adult guardianship case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of 
fact and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons 
for the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review.  

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

state employee in the performance of official duties.

STEP 8  –  Attend the hearing. 

You, the petitioner, must be prepared to present evidence showing why the emergency 
guardianship is necessary, and evidence that notice of the hearing was given to all persons 
required to receive notice. 

The alleged incapacitated person must attend the hearing in person.   

If you plan to ask the court to find that there is good cause to excuse the alleged incapacitated 
person’s attendance at the hearing, you, the petitioner, must provide evidence of good cause.  
(Good cause doesn’t consist only of the physical difficulty of the alleged incapacitated person to 
attend the hearing.) 

The alleged incapacitated person has the right to present evidence, and to cross-examine 
witnesses. 

The judge or judicial referee presiding over the hearing will issue a written order granting or 
denying the appointment of an emergency guardian. 

REQUIREMENTS AFTER THE COURT APPOINTMENT OF AN 
EMERGENCY GUARDIAN 

Letters of Guardianship: 

If the court appoints an emergency guardian after the hearing, the court will issue an order and 
letters of emergency guardianship.  To accept the duties of emergency guardian, the 
emergency guardian appointed by the court must sign the letters of emergency guardianship. 

You, the petitioner, must serve a copy of the order to all persons given notice of the emergency 
guardianship proceedings, and any other persons the court may direct. 

You, the petitioner, must mail copies of the signed letters of emergency guardianship to the 
alleged incapacitated person and the alleged incapacitated person’s attorney. 

See Step 6 for service and proof of service. 

Emergency Guardianships can last NO MORE than 90 days. 

Reporting Requirements: 

Emergency guardians may be required by the court to file reports.  Review the order appointing 
the emergency guardian and follow any reporting requirements.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
