level  of  hard-to-count  populations 

The  2020  Census  is  quickly  approaching.  North 
Dakota’s  hard-to-count  populations  have  been 
identified  as  oilfield  workers,  Native  Americans, 
college  students,  and  the  federal  military.  The 
second 
is 
new  immigrants,  frontier  counties,  seniors,  and 
the  homeless.  The  third  level  of  hard-to-count 
populations  is  children  under  five.  An  accurate 
census  is  important  for  so  many  reasons.  We  are 
expected  to  surpass  our  highest  population,  
which  was  set  in  the  1930  census.  There  are 
not  only  federal  programs  but  also  state-level  
programs  that  are  reliant  on  the  population  to 
determine  at  least  part  of  the  level  of  funding  
received.  The  State  Library’s  federal  dollars  are 
based  partially  on  population.  For  every  one  
person  that  is  missed  in  the  census,  the  state  will 
lose  approximately  $19,100  in  federal  dollars  over 
the next ten years. 

There  are  many  ways  that  libraries  of  all  types  
can  be  involved  in  assisting  with  the  census.  We 
will  be  sharing  two  images  that  you  can  use  as

census on social media.

information  on  your  social

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

I  was  honored  to  be 
invited  to  attend  
Governor  Burgum’s  2020  State  of  the  State 
Address  in  Grand  Forks.  I  learned—or  was 
reminded  of—quite  a  few  facts  about  our  
state.  My  biggest  takeaway  is  that  this  is  a  
great  time  to  be  a  North  Dakotan.  North  
Dakota  has  been  ranked  the  third  best  state  
to  raise  a  family  and  the  best  state  for  
millennials. We’ve experienced thirteen percent 
growth in the last decade and are expected to 
have  our  highest  state  population  since  the 
1930 census. 

Ninety  percent  of  the  land  in  North  Dakota 
is  privately  owned  farm  and  ranch  land,  so 
agriculture  is  definitely  still  an  important  part  
of our state. North Dakota is the lead producer  
in  the  country  of  oats,  canola,  flaxseed,  
sunflower,  spring  wheat,  durum  wheat,  dry 
edible  peas,  and  honey.  We’ve  been  the  top 
producer  of  honey  for  the  last  fifteen  years.  
We  are  the  second  highest  producer  of  
crude  oil,  the  sixth  highest  producer  of 
ethanol,  seventh  for  wind,  eighth  for  coal,  and 
tenth  for  natural  gas  and  biodiesel.  Governor 
Burgum  talked  about  some  of  the  research  
and  development  that  is  being  done  in  the  
state in the area of fuels and how we can better 
utilize  fossil  fuels  in  a  more  environmentally 
friendly way. We have over two thousand wind 
turbines in North Dakota, and blades for some 
of them are built in our state. 

We  have  had  sixteen  federal  level  cabinet  
visits  to  North  Dakota  in  the  last  three  years. 
There  is  interest  in  our  R&D  projects  in  the  
areas  of  energy,  agriculture,  and  technology. 
We  are  leading  the  country  in  research  into 

unmanned  aircraft.  At  the  presentation,  the 
Governor’s  remote  for  his  presentation  was 
delivered  to  him  via  drone,  which  was  pretty 
cool.  Technology  is  now  our  third  economic  
area,  although  tourism  is  the  third  economic 
area  when  you  look  at  the  gross  domestic 
product (GDP). 

Governor  Burgum  gave  an  update  on  the 
initiatives  that  his  administration 
strategic 
focuses on. Those initiatives are Main Street ND, 
reinventing  government,  tribal  relationships, 
transforming  education,  and  behavioral  health 
and  addiction.  Much  progress  has  been  made 
in  each  of  these  areas.  He  also  shared  his 
administration’s  cultural  aspirations  which  are 
citizen-focused,  growth  mindset, 
leadership 
everywhere,  to  work  as  one,  and  make  a 
difference  for  the  citizens  of  North  Dakota.

These

Dakota citizens.

increased 

One  of  the  things  that  I  appreciate  most  
about  Governor  Burgum  and  Lieutenant 
Governor  Sanford  is  that  they  lead  from  a 
place  of  gratitude.  The  values  of  gratitude, 
curiosity,  humility,  and  courage  inform  and 
guide  their  leadership  of  our  great  state,  and  
I  am  in  turn  grateful  to  be  living  and  working  
in  a  state  that  cherishes  and 
lives  these  
values.  To  quote  Governor  Burgum,  “We 
are  strong,  growing,  and  full  of  boundless 
opportunity,  and  it  is  indeed  a  great  time  to  
be a North Dakotan!”

that  can  help!  Mango  Languages

or state library card.

Mango  Languages  offers  over  70 
each  with  a  set  number  of  units,  chapters,  and 
lessons  that  will  take  you  from  the  basics  to  
the  more  advanced  areas.  Some  of  the  languages  have  robust  units  that  will  help  you  gain  
fluency. There are also lessons on subjects like slang, superstition, and English loanwords.

As  of  2020,  Mango  Languages  has  a  new  feature:  family  profiles.  One  person  can  create  an  
account  and  then  add  subsequent  logins  for  their  spouse  or  children.  This  way,  a  child  does  
not have to have a separate library card or e-mail address.

Visit your local public library’s website to access Mango Languages.

Introduction To The New Public Access Catalog: Getting Started

There  have  been  a  lot  of  questions  about  our  new  Public  Access  Catalog  (PAC).  This  is  the  first  in  
a  series  of  articles  that  will  explain  the  basic  operations  of  the  new  catalog  to  provide  you  with  
some guidance.

First  of  all,  if  you  have  PRIMO  bookmarked  in  your 
browser  or  on  your  desktop,  be  aware  that  the  
only  function  that  is  still  active  in  PRIMO  is  article  
searching.  If  you  are  trying  to  request  an  item,  you  will  
need  to  use  the  new  PAC,  and  any  materials  checked  
out  will  only  be  displayed  in  the  new  PAC.  So,  if  you  
are  using  PRIMO  to  search  for  books,  DVD,  and  other 
materials  that  are  not  articles,  you  won’t  find  what  you  
are looking for. 

The  new  ODIN  Public  Access  Catalog  works  best  when 
using FireFox or Google Chrome.

In  the  upper  left  corner,  you  will  see  a  dropdown  box.  This  
allows  you  to  select  all  ODIN  libraries  or  a  specific  library,  such  
as the North Dakota State Library.

Next  to  the  Library  dropdown  box,  you  have  the  option  of 
increasing  the  size  of  the  text  and  screen  size  by  clicking  
“Large Text.” 

In the far right-hand corner, you’ll find the Log In. 

Logging  into  your  account  is  the  same  as  before.  If  you  are  
having  difficulty  logging  in  or  forgot  your  password,  you  can  
reset  your  password  by  clicking  the  “forgot  your  password”  
link.  You  will  then  receive  an  e-mail  with  a  link  to  change  
your password.

If  you  don’t  want  to  use  your  barcode  to  sign  in,  you  can  
create  a  new  username.  However,  you  will  need  your  barcode  
and  password  to  set  up  your  username.  If  you  don’t  already  have  a  State  Library  card,  you  can  
register for one by clicking on the “Click here to register now” link. Once we finish processing your new  
card, we will send it to you through the mail. 

Next  month’s  article  will  go  into  more  details  about  the  home  screen,  but  here  are  brief  descriptions  
of some of the other features you’ll find on the PAC:

Library Info - takes you back to the home screen and also has an “Ask Us” question box. To use the “Ask  
Us” feature, you will need to be signed in.

Search - provides you with different search options.

My Account - this is where you’ll find what items you have checked out, make renewals, see if you owe  
any fines, etc. You must be signed in to use My Account.

Help - offers helpful hints on different types of searches.

If  you  have  are  having  any  trouble  with  the  new  catalog  or  need  further  assistance  on  navigating  
your way around it, please contact our Public Services Department at 1-800-472-2104 or statelib@nd.gov.

I  have  a  fun  new  programming  opportunity  for  any  library  that  would  like  to  participate.  And,  
even better, it is FREE!!!

To  start  off,  the  RRRS  is  asking  for  our  help  in  arranging  a  program  tour. They  will  be  applying  
for the Humanities North Dakota Quick Grant in February to cover expenses involved in traveling  
to  libraries  outside  of  Fargo.  Since  they  will  be  applying  for  this  grant,  they  asked  if  we  could  
help with the following in a timely manner:

•  Create  a  lineup  of  approximately  12  public  libraries  for  RRRS  to  visit  and  present  their  oral  

history program between April and October of 2020

  These  folks  have  day  jobs,  so  they’re  looking  to  only  have  1  library  visit  scheduled  per  
week.  However,  they  are  looking  into  possibly  doing  a  2-3  day  tour  to  get  to  all  the  
libraries around the state.

  There is no charge to the libraries for this program.

f  your  library  is  interested  in  being  a  host  site  for  the  RRRS,  please  respond  to  me  personally  
at  dcl@nccray.net,  and  I’ll  take  care  of  handing  over  all  the  information  to  Larry  Pederson,  
Coordinator of the RRRS.

...that  almost  40%  of  North  Dakotans  that  have  library  access  to  library  
service  have  library  cards?  In  smaller  communities,  60–70%  of  residents  
have library cards.

There’s  something  incredibly  comforting  about

star  players  of  genre.  Once  you’re  hooked,  few

overview  of  some  new  titles  coming  out  this  
year should show why.

A  jilted  wedding  planner  has  to  work  with  the 
man  who  ruined  her  wedding  in  Mia  Sosa’s  The

the  wedding,  but  she  threw  herself  into  work  
and  eventually  managed  to  land  a  huge  hotel 
magnate  as  a  client.  Just  when  she  thinks  she’s 
really  turning  things  around,  Max  shows  back 
up  as  the  client’s  marketing  expert,  and  not  all

YouTube Video of the Month:  
Library 101: FOIA

This  month’s  video  is  a  Library  101,  but  it  deals  with  
a  topic  that  everyone  has  heard  of  but  nobody  
really  knows  a  lot  about.  This  video  will  go  over  the 
Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA).  Because  it  is  a 
Library 101, the video discusses the basics FOIA, why 
it’s  important,  and  some  of  the  ways  that  the  act  is 
enforced.  Don’t  miss  out  on  this  quick  informational 
video for an important topic to librarians.

Program Spotlight: Intergenerational Gardening

It  may  be  February,  but  let’s  think  Spring.  Help  your  patrons  get  a  jump  start  on  their  
flowerbeds  and  gardens  by  hosting  an  all-ages  planting  program.  Planting  seeds  in  the  
late  winter  allows  them  to  germinate  inside  in  the  relative  warmth  without  freezing  
outdoors.  By  planting  early,  vegetables,  herbs,  and  flowers  will  bloom  earlier  and  for  
longer  in  the  season.  See  if  your  local  Extension  Office  would  be  interested  in  hosting  a  
class  on  planting  seeds  and  caring  for  them  before  they  get  transplanted  when  the  
ground  thaws.  Young  and  old  alike  will  enjoy  this  program  as  adults  help  children  learn  
more about where their food comes from and how their favorite flowers prepare to bloom.

Course of the Month: 
How To Handle Angry Customers

This  month’s  course,  “How  to  Handle  Angry 
Customers,”  can  be  found  in  the  Niche  Academy 
database.  Unlike  Universal  Class,  the  courses  in 
Niche  Academy  allow  you  to  jump  around  the 
lesson,  do  not  require  login  information,  and  
do not provide continuing education units. 

This  course  begins  with  an  introduction  into  the  subject  matter  and  then  will  walk  you  through  
or  patron.  The  course  also  includes  tips  on  how  to  not  take  things  personally  and  techniques 
for  de-escalating  an  angry  customer. The  lessons  are  brief,  so  it  shouldn’t  take  more  than  one  or  
two hours to complete.

Legal Research Resources for Eviction

   

 

FEBRUARY 2020

Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

Eviction  is  a  frequently  requested  legal  research  
topic  by  self-represented  patrons  of  the  North 
Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library  and  North 
Dakota Legal Self Help Center.

Personal  Property:  anything 
real 
property.  For  example,  furniture,  dishes,  clothing, 
and appliances.

isn’t 

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources  
in North Dakota for evictions.

What is Eviction?

to  determine 

Eviction  is  an  accelerated,  or  sped  up,  civil  court 
to  physically  
the 
action 
possess  the  leased  property.  The  action  is  also 
referred  to  as  forcible  detainer. The  eviction  action 
only  involves  possession  of  real  property  (real 
estate), rather than personal property.

right 

A  landlord  may  evict  a  tenant  for  one  or  more  
of  the  eight  reasons  for  eviction  allowed  by  
North  Dakota 
landlord  can’t  evict  a  
tenant  without  an  order  from  a  North  Dakota  
state  district  court  that  says  the  landlord  met  
all of the legal requirements.

law.  A 

Because  eviction 
is  an  accelerated  civil  court  
process,  North  Dakota  eviction  law  strictly  limits  
the  ability  to  combine  eviction  with  other  claims 
related to the lease agreement.

Eviction Definitions

Lease: an oral or written contract where a landlord 
gives  a  tenant  the  temporary  possession  and  use  
of  real  property  for  reward  and  the  tenant  agrees  
to return possession to the landlord at a future time.

Lessor/Landlord:  the  person  who  rents  or  leases 
real property to another.

Lessee/Tenant: the person who rents or leases real 
property from a lessor/landlord.

Real  Property:  real  or  immovable  land,  including 
anything  that  is  fixed  to  the  land  that  is  incidental 
or  immovable  by  law.  For  example,  an  apartment 
within  an  apartment  building,  a  condominium 
within a complex, a house, or a room within a house.

Writ  of  Execution  (also  called  Writ  of  Execution  
for  Possession,  Writ  of  Restitution,  or  Writ  of  
Eviction):  an  order  from  a  North  Dakota  state 
district  court  judge  or  judicial  referee  needed 
to  give  physical  possession  of  the  real  property  
back  to  the  landlord.  A  writ  of  execution  can’t 
be  issued  until  after  the  judge  or  judicial  referee  
orders  that  the  landlord  met  all  of  the  legal 
requirements for eviction.

Eviction Process

In  North  Dakota,  a 
landlord  may  begin  the  
eviction  process  when  one  or  more  of  the  eight 
reasons for eviction exist.

The  most  common  reasons  for  eviction  are  failing 
to  pay  the  rent  more  than  3  days  after  its  due, 
remaining  in  the  property  after  the  end  of  the  
lease,  and  violating  a  material  term  of  the  written 
lease agreement. 

Step  One:  the  landlord  arranges  to  serve  the  
tenant a 3 day notice of intention to evict. The 3  
day  notice  of  intention  to  evict  is  a  document  
that  gives  the  tenant  notice  the  landlord  intends  
to  evict  the  tenant.  The  tenant  has  3  days  to  
comply  before  the 
landlord  begins  the  court  
process for eviction.

For  4  of  the  8  reasons  to  evict,  a  3  day  notice  of 
intention  to  evict  is  required  before  the  landlord  
can start the court process.

Continued from pg. 12

Step Two:  the  tenant  is  served  a  summons  and 
complaint  for  eviction. 
If  the  tenant  doesn’t 
comply  with  the  3  day  notice  of  intention  to 
evict,  or  if  the  3  day  notice  of  intention  to  evict 
wasn’t  required,  the  landlord  arranges  to  have  
the  summons  and  complaint  for  eviction  served  
on the tenant. 

Service  of  the  summons  and  complaint  on  the 
tenant  starts  the  court  process  for  eviction.  The 
process  moves  very  quickly  once  the  summons  
and complaint are served.

Step  Three:  the  eviction  hearing 
is  held  
within  3  to  15  days  from  the  date  the  tenant 
was  served.  North  Dakota  eviction  laws  require 
that  the  eviction  hearing  occur  within  3  to  15  
days  from  the  date  the  tenant  was  served  the 
summons and complaint.

If  the

landlord  met  all  of  the  legal  requirements  to  
evict  the  tenant,  the  tenant  can  be  evicted  the  
same  day  as  the  hearing.  However,  during  the 
hearing  the  tenant  can  ask  for  up  to  5  days  to  
move out.

Step  Four:  the  tenant  must  move  out  by  the  
date  in  the  eviction  order.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
