An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Juvenile Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves in 
civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this informational guide 
isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a juvenile court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this information 
suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

•  For more information about finding a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-

lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about the 
process of registering an out-of-state or tribal court minor guardianship order with a North Dakota 
juvenile court.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the 
information provided.  The information can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed 
in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

IMPORTANT! Registration alone DOESN’T transfer the entire case to North Dakota.

SECTION ONE: 

INFORMATION ABOUT REGISTERING AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT MINOR GUARDIANSHIP ORDER 

WHAT IS REGISTERING AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT MINOR 
GUARDIANSHIP ORDER? 

An out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order is an order issued by an out-of-
state court or a tribal court that governs the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation of a 
minor child.  The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) has the 
requirements. 

Out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship cases are called child custody proceedings. 

When these minor guardianship cases result in orders governing legal custody, physical 
custody, or visitation, the orders are called child custody determinations. 

•  The child custody determination may be a permanent, temporary, initial, or 

modification order. 

If an out-of-state court or tribal court issued a minor guardianship order granting you legal 
custody, physical custody, or visitation, you may ask a North Dakota juvenile court to register 
your out-of-state court or tribal court order for recognition in North Dakota. 

Any person awarded legal custody, physical custody, or visitation in the minor guardianship 
order may contest, or challenge, the registration for limited reasons. 

The effect of registering an order is the North Dakota juvenile court recognizes the following: 

1.  The out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order exists; 
2.  The order is currently in effect; and 
3.  The order is the most current order in the out-of-state court or tribal court case. 

Registration is the first step BEFORE making other requests, such as enforcing the out-of-state 
court or tribal court minor guardianship order. 

IMPORTANT! Registration alone DOESN’T transfer the entire case to North Dakota.  The entire 
minor guardianship case remains with the out-of-state court or tribal court until the out-of-
state court or tribal court says they give up their authority (jurisdiction), AND a North Dakota 
juvenile court says they’ll take over authority (jurisdiction).

Reg OOS/Tribal Grdshp Order/Jan 2022 

CAN OTHER TYPES OF OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR 
VISITATION ORDERS BE REGISTERED? 

Yes, but you can’t use this Informational Guide to do so. 

The ND Legal Self Help Center has an Informational Guide for registering custody or visitation 
order for non-guardianship cases at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/foreign-custody-and-
visitation.  Scroll to the “Informational Guides” section. 

COURTS WHOSE MINOR GUARDIANSHIP ORDERS MAY BE REGISTERED 

Minor guardianship orders issued by a court of the following may be registered using the 
process in this Informational Guide: 

•  A state of the United States; 
•  The District of Columbia; 
•  Puerto Rico; 
•  United States Virgin Islands; 
•  Any territory or insular possession of the United States; 
•  An Indian tribe or band, or Alaskan native village, which is recognized by federal law or 

formally acknowledged by a state of the United States; and 

•  A foreign country, if certain requirements are met.  (See Chapter 14-14.1.) 

WHAT IF I NEED NORTH DAKOTA TO ENFORCE MY OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT MINOR GUARDIANSHIP ORDER? 

Enforcing an out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order is a two-step process. 

Step One: Registration is the first step to request that a North Dakota juvenile court enforce 
your out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order. 

Step Two: Petitioning for expedited enforcement is the second step to request that a North 
Dakota juvenile court enforce the custody or visitation terms of your registered out-of-state 
court or tribal court minor guardianship order. 

However, the two steps may be combined when you need to petition a North Dakota juvenile 
court for expedited (sped up) enforcement, but haven’t yet registered the out-of-state court or 
tribal court minor guardianship order.

The ND Legal Self Help Center has an Informational Guide for asking a North Dakota state court 
to enforce an out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order at ndcourts.gov/legal-
self-help/foreign-custody-and-visitation.  Scroll to the “Informational Guides” section. 

WHAT IF I NEED TO TRANSFER THE ENTIRE OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL 
COURT MINOR GUARDIANSHIP CASE TO NORTH DAKOTA? 

In order for a North Dakota juvenile court to allow the transfer of an entire out-of-state court or 
tribal court minor guardianship case to North Dakota, both the North Dakota juvenile court and 
the out-of-state court or tribal court need to agree that North Dakota should take over 
authority (jurisdiction) of the entire case. 

Transferring an out-of-state court or tribal court guardianship case to North Dakota is a 
complicated and confusing process.  The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have information or 
resources available.  Consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota for assistance. 

WHAT IF I NEED NORTH DAKOTA TO MODIFY MY OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT MINOR GUARDIANSHIP ORDER? 

In order for a North Dakota juvenile court to modify the custody or visitation terms of an out-
of-state or tribal court guardianship of minor order, the entire case must be transferred to 
North Dakota. 

Modifying the order may only happen AFTER a North Dakota juvenile court accepts the transfer 
of the entire minor guardianship case and takes over authority (jurisdiction) for the case. 

Asking a North Dakota juvenile court to modify the custody or visitation terms of an out-of-
state court or tribal court minor guardianship order is a complicated and confusing process.  
The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have information or resources available.  Consult a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota for assistance. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE FORMS TO REGISTER AN OUT-OF-
STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT MINOR GUARDIANSHIP ORDER, OR TO 
CHALLENGE REGISTRATION OF THE ORDER? 

Yes, this Informational Guide includes forms you may use to register your out-of-state court 
or tribal court minor guardianship order, and to challenge registration of the order.  There is 
no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self 
Help Center. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 4 of 15 

Reg OOS/Tribal Grdshp Order/Jan 2022 

If the form you need isn’t included in this guide, the form isn’t available through the ND Legal 
Self Help Center. You may need to create some of your own legal documents. 

If a form isn’t available and you need to create your own legal document, a variety of General-
Use template forms for juvenile court are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/juvenile-
general-use-forms. 

You may find the General-Use template forms of interest as a starting point for creating your 
own legal documents. 

DEFINITIONS OF SOME COMMONLY USED TERMS 

(In 2009, the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “custody” to “residential 
responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

Child custody determination: An out-of-state court or tribal court judgment, decree, or other 
order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation of a minor child. 
The term includes a permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order. The term doesn’t 
include an order relating to child support or other monetary obligation of an individual. 

Child custody proceeding: An out-of-state court or tribal court proceeding in which legal 
custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a minor child is an issue. The term 
includes a proceeding for divorce, separation, neglect, abuse, dependency, guardianship, 
paternity, termination of parental rights, and protection from domestic violence, in which the 
issue may appear. The term doesn’t include a proceeding involving juvenile delinquency, 
contractual emancipation, or enforcement under North Dakota Century Code Sections 14-14.1-
22 through 14-14.1-37. 

District Court: The state trial courts of general jurisdiction with service in all 53 counties.

Reg OOS/Tribal Grdshp Order/Jan 2022 

Juvenile Court: North Dakota juvenile courts are a subset of North Dakota state district courts.  
Juvenile courts have jurisdiction over guardianships of children who are under the age of 18.  
Juvenile courts protect the best interests of children and address the unique characteristics and 
needs of children in guardianship matters. 

Jurisdiction: Jurisdiction is the power of a court to inquire into the facts, apply the law, and 
determine and pronounce judgment.  Generally speaking, there are two types of jurisdiction, 
subject matter and personal. 

•  Subject Matter Jurisdiction: A court’s power to hear and determine the type of case or 
controversy.  Comes from the constitution and statutes (laws enacted by a legislature).  
Subject matter jurisdiction can’t be agreed to, consented to, or waived. 

•  Personal Jurisdiction: A court’s power over the parties.  A party can voluntarily submit to 

the personal jurisdiction of a court. 

Minor child: An individual under 18 years of age. 

Modified determination: Changes, replaces, supersedes, or is otherwise made after a previous 
child custody determination concerning the same child, whether or not it is made by the court 
that made the previous determination. 

Person acting as a parent: A person, other than a parent, who has been awarded legal custody 
by an out-of-state court or tribal court whose custody order may be registered. 

Stayed determination: Temporary suspension of a child custody determination.  The decision 
to stay a child custody determination is made by a court. 

Vacated determination: To set aside or void a child custody determination.  The decision to 
vacate a child custody determination is made by a court. 

Venue: The location (North Dakota county) in which the North Dakota Juvenile Court will hear 
the case.  Venue is determined only after jurisdiction is determined.

Your declaration must contain the following: 

•  A statement under penalty of perjury that to the best of your knowledge and belief the 

minor guardianship order you want to register hasn’t been modified. 

o  This means that the order you’re trying to register is the most recent order of

Make a copy of your completed declaration for your records.  You’ll file the original with the 
Clerk of Court in Step Two.

General-Use forms available at the ND Legal Self Help Center website: 

If the forms available at the end of this Informational Guide don’t suit your circumstances, 
you’ll need to create your own registration documents to suit your circumstances.  Go to 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/juvenile-general-use-forms. 

STEP TWO: THE PETITIONER FILES THEIR REGISTRATION DOCUMENTS WITH 
THE CLERK OF COURT 

Decide the venue (North Dakota county) to file your registration documents: 

You, the Petitioner, need to decide the venue (North Dakota county) of the North Dakota 
Juvenile Court to file your registration documents. 

North Dakota’s Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) doesn’t 
specifically state how to decide venue for registration. 

Since the answer isn’t clear, the answer requires interpreting the law for your situation.  This is 
legal advice, which can’t be provided by the ND Legal Self Help Center under any circumstances. 

However, the Center can provide the following legal research starting points for you to research 
where to file your registration documents yourself: 

•  You may wish to review the venue requirements for guardianships of minors that start 
in North Dakota juvenile court.  Review Section 27-20.1-04 of the North Dakota Century 
Code to decide where to file. 

•  You may also wish to review Chapter 28-04 of the North Dakota Century Code to decide 

where to file. 

If you would like assistance deciding where to file your registration documents, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota.

File your registration documents: 

File the following documents with the Clerk of Court: 

1.  The original letter, petition, or other document requesting registration of the out-of-

state court or tribal court minor guardianship order; 

2.  The original declaration to request registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court 

minor guardianship order;

If you’re required to pay a $10.00 filing fee and are unable to pay due to financial hardship, a 
Filing Fee Waiver Request form set is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver.  File 
the completed forms at the same time as your registration documents. 

If you have questions about how you may submit your documents for filing, or if you’re 
required to pay the filing fee, contact information for Clerks of Court by county is available at 
ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

STEP THREE: NOTICE OF REGISTRATION IS GIVEN BY THE CLERK OF COURT

Clerk of Court serves (gives) written notice of the registration to the other persons awarded 
legal custody, physical custody, or visitation in the out-of-state court or tribal court minor 
guardianship order. 

Commonly, the notice of registration is served (given) by mailing the written notice. 

The following information is included in the notice of registration (continues on next page): 

•  The registered child custody determination is enforceable as of the date of registration 

in the same way a North Dakota custody determination may be enforced;

determination must be requested within twenty days after service of the notice of 
registration; and 

•  Failure to contest or challenge the registration will result in confirmation of the child 

custody determination and preclude further contest of that determination with respect 
to any matter that could have been asserted. 

An example of a notice of registration that was served by a Clerk of District Court as part of the 
registration process is found at the end of this Informational Guide. 

STEP FOUR: WITHIN 20 DAYS OF NOTICE OF REGISTRATION, ANY PERSON 
AWARDED LEGAL CUSTODY, PHYSICAL CUSTODY, OR VISITATION 
(RESPONDENTS) MAY CHALLENGE THE REGISTRATION BY REQUESTING A 
HEARING IN WRITING 

After service of the notice of registration, other persons awarded legal custody, physical 
custody, or visitation in the out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order have 20 
days to request a hearing in writing to contest or challenge the registration. 

Challenges to the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order are limited: 

Contests, or challenges, to registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court minor 
guardianship order are limited to the following: 

1.  The court that issued the out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order 

didn’t have jurisdiction to issue the order. 

o  See North Dakota Century Code Sections 14-14.1-12 through 14-14.1-21 for 

jurisdiction requirements that apply to this challenge. 

2.  The out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order sought to be registered 

has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court that had jurisdiction to do so. 

3.  The person contesting registration was entitled to notice before the out-of-state court 
or tribal court minor guardianship order was made by the court that issued the order, 
but notice wasn’t given according to the standards of North Dakota Century Code 
Section 14-14.1-07. 

o  See North Dakota Century Code Section 14-14.1-07 for the notice standards that 

apply to this challenge.

Reg OOS/Tribal Grdshp Order/Jan 2022 

You, the person contesting registration, create the written request for hearing to contest, or 
challenge, registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order: 

The person contesting, or challenging, registration must be awarded legal custody, physical 
custody, or visitation in the out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order. 

A form to request a hearing to contest registration of an out-of-state court or tribal court minor 
guardianship order is found at the end of this Informational Guide. 

•  Fill out the caption (top) of the form EXACTLY the same as the caption of the petition to 

register the out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order. 

Make a copy of your completed request for your records. 

You, the person contesting registration, file the written request for hearing with the Clerk of 
Court: 

The person requesting the hearing files their original written request for hearing document with 
the Clerk of Court in the North Dakota county where the order was registered. 

Contact information for clerks of court by county is available at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

STEP FIVE (A): ATTEND THE HEARING (If Requested and Scheduled) 

If a hearing is requested within 20 days of notice of registration AND the hearing was 
scheduled, ATTEND THE HEARING: 

The person contesting or challenging registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court minor 
guardianship order is required to prove their reason or reasons at the hearing. 

The Petitioner who registered the out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order 
may challenge the proof the person who requested the hearing presents at the hearing. 

If the person who contested, or challenged, registration doesn’t prove their reason(s), the 
North Dakota Juvenile Court judge or judicial referee confirms the registered order.

STEP FIVE (B): IF A HEARING ISN’T REQUESTED WITHIN 20 DAYS OF NOTICE OF 
REGISTRATON, REGISTRATION IS CONFIRMED. 

If a hearing ISN’T requested to contest or challenge registration within 20 days of notice of 
registration: 

If a hearing isn’t requested within 20 days after the service of the notice of registration, 
registration is confirmed and the parties are notified of the confirmation. 

The effect of a confirmed registration is that the North Dakota Juvenile Court recognizes the 
following: 

1. The out-of-state court or tribal court minor guardianship order exists;
2. The order is currently in effect; and
3. The order is the most current order in the out-of-state court or tribal court minor

guardianship case.

Registration is the first step BEFORE making other requests, such as enforcing your out-of-state 
court or tribal court minor guardianship order.
