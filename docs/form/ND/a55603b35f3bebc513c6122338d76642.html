MARCH MADNESS - BOOK BATTLES
 
March  is  coming  fast  and  you  know  what  that 
means:  March  Madness!  The  North  Dakota  State

element or competition in it.

Be on the lookout for the bracket, which will need 
to be completed and sent to the State Library prior

for your winners starting on Tuesday, March 19.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

offering  so  much  more  than  literacy  though. 
Technology  and  STEM  programs,  cooking  and 
food programs, bookclubs, craft programs… the 
list of programs goes on and on. At least weekly, 
and usually more often, I see a program on the 
website of a ND library and think “man, I wish I 
lived closer” or “I sure wish I had a Librarian for a 
Day visit scheduled at that library on the day of 
that program” (You can consider that a not-so-
subtle hint to invite me to your library. <grin>)

Libraries have books in many formats, along with 
magazines,  newspapers,  journals,  microfilms, 
and so many other materials. I love books. Plain 
and  simple.  I  enjoy  reading,  as  I  think  most 
librarians  and  library  staff  do.  I  read  e-books 
more  often  these  days  than  hard  copy  books  
and  I’ve  really  started  to  take  advantage  of 
RBdigital  for  e-books  and  e-magazines.  I  enjoy 
listening  to  audiobooks  in  my  car,  when  I  do 
tasks  around  the  house  and  when  I  walk  from 
my car into work each morning. 

I saved my favorite thing about libraries for last 
and  that  is  the  greatest  resource  any  and  all 
libraries  have,  which  is  the  library  staff.  Library 
staff members are by their very nature a helpful 
lot,  and  not  just  while  working  in  the  library. 
They have a passion for service and for service 
to  all  people.  Library  staff  are  kind  and  caring 
individuals.  They  go  above  and  beyond  in  the 
services they provide. 

I am honored to be a part of the at-large library 
community  for  reasons  too  numerous  to  list.  I 
am  extremely  honored  and  grateful  to  be  part 
of  the  North  Dakota  library  community.  I  have 
witnessed so many reasons to celebrate Library 
Lovers  Month  in  February  across  all  types  of 
libraries in our state. 

list 

it  on  their  calendar  of 

February  is  Library  Lovers  Month.  At  least  it  is

sites.  The  American  Library  Association  (ALA)

doesn’t 
celebrations  and  I  was  unable  to  determine 
the  history  of 
I  even  called  Sarah  at  
Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library who 
checked  Chase’s  Calendar  of  Events,  one  of  my 
favorite  reference  books  ever,  and  while  the 
month  was  listed,  no  additional  information  
was provided.

it. 

e  that  as  it  may,  any  month  that  is  called 
Library Lovers Month is one I want to celebrate.  
Shout  it  from  the  rooftops,  post  it  on  social 
media and tell everyone you meet on the street. 
There are so many reasons to love libraries and 
I’ll share my top five. 

  B

Libraries serve everyone regardless of ethnicity, 
social  or  economic  status,  educational  level 
achieved,  or  many  other  reasons  that  people 
are denied service. Some have said that libraries  
are  the  last  bastion  of  service  to  all  peoples  
and I think there is truth to that. 

Libraries  meet  the  needs  of  the  community 
that they serve simply to meet the community’s 
needs, not for any other angle or hidden agenda. 
We  exist  to  serve  the  community.  Period  and 
end of story. (No pun intended.)

Libraries of today provide so many opportunities 
for  people  to  connect  with  resources,  other 
people, services, and to meet their educational 
and  recreational  needs.  We  offer  programs  for 
all  ages,  most  often  at  no  cost  to  participants. 
As  far  as  I  know,  all  public  libraries  in  North 
Dakota offer some type of early literacy program 
such  as  storytime.  Libraries  of  all  types  are

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

TUTORND

It’s that time of year again, when students are frantically studying for ACTs or SATs. Perhaps they are 
already thinking about those AP tests that are coming up towards the end of the semester. 

TutorND is the one stop resource for all of these tests. The tutoring service is available every day 
from 3:00PM–10:00PM (CST). Tutoring can be done either through the chat feature or the video 
chat option for their session. 

In addition to live tutoring, a student can go into the Skills Center to find legitimate resources to 
help  them  study  for  the  ACT  and  SAT. While  they  are  studying,  they  can  pop  in  with  a  tutor  to 
get any questions they have answered. These resources are some of the same ones used by name 
brand tutoring places, but are provided to your students through the library. The system doesn’t 
require a login but there is an option for a free account where all study materials can be saved in 
one spot. Check out all of its features at www.tutornd.com. 

If you have any questions about TutorND please email us at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

A NEW DATABASE IS AVAILABLE FOR NORTH DAKOTA LIBRARIANS!

Niche Academy is a resource that was created with librarians 
in mind. This database features tutorials and courses that 
librarians around the country have contributed to. 

The  goal  of  Niche  Academy  is  to  create  course-based 
resources that librarians can go to in order to learn more 
about a specific topic. The database features courses pulled from WebJunction, Niche Academy, the ND 
State Library, and libraries across the country. This will not function like a basic static database, but rather 
an ever-evolving one as courses are updated and added to it. Currently, this academy will make a great 
resource for in depth database tutorials for the databases that are seen on the State Library’s webpage.  
You can access this database on the State Library’s database page by clicking on the blue “Tutorials” button. 

Check out future issues of the Flickertale for more information on the features of this database and different 
ways it can be used.

FEBRUARY 2019

By Jessica Robinson

Romance readers know what they want and aren’t 
shy about debating the virtues of their selections. 
Join the debate this month by taking a chance on 
love with these standalone and series titles.

Amanda Bouchet brings two great tastes together 
with  the  first  in  her  science  fiction  romance 
series  Endeavor.  The  book  is  called  Nightchaser 
and  it’s  a  romance  on  the  run—in  space—when 
Captain Tess  Bailey  becomes  the  galaxy’s  number 
one fugitive, only to enlist the help of an arrogant 
stranger.  Sally Thorne’s  99  Percent  Mine  came  out 
at  the  end  of  January  and  explores  the  loyalty  
of  childhood  friends  and  perfect  first  loves  when 
Darcy Barrett sets out to seduce her twin brother’s 
best  friend.  Julie  Anne  Long’s  new  series,  The  
Palace  of  Rogues,  begins  with  Lady  Derring Takes  a 
Lover. When a headstrong young widow takes over 
her husband’s debt, she finds freedom in her new 
situation—a  freedom  that’s  challenged  by  a  naval 
hero  searching  for  smugglers.  Lorelei  James  goes 
after contemporary romance with I Want You Back, 
the  first  in  her  new  Want You  series.  Here,  Lucy 
Quade  is  enjoying  a  stable  single  life  in  the Twin 
Cities with her daughter when her ex-boyfriend—
former  NHL  star  Jaxson  Lund—shatters  her 
peace by moving back and demanding co-parenting  
rights.  The  Bride Test  by  Helen  Hoang  comes  out 
May  7  with  the  story  of  autistic  Khai  Diep  and 
the woman he’s not sure he’s capable of loving—
no matter how deeply she’s falling for him. Finally, 
we  end  the  standalones  with  Kristin  Rockaway’s 
How to Hack a Heartbreak, a timely contemporary  
romance with a woman coder at a prestigious start-
up who gets fed up with online dating and creates 
JerkAlert in her spare time, an overnight sensation 
that allows users to log harassers and attracts the 
attention of the only non-jerk at her company.

Now we move onto new entries in series fiction  
with  Miranda  Liasson’s  new  Angel  Falls  book,  The 
Way You  Love  Me,  centering  on  a  bored  attorney 
who tries to spice up her life with a writing class 
taught  by a  best-selling novelist who has no time  

for a talented student, no matter how beautiful she 
is. Devil’s Daughter is the fifth book in The Ravenels 
series  by  Lisa  Kleypas  and  features  a  romance 
for  West  Ravenel,  the  popular  wastrel-turned-
to 
responsible-businessman.  Here,  West  has 
overcome his past bad behavior when a beautiful 
young  widow  enters  his  life,  severely  prejudiced 
against  him  for  bullying  her  late  husband  when 
he  was  in  boarding  school.  J.R.  Ward  continues 
her  Black  Dagger  Brotherhood  series  in  April 
with  a  seventeenth  entry  called  The  Savior. This 
paranormal romance takes a traumatized vampire 
and  puts  him  in  the  path  of  a  grieving  scientist 
who  just  discovered  that  her  late  fiancé  had 
been  involved  in  the  horrific  experimentation  of 
supernatural creatures. Alyssa Cole continues her 
Reluctant Royals series with A Prince on Paper when 
disenchanted  romantic  Nya  Jerami  finds  herself 
entangled  in  a  complicated  media  ruse  with  the  
bad  boy  prince  of  Liechtienbourg,  a  ruse  that 
becomes  more  tangled  when  they  develop  real 
feelings for each other. In March, Christine Feehan 
releases  the  fifteenth  book  in  her  GhostWalkers 
series, Toxic Game. Here, two trained professionals 
find  love  at  the  exact  wrong  time  when  they’re 
infected with a deadly virus released by a terrorist 
group. The  two  must  wage  war  on  their  enemies 
in  a  mad  race  to  find  a  cure  and  save  their  new 
relationship. Finally, we end with Sherrilyn Kenyon’s 
final book in the Deadman’s Cross trilogy, At Death’s 
Door. Valynda Moore’s life goes from bad to worse 
when  she  dies  and  ends  up  in  the  body  of  a 
voodoo  doll.  She  has  a  chance  at  a  new  life  and 
love, but when her crew becomes embroiled in the 
malevolent  machinations  of  their  greatest  enemy, 
Valynda  has  more  problems  than  a  bad  case  of 
being mostly dead.

A  good  romance  puts  a  reader  in  a  great  mood, 
ready  to  spread  the  word  of  their  new  favorite. 
Hopefully, you’ll find some of those new favorites in 
2019’s fresh romance offerings. Next month, we’ll 
go from epic love to epic battles when we discuss 
comic books.

The Library Bill of Rights — first adopted in 1939 and last amended in 1980 — has been updated to include 
an article focused on the concept of ensuring privacy and confidentiality for library users.

The new article of the Library Bill of Rights, Article VII, states:

“All people, regardless of origin, age, background, or views, possess a right to privacy and confidentiality in 
their library use. Libraries should advocate for, educate about, and protect people’s privacy, safeguarding all 
library use data, including personally identifiable information.”

“Libraries  across  the  nation  now  have  the  support  needed  to  protect  and  fight  for  the  privacy  rights  of 
their  patrons,”  said  Erin  Berman,  chair  of  the  Intellectual  Freedom  Committee’s  Privacy  Subcommittee 
and  co-leader  of  the  working  group  that  drafted  the  new  article.  “They  may  use  the  privacy  article  
to update policies and practices, bringing the new article to governing bodies, vendors, funders and their 
patrons.”

Helen Adams, an IFC member and co-leader of the working group, commended the working group and 
those who contributed to the privacy article. She also noted the article’s significance to school libraries.

“With  the  addition  of  Article VII,  students  in  K-12  public  schools  are  promised  the  right  of  privacy  and 
confidentiality in their library use,” said Adams. “Adding the core values of privacy and confidentiality to one 
of the profession’s foundational documents places school librarians in a stronger position from which to 
advocate for and educate about library privacy for minors.”

The revision process began with a joint working group of the Intellectual Freedom Committee (IFC) and 
Privacy Subcommittee. The working group envisioned the article as an opportunity for libraries to reaffirm 
their  commitment  to  patron  privacy  for  library  users  of  all  ages.  ALA  Council  adopted  the  article  at  the 
Midwinter Meeting in Seattle.

During the revision process, the working group received valuable feedback from the library community. 
The  working  group  plans  to  incorporate  these  comments  into  its  next  project:  revising  “Privacy: 
An  Interpretation  of  the  Library  Bill  of  Rights.”  All  updated  intellectual  freedom  documents  will  be  
included in the 10th edition of the Intellectual Freedom Manual, scheduled to be published by ALA Editions 
in 2020.

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT: ZIPLINE DINOSAURS
Submitted by Abby Ebach

rying to spice up your STEAM programming? Young Houston Public Library patrons were challenged 
to  find  a  way  to  move  a  plastic  dinosaur  down  the  zipline  to  safety. They  were  given  simple  office 
supplies such as card stock, index cards, straw, pipe cleaners, craft sticks, Styrofoam cups, tape, paper 
clips, and binder clips.

  T

This  project  is  great  for  all  sorts  of  reasons—it’s  inexpensive,  it’s  trial-and-error,  and  it’s  fun!  This 
program  would  be  great  for  a  STEAM  program  for  middle  grade  students.  For  more  “STEAM  on

HISTORICAL LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR THE 
NORTH DAKOTA CONSTITUTION AND NORTH DAKOTA STATUTES
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

FEBRUARY 2019

   

Patrons  will  need  to  use  the  print  version  of  the 
North Dakota Century Code.

The  print  version  of  the  North  Dakota  Century 
Code contains both the Century Code statutes and 
the  North  Dakota  Constitution.  The  Century  Code 
statutes  are  in Volume  1A  through Volume  12. The 
North Dakota Constitution is in Volume 13A.

To find the dates of enactment and amendment, go 
to the Source section directly following the text of 
the specific statute or Section of the Constitution.

The  Source  section 
lists  the  original  date  of 
enactment  and  any  amendment  dates  of  each 
Section of the Constitution and each statute in the 
Century Code.

A  patron  should  always  check 
the  pocket 
supplement  for  any  updates  to  the  statute  or  
Section  of  the  Constitution  since  the  volume  was 
printed in hardcover.

Continued on pg. 11

SECOND, LOOK AT THE SOURCE SECTION AFTER THE TEXT 
OF THE LAW:

In  the  Source  section,  the  numbers  and  letters 
for  the  dates  of  enactment  and  any  amendment 
dates  generally  include  the  following  identifying 
information:
•	 S.L.  =  Session  Laws  of  North  Dakota.  Session 
Laws are published after each regular and special 
legislative session and contain the laws enacted 
or amended that session.

•	 Year  =  Year  of  the  North  Dakota  legislative 
session when the law was enacted or amended.

ch.  XXX  =  Chapter  Category.  Every  bill  
introduced in a legislative session is placed in a 
numbered  chapter  category  that  generally  fits 
the subject matter.

	 § X = Section. Every chapter category is divided 
into  sections.  Each  section  contains  the  text 
of  the  law  or  amendments  to  an  existing  law. 
Section numbering begins at 1.

•	

  •

This is the fifth in a series of articles that aim to take 
the  mystery  out  of  North  Dakota’s  legal  reference 
resources.

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past  issues  of  The  Flickertale.  Next  month’s  article  
will  get  into  more  detail  about  legal  research 
resources for North Dakota case law. 

WHAT IS HISTORICAL LEGAL RESEARCH?

Sometimes  a  patron  wants  to  know  what  the  law 
was  on  a  specific  date  or  timeframe,  or  how  a  law 
has changed over time. Historical primary sources of 
law, such as previous versions of the North Dakota 
Constitution and North Dakota Century Code, give 
the law in effect as of a past publication date.

For example:
•  A patron wants to know how and when a North 
Dakota Century Code section or a section of the 
North Dakota Constitution was amended.

•  A  patron  wants  to  know  what  the  criminal 
penalty  was  for  a  specific  type  of  crime  on  the 
date the judgment was entered by the court.

•  A  patron  wants  to  know  what  a  section  of  the 
North Dakota Constitution said on the date the 
North Dakota Supreme Court wrote an opinion 
interpreting what that section means.

Following are historical legal research resources for 
the  North  Dakota  Constitution  and  North  Dakota 
statutes that are free to use.

FIRST, FIND THE DATES OF ENACTMENT AND AMENDMENT:

The first step in historical legal research for the North 
Dakota  Constitution  and  North  Dakota  statutes, 
including the North Dakota Century Code, is to find 
the  dates  of  enactment  and  amendment  for  the 
specific section.

The  North  Dakota  Century  Code  available  at  the 
North  Dakota  Legislative  Branch  website  does 
not  list  dates  of  enactment  and  amendment  for  
the  North  Dakota  Constitution  or  North  Dakota 
Century Code.

library  services, 

For  example,  the  Source  section  for  North  Dakota 
Century  Code  Section  40-38-11,  relating  to  joint 
public 
lists  the  1965  date  of 
enactment and four later amendments in the 1971, 
1979, 1981 and 2005 Legislative Sessions:
• 

S.L. 1965, ch. 352 § 2; 1971, ch. 411, § 1; 1979, ch. 
550, § 6; 1981, ch. 418, § 4; 2005, ch. 348 § 1.

Suppose a patron wants the version of Section 40-
38-11  as  it  existed  in  1994. The  patron  would  look 
for the version that was amended during the 1981 
Legislative  Session,  which  is  listed  as  S.L.  1981,  ch. 
418, § 4 in the Source section. The 1981 version was 
in  effect  until  the  next  amendment  was  enacted 
during the 2005 Legislative Session.

THIRD, LOCATE THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE LAW:

There  are  two  legal  research  resources  for  viewing 
historical versions of the North Dakota Constitution 
and  North  Dakota  Century  Code:  1)  The  Session 
Laws  of  North  Dakota;  and  2)  Old  versions  of  the 
North Dakota statutes, including the North Dakota 
Century Code.

Session Laws of North Dakota:

The  Session  Laws  are  available  online  at  the  
North  Dakota  Legislative  Branch  website  of  
www.legis.nd.gov.  Session  Laws  are  available  from 
the  1862  Territory  of  North  Dakota  Session  Laws 
through the 2017 Session Laws.

The  Session  Laws  from  the  1862 Territory  of  North 
Dakota Session Laws through the 2017 Session Laws 
are also available in print at the Supreme Court Law 
Library in Bismarck.

Please  note  that  the  Session  Laws  show  only  the 
parts of a statute that were amended, but may not 
include the unchanged portions.

The patron using S.L. 1981, ch. 418, § 4 as a reference 
should  go  to  the  1981  Session  Laws,  then  Chapter 
418,  and  finally  Section  4  to  find  the  version  of 
Section 40-38-11 in effect in 1994.

Old Versions of the North Dakota Statutes:

Generally, old versions of North Dakota statutes that 
are available free of charge will be in print only. Due 
to  space  constraints,  few  libraries  keep  old  print 
versions  of  North  Dakota  statutes,  so  locating  a 
historical version may be difficult.

The Supreme Court Law Library in Bismarck has print 
versions of all of the old versions of North Dakota’s 
statutes from the territorial days through the 2017 
Legislative  Session.  The  Law  Library  also  has  the 
printed  pocket  supplements  for  the  North  Dakota 
Century Code from 1961 to 2017.

The  patron  will  need  to  determine  the  Volume 
of  the  North  Dakota  Century  Code  that  includes 
Title  40. The Title  is  the  first  set  of  numbers  in  the  
citation for Section 40-38-11. Currently, Title 40 is in 
Volume 8A.

Then, knowing from S.L. 1981, ch. 418, § 4 that the 
version the patron needs is from the 1981 Legislative 
Session, the patron will need to locate the 1981 print 
version of the North Dakota Century Code.

The 1981 version of Section 40-38-11 will be in one 
of two print resources: 1) A hardcover print volume, 
only if that volume was reprinted following the 1981 
Legislative Session; or 2) A pocket supplement that 
was tucked into the existing hardcover print volume 
following  the  1981  Legislative  session  because  the 
volume was not reprinted.
