Changes to the 
Flickertale Newsletter

The  Flickertale  newsletter  will  have  a  new  look  
after this issue!

he  columns  and  news  you  have  come  to  
expect  will  still  be  included  each  month,  but  the 
frequency  and  format  will  be  different.  Instead  of 
being  published  once  per  month,  new  issues  will  
be  released  every  Thursday.  This  will  cut  down  on  
the  length  of  the  Flickertale,  and  we  hope  it  will 
provide relevant news in a more timely fashion.

he  format  will  also  be  different.  The  newsletter  
will conveniently be right in the body of the e-mail  
so  you  will  no  longer  have  to  click  a  link  or  open  
an attachment.

f  you  have  any  questions  or  concerns,  contact  the 
State Library at 701-328-4622 or ndslpa@nd.gov.

Library Vision Grant Round

The  North  Dakota  State  Library,  in  partnership  with  the  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  
Council, is pleased to announce a Library Vision Grant round. There will be two grant opportunities: 
COVID-19  Response  and  Professional  Development.  Guidelines  and  the  scoring  rubric  will  be  
available  on  the  State  Library’s  website  next  week. The  application  will  be  completed  in  Counting 
Opinions. The grant round opens on October 1, and applications are due October 31. 

he  intent  of  the  COVID-19  Response  grant  is  to  enable  libraries  to  modify  services  and  programs  
to  minimize  the  impact  of  COVID-19. This  grant  round  is  similar  to  the  first  one  we  offered  earlier  
this year, but it also allows a library to purchase equipment to help with virtual programming. 

he  intent  of  the  Professional  Development  grant  is  to  assist  libraries  in  providing  professional 
development opportunities for their staff, either individually or collectively.

ou are encouraged to reach out to Library Development for assistance when writing a grant. These 
are competitive grants, and we encourage you to review the scoring rubric prior to grant submission. 

he  most  recent  version  of  Library  Vision  is  available  for  download  on  our  website.  If  you  would  
like  a  printed  copy  mailed  to  you,  please  contact  BreAnne  Meier  at  ndslpa@nd.gov  by  September  
30. Copies will be printed at that time and mailed to the library when we receive them.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

the  home 

The  Peru  Public  Library  talked  about  resources 
that  they’ve  added.  They  call  their  collection  
learning  
for  homeschoolers 
collection.  I  really  loved  this  title,  especially  
now, with so many kids learning remotely. 
  
One  of  the 
libraries  used  the  term  “valet 
service”  for  their  curbside  pickup.  Many  of  
the  people  attending  the  webinar,  including  
me,  commented  on  how  much  they  liked  
this  title,  and  I  would  be  surprised  if  we  
don’t see this term cropping up at other libraries.

hese  programs  and  resources  that  were 
shared  aren’t  brand  new  and  similar  programs 
are  being  offered  around  North  Dakota,  too.  
I  thought  it  might  be  helpful  to  share  ideas  
from  other  libraries  to  help  spark  an  idea  
of  ways  to  modify  your  own  programs.  As  I  
said,  one  of  the  best  things  I  appreciate  about 
libraries 
is  their  willingness  to  share  with 
each  other.  There  are  lots  of  opportunities  to 
participate  in  sharing  and  learning.  The  State 
Library  hosts  a  library  community  meeting  
every  week;  one  week  it’s  on  Tuesday,  and  
the  next  week  is  Thursday.  We  would  love 
to  have  more  members  join  us  each  week 
to  share  thoughts,  ask  questions,  and  learn  
from  each  other.  If  you  can’t  make  these 
meetings,  I  encourage  you  to  seek  out  other 
opportunities  to  connect  with  colleagues.  
If  you  decide  to  host  an  online  craft  meeting,  
be  sure  to  send  me  the  details  so  I  can  join  in  
if I’m able. 

  T

One  of  the  things  I  love  most  about  the  
library  community  is  how  readily  we  share 
ideas,  information,  and  resources.  I  recently 
attended  a  webinar  presented  by  the  Small  
and  Rural  Libraries  Roundtable  of  the  Illinois 
Library  Association.  The  panel  presentation 
included  library  directors  from  a  variety  of 
libraries  sharing  about  what  went  well  and 
what  was  a  challenge  with  responding  to 
libraries.  
re-opening 
COVID19  and 
Several  of  the  librarians  shared  some  very 
personal  struggles  that  they’ve  had  during  
the pandemic, including panic attacks, anxiety, 
tension,  and  depression.  They  also  shared  
what  went  well  for  their 
in  their  
response  to  the  pandemic.  These  included 
connecting  with  the  community  in  new  ways, 
switching  to  virtual  programs,  and  taking 
advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  do  inventory, 
weeding, and cleaning the library.

libraries 

their 

library  used 

The  libraries  shared  a  variety  of  their  most 
successful  virtual  programs.  One  of 
the 
most  popular  programs  that  several  libraries  
discussed  was  a  local  history  program.  There 
were  several  different  takes  on  this  idea,  but 
one  that  I  really  liked  was  called  “Tales  from  
the  Archives.”  The 
it  as  an  
opportunity  to  highlight  items  in  their  local 
history  collection  as  well  as  to  partner  with  
the local museum. 
  
Another  popular  topic  was  crafting.  Programs 
included  a  virtual  quilting  show  and  online 
scrapbooking  as  well  as  “take  and  make” 
craft  kits  similar  to  what  many  North  Dakota  
libraries  are  offering.  Storywalks  and  a  virtual 
garden tour rounded out the programs.

YouTube Video Of The Month: 
Summer Summit Playlist

In  August,  the  State  Library  held  the  annual  Summer  
Summit  workshop.  Since  it  was  virtual  this  year,  we  were  
able  to  record  each  of  the  presentations  and  save  them  to  
a  playlist  on YouTube. You  can  watch  all  of  them  in  order  or  
just  pick  the  ones  you  are  most 
in.  Each  
presentation includes their question and answer section and 
has  the  presenter’s  information  in  case  you  have  any  follow-
up  questions.  These  presentations  range  from  30  minutes  
to  40  minutes  and  cover  topics  of  interest  to  any  librarian  
in the state.

Public Library Infographics

The  North  Dakota  State  Library  is  happy  to  provide  a  basic  infographic  based  on  the  numbers  
you  submitted  for  the  Public  Library  Survey  Annual  Report.  These  infographics  will  include  the  
number  of  visits  to  your  library,  registered  users,  items,  wireless  sessions,  programs,  program  
attendees, circulations, etc.

If you are interested in receiving a custom infographic, please send an e-mail to ndslpa@nd.gov.

Course of the Month: 
Homeschooling Category

here  are  many  different  categories,  but  one  that  would  
be  of  use  to  many  parents  in  your  community  right  now  
is  the  Homeschool  Category.  This  category  offers  courses 
on  different  subjects,  including  Algebra  101  and  American 
Government,  which  can  be  used  to  supplement  a  student’s  education.  Each  course  comes  with  a  
preset  amount  of  lessons  and  assignments  that  will  need  to  be  completed  before  the  user  can  get 
a  certificate  of  completion.  They  also  tell  the  user  right  up  front  how  long  each  course  should  take  
and what each lesson involves. 

he  Homeschooling  Category  will  work  well  for  the  local  homeschool  association,  members  of  the 
community  who  decided  to  try  homeschooling,  or  for  students  who  need  some  extra  classes  in  a  
subject area.

If you have any questions, please e-mail us at ndsltrain@nd.gov.

It  is  times  like  these  that  there  will  be  a  larger  need  from  
libraries  around  the  state  to  utilize  their  online  resources.  
Therefore,  we  decided  to  not  give  you  a  specific  course  
this  month,  but  rather  to  direct  you  to  the  use  of  the 
predesigned categories that Universal Class offers.

There  are  some  great  books  to  talk  about  this  
month  so  let’s  skip  the  preamble  and  go  right  
into  some  of  2020’s  best  and  upcoming  middle-
grade titles.

e’ll  kick  off  the  recs  with  a  debut  title  from  
Jennifer  Orr,  a  former  elementary  school  librarian. 
Orr  takes  us  to  summer  camp  with  Rating  Your 
Bunkmates  and  Other  Camp  Crimes,  a  story  about  
a  budding  anthropologist  named  Abigail  who  
tries  to  use  her  favorite  research  methods  at  a 
sleepaway camp in order to make new friends.

he  Lonely  Heart  of  Maybelle  Lane  by  Kate 
O’Shaughnessy 
is  about  complicated  families, 
the  ones  you’re  born  into  and  the  ones  you  
make.  Maybelle  Lane  loves  collecting  unusual 
sounds,  but  the  sound  of  her  absentee  father’s  
voice  on  his  radio  show  is  her  favorite.  When  
her  dad  announces  a  singing  contest  in  Nashville, 
Maybelle  goes  on  a  road  trip  with  her  stern  
neighbor and a neighborhood bully to see him.

nne Blankman’s The Blackbird Girls is set in 1980s 
Russia  and  in  Ukraine  during  WWII.  In  the  1980s 
segments,  two  girls  are  sent  away  from  home  
when  the  nuclear  power  plant  in  their  town— 
called  Chernobyl—explodes.  They  stay  with  one  
of  the  girl’s  grandmothers  and  learn  the  story  of 
when  she  also  had  to  flee  from  her  home  during  
the  1940s  as  her  Jewish  family  debated  if  they  
would  be  in  more  danger  moving  to  Russia  or 
staying in Ukraine when the Germans arrived.

he  Only  Black  Girls  in  Town  by  Brand  Colbert 
explores  issues  of  isolation  and  friendship  in  a  
small  California  town.  Easy-going  surfer  girl  
Alberta 
is  excited  when  another  black  family  
moves  into  her  tiny  beach  town.  She  assumes  
she’ll  be  best  friends  with  Brooklyn-born  Edie  
right  away,  but  Edie  misses  her  big  city  life.  
Alberta  and  Edie  aren’t  sure  if  they’re  ever  going  
to  connect  until  they  find  a  box  of  mysterious

Rethinking Libraries in the Wake of Protests 
and the Pandemic (Publishers Weekly) 
Tuesday, September 22 (10:00 AM–11:00 AM CDT)  

Register: https://bit.ly/2ZBCb78
 

”The crises we face today—in public health, in our economy, and in confronting the structural racism in  
our  society—demand  that  we  rethink  everything,”  wrote  R.  David  Lankes  in  a  recent  Publishers  
Weekly  column.  “Including  what  we’ve  always  considered  virtuous  institutions,  like  libraries,  schools,  
and publishers.”

We’ve  all  seen  the  statements  of  solidarity  from  various  institutions  following  the  death  of  George  
Floyd  at  the  hands  of  police  in  May.  But  what  do  these  statements  mean  in  practice?  How  do  libraries  
back  up  their  words  with  actions?  And  how  do  libraries  pursue  change  in  the  midst  of  a  public  health  
crisis and the economic and social disruption wrought by the pandemic?

In  this  webinar,  Lankes  and  Nicole  A.  Cooke,  authors,  educators  and  colleagues  at  the  University  of  
South  Carolina,  will  take  stock  of  this  unprecedented  cultural  moment  and  kick  off  a  discussion  on  
how  libraries  can  proceed  on  the  path  to  becoming  the  anti-racist,  truly  equitable  institutions  our  
society needs.

combination of their first, middle, and last names.

Changing  a  name  is  a  frequently  requested  legal 
research  topic  by  self-represented  patrons  of  the 
North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library  and  
North Dakota Legal Self Help Center.

he following are legal research and other resources 
for changing a name in North Dakota.

NAME CHANGE PROCESS

The  rest  of  this  article  focuses  on  bringing  a

stand-alone  name  change  case 
Dakota  state  district  court.  This 
is  the  most  
requested  name  change  information  at  the  ND 
Legal Self Help Center.

Petitioner 
in  a  Stand-Alone  Name  Change  
Case:  The  Petitioner  is  the  adult  (18  years  or  
older)  asking  a  North  Dakota  state  district  court 
to  change  their  name  or  the  name  of  their  minor 
child  (under  18  years  old). The  Petitioner  must  be 
a  resident  of  North  Dakota  for  at  least  6  months  
and  either  a  U.S.  citizen  or  a  U.S.  permanent 
resident  alien.  The  minor  child  must  also  meet  
these residency requirements.

their  North  Dakota  county  newspaper  of

child’s  name,  the  Petitioner  must  also  publish 
notice 
in  the  county  newspaper  where  the  
minor  child’s  non-custodial  parent  lives.  (A  non-
custodial  parent  is  a  parent  with  less  than  50%  of 
residential responsibility.)

Any  person  who  disagrees,  or  opposes,  the  name 
change  has  30  days  from  the  first  date  the  notice 
is  published  to  serve  a  written  document  on  the 
Petitioner explaining why they object.

North  Dakota  law  allows  for  only  two  reasons 
to  skip,  or  waive,  the  publication  step:  1)  The  
Petitioner  is  only  changing  their,  or  their  minor 
child’s,  first  or  middle  name;  or  2)  The  Petitioner,  
or their minor child, is a victim of domestic violence.

WHAT ARE THE WAYS TO CHANGE A NAME IN 
NORTH DAKOTA?

There  are  four  ways  for  an  individual  to  change 
their  name  in  North  Dakota.  Three  of  the  four  
ways require a civil court process.

Marriage  License/Certificate:  An  individual’s  last 
name  doesn’t  automatically  change  when  they  
in  North  Dakota.  One  or  both  
get  married 
individuals  can  choose  a  new  last  name  as  part  of 
the  marriage  license  process. They’re  not  required 
to have the same last name.

  S

hen  applying  for  a  marriage  license  in  North 
Dakota,  each  individual  who  wishes  to  change  
their  last  name  writes  the  new  last  name  in  the  
space  provided  on 
license  
application.  After  the  marriage  is  solemnized  and 
the  two  witnesses  to  the  marriage  ceremony  sign 
the  marriage  certificate,  the  marriage  certificate  is 
proof of the name change.

the  marriage 

Divorce:  Either  or  both  spouses  may  change  
their  name  as  part  of  their  divorce  case  in  the  
North  Dakota  state  district  court.  As 
long  as  
the  final  divorce  judgment/decree  in  the  case 
includes  the  name  change,  the  judgment/decree  
is proof of the name change.

Annulment:  Either  or  both  spouses  may  change 
their  name  as  part  of  their  annulment  case  in  the 
North  Dakota  state  district  court.  As  long  as  the  
final  annulment  order/judgment 
in  the  case  
includes  the  name  change,  the  order/judgment  is 
proof of the name change.

individuals  to  bring  a  stand-alone  case  in  North 
Dakota  to  change  their  name,  or  their  minor

by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  this  is  not  
the case.

Step  Four:  the  judge  decides  whether  to  grant  
the  name  change.    An  in-person  hearing  isn’t 
required  for  the  judge  to  make  a  decision  on  
whether  to  grant  the  name  change.  If  the  judge 
makes  the  decision  based  on  the  documents  filed 
in  the  case,  the  Petitioner  and  any  people  who 
objected  in  writing  will  receive  the  judge’s  order  
by mail.

f  the  judge  decides  a  hearing  is  necessary,  the 
Petitioner  and  any  people  who  objected 
in  
writing  will  receive  notice  of  the  hearing  date  and 
time  by  mail.  The  Petitioner  must  be  prepared 
to  prove  that  everything  they  included  in  their  
petition,  and  filed 
is  true  and  
accurate.  Following  the 
in-person  hearing,  the 
judge’s  order  is  mailed  to  the  Petitioner  and  any 
people who objected in writing.

Step  Two 
(Publication  Complete):  30  days  
after the first publication in the newspaper, the 
Petitioner  files  their  name  change  paperwork  
with  the  court.  The  Petitioner  must  file  a 
petition,  which  explains  how  they  meet  the  legal 
requirements  for  a  name  change  and  the  name  
they  want  the  North  Dakota  state  district  court  
to  grant.  The  Petitioner  must  also  file  a  copy  of 
the  notice  they  published  in  the  newspaper(s), 
the  affidavit  of  publication  they  received  from  
the  newspaper(s),  and  copies  of  all  objections  
they received.

Step  Two  (No  Publication):  If  the  Petitioner  
wants  to  ask  the  court  to  skip,  or  waive,  the 
publication  step,  the  Petitioner  must  file  a  
petition 
to  skip  
publication  and  why.  The  petition  must  also  
explain  how  they  meet  the  legal  requirements  
for  a  name  change  and  the  name  they  want  the 
court to grant.

includes  a  request 

that 

f  the  Petitioner  wants  to  skip  publication  because  
of  domestic  violence,  the  Petitioner  may  also 
file  copies  of  documentation  that  the  Petitioner  
believes  will  show  the  court  they,  or  the  minor  
child, are a victim of domestic violence.

f  the  judge  assigned  to  the  name  change  case 
decides  the  Petitioner  can’t  skip  the  publication 
step,  the  Petitioner  must  complete  Step  One  
before their name change case can move forward.

the  
Step  Three: 
Petitioner,  or  the  minor  child,  to  get  a  criminal 
history record check. North Dakota name change 
law allows the judge assigned to the name change 
case to require the Petitioner, or the minor child, to 
obtain a criminal history record check. If the judge 
requires  a  criminal  history  record  check,  the  name 
change  case  won’t  move  forward  until  the  results 
are filed with the court. 

  criminal  history  doesn’t  automatically  disqualify 
the  Petitioner,  or  the  minor  child,  from  getting 
their  name  changed.  However,  North  Dakota  law 
presumes  that  a  Petitioner,  or  minor  child,  with  a 
felony  conviction  is  making  their  name  change 
request in bad faith, to defraud or mislead, to cause 
injury  to  an  individual,  or  to  compromise  public 
safety.  The  Petitioner  must  prove  to  the  judge

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
