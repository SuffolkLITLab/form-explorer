 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

Recently,  NDSL  had  the  honor  of  hosting  the 
Chief	Officers	of	State	Library	Agencies	(COSLA)	
in Bismarck. COSLA is the national association 
for  state  librarians.  We  had  forty-four  states 
plus  one  territory  represented  as  well  as 
vendors, speakers, and sponsors totaling over 
seventy-five people. State Library staff assisted 
with  the  registration  desk  at  the  hotel,  tours 
of  the  state  library,  taking  the  group  picture 
at  the  opening  reception,  a  presentation 
during  the  meeting  as  well  as  lots  of  behind 
the scenes logistics. I am blessed to work with 
such a helpful staff. 

This  was  the  first  visit  to  North  Dakota  for 
many of the attendees. Breakfast and lunches 
were at the hotel, but the two evening meals 
were at restaurants in Bismarck. My colleagues 
raved  about  the  food  at  the  restaurants  we 
selected and several people made comments 
like “this  wasn’t  what  I  expected  from  North 
Dakota”.  One  state  librarian  told  me  that  we 
had changed people’s impressions of the state. 
I shared that with the chefs and the owner of 
the restaurant we were at and they were very 
pleased about the compliment. 

many instances of North Dakota hospitality at 
the conference that I’ve just taken for granted. 
It may be more accurate to call it Midwestern 
hospitality,  but  whatever  we  call  it,  it’s  a 
wonderful way to live. 

Our  guests  were  delighted  with  the  little 
things  that  we  did  to  help  them,  both  at 
COSLA  and  at  NDLA.  I  think  it’s  similar  to  the 
way  that  our  libraries  delight  patrons  when 
they  do  the  unexpected  little  things  that  we, 
as  librarians,  take  for  granted,  especially  in 
small  and  rural  libraries. There  was  recently  a 
thread on the Association for Rural and Small 
Libraries	(ARSL)	maillist	about	different	things	
that  libraries  have  done  to  go  above  and 
beyond  the  expected  service.  Some  of  them 
were truly amazing stories that really showed 
how  libraries  are  truly  the  center  of  the 
community and the one that connects the dots 
for  so  many  people. The  stories  ranged  from 
connecting  childhood  friends  that  had  lost 
touch  to  returning  a  missing  family  heirloom 
to  making  a  patron  suffering  from  dementia 
more comfortable by allowing her service dog 
to accompany her in the library. 

My  husband  and  my  sister-in-law  were  put 
into  service  to  help  shuttle  people  to  and 
from  the  State  Library  and  from  our  opening 
reception  at  the  Heritage  Center  back  to  the 
hotel. People commented about how unusual 
it was that my sister-in-law would do this, and 
I  just  kept  shrugging  because  it  didn’t  really 
seem that unusual to me. I didn’t realize that it 
was the North Dakota way though until I went 
to the NDLA conference later in the same week 
when  Kerri  Boetcher’s  husband,  Brandon, 
shuttled one of the keynote speakers from the 
airport  to  the  convention  hotel.  I  witnessed 

We  in  the  library  profession  go  above  and 
beyond  all  the  time  without  even  realizing 
that  we’re  doing  it.  I  am  so  thankful  to  be 
working  in  a  profession  that  values  customer 
service  and  helping  people  from  all  walks  of 
life with the little and big things. Please share 
your stories with me about the ways that your 
library  has  impacted  patrons  by  going  above 
and beyond. Thank you for all that you do for 
the  patrons  that  you  serve,  both  local  and 
guests,  and  for  allowing  the  North  Dakota 
State  Library  to  serve  you  and  the  citizens  of 
our wonderful state.

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

DIGITAL HORIZONS

It’s Family Heritage Month,  and  there is no better way to  discover more about  your  North  Dakota  roots 
than on Digital Horizons. Digital Horizons is the online archive for the North Dakota State Library and other 
institutions throughout the region. The goal of the archive is to promote the unique history of the area. 

The  two  most  popular  collections  that  the  North  Dakota  State  Library  contributes  to  that  would  help 
with heritage studies are the North Dakota Memories and the County & Town Histories collections. Both  
collections  are  put  together  from  communities  around  the  state.  North  Dakota  Memories  is  primarily 
photographs  and  documents  that  residents  have  asked  us  to  digitize  and  County  &  Town  Histories    is 
comprised of books from town anniversaries and some churches. All of the collections on Digital Horizons 
are good for research, but these two can make that research more personal. 

If you want to learn more about Digital Horizons or have any questions, please e-mail ndsltrain@nd.gov.

viewers to send in comments about a movie and have them pop up on the screen in real time. Library 
viewings in different locations can all participate and interact together to allow for a more immersive 
experience, as well. MuVchat has the option to run every message through a filtering algorithm or to 
be approved by a moderator before being posted. 

Pricing and other information can be found online at www.muvchat.com.

International  Observe 
the  Moon 
Night  is  an  annual,  worldwide  public 
event that encourages observation and 
appreciation of the Moon. Everyone on 
Earth  is  invited  to  observe  and  learn 
about the Moon together.

Since  this  event  takes  place  when  the 
Moon  is  around  its  first  quarter,  it 
should be visible in the afternoon and 
evening, making it convenient for most 
people to participate.

Do  you  plan  to  observe  the  Moon 
for  International  Observe  the  Moon 
Night? We invite you to send pictures 
of your event to ndslpa@nd.gov.

NORTH DAKOTA TALKING BOOK LIBRARY

Is  poor  eyesight  spoiling  your  love  of  reading  or  that  of  someone  you  know?  The  North  Dakota  State  
Library has a program that can speak to that problem. It’s called Talking Books. Through the National Library 
Service, any North Dakota citizen with a visual or physical impairment or reading disability is eligible for 
talking books.

There  is  no  charge  for  this  service.  All  materials,  including  players,  talking  books  and  accessories,  are 
mailed  to  the  patron  at  no  charge,  and  individuals  return  all  materials  via  the  US  Postal  Service’s “Free  
Matter  for  the  Blind  and  Physically  Handicapped”  privilege.  Other  equipment  available  to  patrons  are 
headphones, a high-volume player, remote control, pillow speaker and a breath switch.

Talking Books allows patrons to receive multiple titles on a cartridge that is created specifically for them. 
When  returned,  the  cartridge  is  erased  and  reused.  Patrons  have  access  to  over  100,000  books  in  the 
collection, with no waiting lists. Plus, they have the option to request all the books in a particular series be 
put	in	order	on	a	single	cartridge	(space	permitting).

There  are  a  couple  of  other  ways  to  receive  books  as  well.  Patrons  may  download  digital  talking  books  
and	magazines	from	Braille	and	Audio	Reading	Download	(BARD)	on	to	their	machine	using	their	computer.	
This  is  a  web-based  service  that  provides  access  to  thousands  of  e-braille  and  encrypted  talking  books, 
magazines, and music appreciation materials. Another option is the BARD Mobile app, which allows patrons 
to download braille and audio materials onto their iOS or Android devices. Many of the materials available 
in hard-copy braille and digital cartridges are also available for download in braille and audio formats.

Qualifying  patrons  can  also  receive  large  print  books  from  the  state  library. The  library  has  8,074  large  
print titles available. Like the cartridges, the library can mail these books via “Free Matter for the Blind and 
Physically Handicapped” to the patron.

The ND Talking Book Library has approximately 1,577 patrons, ranging in age from 4 to 112 years old. This  
service  has  approximately  104,802  titles  available  for  our  patrons,  fiction  and  non-fiction,  including 
everything from best sellers and westerns to romance and history. It would take a patron 87 continuous 
years  to  read  all  of  the  NLS  books.  It  has  been  said  that  a  non-sighted  person  reads  an  average  of  7  
times more books than a sighted individual. One ND Talking Book Library patron has read 6,100 books!

If you have any questions, please contact the North Dakota State Talking Book Library at 1-800-843-9948 or 
e-mail tbooks@nd.gov. 

For more information, visit the library website at http://library.nd.gov/talkingbooks.html.

ALA ADVOCACY BOOTCAMP
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Jamie LaRue and Marci Merola from ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom and Office for Library Advocacy 
hosted  a  pre-conference  session  at  NDLA.  During  their  sessions,  they  discussed  the  steps  of  doing  a 
community interview. A community interview allows you to discuss the big issues your community is 
facing in the next 1–2 years and how the library can help meet the community’s needs. 

1. Brainstorm community leaders; think about different groups such as local businesses, student groups, 
Lions  clubs  and  other  civic  groups,  educational  groups,  elected  leaders,  faith  organizations  and  
non-profits. 

2. Meet the leaders in your community in their own space and not in the library. This sets the tone of the 

interview to highlight what they are doing in the community.

3. Conduct  the  interview  by  asking  simple  questions  and  listening  to  the  answers.  This  is  not  a 
time  to  ask  what  they  can  do  for  the  library;  instead,  ask  them  for  their  knowledge  about  the  
community’s needs.

4. Have staff analyze the responses to all of the interviews. Were there common themes and patterns?

5. Debrief by looking at the list of issues and seeing what groups are working on these issues in the 
community. See if there are ones that multiple groups are already working on and if some issues are 
not being addressed.

6. Select a project that people aren’t already working on. Make sure that this project aligns with the 
library’s strategic plan or mission statement and values. This is the project that the library will dedicate 
itself to.

7. Budget  and plan for the project. This project  shouldn’t  be  a one-time  program. The  library should 
budget both its time and money towards filling the community’s long-term needs. Map out a plan to 
fill this need with the library and board of directors.

8. Follow your plan and work to fill this need. Make sure to market the programs or efforts the library is 

making as well as showing how you succeeded.

OCTOBER 2018

By Jessica Robinson

As  Sheriff  Brackett  says  in  John  Carpenter’s 
seminal  horror  movie  Halloween, 
“It’s  
Halloween;  I  guess  everyone’s  entitled  to  one 
good  scare.” Thankfully,  we  don’t  have  to  wait 
until  the  big  day  to  enjoy  the  spooks  of  the 
season.  Find  a  secluded  corner  in  your  house, 
crack  open  one  of  these  2018  releases,  and 
ignore  that  creaking  sound  on  the  stairs.  It’s 
nothing…right?

is  a  
The  line  between  thriller  and  horror 
thin one, as the debates over the classification 
of The Silence of the Lambs prove. However, it’s 
undeniable  that  these  thrillers  are  horrifying 
and will certainly do their part to chill a reader’s 
bones.  Zoje  Stage’s  Baby  Teeth  brings  The  Bad 
Seed  into  the  21st  century  with  little  Hanna, 
whose  sweetness  might  be  a  front  for  good 
old-fashioned sociopathy. A camp is the classic 
horror  movie  setting  of  Riley  Sager’s  The  Last 
Time I Lied, where artist Emma Davis returns as 
painting  instructor  and  attempts  to  discover 
what happened when her friends disappeared 
years ago. The comparisons between A.J. Finn’s 
The Woman in the Window and Hitchcock’s Rear 
Window are unmistakable but the agoraphobic, 
alcoholic  heroine  of  Finn’s  thriller  is  no  James 
Stewart, and her reliability comes into question 
even  with  the  readers  when  she  witnesses 
something shocking concerning the nice family 
next door. 

Now we move into other types of genre-bending 
horror  with  Joe  Hart’s  spooky  science-fiction 
novel Obscura. An aggressive form of dementia 
plagues  the  near-future  and  Dr.  Gillian  Ryan 
travels to a remote space station to investigate 
an isolated group of astronauts suffering from  
illness,  with  violent  results.  The  
a  similar 
marriage  of  the  historical  novel  and  horror 

is  a  winning  combination  and  both  Robert 
McCammon’s  The  Listener  and  Laird  Hunt’s  In 
the  House  in  the  Dark  of  the  Woods  show  how 
terrifying  that  relationship  can  be.  Robert 
McCammon  turns  to  the  Great  Depression  as  
his  backdrop  and  features  a  young  black  man 
with  an  unusual  talent  for  hearing  the  things 
people aren’t saying, which puts him in conflict 
with  some  dangerous  people  when  he  hears 
a  child’s  internal  cry  for  help.  Meanwhile  Laird 
Hunt  goes  all  the  way  back  to  the  colonial  
days  of  New  England  and  follows  a  proper 
Puritan  woman  who  gets  lost  in  the  woods, 
only to find herself in a strange world of magic  
and unspeakable evil.

Finally,  we  land  on  more  traditional  horror, 
stories of monsters and ghosts and everything 
else  that  goes  bump 
in  the  night.  Peter 
Stenson’s Thirty-Seven concerns a more human 
type  of  monster  as  it  follows  a  young  man 
trying  to  heal  after  belonging  to  a  brutal  cult, 
only  to  meet  with  people  who  are  drawn  to 
its  survivalist  philosophy.  In  Ben  Dolnick’s  The  
Ghost  Notebooks,  a  newly  engaged  couple 
find  their  devotion  tested  when  they  agree  to 
become  the  live-in  caretakers  of  crumbling 
museum, an old historic house that whispers to 
the woman before she goes missing altogether. 
Finally,  Damien  Angelica  Walters  presents  a 
collection of surreal and horrific short stories in 
Cry Your Way Home, bite-sized and perfect for a 
night in front of the fire.

Hopefully,  your  October  will  be  filled  with 
exactly the right amount of scares to clear away 
the cobwebs in your head because next month 
we’ll put on our sleuthing hats and solve some 
of the best mysteries of 2018.

NORTH DAKOTA LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES IN A NUTSHELL 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

   

 

 

All  over  the  country,  and  in  North  Dakota,  more  
and  more  people  are  looking  for  answers  to  their 
legal  questions  at  their  local  public  and  academic 
libraries.  Providing  reference  assistance  for  legal 
questions  can  be  daunting,  especially  when  legal 
research isn’t a familiar topic.

This  is  the  first  in  a  series  of  Flickertale  articles 
that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s  
legal  reference  resources.  This  first  article  is  a  
nutshell overview of North Dakota’s legal research 
resources and where to find them free of charge.

Future  articles  will  get  into  more  detail  about 
individual North Dakota legal research resources.

www.ndcourts.gov/Research  is  a  convenient  and 
free online access point for the North Dakota legal 
research resources in this article.

North Dakota Constitution:

This  is  North  Dakota’s  founding  document  that 
explains the three branches of government and the 
authority  each  branch  has  to  create  new  law. The 
laws created by each of the three branches cannot 
conflict with the constitution.

The  North  Dakota  Constitution  is  available  online 
and in print.

If  your  library  has  the  print  version  of  the  North 
Dakota  Century  Code,  Volume  13A  contains  the 
North	Dakota	Constitution.	(If	your	print	version	is	
out  of  date,  the  current  version  is  available  at  the  
link	above.)

North Dakota Century Code – Legislative Branch:

The North Dakota Century Code contains the laws, 
also called statutes, which are enacted by the North 
Dakota State Legislative Assembly.

The North Dakota Century Code is available online 
and in print.

If  your  library  has  the  print  version  of  the  North 
Dakota  Century  Code,  Volumes  1A  through  12 
contain	 the	 North	 Dakota	 Century	 Code.	 (If	 your	

print  version  is  out  of  date,  the  current  version  is 
available	at	the	research	link	above.)

Two  reference  guides  to  the  numbers  and  letters 
that  make  up  the  citation  to  specific  parts  of  
the  Century  Code  are  available  at  www.ndcourts.
gov/ndlshc by clicking on the Rules and Laws link.

The  General  Index  to  the  North  Dakota  Century 
Code  is  a  useful  reference  resource.  However,  the  
General  Index  is  only  available  with  the  print 
version  of  the  Century  Code. The  General  Index  is 
not available online.

Administrative Code – Executive Branch:

When the North Dakota State Legislative Assembly 
creates  an  agency,  the  statute  that  creates  the 
agency  gives  the  broad  boundaries  of  what  the 
agency  can  do.  The  agency  enacts  regulations 
to  pin  down  the  specifics.  The  regulations  form  
the North Dakota Administrative Code.

The North Dakota Administrative Code is available 
longer 
online.  The  Administrative  Code 
available in print.

is  no 

Case Law – Judicial Branch:

When a final decision of a case is appealed from a 
North  Dakota  District  Court  to  the  North  Dakota 
Supreme  Court,  the  Supreme  Court  writes  their 
opinion  to  explain  how  and  why  they  interpreted 
the  laws  or  rules  to  decide  the  appeal  the  way  
they  did.  The  opinions  are  case  law  and  are  
followed  by  North  Dakota  state  courts  deciding 
later cases with similar facts and issues.

Case  law,  also  called  opinions,  is  available  online 
and in print.

North  Dakota’s  case  law  print  resources  will  be 
explained  more  thoroughly  in  a  future  article.  In  
the  meantime,  a  handy  print  resource  are  the 
snapshots  of  case  law  following  the  text  of  a  
statute  in  the  print  version  of  the  North  Dakota 
Century Code.

Court Procedural Rules – Judicial Branch:

The North Dakota Supreme Court adopts procedural rules that govern how a civil or criminal matter makes 
its way to court and how the dispute is conducted. Court rules cover procedures such as when a case starts, 
service of documents in the case, how requests are made to the court, and many other procedural issues.

The North Dakota Court Procedural Rules are available online and in print.

If  your  library  has  the  print  version  of  the  North  Dakota  Century  Code,  the  volume  entitled  Court  Rules 
Annotated	contains	the	court	procedural	rules.	(If	your	print	version	is	out	of	date,	the	current	version	is	
available	at	the	link	on	the	previous	page.)

Pattern Jury Instructions:

In criminal actions and in the civil actions where jury trials are permitted and requested, the judge instructs 
the jury concerning the law involved in the action. North Dakota, like many states, develops pattern jury 
instructions  that  can  be  used  in  criminal  and  civil  actions. The  pattern  jury  instructions  usually  include 
references to applicable statutes and case law and an outline of the elements that must be proven.

North Dakota Pattern Jury Instructions are available online at www.ndcourts.gov/ndlshc by clicking on the 
Pattern Jury Instructions link. Pattern Jury Instructions are no longer available in print.

Pointing a Patron to North Dakota Legal Research Resources:

Future Flickertale articles will include tips on referring patrons to specific legal reference resources. In the 
meantime, when a patron has a legal question, any of the following are handy North Dakota legal reference 
resources to provide.

If  your  library  has  access  to  the  General  Index  to  the  North  Dakota  Century  Code  in  print,  the  
statutes, North Dakota Constitution and court procedural rules are all included in the index. Even a recently 
out  of  date  General  Index  can  be  useful  to  patrons  looking  for  the  law  on  a  subject  or  related  to  their 
circumstances.

The  North  Dakota  Legal  Self  Help  Center  website  provides  the  Commonly  Referenced  North  Dakota 
Statutes	and	Court	Rules	(Civil	Matters	Only)	guide.	This	resource	is	available	at	www.ndcourts.gov/ndlshc 
by clicking on the Rules and Laws link.

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center website also provides the Guide to a Civil Action. This guide gives 
the basic start to finish process for civil actions in North Dakota state district court. This resource is available 
at www.ndcourts.gov/ndlshc by clicking on the Guide to Civil Action link.

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH: 
ND STATE DOCS - WHAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT THE 
LIBRARY BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK

In this month’s YouTube video we are highlighting a video 
from our State Documents collection. This video was done 
by  the  Chester  Fritz  Library  at  the  University  of  North 
Dakota and it is everything you needed to know about the 
library but couldn’t ask. This video was done in the style of 
a  horror  film  to  show  that  many  students  find  the  library 
scary. It is a perfect video for this time of the year!

TACKLING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AT NDLA
Submitted by Angie Houser

I received the opportunity to attend the annual conference of the North Dakota Library Association 
this year, and while there, I attended a session presented by librarians from the Minot Public Library 
on closing the digital divide. When many librarians discuss the issue of the digital divide, we look at  
it as getting technology in the hands of those who don’t have it or making technology accessible to 
those without. 

The  Minot  Public  Library  has  tackled  the  other  side  of  the  divide.  This  is  when  someone  
has technology such as a laptop or tablet but doesn’t know how to use it. They do personalized, one-
on-one sessions with patrons about their device or whatever issue they would like to cover. They do 
everything from fixing a computer to teaching how to use a laptop to setting up an email. They don’t 
limit the scope of these lessons. However, the patron must have a library card. 

This type of training is essential to all ages and should be offered in all communities. Good job Minot 
Public Library!
