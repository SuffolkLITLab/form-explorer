www.ndcourts/legal-self-helpPage 4 of 15Ans Brief Mot PRR/Rev. Aug 2020LAW AND ARGUMENT 

9.

North Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-06.6 allows a court to consider modification

of primary residential responsibility after two years from the date of entry of the order 

establishing primary residential responsibility, or after two years from the date of entry of the 

order on a motion to modify primary residential responsibility.  North Dakota Century Code 

Section 14-09-06.6 allows a court to consider modification of primary residential responsibility 

if the parenting plan includes a time frame earlier than two years.  

10.

(Choose one)

 It has been two years or more since the Judgment/___________ Amended

Judgment was entered on _________________________, ______ (date). 

 It has not been two years or more since the Judgment/___________ Amended

Judgment was entered, paragraph ______ of the Judgment/___________ Amended 

Judgment allows/does not allow (choose one) modification before two years when 

(state event/ circumstances):   

(Complete if you think the Judgment does not allow modification:) The event or 

circumstance has not occurred as follows:  

www.ndcourts/legal-self-helpPage 5 of 15Ans Brief Mot PRR/Rev. Aug 202011.

Before a court will grant a full, in-person evidentiary hearing, the party requesting

modification must show, in writing, (I) that there is a significant or material change in 

circumstances that justifies modification of primary residential responsibility, and (II) that 

modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the children. 

I: Plaintiff/Defendant (choose one) has not made a written prima facie case that a 

material change of circumstances that justifies modification of primary residential 

responsibility has occurred. 

12.

Before the court will grant an in-person hearing, the court must find that the party

requesting modification made a prima facie case that “[o]n the basis of facts that have arisen 

since the prior order or which were unknown to the court at the time of the prior order, a 

material change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the parties . . ..” (North 

Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-06.6(6)(a)). 

13.

(Choose any that apply.)

There have not been significant and material changes in circumstances of the child or

the parties. 

The changes in circumstances the Plaintiff/Defendant (choose one) included in

their motion were known at the time of the judgment Plaintiff/Defendant (choose 

one) is asking the court to modify. 

(Describe the facts that support Paragraph 13. Number each paragraph of your facts as

14.
14(a), 14(b), 14(c), and so on.  If you refer to facts from your supporting affidavit, other

supporting affidavits, or documents, include the title of the affidavit or document in parentheses

following the reference.)

www.ndcourts/legal-self-helpPage 6 of 15Ans Brief Mot PRR/Rev. Aug 2020(Paragraph 14, Continued.) 

www.ndcourts/legal-self-helpPage 7 of 15Ans Brief Mot PRR/Rev. Aug 2020II: Plaintiff/Defendant (choose one) has not made a written prima facie case that 

modification of primary residential responsibility is necessary to serve the best interests of 

the children. 

15.

If the court finds that the Plaintiff/Defendant (choose one) established a prima facie

case that a material change of circumstances that justifies modification of primary residential 

responsibility has occurred, the court can only grant an in-person hearing if the court finds that 

the party requesting modification made a prima facie case that modification of primary 

residential responsibility is necessary to serve the best interests of the children. 

16.

The factors used by the court to determine best interests are listed in North Dakota

Century Code Section 14-09-06.2.  Based on the best interest factors, modification of primary 

residential responsibility is not necessary to serve the best interests of the children as follows:  

(For Paragraphs 17 through 29, for each best interest factor, describe the facts that 
show modification is not necessary to serve the best interests of the children. If you refer to facts 

from your supporting affidavit, other supporting affidavits, or documents, include the title of the 

affidavit or document in parentheses following the reference.) 

17.

Best Interest Factor (1)(a) – The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing

between the parents and child and the ability of each parent to provide the child with nurture, 

love, affection, and guidance:
