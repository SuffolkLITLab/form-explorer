Update on the Renewal and 
Development Conference

It  is  with  careful  deliberation  that  the  North 
Dakota  State  Library  has  decided  to  cancel 
the  Renewal  and  Development  Conference  in-
person due to the concerns that the COVID-19 
(Coronavirus)  outbreak  has  risen.  We  want 
to  provide  you  with  the  same  quality  of  
conference  that  you  are  used  to,  but  the  
safety  of  the  attendees  and  our  staff  is  a  
priority.  Therefore,  we  are  currently  exploring 
ways  to  have  the  conference  virtually  through 
Zoom  or  another  system.  While  we  explore  
this  option,  if  you  have  registered  for  the 
conference,  you  will  be  refunded  for  the 
registration  fee.  You  will  be  contacted  by  us  
to facilitate those refunds. 

In  regards  to  the  professional  development 
credit  offered 
through  Valley  City  State 
University,  we  are  exploring  the  options  to  
either  get  the  attendees  the  credit  or  get  a  
refund  for  it.  This  situation  is  continuously 
developing  and,  when  we  have  more  answers, 
we  will  make  them  available  as  soon  as  we  
are able. 

Please  keep  an  eye  on  emails  and  other 
communication  from  the  North  Dakota  State 
Library  for  the  most  up-to-date  information 
about  Renewal  and  Development.  Thank  you 
for  your  understanding  and  your  continued 
patience  as  we  make  our  final  decision  in  
regards to this conference.

If  you  have  any  questions,  please  feel  free  
to  contact  State  Librarian  Mary  Soucie  at 
(701)328-4654 / msoucie@nd.gov or Continuing 
Education  Coordinator  Angie  Houser  at

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

and 

rapidly 

changing 

Circumstances  surrounding  the  COVID-19 
virus,  also  referred  to  as  the  Coronavirus,  
constantly  
are 
evolving. The  public  may  look  to  your  library 
to  serve  as  an  information  hub  about  the  
resources  and 
virus.  Consider  gathering 
posting  them  on  your  website.  The  North 
Dakota Department of Health website has up-
to-date information on the spread of COVID-19 
in  North  Dakota  as  well  as  several  resources 
to  help  you  prepare  and  steps  to  take  to  
limit  your  risk.  https://www.health.nd.gov/
diseases-conditions/coronavirus

The  Center  for  Disease  Control  (CDC)  has 
several  great  resources  that  libraries  should 
share with staff, faculty, and patrons. General 
information  about  the  virus  can  be  found  at 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
index.html. They  also  have  great  information 
on preventing illness. 

steps 

illness 

to  prevent 

Basic 
include  
washing  hands  frequently  for  at  least  20 
seconds  with  soap  and  water  or  using  a 
sanitizing  solution  if  soap  and  water  aren’t 
available,  not  touching  your  face,  staying 
home  from  work  when  sick,  and  avoiding 
contact  with  others  who  are  sick.  There  is 
conflicting 
long  the  
information  on  how 
virus  can  remain  viable  on  surfaces,  but 
the  CDC  recently  said  that  the  virus  can 
live  on  surfaces  and  in  the  air  for  up  to  3 
days.  The  American  Library  Association  has  
libraries  
compiled 

information 

to  assist 

with  pandemic  preparation.  Libraries  need 
to  think  about  how  to  handle  materials, 
what  additional  cleaning  steps  to  put  into 
place, if programs should be cancelled,  leave  
policies for staff and minimal coverage levels. 

The  State  Library  has  instituted  some  steps  
to  help  us  be  proactive.  Staff  are  using  
gloves when they are handling materials. We 
are  cleaning  our  public  access  computers, 
tables  and  other  surfaces  more  frequently.  
We  use  a  combination  of  Clorox  wipes  and 
90%  rubbing  alcohol  with  a  spray  bottle 
attachment  on  it.  We  are  also  wiping  down 
Talking  Book  cartridges  and  machines  with 
Clorox wipes.

There  are  no  changes  at  this  time  to  
InterLibrary  Loan  and  holds  fulfillment.  We  
will  continually  monitor  recommendations 
from  the  North  Dakota  Department  of  
Health,  the  Governor’s  office,  the  CDC,  and 
ALA  and  may  implement  further  measures  
as needed.

2020 Census

After  all  of  the  preparation,  conversations,  and  activities,  it  is  finally  time  for  the  2020  Census.  
We  have  shared  the  many  reasons  that  it  is  important  for  all  North  Dakotans  to  respond  to  the  
census.  Each  person  who  doesn’t  respond  represents  a  loss  of  $1,980  in  federal  funding  for  each  year  
of  the  decade.  Federal  funding  supports  many  different  activities  and  areas.  Education,  poverty  
assistance, Medicaid and other health initiatives are large programs supported with Federal dollars.

The  Institute  of  Museum  and  Library  Services  is  the  federal  agency  that  supports  libraries  and  
communities.  Each  state  library  receives  funding  through  the  Library  Services  and  Technology  Act  
(LSTA)  Grants  to  States  program.  Each  state  determines  how  to  use  the  monies.  The  North  Dakota  
State  Library  (NDSL)  uses  the  funds  to  support  statewide  databases,  collection  development  including  
our  e-book  collection,  ILL,  Talking  Books,  Library  Development,  and  Cataloging  services.  Our  federal  
dollars provide support to the library community, state government, and North Dakota citizens.

NDSL  has  worked  hard  in  partnership  with  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  educate  librarians  
and  citizens  on  the  importance  of  completing  the  census.  We  encourage  all  library  types  to  support  
census  completion  in  any  way  possible.  Another  opportunity  to  support  the  census  is  by  serving  as 
a  Mobile  Question  Assistance  Center  (MQAC).  If  you  have  an  event  happening,  consider  asking  the  
North  Dakota  Census  office  to  provide  staffing  for  an  MQAC  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  people  to  
complete the census. The Census office will provide a laptop and staffing. 

Promote  the  census  through  the  bookmarks  that  we  sent  to  public  libraries  or  through  signage  
displayed  in  your  library.  Allow  people  to  use  your  computers  to  complete  the  census.  I  shared  an  
email  to  the  North  Dakota  Library  Association  (NDLA)  contact  group  with  a  copy  of  the  Census  
Questionnaire  Assistance  (CQA)  listing  of  the  various  phone  numbers  that  can  be  called  for  those  
who  speak  different  languages.  Please  provide  the  800  numbers  that  people  can  use  to  get  
assistance in their language. The main number for English speakers is 844-330-2020. Please call or email 
NDSL if you need another copy of the email.

North  Dakota  is  expecting  our  population  to  be  the  highest  it’s  been  since  the  1930  census.  It  is  
more  important  than  ever  to  get  counted.  Please  do  all  that  you  can  to  encourage  your  community  
to complete the census. Thank you in advance for all of your help.

Program Spotlight: Coding Necklaces

Learning  to  code  doesn’t  always  need  to  involve  computers.  For  example,  use  your  
programming time to explain Binary Code to kids with a simple craft. Binary Code is any  
two-symbol system; in the case of computers, ‘0’ and ‘1’ are used to form a pattern that  
represents text, instructions, or other data. For this project, students can use this decoder  
to translate their name into binary. Then, using colored beads (one color for ‘0’ and one  
color for ‘1’ with a third color to separate the letters), they can create a necklace, bracelet, or  
keychain. For more guidance and other STEM ideas for kids, check out this blog.

State Library Reorganization

MARCH 2020

The  State  Library  is  currently  undergoing  a  reorganization  with  the  goal  of  having  all  changes 
implemented  by  July  1,  2020.  We  look  forward  to  sharing  more  information  with  the  Library  
Community  in  coming  months  about  the  changes  at  the  State  Library. We  are  excited  to  create  an  
extra  nimble  organization  that  can  be  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  our  three  constituency  
groups: the North Dakota library community, state government, and the citizens of North Dakota.

Library Vision

The  Library  Vision  strategic  plan  informs  the  Library  Vision  grant  opportunities  that  the  
North Dakota Library Coordinating Council (NDLCC), in partnership with the North Dakota 
State  Library  (NDSL),  can  offer.  It  also  serves  as  an  external  strategic  plan  for  the  State  
Library.  NDSL 
is  currently  accepting  comments  on  the  proposed  revisions  to  the  
document  through  March  31.  The  document  can  be  found  on  our  website.  Comments  
can  be  submitted  to  ndsladmn@nd.gov  or  by  contacting  any  of  the  NDLCC  members  or  
State Librarian Mary Soucie.

The State Library held a series of focus groups this past fall to get feedback on the Library 
Vision  strategic  plan. We  used  that  feedback  to  help  us  update  the  document.  We  would  
also  like  feedback  from  the  library  community  on  a  change  to  resource  sharing  and  the 
Statewide  Cataloging.  We  plan  to  continue  cataloging  for  the  libraries  that  we  currently  
catalog  for,  but  we  do  not  plan  to  add  additional  libraries  to  Statewide  Cataloging. 
We  believe  there  are  different  ways  that  we  can  support  resource  sharing  such  as  with  
collection development grants.

We look forward to receiving your comments on the document. The Coordinating Council  
will consider all comments at their April 29th meeting.

ND Library Coordinating Council Positions
Submitted by Mary Soucie, State Librarian

The  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  Council  (NDLCC)  serves  as  the  State  Library’s  
advisory  board.  The  NDLCC  assists  with  the  creation  and  implementation  of  the  Library  
Vision  strategic  plan,  the  awarding  of  the  grants,  and  serves  as  the  external  database  
review  committee.  The  Governor  appoints  NDLCC  members  according  to  Century  Code.  
There will be three terms that end on June 30, 2020. The North Dakota State Library (NDSL) 
is  accepting  nominations  for  the  following  positions:  Public  Library,  Private  Academic,  and  
At-Large;  the  first  two  seats  must  be  filled  by  a  practicing  North  Dakota  librarian  and  the  
third can be filled by a citizen or a librarian. The current Public Library and At-Large counsel 
members do plan to seek another term.

Nominations,  including  self-nominations,  may  be  sent  to  the  NDSL  Administrative  e-mail 
at  ndsladmn@nd.gov  by  April  15th. The  State  Library  will  compile  the  list  of  applicants  and  
forward it to the Governor’s office. Nominees will also need to complete an application.

This  is  an  interesting  and  exciting  opportunity  to  help  shape  library  services  in  your  state  
so  please  consider  applying.  If  you  have  questions  about  the  NDLCC,  please  contact  State 
Librarian Mary Soucie at (701)328-4654 or msoucie@nd.gov.

behind  Lumber  Janes  and  the  recent  reboot  of  
She-Ra.  In  The  Fire  Never  Goes  Out,  Stevenson  
pulls  back  the  curtain  to  share  her 
journey.  
Whether 
it’s  describing  the  time  when  they  
called  out  the  wrong  name  at  her  art  school

a  National  Book  Award  finalist,  Stevenson  is  a 
compelling creative force.

I  was  never  a  sporty  kid,  and  Gene  Luen  Yang  
wasn’t  either.  However,  once  he  became  a  high 
school  teacher  in  an  area  where  basketball  reigns

sport.  Dragon  Hoops  follows  the  year  his  high

If  you  press  me  hard,  I’d  have  to  confess  that  I 
love  Marvel  comics  just  a  little  bit  more  than  
any  other  kind.  While  I’ll  cheerlead  DC  and  all  
the  fantastic  smaller  companies  that  publish  
comics,  my  first 
love  was  Marvel.  So  Mark  
Waid’s  History  of  the  Marvel  Universe,  a  frenetic 
exploration  of  that  interconnected  world  from  
the  very  beginning,  is  perfect  for  me  and  other  
true believers.

I’ve  been  a  devoted  comic  book  reader  since  
the  mid-90s,  and  I’ve  found  lots  to  love  over  
the  past  few  decades.  This  month,  that  trend 
continues  as  we  take  a  look  at  some  of  2020’s 
newest and upcoming graphic novels.

or  even  a  loss  of  connection  between  our  work  and  the  organizations  we  represent.  Do  you  know  
why?  The  solution  is  simple,  but  it’s  not  always  the  easiest  one  to  acknowledge,  especially  when  the

Legal Research Resources for Debt Collection Cases

   

 

 

MARCH 2020

 

Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

Answering  a  summons  and  complaint  to  collect  
a  debt  is  a  frequently  requested  legal  research  
topic  by  self-represented  patrons  of  the  North 
Dakota  Supreme  Court  Law  Library  and  North 
Dakota Legal Self Help Center.

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources 
in  North  Dakota  for  answering  a  debt  collection 
summons  and  complaint  in  North  Dakota  state 
district court.

Next  month’s  article  will  get  into  more  detail  
about  answering  a  claim  affidavit  filed  in  North 
Dakota Small Claims Court.

Definitions In A Debt Collection Case

Creditor  (also  called  Original  Creditor):  a  person 
who is entitled to payment of money by a debtor.

Debtor: a person who owes money to a creditor.

Debt  Collector:  someone  who  regularly  collects 
debts  owed  to  others.  Debt  collectors  include 
collection  agencies,  lawyers  who  collect  debts  as 
part  of  their  business,  and  other  companies  that  
buy delinquent debts and try to collect them.

Plaintiff:  in  a  debt  collection  case,  the  person 
who  sues  a  debtor  to  collect  a  debt.  The  Plaintiff  
may  be  the  original  creditor,  or  may  be  a  debt 
collector.  Both  an  original  creditor  and  a  debt 
collector may be represented by a lawyer.

against  the  defendant  in  short,  plain  statements. 
The  complaint  includes  the  demand,  or  request,  
for a judgment that the Defendant owes the debt.

Answer:  a  written  response  by  a  Defendant  to 
the  debt  collection  complaint.  An  answer  admits 
or  denies  each  of  the  claims  in  the  complaint.  If  
the  Defendant  has  any  affirmative  defenses,  they 
must be included in the answer.

Affirmative  Defenses:  legal  reasons  the  Plaintiff 
should  lose,  even  if  the  Plaintiff’s  claim  that  the 
Defendant  owes  the  debt  is  true.  Examples  are 
in  the  Answering  a  Debt  Collection 
included 
Summons and Complaint Checklist. 

What Is A Debt Collection Case?

A  Plaintiff  (the  creditor  or  debt  collector)  may  
bring  a  civil  lawsuit  in  North  Dakota  state  district 
court  to  collect  a  debt  owed  by  the  Defendant 
(debtor).  If  the  judge  decides  the  Defendant  owes 
the  money,  the  judge  will  grant  a  judgment  to  
the  Plaintiff  for  the  amount  the  Plaintiff  proved  
the Defendant owes. 

Once  the  Plaintiff  has  a 
judgment  from  the  
district  court,  the  Plaintiff  can  use  any  of  the 
judgment  collection  options  available  under  
North  Dakota 
the 
Defendant’s  wages  and  seizing  the  Defendant’s 
property to pay the judgment.

including  garnishing 

law, 

Defendant:  in  a  debt  collection  case,  the  person 
who owes money, the debtor.

Answering  A  Summons  And  Complaint  In  A 
Debt Collection Case

Summons:  a  document 
that,  when  served,  
starts 
the  debt  collection  civil  action.  The  
to  answer 
summons  directs 
the  Defendant 
the  complaint  within  21  days  after  service.  The  
summons  notifies  the  Defendant  that  a  default 
if  the  
judgment  will  be  taken  against  them 
Defendant does not answer.

Complaint:  a  document  that  is  served  with  the 
summons  to  start  the  debt  collection  civil  action.  
The  complaint  describes  the  claim,  or  claims, 

Step  One:  the  Plaintiff  arranges  to  have  the 
Defendant  served  with  the  summons  and 
complaint.  In  North  Dakota  State  District  Court,  
a  debt  collection  case  starts  with  service  of  a  
copy  of 
summons  and  complaint  on  
the 
the Defendant.

Since  service  starts  the  civil  case,  the  21  day  
deadline  for  the  Defendant  to  answer  starts  to  
run  when  the  Defendant  is  served  the  summons  
and complaint.

Filing 
is  not  
the  summons  and  complaint 
required  to  start  the  case,  so  the  summons  and 
complaint  is  usually  served  on  the  Defendant 
without  a  case  number.  At  this  stage,  the  Clerk  of 
District  Court  won’t  have  any  information  about  
the  case  because  the  summons  and  complaint  
have not yet been filed.

Step  Two:  the  Defendant  calculates  their  
deadline  and  writes  their  answer  to  the  
summons  and  complaint.  Starting  the  day  after 
they  were  served,  the  Defendant  has  21  calendar 
days  to  answer  the  summons  and  complaint. 
If  the  21st  calendar  day  lands  on  a  weekend  or  
state  holiday,  the  deadline  extends  to  the  next  
day that isn’t a weekend or state holiday.

The  Defendant  must  write  an  answer  to  the 
summons  and  complaint.  The  answer  admits  or 
denies each claim.

If  the  Defendant  has  any  affirmative  defenses  to  
the  Plaintiff’s  claims,  each  affirmative  defense  
must  be  written  in  the  answer,  or  the  Defendant  
may 
lose  the  option  of  using  the  affirmative 
defense  later  in  the  case.  See  the  Answering  a  
and  Complaint  
Summons 
Debt  Collection 
Checklist for a list of examples.

Step  Three:  the  Defendant  serves  their  written 
answer  on  the  Plaintiff  within  the  21  day  
deadline.  In  order  to  meet  the  21  day  deadline, 
the  Defendant  must  arrange 
their  
written  answer  served  on  each  Plaintiff  by  no  
later than the 21st day.

to  have 

There  are  a  variety  of  ways  for  a  self-represented 
Defendant  to  arrange  to  serve  their  answer.  
The  most  common  way  to  serve  is  by  first-class  
mail,  postage  prepaid.  The  answer  is  considered 
served on the date it is mailed.

the  Plaintiff  files 

When 
the  summons  and  
complaint  with  the  District  Court,  the  Defendant  
will  receive  a  written  notice  of  the  case  number. 
Then,  the  Defendant  can  file  their  answer  and  
proof they served the answer.

Step Four: the debt collection moves forward as 
a  formal  civil  case.  Answering  the  summons  and 

MARCH 2020

complaint for debt collection allows the Defendant 
to  participate  in  the  debt  collection  case.  Many 
steps  and  procedures  may  take  place  in  a  civil  
action before the court makes a final decision.

See  the  Guide  to  a  Civil  Action  for  the  basic  steps  
and  procedures  that  may  take  place  after  a  
Defendant answers the summons and complaint.

Default Judgment

When  a  Defendant  does  not  answer  a  summons 
and  complaint,  a  Plaintiff  may  request  a  default 
judgment  against  the  Defendant.  The  Plaintiff   
must  prove  that  the  Defendant  was  correctly  
served  the  summons  and  complaint  and  did  not 
answer within the 21 day deadline.

If  the  Plaintiff  proves  the  Defendant  defaulted  
by  not  answering  the  summons  and  complaint,  
the  court  may  grant  a  default 
judgment  to  
the  Plaintiff. 
If  the  court  grants  the  default  
judgment,  the  Plaintiff  can  use  any  of  the  
judgment collection options available under North 
Dakota law.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
