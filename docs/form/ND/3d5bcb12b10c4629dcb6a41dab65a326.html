For purposes of this section:
a.

b.

"Second   or   subsequent   violation   of   a   protection   order"   means   two   or   more 
violations of protection orders.
"Sexual assault" means any nonconsensual offense in chapter 12.1-20 for which 
sexual act or sexual contact, as defined in section 12.1-20-02, is an element.
An individual who is the victim of sexual assault or the parent, stepparent, or guardian 
of a minor who reasonably believes the minor is a victim of sexual assault may seek a 
sexual assault restraining order from a court of competent jurisdiction in the manner 
provided in this section.
A petition for relief must allege facts sufficient to show the name of the alleged victim, 
the name of the individual who committed the sexual assault, and that the individual 
committed the sexual assault. An affidavit made under oath stating the specific facts 
and circumstances supporting the relief sought must accompany the petition.
If   the   petition   for   relief   alleges   reasonable   grounds   to   believe   an   individual   has 
committed sexual assault, the court, pending a full hearing, may grant a temporary 
sexual assault restraining order.
A temporary restraining order may be entered only against the individual named in the 
petition. The order must include prohibiting the individual from:
a. Harassing, stalking, or threatening the individual requesting the order;
b.
c. Contacting the individual requesting the order.
The court may grant a sexual assault restraining order prohibiting the respondent from 
contacting, harassing, stalking, or threatening the applicant, and from appearing at the 
applicant's residence, school, and place of employment if:
An individual files a petition under subsection 3;
a.
The sheriff serves the respondent with a copy of the temporary restraining order 
b.
issued under subsections 4 and 5, and with notice of the time and place of the 
hearing;
The court sets a hearing for not later than fourteen days after issuance of the 
temporary restraining order or at a later date if good cause is shown; and

A   sexual   assault   restraining   order   must   contain   a   conspicuous   notice   to   the 
respondent providing:

b. Notice   that   violation   of   the   restraining   order   is   punishable   as   a   class   A 

The specific conduct that constitutes a violation of the order;

misdemeanor; and

c. Notice that a peace officer may arrest the respondent without a warrant and take 
the respondent into custody if the peace officer has probable cause to believe the 
respondent has violated an order issued under this section.

If   the   respondent   knows   of   an   order   issued   under   subsections 4   and   5,   or 
subsection 6,   violation   of   the   order   is   a   class A  misdemeanor   and   also   constitutes 
contempt of court. A second or subsequent violation of a protection order is a class C 
felony. If the existence of an order issued under subsection 3, or subsections 4 and 5 
can be verified by a peace officer, the officer, without a warrant, may arrest and take 
into custody an individual whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has 
violated the order.

is unenforceable through civil judicial process in this state.
Knowledge of unenforceability shall be presumed, in the case of a person engaging in 
the  business,   if   any  of   the  following   exist,   and  in   the  case  of   a  person   directly  or

possess, smoke, or use cigarettes, cigars, cigarette papers, snuff, tobacco in any other 
form in which it may be utilized for smoking or chewing, electronic smoking devices, or

may   purchase   and   possess   tobacco,  electronic   smoking   devices,   or   alternative 
nicotine   products  as   part   of   a   compliance   survey   program   when   acting   with   the 
permission   of   the   individual's   parent   or   guardian   and   while   acting   under   the 
supervision of any law enforcement authority. A state agency, city, county, board of 
health, tobacco, electronic smoking devices, or alternative nicotine products retailer, or 
association  of   tobacco,  electronic  smoking  devices,  or  alternative  nicotine  products 
retailers may also conduct compliance surveys, after coordination with the appropriate 
local law enforcement authority.
Subsections 1 and 2 do not apply to an individual under twenty-one years of age who 
possesses   cigarettes,   cigarette   papers,   cigars,   snuff,   tobacco   in   any   other   form   in 
which   it   may   be   used   for   smoking   or   chewing,   electronic   smoking   devices,   or 
alternative   nicotine   products   when   required   in   the   performance   of   the   individual's 
duties as an employee.
It is a noncriminal offense for an individual under twenty-one years of age to present or 
offer to another individual a purported proof of age which is false, fraudulent, or not 
actually that individual's own proof of age, for the purpose of attempting to purchase or 
possess cigarettes, cigars, cigarette papers, snuff, tobacco in any other form in which 
it may be utilized for smoking or chewing,  electronic smoking devices, or alternative 
nicotine products.
A city or county may adopt an ordinance or resolution regarding the sale of tobacco, 
electronic   smoking   devices,   or   alternative   nicotine   products  to  individuals   under 
twenty-one years of age and use of tobacco, electronic smoking devices, or alternative 
nicotine   products  by  individuals   under   twenty-one   years   of   age  which   includes 
prohibitions in addition to those in subsection 1, 2, or 4. Any ordinance or resolution 
adopted   must   include   provisions   deeming   a   violation   of   subsection 2   or 4  a 
noncriminal violation and must provide for a fee of not less than twenty-five dollars for 
an individual  fourteen years of age or older who has been charged with an offense 
under subsection 2 or 4. The failure to post a required bond or pay an assessed fee by 
an individual found to have violated the ordinance or resolution is punishable as a 
contempt of court, except  an individual under twenty-one years of age  may not be 
imprisoned for the contempt.
An individual  fourteen years of age or older found to have violated subsection 2 or 4 
must pay a fee of twenty-five dollars.
a.

Any individual who has been cited for a violation of subsection 2 or 4 may appear 
before a court of competent jurisdiction and pay the fee by the time scheduled for 
a hearing, or if bond has been posted, may forfeit the bond by not appearing at 
the scheduled time. An individual appearing at the time scheduled in the citation 
may make a statement in explanation of that individual's action and the judge 
may waive, reduce, or suspend the fee or bond, or both. If the individual cited 
follows   the   procedures   of   this   subdivision,   that   individual   has   admitted   the 
violation and has waived the right to a hearing on the issue of commission of the 
violation.   The   bond   required   to   secure   appearance   before   the   court   must   be 
identical to the fee. This subdivision does not allow a citing officer to receive the 
fee or bond.
If an individual cited for a violation of subsection 2 or 4 does not choose to follow 
the   procedures   provided   under   subdivision a,   that   individual   may   request   a 
hearing on the issue of the commission of the violation cited. The hearing must 
be held at the time scheduled in the citation or at some future time, not to exceed 
ninety  days   later,   set   at   that   first   appearance.  At   the   time   of   a   request   for   a 
hearing on  the  issue  on  commission  of   the  violation,  the  individual cited  shall 
deposit with the court an appearance bond equal to the fee for the violation cited.

b.

Page No. 4

c.

The failure to post bond or to pay an assessed fee is punishable as a contempt of 
court, except an individual may not be imprisoned for the contempt.

The prosecution must prove the commission of a cited violation under subsection 2 
or 4 by a preponderance of the evidence.
A law enforcement officer that cites a minor for violation of this section shall mail a 
notice of the violation to the parent or legal guardian of the minor within ten days of the 
citation.
A person adjudged guilty of contempt for failure to pay a fee or fine may be sentenced 
by the court to a sanction or order designed to ensure compliance with the payment of 
the fee or fine or to an alternative sentence or sanction including community service.
