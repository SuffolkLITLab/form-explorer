NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC 

[Page 1 of 6] 

Jul 2020 

You may use these forms if: 

1.  The guardian, and/or conservator of an adult appointed by a North Dakota state 
district court is requesting that the entire guardianship and/or conservatorship 
case be transferred to the court of another state.  (This is called transferring 
jurisdiction.) 

AND 

2.  You’re the guardian, conservator, or other interested person who wants to ask 

the North Dakota state district court to appoint a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for the 
adult ward and/or protected person. 

Requesting a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for the Ward and/or Protected 
Person 

The court may appoint a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for the ward and/or protected person upon 
the request of the guardian, conservator, ward, protected person, or any interested person. 

A GAL is a lawyer appointed by the North Dakota state district court to advocate for the best 
interests of the ward and/or protected person. 

ND Laws and Rules 

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-35: Uniform Adult Guardianship and Protective 
Proceedings Jurisdiction Act contain requirements for transferring guardianships of adults.  
Chapter 28-35 is available at www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c35.html. 

•  For requirements for petitioning to transfer guardianship jurisdiction from North Dakota 
to another state, see Section 28-35-15: Transfer of Guardianship or Conservatorship to 
Another State.  (www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c35.pdf#nameddest=28-35-15) 

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-35 may reference the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure, the North Dakota Rules of Court, or the North Dakota Rules of Evidence.  The rules 
are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules. 

The North Dakota Century Code and North Dakota rules of court can also be found in print in 
many North Dakota public and academic libraries.

Step One: 

Complete the Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) Request and (Proposed) and Order For 
Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem Forms. 

A Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) is a lawyer appointed by the North Dakota state district court to 
advocate for the best interests of the ward or the protected person.  The GAL is paid by the 
ward’s or protected person’s estate. 

Appointing a GAL is optional when the Court is deciding whether to transfer jurisdiction of a 
guardianship and/or conservatorship to another state. 

If you decide to ask the Court to appoint a GAL for the ward or protected person, you’ll first 
need to find a GAL. 

No list of GAL’s specifically for guardianships or conservatorships of adults exists through the 
North Dakota Court System.  However, a GAL roster for use in child custody proceedings may 
be useful as a starting point. 

•  www.ndcourts.gov/district-court/parenting-investigator-legal-guardian-ad-litem-roster 

Request for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem by Other Interested Person: 

Caption (top of form): 

•  Complete the Caption EXACTLY as the Caption for the Notice of Petition or Petition to 
Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship is completed.  (If you don’t have a copy of the 
either document, contact the Clerk of Court.) 

Paragraphs 1 through 5: 

•  Checkmark the appropriate box or boxes. 
•  Completely fill out all of the form.  

Date and Signature: 

•  Sign and date this form. 
•  Completely fill out the lines under the signature line. 
• 

If a co-guardian or co-conservator appointed in the same case is joining the petition 
with you, they date, sign, and complete the co-guardian/co-signature lines. 

 

NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC 

[Page 3 of 6]

(Proposed) Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem: 

Caption (top of form): 

•  Complete the Caption EXACTLY as the Caption for the Notice of Petition or Petition to 
Transfer Guardianship/Conservatorship is completed.  (If you don’t have a copy of the 
either document, contact the Clerk of Court.) 

•  Fill out the information following the Title of the form as completely as you can. 

DON’T sign and date this form. 

• 

If the Court appoints a GAL AND uses your proposed order, the judge will sign and date 
the form. 

Step Two: 

Make Copies of Completed Forms; Serve Copies on ALL Persons Who Must 
Receive Notice of Documents Filed in the Case. 

Count the number of persons required to receive notice of documents filed in the case: 

•  For Guardianships: 
o  The ward; 
o  The ward’s living spouse, if any; 
o  The ward’s living adult children, if any; 
o  Any person, corporation, or institution who is serving as the ward’s guardian, 
attorney in fact, representative payee for public benefits, and conservator; 

o  The ward’s attorney; and 
o  All interested person’s named in the guardianship order. 

•  For Conservatorships: 

If no living spouse, the protected person’s living parents, if any; 

o  The protected person; 
o  The protected person’s living spouse, if any; 
o 
o  Any other guardian or conservator; 
o  Any government agency paying benefits to the protected person; and 
o  All interested person’s named in the guardianship order. 

•  For Guardianships and Conservatorships (Combined in one case): 

o  People listed above for both Guardianships and Conservatorships. 

NDCC § 28-35-15/NDLSHC 

[Page 4 of 6] 

Jul 2020 

Make a copy of the following for each person: 

•  Request for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem by Other Interested Person; and 
• 

(Proposed) Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. 

Serve one copy on each person required to receive notice: 

You may serve by hand delivery or by mail. 

Before the court will act on your petition, you must provide proof that copies of the completed 
documents were mailed or hand-delivered to all persons required to receive notice. 

A completed, dated and signed affidavit of service is your proof. 

Affidavit of service forms are included with this form set. 

Service by Hand Delivery: 

You may arrange for a person who is at least 18 years or older AND not a party or interested in 
the guardianship and/or conservatorship to hand the copies of documents to the person to be 
served. 

The person who handed copies of documents to the person to be served completes, signs and 
dates the Affidavit of Service by Hand Delivery form. 

Service by hand delivery is complete when the copies of documents are handed to the person 
to be served. 

Service by Mail: 

You may arrange for a person who is at least 18 years or older to mail copies of documents to 
the person to be served. 

Put the copies in an envelope.  Address the envelope with the last known address of the person 
to be served.  List your address as the return address on the envelope.  The person who is at 
least 18 years old takes the envelope to a United States Post Office and mails the envelope. 
First Class postage must be prepaid. 

The person who took the copies of documents to the Post Office and paid the First Class 
postage completes, signs and dates the Affidavit of Service by Mail form. 

Service by mail is complete upon mailing.

Step Three: 

File the Original, Completed Forms with the Clerk of District Court. 

File the following original, completed forms with the Clerk of the District Court that currently 
has authority over the guardianship and/or conservatorship: 

•  Request for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem by Other Interested Person; and 
• 

(Proposed) Order for Appointment of Guardian Ad Litem. 

Step Four: 

The Judge Decides Whether to Appoint a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL). 

If the Judge DOESN’T Appoint a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL): 

If the Judge doesn’t appoint a GAL for the ward and/or protected person, the case will continue 
forward without one. 

If the Judge APPOINTS a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL): 

If the Judge appoints a GAL for the ward and/or protected person, the Judge will sign an order 
for appointment. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign your proposed Order for Appointment 

of Guardian Ad Litem, or may decide to sign a different order. 

The order for appointment will list the duties and responsibilities of the GAL. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
