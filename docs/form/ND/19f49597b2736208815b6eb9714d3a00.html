      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR A NAME CHANGE – ADULT 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if these forms and 
instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer.   

• 

If you’d like to learn more about finding a lawyer to represent you, go to 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer.  

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for petitioning a North Dakota District Court for the name change of an adult.  There is 
no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help 
Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or 
information provided.  Use at your own risk. 

Requirements for name changes are found in North Dakota Century Code Chapter 32-28.  
Review the Chapter carefully. 

 

NOTE:   You (Petitioner) must be a resident of the county in North Dakota where you’re filing 

the petition for at least six months before filing the petition. 

NDLSHC

NC Inst/Rev. Jul 2022 

ALSO NOTE:   You (Petitioner) must be either a citizen or a permanent resident alien of the 

United States. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, administrative 
rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota law can be found 
in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota 
Century Code are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how laws and rules apply to your situation. 

YOU MAY ASK THE COURT TO WAIVE THE PUBLICATION REQUIREMENT 

North Dakota law requires that you publish notice of your name change in the newspaper 
before a court can consider granting your name change.  An affidavit of publication is required, 
which is provided by the newspaper. 

However, before you publish notice of your name change, you may ask the court to waive the 
publication requirement if: 

1.  You’re only asking for a change to your first or middle name; or 
2.  You’re a victim of domestic violence as defined by North Dakota Century Code Section 

14-07.1-01, which states: 

“Domestic violence includes physical harm, bodily injury, sexual activity 
compelled by physical force, assault, or the infliction of fear of imminent physical 
harm, bodily injury, sexual activity compelled by physical force, or assault, not 
committed in self-defense, on the complaining family or household members.” 

IMPORTANT:  North Dakota law only allows a court to consider the two reasons listed above 

for waiving the publication requirement. 

If the court doesn’t grant your request to waive publication in the newspaper, you’ll need to 
publish notice in the newspaper and file the affidavit of publication with the court.  The 
affidavit of publication is provided by the newspaper after publication of the notice is complete. 

This packet of forms and instructions includes the option of asking the court to waive 
publication.

CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECKS 

The court may require a criminal history background check for North Dakota or any other state.   

After you file the completed Adult Name Change Forms, affidavit of publication, and any 
written objections with the Clerk of Court, the court will decide if you’ll be required to complete 
a criminal history background check. 

If the court requires you to complete a criminal history background check, you may be directed 
to the following website to get your criminal history background check: 
fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. 

You may wish to review the requirements before you start the name change petition process. 

You’re required to pay all costs associated with the criminal history record check.

IF THE COURT GRANTS YOUR NAME CHANGE, you’ll receive or will be sent a copy of the Order 
Granting Name Change. 

HOWEVER, a certified copy (or copies) of the Order Granting Name Change may be necessary 
to change your name with agencies, businesses, entities, etc. 

IMPORTANT:  You’ll also need to request a certified copy (or copies) of the Confidential 

Information Form which MUST be attached to the Order Granting Name Change.   

• 

(If the Confidential Information Forms isn’t attached, ND Vital Records won’t accept the 
Order Granting Name Change.) 

If a hearing was held, you can request the certified copies from the Clerk of Court’s Office 
before you leave the courthouse.  If the Order has been completed, you may be able to receive 
the copy that day.   

If a hearing was not held, you can request these from the Clerk of Court’s Office.  Contact 
information for clerks of court by county may be found at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

There is a small cost for the copies: 

•  $10 for the first certified copy; 
•  $5 for each additional certified copy (if requested at the same time).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
