      <pre>Instructions for Motion for Approval for Payment of Guardian Fees 
(Based on an Hourly Rate) from the Ward’s Estate 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota.  

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you are 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if these forms 
and instructions are right for you, consult a lawyer.

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer.  

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota state district court to approve payment of fees a court-
appointed guardian of an adult has incurred.  The fees must be based on an hourly rate.  There’s no 
guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help 
Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or 
information provided. 

Use at your own risk. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

Who may use this packet of forms? 

If you’re a Guardian representing yourself, you complete and sign the forms.  If you’re unsure 
how to proceed or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation, consult a lawyer. 

Court-appointed guardians of adults must get court approval to be paid for their guardianship 
services from the Ward’s estate. 

This packet of forms may be used by the Guardian when: 

•  The Guardian has performed guardianship services for the Ward; AND 
•  The Guardian’s fees for the guardianship services are based on an hourly rate. 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-28-12(11) includes the requirement that a court-
appointed guardian of an adult must get approval from the court to receive payment for 
guardianship services. 

What if I can’t use this packet of forms? 

If you don’t fit within the requirements to use this packet of forms, you may still make a 
request to the Court to approve payment for fees for your guardianship services that aren’t 
based on an hourly rate. 

However, forms packets aren’t available to make requests for approval for payment of non-
hourly rate fees for guardianship services. 

The Guardian must create their own request documents or retain a lawyer to do so. 

What types of guardianship services might be considered for 
compensation? 

Staff of the ND Legal Self Help Center used the following resources to gather the list of 
examples on Page 4: 

•  Guidelines for New Guardians Packet (North Dakota State Court Administration) 
•  National Guardianship Association Standards (National Guardianship Association) 
•  The Fundamentals of Guardianship: What Every Guardian Should Know (National 

Guardianship Association; American Bar Association)

IMPORTANT!!  Don’t Rely Solely on this List Of Examples!!  This list of examples ISN’T an 

official court system approved list and ISN’T all inclusive.  If you provided a guardianship 
service that isn’t included on this list, you may wish to include the service in your request. 

•  Managing finances 
•  Making financial 
transactions 
•  Paying bills 
•  Managing 

correspondence 
•  Managing paperwork 
•  Gathering the Ward’s 
medical information 
•  Phone calls related to 
the guardianship

•  Developing and 
implementing a 
written guardianship 
plan 

•  Monitoring the Ward’s 
residential setting 
•  Locating and obtaining 
public benefits for 
which the Ward is 
eligible 

NOTE:  A Guardian should make provision for the care, comfort, and maintenance of the Ward.  

A Guardian, whenever appropriate, should arrange for the Ward’s training, education and 
health care services that help the Ward keep, learn, or improve their skills and functioning for 
daily living.  (N.D.C.C. § 30.1-28-12(3)) 

Ultimately, the judge or judicial referee assigned to the guardianship case decides what is a 
guardianship service, and if your fee approval request is reasonable under the circumstances. 

What may the court consider when deciding whether to approve payment 
to a Guardian for guardianship services? 

The judge or judicial referee assigned to the guardianship case may consider any or all of the 
following (the list continues on Page 5): 

•  Whether your fees for guardianship services are reasonable, well documented, and 

related to your guardianship duties. 
•  The size and nature of the Ward’s estate. 
•  The Ward’s anticipated future needs. 
•  The benefit to the Ward, or the Ward’s estate, of your guardianship services. 
•  The necessity of the guardianship services you performed. 

ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help

•  The time you spent performing the guardianship services. 
•  Whether the guardianship service you performed was routine or required more than

you performed. 

•  Your estimate of the value of the guardianship services you performed. 
•  The fee customarily charged in the community for similar services. 
•  The nature and length of your relationship with the Ward. 
•  Any conflict of interest you may have related to the guardianship service you 

performed. 

•  Whether your appointment as Guardian prevents you from other employment.
