New Guardian Guidelines CS/Rev May 2022 

Managing the Ward’s Health and Wellbeing 

Congratulations on your appointment as a guardian or conservator! 

Your role is vital in providing care and assistance to North Dakota’s most vulnerable adults! 
This packet will provide guidance and direction to you in your new role, and serves as a 
reference to resources and service organizations available to you.  

 

   

What are my immediate responsibilities as a new guardian?  

ou should purchase several certified copies of the Letters of Guardianship from the district 
court. Review the Letters to determine the degree of authority that the court has appointed to 
you. If you have not yet viewed the online training on the North Dakota Supreme Court’s 
website, you should do that as soon as possible.  

he Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian requires you to involve the ward as much 
as possible in all decision-making and lifestyle choices. Your first important task is to explain to 
the ward to the best of your ability, what it means for them to have you as a guardian.  

ithin 90 days, a Beginning Inventory report will need to be submitted to the Court. (Fillable 

forms and instructions are available under “Legal Self Help & Forms” at ndcourts.gov.) If 
another party has been appointed financial authority, they may complete the inventory report and 
submit it to the court. As a named guardian, you will want to ensure that the ward has sufficient 
funds to maintain care now and into the future. You will also want to help protect the ward from 
financial exploitation. More information on the Beginning Inventory is presented in “Managing 
the Ward’s Financial Welfare.” 

nterested persons may need to be notified of your new appointment as guardian. This may 
include the ward’s employer, health care providers, Power of Attorney agents, family members, 
service providers, the post office, the IRS, the Social Security Administration, and home care 
providers. Some of these agencies may require a certified copy of your Letters of Guardianship.  

our ward may have vital documents that you will need to keep safe. Look for a will, healthcare 

directive, power of attorney, and other legal documents. Determine if the ward has specified 
funeral and burial choices and if any insurance or other arrangements have already been made. 
Plan appropriately for funeral and burial costs.  

Whenever you are doing business for your ward, bring a certified copy of the Letters of 
Guardianship to show that you are authorized by the court to act on the ward’s behalf.

What are my ongoing responsibilities as a guardian?  

hoosing the least restrictive environment:  

Your primary obligation is to ensure that the ward has adequate food, shelter, clothing, and 
healthcare. The ward has a right to a safe and humane living environment which is the least 
restrictive environment available. The ward may need assistance with residential services, 
transportation, employment or daytime activities, meal delivery or other services. Assess the 
ward’s needs and request input from care staff and family as to the ward’s wellbeing.  

e a part of the ward’s daily life:  

Make regular personal visits to monitor the ward’s progress and adequacy of services being 
provided. These visits will also help you determine if the ward continues to reside in the least 
restrictive living environment. Monthly visits are recommended. If you have authority to make 
medical decisions, you are encouraged to attend regular appointments with your ward. You will 
need to have a clear understanding of the ward’s medical needs, concerns, and options available.  

anaging the estate:  

Please review “Managing the Ward’s Financial Welfare” for information and guidance. You, or 
the conservator, will be responsible for filing an annual accounting to the court. A final 
accounting is required upon the death of the ward. 

uardian as advocate:  

Guardians, co-guardians, and conservators are responsible for ensuring that the ward is receiving 
all of the benefits and care that they need or are qualified to receive. It is essential that you gain 
knowledge of the services offered in the ward’s community that will assist the ward in 
maintaining independence and living in the least restrictive environment. As the coordinator of 
the ward’s care, you will be monitoring the services provided and advocating for the ward’s: 

• quality of personal care 
• education and physical fitness  
• access to the community 
• access to services 

• confidentiality and privacy 
• freedom from abuse and neglect 
• civil and property rights 
• entertainment and leisure time activities 

ecision making:  

As a guardian, you will need to maintain a relationship with the ward and make decisions on 
behalf of the ward. These decisions will be made after considering the ward’s preferences and 
opinions, and religious and cultural values. You may have heard of the principle of “substituted 
judgment”; this refers to the requirement that the guardian make decisions that reflect what the 
ward would have decided if he or she were capable of making the decision.  

f you are unable to determine what the ward would have decided, you are required to make 
decisions based on the best interest of the ward. You are always encouraged to discuss situations 
with the ward’s caregivers, family, and friends unless doing so would violate the ward’s privacy. 
When making decisions based on the best interest of the ward, you must select the least intrusive, 
least restrictive course of action.

What are some limitations of my guardianship?  

our ward always retains the rights to privacy and confidentiality, communication with others, 

equal treatment under the law, explanations for medical treatment and options, notice of all 
guardianship proceedings, review of their personal records, and continuous review of a prospect 
for restoration of their rights.  
 

•  Review the Letters for any limits on authority that the court has noted. Additionally, 
North Dakota law restricts guardians from acting in these instances without obtaining 
specific court approval: psychosurgery, sterilization or abortion, experimental treatments, 
or to force admittance into a medical institution. Review the North Dakota Century Code 
statutes: ndlegis.gov/cencode/t30-1.html chapters 30.1-28 and 30.1-29.  

•  Guardians may charge the ward’s estate for reasonable guardianship service fees, if 

approved by the court. You may not use ward’s funds for room and board that you or 
your family provide to the ward without prior approval from the court.  

•  You must file an annual report on the wellbeing of the ward and report all relevant 

information for the court’s review. See more information below.  

•  The guardianship may not be modified or rescinded without a court order; however, it 

will expire within five years. At that time, the court will review the case to determine if 
the guardianship should continue or be modified. The court will provide you with 
instructions on your role in this review when it is scheduled. 

•  A ward’s will or contracts made before a guardian was appointed may only be altered by 

a court. 

•  A ward’s durable power of attorney made before a guardian was appointed may require 

revocation or alteration by a court. Consult an attorney. 

ow do I prepare for the annual report? 

eep track of your visits to the ward and note changes in medical treatment, residence, or other 

changes in the ward’s life. Preview the annual report form available at the “Legal Self Help & 
Forms” link at ndcourts.gov so you know what to expect for your first report to the court. Even if 
you do not have financial authority, review “Managing the Ward’s Financial Welfare” so you are 
aware of how the ward’s estate should be managed. Notify the court and provide a final financial 
report if your ward passes away.  

Time frame reminder: the Beginning Inventory Report is due in 90 days, and the 
Annual Report will be due in 365 days.  

elpful definitions: as defined by the National Guardianship Association.  

est Interest: to be used in decision-making when the guardian cannot determine the preference 

of the ward, or when the ward’s preference will cause substantial harm. Choices should reflect 
the least intrusive, least restrictive options that promote the ward’s wellbeing. 

iduciary: a party responsible for some or all of the ward’s finances.

Least Restrictive Environment: guardians need to be informed on the living arrangements, 
community options, and health services available to the ward, and select the options that:  

•  meet the preference of the ward, if possible 
•  are in the best interest of the ward 
• 
least inhibit the ward’s freedom  
•  allows the ward to participate in the community 
•  provide protection for the ward while maximizing the ward’s independence  

ubstituted Judgment: this decision-making tool promotes the self-determination of the ward 
in instances where the ward’s preference is known or can be determined. This option is ethically 
preferred and, when possible, the guardian shall make choices in conformity with the preference 
of the ward.  

ow do I plan for the termination of the guardianship? 

  
Upon the death of the ward, notify the court and interested persons and provide them with a copy 
of the will. You may find the relevant forms at the “Legal Self Help & Forms” link at 
ndcourts.gov. It is important to plan now for the ward’s funeral and burial arrangements 
including financial provisions. You should also consider options for a possible successor 
guardian in case of a guardian’s death or inability to provide services. If you have financial 
authority, please review “Managing the Ward’s Financial Welfare” for more information.

Managing the Ward’s Financial Welfare 
 
Information for conservators and guardians with financial authority.  

ow do I “marshal the assets”? 

f you have been awarded financial authority for a ward, it is important to locate and secure assets 
quickly to protect them from loss or damage. Identify all of the assets that a ward owns or has an 
interest in, so you can adequately manage them in the best interest of the ward. Marshal means to 
identify, locate, list, and claim these assets.  

  Step 1  Purchase several certified copies of the Letters of Guardianship. 

The district court will certify the Letters of Guardianship that will vouch for your new 
authority. You will need to present these Letters upon request while managing the estate. 
Most banks and other institutions will likely require an original document, and you may get 
a discount for purchasing several at a time from the court. 

  Step 2  Identify assets and complete a list.  

•  You might begin with larger assets such as real estate and vehicles. Find the deeds, 

mortgages, tax, and insurance documents to determine if the ward owned them in whole 
or in part. Remember to look for mineral rights, rental agreements, etc. 
Identify all checking, savings, and money market accounts owned by your ward.  
Identify all income sources and investment accounts: make a list that includes the 
monthly benefits and current balances. 

• 
• 

•  Make a list of general personal property items and estimate a value for the entire group. 

General items will include clothing, furniture, household goods, etc. 

•  Higher-priced personal property such as antiques, art or jewelry should be listed and 

valued separately.  

•  Search for all insurance policies: life, health, home, auto, burial, etc. If a high-value item 

is not insured, you should consult with the ward’s insurance agent.  

•  Take photos of personal and physical assets.  
•  Also see information below in “Tips for Hard to Find Assets.”  

  Step 3  Establish guardianship checking and savings accounts.  

•  You will need to open new checking and savings accounts with your ward’s social 
security number, but with your name on the account as the guardian or conservator. 
Banks generally refer to these as “fiduciary” or “convenience” accounts.  

•  Choose a bank account that is FDIC insured, and that minimizes fees. 
•  Divide any joint accounts and remove your ward’s share from the account. 
•  Any significant amounts of cash should be deposited at a bank; cash transactions made by 

the guardian should be minimal. 

•  You may need to update direct deposit information on income sources before you close 

or remove your ward’s name from the old accounts. 

•  Remember that your ward’s income and assets must always be kept separate from other 

accounts, and never commingled with the guardian’s or other’s funds.  

  H

Securing the assets is the first step in managing the ward’s estate.  

What about debt and creditors?  
Determine all of the ward’s debts including loans and credit cards as well as local supplier’s credit 
accounts.  

•  Review bank statements to determine automatic payments. 
•  Consider amounts due to household staff, outstanding medical bills, etc.  
•  The ward may have new debt related to the guardianship proceeding. 
•  Notify creditors of the address change for billing purposes – in general, business mail 

should be addressed to you with an extra line stating “As guardian for (ward’s name).”  

•  Request a free credit report: www.AnnualCreditReport.com.  
•  Create a list of all loans and debt: this represents the ward’s known liabilities.  
•  Close credit accounts if the ward will not have authority to use them. 

You are now ready to complete the Beginning Inventory report for the district court! 
Find the form at www.ndcourts.gov at the Self Help link. 

ssets and income that require special attention.  

• 

• 

• 

• 

If the ward is entitled to Social Security benefits, you may need to contact the Social 
Security Administration and apply to become a Representative Payee. 
If the ward is entitled to veteran’s benefits, you may need to contact the Veteran’s 
Administration to apply to become a VA Fiduciary.  
If the ward owns real estate, the deeds will remain in the ward’s name; however, the 
mailing addresses for statements, taxes, and leases will need to be updated to the 
guardian’s mailing address.  
Investment companies may have varying policies on how they would like the accounts 
named. Notify each of them by sending them a certified copy of the Letters; at a 
minimum they will require an address update.  

•  Again, business mail will generally be addressed to you with an extra line stating “As 

guardian for (ward’s name).  

ther important documents to search for.  

Your ward may have vital documents that you will need to keep safe. Look for a will, healthcare 
directive, power of attorney, or other legal documents. Determine if the ward has specified funeral 
and burial choices and if any insurance or other arrangements have already been made.  

ips for hard-to-find assets.  

•  The Internal Revenue Service may be able to help you determine a ward’s assets and 
sources of income. Complete IRS Form 4506-T Request for Transcript of Tax Return, 
check item #8, and include a certified copy of your Letters. The IRS will mail you a list 
of financial institutions that have reported information about your ward to the IRS.  

•  Check the Unclaimed Property site for North Dakota property: 

http://www.land.nd.gov/UnclaimedProperty/.  

•  Ask the officers at the ward’s bank to check for other accounts or safe deposit boxes.

How do I manage the estate?  
After you have identified all of the ward’s assets, income, and debt, you will need to complete the 
Beginning  Inventory  report:  www.ndcourts.gov  at  the  “Self  Help”  link.  Next,  you  should  start 
planning the management and protection of your ward’s estate. This is the time to develop a budget 
with monthly income and estimated monthly expenses.  

•  Expenses should be paid from the new fiduciary checking account. Bills should rarely be 
paid with cash as it is difficult to account for cash on the annual reports to the court.  
•  Loans or other debt may need to be renegotiated to ensure that there is enough income to 

adequately cover the ward’s needs.  

•  Maintain payments on insurance policies as appropriate. 
•  Contact the IRS to update the ward’s mailing address and determine if the ward is 

required to make quarterly federal income tax payments.  

•  Reasonable amounts of cash may be given to the ward as personal spending money. 
Handling small amounts of cash will allow the ward to retain some independence. 
•  Reasonable guardianship fees may be charged to the ward. However, you may not use 
ward’s funds for room and board that you or your family provide to the ward without 
prior approval from the court.  

•  Develop a maintenance plan for the ward’s physical property. 
•  Always include the ward as much as possible in financial decision making.  
•  You must apply for any public benefits that the ward may be eligible to receive.  
•  Plan appropriately for funeral and burial costs. If possible, clarify who will manage the 

ward’s estate after the death of the ward.  
 

Best practices for financial management.  

•  Your primary obligation is to ensure that the ward has adequate food, shelter, clothing, 
and healthcare, and lives in a safe environment. If the ward has unpayable debts, seek 
advice from a consumer credit counseling agency.  
If your ward has funds remaining after providing for their daily needs, the money may be 
saved or spent on items that improve their quality of life. Expenditures for furniture, 
home improvements, or recreational items would all be appropriate.  

• 

•  Make sensible, low-risk investments with your ward’s money; wise investing will help 

ensure future financial stability. 

•  Depending on the ward’s income, you will be responsible for filing income tax returns on 
behalf of your ward. If the ward has missed filings in previous years, contact the IRS; 
they may waive penalties because of the ward’s incapacity.  
If funds are available, purchase funeral insurance or maintain a separate burial savings 
account for the ward.  

• 

•  Become familiar with the regulations on benefits the ward is receiving, such as amounts 

allowed for savings or burial accounts.  

•  Never combine your own funds with your ward’s money, even if you had joint accounts 

prior to the guardianship. 

•  Guardians must never enter into transactions that benefit themselves.  

Always manage the estate in the best interest of the ward.

How do I prepare for the annual report? 
Keep  your receipts  and invoices, and  statements  from investments, banks, and  creditors  for  all 
transactions  you  make  on  behalf  of  the  ward.  (Maintaining  documentation  for  5  years  is 
recommended.) You will need to report to the court all of the income you receive for the ward, all 
of  the  money  you  spend,  and  the  balance  of  the  ward’s  estate  each  year.  Keep  a  record  of  the 
purpose of the transactions you’ve made, and have this information available for a review. Keep 
track of your visits to the ward, and the decisions you have made on behalf of the ward and the 
estate. Preview the annual report form so you know what to expect for your first report to the court, 
available at the “Self Help” link at www.ndcourts.gov.  

hen does my financial responsibility end?  

Authority terminates when you or the ward passes away, or when ordered by a court. Upon the 
death of the ward, financial authority passes to the ward’s Personal Representative (PR). You will 
need to provide the court and interested persons with a copy of the will and a final accounting. 
You will turn assets over to the PR or as directed by the court. Petitions to end the guardianship 
and final report forms are available at the “Self Help” link at www.ndcourts.gov.  

hat are some limitations of guardians of the estate?  
•  A guardian cannot take away powers or rights from the ward that the judge did not 

approve beforehand.  

•  A ward’s will, durable power of attorney, or contracts made before a guardian was 

appointed may only be altered by a court.  

•  A guardian may not make risky investments with a ward’s funds. 
•  As guardian, you may not borrow money or assets from the ward, and you may not spend 

the ward’s funds to benefit your own purposes.  

•  The court is required to review annual reports to protect the well-being of the ward.  
•  A guardian may rescind their appointment as a guardian only with a court order.  
•  Unless approved by the court, a guardian may not use the ward’s funds for room and 

board if the guardian or the guardian’s spouse, parent, or child provides these to the ward. 

•  The guardian must follow ND Century Code statutes as they pertain to care of wards: 

http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t30-1.html §30.1-28 and -29.  

•  Remember that excess funds must be safely invested for future needs of the ward. 
•  Guardians are never personally liable for a ward’s existing debt.

Rev 4/19 

Model Code of Ethics for Guardians 
Adapted from the National Guardianship Association 

 

ule 1 - Decision-Making  The guardian shall exercise extreme care when making 
decisions on behalf of a ward. All decisions shall be made in a manner which protects 
the rights of the ward, and maximizes independence and self-reliance.  

he  guardian  shall  make  all  reasonable  efforts  to  ascertain  the  preferences  of  the 
ward, both past and current, when making decisions. The guardian shall conform to 
those preferences except when they are reasonably certain that substantial harm will 
result from such a decision. When the preferences of the ward cannot be ascertained, 
a guardian is responsible for making decisions which are in the best interests of the 
ward. 

ule 2 – Relationship  The guardian shall exhibit the highest degree of trust, loyalty, 
and  fidelity  in  relation  to  the  ward.  The  guardian  shall  protect  the  personal  and 
financial interests of the ward and foster the ward’s growth, independence and self-
reliance to the maximum degree.  

ule 3 – Custody of the Person  The guardian shall assume legal custody of the 
ward and ensure the ward resides in the least restrictive environment available. The 
guardian  shall  be  aware  of  the  options  and  alternatives  available  for  the  ward’s 
residence. The ward should live in a non-institutional environment whenever possible.  

ule  4  –  Consent  to  Care  and  Services    The  guardian  shall  assume  legal 
responsibility to provide informed consent on behalf of the ward for care, treatment, 
and services and shall ensure that such treatment represents the least restrictive form 
of intervention available.  

ule  5  –  Management  of  the  Estate    The  guardian  of  the  estate  shall  provide 
competent management of the property and income of the estate. The guardian shall 
exercise intelligence, prudence, and diligence and avoid any self-interest.  

ule  6  -  Termination  and  Limitation    The  guardian  has  an  obligation  to  seek 
termination or limitation of the guardianship whenever indicated. The guardian shall 
seek evidence of improvements in the capabilities of the ward, and shall assist the 
ward in arranging independent representation.   
 

Conclusion  

he need to balance the protection of the ward with the goal of maximizing the ward’s 
independence presents a complex mix of decisional factors. To the extent the ward is 
able to participate, the guardian has a duty to share relevant information with the ward 
and  aim  toward  the  goal  of  joint  decision  making.  Refer  to  Rule  1  for  guidance  in 
situations not specifically addressed in the model.

Protecting Vulnerable Adults from 
Abuse and Financial Exploitation 

s a care provider, or one guiding the decision-making of a vulnerable adult, you are 
in a unique position to help expose abusers. You can prevent abuse or intervene early 
when the threat is from trusted persons, stranger scams, property theft, etc.  

amily, friends, neighbors, caregivers, fiduciaries, business people, and others may try 
to take advantage of a vulnerable adult. They may take money without permission, fail 
to repay money they owe, charge too much for services, or just not do what they were 
paid to do. Someone with a legal obligation to handle the vulnerable person’s finances 
may fail to use the funds for necessities like food, clothing, shelter and health care, 
putting the vulnerable adult at risk of harm. Abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation 
take many different forms. 

igns that may indicate neglect or abuse: 
Conditions:  

•  Missing credit cards, check blanks, or other important papers.  
•  Unusual volume of banking activity or unpaid bills.  
•  Ward is lacking basics like clean clothes, or has other signs of physical neglect.  
•  Missing medications or possessions.  
•  Bruises, weight loss, poor hygiene.  

 
Behavior:  

•  Ward is agitated after a family member or friend visits.  
•  Family member or agent declines recommended medical treatment.  
•  A ward seems pressured by family to make a decision or sign a document.  
•  Formerly outgoing adult has become withdrawn or seems afraid.  
•  Conflicts concerning finances between ward’s children.  
•  Frequent moves to new long-term care facilities.  
•  Caregiver is isolating the vulnerable adult.

hen should I call? 

  T

  W

If you feel neglect or financial exploitation may be occurring, call the abuse hotline to 
report your concerns. If you suspect the adult is in imminent danger of sexual or other 
physical abuse, please call 911 for immediate intervention. You may then follow up 
with a call to the hotline.  

Pillars of Successful Intervention 

Prevent – through awareness and training 
Recognize – spot the warning signs and take action 
Report – tell the authorities to trigger responses 

                   

Anything else I can do?  
Depending on your role, these tips may help you be proactive in caregiving:  

 

•  Remind the ward not to give out personal information or credit card numbers 

over the phone. 

•  Examine bank accounts and credit card statements.  
•  Review spending from personal accounts at residential facilities. 
•  Monitor that appropriate payments are made to the long-term care facility.  
•  Check the background on a person selling investments: 888-295-7422. 
•  Report scams to Consumer Protection at 800-472-2600. Call the ND Securities 

Department to report investment fraud at 800-297-5124.  

•  Add the ward’s land and cell phone numbers to the Do Not Call Registry at: 

https://www.donotcall.gov/ or call 888-382-1222.  

•  Opt out of receiving both junk mail and email at: http://www.dmachoice.org/.  
•  Visit www.carechoice.nd.gov for a listing of resources available to your ward.  
•  Stop companies from collecting online cookies: www.networkadvertising.org.  
•  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provided much of this material:
