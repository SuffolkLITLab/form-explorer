non-criminal traffic violation. 

Step Two:  Within 14 days of the date of the non-criminal traffic citation, post 
(pay) bond, and notify the Clerk of Court that you elect (choose) to 
take a driver training course in lieu (instead) of entry of points. 

The Clerk of Court notifies the North Dakota Department of 
Transportation.  

Step Three: 

Immediately sign up for an approved driver training course. 

The North Dakota Department of Transportation approves all driver 
training courses. 

You must pay for the course in full. 

Step Four: 

Attend the driver training course. 

Step Five:  Within 30 days of notifying the Clerk of Court, submit your certificate 

of completion to the North Dakota Department of Transportation. 

You have 30 days to complete the course and submit your certificate to

SECTION ONE: 
INFORMATION ABOUT CHOOSING TO TAKE A DRIVER TRAINING COURSE 
INSTEAD OF ACCUMULATING POINTS FROM A NON-CRIMINAL TRAFFIC 
VIOLATION 

WHAT IS ELECTING TO TAKE A DRIVER TRAINING COURSE IN LIEU OF ENTRY OF 
POINTS ON A LICENSEE’S DRIVING RECORD? 

A person who receives a citation for a non-criminal traffic violation may elect (choose) to take 
an approved driver training course in lieu (instead) of having points entered on their driving 
record.  This is referred to as an alternative disposition of the non-criminal traffic violation. 

By choosing this alternative disposition, the person admits they committed the non-criminal 
traffic violation.  However, up to 5 points aren’t added to the person’s driving record if all of 
the following requirements are met: 

•  The person who received the citation for the non-criminal traffic violation hasn’t used 

this alternative disposition within the last 12 months; 

•  The non-criminal traffic violation isn’t assigned 6 or more points; 
•  The bond amount must be paid within 14 days of the date on the citation; 
•  At the time the bond amount is paid, the Clerk of Court must be notified the person is 

choosing this alternative disposition; 

•  Within 30 days of notifying the Clerk of Court, the approved driver training course must 

be completed and a certificate of completion submitted to the North Dakota 
Department of Transportation (NDDOT). 

WHAT IF I DON’T CHOOSE THIS ALTERNATIVE DISPOSITION? 

When you receive a citation for a non-criminal traffic violation in North Dakota, you may either: 

•  Admit you committed the non-criminal traffic violation by paying the fine; or 
•  Pay bond to request a hearing to contest the non-criminal traffic violation. 

To pay your citation, go to ndcourts.gov/public-access.  If you’re unable to pay online, contact 
the Clerk of Court directly. 

To pay bond (the amount of the fine) and request a hearing, review Requesting a Hearing for a 
Non-Criminal Traffic Violation Informational Guide. 

Go to the North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) webpage, dot.nd.gov, for 
information about reducing points on your driving record.

WHAT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TERMS? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they’re not intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms.*** 

Alternative Disposition – When certain requirements are met, state law (N.D.C.C. Section 39-
06.1-10.1) allows a person who received a citation for a non-criminal traffic violation to admit 
to the violation and take an approved driver training course to avoid having points added to 
their driving record.  The certificate of completion of the course must be submitted to the 
North Dakota Department of Transportation within 30 days of notifying the Clerk of Court. 

Criminal Traffic Violations – In general, traffic violations are non-criminal.  However, the 
following are criminal traffic violations (N.D.C.C. Section 39-06.1-05): 

•  Driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of Section 39-08-01, 

or an equivalent municipal ordinance.  

•  Reckless driving or aggravated reckless driving in violation of Section 39-08-03, or an 

equivalent municipal ordinance. 

•  A violation of Chapter 12.1-16 resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle. 

•  Leaving the scene of an accident in violation of Section 39-08-04, 39-08-05, 39-08-07, or 

39-08-08, or equivalent municipal ordinances.  

•  Driving while license or driving privilege is suspended or revoked in violation of Section 

39-06-42, or an equivalent municipal ordinance. 

•  Violating subdivision b or c of subsection 5 of Section 39-24-09, relating to unsafe 

operation of snowmobiles. 

•  Operating an unsafe vehicle in violation of subsection 2 of Section 39-21-46. 

•  Causing an accident with an authorized emergency vehicle or a vehicle operated by or 
under the control of the director used for maintaining the state highway system in 
violation of subsection 5 of Section 39-10-26. 

Individuals who are guilty of criminal traffic violations must pay a fine or fines, and will have a 
misdemeanor or felony on their criminal record. 

District Court – The state trial court of general jurisdiction with service in each of North 
Dakota’s 53 counties.  Decisions about criminal and non-criminal traffic violations may be 
handled by a district court.  District courts are also the appeal courts for municipal court 
decisions involving criminal and non-criminal traffic violations. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 4 of 10 

Driver Training Instead of Points/Jun 2022 

Municipal Court – The trial court for the city or municipality.  Municipal courts have jurisdiction 
over all violations of municipal ordinances, except certain violations involving juveniles.  
Decisions about criminal and non-criminal traffic violations may be handled by a municipal 
court.  Municipal court criminal and non-criminal traffic violation decisions may be appealed to 
district court. 

Municipal Ordinances – An ordinance is a law passed by a municipal government, such as a city 
or county. 

Non-Criminal (Administrative) Traffic Violations – In general, traffic violations in state law 
(N.D.C.C. Chapter 39-07) and municipal ordinances are non-criminal.  Individuals who are guilty 
of non-criminal traffic violations must pay a fine or fines, but won’t have a misdemeanor or 
felony on their criminal record. 

North Dakota Century Code – The laws of North Dakota, also called statutes, which are enacted 
by the North Dakota State Legislative Assembly and signed by the North Dakota Governor. The 
North Dakota Century Code is often referred to as the “Century Code,” or the “N.D.C.C.” 

North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) – A state agency to which criminal and 
non-criminal traffic convictions are reported by municipal and district courts.  (dot.nd.gov; (701) 
328-2600) 

Points – Many traffic violations are assigned a certain number of points based on the 
seriousness of the offense. When a driver accumulates 12 or more points on their record, or a 
driver under age 18 accumulates 6 or more points, the North Dakota Department of 
Transportation (NDDOT) suspends the driver’s license. 

Prosecuting Attorney – The lawyer who represents either the city or municipality for ordinance 
violations, or the lawyer who represents the State of North Dakota for state law violations.

SECTION TWO: 
THE PROCESS TO CHOOSE TO TAKE A DRIVER TRAINING COURSE INSTEAD 
OF ACCUMULATING POINTS FROM A NON-CRIMINAL TRAFFIC VIOLATION 

STEP ONE: Determine whether the District Court or Municipal Court is handling 
the non-criminal traffic violation. 

The non-criminal traffic violation may be handled by a municipal court or a district court, 
depending on if the offense is a violation of a municipal ordinance or state law. 

Look at the citation and envelope you received when the non-criminal traffic violation occurred. 

•  The envelope will have the address of the court. 
• 

If you don’t have the envelope, the citation will indicate if the violation is of an 
ordinance or state law. 

o  For violation of an ordinance, the municipal court is handling the violation. 
o  For violation of a state law, the district court is handling the violation.  

Contact information for North Dakota municipal courts and North Dakota district courts is 
available at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

•  Click on the County name for contact information for Clerks of District Court. 
•  Scroll to the bottom of the webpage for contact information for Clerks of Municipal 

Court. 

STEP TWO: Within 14 days of the date of the non-criminal traffic citation, post 
(pay) bond, notify the Clerk of Court that you elect (choose) to take a driver 
training course in lieu (instead) of entry of points. 

Within 14 days of the date on you non-criminal traffic citation, you must post (pay) the bond, 
which is the amount of the citation. 

You post (pay) the bond in one of two ways: 

1.  Pay by mail using the citation and envelope you received at the time of the violation. 
  Indicate on the citation that you’re requesting a hearing and posting the bond. 

2.  Pay in person at the Clerk of Court’s office. 

NOTE:  When you post (pay) your bond, you admit the violation as stated on the citation. Your 

bond will be used to pay the amount of the citation. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 7 of 10 

Driver Training Instead of Points/Jun 2022 

At the same time you post (pay) the bond, notify the Clerk of Court that you are electing 
(choosing) to take a driver training course in lieu (instead) of entry of points. 

You notify the Clerk of Court in one of two ways: 

1.  If you pay by mail, mail your written notice to the Clerk of Court in the same envelope as 

the citation. 

2.  If you pay in person, hand your written notice to the Clerk of Court at the time you pay. 

NOTE:  A notice form is included at the end of this guide.  You may choose to use the form, or 

create your own written notice. 

If both your payment and notice are accepted by the Clerk of Court, the Clerk will inform the 
North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) of your election. 

You have no further obligation to the court once the Clerk of Court informs the NDDOT. 

You have 30 days from the date you notified the Clerk to Court to complete the course and 
submit your certificate of completion to the NDDOT. 

•  The Clerk of Court and the instructor of the course aren’t responsible for submitting 

your certificate to the NDDOT.  THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! 

STEP THREE: Immediately sign up for an approved driver training course. 

Go to the North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) website to find all approved 
driver training courses for point reduction. 

The website is dot.nd.gov/divisions/driverslicense/dldriverinfo.htm.  Contact the NDDOT 
directly if you have questions about the information on their website. 

Use the link for the course to find out about the course and how to sign up.  You must pay for 
the course in full. 

You have 30 days from the date you notified the Clerk to Court in STEP TWO to complete the 
course and submit your certificate of completion to the NDDOT. 

(This space left intentionally blank.) 

   

 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 8 of 10 

Driver Training Instead of Points/Jun 2022 

STEP FOUR: Attend the driver training course. 

The instructor of the course will provide you a certificate of completion.  Keep a copy of the 
certificate for your records. 

Failure to attend and complete the driver training course results in the following: 

•  You forfeit your payment to take the course; and 
•  The points from your non-criminal traffic violation are added to your driving record. 

STEP FIVE: Within 30 days of notifying the Clerk of Court in STEP TWO, submit 
your certificate of completion to the North Dakota Department of 
Transportation (NDDOT). 

Once you’ve completed the course, you’re responsible for submitting your certificate of 
completion to the North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT). 

•  The Clerk of Court and the instructor of the course aren’t responsible for submitting 

your certificate to the NDDOT.  THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! 

You must submit your certificate within 30 days from the date you notified the Clerk to Court in 
Step Two. 

If the instructor of the course doesn’t give you the email or mailing address of where to send 
your certificate, contact the NDDOT directly and ask.  (dot.nd.gov) 

POINTS TO REMEMBER!! 

1.  You may only use this alternative disposition once every 365 days (12 months); 
2.  This alternative disposition is only for non-criminal traffic violations; 

  This can’t be used for criminal traffic violations (see Definitions section on Pages 

4 and 5). 

3.  Up to 5 points aren’t added to the person’s driving record if all of the requirements for 

this alternative disposition are met; and 

  Points can’t be “banked” for a later non-criminal traffic violation. 

4.  If you choose this alternative disposition, you lose any point reduction option under 

N.D.C.C. Section 39-06.1-13.

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

You’re not required to hire a lawyer to represent you in an action in North Dakota state courts.  
If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that a 
lawyer is required to follow. 

Lawyer Resources 

If you decide to find a lawyer to represent you, you may find the following options of interest. 

•  Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal 

assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income. Legal 
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income 
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance 
based on income. The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is 
legalassist.org. 

•  The State Bar Association provides a lawyer referral service to match paying clients in 
need of legal services with lawyers. The phone number is (866) 450-9579 and the 
website is sband.org.  The cost is $30.00 for a 30 minute consultation with a lawyer.

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that a lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled.  For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
