      <pre>Instructions for Motion to Add a Co-Guardian 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you are 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When  you  represent  yourself,  you’re  held  to  the  same  requirements  and 
responsibilities as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If 
you’re unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer.

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota state district court to add a Co-Guardian to an existing 
guardianship of an adult.  There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms 
available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The Center isn’t responsible for any

Purpose 

These forms may be used by a current Guardian to ask the North Dakota State District Court to 
add a Co-Guardian to the existing guardianship of an adult. 

If the District Court approves the request, the current Guardian and the new Co-Guardian both 
act as guardian for the Ward.  

North Dakota Century Code Chapter 30.1-28 gives the requirements and procedures related to 
District Court proceedings for guardianship of an adult. 

If you’re a Guardian representing yourself, you complete and sign the forms.  If you’re unsure 
how to proceed or unsure if these forms are suitable for your situation, consult an attorney. 

The Nominated Co-Guardian MUST Complete the Guardian Qualification and Training 
Requirements 

Before completing the forms packet, the person nominated to be appointed Co-Guardian MUST 
complete the Rule 59 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules guardian 
qualification and training requirements. 

The person nominated to be appointed Co-Guardian should review Rule 59 carefully! 

The North Dakota Guardianship Training Course and affidavit forms for the nominated Co-
Guardian are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Guardians and 
Conservators” section and click on the “Guardianships of Adults” section. 

The affidavit forms and the training course is in the “Guardian Qualifications and Training 
Requirements” section.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
