      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF A CHILD IN JUVENILE COURT 
BASED ON WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE PARENTS 

 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. If you’re unsure if these forms 
and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
process for asking a North Dakota Juvenile Court to appointment a guardian of a child because 
the parents agree in writing. There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms 
available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the forms or information provided.  Use at your own risk. 

WARNING – Guardianship appointments by a North Dakota Juvenile Court can have 
serious legal consequences for the child, the parents and the guardian.  It’s strongly 
recommended that you consult a lawyer and carefully consider all of your options 
before you represent yourself in a Juvenile Court guardianship action.

***Criminal History Background Checks*** 

All proposed guardians of children and all other adults that live, or will live, in the 
household of the proposed guardians are required to obtain a criminal history 
background check through the North Dakota Department of Human Services.  A criminal 
history doesn’t automatically disqualify the proposed guardian. 

Go to Page 24 for information about the criminal history background check process.  
(You may begin this process at any time after the petition is accepted for filing.) 

The Juvenile Court considers the criminal history of the proposed guardian and any 
other adults living in the household when deciding if appointing the proposed guardian 
is in the best interests of the child or children. 

YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS IF: 

1.  ALL of the child’s living parents consent to the Juvenile Court appointing a guardian of 

(Parents whose parental rights have been terminated by court order AREN’T 
REQUIRED to give consent.) 

their child; 
• 

AND 

2.  ALL of the child’s living parents who are required to consent will give their consent IN 
WRITING to you, the Petitioner/Co-Petitioners, becoming their child’s guardian. 

When all parents who are required to consent give their consent IN WRITING, the Juvenile 
Court MAY appoint a guardian, or co-guardians, WITHOUT an in-court hearing. 

OTHER JUVENILE COURT GUARDIANSHIP FORMS PACKETS: 

Two other forms sets are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/minor-
guardianship/juvenile-court for petitioning a North Dakota Juvenile Court to appoint you the 
guardian of a child. 

All Parents Deceased or Parental Rights Terminated forms packet: 

•  All of the child’s parents are either: 

o  Deceased; or 
o  Their parental rights were terminated by court order. 

•  The Juvenile Court may appoint a guardian, or co-guardian without an in-court hearing.

Guardianship-Parent Consent/Rev Jun 2021 

The Child is a Child in Need of Protection (CHIPS) forms packet: 

•  Requires the Petitioner/Co-Petitioners to prove the child is a child in need of protection 
before the court may appoint a guardian.  (See the instructions for the forms packet for 
a definition of “Child in Need of Protection (CHIPS)”). 

•  Requires at least one in-court hearing. 

POWERS AND DUTIES OF A GUARDIAN APPOINTED BY A 
NORTH DAKOTA JUVENILE COURT 

Before beginning this process, carefully review the powers and duties of a guardian of child. 

The powers and duties of a guardian of a child appointed by a North Dakota Juvenile Court are 
listed in Section 27-20.1-15 of the North Dakota Century Code and here. 

HELP PREPARING FORMS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). 

As a self-represented individual, you must make all decisions related to the forms, including: 

•  What words to write; and 
•  Whether the words you’ve written are sufficient or correct. 

If you’d like assistance filling out your forms, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.  Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to practice in 
North Dakota may agree to help you with part of your Juvenile Court guardianship, such as 
preparing legal documents, while you handle the rest of the case.  You and the lawyer must 
agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

A JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY HEAR AND DECIDE THE GUARDIANSHIP 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows guardianship petitions 
in Juvenile Court to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court

that a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written 
request with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the guardianship petition is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will 
issue findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the 
same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the guardianship petition wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of fact 
and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for 
the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review.

can move forward to Step 6. 

First, a Juvenile Court Director, or designee, reviews the petition for guardianship to make sure 
it includes all of the information required from Section 27-20.1-06 of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  The Director will also review the documents you filed to make sure you included an

parental consent, or any required supporting documentation, you will have 30 days to file the

or Judicial Referee reviews the petition for guardianship to make sure it complies with Section 
27-20.1-06 of the North Dakota Century Code. 

The Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee reviews the affidavit in support of the petition for 
guardianship and affidavits of parents consenting to guardianship to determine if they meet the 
requirements for the guardianship case to move forward.  

Third, the Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee will issue an order approving or denying the 
petition to move forward. 

If the order approves the petition for guardianship a summons will be issued and the case will 
move forward.

state that the guardianship may be decided without a hearing.  The summons will also 
state that the child or others may file a written objection and a demand for hearing. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides NOT to waive an in-court hearing, the summons 
will have the date, time, and location of the first hearing.

STEP EIGHT:  The Juvenile Court Decides Whether to Appoint a Guardian 

Without an In-Court Hearing. 

When all parents who are required to consent to the guardianship have consented in writing, 
the Judge or Judicial Referee may appoint a guardian without holding an in-court hearing. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee’s decision is based on a review of the documents and the 
Guardian ad Litem’s written report and recommendations. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides that the documents are sufficient and meet the 
requirements of North Dakota law, a guardian will be appointed without an in-court hearing. 

Step 10 describes what happens when a Judge or Judicial Referee makes a decision about 
whether to appoint a guardian. 

If one, or any combination, of the following occur, the Judge or Judicial Referee will schedule 
an in-court hearing: 

•  After reviewing the documents filed by the Petitioner or Co-Petitioners, the Judge or 
Judicial Referee determines the documents are insufficient to make a decision. 
•  The Guardian ad Litem’s written report indicates an in-court hearing should be held 

before appointing a guardian. 

•  A written objection and demand for hearing are filed with the Juvenile Court within 10 

days of service of the summons and petition. 

If a hearing is scheduled, prepare your case. 

You, the petitioner, must prove the allegations in your guardianship petition and the grounds 
(reasons) for the guardianship. 

Caution! Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. You are held to same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

You’ll need to conduct additional research to prepare for the hearing. 

At minimum, you’ll need to review and research the laws and rules listed in Laws and Rules 
section above. 

To research how the North Dakota Supreme Court has interpreted laws related to Juvenile 
Court proceedings, you may find the Juvenile Court Case Compendium a useful starting point.  
The Juvenile Court Case Compendium is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/legal-
research.

Subpoenas: Review Rule 13 of the North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure carefully!  If you 
require a witness to appear at a hearing or require production of documents, electronically 
stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of Court to issue a 
subpoena. Only a Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

Evidence: You are required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your 
own evidence and when objecting to the evidence presented by other parties. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

You may also wish to review the guides for self-represented individuals for gathering and 
presenting evidence at rcdvcpc.org/resources/self-represented-litigants-series.html. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library near 
you.  (www.odin.nodak.edu/) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book. 

Following are a selection of library resources on ODIN that may be of interest to you:

STEP NINE:  If the Juvenile Court Schedules an In-Court Hearing, Attend All In-

Court Hearings. 

If In-Court Hearings are Scheduled, Attend Each Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a request form is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/other-courts/juvenile-court. 

There may be more than one hearing, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.

Guardianship-Parent Consent/Rev Jun 2021 

Be prepared to prove your case at every hearing. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. See Step 8 for 
more information. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Don’t miss your hearing date and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get 
to court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the Juvenile Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The Judge, or Judicial Referee, hears both sides and then issues a final order.  Sometimes, the 
final order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final order is issued at a later date. 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the petitioner goes first. 

•  Petitioner Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The petitioner presents their case first. The respondent may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the petitioner’s evidence. 

•  Respondent Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The respondent presents their case after the petitioner.  The petitioner may 

cross-examine witnesses and object to the respondent’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Respondent goes first. 

Before You Leave the Courthouse:  

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you’re not sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP TEN:  Findings of Fact and Order and Letters of Guardianship. 

A guardian isn’t appointed until the Juvenile Court Judge or Judicial Referee issues Findings of 
Fact and Order stating that the Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence that a 
guardianship is in the child’s best interest. 

The Letters of Guardianship are proof of the appointed guardian’s authority. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Legal Self Help & Forms” 

Page 28 of 32 

Guardianship-Parent Consent/Rev Jun 2021 

THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY PREPARE THEIR OWN FINDINGS OF FACT 
AND ORDER AND LETTERS OF GUARDIANSHIP. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee prepares their own Findings of Fact and Order and 
Letters of Guardianship, you will be mailed a signed copy.  Skip Step 10 and go to 
Step 11. 

HOWEVER, YOU, THE PETITIONER, MAY BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE PROPOSED 
FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER AND LETTERS OF GUARDIANSIP FOR THE JUDGE OR 
JUDICIAL REFEREE TO SIGN. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee requires you, the Petitioner, to prepare proposed 
Findings of Fact and Order and Letters of Guardianship, complete Step 10. 

 

Proposed Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian of a Child: 

Review Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court carefully! 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that a guardianship is in the child’s best interest, and 
appoints a guardian, you, the petitioner, may be required to prepare and file the proposed 
Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian of a Child.   

The proposed Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian of a Child must also be served on 
all parties and proof of service filed with the Juvenile Court. 

Findings of fact are the Judge or Judicial Referee’s written determination of the facts made 
from the evidence presented. This explains what facts the Judge or Judicial Referee found to be 
true. 

The Order is the ruling of law made by the Judge or Judicial Referee based on, or in connection 
with, the findings of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the Judge or Judicial 
Referee found to be true. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee will decide whether the petitioner’s proposed Findings of Fact and 
Order Appointing Guardian of a Child are appropriate.  If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides 
they are appropriate, the Judge or Judicial Referee will sign and date the Findings of Fact and 
Order Appointing Guardian of a Child. 

The Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian of a Child are not official until signed and 
dated by the Judge or Judicial Referee.

•  Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian of a Child (Hearing Held) (Form: JCG 

•  Findings of Fact and Order Appointing Guardian of a Child (Hearing Waived) (Form: JCG 

Prop 2) 

Prop 3) 

Proposed Letters of Guardianship: 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee appoints a guardian, you, the petitioner, may be required to 
prepare and file the proposed letters of guardianship. 

Letters of guardianship is the document issued by the Juvenile Court that identifies the 
authority and limitations of the guardian to make decisions on behalf of the child and identifies 
any other powers or authority given to the guardian by the court. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee will decide whether the petitioner’s proposed letters of 
guardianship are appropriate.  If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides they are appropriate, the 
Judge or Judicial Referee will sign and date the letters of guardianship.  The letters of 
guardianship are not official until signed and dated by the Judge or Judicial Referee. 

The following proposed Letters of Guardianship form for this packet of forms is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/minor-guardianship/juvenile-court: 

•  Letter of Guardianship (Form: JCG Prop 4) 

(Buy several certified copies of the signed and dated letters of guardianship.  A certified copy 
has a clerk’s stamp on it stating that the document is a duplicate of the original on file with the 
Juvenile Court.  The guardian may be required to provide a certified copy of the letters of 
guardianship when dealing with schools, government agencies, and other entities.) 

STEP ELEVEN:  Appeal of the Findings of Fact and Order. 

There are two ways to request a review of a final Findings of Fact and Order in a Juvenile Court 
guardianship proceeding.  Petitioners and Respondents may use either option. 

Review of a Judicial Referee Final Findings of Fact and Order by a District Court Judge: 

If a Judicial Referee issued the final Findings of Fact and Order in a Juvenile Court guardianship, 
a party in the guardianship proceeding may file a written request for review by a District Court 
judge. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Legal Self Help & Forms” 

Page 30 of 32 

Guardianship-Parent Consent/Rev Jun 2021 

f a party decides to file a request, the written request for review must: 

•  Be filed with the Juvenile Court within seven (7) days after service of the Notice of the 

Right to Review; and 

•  State the reasons the party requests the review. 

The District Court Judge who reviews the Judicial Referee’s final Findings of Fact and Order 
may: 

•  Adopt the Judicial Referee’s findings in the final Findings of Fact and Order; 
•  Send the final Findings of Fact and Order back to the Judicial Referee for additional 

findings; or 

•  Reject the Judicial Referee’s findings in the final Findings of Fact and Order. 

o 

If the District Court Judge rejects the Judicial Referee’s findings, the Judge must 
issue their own findings of fact, with or without a hearing. 

Parties aren’t required to request a review of a Judicial Referee’s final Findings of Fact and 
Order.  A party may skip this option and appeal the final order to the North Dakota Supreme 
Court. 

Appeal a Juvenile Court Final Order to the North Dakota Supreme Court 

Petitioners and respondents may appeal a Juvenile Court final Findings of Fact and Order in a 
guardianship proceeding to the North Dakota Supreme Court. 

The Notice of Appeal must be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days 
of the final Findings of Fact and Order in the Juvenile Court guardianship proceeding. 

A guide to the North Dakota Supreme Court appeals process is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “Appeals” section and click on the “Appeal a 
District Court Decision to the Supreme Court” link. 

  I

STEP TWELVE:  Requirements After the Juvenile Court Appoints a Guardian. 

Beginning Inventory Report: 

Within 90 days of the Juvenile Court’s order appointing a guardian, the guardian must provide a 
beginning inventory report of all assets owned by the child or in which the child has an interest. 

The Beginning Inventory Report is filed with the Juvenile Court using the Juvenile Court case 
number. 

www.ndcourts.gov; “Legal Self Help & Forms” 

Page 31 of 32 

Guardianship-Parent Consent/Rev Jun 2021 

The guardian must mail a copy of the Beginning Inventory Report to the following: 

•  The child, if the child is age fourteen or older; 
•  The child's parents, unless the parents' rights have been terminated or the parents are 

deceased; and 

•  Any interested persons designated by the court in its order. 

A form and instructions for the beginning inventory report is available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/minor-guardianship. 

Guardian’s Annual Report: 

The guardian must file an annual report with the court.  The requirements of the report are in 
Section 27-20.1-15 of the North Dakota Century Code. 

The Annual Report is filed with the Juvenile Court using the Juvenile Court case number. 

The guardian must mail a copy of the Annual Report to the following: 

•  The child, if the child is age fourteen or older; 
•  The child's parents, unless the parents' rights have been terminated or the parents are 

deceased; and 

•  Any interested persons designated by the court in its order. 

A form set for the annual report is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/minor-
guardianship. 

Payment of Room and Board from Child’s Funds Not Allowed in Certain Circumstances: 

Funds from the child’s estate can’t be used to pay for the child’s room and board when room 
and board is being furnished by the guardian/co-guardian, or the guardian’s/co-guardian’s 
spouse. 

A court order is required to allow funds from the child’s estate to be used for room and board 
in these instances.  (See N.D.C.C. § 27-20.1-15(2)(b).) 

A guardian's authority and responsibility terminates upon the death, resignation, or removal of the 
guardian, or upon the minor child's death, adoption, marriage, or attainment of majority (age 18), 
but termination doesn’t affect the guardian's liability for prior acts or the guardian's obligation to 
account for funds and assets of the minor child.
