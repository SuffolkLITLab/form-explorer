      <pre>Checklist for Answering a Debt Collection Summons and Complaint 

If you have any doubts about whether it’s proper for the Plaintiff to sue you in North 
Dakota to collect a debt, consult a lawyer Immediately, and Before you serve or file any 
written response, answer, counterclaim or any other court paper. 

You must serve a copy of your answer on each Plaintiff within 21 days after the date you 
were served the summons and complaint. 

This isn’t a complete statement of the law. 

An answer is a written response by a Defendant to a civil summons and complaint. 

This is a basic checklist for answering a civil summons and complaint to collect a debt in 
North Dakota State District Court. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota 
who can agree to represent you. 

The “Answering a Summons and Complaint” section of the ND Legal Self Help Center 
webpage has more information and resources, including general-use answer forms. 

Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL) – Caution! 

This checklist may be used by a Defendant who is a human being, also known as a natural 
person. A human being can perform the functions of a lawyer for themselves at their own 
risk. This is called legal self-representation. 

This checklist can’t be used on behalf of a Defendant who is an artificial person, also known 
as an entity created by law. An artificial person includes businesses, corporations, and 
limited liability companies. In general, an artificial person can’t be represented in a North 
Dakota state district court by a non-lawyer. This is called unauthorized practice of law 
(UPL). 

If the Defendant is an artificial person, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota. Contact the State Bar Association of North Dakota Lawyer Referral Service at (866) 
450-9579. An online directory of all lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota is 
available at ndcourts.gov/lawyers.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, is a U.S. government agency that 
makes sure banks, lenders, debt collectors, and other financial companies treat you fairly. 

The CFPB webpage at consumerfinance.gov has a wide variety of helpful information and 
resources to help you decide if you’ve been treated fairly and legally by a debt collector. 

If you have a complaint against a debt collector, you may submit your complaint to the 
CFPB at consumerfinance.gov/complaint. 

Submitting a complaint with the CFPB doesn’t stop the debt collection case in North 
Dakota State District Court. 

Carefully Review the Summons and Complaint to Collect a Debt:  

Carefully read the summons, complaint, and all papers you were served (received). 

•  The summons tells you about the deadline to serve your written answer to the complaint 

to collect a debt, who to serve, and the consequences of missing the deadline.   

•  The complaint lists the claims the Plaintiff is making against you. 

Calculate Your Deadline to Answer a Civil Summons and Complaint to Collect a Debt:  

You, the Defendant, have twenty-one (21) days from the day after you were served the summons 
and copy of the complaint to respond or “answer” the complaint. Your answer must be in writing. 

See Rule 12 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for more information about timeframes 
for serving an answer. See Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for more 
information about computing your deadline to answer. 

  Date the summons and complaint were served on you, the Defendant:  

 

 

 

  Using calendar days, calculate the date your written answer must be served on the Plaintiff(s): 

 

 

 

 

  

How to Calculate: 

A.  Don’t include the date you were served; 

B.  Count ahead 21 days using calendar days. This means you count Saturdays, Sundays, 

and North Dakota state holidays; and

C.  If the 21st day lands on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, move ahead to the next 

day that isn’t a Saturday, Sunday, or North Dakota state holiday. 

Make a Copy of the Complaint to Mark-Up:  

Make at least one copy of the complaint to collect a debt. Using the checklists on the following 
pages, go through your working copy of the complaint with a pencil and make notes. Note any 
points you want to make in your answer. 

Use your marked-up copy of the complaint, and the following checklists, to help you organize and 
prepare your written answer. 

For a Plaintiff to start a civil action, they must show that North Dakota State District Courts have  

•  The North Dakota laws and/or rules that say the court can hear and make decisions 

Jurisdiction:  

1.  Subject matter jurisdiction; and 

about the case.  

2.  Personal jurisdiction. 

•  The connection the Plaintiff(s) and Defendant(s) have to North Dakota. 

(See the “Jurisdiction” section of the Guide to a Civil Action for additional information and legal 
research resources for subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.) 

  Research the laws and/or rules the Plaintiff included in their complaint. 

  Do you agree that North Dakota State District Courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the 

collection of the debt the Plaintiff claims you owe?   Yes     No 

If you don’t agree, explain why the laws and/or rules in the complaint don’t give subject 
matter jurisdiction to North Dakota State District Courts:  
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

  Do you agree that North Dakota State District Courts have personal jurisdiction over each of 

the parties in the civil action?   Yes     No 

If you don’t agree, explain why North Dakota State District Courts don’t have authority over 
each of the parties. (Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the definition of a 
“person” and the requirements for exercising personal jurisdiction over a person):

Statute of Limitations:  

Statute of limitations is the amount of time allowed by law that a Plaintiff can bring a claim in a 
civil action.  If the time has passed, the Plaintiff can’t bring the claim. 

  Start your statute of limitations legal research with Chapter 28-01 of the North Dakota Century 

Code. If the debt collection action doesn’t relate to real estate, start your research with 
Section 28-01-16. 

  The Section(s) of the North Dakota Century Code with the statute of limitation for collecting 
this debt is: ________________________________________________________ and the 
statute of limitations is ______ years. 

  Do you agree that the Plaintiff started the debt collection case within the statute of limitations 

to collect this debt?   Yes     No 

If you don’t agree, explain why the Plaintiff didn’t meet the statute of limitations to collect this 
 
debt:  
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

Venue (Location of Civil Action within North Dakota):  

The Plaintiff(s) must determine the proper county in North Dakota for the North Dakota State 
District Court to hear and decide the subject matter of the civil action. (See the laws and/or rules 
related to the subject matter and/or North Dakota Century Code Chapter 28-04.) 

  Do you agree that the North Dakota State District Court in __________________________ 
County is the proper county in North Dakota to hear and decide the subject matter of the 
action?   Yes     No 

If you don’t agree, what is the proper North Dakota county? ________________________  

Explain why: ________________________________________________________________ 
__________________________________________________________________________ 

Admit, Deny, or Insufficient Knowledge:  

For every claim in the Plaintiff’s complaint to collect a debt, your answer must either: 

1.  Admit (agree); 
2.  Deny (disagree); or 
3.  State you don’t have enough knowledge or information to admit or deny the claim. 

(See Rule 8(b) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for additional information.)

Affirmative Defenses:  

An affirmative defense is a legal reason the Plaintiff should lose, even if the Plaintiff’s claims are 
true. 

Affirmative defenses must be stated in your answer.  You may have more than one affirmative 
defense. It’s also possible you won’t have any affirmative defenses. 

You need to prove at trial all affirmative defenses you list in your answer. 

Important! Inability to pay the debt isn’t an affirmative defense.  

  Begin your research with Rule 8, Rule 9 and Rule 12 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 

Procedure for possible affirmative defenses and their requirements. 

  Do you have any affirmative defenses? 

Following are common affirmative defenses to debt collection cases. The following affirmative 
defenses aren’t all of the possible affirmative defenses. You must research affirmative 
defenses more yourself.

Filing the Answer and Confidential Information Form with the North Dakota State District Court:  

(See the “Filing Documents with the District Court” section of the Guide to a Civil Action for 
additional information, including when a Defendant can file the summons and complaint.) 

*** Filing a document isn’t the same as serving a document. Filing doesn’t meet the 
requirements for service. *** 

You must file your original answer, attachments (if any), confidential information form, and proof 
of service of the answer on each Plaintiff within a reasonable amount of time after being served 
the notice of filing the summons and complaint. 

You’ll be required to pay a filing fee.  The filing fee for an answer is $50.00. 

If you can’t afford to pay the $50.00 filing fee, you may ask to have the filing fee waived.  Forms 
and instructions are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. File the request at the 
same time your file your answer, confidential information form, and proof of service. 

You must serve notice of filing the answer on the Plaintiff.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
