except   that   the  court   below  may  proceed   upon   any  other   matter   included   in   the   action   not

the judgment or order appealed from to be sold and the proceeds paid into the court to abide 
the event.

28-27-25. Reference to ascertain damages - Breach of undertaking.
When the amount of damages to be paid by the appellant on affirmance of the judgment or 
order appealed from pursuant to an undertaking is not fixed by the judgment or decision of the 
supreme court on appeal, the district court, after the remittitur of the record from the supreme 
court is filed, may order a reference to ascertain such damages, the expense of which shall be 
included and recoverable with such damages. In all cases, a neglect for the space of thirty days 
after the affirmance on appeal of a judgment directing the payment of money to pay the amount 
directed to be paid on such affirmance must be deemed a breach of the undertaking on such 
appeal. A neglect for the space of sixty days after the confirmation of a report of a referee, to 
whom a reference has been ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the damages to be paid on 
the affirmance of any other judgment or order appealed from, to pay the amount of damages so 
ascertained, and the costs of such reference must be deemed a breach of the undertaking on 
such appeal. The dismissal of an appeal by the appellant or by the court for want of prosecution, 
unless the court at the time shall order otherwise, renders the sureties upon the undertaking or 
bond   given  under   this   chapter  liable   in  the  same  manner  and  to  the same  extent  as  if  the 
judgment or order appealed from had been affirmed.

28-27-29. Power of supreme court on appeals.
Superseded by N.D.R.App.P., Rule 35.

28-27-29.1. Orders separately reviewable on appeal.
The supreme court, without a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or a motion 
in the alternative for such judgment or for a new trial, first made in the trial court, may review the 
ruling on the motion for a directed verdict on appeal from the judgment, and may order judgment 
to be entered when it appears from the testimony that a verdict should have been so directed. It 
also may so order on appeal from an order denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the 
verdict,   or   on   appeal   from   an   order   denying   a   motion   for   judgment   in   accordance   with   the 
motion for a directed verdict if no verdict was returned. On appeal from an order made upon a 
motion in the alternative for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial, the court 
shall review the whole order and may reverse, affirm, or modify the order as to any and all 
parties.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
