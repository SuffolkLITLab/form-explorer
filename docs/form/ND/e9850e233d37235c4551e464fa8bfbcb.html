      <pre>ANSWERING A CIVIL SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT 
CHECKLIST 

If you have any doubts about whether it’s proper for the Plaintiff to sue you in North 
Dakota, consult a lawyer IMMEDIATELY, and BEFORE you serve or file any written 
response, answer, counterclaim or any other court paper. 

You must serve a copy of your answer on each Plaintiff within 21 days of service of the 
summons and complaint. 

This isn’t a complete statement of the law. 

An answer is a written response by a Defendant to a civil summons and complaint. 

This is a basic checklist for answering a civil summons and complaint in North Dakota 
State District Court. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota 
who can agree to represent you. 

The “ANSWERING A SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT” section of the ND Legal Self Help 
Center webpage has more information and resources, including general-use answer 
forms. 

UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW – CAUTION! 

This checklist may be used by a Defendant who is a natural person, also known as a human 
being.  A natural person can perform the functions of a lawyer for themselves at their own 
risk.  This is called legal self-representation. 

This checklist may not be used on behalf of a Defendant who is an artificial person, also 
known as an entity created by law.  An entity created by law includes a business, a 
corporation or a limited liability company.  In general, an artificial person can’t be 
represented in a North Dakota state district court by a non-lawyer.  This is called 
unauthorized practice of law (UPL). 

If the Defendant is an artificial person, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.  Contact the State Bar Association of North Dakota Lawyer Referral Service at 
(866) 450-9579.  An online directory of all lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota is 
available at ndcourts.gov/lawyers.

Answer Checklist/Rev Sep 2021 

Carefully Review the Summons and Complaint:  

Carefully read the summons, complaint, and all papers you were served (received). 

•  The summons provides information about the deadline to serve your written answer to the 

complaint, who to serve, and the consequences of missing the deadline. 

•  The complaint lists the claims the Plaintiff is making against you. 

Calculate the Deadline to Answer a Civil Summons and Complaint:  

You, the Defendant, have twenty-one (21) days after you’re served the summons and copy of the 
complaint to respond or “answer” the complaint.  Your answer must be in writing. 

See Rule 12 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for more information about timeframes 
for serving an answer.  See Rule 6 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for more 
information about computing time. 

  Date the summons and complaint were served on you, the Defendant: ________________ 

  Using calendar days, calculate the date your written answer must be served on the 

Plaintiff(s): ________________  

How to Calculate: 

A.  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the period (the date you were served); 

B.  Count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 

C. 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

Make a Copy of the Complaint to Mark-Up:  

Make at least one copy of the complaint.  Using the following checklists, go through your working 
copy of the complaint with a pencil and make notes.  Note any points you want to make in your 
answer. 

Use your marked-up copy of the complaint, and the following checklists, to help you organize and 
prepare your written answer.

Century Code (legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c01.html).  If the civil action doesn’t relate to real 
estate, start your research with Section 28-01-16.

action is: ________________________________________________________ and the
