Answer Brief/Dec 2021 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWER BRIEF TO MOTION FORM 

ND Legal Self Help Center Staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out forms.  If you’re 
unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer. 

There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  Use at your own risk. 

Don’t include these instruction sheets when you serve or file your completed Answer Brief. 

The “Motion” Section of the GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION on the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website has additional information and resources. 

An Answer Brief to a motion is one of a set of required documents that make up a written 
answer to a motion: 

1.  Answer Brief to Motion; 
2.  Declaration in Support of Answer Brief;  
3.  Other supporting documents; and 
4.  Notice of Hearing on Motion (if the opposing party requests a hearing). 

An Answer Brief to a motion is your required written response to the motion made by the 
moving party.  (You are the opposing party to the motion.) 

An Answer Brief responds to the facts and arguments in the Brief in support of the motion. 

An Answer Brief takes the rules and laws that support your response to the moving party’s 
request and explains how your version of the facts applies to the situation that led to the 
motion. 

Facts referred to in the Answer Brief should also appear in your declaration in support of your 
Answer Brief. 

Calculate the due date for your Answer Brief, Declaration and supporting documents.  If the 
motion was served by handing it to the opposing party, leaving it at the opposing party’s office 
or residence, the opposing party has fourteen (14) days after service of the motion documents 
to serve and file their answer to the motion in writing. 

If the motion is served by mail or third party commercial carrier, the opposing party has 
seventeen (17) days after service of the motion documents to serve and file their answer to the 
motion in writing.

Answer Brief/Rev. Apr 2022 

Review the laws and rules from the motion documents to determine if the timeframe to answer 
the motion is different. 

Research North Dakota court laws and rules.  Information and resources for legal research are 
available through the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center.  Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  
Scroll to the “Legal Research” section. 

Review the motion, brief in support of the motion, declaration in support of the motion, and 
any other supporting documents carefully! 

A motion must include the legal authority that supports the motion request.  Any motions to 
the court must refer to the laws, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and court rules, or a 
combination of all three, upon which the motion is filed.  The Brief in support of the motion 
explains how and why the law, case law, or court rule supports the moving party’s request. 

Research the laws, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and court rules the moving party 
used to make their arguments.  Try to determine if the laws and rules stand for what the 
moving party says they do. 

Conduct your own research to determine if there are other laws, North Dakota Supreme Court 
case law, and court rules that support your argument. 

  The North Dakota Century Code is available at ndlegis.gov/general-information/north-

dakota-century-code.  The Century Code contains the laws enacted by the North Dakota 
Legislature. 

  North Dakota Supreme Court case law is available at ndcourts.gov.  When the decision 
of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the North Dakota 
Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way they did.  The opinions are case 
law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and 
issues. 

  North Dakota court rules are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.  Court 
rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is conducted. 

(The North Dakota Century Code, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and North Dakota 
court rules are also found in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries.)

paragraph.

purpose, the Court could find you in contempt or you may be prosecuted for perjury. 

  The self-represented party answering the motion fills in their printed name, address, 

telephone number, and email address.  

If you have a physical address and a mailing address, type or write both addresses using

Each page of a document prepared for a guardianship case must be numbered. 

  Number each page of the completed Answer Brief. 

  The last page of the Answer Brief is the date and signature page.  

Page Numbering: 

Service: 

In general, copies of documents filed, or intended to be filed, with the Court must be provided 
to the other parties in the guardianship case.  This is called service. 

There are specific requirements for serving documents after a guardianship case has started.  
Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure gives the requirements for service after a 
civil action has started. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court won’t act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
