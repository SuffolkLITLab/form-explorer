      <pre>General Instructions for the Guardianship Annual Report  

Court employees cannot help you fill out this form. 
Do not include these instructions when you file the completed form. 

Guardians and conservators must report on the status of their ward and update the North 
Dakota State District Court with a summary of the “exercise of powers” for the past year. 

The exercise of powers means all of the ways in which a guardian or conservator has handled 
decision making on behalf of the ward. This includes all of the areas of authority that the Court 
has appointed to a guardian or conservator.  

Generally, the annual report is due to the Court each year on the anniversary of the Letters of 
Guardianship. Unless directed by the Court to report more frequently, the report should detail 
the events of the previous year. The annual report is required by law in North Dakota Century 
Code §30.1-28-12(8) and §30.1-29-19.  

North Dakota State District Courts are required to provide oversight of the wards, and these 
annual summaries supply the Court with a snapshot of the ward’s health, financial wellbeing, 
and significant changes in care or living arrangements.  These summaries also assure the Court 
that the ward is living in the least restrictive environment. 

Fillable forms are available on the North Dakota Supreme Court’s website: 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the Guardianships and Conservatorships section. 

Please add additional pages as necessary to submit a report to the Court that contains all 
relevant information on the ward’s wellbeing and activities for the past year. 

The following instructions apply to all three components of the annual report, and the website 
has further instructions for each individual component.  

Guardianship Annual Report:  

•  Purpose of Notice of Guardianship Annual Report 

1.  The notice provides the guardian or conservator with a reminder that the annual
