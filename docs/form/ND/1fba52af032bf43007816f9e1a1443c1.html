DEFINITIONS OF COMMONLY USED POWER OF ATORNEY TERMS

Attorney in Fact – The person who is given the power of attorney for financial and other 
decisions.  The Attorney in Fact isn’t required to be an actual attorney. 

Durable Power of Attorney – An instrument authorizing a person to act as the Attorney in Fact 
of the person granting the Power of Attorney.  The authority granted is for financial or other 
decisions, but doesn’t include health care decisions.   A Durable Power of Attorney remains in

(See also Power of Attorney). 

Power of Attorney – An instrument authorizing a person to act as the Attorney in Fact of the 
person granting the Power of Attorney.  The authority granted is for financial or other 
decisions, but doesn’t include health care decisions.   A Power of Attorney doesn’t remain in 
effect when the person granting the power of attorney is unable to make their own decisions.  
(See also Durable Power of Attorney). 

Principal – The adult individual who grants durable power of attorney to the Attorney in Fact. 

OVERVIEW OF POWER OF ATTORNEY 

What is a Durable Power of Attorney? 

A Power of Attorney is a document authorizing a person to act as the Attorney in Fact of the 
Principal.  A Power of Attorney ends when the Principal becomes unable to make their own 
decisions. 

A Durable Power of Attorney doesn’t end if the Principal becomes unable to make their own 
decisions.  A Durable Power of Attorney remains in effect even if the Principal becomes 
disabled or incapacitated. 

A Durable Power of Attorney is for financial or other decisions.  Heath care decisions aren’t 
authorized in a Durable Power of Attorney.  There’s a different document for health care 
decisions called a Health Care Directive. 

The Attorney in Fact must be a responsible adult, but doesn’t need to be an actual attorney. 

NDLSHC

 POA – Adult/Rev Apr 2022 

The Durable Power of Attorney may: 

1)  take effect upon the signature of the Principal and remain effective if the Principal 

becomes disabled or incapacitated; or  

2)  take effect only when the Principal becomes disabled or incapacitated. 

The Principal may revoke the Durable Power of Attorney at any time, as long as they are legally 
competent.  The revocation must be in writing. 

Is a Durable Power of Attorney a Court Order? 

No, a Durable Power of Attorney isn’t a court order, isn’t a guardianship, and isn’t a 
conservatorship. 

Neither a Power of Attorney nor a Durable Power of Attorney require a court process to create.  
So, neither a Power of Attorney nor a Durable Power of Attorney are court orders. 

Guardianships and conservatorships are court processes where a judge or judicial referee 
decides if an adult individual’s circumstances meet the requirements for appointment of a 
guardian, conservator, or both. 

When a judge or judicial referee appoints a guardian, conservator, or both, the court specifies 
in its order the decisions the guardian or conservator can make on behalf of the adult. 

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES 

A Durable Power of Attorney can have serious legal and financial consequences.  Following are 
resources to get you started on your legal research. 

Review North Dakota Century Code Chapter 30.1-30.  The link to North Dakota Century Code 
Chapter 30.1-30 is ndlegis.gov/cencode/t30-1c30.html.  Chapter 30.1-30 may also be found in 
print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Consult a lawyer.  Only a lawyer who has agreed to represent you can take your circumstances, 
apply the law and give you advice about what you should do.  Consult a lawyer for legal advice 
and carefully consider all of your options.

REVOKING THE POWER OF ATTORNEY 

You, the Principal, may revoke the General Durable Power of Attorney at any time, if you’re 
legally competent to do so.

been given a copy of the General Durable Power of Attorney form. 

If possible, you, the Principal, should collect and destroy the original Power of Attorney and all 
copies when the General Durable Power of Attorney is revoked.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
