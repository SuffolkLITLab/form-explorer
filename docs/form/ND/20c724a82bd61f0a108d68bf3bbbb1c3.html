A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide Your Petition for Termination 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows guardianship cases in 
Juvenile Court to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the guardianship case, any party to the case may request that 
a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the guardianship case is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will 
issue findings of fact and an order.  The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the 
same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded 
(replaced) by a written order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the guardianship case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of fact 
and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for 
the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review. 

The party requesting the review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

STEP SIX: Prepare Your Case 

Prepare your case for the evidentiary hearing. 

You, the petitioner (or co-petitioners), must prove what you typed or wrote in your petition for 
termination. 

Caution! Preparing for a hearing is often a complex and confusing process. You’re held to the 
same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or 
procedures. 

You’ll need to conduct additional research to prepare for the hearing. 

Subpoenas: Review Rule 13 of the North Dakota Rules of Juvenile Procedure carefully!  If you 
require a witness to appear at a hearing or require production of documents, electronically 
stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of Court to issue a 
subpoena. Only a Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

Evidence: You’re required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your 
own evidence and when objecting to the evidence presented by other parties. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

You may also wish to review the guides for self-represented individuals for gathering and 
presenting evidence at rcdvcpc.org/resources/self-represented-litigants-series.html. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library 
near you.  (www.odin.nodak.edu/) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book.

•  Represent Yourself in Court: How to Prepare & Try a Winning Case, Paul Bergman, Sara 

Institute for Trial Advocacy, c2015. 

Berman, NOLO, 2016. 

STEP SEVEN: A Hearing is Held Before the Juvenile Court Makes a Decision 

Attend the Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a request form is 
available at www.ndcourts.gov/other-courts/juvenile-court. 

There may be more than one hearing, depending on the specific circumstances of the 
case. 

Be prepared to prove your case at every hearing. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  
At minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. See 
Step 6 for more information. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

Don’t miss your hearing date and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get 
to court on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the Juvenile Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The Judge, or Judicial Referee, hears both sides and then issues a final order.  Sometimes, the 
final order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final order is issued at a later date. 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the petitioner goes first. 

•  Petitioner Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The petitioner presents their case first. The respondent may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the petitioner’s evidence.

•  Respondent Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The respondent presents their case after the petitioner.  The petitioner may 

cross-examine witnesses and object to the respondent’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Respondent goes first. 

Before You Leave the Courthouse:  

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP EIGHT: Findings of Fact and Order 

Until the judge or judicial referee signs an order stating that the guardianship is terminated and 
the guardian(s) is/are discharged, the guardianship and guardian(s) remain in place. 

After the judge or judicial referee reviews all documents filed and following the hearing, the 
judge or judicial referee will issue findings of fact and an order. 

If the order terminates the guardianship and discharges the guardian(s), the guardianship ends. 

If the order doesn’t terminate the guardianship, the guardianship remains in place. 

THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL REFEREE MAY PREPARE THEIR OWN FINDINGS OF 
FACT AND ORDER. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee prepares their own Findings of Fact and 
Order, you’ll be mailed a signed copy.  Skip Step 8. 

HOWEVER, YOU, THE PETITIONER, MAY BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE 
PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER FOR THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL 
REFEREE TO SIGN. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee requires you, the Petitioner, to prepare 
proposed Findings of Fact and Order, complete Step 8.

The petitioner or co-petitioners complete this form.

o  Read the paragraphs carefully. 
o  Complete all paragraphs that require you to type or write information. 

•  DON’T SIGN OR DATE THIS FORM!  

o

requirements to terminate the guardianship, the Judge or Judicial Referee will issue 
an order. 

o  This is your proposed order for the court to sign to terminate the guardianship and 
discharge the guardian or co-guardians.  If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides to 
use your proposed order, they will sign it. 

o  The proposed order isn’t effective until it’s signed by the court.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
