NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 1 of 6]  

Instructions/Rev Dec 2022 

Before You Start, You Must Try to Contact the Other Parties! 

Before you serve or file the Motion to Appear by Reliable Electronic Means, you must attempt 
to contact the other party (or parties) in the civil action to find out if they agree or object to 
your motion to appear by reliable electronic means. 

You can still make your motion even if you’re unable to contact the other party (or parties), 
or they object to your motion. You’ll use Form 1: Motion to tell the court if you were able to 
contact the other party (or parties) and, if so, whether they agree or disagree. 

What is a Motion to Appear by Reliable Electronic Means? 

Often, hearings and trials in civil actions are held in a courthouse. This means that all parties 
and witnesses must go to the courthouse in person for the hearing or trial. 

However, when any party, or their witness(es), has a reason (or reasons) they can’t go to the 
courthouse in person, they may ask the court for permission to appear at the hearing, trial, or 
other proceeding by reliable electronic means. 

Examples of reliable electronic means include, but aren’t limited to, Zoom, telephone, or 
Interactive Video Network (IVN). 

The court decides whether allow the party or their witness(es) to appear by reliable electronic 
means. 

Who are the Parties in this Motion? 

Plaintiff: The party (or parties) listed as the Plaintiff in the civil action. 

Defendant: The party (or parties) listed as the Defendant in the civil action. 

Moving Party: The party making the Motion to Appear by Reliable Electronic Means. In other 
words, the party who completes and signs Form 1: Motion. 

•  The Moving Party may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant in the civil action. 

Opposing Party: (Also called the Non-moving Party.)  The other party (or other parties).  In 
other words, the party or parties who didn’t bring the motion and must answer the motion. 

•  The Opposing Party may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant in the civil action.

Instructions/Rev Dec 2022 

What Are the Deadlines for this Motion? 

The Moving Party, must serve the motion documents on all other parties at least seven (7) 
days before the hearing, trial, or other proceeding. 

•  See Step 2 on Pages 5-6 for information on service. 

If the Opposing Party chooses to respond, they must serve their written response to the 
motion at least four (4) days before the hearing, trial, or other proceeding. 

•  The Opposing Party may choose not to respond. The court will make a decision based on 

the documents filed by the Moving Party.

also referred to as having good cause. 

If a Moving Party wants to make a request to shorten the time requirements, Form 1: Motion 
includes the option to make this request.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
