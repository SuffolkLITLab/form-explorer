      <pre>General Instructions for the Guardianship Annual Report  
(Minor Child Guardianships)  

Court employees can’t help you fill out this form.   
Don’t include these instructions when you file the completed form. 

Guardians and conservators of minor children must report on the status of the Child and 
update the Court with a summary of the “exercise of powers” for the past year. 

The exercise of powers means all of the ways in which a guardian or conservator has handled 
decision making on behalf of the Child. This includes all of the areas of authority that the court 
has appointed to a guardian or conservator. 

Generally, the annual report is due to the Court on the anniversary of the Letters of 
Guardianship. Unless directed by the Court to report more frequently, the report should detail 
the events of the previous year. The annual report is by the law of North Dakota in North 
Dakota Century Code § 27-20.1-15.  

North Dakota Juvenile Courts are required to provide oversight of minor children in a 
guardianship, and these annual summaries supply the Court with a snapshot of the Child’s 
health, financial wellbeing, and significant changes in care or living arrangements.  

Fillable forms with instructions are available on the North Dakota Supreme Court’s website: 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help in the Guardianships and Conservatorships section. 

Please add additional pages as necessary to submit a report to the Court that contains all 
relevant information on the Child’s wellbeing and activities for the past year. 

The following instructions apply to all three components, and the website has further 
instructions for each individual component.
