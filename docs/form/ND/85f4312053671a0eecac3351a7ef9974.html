NEW STANDARDS FOR  
PUBLIC LIBRARIES

The North Dakota State Library, in conjunction with 
the  North  Dakota  Library  Coordinating  Council, 
are  pleased  to  share  with  you  the  newly  adopted 
Standards for Public Libraries. The previous standards 
needed  to  be  updated  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  not 
least  of  all  the  high  number  of  libraries  that  were 
unable to obtain compliance. 

The  population  tiers  have  been  removed  and 
replaced  with  three  levels  for  all  libraries  regardless 
of  size:  Developing,  Excelling,  and  Future-Focused.  
We  believe  that  a  majority  of  public  libraries  will 
be  able  to  meet  the  Developing  standards.  Public  
libraries  must  be  in  compliance  with  all  of  the 
standards  at  the  Developing  level  in  order  to  be 
eligible  to  apply  for  competitive  Library  Vision 
grants. Libraries that achieve Excelling will receive a 
certificate  and  libraries  that  achieve  Future-Focused 
will receive a plaque.

We would like to thank the members of the Standards 
Task Force that assisted with the process of updating  
the standards.

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

I  was  at  an  appointment,  recently,  and  The 
Today Show was on in the waiting room. The 
hosts  were  talking  about  the  dog  days  of 
summer.  This  year,  the  dog  days  of  summer 
are  July  12-August  20.  The  term  refers  to 
the  part  of  the  summer  that  usually  has  
hot, steamy days in the Northern Hemisphere, 
which  I  knew.  What  I  didn’t  know  was  that  
the  term  goes  back  to  ancient  Greek  and 
Roman  times.  The  dog  days  of  summer 
are  associated  with  the  star  Sirius  which  is  
known as the “Dog Star” and is the brightest 
star 
in  the  constellation  Canis  Major  or  
“Large Dog.”

I first became familiar with the phrase about 
ten  years  ago  when  I  was  visiting  a  nearby 
library.  They  had  a  display  titled  “Dog  Days 
of  Summer.”  As  I  recall,  the  display  had  
books  themed  around  summer,  heat,  stars, 
and,  of  course,  our  four-legged  friends.  I 
wasn’t  familiar  with  the  term  before  then,  
but  the  display  also  included  an  explanation 
of the term. 

This  was  a  great  example  of  a  library  using 
something  ordinary  and/or  timely  to  create 
an extraordinary display. I love the cleverness 
library  displays.  Not  only  are  they  a  
of 
items  from  our 
great  way  to  showcase 
collection, but they provide an opportunity to 
showcase the cleverness and creativity of our 
staff or volunteers. 

One  of  my  favorite  displays  that 
I  saw  
recently on Facebook was the “procrastination 
display.”  It  was  an  empty  display  case  with  a 
sign that said “Our procrastination display will 
be up soon.” I think this is hilarious and clever. 

Another one I also chuckled at was “Why yes 
we  have  that  blue  book,”  and  it  contained 
books with a blue cover. 

I’ve  seen  several  displays  related  to  the 
anniversary  of  the  moon  landing.  One  I  
really 
liked  had  an  astronaut,  a  rocket,  
several  planets,  and  cut  out  stars.  The  
display  said  “Where  were  you  when  we  
landed on the moon on July 20, 1969?” Patrons 
wrote  where  they  were  and  pinned  it  to  
the display board. 

I love it when library displays take advantage 
of  current  events  like  the  moon  landing 
ones.  When  it  comes  to  subjects  for  library 
displays, the sky’s the limit. I’ve seen libraries 
that  have  included  work  from  local  artists, 
fun  plays  on  library  topics  like  the  blue 
book  one,  and  pictures  of  patron  tattoos  
tied into a program on tattoos. Displays are a 
great way to promote an upcoming program. 
They  can  include  books  and  other  materials, 
but  they  don’t  have  to.  They  can  be  located 
on  a  display  case,  the  tops  of  bookshelves, 
on string hung across the library, or any other 
way  you  can  think  of.  Look  to  Pinterest  and 
Facebook for examples of library displays that 
you can adopt. If you are not currently using 
displays  in  your  library,  you’re  really  missing 
out on a great opportunity to introduce your 
patrons to new items in the collection as well 
as  older  gems,  different  types  of  formats, 
promoting programs, and more. 

I challenge you to create a new display in the 
next  few  months  and  share  the  picture  on 
social media. Be sure to tag NDSL and/or me 
when you share your display.

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

MANGO LANGUAGES

Mango Languages is the newest database added to our online library resources. It is also one of the most 
fun and interactive databases! Mango is a language learning database that can be used on both a desktop 
and through an app. 

There are 75+ languages to choose from, but the user doesn’t have to pick only one. Multiple languages can 
be set up in the account at one time. Each language comes with a set number of units, chapters, and lessons 
that  will  take  the  user  from  the  basics  of  the  language  to  the  more  advanced  part.  Each  lesson  begins  
with  the  goals  for  the  lesson  in  both  conversation  and  grammar.  Some  languages  just  have  the  basics  
(i.e. “hello”, “my name is…”, etc.) available while others have robust units that will help you gain fluency. 
Not only does it have what you need for using the language, many languages also have specialty courses 
that give you a lesson on specific subjects like slang, superstition, or English loan words. Every language is 
different, and all lessons are learned at your own pace. 

The  second  great  part  of  Mango  languages  is  the  English  Language  Learning  courses.  When  choosing  
these courses, the user chooses what their native language is in order to learn English. The instructions, 
lesson names, and progress are all in the native language. Some of these types of courses also come with 
specialty topics that would be relevant to an English Language Learner such as texting or business English. 

Some of the native languages only have the basics in English where others have robust lessons. Keep in 
mind  that  Mango  is  always  updating  their  language  options,  lessons  in  the  current  languages,  and  the 
resources that are a part of those lessons. 

This database is available with a state or public library card. You only need your library card once to sign up 
for an account and then you can login through the app or the browser wherever you are at. It is a simple and 
convenient way to learn a language right at your fingertips. 

Visit your local public library’s website to access Mango Languages.

If you have any questions about Mango please email us at ndsltrain@nd.gov or call us at 701-328-4622.

COORDINATING COUNCIL VACANCY

The  ND  Library  Coordinating  Council  (NDLCC)  serves  as  the  State  Library’s  advisory  board.  The  NDLCC  
assists with the creation and implementation of Library Vision 2020, the awarding of LV2020 grants, and 
serves as the external database review committee. The Governor appoints NDLCC members according to 
Century Code. The State Library is accepting nominations to fill a vacancy in the Public Higher Education 
and  the  Special  Population  seats.  Both  positions  must  be  filled  by  a  practicing  North  Dakota  Librarian; 
library staff at all levels are encouraged to apply. The special population seat may be filled by a librarian  
that represents disabled, economically disadvantaged, or minority populations. 

Nominations, 
including  self-nominations,  may  be  sent  to  the  NDSL  Administrative  email  at  
ndsladmn@nd.gov  by  August  15th.  The  State  Library  will  compile  the  list  of  applicants  and  forward  it  
to  the  Governor’s  office.  Nominees  will  also  need  to  complete  an  application,  which  can  be  found  at:  
https://www.governor.nd.gov/boards/AppForm.aspx. 

This  is  an  interesting  and  exciting  opportunity  to  help  shape  library  services  in  your  state,  so  please  
consider applying. If you have questions about the NDLCC, please contact State Librarian Mary Soucie at 
(701)328-4654 or msoucie@nd.gov. 

NICHE ACADEMY
Submitted by Angie Houser

A  couple  of  months  ago,  we  spoke  about  having  a  new  database  called  Niche  Academy.  This  
database has tutorials on everything from database use to computer basics to how to be a library 
director.  If  you  haven’t  been  on  recently,  then  you  have  missed  out  on  new  courses  added  like  
using  the  Dewey  Decimal  System,  Tactics  for  Time  Management,  Getting  Started  with  Windows 
10,  and  Creating  a  Crisis  and  Communications  Plan.  All  of  these  are  available  to  you  through  
Niche Academy without having to login with a library card. Courses are continually being added so 
drop in and see what’s new.  

REMOTE HELP
Submitted by Trevor Martinson

The North Dakota State Library strives to serve all libraries across the state in a timely and efficient manner. 
Several departments, like Library Development (LD), are frequently on the road conducting site visits and 
providing assistance to libraries. However, North Dakota’s geography can sometimes be a burden, especially 
when assistance is needed immediately. Thankfully, technology is here to help.

If you ever have a pressing issue (that cannot be resolved via phone or email) and visual assistance is needed, 
LD will utilize Zoom. Zoom is a user-friendly communication platform that allows for collaboration, video 
conferencing, online meetings, webinars, etc.

With Zoom, LD can easily share their screen and walk you through the issue. This can also work vice versa: 
You  can  easily  share  your  screen  and  visually  explain  things  on  your  end.  Using  Zoom  may  particularly  
come in handy with any WordPress questions or during the Annual Report/State Aid seasons. 

More information on Zoom and how LD uses it is available at http://bit.ly/2FKxfmG

Board gaming is on the rise with all age groups. Sometimes people are unsure of where to start and how to 
find a board game that is right for them. Just as there is a book for every person, I believe that there is a game 
for them too! Board games are a great way to get people off of technology and connect face to face. This will 
help people implement that service in their libraries from inception to cataloging to inventorying to helping 
patrons select games.

JULY 2019

By Jessica Robinson

There  are  few  things  I  like  better  than  cracking 
open  a  heavy  fantasy  doorstopper  and  diving  in 
to  explore  a  new  world. This  month,  we’re  talking 
about  some  of  2019’s  hottest  and  most  highly 
anticipated  fantasy  novels.  As  usual,  I’m  going  to 
focus  on  standalones  or  the  firsts  in  a  new  series. 
Fantasy  is  definitely  a  genre  that  trades  on  lots  of 
sequels, so if you love a fantasy novel, there’s a good 
chance you’re going to get more of it later on.

Ann  Leckie’s  Imperial  Radch  trilogy  was  quality 
science  fiction,  and  Leckie  brings  the  same  talent  
in her new fantasy novel The Raven Tower, featuring 
the  city  of 
Iraden—protected  by  a  god  that  
demands  a  yearly  sacrifice  and  the  forces  that 
threaten  to  invade  it.  The  Priory  of  the  Orange 
Tree  by  Samantha  Shannon  is  the  definition  of 
a  doorstopper  at  a  little  over  800  pages  and  has 
secret mages, dragons, and a queen that’s besieged 
by  danger  around  every  corner,  especially  in  her  
own court. In addition to having a beautiful cover,  
G.  Willow  Wilson’s  The  Bird  King  is  a  fantastic  
melding  of  historical  fiction  and  fantasy,  taking 
place  on  the 
in  1491  and 
Iberian  Peninsula 
following a mapmaker who can bend reality. Louisa  
is  another  mix  of  
Morgan’s  The  Witch’s  Kind 
historical fiction and fantasy, this time set just after 
World War II in a small American coastal town and 
centered  around  two  sisters  with  strange  talents  
and  the  abandoned  baby  who  lands  on  their 
doorstop. Next, we get to one of my favorite fantasy 
authors,  the  incomparable  Guy  Gavriel  Kay  and  
his  newest  book  A  Brightness  Long  Ago,  set  in  a 
maritime  city  resembling  early  Renaissance  Italy 
and,  as  always  with  Kay,  exploring  a  huge  cast  of 
characters  as  they  navigate  a  difficult  world  of 
political strife and shifting social status.

in  Miranda 

Katharine  Duckett  puts  her  own  spin  on  The 
follows 
Tempest 
Shakespeare’s heroine into a brave new world that 
bears  a  sinister  resemblance  to  her  father’s  old 
world  when  Prospero  immediately  returns  to  his 

in  Milan,  which 

old tricks once they arrive in Milan. Jo Walton’s Lent 
is another great addition to the genre of historical 
fantasy  as  we  travel  to  15th  century  Florence  to  a 
man  who  can  literally  see  demons  all  around  him 
and who learns that this is perhaps the least of his 
gifts  when  he  discovers  a  shocking  secret  about 
his  identity.  Magic  for  Liars  by  Sarah  Gailey  has 
been  generating  great  buzz,  and  it’s  easy  to  see 
why when it follows a boozy private detective who 
hates magic to her estranged sister’s magic school 
in  order  to  investigate  a  grisly  murder.  The  Affair 
of  the  Mysterious  Letter  by  Alexis  Hall  is  a  bizarre 
and fantastical retelling of Sherlock Holmes with a 
dimension-sliding  veteran,  a  consulting  sorceress 
with a penchant for mystery and moodiness, and a 
host of supernatural creatures bent on preventing 
them from solving a simple case of blackmail. 

In  addition  to  having  a  great  title,  Suyi  Davies 
Okungbowa’s  David  Mogo,  Godhunter  has  a  
unique  premise  with  a  demigod  named  David 
Mogo  roaming  the  streets  of  Lagos  in  order  to  
hunt  down  the  pesky  gods  that  flooded  the  city  
after  a  massive  war.  Silvia  Moreno-Garcia’s  Gods 
of  Jade  and  Shadow  is  another  book  that’s  been 
getting  some  great  pre-release  buzz,  following 
a  listless  young  woman  named  Caiopea  in  the 
1920s  as  she  goes  on  a  quest  with  a  god  across 
Mexico to the Mayan underworld. R.J. Barker’s The 
Bone Ships sounds like my favorite kind of fantasy, 
with  misfit  criminals  on  a  suicide  mission  to  hunt 
down  a  beautiful  and  deadly  sea  dragon,  amidst 
an  ocean  plagued  by  pirates  and  ambitious  naval 
officers.  Finally,  we  end  out  the  month  with  a 
November  release  in  Kacen  Callender’s  Queen  of  
the  Conquered,  a  Caribbean-inspired  story  with 
a  noblewoman  whose  family  was  murdered  by 
colonizers  and  infiltrates  their  society  using  her 
secret magical powers.

Next  month,  we’ll  take  a  look  at  the  newest  and  
most  highly-anticipated  Middle  Grade  fiction,  just

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH:  
2019 YA READS
Submitted by Angie Houser

I  wanted  to  bring  in  a  newer  webinar  that  we  did 
recently  at  the  State  Library.  This  one  was  done  in  
May and it covers many of the most anticipated books 
in  the Young  Adult  field  this  summer.  The  webinar 
will go through the YA novels that have been hitting 
the  charts  since  they  were  released  and  the  novels 
that are coming out in the next few months that are 
expected to make a splash. 

The presenter is clearly passionate about reader’s advisory, and, because of that, created a fast 
paced and informative webinar.

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT:  
100 BOOKS BEFORE HIGH SCHOOL
Submitted by Abby Ebach
The  1,000  Books  Before  Kindergarten  challenge/program/goal  can  be  daunting,  so  the  Fremont 
Library  in  Illinois  started  a  100  Books  Before  High  School  program  for  grades  K–8.  In  this  program, 
children  could  sign  up  to  independently  read  100  books  before  they  started  the  9th  grade  (this  
is  about  one  book  a  month).  The  library  set  up  a  large  paper  race  track  on  the  walls  surrounding  
the  Junior  Fiction  section,  and  participants  could  watch  their  car  race  around  the  shelves  after  
every  20  books.  Participants  won  a  free  book  for  every  20  books  they  read.  This  is  a  great  way  
to  encourage  independent  reading  at  your  library.  For  more  information  on  Fremont’s  program

UNIVERSAL CLASS COURSE OF THE MONTH: 
GOAL SETTING 101
Submitted by Angie Houser

As  July  rolls  in,  many  people  at  the  State  Library  are 
starting  to  think  about  what  goals  we  would 
like  
to  accomplish  in  this  next  year.  Goals  are  not  always  an 
easy thing to set — and are even harder to achieve — so 
this  month’s  course  is  Goal  Setting  101.  This  course  will  
go  over  why  you  might  want  to  set  a  goal,  how  to  
develop  SMART  goals,  some  guidelines  to  follow,  and  so 
much more. 

Like  all  Universal  Class  courses,  this  one  can  be  taken  at  your  own  speed  and  in  your  own  time.  The  
class  will  take  about  5  hours  to  complete  and  has  15  lessons  to  go  through.  If  you  need  a  refresher  on  
goals or a starting point this is the best course for you.

All of this is available with a public or State Library card. Check out this course and more today!

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR NORTH DAKOTA 
GUARDIANSHIPS OF MINORS

Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian 
with special thanks to Sara Behrens, State Court Administration Staff Attorney

This is the tenth in a series of Flickertale articles that 
aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s legal 
reference resources.

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The Flickertale. 

WHAT IS A GUARDIANSHIP OF A MINOR?

A minor is an individual who is under 18 years of age.
A  guardianship  of  a  minor  is  a  state  court  process 
where a judge or judicial referee appoints a guardian 
to act in the place of a parent of the minor. A legal 
relationship  is  created  between  the  guardian  and 
the  minor,  allowing  the  guardian  to  care  for  and 
make decisions on behalf of the minor.

A  guardianship  does  not  terminate  or  sever  the 
parent’s parental rights.

CURRENT NORTH DAKOTA MINOR 
GUARDIANSHIP LAWS (Effective up to 7/31/19)

Currently,  there  are  two  different  state  court 
processes  to  petition  a  court  to  establish  a 
guardianship for a minor:

•  North  Dakota  State  District  Court  as  part  of 
a  probate  case  under  Chapter  30.1-27  of  the 
North Dakota Century Code; or

•  North  Dakota  Juvenile  Court  as  part  of  a 
deprivation  case  under  Chapter  27-20  of  the 
North Dakota Century Code.

Under the current laws, it is difficult to decide which 
court  is  the  appropriate  court  to  ask  to  appoint  a 
guardian of a minor.

CHANGES TO NORTH DAKOTA MINOR 
GUARDIANSHIP LAWS (Effective on 8/1/2019)

During  the  66th  Legislative  Assembly  (2019),  the 
Legislature  amended  the  current  guardianship 
of  minor  laws  and  also  enacted  new  laws.  The  

amended and newly enacted laws become effective 
on August 1, 2019.

As of August 1, 2019, there will still be two different 
state  court  processes  to  choose  from,  but  it  will 
be  much  easier  to  decide  which  court  is  the  
appropriate court to appoint a guardian of a minor.

Minor Guardianships in North Dakota State  
District Court:

As of August 1, 2019, a guardian may be appointed 
by  a  North  Dakota  State  District  Court  as  part 
of  a  probate  case  only  if  all  of  the  following  
requirements are met:

• 

• 

• 

• 

The minor’s parent is deceased and no other 
parent  is  alive,  or  if  another  parent  is  alive, 
their parental rights are terminated;

The  deceased  parent  left  a  will  and  that  will 
is  being  probated  as  part  of  a  North  Dakota 
State District Court probate case;

The deceased parent’s will named a guardian 
(or guardians) for the minor; and

The  individual  (or  individuals)  named  as 
guardian  are  willing  to  be  the  guardian  of  
the minor.

If  an  individual  named  as  guardian  in  the  will  
declines to be the guardian, or if objections to the 
guardian  are  received  within  a  specific  timeframe, 
the  District  Court  must  transfer  the  guardianship 
case to North Dakota Juvenile Court.

SB 2072 is the bill enacted during the 66th Legislative 
Assembly  (2019)  containing  the  amendments  to 
Chapter 30.1-27 of the North Dakota Century Code.  
Until  August  1,  2019,  the  amendments  to  Chapter 
30.1-27  are  only  available  at  www.legis.nd.gov  in  
the enrolled version of SB 2072.

JULY 2019

On  August  1,  2019,  the  amendments  to  Chapter 
30.1-27 will be reflected in the online North Dakota 
Century Code. 

Minor Guardianships in North Dakota 
Juvenile Court:

As of August 1, 2019, if the situation does not meet 
the requirements for appointment of a guardian as 
part of a probate case, North Dakota Juvenile Court 
may appoint a guardian of a minor.

A Juvenile Court guardianship of minor case is either 
started as a new Juvenile Court case, or is the result 
of a transfer from a District Court probate case. 

There  are  two  situations  when  a  petitioner  may 
ask  the  North  Dakota  Juvenile  Court  to  fast-track 
the  appointment  of  a  guardian  by  waiving  the  
in-court hearing:

•  All  living  parents  consent  in  writing  to  the 
appointment  of  a  specific  guardian 
(or 
guardians)  for  the  minor.  (If  a  living  parent’s 
parental  rights  are  terminated,  the  parent’s 
consent is not required.)

•  All  parents  are  either  deceased,  or  their 

parental rights are terminated.

All  other  situations  require  at  least  one  in-court 
hearing.  The  petitioner  presents  their  case  for  the 
guardianship at the in-court hearing. Parents whose 
parental rights have not been terminated have the 

right  and  opportunity  to  present  their  side  to  the 
Juvenile Court at the in-court hearing.

The  requirements  for  North  Dakota  Juvenile  Court 
guardianships of minors are contained in the newly 
enacted  Chapter  27-20.1  of  the  North  Dakota 
Century Code.

is  the  bill  enacted  during  the  66th 
SB  2073 
Legislative  Assembly 
(2019)  containing  newly 
enacted  Chapter  27-20.1  of  the  North  Dakota 
Century  Code.  Until  August  1,  2019,  Chapter  27-
20.1  is  only  available  at  www.legis.nd.gov  in  the  
enrolled version of SB 2073.

On  August  1,  2019,  the  new  Chapter  27-20.1  will  
be added to the online North Dakota Century Code.

RESOURCES THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON 
AFTER AUGUST 1, 2019

The  North  Dakota  Court  System’s  Guardianship 
Standards  Workgroup,  a  workgroup  made  up  of  a 
wide variety of guardianship practitioners, is in the 
process of creating proposed forms and instructions 
for  the  amended  and  newly  enacted  guardianship 
of minor court processes.

Many of the proposed forms and instructions will be 
available on the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center 
website soon after August 1, 2019.
