WEBSITE VISITS

VOLUME 48 ∙ NUMBER 12 ∙ DECEMBER 2018

When you begin your Public Library Survey (annual 
report)  next  month,  for  the  first  time  you  will  be 
asked  to  provide  data  on  your  Website  Visits.  Here 
is some more information and ample reasons not to 
panic about this:

•	 Definition:  Visits  represent  the  annual  number 
of  sessions  initiated  by  all  users  from  inside  or 
outside  the  library  to  the  library  website.  The 
library  website  consists  of  all  webpages  under 
the library’s domain. A website “visit” or “session” 
occurs  when  a  user  connects  to  the  library’s 
website  for  any  length  of  time  or  purpose, 
regardless  of  the  number  of  pages  or  elements 
viewed.  Usage  of  library  social  media  accounts 
(e.g.,  Facebook,  Twitter,  etc.)  should  not  be 
reported here.

•	 Timeline:  The  data  reported  for  2018  will  be 
considered  trial  data  and  will  not  be  published. 
The  data  reported  for  2019  similarly  will  not  be 
published. The data collected at the outset of 2021 
reflecting  2020  usage  will  be  the  first  published 
set of this data. 

•	 Support:  Guidance  on  getting  your  website’s 
analytics can be found on our Publications page:

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

There  are  many  such  serendipitous  moments  that 
provide  us  with  the  opportunity  to  tell  one  of  our 
library’s  many  stories.  I  remember  a  few  years  back 
conversing with Greta G. when she was the director of 
the Leach Public Library in Wahpeton about the library’s 
3D printer. Through a casual conversation at Rotary— 
where she was able to share that the library wanted a 
printer and why— a fellow Rotarian was able to provide 
funding from a different organization that he belonged 
to for the purposes of purchasing the printer. Another 
example of Grassroots advocacy was when the Minot 
Public  Library  staff  reached  out  to  a  local  legislator  
after  he  asked  me  during  my  budget  testimony  why 
libraries  exist  today  when  you  can  do  everything 
on  your  phone.    The  director  of  the  Minot  Library, 
along  with  a  number  of  the  staff,  reached  out  to  the 
legislator and shared information about the library, its 
programs and services, and the various ways it serves 
the community. 

Advocacy is everything from those conversations with 
legislators and local funders to the annual report that 
you present to the community and funders about the 
difference  your  library  made  in  the  community  that 
year.  It  includes  inviting  the  Mayor  to  do  a  storytime 
or attending City Council meetings, even when you’re 
not presenting anything. Advocacy can and should be 
done by library staff from all areas of the organization. 

The  North  Dakota  Library  Association  (NDLA)  will  be 
having a “Day at the Capitol” on April 1. It is an excellent 
opportunity  for  you  to  practice  those  advocacy  skills 
by  joining  Legislative  Committee  Chairs  Christine 
and  Janet  at  the  event.  Watch  the  NDLA  Newsletter, 
Facebook page and mail list for more information. The 
State Library’s Renewal and Development Conference 
will  be  held  April  1-2,  providing  an  opportunity  to 
participate in the NDLA Advocacy event. NDSL staff will 
be providing shuttle service between the hotel and the 
capitol so that many librarians will be able to join NDLA 
in advocating for our libraries. 

I wish all of you a very happy, healthy, and wonderful 
New Year filled with wonderful books, lots of adventures, 
and  a  multitude  of  opportunities  to  advocate  for 
libraries everywhere - especially your own library. 

December ushers in winter, the holiday season and the 
end of the year. It is a time when many of us reflect on 
the gifts that we’ve been given and set resolutions for 
the New Year. I invite you to set a goal for 2019 of being 
a more active advocate for your library. As we head into 
another legislative session, it’s an ideal time to reflect 
on ways to improve or increase your advocacy efforts.

dvocacy  does  not  need  to  be  scary  or  super  formal, 
although,  of  course,  it  sometimes  is  both  of  those 
things. I define advocacy as an opportunity to promote 
the library and all the wonderful services and programs 
that you offer. It can take the form of that two-minute 
“elevator  speech”  that  we’ve  all  been  encouraged  to 
develop for whenever the opportunity presents itself. 
I  think  this  is  a  great  idea  and  you  should  certainly 
think about ways that your library is important to the 
community that you serve. 

  A

Advocacy  can  be  planned,  but  it  can  also  be  on-the-
spot. Earlier this year, I was stranded overnight at the 
Minneapolis  airport.  Congressman  Cramer  was  also 
at  the  airport  along  with  State  Senator  Dever.  I  had 
an  opportunity  to  chat  with  both  of  them.  I  thanked 
Congressman  Cramer  for  supporting  North  Dakota 
Libraries by signing the “Dear Appropriator Letter” for 
LSTA  and  for  sending  a  letter  of  support  for  IAL.  We 
had  a  few  moments  to  chat  about  libraries  in  North 
Dakota.  Senator  Dever  was  part  of  a  group  returning 
from Washington, D.C., where they were part of a task 
force working on the opioid crisis. I had an opportunity 
to  share  with  him  how  our  North  Dakota  Public 
Libraries were responding to the crisis, with a number 
of our larger libraries having Narcan available and staff 
trained  in  how  to  use  it.  We  also  talked  about  some 
of  the  other  social  welfare  issues  that  libraries  were 
impacting through programs, services, and education. 
It was a great opportunity to advocate for our libraries 
and to share information that the Senator didn’t have 
about  our  libraries.  Senator  Dever  was  very  engaged 
and asked some excellent questions, and it was a rather 
enjoyable conversation even though it was about such 
a  serious  topic.  I  appreciate  both  of  our  legislators 
taking  the  time  to  chat  with  me  about  our  awesome 
North Dakota libraries!

ONLINE LIBRARY RESOURCE

SCIENCE REFERENCE CENTER

Science  Reference  Center  is  our  database  geared  towards  the  scientist  in  all 
students. Specifically designed for junior and senior high students, it uses an 
eye-catching  interface  to  attract  different  scientific  interests.  Students  can 
choose  the  type  of  science  they  are  most  interested  in  and  learn  through 
articles geared towards it. 

A  student  can  browse  by  different  scientific  categories.  In  each  category,  they  can  focus  their 
research by choosing an option that has to do with the top category they chose. The database is full 
of scientific articles that can be organized through full-text and scholarly reviewed resources. These 
resources provide real-world examples to the research that the student is doing. Science Reference 
Center contains a wealth of informational text that will help students navigate through scientific 
research without being overwhelmed.

2019 DAY @ THE CAPITOL

2019  is  almost  here  and  the  NDLA  Legislative  Committee  has 
started	 to	 plan	 its	 activities	 for	 the	 66th	 Legislative	 Assembly.	
The	 Day	 @	 the	 Capitol	 event	 is	 scheduled	 to	 take	 place	 at	 the	
Capitol  building  in  Memorial  Hall  on  Monday,  April  1st,  and 
volunteers will be needed from 9:00am-1:00pm. Thanks to the 
ND State Library, our event will coincide with the 2019 Renewal 
&  Development  Conference.  Conference  participants  will  have 
the	opportunity	to	take	part	in	the	Day	@	the	Capitol	event,	and	
the ND State Library staff has generously offered to drive people 
to the Capitol and back to the conference site. 

Communicating	with	our	legislators	is	essential.	The	Day	@	the	Capitol	event	affords	us	a	time	and	place	
to connect with them on site and in person when they are making decisions, voting on bills, and creating 
budgets that affect our libraries and communities. At this event, we have a table set up with the much-
loved prize wheel - this allows for interactive fun, prizes, and time inbetween to share information about 
the importance of libraries. We also have library statistics and information available, and library swag for 
giveaway. 

Some legislators are running from one committee meeting to another and may have only a few seconds to 
spare, while others may be inbetween commitments and have more time to chat. Either way, the important 
thing is that they see us there and we connect with them, even if it’s only a quick wave and a “thank you for 
supporting ND libraries!” as they run down the hall. Getting to know our legislators and taking part in our 
state’s political process is great experience. We hope you consider signing up for this opportunity!

Note: Sign-up for this event will be a part of registration for the Renewal and Development Conference.

DO YOUR PATRONS NEED LARGE PRINT?

Does your library serve patrons who need large print and your budget won’t allow purchasing many large 
print books?  The North Dakota State Library can send you large print books out of our collection that you 
can circulate to your patrons who need them.  In order to get set up, contact our Reference Department 
at 1-800-472-2104 or statelib@nd.gov, and let us know how many titles and which genres you wish to be 
included.  For example, you can ask us to send 5 westerns, 5 clean romances, 5 mysteries/suspense, and 5 
Christian “Amish” books.  We try not to send books in the middle of series, but we may send one that is the 
first in a series.  If your large print reader wants other books in the series, we will try to accommodate them.

Our staff will go into our large print stacks and find the books in the genres you want.  Our large print books 
check out for eight weeks.  After the eight weeks are up, simply box them up and mail them back. You can 
put your request for the next round of books right in the box!  We cannot use the FREE MATTER FOR THE 
BLIND AND HANDICAPPED postage for books being mailed to an institution. 

If you have any questions, or want to get started, please contact us at 1-800-472-2104 or statelib@nd.gov.

LUNCH WITH THE STATE LIBRARIAN

She is soliciting suggestions for topics for future sessions from anyone who has an idea. Email, tweet, 
or Facebook message topic ideas to Mary. 

DO YOU KNOW THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY PRESS?
Submitted by Kristen Northrup

When  is  a  North  Dakota  state  document  not  really  a 
document?  When  it’s  the  latest  book  from  the  North 
Dakota  State  University  Press.  Formerly  known  as  the 
Institute  for  Regional  Studies,  the  press  changed  its 
name  as  it  expanded  into  fiction  and  poetry.  Their 
most  recent  releases  are  a  book  of  poetry  about 
Norwegian  women  settlers  in  Dakota  territory,  a  teen 
book  about  a  young  woman  visiting  her  family  at 
the  Turtle  Mountain  Reservation  for  the  first  time,  a 
history  of  the  blizzards  of  1949,  and  a  compilation  of  
Thomas Isern’s pieces on Prairie Public Radio. 

Past titles checked out most frequently from the State Library include local hiking and gardening guides 
and a biography of Herman Stern, a North Dakota clothier who rescued more than 100 German Jews at the 
beginning of the Holocaust.

DECEMBER 2018

By Jessica Robinson

This  year  has  been  a  wild  and  sometimes 
contentious  year  for  books.  For  the  first  time  
since 1949 the Nobel Prize for Literature will not  
be awarded due to a number of scandals surrounding 
the Swedish Academy. However, the Nobel Prize is  
not  the  only  major  award  a  book  can  receive, 
and this month, we’ll take a look at some of most 
critically-acclaimed novels of 2018 in both literary 
and genre fiction.

The Man Booker, which is awarded to an original 
novel in English, went to Anna Burns for Milkman, a 
book which features unnamed characters in what is 
heavily implied, but never stated, to be Belfast in the 
1970s. The  Man  Booker  International  Prize  went 
to Olga Tokarczuk’s Flights, a curious collection of 
essays, short stories, and facts that loosely concern 
ideas of travel, time, and anatomy.

The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction went to Andrew Sean 
Greer for LESS, a satirical love story about a failed 
novelist on the cusp of fifty who receives a wedding 
invitation  from  his  ex-boyfriend  and  decides  that 
running  away  on  a  wild  literary  trip  around  the 
world would be less awkward than saying yes or no. 
Another unexpected invitation kicks off the Baileys 
Women’s Prize for Fiction winner Kamila Shamsie’s 
Home Fire when Isma accepts an invitation to travel 
to America and co-author a paper with her mentor 
after  years  of  caring  for  her  younger  siblings  in 
London  in  the  wake  of  their  mother’s  death  and 
their jihadist father’s disappearance.

The  National  Book  Award  for  Fiction  went  to  
Sigrid  Nunez  for  The  Friend,  a  complicated  and 
moving  story  about  the  friendship  between  a  
grief-stricken  woman  and  the  Great  Dane  her  
best friend left behind when she died unexpectedly. 
Another  story  dealing  with  loss  and  loneliness 
is  Nina  LaCour’s  We Are  Okay,  the  winner  of  the 
Michael  L.  Printz Award  for  Excellence  in Young 
Adult  Literature,  where  a  young  woman  named 
Marin  has  to  deal  with  the  life  she  abandoned  
when her best friend comes to visit her in college.

When  looking  at  the  shortlists  for  genre  awards, 
it’s  no  surprise  that  the  same  names  can  show 
up  on  more  than  one  list  in  the  same  genre.  
Therefore,  it  couldn’t  have  been  that  much  of  a 
shock when N.K. Jemisin’s The Stone Sky won both 
the Hugo and the Nebula Awards, celebrating the 
best in science fiction and fantasy. The Stone Sky is 
the third and final book in Jemisin’s post-apocalyptic 
trilogy  The  Broken  Earth.  Both  of  the  previous  
novels won the Hugo Award in their years. 

Another  genre  award  is  the  Edgar  Award  for 
Best Novel, named for Edgar Allan Poe and given 
to  the  best  in  the  mystery  genre.  2018’s  winner 
was  Bluebird,  Bluebird  by Attica  Locke—described  
as a rural noir novel set in East Texas and featuring 
a black Texas Ranger who has to solve the murders 
of a black Chicago lawyer and a local white woman 
before racial tensions tear a small town apart. 

The  Christy Awards  were  established  in  1999  to 
recognize  excellence  in  Christian  fiction—named 
after  the  main  character  in  Catherine  Marshall’s 
breakaway  historical  hit  Christy—and  2018’s 
Book of the Year was True to You by Becky Wade, 
which  also  won  in  the  Contemporary  Romance  
category.  Readers  looking  for  more  romance 
would  do  well  to  check  out  the  winners  of  
the RITA Award, which celebrates the many flavors 
of romance novels and covers so many subgenres 
that  discussing  them  all  would  be  an  article  all  
by itself.

As we finish our final pages for our 2018 reading 
goals, let’s take a moment to reflect on all of the  
great  books  that  came  out  this  year,  then  get  
excited!  2019  is  just  around  the  corner,  and  the 
publishing  world  is  already  promising  us  some 
fantastic  new  titles  and  authors,  all  ready  to 
welcome in the new year.

We don’t have large budgets. We don’t have large staffs. We might have to spend parts of our day shoveling 
the sidewalks or cleaning up a mess in the restroom. In spite of this, small and rural libraries have the 
power to be great.  We can do simple, practical things that can instantly make a difference. From internal 
customer service tips to tech tools you can’t live without, linking these 30 things will help make your small 
library extraordinary.

dancing, provide snacks, do a craft, and even have a balloon drop to celebrate and welcome in the 
new year together.

COPYRIGHT FOR TEACHERS
Submitted by Shari Mosser

Copyright 
is  a  protection  guaranteed  by  the 
Constitution.  This  protection  is  granted  to  people 
who  create  so  they  have  control  over  how  their 
work is used for a limited amount of time. You might 
find that your students are already familiar with this 
as they’ve heard about music and movie piracy for 
a good portion of their lives. But even if an item is 
protected  by  copyright  (and  you  need  to  assume 
EVERYTHING is protected), educators and students 
still have ways to use the material.

Fair  Use  is  a  protection  built  into  the  Copyright 
Act  that  allows  certain  uses  of  protected  works 
without  permission  of  the  copyright  owners.  This 
is  what  allows  scholarship,  review,  commentary 
or  criticism  of  works.  But  you  can  still  be  sued!  
Fair use is considered on a case-by-case basis using 
four factors.

The first factor is the Purpose and Character of the 
Use  –  This  is  the  only  factor  that  deals  with  the 
proposed use. This is where you examine if you are 
going  to  use  the  item  for  criticism,  comment,  etc. 
Non-profit use also favors for fair use. So, for-profit 
education is in a bit of a sticky place.

The second factor is Nature of the Copyrighted Work. 
One element of this is whether the work is published 
or not. Another element is whether the work is more 
factual  or  more  creative.  Borrowing  from  a  factual 
work  is  more  likely  to  be  fair  than  borrowing  from 
a creative work. This is because copyright does not 
protect facts and data. So, a textbook is more factual 
(and easier to prove fair use on) than a novel.

Factor  three  is  Amount  and  Substantiality  of  the 
Portion  Used  in  Relationship  to  the  Whole.  Now  
this  is  the  element  where  a  lot  of  bad  advice  is  
given.  There  is  no  mathematical  guideline  of  how 
much  an  item  can  be  used  to  still  be  covered  by  
fair  use.  The  “ten  percent”  rule  doesn’t  exist.  The 
amount  used  is  proportional.  Using  250  words  of 
a 300 word poem is probably going to be frowned 
upon.  Where  250  words  out  of  a  many  thousand  
word  article  would  be  looked  upon  as  being  
more  fair.  The  second  element  of  factor  three  is 
substantiality which asks whether you are using the 
heart  of  the  work.  So,  the  hook  of  a  song  is  more 
important than other parts of a song. The climax of 
the book is going to weigh heavily against fair use 
more than other parts of the book would.

The fourth and final factor is Effect of the Use on the 
Potential Market Value. This one is a bit tricky. It is asking 
the user of the work to analyze existing and potential 
markets for the work. Then, the user gets to predict 
the effect their use will have on those markets. More 
simply, will your use take away the sale of the item?  
For example, you have a class of twenty students. If 
you  buy  one  workbook  and  make  nineteen  copies 
that  would  be  illegal  since  you  are  taking  away 
nineteen sales. 

And now for the disclaimer – I am not a lawyer and 
this  does  not  constitute  legal  advice.  Do  you  have 
other  questions  about  copyright?  Contact  Shari  at 
ssandwick@nd.gov. Maybe your question could lead 
to another article!

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR THE NORTH DAKOTA CONSTITUTION 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This is the third in a series of Flickertale articles that 
aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s legal 
reference resources.

Pocket Parts

See the October 2018 Flickertale for the first article 
in the series, North Dakota Legal Research Resources 
in  a  Nutshell.  See  the  November  2018  Flickertale 
for  the  second  article  in  the  series,  Primary  and 
Secondary Legal Research Resources.

Next month’s article will get into more detail about 
legal  research  resources  for  the  North  Dakota 
Century  Code,  which  are  the  laws,  or  statutes, 
created by the North Dakota State Legislature.

WHAT IS THE NORTH DAKOTA CONSTITUTION?

The  North  Dakota  Constitution  is  North  Dakota’s 
founding  document  that  tells  the  three  branches 
of  government  the  authority  each  branch  has  to 
create new law. The North Dakota Constitution also 
outlines the basic rights of North Dakotans.

The  North  Dakota  Constitution  is  the  highest  law 
within  the  boundaries  of  the  state.  The  United 
States  Constitution,  however,  is  the  supreme  law 
of  the  United  States,  and  is  higher  than  the  North 
Dakota Constitution. The laws created by each of the 
three North Dakota branches of government cannot 
conflict  with  the  North  Dakota  Constitution  or  the 
United States Constitution.

The  North  Dakota  Constitution  may  be  amended 
by the North Dakota State Legislature and by North 
Dakota state voters.

THE  NORTH  DAKOTA  CONSTITUTION  PRINT 
RESEARCH RESOURCE:

The North Dakota Constitution is available in print in 
Volume 13A of the North Dakota Century Code.

Volume 13A is a handy starting point for research. It 
contains the text of the North Dakota Constitution, 
the  date  each  Section  of  the  Constitution  was 
enacted,  any  amendment  dates,  any  case  law 
interpreting the Section, and references to a variety 
of other secondary sources for legal research.

Volume  13A  is  not  reprinted  every  time  the  North 
Dakota  Constitution  is  amended  or  every  time  the 
Supreme Court interprets the Constitution in a court 
opinion. Instead, a supplement is printed and tucked 
into the back cover. This is called a pocket part or a 
pocket supplement.

A  patron  should  always  check  the  pocket  part  for 
any updated amendments and court opinions since 
Volume 13A was printed in hardcover.

Dates  of  Enactment  and  Amendment  (Source 
section)

Directly  following  the  text  of  each  Section  of  the 
Constitution,  Volume  13A  lists  the  source  of  the 
Section,  which  shows  the  date  the  Section  was 
enacted and any amendment dates.

Case Law (Listed after the Source section)

When a North Dakota state district court interprets 
what the North Dakota Constitution means, and that 
decision  is  appealed,  the  North  Dakota  Supreme 
Court reviews the district court decision. Then, the 
Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how 
and why they interpreted the Constitution to decide 
the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case 
law and are followed by North Dakota state courts 
deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.

Case  law  is  a  very  useful  resource  for  researching 
what  a  particular  Section  of  the  North  Dakota 
Constitution  means.  The  North  Dakota  Supreme 
Court  regularly  interprets  what  the  North  Dakota 
Constitution  means  as  part  of  deciding  appeals  in 
civil and criminal cases. 

If a Section of the Constitution has related case law, 
Volume  13A  includes  snapshots  of  the  opinions 
directly following the Source section.

READERS’ ADVISORY: YOU CAN’T READ IT ALL AND YOU DON’T HAVE TO!
Submitted by C.L. Quillen, Director of the Spotswood Public Library in NJ

ost librarians know to ask readers who are looking for book recommendations to tell them about a book 
they have enjoyed. This is a really useful question because it gives you some idea about how the reader 
talks about books, so that you can use some of the same language when making your suggestions; it also 
gives the librarian a chance to take a deep breath and let go of the fear. Even after almost twenty years of 
doing readers advisory, I still forget everything I ever read when someone approaches the desk to ask for a 
good book. This intro question gives me a minute to reflect and make some connections.

he next thing to find out from your reader is what they’re looking for now. More than likely when you ask 
someone about a book they’ve read and enjoyed, they will either tell you about the last book that they 
read or their favorite book of all time. But they may not want something like that again or they may want 
something exactly like that, and you need to know before you can make suggestions. If they’re still coming 
down off the high they experienced from a really good book, they may want to go in a different direction 
and sometimes that direction will surprise you. I personally read a lot of romance and women’s fiction, but 
I love thrillers and could read a novel about serial killers just about any day of the week. 

ou  really  do  need  to  know  your  collection,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  reading  every  book.  Put  together 
displays and do them on a variety of topics. This will help when someone comes to the desk and asks for a 
suggestion. When you have downtime, and I know that can be infrequent in small libraries, look through 
your collection. Make note of the midlist authors who are popular. You may even want to keep a current 
list somewhere that’s easy to access of 3-5 books in several genres, so that you have some go-to titles to 
recommend when someone is asking for something new to read. 

e  honest  with  your  readers  --  let  them  know  if  you  haven’t  read  the  book,  but  give  them  some  idea 
of  why  you’re  recommending  it  to  them.Did  you  read  a  review?  Did  someone  else  say  good  things  
about  it?  Is  the  author  who  blurbed  it,  someone  they  mentioned  as  a  favorite  author?  In  some  cases 
knowing that you haven’t read the book makes it easier for your reader if they don’t take it home because 
they don’t feel like they’re hurting your feelings. Always give them several books to take or choose from. 
There is nothing worse than going home with just one book and discovering that you’ve already read it or 
that you hate the author’s style. 

. L. Quillen is the director of the Spotswood Public Library in NJ. She is also the co-author of Read On… 

Romance and a reviewer for Booklist. She is currently reading One Day in December by Josie Silver.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
