      <pre>READ BEFORE COMPLETING THE PROPOSED AMENDED ORDER FOR 
JUDGMENT GENERAL-USE TEMPLATE (FAMILY LAW CASE) 

This General-Use template may be used to create your proposed Amended Order for 
Judgment when making a motion to modify a judgment in a family law case.  

To complete this general-use template: 

1) 

Refer to the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order for Judgment you want 
the Court to amend. 

2)  When you come to the paragraphs you want the Court to amend, write the EXACT 

paragraph number so the Court can easily identify the paragraph. 

3) 

4) 

If you want to delete words from the paragraph, write the words EXACTLY as they 
appear, then cross through the words. 

If you are asking the court to add new paragraphs, copy and underline the EXACT 
wording of each NEW paragraph you want to add. 

You have two options to create your proposed amended order for judgment: 

Option One: Use this fillable form as is.  This form includes 4 blank pages in which you may type the 
words and formatting of your proposed amended order for judgment, including paragraph numbers.  
It also includes pages to add missing provisions of your parenting plan or child tax exemption.  If your 
proposed amended order for judgment does not fit within the existing pages, use Option Two. 

CAUTION: The ND Legal Self Help Center webpage DOES NOT automatically save what you’ve 
typed into a form.  Remember to save the form as you go, so you don’t lose what you’ve 
typed. 

Option Two: Use a word processing program.  Use a word processing program, such as Microsoft 
Word, WordPerfect, Google Docs, or OpenOffice, to type the words and formatting of your proposed 
order for amended judgment, including paragraph numbers. 

Copy and paste the ENTIRE first page of this form, EXCEPT the italicized paragraphs in (parentheses), 
into the first page of your document.  Then, using the words and formatting from the rest of the 
form, type the words and formatting of your proposed amended order for judgment, including 
paragraph numbers.  Include the Clerk of Court date and signature block at the end. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure the formatting of the words you copied and pasted are the same as 
the formatting in the amended order for judgment general use template. 

Do not include this cover sheet when you serve or file the completed form.

  Parenting Plan Section.  Review the parenting plan in the judgment you are asking the 
Court to modify.  In any motion to modify parenting time in a judgment, a parenting 
plan must be included as part of an amended judgment.

Order to Amend F.L./Nov 2019 

The parenting plan must include, at minimum, the following 7 provisions: 

1.  Decision making responsibility for day to day decisions and major decisions such 

as education, health care and spiritual development. 

2.  Information sharing and access, including telephone and electronic access. 
3.  Legal residence of each child for school attendance. 
4.  Residential responsibility, parenting time, and parenting schedule for holidays, 
days off from school, birthdays, vacation planning, weekends, weekdays, and 
summers. 

5.  Transportation and exchange of the child, considering the safety of the parties. 
6.  Procedure for review and adjustment of the plan. 
7.  Methods for resolving disputes. 

The judgment must also identify the parent who may claim each child as a dependent 
for filing income taxes. 

If the parenting plan in the judgment you are asking the Court to modify does not 
include all 7 provisions, or identify the child tax exemption, add each missing provision 
to your proposed Order to Amend. 

Judge’s Signature Block: 

  Fill in the number of the Order for _________Amended Judgment (i.e., First, Second). 

  Fill in the number of the Order for (Let the _________ Amended Judgment) (i.e., First, 

Second). 

**DO NOT sign and date the (proposed) order to amend judgment.  If the court grants 
your motion, and uses your proposed order to amend judgment, the judicial officer 
assigned to your case will sign and date the order.  The proposed order to amend 
judgment is not effective until it is signed and dated by the judicial officer. 

Page Numbering: 

The pages of documents prepared for a civil action must be numbered. 

First: If you did not use paragraph 2, 3 or 4 for your (proposed) order to amend judgment, 
remove the unused page or pages. 

If you did not use the paragraphs to add provisions related to decision making, information 
sharing, legal residence of the child(ren) for school attendant, parenting time (visitation) 
schedule, transportation and exchange arrangements, procedure for review of the parenting 
plan, dispute resolution, and child tax deduction, remove the unused pages.

Order to Amend F.L./Nov 2019 

Second: Using the page numbering at the bottom of each page, number the pages of your 
(proposed) order to amend judgment.   

•  Count the total number of pages. 

•  Fill in the total number of pages in the second blank space of the page number on each 

page. 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the second blank space of the page 

number will look like this: “Page ___ of 4.” 

•  Now fill in the first blank space of the page number on each page. 

o  Fill in “1” in the first blank space of the page number on the first page. 

o  Fill in “2” in the first blank space of the page number on the second page. 

o  And so on for each page of your proposed order to amend. 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the page number on each consecutive 

page will look like this: “Page 1 of 4,” “Page 2 of 4,” “Page 3 of 4,” “Page 4 of 4.” 

Service: 

In general, copies of documents filed, or intended to file, with the court must be provided to 
the other parties in the civil action.  This is called service.  This includes serving the proposed 
Order to Amend. 

There are specific requirements for serving documents.  Rule 4 and Rule 5 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Civil Procedure give the requirements for service in a civil action. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed. 

For information about service and proof of service in a civil action, go to the Service link on the 
ND Legal Self Help Center website.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
