What is a Conservatorship? 

A conservatorship is a court process where a North Dakota state district court judge or judicial 
referee decides whether an individual is unable to manage their property or financial affairs (or 
both) to the point where a conservator must be appointed to take either limited or full control. 

The conservator can be an individual, or individuals, or a business entity, such as a bank.  

Who May Use This Set of Forms to Bring a Conservatorship Case? 

This set of forms may be used when a minor child has property or financial affairs (or both) 
that the child can’t manage on their own ONLY because the child is under 18 years old. (A 
minor child is under 18 years old.) 

If you’re one of the following, you may bring the conservatorship case (also called Petitioner): 

•  The minor child’s parent, or parents. 
•  The minor child’s guardian. A guardian is appointed by a court to act in the place of the 

minor child’s parents. 

•  The minor child’s custodian. (Custodian isn’t specifically defined for conservatorships in 
North Dakota law. You may wish to start your legal research with N.D.C.C. Chapter 47-
24.1 Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, or consult a lawyer for assistance.) 

•  Any person who is interested in the estate, affairs, or welfare of the minor child. 
•  Any person who would be adversely affected by lack of effective management of the 

property or financial affairs of the minor child. 

If the judge or judicial referee assigned to the conservatorship case decides, based on the 
evidence presented, that the minor child in under 18 years old AND: 

•  Owns money or property that requires management or protection that requires a 

•  Has or may have business affairs which may be jeopardized or prevented by the minor 

conservator to be appointed; or 

child’s age; or 

•  Needs funds for the minor child’s support and education and protection is necessary or 

desirable to get or provide the funds, 

the judge or judicial referee will appoint a conservator, or co-conservators. After appointment, 
the minor child is usually called the protected person. 

The conservatorship automatically ends when the child turns 18 years old.

Laws and Rules 

The requirements for conservatorships are found in North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.) 
Chapter 30.1-01, Chapter 30.1-03, Chapter 30.1-26 and Chapter 30.1-29. Refer to these 
Chapters when filling out the forms. 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows a District Court 
Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge, to hear and decide conservatorship cases. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice. Legal advice includes interpreting how laws and rules apply to your situation. 

A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide the Conservatorship Case 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows conservatorship cases 
to be heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, rather than a District Court Judge. 

A Judicial Referee is a judicial officer, appointed by the presiding District Court Judge, who has 
the authority to hear and decide conservatorship cases. 

If a Judicial Referee is assigned to the conservatorship case, any party to the case may request 
that a District Court Judge hear and decide the case instead. The party must file a written 
request with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the conservatorship case is heard and decided by a Judicial Referee, the Judicial Referee will 
issue findings of fact and an order. The Judicial Referee’s findings of fact and order have the 
same effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court Judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court Judge. 

If any party to the conservatorship case wants a review of the Judicial Referee’s findings of fact 
and order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for 
the review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review.  

The party requesting review must give notice of their request to all other parties. Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

Eight Steps to Establish a Conservatorship of a Minor Child Because 
the Child is Under 18 Years Old 

Step 1 – Gather the information needed to complete the forms. 

First, review N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-03 to decide where to file the petition. This is called venue. 

Second, review N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-04 and the Petition for Appointment of a Conservator/Co-
Conservators for a Minor Child (Child Under 18 Years Old) form for information that must be 
included in the petition. At minimum, gather the following: 

• 
• 

Information about the minor child; 
Information about the minor child’s property with an estimate of the property’s value, 
including any compensation, insurance, pension, or allowance to which the child is 
entitled; 

• 

•  Name and address of the nearest relative to the minor child know to you, the Petitioner; 
• 
If a court has appointed a guardian for the minor child, information about the guardian 
or co-guardians; 
If the minor child has a representative payee, information about the representative 
payee; 
Information about the person or persons, if any, designated in a power of attorney; 
If an attorney recently represented the minor child, information about the attorney; 
Information about the proposed conservator or co-conservators; 

• 
• 
• 
•  The priority of appointment for the proposed conservator or co-conservators (see 

N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-10); 

•  Whether you’re requesting a limited or full conservatorship; 
•  Description of the less intrusive alternatives to conservatorship you, the Petitioner, 

considered before starting a conservatorship case; and 

•  The reason(s) why appointment of a conservator/co-conservators for the minor child is 

necessary (see N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-01). 

Third (skip this step if you don’t plan to ask the court to appoint a Guardian ad Litem), gather 
the name and contact information of the Guardian ad Litem you’ll propose to the court in Step 
4. Contact the Guardian ad Litem to get their consent, fees and any other information you 
consider necessary. 

Duties of the Guardian ad Litem are found in N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-07(2).

•  A Guardian Ad Litem roster published by the North Dakota State Court Administrators 
Office is available at ndcourts.gov/district-court/parenting-investigator-legal-guardian-
ad-litem-roster. 

•  The Guardian Ad Litem roster is specifically for use in child custody proceedings, but 
may be useful as a starting point for locating a Guardian ad Litem for conservatorship 
proceedings. 

Fourth, review N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-05 to compile a list of people to whom you must provide 
notice of the conservatorship case. Gather the names and current addresses of the following: 

•  The minor child; 
•  The minor child’s parents; 
•  Any other guardian, if any; 
•  Any other conservator, if any; 
•  The Guardian ad Litem, if requesting appointment of a Guardian ad Litem; 
•  Any government agency paying benefits to the minor child, if you, the Petitioner, have 

knowledge of the existence of the benefits; and 

•  Any person who has filed a request for notice under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-29-06. 

Step 2 – Prepare the Petition for Appointment of a Conservator/Co-
Conservators for a Minor Child form and the Confidential Information Form.

•  The case number will be assigned by the clerk of court when the petition is filed in Step 

4.

Service by Publication in a Newspaper: 

If, after a diligent search, you’re unable to find the address or identity of any of the other 
persons listed in listed in Step 1, except the minor child, you may give notice of the hearing by 
publication in a newspaper. See N.D.C.C. § 30.1-03-01 and Rule 4(e) of the North Dakota Rules 
of Civil Procedure. 

The notice must be published at least once a week for three consecutive weeks. The last 
publication of the notice must happen at least 10 days before the hearing: 

•  Publish the Notice of Hearing in a newspaper that has general circulation in the North 

Dakota county where the hearing is scheduled to be held. 

•  You, the petitioner, must request an affidavit of publication from the newspaper after 

publishing is complete. This is your proof of publication of the notice. 

•  You, the petitioner, must complete a declaration for service by publication. The purpose 
of a declaration for service by publication is to describe to the court the diligent efforts 
to locate the person(s). 

•  Make a copy of the affidavit of publication you received from the newspaper and your 

completed and signed declaration for service by publication for your records. 

•  You’ll file the original declaration for service by publication and the affidavit of 

publication with the court in Step 7. 

Step 7 – File the Notice of Hearing, declaration(s) of service, and/or 
certificate(s) of service with the Clerk of Court. 

At least 14 days before the date of the hearing, file the following original documents with the 
clerk of court in the county where the hearing is to be held: 

•  Notice of Hearing; 
•  All declarations of service; and 
•  All certificates of service. 

If you served the Notice of Hearing by publication in a newspaper, at least 10 days before the 
date of the hearing, file the following documents with the clerk of court: 

•  The affidavit of publication you received from the newspaper; and 
•  The original declaration for service by publication.

Step 8 – Attend the hearing. There may be more than one hearing before the 
judge or judicial referee makes a decision. 

You, the petitioner, must be prepared to present evidence proving the claims you made in your 
Petition for Appointment of a Conservator/Co-Conservators for a Minor Child (Child Under 18 
Years Old).  

You must also prove that notice of the hearing and a copy of the Petition was given to all 
persons required to receive notice. (See Step 7.) 

Depending on your circumstances, there may be more than one hearing held before the judge 
or judicial referee decides whether to appoint a conservator or co-conservators. 

As the Petitioner, you’re required to prove your case by a preponderance of the evidence. 
Preponderance of the evidence is the burden of proof by which you must convince the judge or 
judicial referee that a conservator should be appointed for a minor child when the child is 
under 18 years old and: 

•  The child owns money or property that requires management or protection that 

requires a conservator to be appointed; or 

•  The child has or may have business affairs which may be jeopardized or prevented by 

the minor child’s age; or 

•  The child needs funds for the minor child’s support and education and protection is 

necessary or desirable to get or provide the funds 

Black’s Law Dictionary (9th Edition, 2009) partially defines preponderance of the evidence as 
“the greater weight of the evidence, not necessarily established by the greater number of 
witnesses testifying to a fact but by evidence that has the most convincing force.” 

The minor child has the right to present their own evidence, and to cross-examine your 
witnesses. 

Preparing for a hearing is often a complex and confusing process. You’re held to the same 
requirements as an attorney, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. You’ll need 
to conduct additional research to prepare. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

The judicial officer presiding over the hearing(s) will issue a written order granting or denying 
the appointment of a conservator or co-conservators.

Requirements After the Judge or Judicial Referee Appoints a 
Conservator or Co-Conservators 

Read the Findings of Fact and Order Appointing the Conservator or Co-Conservator: 

If the judge or judicial referee appoints a conservator or co-conservator, the findings of fact and 
order of appointment identifies the authority and limitations of the conservator(s) to make 
decisions on behalf of the minor child. The findings of fact and order also identifies any 
limitations the court puts on the minor child in matters where powers aren’t granted to the 
conservator(s). 

As the conservator/co-conservators, you must follow the requirements in the findings of fact 
and order. 

Letters of Conservatorship: 

Along with the findings of fact and order of appointment, the judge or judicial referee will issue 
a document called the letters of conservatorship. To accept the duties of conservator, the 
conservator and co-conservator, if any, appointed by the judge or judicial referee must sign the 
letters of conservatorship. 

The letters of conservatorship is a short version of the findings of fact and order of 
appointment.  

When the conservator(s) needs to present proof of their authority while carrying out their 
duties, they present a certified copy of their letters of conservatorship. 

Purchase certified copies of your letters of conservatorship from the clerk of court. 

Beginning Inventory Report and Annual Report: 

Within 90 days of the court’s order appointing a conservator, the conservator(s) must provide a 
beginning inventory report to the court of the estate of the minor child.  

The conservator(s) must file an annual report with the court. 

Forms and instructions are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/conservatorship. 

 

The Conservatorship ends when the minor child turns 18 years old, or by 
order of the court, whichever happens first.
