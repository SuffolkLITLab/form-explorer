An Informational Guide to a North Dakota State Civil Court Process 

 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this 
informational guide isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court 
process.  If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this 
information suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

     • For more information about finding a lawyer go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-

a-lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about 
the process of petitioning a North Dakota state district court to establish the date and place of 
birth so you can obtain a delayed registration of birth from North Dakota Vital Records Division.  
The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the information 
provided.  The information can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the 
state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

IF YOUR BIRTH (OR YOUR CHILD’S BIRTH) WAS NEVER REGISTERED AND: 

You’ve worked with North Dakota Vital Records Division to obtain a birth certificate, 
BUT 

1) You DON’T have the minimum documentation required for delayed  
     registration to obtain a birth certificate; OR 

2) Vital Records questions the validity or adequacy of your documentation; 

YOU MAY PETITION THE COURT TO ESTABLISH THE DATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH.

SECTION ONE: 

INFORMATION ABOUT PETITIONING TO ESTABLISH THE DATE AND 
PLACE OF BIRTH TO OBTAIN A BIRTH CERTIFICATE 

WHAT IS A DELAYED REGISTRATION OF BIRTH? 

When an individual was born in North Dakota, but the birth wasn’t registered with the North 
Dakota Department of Health Vital Records Division, if valid and adequate evidence is provided 
to the Vital Records Division, the birth can be registered and a birth certificate issued. 

You must first attempt to register the birth through the Vital Records Division. 

Section 23-02.1-15 of the North Dakota Century Code gives the general requirements for 
delayed registration of birth through the Vital Records Division. 

Chapter 33-04-06 of the North Dakota Administrative Code gives the specifics of what type of 
evidence is required for the Vital Records Division to allow delayed registration of birth and 
issue a birth certificate. 

• All certificates of birth registered one year or more after the date of birth are marked 

•

“Delayed” and show the date of the delayed registration.
If the birth is registered after seven days, but within one year of the date of birth, the 
birth certificate isn’t marked “Delayed.”

If you’re unable to register the birth through the Vital Records Division: 

When an individual is unable to register the birth through the process set out by the North 
Dakota Department of Health, the individual may petition a North Dakota state district court to 
establish the date and place of birth, and order the North Dakota Department of Health Vital 
Records Division to issue a birth certificate. 

Chapter 32-37 of the North Dakota Century Code gives the requirements for this type of 
petition.  The individual petitioning the District Court must prove to the Court that they meet all 
of the requirements.  Chapter 32-37 is also available at the end of this guide. 

If your circumstances are complex, or you’re not sure if this is the appropriate court process 
for your circumstances, consult an attorney who can agree to represent you for assistance. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Est Date Place Birth/Rev. Oct 2021 

CAN THIS COURT PROCESS BE USED IF THE BIRTH OCCURRED IN A DIFFERENT 
STATE (NOT IN NORTH DAKOTA)? 

The text of Chapter 32-37 of the North Dakota Century Code doesn’t specifically state if this 
court process can be used if the birth occurred outside of North Dakota. 

Since ND Legal Self Help Center staff can’t point you to specific text in Chapter 32-37, staff can’t 
answer this question.  The answer requires an interpretation of Chapter 32-37, which is part of 
legal representation.  Center staff can’t represent you under any circumstances. 

If you currently live in North Dakota, but you or your minor child were born outside of North 
Dakota, consult an attorney licensed to practice in North Dakota to answer whether you can ask 
a North Dakota state district court to establish the date and place of birth. 

WHO ARE THE PARTIES? 

Petitioner – The individual making the request. 

•

•

If you’re 18 years of age or older and petitioning to establish your own date and place of
birth, you’re the Petitioner.
If you’re petitioning on behalf of a minor child (less than 18 years old) the Petitioner
must be:

o 18 years of age or older; and
o The minor child’s parent or legal guardian.

Respondent – The person or persons you ask the court to order to do something.  The 
Petitioner arranges for service of the notice of hearing and petition on each Respondent. 

For example, if you petition the court to order the North Dakota Department of Health 
Division of Vital Records to do something, the Department of Health Division of Vital Records 
is the Respondent. 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE FORMS TO PETITION TO 
ESTABLISH DATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have a packet of forms for petitioning a North 
Dakota state district court to establish the date and place of birth.  If you decide to represent 
yourself, you’ll need to create and prepare your own legal documents.  Names and descriptions 
of documents you’ll need to create and prepare are listed throughout this guide. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 4 of 19 

Est Date Place Birth/Rev. Oct 2021 

A variety of General-Use forms are available in the Guide to a Civil Action.  You may find the 
General-Use forms of interest as a starting point for creating your own legal documents. 

The Guide to a District Court Civil Action is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by clicking 
on the "Guide to a District Court Civil Action" link under “District Court Civil”.   

The link to the General-Use forms is ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/general-use-forms. 

Formatting examples of some of the documents you’ll need to create and prepare are available 
at the end of this guide. 

IS THERE HELP AVAILABLE FOR CREATING LEGAL DOCUMENTS? 

If you’d like assistance creating your legal documents, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota.   

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court system staff can’t assist you with creating or preparing 
your legal documents. 

FEES 

You’re required to pay an $80.00 filing fee. 

•  See Step Three for information on how to ask the court to waive the $80.00 filing fee 

based on financial circumstances. 

You’re required to pay the newspaper’s fees for publication. 

•  A hearing is required.  Notice of the hearing must be published in the newspaper of the 
North Dakota County where you file the petition.  Notice must be published for two 
consecutive weeks. 

You’re required to pay any service fees. 

•  You must arrange for service of the petition and other supporting documents on the 

North Dakota Department of Health and the Vital Records Division.

LAWYER RESOURCES AND LIMITED LEGAL REPRESENTATION 

You aren’t required to hire a lawyer to bring a civil action in North Dakota State District Court.  
If you decide to represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that a 
lawyer is required to follow. 

Lawyer Resources 

If you decide to find a lawyer to represent you, you may find the following options of interest. 

Legal Services of North Dakota is a non-profit organization, providing free legal
assistance to North Dakota residents in a variety of matters based on income.  Legal
Services of North Dakota can also determine whether an applicant meets the income
requirements for the Volunteer Lawyers program that offers low-cost legal assistance
based on income.  The phone number is (800) 634-5263 and the website is
legalassist.org.

The State Bar Association of North Dakota provides a lawyer referral service to match
paying clients in need of legal services with lawyers.  The phone number is (866) 450-
9579 and the website is sband.org.  The cost is $30.00 for a 30 minute consultation with
a lawyer.

For a list of all lawyers who are licensed to practice in North Dakota, go to the North
Dakota Supreme Court website at ndcourts.gov/Lawyers.  You can narrow your search
by name or location.

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that a lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled.  For example: 

You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your
legal rights and responsibilities;
You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend
hearings yourself;
You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an
attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy;
You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court
appearance for you.

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

SECTION TWO: 

THE PETITION PROCESS TO ESTABLISH DATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH TO 
OBTAIN A BIRTH CERTIFICATE 

STEP ONE: GATHER YOUR DOCUMENTATION & OTHER EVIDENCE 

Chapter 32-37 of the North Dakota Century Code requires you, the Petitioner, to prove the 
date of birth and place of birth, citizenship status, and the names and addresses of the birth 
parents. 

If you, the Petitioner, are petitioning to establish your own date and place of birth, at minimum, 
you must prove the following to the North Dakota state district court: 

•

•

o If the Petitioner was born outside the boundaries of the territorial United States,
sufficient evidence that the Petitioner is a citizen of the United States and the
basis for citizenship.

The Petitioner has lived in North Dakota for at least the past year, and is currently living
in a North Dakota County, and has been living in that county for at least the past 90
days.
The Petitioner’s date of birth and place of birth;
If the Petitioner was born within the United States, whether or not the Petitioner’s
parents were transient aliens or alien public ministers or consuls;
The names of the Petitioner’s parents; and
The addresses of the Petitioner’s parents, if the Petitioner’s parents are alive.

If you, the Petitioner, are petitioning on behalf of a minor child (less than 18 years old) to 
establish the minor child’s date and place of birth, at minimum, you must prove the following 
to the North Dakota state district court: 

The Petitioner’s relationship to the minor child;

Est Date Place Birth/Rev. Oct 2021 

• 

If the minor child was born within the United States, whether or not the minor child’s 
parents were transient aliens or alien public ministers or consuls; 

•  The names of the minor child’s parents; and 
•  The addresses of the minor child’s parents, if the minor child’s parents are alive. 

Create an evidence list of documentation, potential witness testimony, and any other 
evidence. 

Start by creating a two-column evidence list.  In one column, list everything you’re required to 
prove to the court (see Page 7).  In the second column, list the documentation, or other 
evidence, that proves each item in the first column. 

•  An example of a two-column evidence list is found at the end of this Informational 

Guide. 

Some examples of documentation are: 

•  An affidavit from a person with first-hand knowledge of the birth (the judge assigned to 

decide your petition may require the person to appear at the hearing); 

•  A witness with first-hand knowledge of the birth; 
•  Social Security record; 
•  Federal Census record; 
•  Original birth notice in a newspaper; 
•  School record; 
•  Vaccination record; 
• 
Insurance policy; 
•  Passport; 
•  Voter registration card; 
•  Church baptismal and/or church cradle roll record; or 
•  Medical, hospital, or dental record. 

You make all decisions about how to prove the requirements of establishing the date and place 
of birth.  The ND Legal Self Help can’t advise you.  If you need assistance, consult with a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota who can agree to represent you. 

Gather your documentation and other evidence to include as exhibits with your petition.  
Arrange for witness testimony. 

Depending on the type of documentation and other evidence you decide to use, you may need 
to get certified copies. 

Contact the entity directly and ask how you can get a certified copy. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 8 of 19 

Est Date Place Birth/Rev. Oct 2021 

Make a copy of your documentation and type or write an exhibit identifier on each copy. 

For example, Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C.  When you refer to your documentation in your 
petition document, include the name you gave the Exhibit. 

A hearing is required.  You’ll present the documentation you include with your petition and 
witness testimony (if any) at the hearing. 

Keep the originals of your documentation in a file or other safe place.  Once a hearing date is 
scheduled, you’ll need to make sure you have them available for the hearing. 

If a witness is unable or unwilling to appear at the hearing voluntarily, you may need the Clerk 
of Court to issue a subpoena. Only a Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a 
subpoena. 

•

Information about subpoenas is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/subpoenas.

STEP TWO: CREATE YOUR LEGAL DOCUMENTS 

Three Documents are Required: 

1. The Petition to Establish Date and Place of Birth;
2. The Affidavit of Petitioner; and
3. The Confidential Information Form.

One Document MAY be Required by a District Court: 

1. Notice of Hearing.

Create the Petition to Establish Date and Place of Birth: 

A petition is a written request for an order granting the relief the Petitioner is seeking.  The 
petition describes in short, plain statements that you, the Petitioner, are entitled to relief, and 
includes the request, or requests, for relief. 

The Caption (Top) of the petition must include the following: 

•

A formatting example of a petition to establish date and place of birth is found at the end of 
this Informational Guide. The example petition is included only as a formatting example. The 
ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t guarantee or certify its accuracy or legal sufficiency.  Use at 
your own risk. 

Create the Affidavit of Petitioner: 

An affidavit is a written statement of fact given by you, the Petitioner.  Include the facts from 
the petition about which you have first-hand knowledge. 

In other words, it’s your written testimony of the facts you included in your petition. 

•

The Caption (Top) of the affidavit must include the EXACT information included in the
caption of the petition.  EXCEPT the title of the affidavit is “Affidavit of Petitioner”

Guide. The example affidavit is included only as a formatting example. The ND Legal Self Help 
Center doesn’t guarantee or certify its accuracy or legal sufficiency.  Use at your own risk. 

Prepare the Confidential Information Form: 

Full birthdates and the names of minor children are considered confidential and aren’t allowed 
to appear in documents filed with a North Dakota state district court. 

However, the District Court needs to know the full birthdate and names of minor children in 
order to make decisions on petitions to establish the date and place of birth. 

The full birthdates and names of minor children are provided to the court on a Confidential 
Information Form. 

A Confidential Information Form is provided at the end of this guide. 

Prepare the Notice of Hearing: 

You MAY BE required to prepare a Notice of Hearing. This will depend on the Court. 

Section 32-37-03 states that “the clerk of district court whom [the] petition is filed shall issue a 
notice … fixing a time and place for the hearing upon [the] petition.” 

Some courts will prepare the Notice of Hearing. 

However, some courts may require you, the Petitioner, to prepare the Notice of Hearing. 

If you’re required by the court where you file to prepare the Notice of Hearing, an example is 
located at the end of this guide.  The example Notice of Hearing is included only as a 
formatting example. The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t guarantee or certify its accuracy or 
legal sufficiency.  Use at your own risk. 

Make Copies of the Completed Documents: 

Make two copies of the following completed documents: 

1. The Petition to Establish Date and Place of Birth;
2. The Affidavit of Petitioner;
3. The Confidential Information Form; and
4. The Notice of Hearing (if required by the Court where you will file).

Make two copies of all of the exhibits you referred to in your Petition. 

Keep one copy for your records.  You’ll serve the other copies in Step Four.

STEP THREE: FILE THE ORIGINAL PETITION DOCUMENTS WITH THE CLERK OF 
STATE DISTRICT COURT; OBTAIN A HEARING DATE 

The originals of the following completed documents are filed with the clerk of state district 
court: 

•

The Petition to Establish Date and Place of Birth;

o Including exhibits, if any.

•
The Affidavit of Petitioner;
•
The Confidential Information Form;
•
The Notice of Hearing (if required by the Court where you’ll file); and
• Copies of all documentation/exhibits you reference in your Petition.

If the clerk of state district court accepts your documents for filing, the clerk will assign a case 
number.  Make sure the case number is written on all of your documents. 

You will be required to pay an $80.00 filing fee.  Confirm the amount with the clerk of court.  
Contact information for clerks of court by county may be found at ndcourts.gov/court-
locations. 

Forms and instructions for asking the court to waive the $80.00 filing fee are available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/fee-waiver. 

Obtain a hearing date and time from the clerk of court. 

A hearing is required.  If you were required to prepare a Notice of Hearing, obtain the hearing 
date, time, and location from the clerk of court.  Write the date, time, and location on the 
Notice of Hearing and sign and date the document. 

If the clerk of court prepares the Notice of Hearing, you’ll likely be handed the completed 
Notice of Hearing with the date, time, and location.  If the Notice of Hearing will be mailed to 
you, you may ask the clerk of court for the hearing date, time, and location.

STEP FOUR: NOTICE OF HEARING PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPER; SERVE COPIES 
OF THE PETITION DOCUMENTS ON EACH RESPONDENT 

Section 32-37-03 requires publication of the Notice of Hearing in the newspaper of the North 
Dakota county where you file your petition.  The Notice of Hearing must be published for two 
consecutive weeks. 

Depending on the District Court where you file, you may be required to take the Notice of 
Hearing document to the newspaper, or the court may handle it for you. 

If you’re required to publish the Notice of Hearing in the newspaper, contact the newspaper in 
the county for information on the newspaper’s requirements and the fee for publishing the 
notice for two consecutive weeks. 

After publication of the Notice of Hearing is complete, you’ll receive an Affidavit of Publication 
from the newspaper. 

As soon as possible, file the Affidavit of Publication with the clerk of court.  The District Court 
may not hold the hearing if you don’t file the Affidavit of Publication. 

As soon as possible, arrange to serve copies of the petition documents and the Notice of 
Hearing on the Respondents. 

***Filing a document isn’t the same as serving a document. 
Filing doesn’t meet the requirements of service.  Proof of service of the document(s) must be 
filed with the court.*** 

Each Respondent you listed on the petition must be served with one copy of the following 
completed documents: 

•

The Petition to Establish Date and Place of Birth;

o Including exhibits, if any.

The Affidavit of Petitioner;

•
• All documentation/exhibits you reference in your Petition; and
•
The Notice of Hearing with the date, time and location of the
hearing.

When you serve a North Dakota state government agency, you may serve the documents on 
any of the following: 

•
The managing head of the agency;
•
The North Dakota Attorney General; or
• An Assistant North Dakota Attorney General.

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 14 of 19 

Est Date Place Birth/Rev. Oct 2021 

The documents must be served as required by Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure. 

•

For information about the requirements and process of serving documents as required
by Rule 4, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action.  Carefully review
the service information to start a civil action in this section.

You must provide proof of service for each Respondent to the state district court. 

A completed and signed affidavit of service from the person who served the documents is 
your proof of service. 

Blank affidavit of service forms are available at the link above. 

File proof of service with the clerk of court as soon as possible BEFORE the date of the 
hearing.  If you don’t provide proof of service to the state district court, the court won’t act on 
your petition 

If the Respondents oppose your petition they must do so in writing and file with the District 
Court before the date of the hearing. 

Anyone, including the Respondents, is allowed to appear at the hearing. 

STEP FIVE: PREPARE FOR THE HEARING 

After the petition is filed, the case is assigned to a judge.  The judge presides over the hearing 
and decides whether to grant your petition. 

Prepare Your Case: 

You, the petitioner, must prove the statements in your petition. 

Caution! Preparing a case is often a complex and confusing process. You’re held to the same 
requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

You’ll need to conduct additional research to prepare. 

Subpoenas: If you require a witness to appear at a hearing or require production of documents, 
electronically stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of Court to 
issue a subpoena. Only a Clerk of Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

•

Information about subpoenas is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/subpoenas.

STEP SIX: ATTEND THE HEARING

minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

If the Hearing will be Held In-Person, Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the 
Hearing:

can connect and understand how to function in Zoom. 

Don’t be late to the Zoom hearing. If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t attend 
the hearing on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing: 

The Judge hears both sides and then issues a final finding of fact and order.  Sometimes, the 
final findings of fact and order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the final findings of 
fact and order is issued at a later date. 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order: 

• Opening Statements

o Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Petitioner goes first.

•

Petitioner Presents Witnesses and Evidence

o The Petitioner presents their case first. The Respondent may cross-examine

witnesses and object to the Petitioner’s evidence.

• Respondent Presents Witnesses and Evidence

o The Respondent presents their case after the Petitioner.  The Petitioner may

cross-examine witnesses and object to the Respondent’s evidence.

• Closing Arguments

o Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Respondent goes first.

Before You Leave the Courthouse: 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you’re not sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next.

STEP SEVEN: FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER 

THE JUDGE MAY PREPARE THEIR OWN FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER. 

If the Judge prepares their own Findings of Fact and Order, you’ll be mailed a signed 
copy.  

HOWEVER, YOU, THE PETITIONER, MAY BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE A PROPOSED 
FINDINGS OF FACT AND ORDER FOR THE JUDGE TO SIGN. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee requires you, the Petitioner, to prepare proposed 
Findings of Fact and Order, complete Step 7. 

Proposed Findings of Fact and Order: 

Review Rule 7.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Court carefully! 

Findings of fact are the Judge’s written determination of the facts made from the evidence 
presented at the hearing. This explains what facts the Judge found to be true. 

The Order is the ruling of law made by the Judge based on, or in connection with, the findings 
of fact.  These are the legal consequences of the facts the Judge or Judicial Referee found to be 
true. 

The Judge will decide whether the Petitioner’s proposed Findings of Fact and Order are 
appropriate.  If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides they are appropriate, the Judge will sign 
and date the Findings of Fact and Order. 

The Findings of Fact and Order isn’t official until signed and dated by the Judge. 

A formatting example of proposed Findings of Fact and Order is located at the end of this guide. 

STEP EIGHT: FINDINGS OF FACT & ORDER IS FILED WITH THE NORTH DAKOTA 
VITAL RECORDS DIVISION 

IMPORTANT! Step Eight ONLY HAPPENS IF the District Court judge assigned to your petition 
establishes the date and place of birth in the Findings of Fact & Order. 

Following the hearing, if the date and place of birth are established, the clerk of court certifies 
a copy of the Findings of Fact and Order and files it with North Dakota Vital Records Division.
