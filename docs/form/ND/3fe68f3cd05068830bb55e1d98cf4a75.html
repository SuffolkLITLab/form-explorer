Summer Reading Celebration

TIOGA PUBLIC LIBRARY
It  isn’t  often  that  North  Dakota  gets  a  new  public 
library,  but  as  of  April  1,  2019,  the  Tioga  Public 
Library was officially established. For the past year,  
a  large  group  of  committed  citizens  worked  with 
their  local  representatives  to  petition  for  library 
service  as  per  North  Dakota  Century  Code.  They  
now have a location in the brand new Community 
Center  and  are  in  the  process  of  hiring  a  library 
director.  There  is  no  official  opening  date  yet,  but 
the  library  board  is  working  hard  to  get  shelving, 
furniture, and technology in place so that the library 
can open this summer. 

Congratulations, Tioga!

 News and Thoughts...

from Mary J. Soucie, State Librarian

Happy  National  Library  Week!  By  the  time  you  read  this,  
National Library Week (NLW) will be over. I am writing this on 
National Library Workers Day, a favorite day for me to celebrate 
my  colleagues,  both  internal  and  external.  I  tip  my  hat  to  all 
of  you.  I  am  constantly  amazed  by  all  the  different  services, 
programs  and  resources  that  are  offered  by  libraries  of  all 
types and sizes. The greatest resource of any library is the staff, 
whether it’s a one-person library or a library with hundreds of 
staff members. 

National Library Week was first celebrated in 1958. In the mid-
1950’s, it had been determined that Americans were spending 
less  money  on  books  and  more  money  on  TV,  radios,  and 
musical  instruments.  The  American  Library  Association  and 
the American Book Publishers were concerned that Americans 
were spending less time reading and partnered to create the 
National  Book  Committee  in  1958.  The  committee  had  wide 
ranging  and  ambitious  goals  and  we  can  thank  them  for  the 
first NLW. The theme of that first celebration was “Wake Up and 
Read!” I think we can all get behind that theme. 

This  year’s  theme  is  Libraries  =  Strong  Communities,  another 
theme that I think we can all support. Many of you have heard 
me say, more than once probably, that libraries are the center of 
the community that they serve and I really believe that should 
be our goal. We are one of the last remaining entities that serves 
everyone that walks through our doors regardless of age, race, 
ethnicity, socio economic status, level of education or any other 
qualifier that we put on people today. In simpler words, we serve 
everyone that walks through our doors, regardless if they are 
“our” patron or the neighboring library’s or even from another 
state or country. Libraries are the great equalizers today, and it is 
a role we need to recognize, cherish, and celebrate!

It  doesn’t  matter  what  type  of  library  we  serve  in;  we  exist 
to  serve  the  needs  of  the  community  that  we  serve.  We 
should  never  lose  sight  of  this.  Every  library  is  as  unique 
as  the  community  that  they  are  serving.  We  do  have  some 
commonalities,  though.  Besides  serving  everyone  who  walks 
through our doors, all libraries provide books in some format, 
and  an  increasing  number  of  libraries  are  offering  e-books  in 
a variety of formats. Libraries of all types and sizes offer online 
resources  or  databases.  We  are  lucky  in  North  Dakota  to  be  
able  to  offer  these  on  a  statewide  basis  in  partnership  with 
ODIN  and  Minitex.  Librarians  support  Intellectual  Freedom. 
Unfortunately, another commonality is that libraries of all types 
face materials challenges. 

According to the recent report released by the American Library 
Association (ALA), 100% of public libraries offer Internet access 
and 98% offer free Wi-Fi. There are more public libraries in the 
U.S.  than  Starbucks  or  McDonalds.  In  2016,  over  113  million 
people  attended  programs  at  public  libraries  which  is  more 

than the attendance at MLB, NFL, and NBA games combined. 
In  North  Dakota  in  2017,  more  people  visited  public  libraries 
than  attendance  at  all  Vikings  home  games,  NDSU  football 
games,  UND  home  hockey  games,  the  State  Fair  and  the  
Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. We had over 2 million visits to public 
libraries that year. 

Academic libraries serve 28 million people each year, which is 
4  million  more  than  attend  men’s  college  basketball  games. 
They  have  more  than  25  billion  electronic  and  physical  items 
in  their  collections,  and  digital  media  has  increased  by  more 
than 50% since 2014. In North Dakota, our academic libraries 
are  reimagining  their  space  by  creating  learning  commons, 
makerspaces, and better accommodations to meet the needs 
of their students and faculty. A number of our academic libraries 
have  added  3D  printers,  STEM  kits,  and  other  innovative 
materials to meet the needs of those that they serve. 

School libraries teach students critical thinking skills and serve 
as learning hubs and homework help centers. There have been 
more  than  60  studies  that  have  proven  that  school  libraries 
staffed  with  full-time  librarians  have  a  positive  impact  on 
students  learning.  According  to  a  recent  study  from  Stanford 
University, 80% of students cannot tell the difference between 
real news and sponsored content, a trend that can be correlated 
to the alarming trend of limiting or cutting the time that Library 
Media Specialists spend in the school library. There are 90,400 
public and private K-12 schools in the U.S. While 91% of them 
have a school library, only 61% have a full-time librarian. This 
trend is bearing out in North Dakota school libraries as more 
of  our  librarians  are  having  to  split  their  time  between  the 
library and the classroom and sometimes even a third or fourth 
position.  Despite  these  challenges,  school  librarians  in  North 
Dakota  are  still  providing  innovative  services,  leadership  and 
support  to  the  teachers  and  students  that  they  serve.  They 
are adding STEM kits and other technology resources so that 
students  are  learning  more  and  are  future  ready.  We  have  a 
number  of  school  libraries  that  have  additional  hours  for  the 
community as well as a number that are providing additional 
summer learning activities such as a Summer Reading Program.

If you would like to read more about the State of Libraries as well 
as information about the top 10 banned books of last year, the 
ALA report can be found at http://bit.ly/2UNN5FL. 

The libraries in North Dakota are clearly making a difference in 
the lives of those that they serve. It is our honor at the North 
Dakota  State  Library  to  support  you  in  your  efforts  and  we 
encourage you to reach out to us if we can assist in anyway, even 
if it’s just to serve as a sounding board. Continue to reach for 
new heights of service by providing innovative services, a well-
balanced collection and strengthening the community that you 
serve. Continue to prove that Libraries = Strong Communities.

ND Histories Map

The most frequently visited State Library collection on Digital Horizons is North Dakota County and Town 
Histories, which is a digital collection of county, town, church, school, township, and organization histories. 
There  are  currently  over  400  books  (containing  over  50,000  pages)  that  have  been  digitized  and  made 
publicly available online. Every book has full-text search capabilities, so keywords, names, locations, etc. are 
easily found. 

These 400+ books are from communities all across the state. To provide a visual, the Digital Initiatives team 
has created a Google Map of this collection. Each pin on the map represents a location that has a book 
digitized and available online on Digital Horizons. The pins on the map are organized into two categories/ 
colors: county histories (red pins) and town histories (blue pins).

Clicking on a pin, will open up a small box that links to all of the books associated with that location in 
the North Dakota County and Town Histories collection on Digital Horizons. The ND Histories Map can be 
accessed at http://bit.ly/2UJaTdX.

GRANTS CALENDAR

Each month’s issue of the Flickertale features a list of grants applicable to schools and libraries. As 
these grants are either ongoing or will have various deadlines, the State Library has come up with a 
new way to track them.

A digital calendar has been created that features the grants from the Flickertale. On the calendar, the 
grants are entered on their due date. The grants closing the soonest are automatically featured first, 
and scrolling down will reveal more upcoming grants.

Clicking on a grant will expand the “event” and reveal additional information like a summary and the 
link to the grant, which also happens to be the same information that is found in the Flickertale. 

The calendar is meant to be a companion to the grants highlighted each month in the Flickertale, and 
it can be accessed on the State Library’s website at http://library.nd.gov/grants.html

2019 TEENS’ TOP TEN NOMINEES ANNOUNCED

Every year in April since 2003, the Young Adult Library Services Association 
(YALSA) releases the list of nominees for the Teens’ Top Ten List.  Teens are 
encouraged to read the list of over 25 books to take part in voting for their 
ten favorite books of the year in August and September. The winning titles 
will be announced via a webcast during Teen Read Week in October.

Jack Martin, YALSA’s president, feels that “today’s teens seem to have less 
and less free time, and there are increasingly more activities to for them 
to  take  part  in  during  what  little  leisure  time  they  have. That  is  why  it’s 
important to encourage teens to set aside some time to read.” Literacy is a 
topic of both local and national concern, and falling test scores and lower 
graduation rates among teens today are a serious issue.

Parents and caregivers of teens are encouraged to make time for their teens to read at home. The following 
are some ideas to make this happen:

•  Visit the local public or school library with your teen to attend a program or to check out books or 

other reading materials. 

•  Set aside time each night for the family to read. 
•  Give books, audiobooks or magazine subscriptions to your teen as a gift or reward. 
•  Share your favorite book with your teen. 
•  Visit the Teens’  Top Ten site at www.ala.org/teenstopten. 
•  Join or start a book discussion group at school or at the public library. 

Teen Read WeekTM is held annually during the third week of October. To find out more about the Teens’ Top 
Ten and Teen Read Week contact your local library

•	 #MurderTrending by Gretchen McNeil

•	 Frat	Girl by Kiley Roache

A NEW CHAPTER
Submitted by Stephanie Asselin, Director of the McKenzie County Public Library

APRIL 2019

   

 

 

Stephanie Asselin 
(pictured) served 
as Assistant 
Library Director 
and Interim 
Library Director 
throughout this 
entire project. 
On March 27, 
2019, she was 
promoted to 
Library Director.

It  wasn’t  until  reaching  out  to  the  North  Dakota 
State  Library  that  a  concrete  solution  revealed 
itself—doing  away  with  overdue  fines.  The 
McKenzie  County  Public  Library  drafted  its  new 
policies  and  procedures  based  on  the  model 
set  forth  by  the  North  Dakota  State  Library,  and  
in  February  of  2019,  our  Library  Board  approved 
the  drafted  documents  pending  approval  by  the 
Board of County Commissioners.

On  March  5,  2019,  after  a  presentation  made 
by  the  Interim  Library  Director,  the  Board  of 
County  Commissioners  approved  all  policies  and 
procedures,  agreed  to  cease  charging  overdue 
fines,  and  to  waive  all  outstanding  money  owed. 
The library hasn’t looked back since.

For  more  information,  feel  free  to  contact  the 
McKenzie County Public Library at (701) 444-3785  
or visit us online at: 

https://mckenziecountyndlibrary.com

The  McKenzie  County  Public  Library  can  be  found 
nestled in the heart of Watford City, ND. As the Oil 
Boom  expanded  the  population  of  the  town,  the 
library was faced with new issues.

The transient population within Watford City grew, 
as  did  the  number  of  individuals  utilizing  the 
library.  However,  as  circulation  increased  so  did  
the number of books that were never returned.

In  January  of  2019,  a  team  comprising  of  the 
Assistant Library Director and an Assistant Librarian 
took  on  the  task  of  completing  a  full  inventory;  
a task that had not been done in at least 9 years.

Conducting  a  full  inventory  was  the  first  step 
in  determining  the  basis  of  a 
issue— 
overdue items. 

larger 

After further research, it was found that the library 
was lacking official policies and procedures on how 
to  handle  overdue  items.  In  total,  the  library  was 
owed  over  $20,000  in  both  overdue  fines  and  lost 
item fees. 

With inventory completed, it was time to draft the 
new  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  a  situation 
like this did not arise again in the future. 

Over the course of a few weeks, the Interim Library 
Director reached out to various libraries in western 
North  Dakota  to  see  how  they  handled  overdue 
items and billing.

At  this  point,  the  library  had  firmly  established 
where  our  problem  laid—fines  and  fees  that  were 
accumulating  indefinitely  due  to  a  lack  of  policies 
and  procedures. This  lead  to  the  question: “Where 
do we go from here?”

It  was  determined  that  due  to  the  lack  of  policies 
and procedures, the library was incapable of trying 
to collect on the money owed; it would need to be 
waived. This solution raised even more issues. How 
would the library ensure this didn’t happen again? 
How  could  the  library  make  this  into  a  positive 
change  that  would  benefit  the  entire  community 
and not just those who never paid their fees?

APRIL 2019

By Jessica Robinson

It’s  time  to  make  our  summer  reading  list!    This 
month, we’ll look at some of 2019’s hottest YA titles, 
from the beginning of the year and right up into fall. 

We’ll start with a book that needs little introduction.  
Angie  Thomas  knocked  it  out  of  the  park  once 
again  with  On	 the	 Come	 Up,  featuring  a  young 
woman  who  wants  to  be  a  world-famous  rapper 
but her family’s dire financial straits make the idea 
of  success  seem  as  impossible  as  keeping  their 
home.    Katy  Loutzenhiser’s  If	 You’re	 Out	 There  is 
about  Zan,  who  at  first  thinks  that  her  best  friend 
is  ghosting  her  since  her  move  and  then  starts  to 
wonder if her bizarre online posts point to a more 
sinister  reason  for  their  estrangement.    Jennifer  E. 
Smith’s  Field	 Notes	 on	 Love  starts  with  an  unlikely 
key  to  romance—non-transferrable  train  tickets—
and pushes together two disparate teens just when 
they  need  a  change  in  their  lives.    Night	 Music  by 
Jenn  Marie Thorne  is  the  story  of  a  girl  born  into 
musical  royalty,  trying  to  figure  out  who  she  is 
if  she’s  not  the  heir  to  her  father’s  legacy,  and  a 
talented  boy  trying  to  break  into  her  privileged 
world while doing his best not to fall in love with his 
hero’s daughter.  Sky	Without	Stars	is the first book 
in a new series by Jessica Brody and Joanne Rendell 
and it proposes to reintroduce us to the story of Les	
Miserables,  this  time  on  another  planet  where  the 
wealthy descendants of the French upper class rule 
the starving poor under a perpetually cloudy sky. 

April began strong with Christine Lynn Herman’s The	
Devouring	 Gray,  a  mix  of  small-town  mystery  and 
unspeakable  horror  when  Violet  Saunders  moves 
from the big city to a rural town that her ancestors 
helped  build,  through  otherworldly  means.    Peter 
Bognanni’s  This	 Book	 Is	 Not	 Yet	 Rated  has  a  classic 
80s  movie  plot  with  its  focus  on  saving  a  beloved 
theater from greedy land developers, a fact which 
would  please  its  protagonist,  Ethan,  since  movies 
are the only thing that still make sense to him since 
his  film  professor  father  died.    The	 Descendant	 of	
the	Crane by Joan He has one of the most gorgeous 
covers  of  the  year  and  an  equally  engaging  plot 

when  Princess  Hesina  of Yan  is  forced  to  become 
queen  while  also  trying  to  find  her  father’s  killer 
among  the  horde  of  advisors  that  surround  her.  
Julie Buxbaum’s Hope	and	Other	Punchlines is about 
Abbi, better known nationwide as Baby Hope from 
the pictures taken of her as a toddler on 9/11.  Abbi 
wants  to  move  past  her  fame  but  an  encounter 
with  a  grieving  young  man  forces  her  to  begin 
investigating  the  famous  photo  that  shaped  her 
life.    Fake	 It	 Till	 You	 Break	 It  by  Jenn  P.  Nguyen  is 
about love at fiftieth sight when Mia and Jake, the 
beleaguered children of best friends, hatch a plan 
to prove to their mothers that they aren’t destined 
to be together.

As  we  move  into  the  rest  of  the  year,  we  hit  Lori 
Goldstein’s Screen	Queens	in June, the story of three 
ambitious young women attempting to be the first 
all-female team to win a prestigious internship at a 
tech  start-up.    Better	 Than	 the	 Best	 Plan  by  Lauren 
Morrill starts when Ritzy’s careful plans for summer 
are ruined thanks to a social worker discovering that 
her mother abandoned her yet again.  Ritzy ends up 
in the foster home she went to as an infant, leaving 
Ritzy  to  wonder  if  she  really  wants  her  mother  to 
come  back  this  time.    Lisa  Fiedler’s  We	 Walked	the	
Sky  is  a  historical  drama  about  a  young  woman 
running away to join the circus and the notes she 
inadvertently leaves for her granddaughter to find 
decades later.  David Yoon’s Frankly	in	Love is about 
two  Korean-American  teenagers  attempting  to 
forge  their  own  identities  under  the  eyes  of  their 
traditional  families  by  pretending  to  date  one 
another.    Finally,  October  debuts  first-time  author 
Kelly  Coon’s  Gravemaidens,  which  explores  the 
bonds  of  family  and  tradition  when  Kammani’s 
younger  sister  is  chosen  to  be  one  of  their  ruler’s 
maidens in the afterlife.

May  is  one  of  my  favorite  months  because  it’s 
the  month  we’ll  take  a  look  at  the  best  and  most  
highly-anticipated  science  fiction  titles  of  the 
year.  Come back next month to discuss the Hugo 
nominees and a plethora of other great titles.

YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE MONTH:  
WORLD DIGITAL LIBRARY
Submitted by Angie Houser

I’m throwing it back a bit for this month’s video of the 
month. I’m taking you back to the very first tutorials 
that I did as the Continuing Education Coordinator. 
Though they might look a bit rough, they are full of 
great information on the World Digital Library. This is 
an online archive created by the Library of Congress 
to preserve archival items in danger of deterioration 
from institutions around the world. The videos (parts
1 and 2) go over the history of the database, how to use it, and some of the wonderful features 
involved with it. Check them out!

PROGRAM SPOTLIGHT:  
NAIL POLISH CRAFTS
Submitted by Abby Ebach

Some  new  craft  time  inspiration  comes 
in  the  form  of  using  up  old  nail  polish. 
Ask  your  community  to  donate  their  old 
cosmetics  or  have  students  bring  in  their 
own.  You  can  paint  the  back  of  flat  beads 
to  create  beautiful  magnets  like  this  or 
upcycle  jewelry,  mugs,  and  earbuds  like 
this  blog  suggests.  Layering  bright  colors 
and  different  textures  like  glitter  or  crackle 
polishes  bring  a  whole  new  dimension  to 
these  crafts,  and  more  than  one  can  easily 
be  done  in  one  program.  Let  your  patrons  
have some flexibility and freedom with this 
crafty program.

The  North  Dakota  State  Library  had  a 
booth  up  at  the  Capitol  for  the  Afterschool  
Network where we had the pleasure of talking 
about the services libraries provide.

LEGAL RESEARCH RESOURCES FOR NORTH DAKOTA  
COURT RULES (PROCEDURAL LAW) 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

This  is  the  seventh  in  a  series  of  Flickertale  articles 
that aim to take the mystery out of North Dakota’s 
legal reference resources.

Citations to Court Rules

The  previous  articles  in  this  series  can  be  found  in 
past issues of The	Flickertale. 

Next month’s article will get into more detail about 
legal  research  resources  for  the  North  Dakota 
Administrative  Code.  The  Administrative  Code  is 
the rules and regulations enacted by North Dakota’s 
Executive Branch agencies.

WHAT ARE COURT RULES?

Court  rules,  also  called  procedural  law,  govern  the 
process  of  bringing  a  case  to  court  and  how  the  
case  proceeds  once  it  gets  to  court.  In  general,  
court rules answer “How do I” questions.

rights  and 

To  compare,  substantive  law,  such  as  the  North 
Dakota  Century  Code  and  case  law,  establishes  
responsibilities  and  grants 
legal 
jurisdiction  (authority)  to  a  court  to  hear  and 
decide  a  case.  In  general,  substantive  law  answers  
“Can I” questions.

North  Dakota’s  court  rules,  or  procedural  law,  are 
enacted  by  the  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court, 
often  upon  recommendation  by  a  Judicial  Branch 
committee.  Court  rules  cover  procedures  such  as 
when  a  case  starts,  service  of  documents  in  the  
case,  how  requests  are  made  to  the  court,  among 
many others.

Every  set  of  court  rules  has  a  unique  citation. 
Following  are  the  basic  citations  for  commonly 
referenced sets of court rules.

•  North  Dakota  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  = 

•  North  Dakota  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure  = 

•  North  Dakota  Rules  of  Juvenile  Procedure  = 

N.D.R.Civ.P.

N.D.R.Crim.P.

N.D.R.Juv.P.

•  North Dakota Rules of Evidence = N.D.R.Ev.
•  North Dakota Rules of Court = N.D.R.Ct.
•  North  Dakota  Supreme  Court  Administrative 
Rules  and  Administrative  Orders  =  N.D.  Sup.  
Ct. Admin.

When  referencing  a  specific  rule  within  a  set  of 
court rules, the basic citation is listed first, then the  
number  of  the  rule.  For  example,  the  citation  for 
Rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure 
is N.D.R.Civ.P. 4.

NDCOURTS.GOV  LEGAL  RESEARCH  RESOURCES 
FOR COURT RULES

www.ndcourts.gov  provides  a  variety  of 
legal  
research  tools  for  North  Dakota’s  court  rules.  Links 
to  all  of  the  rule  sets  are  available  under  the “Legal  
Resources” drop down menu. The website is free to use.

www.ndcourts.gov  is  also  the  source  for  the  most 
current version of each court rule.

For  example,  procedure  in  civil  actions  in  North 
Dakota  district  court  is  governed  by  the  North  
Dakota  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  the  North  Dakota 
Rules  of  Court,  and  the  North  Dakota  Rules  of 
Evidence.

Table of Contents for Each Set of Court Rules

After  clicking  on  the  link  for  a  specific  set  of  court 
rules,  a  table  of  contents  displays  with  the  title  of 
each rule that makes up the set. The title is also a link 
to the text of the rule.

All  lawyers  and  self-represented  individuals  are 
required  to  follow  the  court  rules  that  apply  to  
their case. 

(Don’t  forget  about  the  printed  North  Dakota 
Century  Code  General  Index!  The  topic  sections 
within  the  General  Index  include  references  to  
North Dakota court rules, when applicable.)

Effective Date for Each Rule

  

 

The effective date of the current version of a rule is 
listed  on  the  top  right  of  the  webpage  containing 
the text of the rule.

Explanatory Note Section for Each Rule

An  Explanatory  Note  section  follows  the  text  of 
the  rule.  The  Explanatory  Note  section  provides 
a  wealth  of  information  about  the  reasons  the 
rule  was  enacted  or  amended,  which  committee 
recommended  the  rule  or  amendments,  other  
North  Dakota  rules  or  laws  that  were  considered 
as part of the enactment or amendment, and cross 
references to other rules that may have a connection 
to the rule.

Many of the references within the Explanatory Note 
section are linked to additional information, such as 
a link to the petition to the Supreme Court to enact 
or amend the rule, a link to the committee minutes 
discussing  the  rule,  and  direct  links  to  other  court 
rules that may have a connection.

Version  History  (Historical  Legal  Research)  for 
Each Rule

A  Version  History  section  follows  the  Explanatory 
Note section of the rule. The Version History section 
lists  the  effective  date  and  obsolete  date  of  every 
version of the rule. If the text of the obsolete version 
of the rule is available on the website, a “View” link 
will be listed to the right of the obsolete date.

North  Dakota  Century  Code:  Court  Rules 
Annotated (Print Only)

The Court Rules Annotated is part of the North Dakota 
Century  Code  print  collection.  It  is  a  softbound  
book with the text of all of the North Dakota court 
rules in effect at the time of printing.

If a rule within the Court Rules Annotated has related 
case law, snapshots of the opinions are printed after 
the text of the rule.

The snapshots of the opinions are only available in 
the print version of the Court Rules Annotated.

To view the full opinion, a patron will need to use a 
different print or online legal research resource. (See 
the March 2019 Flickertale article.)

Subscription Legal Research Websites

LexisNexis  (www.lexis.com)  and  Westlaw  (www.
westlaw.com)  provide  access  to  an  extensive  list 
of  legal  research  resources,  including  snapshots  of 
decisions  for  each  North  Dakota  court  rule.  These 
websites  tend  to  be  cost-effective  for  entities  with 
many  lawyers.  Locating  free  or  low-cost  access 
to  these  websites  is  a  challenge  for  individual 
researchers.  However,  the  North  Dakota  Supreme 
Court Law Library currently offers free patron access 
to  Westlaw.  Patrons  may  use  Westlaw  on  the  Law 
Library patron access computer located at the State 
Capitol in Bismarck. Time limits apply based on the 
number of patrons requesting access.

The Version  History  section  is  a  convenient  way  to 
conduct historical legal research of a court rule.

ONLINE  LEGAL  RESEARCH  RESOURCES  FROM 
THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER

CASE LAW INTERPRETING COURT RULES

Case  law  is  a  very  useful  resource  for  researching 
what  a  procedural  rule  means.  The  North  Dakota 
Supreme Court regularly interprets what procedural 
rules mean as part of deciding appeals in civil and 
criminal cases.

www.ndcourts.gov  does  not  have  a  case 
resource specifically related to court rules.

A reminder that a new “Legal Research” section was 
added to the recently updated North Dakota Legal 
Self Help Center website. (www.ndcourts.gov/legal-

The “How to Research Your Legal Issue” link in the new 
section  includes  an  overview  of  the  legal  research 
process,  a  printable  Legal  Research  Guide  and 
Checklist, and references to a variety of resources.

Register: http://bit.ly/2EYfZZZ

Everyone  has  a  pile  of  photos  somewhere  and  wants  to  digitize  them—but  where  to  start? This  webinar  
builds  upon  the  basic  concepts  introduced  in  the  instructor’s  previous  Digitization  101  webinar.  It  will

Libraries have the position and the power to rebuild social bonds, offering that sense of community and 
shared  place  that  humans  crave.  Active  learning  programs  that  bring  people  together  for  participatory, 
shared experiences are a boost to community strength, but they could go even further to amplify social 
connection  and  build  social  infrastructure.  Join  us  as  we  explore  library  programs  through  the  lens  of  
social possibilities and devise strategies to be more intentional about forging stronger community bonds.

father’s disappearance by entering a contest run by a virtual reality company to a boy who gets a second

family’s funeral home, plus much more!

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
