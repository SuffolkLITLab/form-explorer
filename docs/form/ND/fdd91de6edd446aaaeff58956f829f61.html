INFORMATION ABOUT MOTIONS FOR INTERIM ORDERS IN DOMESTIC 
RELATIONS CASES 

WHAT IS A MOTION FOR AN INTERIM ORDER IN A DOMESTIC RELATIONS CASE? 

An interim order is a temporary court order following a required evidentiary hearing.  The order 
is intended to be of limited duration.  Generally, an interim order will only be in effect until the 
court makes a final order in the domestic relations case. 

A motion for interim order is a written request to the Court identifying any proposals for 
resolution of an issue on a temporary basis. 

Generally, an interim order may be requested after a domestic relations case has already been 
started. 

Domestic relations cases are family disputes involving the rights and duties of parents, children, 
husbands and/or wives.   

An interim order may include: 

Payment of support,
Temporary parental rights and responsibilities,

•
•
• A parenting schedule of minor children,
•
Payment of attorney’s fees and costs,
•
The use of real or personal property; and/or
•
For restraining and eviction regarding property.

An interim order cannot be amended, unless: 

•
•

The parties have previously agreed to allow amendments; and/or
In the event of a material change of circumstances.

WHAT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF SOME OF THE COMMONLY USED TERMS IN A 
MOTION FOR AN INTERIM ORDER? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they are not intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Best Interests of the Child – The 13 factors the District Court uses when deciding the residential 
responsibility and parenting time arrangements that are in the best interests of the child. The 
13 factors are listed in North Dakota Century Code Section 14-09-06.2. 
www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t14c09.pdf 

Child support – Money paid by a parent for the financial benefit of a child.  Child support is 
based on guidelines set by the North Dakota Department of Human Services.  If a parent can 
show a different ability to earn income than the guidelines show, the court may order a higher 
or lower child support payment. 

The Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services created and 
provides support for the Child Support Guidelines Calculator. The Calculator is available at 
childsupport.dhs.nd.gov/lawyers/child-support-guidelines. 

Custody – See Residential Responsibility. 

Decision making responsibility – The responsibility to make decisions concerning the minor 
child. The term may refer to decisions on all issues or on specific issues, but not child support 
issues.  

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 9 of 35 

Motion for Interim Order/Apr 2019 

Deploying or deployed parent – A deploying, or deployed parent is a uniformed service 
member who has been notified of orders of movement or mobilization for more than ninety 
days, but less than eighteen months AND the orders are designated as unaccompanied, not 
authorized for dependent travel, or do not permit family members to move to the deployment 
location.  

Domestic relations cases – Family disputes involving the rights and duties of parents, children, 
husband and/or wife.  

For example: 

• Divorce – The only way to legally end your marriage. In other words, the two married

•

individuals become unmarried once their divorce is granted by a court.
Legal separation – A civil court process with requirements that are similar to the
requirements for granting a divorce. However, unlike a divorce, legal separation does
not end the marriage, but it does end many of the legal responsibilities spouses have to
each other, while they are married.
Establishing parenting rights and responsibilities – A civil court process involving
parents who were never married to each other, which determines all the rights and
responsibilities a parent has concerning the parent’s child.
• Paternity – The establishment of a father-child relationship.
• Maternity – The establishment of a mother-child relationship.

•

Evidentiary hearing – An evidentiary hearing is similar to a trial, except without a jury. The 
Moving Party presents their evidence and witnesses, and then the Opposing Party has an 
opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses and also call their own witnesses who may be 
cross-examined by the Moving Party. The Judicial Officer weighs all the facts, evidence, and 
arguments presented at the evidentiary hearing and either grants or dismisses the motion for 
an interim order. 

Ex-Parte Motion for an Interim Order – Also called an emergency or urgent motion. An ex-
parte interim order is granted by a judge who makes a decision on the motion based only on 
the documents and affidavit evidence BEFORE holding the required hearing.    

Ex-parte interim orders will only be issued if a court thinks that there are exceptional 
circumstances present.  If the court grants an ex-parte interim order, an evidentiary hearing 
MUST be held within 30 days of the court granting the ex-parte interim order. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Motion for Interim Order/Apr 2019 

Home state – The state in which a minor child lived with a parent for at least six consecutive 
months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding. In the case of a 
child less than six months of age, home state means the state in which the child lived from birth 
with a parent. A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the 
period.  

Marital property – All of the assets and debts owned by either spouse, whether owned jointly 
or individually.  

Material Change in Circumstances – Significant change or changes since the original domestic 
relations case started, unknown at the time the case started, requiring a resolution of an issue 
on a temporary basis to serve the best interests of the child.  

Obligor – The person ordered by the court to pay child support or spousal support.  

Obligee – The person receiving child support or spousal support ordered by the court. 

Parental rights and responsibilities – All the rights and responsibilities a parent has concerning 
the parent's minor child.  

Parenting plan – A written plan describing each parent's rights and responsibilities.  

Parenting schedule – The schedule of when the minor child is in the care of each parent. 

Parenting time – The time when the minor child is to be in the care of a parent. (Also known as 
visitation.)

responsibility.  

Residential responsibility – A parent's responsibility to provide a home for the child. (Also 
known as custody.)

WHO ARE THE PARTIES IN A MOTION FOR AN INTERIM ORDER? 

Plaintiff: The parent or spouse who is listed as the Plaintiff in the original domestic relations 
action. For example, the parent who started the action with service of the summons and 
complaint on the other parent. 

Defendant: The parent or spouse who is listed as the Defendant in the original domestic 
relations action. For example, the parent who filed a written Answer in order to participate in 
the original case.  

Moving Party: The parent or spouse bringing the Motion for an Interim Order. The Moving 
Party in the motion may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant.  

Opposing Party: The other parent or spouse. In other words, the parent or spouse who is not 
bringing the motion. (Also called the Non-moving party.)  

Real Party in Interest – (Also known as the Statutory Real Party in Interest.) The State of North 
Dakota is added as a real party in interest to parenting rights and responsibilities actions only 
when:  

•

•

•

Child support will be established or modified, and a minor child receives assistance
through programs administered by the North Dakota Department of Human Services,
such as temporary assistance to needy families, Medicaid, and foster care;

Child support will be established or modified, and an application was made and
accepted for services provided by the Child Support Division of the North Dakota
Department of Human Services; or

Child support or spousal support will be established or modified and North Dakota or
the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services is
required to be involved in proceedings related to support orders of other states or
countries under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.

WHAT IS THE NORTH DAKOTA RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT FOR A MOTION FOR 
AN INTERIM ORDER? 

The North Dakota residency requirement applies to the original domestic relations case that 
was started by the Plaintiff, but does not apply to the motion for an interim order itself. 

Thus, the Plaintiff, who filed the original domestic relations case, must have been a North 
Dakota resident for the required amount of time before filing. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 12 of 35 

Motion for Interim Order/Apr 2019 

For example: 

• Divorce and Separation – may not be granted, unless the plaintiff has been a resident of
North Dakota for six consecutive months before they commenced the court action.
• Parenting Rights and Responsibilities – a court has the ability to make an initial child
custody determination only if the state is the home of the child on the date that the
action is started, or was the home state of the child within six months before the action
was started, and the child is absent from the state, but a parent continues to live in this
state.

o Note: You should read and familiarize yourself with Section 14-14.1-12 of the

North Dakota Century Code.

• Paternity – the residency requirement for paternity is very complex. You should review
and familiarize yourself with Sections 14-20-36 through 14-20-40 of the North Dakota
Century Code to determine whether or not you meet the residency requirements.

EX-PARTE (EMERGENCY) MOTION FOR AN INTERIM ORDER 

This informational guide does not provide process information for making a motion for an ex-
parte interim order.  

A motion for an ex-parte interim order is sometimes referred to as an emergency and/or urgent 
motion. An ex-parte interim order is granted by a judge who makes a decision on your motion 
based only on your documents, affidavits of evidence, and without first holding the required 
hearing.   

Ex-parte interim orders will only be issued if a court thinks that there are exceptional 
circumstances present. 

For example: 

• A threat of imminent danger to someone or a minor child of such person,
•
If a court finds evidence that someone is in need of protection; and/or

Limited Legal Representation 

Lawyers licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that a lawyer 
can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the part of 
the case the lawyer handled.  For example: 

You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your
legal rights and responsibilities;

You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your legal documents, but attend
hearings yourself;

You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an
attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy;

You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make court
appearances for you.

You and the lawyer must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.

Review the North Dakota Rules of Evidence carefully: 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence governs whether or not your evidence will be admitted for 
consideration at the hearing. The Rules also govern how you object to evidence the Opposing 
Party wants to admit at the hearing. 

The starting point for admitting evidence at the hearing is whether the evidence is relevant. 
You must show a reasonable connection between the evidence you want the Judicial Officer to 
consider and the legal claim you are trying to prove. 

 

You should familiarize yourself with the North Dakota Rules of Evidence. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by scrolling to the 
“District Court Civil” section. 

Notice of Intent to Cross Examine Affidavit Witnesses:

If you require a witness to appear at the hearing or require production of documents, 
electronically stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District 
Court to issue a subpoena. Only a Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a 
subpoena.  

A Subpoena Informational Guide is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help by scrolling to 
the “District Court Civil” section. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you will need for the hearing: 

At minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. List the evidence you believe

PART TEN: THE EVIDENTIARY HEARING  

The evidentiary hearing is an examination of the facts and law, presided over by the Judicial 
Officer assigned to your case. 

The Moving Party and Opposing Party each have an opportunity to tell their side of the facts 
and argue how the laws apply to the situation. 

The Judicial Officer weighs the facts, evidence, and arguments presented by the Moving Party 
and Opposing Party and either grants or dismisses the motion for interim order.  

If you need special assistance at the hearing:  

If you have a disability, do not read or understand English well, or require special 
accommodations in the courtroom, contact the Clerk of District Court’s office as soon as 
possible.  

Do not be late: 

Do not be late for your evidentiary hearing. If you have a serious, unavoidable reason why you 
cannot go to the evidentiary hearing on the scheduled day or will be late, call the Clerk of 
District Court’s office as soon as possible.

decide to hold the evidentiary hearing without you.  

Bring the information, documents, etc. that you prepared for the hearing:  

Bring all of the files, paperwork, etc. that you gathered and organized while preparing for the 
evidentiary hearing.

that were submitted to the Clerk of District Court and identifying the names of 
the parties. 

•  Opening Statements: 

o

and how the Moving Party may respond to objections to their evidence.  

•  The Opposing Party has the Option to Cross-Examine the Moving Party’s Witnesses: 

o  After the Moving Party finishes direct questioning of their witnesses, the 

Opposing Party has the chance to ask these witnesses questions. This is called 
cross-examination. 
If the Moving Party testifies on their own behalf, the Opposing Party may cross-
examine the Moving Party. 

o 

o  The Opposing Party may only ask questions about the topics covered during the 

Moving Party’s direct questioning of the witnesses. 

•  The Opposing Party Presents their Case:  

o  The Opposing Party presents their evidence, including witnesses with first-hand 

knowledge. 

o  The Moving Party may object to the evidence presented by the Opposing Party.  

  The North Dakota Rules of Evidence govern how to object to evidence 

and how the Opposing Party may respond to objections to their evidence.

o  The Moving Party may only ask questions about the topics covered during the

an argument to the Judicial Officer on how the motion for interim order should 
be decided. 

The Judicial Officer May Decide the Interim Motion at the End of the Hearing OR Decide at a 
Later Date:

Officer may require the party who won the motion for interim order to prepare 
the interim motion order.

evidentiary hearing, the Judicial Officer will make a decision at a later date. If this 
is the case, both parties will receive the Judicial Officer’s decision in writing.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
