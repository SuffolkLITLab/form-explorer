      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE A MOTION TO AMEND PARENTING TIME (VISITATION) 
IN A NORTH DAKOTA STATE DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out any forms. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a 
lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

To protect your rights, carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re 
referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at www.ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities 
as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if 
these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota state district court to amend the parenting time 
provisions in a North Dakota state district court judgment.  There is no guarantee that all 
judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center.  The 
Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or 
information provided.  Use at your own risk. 

(In 2009 the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “visitation” to 
“parenting time” and changed the term “custody” to “residential responsibility.”)

Page 1 of 21 

Rev Aug 2021 

YOU MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS ONLY IF: 

1.  You have a North Dakota state district court judgment that gave you or the 

other party parenting time (visitation); 

AND 

2.  You want the Court to change, or amend, the parenting time (visitation) 

provisions in the judgment. 

YOU CAN’T USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS TO MODIFY PRIMARY 
RESIDENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CUSTODY). 

If you want to change, or modify, which parent has primary residential responsibility (custody) 
in your North Dakota state district court judgment, you can’t use this packet of forms. 

Go to www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/custody for all of the forms and guides available 
through the North Dakota Legal Self Help Center for modifying primary residential responsibility 
(custody) in a North Dakota state district court judgment. 

IF YOUR PARENTING TIME (VISITATION) SITUATION DOESN’T MEET 
THE REQUIREMENTS OF WHO MAY USE THIS PACKET OF FORMS: 

If your parenting time (visitation) situation doesn’t meet the requirements of who may use 
this packet of forms, neither the ND court system nor the ND Legal Self Help Center currently 
have other parenting time (visitation) packets of forms for you to use. 

However, requests to a North Dakota state district court are generally made by using a court 
process called a motion.  A motion is a set of written documents that include the request, or 
requests, the North Dakota laws and rules that support each request, and a proposed order you 
want the court to sign. 

If you decide to make your own motion that suits your parenting time (visitation) situation, a 
checklist and motion templates for creating your own motion documents are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/making-a-motion.

Opposing party: The other parent.  In other words, the parent who isn’t bringing the motion. 
(Also called the Non-moving party.) 

Real Party in Interest – (Also known as the Statutory Real Party in Interest.) The State of North 
Dakota is added as a real party in interest to family law actions only when:  

•  Child support will be established or modified, and a minor child receives assistance 

through programs administered by the North Dakota Department of Human Services, 
such as temporary assistance to needy families, Medicaid, and foster care;

•  Child support will be established or modified, and an application was made and 

 

accepted for services provided by the Child Support Division of the North Dakota 
Department of Human Services; or 

•  Child support or spousal support will be established or modified and North Dakota or 
the Child Support Division of the North Dakota Department of Human Services is 
required to be involved in proceedings related to support orders of other states or 
countries under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.

The North Dakota Rules of Court apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct.  See particularly:  

•  Rule 3.2 (Motions). 

The North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district 
courts.  The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp.  See 
particularly: 

•  Rule 5 (Service and Filing of Pleadings and Other Papers). 
•  Rule 6 (Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers). 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are found at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev. 

North Dakota case law (court decisions) is useful for interpreting what the law means for your 
individual circumstances. 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota State District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues. 

To research and view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov and click on 
“Supreme Court Opinions.” 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions).  Notes of case law (court decisions) 
related to North Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century 
Code.  Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are found in many North Dakota public 
and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

address.  If you know the opposing party is currently represented by a lawyer, address the 
envelope with the lawyer’s address.  List your address as the return address on the envelope. 

A person who is at least 18 years old takes the envelope to a United States Post Office and mails 
the envelope.  Postage must be prepaid. 

Service by mail is complete upon mailing. 

If You Have More than One Party to Serve: 

If you have more than one party to serve, you’ll need to arrange for service of copies of the 
above documents on each party.  You’ll need to provide proof of service on each party.

Step Six: 
Opposing Party has 14 or 17 Days to Answer. 

Opposing Party Has 14 or 17 Days to Serve and File an Answer Brief and Other Supporting 
Documentation: 

After the opposing party is served your motion documents, the opposing party has either 14 
days or 17 days to answer the motion in writing, depending on how you arranged for service.   

• 

• 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by personal delivery, or leaving 
them at the opposing party’s office or their lawyer’s office, the opposing party has 14 
days to answer your motion. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion to amend parenting time was 

personally delivered or left at the opposing party’s office or their lawyer’s office. 

If you arranged for service of your motion documents by mail or third-party commercial 
carrier, the opposing party has 17 days to answer your motion. 

o  The date of service is the date the motion to amend parenting time was mailed. 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday. 

If the opposing party doesn’t serve and file a written answer to your motion to modify primary 
residential responsibility, the judge or judicial referee may consider this an admission by the 
opposing party that your motion has merit.

Step Seven (A): 
If the Motion will be Decided on ONLY the Documents Filed with the Court, the 
Judge or Judicial Referee Reviews the Documents Without Holding a Hearing. 

After the deadline passes for motion documents and answer to motion documents to be 
served and filed, if neither party requested a hearing, the judge or judicial referee assigned to 
your case will review the motion documents filed by you and the opposing party. 

Your motion to amend the parenting time (visitation) provisions in your current judgment will 
be decided only on the documents filed with the court.  No in-person hearing will be held. 

If the opposing party didn’t serve and file an answer brief and supporting documents, your 
motion to amend parenting time (visitation) documents are still required to prove you meet the 
requirements to amend the parenting time (visitation) provisions in your current judgment.  

Step Seven (B): 
If You or the Opposing Party Requested a Hearing, Attend the Hearing. 

You must go to Court on the date set for the hearing. If you don’t go to Court, you’ll lose the 
case. Be sure to be on time. Bring to the hearing: 

•  Your copies of the completed forms you filed with the Clerk of Court’s Office; 
•  Any evidence you want the judge to know about (such as pictures, documents, receipts, 

bills, etc.); and 

•  Any witnesses you want to talk to the judge and anyone having signed an affidavit. 

The judge or judicial referee won’t allow you to use as evidence (and won’t look at) any 
documents (such as letters, notes, or statements) written by someone other than yourself 
unless the person who wrote the document is in Court at the hearing. 

If you want the judge to hear what someone else has to say about your case, that person MUST 
be in Court – YOU can’t tell the judge what that person said or has to say.  You may force 
someone to attend the hearing by serving a subpoena on that person prior to the date of the 
hearing. 

•  An Evidence Research Guide and a Subpoena Informational Guide are available at 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  Scroll to the “District Court Civil” Section.

Step Eight: 
The Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Amend the Judgment. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee DOESN’T Grant Your Motion to Amend Parenting Time: 

If the judge or judicial referee doesn’t grant your motion to amend parenting time, the current 
judgment remains in effect. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee GRANTS Your Motion to Amend Parenting Time: 

If the judge grants your motion to amend parenting time in your current judgment, the judge or 
judicial referee will sign an order amending the parenting time provisions in the current 
judgment. 

•  The judge or judicial referee may decide to sign your proposed order, or may decide to 

sign a different proposed order. 

After the judge or judicial referee signs the order amending the parenting time provisions in the 
current judgment, the clerk of district court will sign an amended judgment that incorporates 
all of the amendments approved by the judge or judicial referee. 

Your current judgment ISN’T AMENDED until the clerk of district court signs the amended 
judgment and files it in your case. 

You’ll receive a copy of the signed amended judgment.
