Important! Read Before Using This Packet of Forms. 

ND Legal Self Help staff and court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). If you’re 
unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

North Dakota Century Code § 12.1-31.2-01 allows a state's attorney to advise and assist any 
person in the preparation of documents necessary to secure a restraining order. There are 
limitations on the amount of assistance a state’s attorney may provide. 

You may seek assistance from a Certified Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Advocate for 
help filling out the forms.  Information about Certified Domestic Violence Sexual Assault 
Advocates is found on Pages 3-5 below. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about 
finding a lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including:

o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov.

Section 12.1-31-01.2 of the North Dakota Century Code governs sexual assault restraining 
orders in North Dakota. 

Rule 34 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules and Orders governs Certified 
Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Advocates. 

Who May Use this Packet? 

1.  Any adult (18 years old or older) who is a victim of sexual assault; or  

2.  The parent, step-parent, or guardian of a minor child (under 18 years of age) who the 
parent, step-parent, or guardian reasonably believes is a victim of sexual assault.   

Overview of the Sexual Assault Restraining Order Process 

Step 1: Petition Filed. The Petitioner completes and files a petition with the North Dakota State 
District Court requesting a sexual assault restraining order. 

Step 2: Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining Order Issued. The Judge or Judicial Referee may 
issue a temporary sexual assault restraining order if the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that the 
petition alleges reasonable grounds to believe the Respondent committed sexual assault. 

Step 3: Hearing Scheduled; Notice of Hearing Served. A hearing is scheduled on the petition for 
a sexual assault restraining order not later than fourteen (14) days after the court issues the 
temporary sexual assault restraining order. 

The Petitioner arranges for the Sheriff to serve the Respondent with the notice of the hearing 
and a copy of the petition. 

Step 4: Hearing Held. The hearing is held to decide whether the Judge or Judicial Referee will 
extend the temporary sexual assault restraining order and grant a sexual assault restraining 
order.  At the hearing, the Petitioner must show the Judge or Judicial Referee that there are 
reasonable grounds for the Judge or Judicial Referee to believe the sexual assault was 
committed by the Respondent. 

Step 5: Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant Sexual Assault Restraining Order. 
If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds that the Petitioner proved there are reasonable grounds to 
believe the Respondent committed sexual assault, the Judge or Judicial Referee may grant a 
sexual assault restraining order.  The sexual assault restraining order can’t last more than two 
years.

Step 2 – The Judge or Judicial Referee May Issue a Temporary Sexual 
Assault Restraining Order. 

After your Petition is accepted for filing by the Clerk of Court, the Clerk of Court forwards your 
petitioner to the Judge or Judicial Referee for review. 

The Judge or Judicial Referee reviews your petition to determine if the information you 
included is enough to find there are reasonable grounds to believe the Respondent engaged 
committed sexual assault. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee finds reasonable grounds to believe the Respondent 
committed sexual assault, the Judge or Judicial Referee signs a Temporary Sexual Assault 
Restraining Order. 

The Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining Order must include the following: 

•  Prohibiting the Respondent from harassing, stalking, or threatening the individual 

•  Prohibiting the Respondent from appearing at the individual's residence, school, and 

requesting the order; 

place of employment; and 

•  Prohibiting the Respondent from contacting the individual requesting the order. 

The Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining Order may only be entered against the Respondent. 

The Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining Order is in effect until one of the following happens: 

•  The Judge or Judicial Referee grants a more permanent Sexual Assault Restraining Order 

after the hearing is held; 

•  The Judge or Judicial Referee ends the Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining Order 

before the hearing is held (usually with a new written order); or 
•  After the hearing, the Judge or Judicial Referee dismisses your case. 

(This space left intentionally blank.)

Step 3 – The Hearing is Scheduled; Petitioner Arranges for the Sheriff 
to Serve the Temporary Order & Notice of Hearing on the 
Respondent. 

The District Court will schedule a time and date for the hearing on your Petition. The hearing 
will be scheduled within 14 days of the approval of the Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining 
Order. 

If service can’t be made on the Respondent, the court may set a new hearing date. 

The Petitioner must arrange for the sheriff to service copies of the following on the 
Respondent: 

•  The Notice of Hearing; and 
•  The Temporary Sexual Assault Restraining Order. 

o  The Notice of Hearing may be combined with the Temporary Order. 

Give the Sheriff the Respondent’s full name and current location. If you don’t know, make sure 
you give the Sheriff all of the information you know about the Respondent. If the Sheriff can’t 
find the Respondent, they may not be able to complete service. 

If the Respondent is a minor (less than 18 years old), the Respondent’s parents must also be 
served. In addition to the Respondent’s information, give the Sheriff the full names and current 
locations of the Respondent’s parents.  

Step 4 – Attend the Hearing. 

You must attend at the hearing. If you’re working with a Certified Domestic Violence Sexual 
Assault Advocate, the advocate can attend the hearing with you. 

At the hearing, you must prove the facts you included in your petition. 

If you have any witnesses to the facts you included in your Petition, you may bring the 
witnesses with you to the hearing.   

The hearing also gives the Respondent the opportunity to give their side of the story and 
present any witnesses to the facts you included in your Petition. 

At the hearing, the Judge or Judicial Referee will determine whether the Temporary Order 
should be extended and whether a Sexual Assault Restraining Order should be issued for a set 
period of time. The set period of time can’t be for more than two (2) years. 

NDLSHC

SARO Instructions/Rev. Nov 2022 

Step 5 – The Judge or Judicial Referee Decides Whether to Grant the 
Sexual Assault Restraining Order. 

After the hearing is held, if the Judge or Judicial Referee finds reasonable grounds to believe the 
Respondent committed sexual assault, the Judge or Judicial Referee signs a Sexual Assault 
Restraining Order. The Order can’t last more than 2 years. 

The Clerk of Court sends a copy of the Sexual Assault Restraining Order to the local law 
enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the residence of the victim. 

The Sexual Assault Restraining Order is served on the Respondent by the Sheriff. 

Report any violations of the Order immediately to local law enforcement. 

If the Judge or Judicial Referee decides that you didn’t prove the facts you listed in your 
petition, the case is dismissed and the Temporary Order is no longer in effect.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
