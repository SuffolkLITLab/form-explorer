      <pre>Instructions for Making a Motion to Remove Visitation, 
Communication, or Interaction Restrictions with a Ward 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

Carefully read this information and any instructions to which you’re referred. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. If you’re unsure if these forms 
and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

•  For more information about finding a lawyer, ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
process for asking a North Dakota state district court to remove visitation, communication, or 
interaction restrictions put in place by the guardian(s) of a Ward. There’s no guarantee that all 
judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center 
isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or information provided.  

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms. 

Use at your own risk.

MP Instructions: Aug 2021 

CAUTION!  Read BEFORE You Start! 

Guardians are allowed to restrict visitation, communication, and interaction with the Ward, 
as long as the restrictions are in the best interests of the Ward. 

There’s NO guarantee that using these forms and following these instructions will result in 
the Court removing the restrictions.  These forms give you the basic process and formatting for 
this type of motion.  Ultimately, it’s up to you to prove to the judge or judicial referee in writing 
and at the hearing that removing the restrictions is in the best interests of the Ward. 

If the judge or judicial referee decides that your request is frivolous, you’ll be court ordered 
to pay the Guardian’s attorney fees.  The North Dakota Supreme Court has defined “frivolous” 
to mean there’s “such a complete absence of actual facts or law a reasonable person could not 
have expected a court would render a judgment in that person’s favor.” (Rath v. Rath, 2016 ND 
46.) 

Who May Use this Packet of Forms? 

These forms may be used by: 

•  The Ward; 
•  A family member; 
•  A clergy member;  
•  A lawyer retained by the Ward; 
•  An agency charged with the protection of vulnerable adults; OR 
•  An interested person 

to ask the North Dakota State District Court with authority over the guardianship to remove 
visitation, communication, or interaction restrictions with the Ward that were put in place by 
the Guardian(s) appointed by the court. 

What if I Don’t Meet the Requirements to Use this Packet of Forms? 

Forms for common and uncomplicated matters that may be come up throughout a 
guardianship of an adult are found at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-guardianship.  Forms 
aren’t available for every situation or circumstance. 

If you don’t find a form that suits your circumstances at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-
guardianship, a form isn’t available.  You may wish to consult a lawyer to help you decide what 
to do next.

What Are the Steps to Ask a District Court to Remove Visitation, 
Communication, or Interaction Restrictions? 

Step One: 

The Restricted Party Completes All 5 of the Forms 

Step Two: 

The Restricted Party Arranges Service of Copies of All 5 of the Completed 
Forms on the Guardian(s), Ward, Ward’s Spouse, and All Interested Persons 
The Guardian has 14 or 17 days to answer the motion in writing. 

Step Three: 

The Restricted Party Files the Originals of All Forms with the Clerk of Court 

Step Four: 

The Restricted Party Prepares Their Case 

Step Five: 

A Hearing is Held Before the District Court Makes a Decision Based on the 
Documents Filed and the Evidence Presented at the Hearing 

Step Six: 

Findings of Fact and Order is Issued by the District Court: 
•  The District Court may keep the restrictions in place without change; 
•  The District Court may keep restrictions in place, but either increase or 

decrease the restrictions; OR 

•  The District Court may remove the restrictions completely. 

You May Request an Emergency Hearing to Remove Visitation, 
Communication, or Interaction Restrictions 

A hearing to present evidence is required before the judge or judicial referee can make a 
decision on whether you’ve proven it’s in the Ward’s best interests that restrictions should be 
removed. 

In general, these types of hearings are scheduled according to each District Court’s regular 
calendaring process.  Expect hearings to be scheduled a minimum of 3-6 months in the future.  
Depending on caseloads, your hearing may be scheduled more than 6 months in the future. 

IMPORTANT: If the Ward’s health is in significant decline, or if the Ward’s death may be 
imminent you may request an emergency hearing. 

The District Court isn’t required to grant this request and will only schedule an emergency 
hearing if you include sufficient information in your affidavit in support of the motion showing 
the Ward’s health is in significant decline, or the Ward is close to death.

What Laws and Rules Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet? 

Section 30.1-28-12.2 of the North Dakota Century Code governs motions for removing 
restrictions on visitation, communication, and interaction with a Ward. 

Rule 3.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court governs motions in North Dakota state district 
court cases. 

Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure governs service of motion documents filed 
in a District Court guardianship case. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota 
law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

What Definitions Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet of Forms? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they’re NOT intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Guardian (or Co-Guardians) – An individual or nonprofit corporation appointed by a North 
Dakota state district court to make personal decisions for the Ward.

interview. 

Interested Person – Includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any 
others having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a Ward.  
Interested persons are usually listed in the findings and order appointing the Guardian(s). 

Judicial Referee – A judicial officer, appointed by the presiding District Court judge, who has the 
authority to preside in Juvenile Court proceedings.  The findings and order of the judicial 
referee have the effect of the findings and order of a District Court judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court judge. 

NDLSHC 

[Page 4 of 17] 

MP Instructions: Aug 2021 

Motion – A written request to a North Dakota state district court to issue an order for a specific 
purpose.  For example, a written request for an order removing visitation, communication, or 
interactions restrictions between the Restricted Party and the Ward.

motion.

Restricted Party – (See also Moving Party) The person on whom the Ward’s Guardian placed

A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide Your Motion 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows adult guardianship 
cases in District Court to be heard and decided by a judicial referee, rather than a District Court 
judge. 

If a judicial referee is assigned to the guardianship case, any party to the case may request that 
a District Court judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the guardianship case is heard and decided by a judicial referee, the judicial referee will issue 
findings of fact and an order.  The judicial referee’s findings of fact and order have the same 
effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court judge until superseded (replaced) by a 
written order of a District Court judge. 

If any party to the guardianship case wants a review of the judicial referee’s findings of fact and 
order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for the 
review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review. 

The party requesting the review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

STEP FOUR: Prepare Your Case 

Prepare your case for the evidentiary hearing. 

You, the Moving Party (Restricted Party), must prove what you typed or wrote in your motion 
documents. 

Caution! Preparing for a hearing is often a complex and confusing process. You’re held to the 
same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, even if don’t understand the rules or 
procedures. 

You’ll need to conduct additional research to prepare for the hearing. 

Subpoenas: Review Rule 45 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure carefully!  If you 
require a witness to appear at the hearing or require production of documents, electronically 
stored information or other tangible things, you may need the Clerk of District Court to issue a 
subpoena.  Only a Clerk of District Court or a lawyer for a party may issue a subpoena. 

More information about subpoenas is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/subpoenas. 

Evidence: You’re required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your 
own evidence and when objecting to the evidence presented by other parties. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

You may also wish to review the guides for self-represented individuals for gathering and 
presenting evidence at rcdvcpc.org/resources/self-represented-litigants-series.html. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available. 

ODIN is a shared library database of many North Dakota academic, public, state agency, and 
special libraries.  Search ODIN for resources that may be available in a North Dakota library 
near you.  (polaris.odinlibrary.org) 

If the book is available for interlibrary loan through ODIN, ask the librarian or library staff of 
your local North Dakota library how to request the book. 

Following are a selection of library resources on ODIN that may be of interest to you:

STEP FIVE: A Hearing is Held Before the District Court Makes a Decision 

If the Hearing will be Held in Person, Attend the Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a request form is available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

Be prepared to prove everything you typed or wrote in your motion documents. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. See Step 4 for 
more information. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

If your hearing is in-person at the courthouse, arrive early so you don’t miss your hearing date 
and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to court on the date and time 
scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

If the Hearing will by Held by Zoom, Make Sure You Can Connect to the Zoom Hearing: 

If your hearing is held electronically by Zoom, well before the hearing begins, make sure you 
can connect and understand how to function in Zoom. 

Don’t be late to the Zoom hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t attend 
the hearing on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge, or judicial referee, hears both sides and then issues the findings of fact and order.  
Sometimes, the findings of fact and order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the 
findings of fact and order is issued at a later date. 

NDLSHC 

[Page 16 of 17] 

MP Instructions: Aug 2021 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Moving Party (Restricted 

Party) goes first. 

•  Moving Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Moving Party presents their case first. The Guardian(s) may cross-examine 

witnesses and object to the Moving Party’s evidence. 

•  Guardian(s) Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Guardian(s) presents their case after the Moving Party.  The Moving Party 

may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Guardian’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Guardian(s) goes first. 

Before You Leave the Courthouse:  

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP SIX: Findings of Fact and Order 

Until the judge or judicial referee signs an order deciding what to do with the restrictions put in 
place by the Guardian(s), the restrictions remain in place. 

After the judge or judicial referee reviews all documents filed and following the evidentiary 
hearing, the judge or judicial referee will make a decision and issue findings of fact and an 
order. 

You’ll receive a copy of the Findings of Fact and Order signed and dated by the judge or judicial 
referee by mail or email. 

Based on all documents filed and the evidence presented at the hearing, the judge or judicial 
referee may order any of the following: 

•  Keep the restrictions in place without change; 
•  Keep restrictions in place, but either increase or decrease the restrictions; OR 
•  Remove the restrictions completely. 

 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.

FACTS 

4. 

The facts are stated in the Affidavit in Support of Motion to Remove Visitation, 

Communication, or Interaction Restrictions, which is filed with the Motion and incorporated by 

reference. 

LAW AND ARGUMENT 

5. 

When a Guardian restricts visitation, communication, or interaction between a 

restricted party and a Ward, Section 30.1-28-12.2 of the North Dakota Century Code (N.D.C.C.) 

allows the District Court to remove unreasonable or arbitrary restrictions on visitation, 

communication or interaction. 

6. 

The Guardian is unreasonably or arbitrarily denying or restricting visitation, 

communication, or interaction between the Moving Party and the Ward.  The Guardian’s 

restrictions on visitation, communication or interaction between the Moving Party and the 

Ward are not in the best interests of the Ward.  This is supported by the facts stated in the 

Affidavit in Support of Motion to Remove Visitation, Communication, or Interaction 

7. 

The Moving party requests that the court grant the Moving Party reasonable visitation, 

communication, or interaction with the Ward. 

Restrictions.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
