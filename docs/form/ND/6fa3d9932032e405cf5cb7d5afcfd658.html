      <pre>Instructions to Answer a Motion to Prohibit Public Access to Court 
Case Records – in a Civil or Criminal Case 

Important! Read Before Using These Forms and Instructions 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and court employees can’t help you fill out forms. Carefully read 
this information and any instructions to which you’re referred. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. If you’re unsure if these forms and instructions suit your 
circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

For information about how to find a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer. 

As a self-represented individual, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
process for answering a motion to a North Dakota state district court to prohibit public access to 

the entire court case, to specific documents filed in the court case, or to redact (block from view) 

information within documents filed in the court case. There’s no guarantee that all judges and 

courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center isn’t 

responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or information provided. 

Use at your own risk.

(See Page 9 for more information about calculating these deadlines.) 

What Rules Do You Need to Know to Use this Packet? 

Rule 41, Section 4(a) of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules are the rules that 
apply to requests to prohibit public access to records in a civil or criminal court case in North 
Dakota state district court. 

Rule 3.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court is the rule that applies motions in civil and criminal

Caution!   A self-represented individual may only represent themselves when using this 

packet of forms. An individual can perform the functions of a lawyer for themselves at their 
own risk. This is called legal self-representation.   

•  An individual can’t delegate legal self-representation to a non-lawyer.  Legal documents 
signed by a non-lawyer on behalf of a self-represented individual are considered void. 

Motions to Prohibit Public Access Don’t Expunge (Delete) the North 
Dakota State District Court Case Records 

Even if public access to all or part of an individual’s civil or criminal court case records is 
prohibited by the district court, the court’s order doesn’t delete (expunge) the information 
from the court case record or the records kept by any other government entity or private 
entity. 

If the district court orders the entire case or documents within a case to be prohibited 
from public access, the court may order access to the case or documents upon request.  
(The request is made by written motion under Rule 41, Section 4(b) of the North Dakota 
Supreme Court Administrative Rules.) 

If the district court orders redaction (blocked from view) of information within a 
document in the case, the redacted information is included on a Confidential 
Information Form filed in the court case.  The Confidential Information Form is only 
accessible to the court and parties. 

If you wish to research expungement or sealing criminal record options in North Dakota, go to 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help and scroll to the “Miscellaneous” section.

Before Completing and Signing the Forms 

Review the forms carefully and decide if the forms apply to your situation.  If you don’t know 
if you should use these forms, consult a lawyer who is licensed to practice in North Dakota and 
can agree to represent you. 

When you sign the forms, your signature tells the Court that you: 

•  Made reasonable inquiries about the motion requirements; and  
•  Based on your inquiries, to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief: 

o  You aren’t presenting the motion for any improper purpose, such as to harass, 

cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; 

o  The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions in the motion are warranted 
by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or 
reversing existing law or for establishing new law; 

o  The facts you present in the motion are supported by evidence or will likely have 
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or 
discovery; and 

o  Denials of any facts in the motion are warranted on the evidence or are 

reasonably based on belief or a lack of information. 

See North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11 for signature requirements, representations 
to the Court, and sanctions for motions and other documents presented to a Court. 

Including Protected Information When You Fill Out the Forms 

When you file this answer to motion with the North Dakota state district court, all 
documents, except Form 10: Confidential Information Form, are available to the publicto 
view.   

Court case records are generally available to the public, and anyone can request to look in 
almost any court file. However, certain information is protected and required to remain 
confidential, even if the protected information is part of a public court case record.

Protected Information is: 

•  Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number. 
•  Birthdates. 
•  Minor child’s name. 

o  However, if the minor child is a party in the case, the minor child’s full name isn’t 
protected information. For example, in a case to change a minor child’s name or 
appoint a conservator for the minor child, the child’s full name must appear. 

•  Financial account number. 
•  Victim contact information in a criminal or delinquency case, if the victim requests. 

o  Victim contact information means any information that would allow someone to 

make contact. Contact information includes, but isn’t limited to, names, 
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, or places of employment. 

You may need to refer to Protected Information when you fill out the forms.  When you fill 
out the forms, write or type ONLY: 

•  The last four (4) digits of the social security number and taxpayer identification number. 
•  The year of birth. 
•  The minor child’s initials. 
•  The last four (4) digits of the financial-account number. 
•  “Victim contact information” to refer to victim contact information in a criminal or 

delinquency case. 

The district court still needs to have access to the full Protected Information.  Complete Form 
10: Confidential Information Form with the full Protected Information you reference in the 
forms. 

Form 10: Confidential Information Form is filed as a confidential document and isn’t available to 
the public to view.

Steps to Prepare, Serve and File the Forms in the Packet 

STEP 1: You, the Opposing Party, Calculate your Deadline to Answer the Motion 

You have 14 calendar days to answer if you were served the motion to prohibit public access by 
personal delivery or at your office. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion to prohibit public access was personally 

delivered or left at your office. 

You have 17 calendar days to answer if you were served the motion to prohibit public access by 
mail or third party commercial carrier. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion to prohibit public access was mailed. 
•  Keep the envelope with the postmarked date for reference. 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the date of service; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday.  

If you, the opposing party, don’t serve and file a written answer to the motion to prohibit public 
access, the judge or judicial referee may consider this an admission by you, the opposing party, 
that the motion to prohibit public access has merit. 

STEP 2: You, the Opposing Party, Prepare the Answer Forms 

Form 7: Answer Brief to Motion to Prohibit Public Access 
This is the required written document where you, the opposing party, make your written

motion to the judge or judicial referee for review.   

STEP 5: Review of the Court   

If the Motion is Granted: If the district court decides there are reasonable grounds to prohibit 
public access, the judge or judicial referee signs a Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
