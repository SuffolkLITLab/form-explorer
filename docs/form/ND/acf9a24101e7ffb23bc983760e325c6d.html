      <pre>Instructions to Make a Motion to Hold a Hearing by Reliable Electronic 
Means or Appear at the Hearing by Reliable Electronic Means 

Important! Read Before Using this Packet of Forms. 

ND Legal Self Help staff and court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s). If you’re 
unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about finding a 
lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
procedure for asking a North Dakota district court in a conservatorship case to hold a hearing by 
reliable electronic means, or to allow you, another party, or a witness to appear at a hearing by 
reliable electronic means. There’s no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms 
available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any 
consequences that may result from the forms or information provided.  

Use these forms and instructions at your own risk. 

NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 1 of 7]  

Instructions/Rev Dec 2022 

Rule 52 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules gives the requirements for 
making a motion to ask a judge or judicial referee to hold a hearing by reliable electronic 
means, or to allow you or another party or witness to appear at the hearing by reliable 
electronic means, instead of in person. 

•  Review Rule 52 carefully! Effective December 1, 2022, Rule 52 doesn’t require a notice 

of motion or a supporting brief. 

What is a Motion to Conduct a Hearing or Appear by Reliable 
Electronic Means? 

Often, hearings in conservatorship cases are held in a courthouse. This means that all of the 
people who are required to appear at the hearing must go to the courthouse in person. 

However, when anyone required to appear at the hearing has a reason (or reasons) they can’t 
go to the courthouse in person, they may ask the court for permission to: 

1.  Hold the hearing by reliable electronic means, instead of in person at the courthouse; or 
2.  Allow you, another party, or witness to appear at the hearing by reliable electronic 

means, instead of in person at the courthouse. 

Examples of reliable electronic means include, but aren’t limited to, Zoom, telephone, or 
Interactive Video Network (IVN). 

The judge or judicial referee decides whether to hold the hearing by reliable electronic means, 
or to allow the party or their witness(es) to appear by reliable electronic means. 

The Conservator (or Proposed Conservator) Makes this Motion 

The conservator, or proposed conservator, in a conservatorship case may use this set of 
forms. You may ask for one or both options. If you choose both options, the form set allows 
you to your preference. 

The conservator, or proposed conservator, is also called the Moving Party. 

•  The Moving Party may be either the Plaintiff or the Defendant in the civil action. 

The other people who are required to appear at the hearing are called the Non-moving Parties. 
(Also called the Opposing Parties.) The Non-moving Parties may choose to respond in writing to 
this motion. 

NDLSHC/Appear Reliable Electronic Means 

[Page 2 of 7]  

Instructions/Rev Dec 2022 

Before You Start, You Must Try to Contact the Non-moving Parties! 

Before you serve or file the Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic 
Means, you must attempt to contact the Non-moving Parties to find out if they agree or object 
to your motion. 

Carefully review Paragraph 4 of Form 1: Motion. Paragraph 4 lists the people who are required 
to receive notice of hearing in a conservatorship case. The people you need to attempt to 
contact will depend on the circumstances of the conservatorship. 

You can still make your motion even if you’re unable to contact all of the Non-moving Parties, 
or if any Non-moving Parties object to your motion. You’ll use Form 1: Motion to tell the judge 
or judicial referee if you were able to contact each Non-moving Party and, if so, whether they 
agree or disagree. 

What Are the Deadlines for this Motion? 

The Moving Party, must serve the motion documents on all other parties at least seven (7) 
days before the hearing, trial, or other proceeding. 

•  See Step 2 on Pages 6-7 for information on service. 

If a Non-moving Party chooses to respond, they must serve their written response to the 
motion at least four (4) days before the hearing, trial, or other proceeding. 

•  Non-moving Parties may choose not to respond. The judge or judicial referee will make 

a decision based on the documents filed by the Moving Party. 

These time requirements may be shortened by the judge or judicial referee if you have a good 
reason. This is also referred to as having good cause. 

If a Moving Party wants to make a request to shorten the time requirements, Form 1: Motion 
includes the option to make this request.

If you’re asking the judge or judicial referee to shorten the time the requirement, state your

Instructions/Rev Dec 2022 

Step 2 – Serve Completed Form 1 and Form 2 on All Other Parties. 

Service is providing copies of your completed motion documents on all Non-moving Parties. The 
judge or judicial referee won’t act on your motion documents until you file proof of service with 
the court.  A declaration of service is your proof of service. 

Make at least two copies of the following completed forms: 

•  Form 1: Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic Means; and 
•  Form 2: Order on Motion to Conduct Hearing or Appear by Reliable Electronic Means 

(Proposed). 

Keep one copy for your records. You’ll arrange to serve the other copy or copies on Non-moving 
Parties. You’ll file the original with the Clerk of Court in Step 3. 

Arrange to serve the copies on all other parties by mail: 

•  Put the copies in an envelope. 
•  Address the envelope with the Non-moving Party’s last known address. 
• 

If you know the Non-moving Party is currently represented by a lawyer, address the 
envelope with the lawyer’s address. 

•  List your address as the return address on the envelope. 
•  Put the correct first class postage on the envelope. 

o  Postage must be prepaid. 
o 

It’s very important to put the correct postage on the envelope. If you don’t, the 
envelope may be returned to you causing you to miss the service deadline. 

•  Service by mail is complete upon mailing. 

The person who mailed the envelope(s) completes the following form: 

•  Form 3: Declaration of Service by Mail. 

The person who mailed the envelope must complete the Declaration of Service by Mail form.  
(If the envelope is mailed at a United States Post Office, the United States Post Office employee 
doesn’t complete Declaration of Service by Mail form.) 

Complete the Caption exactly as the Caption of the Motion form is filled out. 

•  Follow the directions on the form. 
•  Make ONE COPY of the completed, dated, and signed Declaration of Service by Mail 

form for your records.

[Page 6 of 7]  

Instructions/Rev Dec 2022

to serve your documents. 

To the review other service options, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/service-in-a-civil-action. 
Scroll to the “Service After a District Court Civil Action Has Started” section of the webpage.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
