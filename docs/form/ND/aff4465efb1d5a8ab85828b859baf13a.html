      <pre>EMANCIPATION 

A Research Guide for a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide is intended as a starting point for your research 
into Emancipation.  The information provided in this research guide is not intended for legal 
advice and cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

OVERVIEW OF EMANCIPATION: 

What is emancipation? 

The act of allowing a minor child to gain independence and take on the full responsibilities of an 
adult. 

What is the age of majority? 

The age of majority in North Dakota is 18 years of age, meaning at the age of 18 a minor child 
has reached the age of an adult and is no longer under the authority of the parent. 

Emancipation by a North Dakota court prior to reaching the age of majority? 

North Dakota does not have an established civil court process to ask a state court to 
emancipate a minor child. 

When does a parent’s authority over a child end? 

•  After reaching the age of majority. 
•  When the minor child is married before the age of majority (with parental consent). 
•  When a court appoints a guardian for the minor child. 

What can a minor do without parental consent? 

•  Work 
•  Consent to SOME medical treatments 
•  Enter into many, but not all, contracts 
•  Bring suit (may sue or be sued)

COURT PROCESS AND FORMS FOR EMANCIPATION: 

The ND Legal Self Help Center does not have forms or instructions available for asking a court to 
emancipate a minor. 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff is unable to identify an established civil court process for asking 
a court to emancipate a minor.  You may wish to research further yourself, or consult an 
attorney licensed to practice in North Dakota.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal  the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to emancipation, is to use the print version of the North 
Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each Section of the Century 
Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the Century Code 
Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the “Opinions” 
link and enter the case name or case citation. 

NORTH DAKOTA COURT RULES: 

Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is conducted.  All 
of the court rules are found online at http://www.ndcourts.gov/Rules/.

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE THROUGH LEGISLATION, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES 
AND RULINGS, AND COURT DECISIONS.   

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rules and rulings, and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North 
Dakota law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions 
of the North Dakota Century Code and North Dakota court rules are found in many North 
Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

represent yourself, you must follow all of the rules, laws and procedures that an attorney is 
required to follow.

Limited Legal Representation 

Attorneys licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an 
attorney can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the 
part of the case the attorney handled.  For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
