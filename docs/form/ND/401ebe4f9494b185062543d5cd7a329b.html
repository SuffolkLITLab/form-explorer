      <pre>WILL RESEARCH GUIDE 

A Legal Research Guide for North Dakota Wills 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. 

The information provided in this research guide ISN’T a complete statement of the law.  This 
information is intended as a starting point for your legal research into wills. 

This information isn’t intended for legal advice and can’t replace the advice of competent legal 
counsel licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota. 

The self-represented individual must make ALL decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references doesn’t mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

NO WILL FORMS AVAILABLE 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center and the North Dakota Court System don’t have forms 
or instructions available specifically for a Will. 

If you represent yourself, you’ll need to create your own legal documents, or retain a lawyer 
to do so. 

Many public and academic libraries have subscriptions to forms services, which are available 
to library patrons.  You may wish to contact your local public or academic library and ask if they 
have access to any legal forms services that include will forms. 

If you decide to use a will form available through a forms service, you’ll need to independently 
determine if the will form is legally sufficient for North Dakota and suitable for your 
circumstances. 

Center staff can’t tell you if a will form is legally sufficient for North Dakota or suitable for 
you.  This requires legal advice, which isn’t available from the Center under any circumstances. 

If you’re interested in finding a lawyer to prepare your will, go to Page 7 for all of the lawyer 
resources available through the ND Legal Self Help Center. 

If you’d like to learn more about finding a lawyer to represent you, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-
self-help/finding-a-lawyer.

Wills/Dec 2021 

OVERVIEW OF WILLS 

A Will is a written document executed by an individual in which assets are left to named 
persons or entities. 

An adult (18 years of age older) who is of sound mind may make a Will. 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-08-02(1) requires that a Will must be: 

What is a Will?  

Who can make a Will? 

How is a Will executed? 

1.  Written; 
2.  Signed by either: 

3.  Signed by either: 

a.  The testator (the person making the will); or 
b.  An individual signing in the testator's name, as long as the signature happens in 
the testator's conscious presence and at the direction of the testator; and 

a.  At least two individuals, who witnessed the testator sign the will, or after the 
testator acknowledged to them that the document is the testator’s will; or 
b.  A notary public, after the testator acknowledged to them that the document is 

the testator’s will. 

What are the requirements for a Holographic Will? 

North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-08-02(2) requires that a Holographic Will must be 
hand written by the testator and dated and signed by the testator. 

A Holographic Will isn’t required to be witnessed, but if the authenticity of a Holographic Will is 
challenged, individuals who witnessed the testator’s signature may testify to its authenticity. 

Who may witness a Will? 

Any person generally competent to be a witness may act as a witness to a will. 

Do I file my Will with the District Court? 

No.  There is no requirement in North Dakota to file your Will with the District Court while 
you’re still alive.  The Court will only accept the Will as part of a case to validate your Will, or as 
part of a probate case upon your death.

Wills/Dec 2021 

Can I file my Will with a North Dakota County Recorder? 

You may, but you’re not required to.  If you would like to have your Will filed, North Dakota law 
allows you to deposit your Will with a North Dakota County Recorder for safe-keeping.   

Once the Will is deposited, and while you’re still alive, the deposited will is only delivered to 
you, the person who made the Will, or to a person authorized in writing, signed by you. 

Where should I keep my Will? 

Keep your will in a safe, accessible place. 

Be sure the executor you named in your Will (the person in charge of winding up your affairs) 
knows where it is. 

You may wish to give your named executor a copy or copies of your Will. 

Can I keep my Will in my safety deposit box? 

You may keep your Will in your safety deposit box.  However, after your death it may be 
difficult for people to access your safety deposit box. 

If you choose to keep your Will in your safety deposit box, you may wish to authorize someone 
else to have access to your safety deposit box. 

When does a Will become effective? 

A Will becomes effective upon the death of the person who made the Will. 

Can I ask a North Dakota state district court to declare my Will is valid before I die? 

Yes, North Dakota law allows you, the person who made the Will, to ask a North Dakota state 
district court to declare your Will is valid before you die. 

The Will is filed with the North Dakota State District Court as part of the case. 

If the Will isn’t sealed by the court, the Will is a public court record.

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW  
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota state district court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

Case law is a useful legal research tool for determining what a law means. 

You may research North Dakota Supreme Court case law related to wills by searching by topic 
at ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Supreme Court Opinions” link, the “By Topic” link, and then on 
the link for “Probate-Wills-Trusts.” 

You may also search for keywords within North Dakota Supreme Court case law.  Go to 
ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme Court Opinions” link and enter the keywords into the 
“Enter query” text box.  Then, click on the “Search” button.  North Dakota Supreme Court 
opinions containing your keywords will be listed on the page. 

Another way to research North Dakota Supreme Court case law related to wills, is to use the 
print version of the North Dakota Century Code to locate the short summaries of case law after 
each Section of the Century Code.  Case law summaries directly follow the text of the Century 
Code Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to ndcourts.gov, click on the “Supreme 
Court Opinions” link and enter the case name or case citation.  

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE    

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, court rules, 
administrative rules and rulings, and case law. 

If you need assistance determining whether specific laws, rules or case law apply to your 
situation, or determining how they apply to your situation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice 
in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you. 

Only a lawyer who has agreed to represent you can give you legal advice.  Legal advice includes 
interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your circumstances.
