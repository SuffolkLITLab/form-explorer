      <pre>Legal Research Guide & Checklist 

This is a basic step by step guide & checklist to legal research. This guide and checklist is 
meant to be printed and used for note-taking while you conduct your legal research. 

Use this guide & checklist along with the legal research resources available at the North 
Dakota Supreme Court Law Library webpage and in the Legal Research section of the 
North Dakota Legal Self Help Center webpage. 

Before you start your legal research, you should know the basic difference between 
substantive law and procedural law. 

•  Substantive law is the law that establishes our legal rights and responsibilities and 
grants jurisdiction (authority) to a court to hear and decide a case. Substantive law 
includes the North Dakota Constitution, laws (statutes) enacted by the North Dakota 
State Legislature, and the case law (opinions) of the North Dakota Supreme Court.   

Substantive law answers questions like: 

o  Can I get a divorce in North Dakota? How are property and debt divided in a 

divorce? 

o  Can I ask a North Dakota state court to establish custody and visitation? What 

reasons will the court use to decide who gets primary custody? 

o  Can I sue someone who owes me money in North Dakota Small Claims court? 
o  What are my rights and responsibilities as a tenant or a landlord? What are 

the reasons a landlord can evict a tenant? 

•  Procedural law is the law that governs the process of bringing a case to court and 
how the case proceeds once it gets to court. Procedural law is found in the court 
rules enacted by the North Dakota Supreme Court, including the North Dakota Rules 
of Civil Procedure and the North Dakota Rules of Evidence. 

Procedural law answers questions like: 

o  How do I start a civil case and what legal documents do I need? 
o  How do I subpoena documents or a witness for my hearing? 
o  What kind of evidence can I present and how do I present my evidence? 
o  How do I ask the court to modify an order in an existing case? 

Depending on your legal question or issue, you may need to research either the 
substantive law, or the procedural law, or both.

STEP ONE: What is the Legal Question/Legal Issue I Want to Answer? 

Legal Question/Legal Issue: (Write down your question or issue.) 

Relevant Facts: (Write a short summary of the circumstances related to your legal question.) 

eywords: (List words related to your legal questions/legal issue to use as search terms.) 

s this a substantive law issue, procedural law issue, or both: (If you know the answer to this 
question, this can help you narrow the focus of your legal research. If you don’t know the 
answer, the following steps may help you figure out the answer.)

STEP TWO: Research Secondary Sources of Law to Find out More 
(Secondary sources of law explain the law, help you identify additional legal terms related to your issue, 
and help you identify primary sources of law for Step Three. You may not find a secondary source exactly 
related to your issue, but this step may help you identify other related issues you may need to address. 
You may also search for your keywords in the printed General Index of the North Dakota Century Code.)

STEP THREE: Find Primary Sources of Law Related to My Question/Issue 
(Primary sources of law are the law itself. Mandatory primary sources are the laws a court must follow.  
Persuasive primary sources are the laws a court may choose to follow, but doesn’t have to follow.) 

List the Court(s) that are mandatory for your legal issue. (Review Table T1 of “The Bluebook: A Uniform 
System of Citation.”) 

Mandatory Statutes and/or Rules & Regulations: (North Dakota state courts deciding North Dakota 
state law issues must follow the statutes in the North Dakota Century Code, and the rules and 
regulations in the North Dakota Administrative Code.) 

Persuasive Statutes and/or Regulations: (Statutes and regulations of other states are not binding on 
North Dakota state courts, including the North Dakota Supreme Court. However, persuasive statutes 
and/or regulations may be useful to add support to a legal argument. You may not need persuasive 
primary sources.)

Mandatory Statutory 
Research 

(If a topic or subject 
index is available, look 
for your keywords.  
Then, review the 
statutes associated with 
your keywords.) 

Mandatory Rules 
and/or Regulations 

(If your issue involves an 
administrative 
(executive branch) 
agency, review that 
agency’s rules and 
regulations.)

a mandatory statute, or 
want to add support to 
a mandatory statute)

STEP THREE (CONTINUED): Find Primary Sources of Law Related to My Question/Issue 
(Primary sources of law are the law itself. Mandatory primary sources are the laws a court must follow.  
Persuasive primary sources are the laws a court may choose to follow, but doesn’t have to follow.) 

Mandatory Case Law (North Dakota Supreme Court case law is binding on North Dakota state courts 
deciding cases with similar facts and issues.) 

List the Court(s) that are mandatory for your legal issue. (Review Table T1 of “The Bluebook: A 
Uniform System of Citation.”)

Persuasive Case Law (Case law from courts of other states isn’t binding on North Dakota state courts, 
including the North Dakota Supreme Court. However, persuasive case law may be useful to add support 
to your legal argument. You may not need persuasive case law.) 

Do you need to use persuasive case law because little or no mandatory case law exists? Or, do you 
wish to add additional support using persuasive case law?

STEP FOUR: Are the Primary Sources of Law I’ve Identified Still Good Law? 
(You need to figure out if the laws on which you’re relying have been amended, limited, overruled, 
reversed, or invalidated. At the same time, you might discover other primary sources of law related to 
your legal issue. Step Four involves taking each primary source of law and tracking every time a court 
references the law, or the legislature takes action on the law. This process is commonly referred to as 
“Shepardizing.” Contact the Law Library for more information about Step Four.) 

Statutes, Rules & Regulations (Mandatory & Persuasive) 
(The print versions of the North Dakota Century Code & the North Dakota Court Rules Annotated include 
references to previous amendments and case law notes. The online North Dakota Administrative Code 
includes references to previous amendments, and statutory authority for the rule. Review print & online 
legal research resources for more suggestions.) 

Case Law (Mandatory & Persuasive) 
(You may find online legal research resources that provide a case law history search for either a paid 
subscription, or free of charge – review each subsequent case to determine how the court decided. 
Search the citation for the case using the Opinions search on the ND Supreme Court website – review 
each subsequent case to determine how the court decided. Review print & online legal research 
resources for more suggestions.) 

 

 

Review statutes for 
legislative action, & 
case law. 

Review procedural 
rules for amendments, 
& case law. 

Review administrative 
rules and regulation for 
agency or legislative 
action, & case law. 

Review for case law & 
legislative action 
amending, overruling, 
reversing, or 
invalidating.

STEP FIVE: Am I Finished Researching? 

It can be challenging to figure out if you’re finished with your legal research. 

•  Did you follow Steps One through Four? 
•  Did you answer your question(s) from Step One; or did you determine there isn’t an on-point 

answer to your question(s)? 

It may be time to stop researching when: 

•  You keep reading the same, or similar, legal rule. 
•  You keep being referred back to the same statutes or the same cases. 

STEP SIX: How Do the Primary Sources of Law Apply to My Circumstances. 

After you complete Steps One through Five, you analyze, or interpret, what the primary sources of law 
you’ve identified mean as they apply to your situation or circumstances. 

Step Six is an essential part of legal representation. This is how you determine your legal rights and 
responsibilities, build your legal argument to support your side of the case, and build your legal 
argument to challenge the other party’s side of a case. 

Tips for analyzing how your primary sources of law apply to your circumstances: 

•  Type or write your analysis. If you decide to bring your issue to a court, you’ll have your written 

or typed analysis as a reference when you prepare your legal documents. 

•  Start your analysis by listing your legal issue or question. 

o 

o 

It may be the same as you listed in Step One, or may have changed based on your legal 
research. 
If you have more than one issue, you may wish to analyze each issue separately. 

• 

List the relevant facts related to your legal issue or question. 

o  They may be the same facts you listed in Step One, or may be changed based on your 

research. 

•  Analyze or discuss how and why each primary source of law you’ve identified relates to your 

legal issue or question. This is the heart of Step Six. 

o  Compare how the facts of a case on which you rely are similar or different (or both) to 

your relevant facts. 

o  Discuss why each primary source of law applies or doesn’t apply to your circumstances. 

•  Type or write a brief summary of your analysis. 

Review print & online legal research resources for more information. You may find resources that 
include explanations about writing legal memoranda (memos) or writing legal briefs of interest.

STEP SEVEN: What is the Appropriate Process to Get my Issue to Court 
(If you decide to take your legal issue to a court, research the procedural law of the court to determine 
the appropriate process. 

Usually, starting a new civil action in a North Dakota state district court requires the Plaintiff to arrange 
for service of a summons and a copy of a complaint on each Defendant. Usually, when making a request 
to a North Dakota state district court in an existing civil action, the request is made in writing in the form 
of a motion.) 

Review the Informational & Research Guides at the ND Legal Self Help Center website. (Does the 
Center have a guide available?) 

earch for keywords in the printed General Index of the North Dakota Century Code. (To determine 
if a court rule is listed under a topic in the General Index, see the Table of Abbreviations on Page vii at 
the beginning of the printed General Index. The abbreviations for all of the North Dakota court rules 
are at the top of the list.)   

earch the Index at the beginning of each set of North Dakota court rules. (Indexes are available for 
each set of North Dakota court rules in both the printed North Dakota Rules Annotated and the North 
Dakota Court System website.) 

eview the mandatory statutes you identified for your legal issue to determine if the statute 

changes any process requirement from the North Dakota court rules. (Statutes may change or add 
additional requirements to a process.)
