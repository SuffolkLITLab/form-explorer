      <pre>Instructions for a Name Change – Minor Child (Under 18 Years Old) 

Important!  Read Before Using These Forms and Instructions 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out forms. If you’re 
unsure if these forms and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

If you need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota. Go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer for information about 
finding a lawyer to represent you. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules are available at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help.  

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities 
as a lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
procedure for petitioning a North Dakota District Court for the name change of a minor child 
(less than 18 years old). If the forms don’t fit your circumstances, consult a lawyer. There’s no 
guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self 
Help Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the 
forms or information provided. 

Use these forms and instructions at your own risk. 

A minor child is less than 18 years old.  If a child is 18 years or older, the child is an adult and 
must petition for a name change on their own. 

equirements for name changes are in North Dakota Century Code Chapter 32-28. 

  R

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules.

Note:  You (Petitioner) and the minor child must be residents of the county in North Dakota 

where the Petition will be filed for at least six months preceding the filing of the Petition. 

Also Note:  The minor child must be either a citizen or a permanent resident alien of the United 

States. 

You May Ask the Judge Assigned to your Case to Waive the 
Publication Requirement 

Caution: N.D.C.C. § 32-28-02 could be interpreted to mean that publication for the change of a 
minor’s name can’t be waived. N.D.C.C. § 32-28-02 could also be interpreted to require service 
of the Notice of Petition for Name Change even if waiver of publication is granted. North 
Dakota Legal Self Help Center staff can’t interpret the statute for you and tell you what the 
statute means for your circumstances. Interpretation of a statute requires legal advice. Center 
staff can’t give you legal advice under any circumstances. If you want the statute interpreted 
for you, consult a lawyer.  

North Dakota law requires that you publish notice of the minor child’s name change in the 
newspaper before the judge assigned to your case can consider granting the name change. (See 
N.D.C.C. § 32-28-02(4).) An affidavit of publication is from the newspaper is your proof you 
published the notice. 

• 

If the minor child has a non-custodial parent who lives in a different county than the 
child, publication is also required in a newspaper in the non-custodial parent’s county. 
•  A non-custodial parent is a parent with less than 50% of the residential responsibility. 

However, before you publish notice of the minor child’s name change, you may ask the judge 
assigned to your case to waive the publication requirement if:   

1.  You’re only asking for a change to the minor child’s first or middle name; or 
2.  You’re a victim of domestic violence as defined by North Dakota Century Code Section 

14-07.1-01, which states: 

“Domestic violence includes physical harm, bodily injury, sexual activity compelled 
by physical force, assault, or the infliction of fear of imminent physical harm, bodily 
injury, sexual activity compelled by physical force, or assault, not committed in self-
defense, on the complaining family or household members.” 

North Dakota law only allows a judge to consider the two reasons listed above for waiving 
the publication requirement.

If the judge doesn’t grant your request to waive publication in the newspaper(s), you’ll need 
to publish notice in the newspaper(s) and file the affidavit(s) of publication with the court. The 
newspaper will give you an affidavit of publication after publication of the notice is complete. 

This packet of forms and instructions includes the option of asking the judge assigned to your 
case to waive publication.

Written Objections with the Clerk of District Court 

Contact information for clerks of district court is available at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

Two options for filing are provided.  Follow A or B according to the steps you took above: 

  A.  If you published notice in the newspaper (completed Step 1), file the following: 

•  Petition For Name Change; 
•  Affidavit of Petitioner; 
•  Confidential Information Form; 
•  Notice of Petition for a Name Change; 
•  Affidavit of Publication (provided to you by the newspaper(s));

STEP 4: Get the Minor Child’s Criminal Background Check 

Stop!  ONLY do this step IF the Court requires the minor child to get a background check!! 

After you file the documents listed in Step 3, you’ll be notified by the court if a criminal history 
background check is required for the minor child. You’re required to pay all costs associated 
with the criminal history record check. 

If the court requires the minor child to complete a criminal history background check, you may 
be directed to the following website to get the minor child’s criminal history background check: 
fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. 

STEP 5: The Judge Decides Whether to Grant the Name Change 

**If the judge requires a hearing: 

•  A hearing isn’t required for petitions for name changes. However, the court may decide a 
hearing is necessary. The Clerk of District Court will notify you with the date, time, and 
location of the hearing, if the court decides a hearing is necessary. 

• 

If you’re required to attend a hearing, be prepared to prove everything you included in the 
petition and affidavit forms. 

**If the minor child has a criminal history: 

•  N.D.C.C. § 32-28-02(5) states “if the court issues a name change order for a petitioner who 
has criminal history in this or any other state, the court, within ten days after the issuance 
of the change of name order, shall report the name change to the bureau of criminal 
investigation.” 

The minor child’s name isn’t changed until the judge signs an order granting the name change. 

STEP 6: Request a Copy of the Order Granting Name Change and the 
Confidential Information Form 

If the judge grants the minor child’s name change, you’ll receive or will be mailed a copy of the 
signed and dated Order Granting Name Change. 

NDLSHC 

Page 15 of 16 

Min NC Inst/Rev Jan 2023 

HOWEVER, a certified copy (or copies) of the Order Granting Name Change may be necessary 
to change the minor child’s name with agencies, businesses, entities, etc. 

Important!  You’ll also need to request a certified copy (or copies) of the Confidential 

Information Form which MUST be attached to the Order Granting Name Change.   

• 

If the Confidential Information Forms isn’t attached, North Dakota Vital Records won’t 
accept the Order Granting Name Change. 

If a hearing was held, you can request the certified copies from the Clerk of District Court’s 
Office before you leave the courthouse. If the Order has been completed, you may be able to 
receive the copy that day.   

If a hearing wasn’t held, you can request certified copies from the Clerk of District Court’s 
Office.  Contact information is available at ndcourts.gov/court-locations. 

Cost of certified copies: 

•  $10 for the first certified copy; 
•  $5 for each additional certified copy (if requested at the same time).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
