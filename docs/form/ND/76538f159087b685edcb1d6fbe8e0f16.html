and   reduced   by   deductions   allowed   in   arriving   at   adjusted   gross   income   under   the 
Internal Revenue Code, and applying:

(1) The standard deduction for the tax filing status of single; and

(2) Tax tables for a single individual for the most recent year published by the internal

"Parent   with   primary   residential   responsibility"   means   a   parent   who   acts   as   the   primary 
caregiver on a regular basis for a proportion of time greater than the obligor, regardless of 
descriptions such as "shared" or "joint" parental rights and responsibilities given in relevant 
judgments, decrees, or orders.

"Self-employment"   means   employment   that   results  in   an   obligor   earning   income   from   any 
business organization or entity which the obligor is, to a significant extent, able to directly or 
indirectly control.  For  purposes  of  this  chapter,  it   also includes  any activity  that  generates 
income from rental property, royalties, business gains, partnerships, trusts, corporations, and

History:  Effective February 1,  1991; amended effective January 1, 1995;  August 1, 1999;  August 1, 
2003; October 1, 2008; April 1, 2010; July 1, 2011; September 1, 2015; January 1, 2019.
General Authority: NDCC 50-06-16, 50-09-25
Law Implemented: NDCC 14-09-09.7, 50-09-02(16); 42 USC 667

75-02-04.1-02. Determination of support amount - General instructions.

Except   as   provided   in   section   75-02-04.1-08.2,   calculations   of   child   support   obligations 
provided   for   under   this   chapter   consider   and   assume   that   one   parent   acts   as   a   primary 
caregiver   and  the  other   parent   contributes  a   payment   of   child   support   to  the  child's   care. 
Calculation of a child support obligation under section 75-02-04.1-08.2 does not preclude a 
court from apportioning specific expenses related to the care of the child, such as child care 
expenses   and   school   activity   fees,   between   the   parents.   An   apportionment   under   this 
subsection is in addition to the child support amount determined by application of this chapter.

2. Calculations assume that the care given to the child during temporary periods when the child 
resides   with   the   obligor   or   the   obligor's   relatives   do   not   substitute   for   the   child   support 
obligation.

3. Net income received by an obligor from all sources must be considered in the determination of 

available money for child support. 

The result of all calculations which determine a monetary amount ending in fifty cents or more 
must be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar, and must otherwise be rounded down to the 
nearest whole dollar.

In applying the child support guidelines, an obligor's monthly net income amount ending in fifty 
dollars or more must be rounded up to the nearest one hundred dollars, and must otherwise 
be rounded down to the nearest one hundred dollars.

The annual total of all income considered in determining a child support obligation must be 
determined and then divided by twelve in order to determine the obligor's monthly net income.

Income   must   be   sufficiently   documented   through   the   use   of   tax   returns,   current   wage 
statements, and other information to fully apprise the court of all gross income. Where gross 
income   is   subject   to   fluctuation,   regardless   of   whether   the   obligor   is   employed   or 
self-employed, information reflecting and covering a period of time sufficient to reveal the likely 
extent of fluctuations must be provided.

8. Calculations made under this chapter are ordinarily based upon recent past circumstances 
because   past   circumstances   are   typically   a   reliable   indicator   of   future   circumstances, 
particularly circumstances concerning income. If circumstances that materially affect the child 
support obligation have changed in the recent past or are very likely to change in the near 
future, consideration may be given to the new or likely future circumstances.

Each child support order must include a statement of the net income of the obligor used to 
determine the child support obligation, and how that net income was determined. If a child 
support   order   includes   an   adjustment   for   extended   parenting   time   under   section 
75-02-04.1-08.1, the order must specify the number of parenting time overnights. 

A payment of children's benefits made to or on behalf of a child who is not living with the 
obligor  must be credited as a payment toward the obligor's child support obligation in the 
month   (or   other   period)   the   payment   is   intended   to   cover,   but   may   not   be   credited   as   a 

1.

5.

6.

10.

4

payment toward the child support obligation for any other month or period. The court may 
order the obligee to reimburse the obligor for any overpayment that results from the credit 
provided in this subsection.

11. No amount may be deducted to determine net income unless that amount is included in gross 

income.

75-02-04.1-03.   Determination   of   child   support   obligation  -  Split   custody   or   primary 

residential responsibility.

A child support obligation must be determined and specifically ordered for the child or children for 
whom each parent has primary residential responsibility pursuant to a court order or, if there is no court 
order, for whom each parent has primary physical custody. The lesser obligation is then subtracted from 
the greater. The difference is the child support amount owed by the parent with the greater obligation. 
The   offset   of   child   support   obligations   in   this   section   is   for   payment   purposes   only   and   must   be 
discontinued   for   any   month   in   which   the   rights   to   support   of   a   child   for   whom   the   obligation   was 
determined are assigned to a government agency as a condition of receiving public assistance.

Repealed effective January 1, 2018.

75-02-04.1-05. Determination of net income from self-employment.

1. Net income from self-employment means total income, for internal revenue service purposes, 

of the obligor:

a. Reduced by that amount, if any, of:

(1) That total income that is not the obligor's income or that is otherwise included in 

gross income; and

(2) With respect to a partnership or a small business corporation for which an election 
under 26 U.S.C. section 1362(a) is in effect and over which the obligor is not able to 
exercise   direct   or   indirect   control   to   a   significant   extent,   that   income   of   the 
partnership or small business corporation which is not available, and has not yet 
been distributed, to the obligor; and

b.

Increased by that amount, if any, for:

(1) Business   expenses   attributable   to   the   obligor   or   a   member   of   the   obligor's 
household   for   employee's   or   proprietor's   benefits,   pensions,   and   profit-sharing 
plans;

(2) Payments   made   from   the   obligor's   self-employment   activity  to   a   member   of   the 
obligor's household, other than the obligor, to the extent the payment exceeds the 
fair market value of the service furnished by the household member; and

5

(3) With respect to a corporation that pays its own tax over which the obligor is able to 
exercise direct or indirect control to a significant extent, the taxable income of the 
corporation, less the corporation's federal income tax, multiplied by seventy percent 
of the obligor's ownership interest in the corporation. 

2.

3.

4.

"Member of the obligor's household" includes any individual who shares the obligor's home a 
substantial part of the time, without regard to whether that individual maintains another home.

If   the   tax   returns   are   not   available   or   do   not   reasonably   reflect   the   income   from 
self-employment, profit and loss statements which more accurately reflect the current status 
must be used.

Self-employment activities may experience significant changes in production and income over 
time. To the extent that information is reasonably available, the average of the most recent five 
years of each self-employment activity, if undertaken on a substantially similar scale, must be 
used   to   determine   self-employment   income.   When   self-employment   activity   has   not   been 
operated on a substantially similar scale for five years, a shorter period may be used.

5. When   averaging   self-employment   income   pursuant   to   subsection 4,   no   amount   may   be 
included in income for one year that was previously included in income for any other year 
during the period being averaged.

6. When  less   than   three   years   were   averaged   under   subsection 4,   a  loss   resulting   from   the 
averaging may be used to reduce other income that is not related to the self-employment 
activity that produced the loss only if the loss is not related to a hobby activity and monthly 
gross income, reduced by one-twelfth of the average annual self-employment loss, equals or 
exceeds the greatest of:

a.

b.

c.

a.

b.

c.

A monthly amount equal to one hundred sixty-seven times the hourly federal minimum 
wage;

An amount equal to six-tenths of this state's statewide average earnings for persons with 
similar work history and occupational qualifications; or

An   amount   equal   to   eighty   percent   of   the   obligor's   greatest   average   gross   monthly 
earnings,   calculated   without   using   self-employment   losses,   in   any  twelve   consecutive 
months included in the current calendar year and the two previous calendar years before 
commencement of the proceeding before the court.

7. When   three   or   more   years   were   averaged   under   subsection 4,   a   loss   resulting   from   the 
averaging may be used to reduce other income that is not related to the self-employment 
activity that produced the loss only if the loss is not related to a hobby activity, losses were 
calculated for no more than forty percent of the years averaged, and monthly gross income, 
reduced by one-twelfth of the average annual self-employment loss, equals or exceeds the 
greatest of:

A monthly amount equal to one hundred sixty-seven times the hourly federal minimum 
wage;

An amount equal to six-tenths of this state's statewide average earnings for persons with 
similar work history and occupational qualifications; or

An   amount   equal   to   ninety   percent   of   the   obligor's   greatest   average   gross   monthly 
earnings,   calculated   without   using   self-employment   losses,   in   any  twelve   consecutive 
months included in the current calendar year and the two previous calendar years before 
commencement of the proceeding before the court.

6

8.

For purposes of subsections 6 and 7, an activity is presumed to be a hobby activity if the 
result from averaging is a loss. The presumption may be rebutted if the obligor shows that the 
activity is not done primarily for enjoyment purposes, is a vocation and not an avocation and, 
in   the   context   of   the   child   support   obligation,   there   is   a   reasonable   expectation   that   the 
children will receive long-term benefits.

9. Net   income   from   self-employment   is   an   example   of   gross   income   and   is   subject   to   the 
deductions from gross income set forth in subsection 6 of section 75-02-04.1-01, to the extent 
not already deducted when calculating net income from self-employment.

The cost of supporting a child living with the obligor, who is not also a child of the obligee, may be 
deducted   from   net   income   under   subsection 4   of   section   75-02-04.1-06.1   and   is   determined   by 
applying the obligor's net income and the total number of children living with the obligor, who are not 
also children of the obligee, to whom the obligor owes a duty of support, to section 75-02-04.1-10.

History:  Effective   February 1,   1991;   amended   effective   January 1,   1995;  August 1, 1999;  August 1, 
2003.

75-02-04.1-06.1. Determination of support amount in multiple-family cases.

1.

This section must be used to determine the child support amount presumed to be the correct 
amount of child support in all cases involving an obligor who:

a. Owes duties of support payable to two or more obligees; or

b. Owes a duty of support to at least one obligee and also owes a duty of support to a child 

living with the obligor who is not also the child of that obligee.

If a court consolidates proceedings involving an obligor and two or more obligees, the court 
must determine all obligations that may be determined in the consolidated proceeding without 
regard to whom the initial moving party may be.

A hypothetical amount that reflects the cost of supporting children living with the obligor, as 
determined   under   section   75-02-04.1-06,   and   a   hypothetical   amount   due   to   each   obligee 
under this chapter must first be determined for the children living with the obligor and each 
obligee, whether or not the obligee is a party to the proceeding, assuming for purposes of that 
determination:

The obligor has no support obligations except to the obligee in question;

The guidelines amount is not rebutted; and

The obligor does not have extended parenting time.

2.

3.

a.

b.

c.

4.

A hypothetical amount due to each obligee under this chapter must next be determined for 
each obligee who is a party to the proceeding, assuming for purposes of that determination:

a.

The obligor's net income is reduced by:

7

(1) The   amount   of   child   support   due   to   all   other   obligees,   as   determined   under 

subsection 3; and

(2) The cost of supporting a child living with the obligor, who is not also the child of that 

obligee, as determined under section 75-02-04.1-06;

The guidelines amount is not rebutted;

Any support amount otherwise determined to be less than one dollar is determined to be 
one dollar; and

The obligor does not have extended parenting time.

5.

Except   as   provided   in   subdivision b,   for   each   obligee   before   the   court,   the   support 
obligation presumed to be the correct amount of child support is equal to one-half of the 
total of the two amounts determined, with respect to that obligee, under subsections 3 
and 4.

Any necessary determination under this section must be made before an adjustment for 
extended   parenting   time   appropriate   under   section   75-02-04.1-08.1.   The   "amount 
otherwise due under this chapter", for purposes of section 75-02-04.1-08.1, is equal to 
one-half of the total of the two amounts determined, with respect to that obligation, under 
subsections 3 and 4.

6.

The fact, if it is a fact, that the obligor is required to pay, or pays, a different amount than the 
hypothetical amounts determined under subsections 3 and 4 is not a basis for deviation from 
the procedure described in this section. 

7. When   determining   a   support   amount   under   paragraph 1   of   subdivision a   of   subsection 4, 
consider only children to whom an obligor owes a current monthly support obligation pursuant 
to a support order and other children under the age of eighteen to whom an obligor owes a 
duty of support.

75-02-04.1-07. Imputing income based on earning capacity.

1.

For purposes of this section:

"Earnings" includes in-kind income and amounts received in lieu of actual earnings, such 
as   social   security   benefits,   workers'   compensation   wage   replacement   benefits, 
unemployment insurance benefits, veterans' benefits, and earned income tax credits; and

An obligor is "underemployed" if the obligor's gross income from earnings is significantly 
less than this state's statewide average earnings for persons with similar work history 
and occupational qualifications. 

2.

An obligor is presumed to be underemployed if the obligor's gross income from earnings is 
less than the greater of:

Six-tenths of this state's statewide average earnings for persons with similar work history 
and occupational qualifications; or

A monthly amount equal to one hundred sixty-seven times the federal hourly minimum 
wage.

3.

Except as provided in subsections 4, 5, 6, and 7, gross income based on earning capacity 
equal to the greatest of subdivisions a through c, less actual gross earnings, must be imputed 
to an obligor who is unemployed or underemployed.

A monthly amount equal to one hundred sixty-seven times the hourly federal minimum 
wage. 

An amount equal to six-tenths of this state's statewide average earnings for persons with 
similar work history and occupational qualifications. 

An   amount   equal   to   ninety   percent   of   the   obligor's   greatest   average   gross   monthly 
earnings, in any twelve consecutive months included in the current calendar year and the 
two previous calendar years before commencement of the proceeding before the court, 
for which reliable evidence is provided. 

4. Monthly gross income based on earning capacity may not be imputed under subsection 3 if:

a.

The   reasonable   cost   of   child   care   equals   or   exceeds   seventy  percent   of   the   income 
which would otherwise be imputed where the care is for the obligor's child:

(1) For whom the obligor has primary residential responsibility; 

(2) Who is under the age of thirteen; and 

(3) For whom there is no other adult caretaker in the obligor's home available to meet 

the child's needs during absence due to employment.

b. Current medical records confirm the obligor suffers from a disability sufficient in severity 
to   reasonably   preclude   the   obligor   from   gainful   employment   that   produces   average 
monthly   gross   earnings   equal   to   at   least   one   hundred   sixty-seven   times   the   hourly 
federal minimum wage.

The   unusual   emotional   or   physical   needs   of   a   minor   child   of   the   obligor   require   the 
obligor's presence in the home for a proportion of the time so great as to preclude the 
obligor from gainful employment that produces average monthly gross earnings equal to 
one hundred sixty-seven times the hourly federal minimum wage. 

The obligor has average monthly gross earnings equal to or greater than one hundred 
sixty-seven times the hourly federal minimum wage and is not underemployed.

The obligor is under eighteen years of age or is under nineteen years of age and enrolled 
in and attending high school.

a.

b.

c.

e.

f.

The obligor is receiving:

(1) Supplemental security income payments;

(2) Social security disability payments;

(3) Workers' compensation wage replacement benefits;

(4) Total and permanent disability benefits paid by the railroad retirement board;

(5) Pension   benefits,   as   defined   in   subsection   9,   paid   by   the   veterans   benefits 

administration; or

(6) Disability compensation paid by the veterans benefits administration based on an 

overall disability rating of one hundred percent.

c.

It   has   been   less   than  one   hundred   eighty  days   since   the   obligor   was   released   from 
incarceration under a sentence of at least one hundred eighty days.

The   obligor   is   incarcerated   under   a   sentence   of   one   hundred   eighty  days   or   longer, 
excluding credit for time served before sentencing.

If   an   unemployed   or   underemployed   obligor   shows   that   employment   opportunities,   which 
would   provide   earnings   at   least   equal   to   the   lesser   of   the   amounts   determined   under 
subdivision b   or   c   of   subsection 3,   are   unavailable   within   one   hundred   miles   [160.93 
kilometers]   of   the   obligor's   actual   place   of   residence,   income   must   be   imputed   based   on 
earning capacity equal to the amount determined under subdivision a of subsection 3, less 
actual gross earnings. 

If the obligor fails, upon reasonable request made in any proceeding to establish or review a 
child support obligation, to furnish reliable information concerning the obligor's gross income 
from earnings, and if that information cannot be reasonably obtained from sources other than 
the obligor, income must be imputed based on the greatest of:

A monthly amount equal to one hundred sixty-seven times the hourly federal minimum 
wage.

An amount equal to one hundred percent of this state's statewide average earnings for 
persons with similar work history and occupational qualifications.

An amount equal to one hundred percent of the obligor's greatest average gross monthly 
earnings, in any twelve consecutive months included in the current calendar year and the 
two previous calendar years before commencement of the proceeding before the court, 
for which reliable evidence is provided.

7. Notwithstanding   subsections 4,   5,   and   6,   if   an   obligor   makes   a   voluntary   change   in 
employment resulting in reduction of income, monthly gross income equal to one hundred 
percent of the obligor's greatest average monthly earnings, in any twelve consecutive months 
included   in   the   current   calendar   year   and   the   two   previous   calendar   years   before 
commencement of the proceeding before the court, for which reliable evidence is provided, 
less actual  monthly gross earnings, may be imputed without a showing that the obligor is 
unemployed   or   underemployed.   For   purposes   of   this   subsection,   a   voluntary   change   in 
employment   is   a   change   made   for   the   purpose   of   reducing   the   obligor's   child   support 
obligation   and   may   include   becoming   unemployed,   taking   into   consideration   the   obligor's 
standard of living, work history, education, literacy, health, age, criminal record, barriers to 
employment, record of seeking employment, stated reason for change in employment, likely 
employment status if the family before the court were intact, and any other relevant factors. 
The burden of proof is on the obligor to show that the change in employment was not made 
for the purpose of reducing the obligor's child support obligation.

Imputed income based on earning capacity is an example of gross income and is subject to 
the deductions from gross income set forth in subsection 6 of section 75-02-04.1-01.

For purposes of paragraph 5 of subdivision f of subsection 4, "pension benefits" means only 
needs-based payments made by the veterans benefits administration to war-time veterans 
whose income is below a yearly limit set by Congress and who are age sixty-five or older or 
have a total and permanent disability.

The income and financial circumstances of the spouse of an obligor may not be considered as 
income for child support purposes unless the spouse's income and financial circumstances are, to a 
significant extent, subject to control by the obligor as where the obligor is a principal in a business 
employing the spouse.

75-02-04.1-08.1. Adjustment for extended parenting time.

1.

For purposes of this section, "extended parenting time" means parenting time between an 
obligor and a child living with an obligee scheduled by court order to exceed an annual total of 
one hundred overnights. 

2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and as limited by subsection 3, if a court 
order   provides   for   extended   parenting   time   between   an   obligor   and   a   child   living   with   an 
obligee, the support obligation presumed to be the correct child support amount due on behalf 
of all children of the obligor living with the obligee must be determined under this subsection.

a. Determine   the   amount   otherwise   due   under   this   chapter   from   the   obligor   for   those 

children.

b. Divide the amount determined under subdivision a by the number of those children. 

c.

For each child, multiply the number of that child's parenting time overnights times .32 and 
subtract the resulting amount from three hundred sixty-five.

d. Divide the result determined under subdivision c by three hundred sixty-five.

e. Multiply   the   amount   determined   under   subdivision b   times   each   decimal   fraction 

determined under subdivision d.

f.

Total all amounts determined under subdivision e.

3.

An adjustment for extended parenting time is not authorized if the parents of a child for whom 
support   is   being   determined   have   equal   residential   responsibility   according   to   section 
75-02-04.1-08.2.

75-02-04.1-08.2. Equal residential responsibility - Determination of child support obligation.

A child support obligation must be determined as described in this section in all cases in which a 
court   orders   each   parent   to   have   equal   residential   responsibility   for   their   child   or   children.   Equal 
residential responsibility means each parent has residential responsibility for the child or children for an 
equal amount of time as determined by the court. If equal residential responsibility is ordered for all the 
children,   a   child   support   obligation   for   each   parent   must   be   calculated   under   this   chapter,   and 
specifically ordered, assuming the other parent has primary residential responsibility for the child or 
children subject  to the equal residential  responsibility order.  If  equal residential responsibility is not 
ordered for all the children, a child support obligation must be calculated and specifically ordered for 
each parent for the children for whom the other parent has primary residential responsibility plus the 

11

children   for   whom   the   parents   have   equal   residential   responsibility.   The   lesser   obligation   is   then 
subtracted from the greater. The difference is the child support amount owed by the parent with the 
greater obligation. Each parent is an obligee to the extent of the other parent's calculated obligation. 
Each parent is an obligor to the extent of that parent's calculated obligation. The offset of child support 
obligations in this section is for payment purposes only and must be discontinued for any month in 
which   the   rights   to   support   of   a   child   for   whom   the   obligation   was   determined   are   assigned   to   a 
government agency as a condition of receiving public assistance.

75-02-04.1-09. Criteria for rebuttal of guideline amount.

1.

The   child   support   amount   provided   for   under   this   chapter,   except   for   subsection 2,   is 
presumed to be the correct amount of child support. No rebuttal of the guidelines may be 
based upon evidence of factors described or applied in this chapter, except in subsection 2, or 
upon:

Except   as   provided   in   subdivision   m   of   subsection   2,   the   subsistence   needs,   work 
expenses, and daily living expenses of the obligor; or

Except as provided for in subdivision n of subsection 2, the income of the obligee, which 
is reflected in a substantial monetary and nonmonetary contribution to the child's basic 
care and needs by virtue of being a parent with primary residential responsibility. 

2.

The presumption that the amount of child support that would result from the application of this 
chapter, except for this subsection, is the correct amount of child support is rebutted only if a 
preponderance of the evidence establishes that a deviation from the guidelines is in the best 
interest of the supported children and:

The increased need if support for more than six children is sought in the matter before 
the court;

The increased ability of an obligor, with a monthly net income which exceeds twenty-five 
thousand dollars, to provide additional child support based on demonstrated needs of the 
child, including, if applicable, needs arising from activities in which a child participated 
while the child's family was intact; 

The   increased   need   if   educational   costs   have   been   voluntarily   incurred,   at   private 
schools, with the prior written concurrence of the obligor;

The increased needs of children with disabling conditions or chronic illness;

The increased needs of children age twelve and older; 

The   increased   needs   of   children   related   to   the   cost   of   child   care,   purchased   by  the 
obligee,   for   reasonable   purposes   related   to   employment,   job   search,   education,   or 
training;

The increased ability of an obligor, whose net income has been substantially reduced as 
a   result   of   depreciation   and   to   whom   income   has   been   imputed   under   section 
75-02-04.1-07, to provide child support;

The increased ability of an obligor, who is able to secure additional income from assets, 
to provide child support;

purpose   of   reducing   the   obligor's   income   available   for   payment   of   child   support,   to 
provide child support;

The reduced ability of an obligor who is responsible for all parenting-time expenses to 
provide support due to travel expenses incurred predominantly for the purpose of visiting 
a   child   who   is   the   subject   of   the   order   taking   into   consideration   the   amount   of 
court-ordered parenting time and, when such history is available, actual expenses and 
practices of the parties;

The reduced ability of the obligor to pay child support due to a situation, over which the 
obligor has little or no control, which requires the obligor to incur a continued or fixed 
expense for other than subsistence needs, work expenses, or daily living expenses, and 
which is not otherwise described in this subsection;

l.

The reduced  ability of  the  obligor  to provide  support  due  to the obligor's  health care 
needs, to the extent that the costs of meeting those health care needs:

(1) Exceed ten percent of the obligor's gross income; 

(2) Have been incurred and are reasonably certain to continue to be incurred by the 

obligor;

income; and

(3) Are not subject to payment or reimbursement from any source except the obligor's 

(4) Are necessary to prevent or delay the death of the obligor or to avoid a significant 

loss of income to the obligor.

The reduced ability of the obligor to provide support when the obligor is in the military, is 
on a temporary duty assignment, and must maintain two households as a result of the 
assignment;

The reduced needs of the child to support from the obligor in situations where the net 
income of the obligee is at least three times higher than the net income of the obligor; or

The improved convenience to the parents, and negligible impact to the child, of a nominal 
increase   in   the   child   support   obligation   of   the   parent   with   the   smaller   obligation   as 
determined under section 75-02-04.1-08.2, not to exceed seventy-five dollars per month, 
in order for the obligation of each parent to be equal prior to application of the payment 
offset provided in that section and eliminate any net amount being due except during 
months when the obligation is assigned to a government agency.

3.

Assets may not be considered under subdivisions h and i of subsection 2, to the extent they:

a.

Are exempt under North Dakota Century Code section 47-18-01;

b. Consist of necessary household goods and furnishings; or

c.

Include one motor vehicle in which the obligor owns an equity not in excess of twenty 
thousand dollars.

4.

For purposes of subdivision i of subsection 2, a transaction is presumed to have been made 
for the purpose of reducing the obligor's income available for the payment of child support if:

a.

The transaction occurred after the birth of a child entitled to support;

13

b.

c.

The transaction occurred no more than twenty-four months before the commencement of 
the proceeding that initially established the support order; and

The obligor's income is less than it likely would have been if the transaction had not 
taken place.

For purposes of subdivision k of subsection 2, a situation over which the obligor has little or no 
control does not exist if the situation arises out of spousal support payments, discretionary 
purchases, or illegal activity.

For purposes of subdivisions a through f and subdivision o of subsection 2, any adjustment 
shall be made to the child support amount resulting from application of this chapter. When 
section   75-02-04.1-03   or   75-02-04.1-08.2   applies,   the   adjustment   must   be   made   to   the 
parent's obligation before the lesser obligation is subtracted from the greater obligation.

For purposes of subdivisions g through m of subsection 2, any adjustment shall be made to 
the obligor's net income. 

For   purposes   of   subdivision n  of   subsection 2,   any  adjustment   shall   be   made   to   the  child 
support amount resulting from application of this chapter after taking into consideration the 
proportion by which the obligee's net income exceeds the obligor's net income. When section 
75-02-04.1-03   or   75-02-04.1-08.2   applies,   the   adjustment   must   be   made   to   the   parent's 
obligation before the lesser obligation is subtracted from the greater obligation.

History: Effective February 1, 1991; amended effective January 1, 1995; August 1, 2003; July 1, 2011; 
September 1, 2015; January 1, 2018; January 1, 2019.
General Authority: NDCC 50-06-16, 50-09-25
Law Implemented: NDCC 14-09-09.7, 50-09-02(16); 42 USC 667

75-02-04.1-11. Parental responsibility for children in foster care or guardianship care.

It is important that parents maintain a tie to and responsibility for their child when that child is in 
foster care. Financial responsibility for the support of that child is one component of the maintenance of 
the relationship of parent and child. Parents of a child subject to a guardianship order under North 
Dakota Century Code chapter 27-20 or 30.1-27 remain financially responsible for the support of that 
child.

1.

In order to determine monthly net income, it is first necessary to identify the parent or parents 
who have financial responsibility for any child entering foster care or guardianship care, and to 
determine the net income of those financially responsible parents. If the parents of a child in 
foster care or guardianship care reside together, and neither parent has a duty to support any 
child who is not also a child of the other parent, the income of the parents must be combined 
and treated as  the income of the obligor. In all other cases, each parent is treated as an 
obligor, and each parent's support obligation must be separately determined. 

2. Unless subsection 3 applies to the obligor, the net income and the total number of children are 
applied to section 75-02-04.1-10 to determine the child support amount. That child support 
amount   is   then   divided   by   the   total   number   of   children   to   determine   the   child   support 
obligation for each child in foster care or guardianship care. For purposes of this subsection, 
the "total number of children" means:

a.

b.

If a child entering foster care or guardianship care resides in the obligor's home, the total 
number of children residing in the obligor's home to whom the obligor owes a duty of 
support, including the child or children entering foster care or guardianship care, plus any 
other full siblings of the child or children entering foster care or guardianship care to 
whom the obligor owes a duty of support who are not residing in the obligor's home; or

If no child entering foster care or guardianship care resides in the obligor's home, the 
child or children entering foster care or guardianship care plus the full siblings of the child 
or children entering foster care or guardianship care to whom the obligor owes a duty of 
support.

3.

If an obligor owes a duty of support to any child other than the child or children described in 
subdivision a or b of subsection 2, as applicable to that obligor, the support obligation must be 
determined through application of section 75-02-04.1-06.1 such that:

21

a.

b.

The   total   number   of   children,   as   described   in   subdivision a   or   b   of   subsection 2,   as 
applicable to that obligor, are treated as one obligee; and

The  amount   resulting  from   the  application  of   section   75-02-04.1-06.1  for   the  children 
described in subdivision a or b of subsection 2, as applicable to that obligor, is divided by 
the total number of such children to determine the child support obligation for each child 
in foster care or guardianship care.

4.

For  purposes   of  subsection 2,  a full  sibling  of  the  child  or  children entering  foster  care  or 
guardianship care is a brother or sister who has both parents in common with the child or 
children entering foster care or guardianship care. 

History:  Effective February 1,  1991; amended effective January 1, 1995;  August 1, 1999;  August 1, 
2003; July 1, 2011.
General Authority: NDCC 50-06-16, 50-09-25
Law Implemented: NDCC 14-09-09.7, 50-09-02(16); 42 USC 667

75-02-04.1-12. Uncontested proceedings.

In a proceeding where the obligor appears, but does not resist the child support amount sought by 
the obligee, and in proceedings where the parties agree or stipulate to a child support amount, credible 
evidence  describing  the  obligor's  income  and  financial circumstances,  which  demonstrates  that  the 
uncontested or agreed amount of child support conforms to the requirements of this chapter, must be 
presented.

History: Effective February 1, 1991.
General Authority: NDCC 50-06-16, 50-09-25
Law Implemented: NDCC 14-09-09.7, 50-09-02(12); 42 USC 667

75-02-04.1-13. Application.

The child support guideline schedule amount is rebuttably presumed to be the correct amount of 
child   support   in   all   child   support   determinations,   including   both   temporary   and   permanent 
determinations,   and   including   determinations   necessitated   by  actions   for   the  support   of   children   of 
married persons, actions seeking domestic violence protection orders, actions arising out of divorce, 
actions arising out of paternity determinations, actions based upon a claim for necessaries, actions 
arising out of juvenile court proceedings, interstate actions for the support of children in which a court of 
this state has the authority to establish or modify a support order, and actions to modify orders for the 
support of children. The fact that two or more such actions may be consolidated for trial or otherwise 
joined for convenient consideration of facts does not prevent the application of this chapter to those 
actions.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
