      <pre>Instructions for Answering a Motion to Remove Visitation, 
Communication, or Interaction Restrictions with a Ward 

IMPORTANT!  READ BEFORE USING THESE FORMS AND INSTRUCTIONS 

ND Legal Self Help Center staff and Court employees can’t help you fill out the form(s).  Carefully 
read this information and any instructions to which you’re referred. 

If you’re unsure how to proceed, or need legal advice or legal representation, consult a lawyer 
licensed to practice in North Dakota. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; and 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the state laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. If you’re unsure if these forms 
and instructions suit your circumstances, consult a lawyer.  For more information about finding 
a lawyer, ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-lawyer. 

These instructions and forms aren’t a complete statement of the law. They cover the basic 
process for answering a motion to a North Dakota state district court to remove visitation, 
communication, or interaction restrictions put in place by the guardian(s) of a Ward. There’s no 
guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help 
Center. The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the forms or 
information provided. Use at your own risk. 

 

 DON’T DELAY!   

You have a limited amount of time to answer a written motion to remove visitation, 
communication, or interaction restrictions with a Ward! 

•  You have 14 days to answer if served by hand delivery or at your office. 
•  You have 17 days to answer if served by mail or third-party commercial carrier. 
(See Page 8 for more information about calculating these deadlines.)

OP Instructions: Aug 2021 

CAUTION!  Read BEFORE You Start! 

You, the Guardian, are allowed to restrict visitation, communication, and interaction with the 
Ward, as long as the restrictions are in the best interests of the Ward.  Certain people are 
allowed to make a motion to the Court to ask to remove the restrictions you put in place.  They 
must prove that removal is in the best interests of the Ward. 

There’s NO guarantee that using these forms and following these instructions will result in 
the Court keeping the restrictions in place.  These forms give you the basic process and 
formatting for answering this type of motion.  Ultimately, it’s up to you to prove to the judge or 
judicial referee in writing and at the hearing that your restrictions are in the best interests of 
the Ward and removing the restrictions wouldn’t be in the best interests of the Ward. 

If you believe the motion to remove restrictions is frivolous, you can ask the judge or judicial 
referee to force the person who made the motion to pay your attorney fees.  You’ll need to 
show the judge or judicial referee in writing and at the hearing how the motion is frivolous.  
The North Dakota Supreme Court has defined “frivolous” to mean there’s “such a complete 
absence of actual facts or law a reasonable person could not have expected a court would 
render a judgment in that person’s favor.” (Rath v. Rath, 2016 ND 46.) 

Who May Use this Packet of Forms? 

These forms may be used by the Guardian(s) appointed for an adult Ward by a North Dakota 
state district court who has been served a motion to remove visitation, communication, or 
interaction restrictions. 

These forms allow the Guardian(s) to answer the motion and explain why the restrictions were 
put in place and how the restrictions are in the best interests of the Ward. 

What if I Don’t Meet the Requirements to Use this Packet of Forms? 

Forms for common and uncomplicated matters that may come up throughout a guardianship of 
an adult are found at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-guardianship.  Forms aren’t available 
for every situation or circumstance. 

If you don’t find a form that suits your circumstances at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/adult-
guardianship, a form isn’t available.  You may wish to consult a lawyer to help you decide what 
to do next.

What Are the Steps to Answer a Motion to Remove Visitation, 
Communication, or Interaction Restrictions? 

Step One: 

The Guardian Calculates Their Deadline to Answer the Motion 
The Guardian has 14 or 17 days to answer the motion in writing. 
***If the Court grants an emergency hearing, the Guardian has less time. 

Step Two: 

The Guardian Completes the 2 Answer to Motion Forms in the Packet 

Step Three: 

The Guardian Arranges Service of Copies of the 2 Completed Forms on the 
Moving Party, Ward, Ward’s Spouse, and All Interested Persons 

Step Four: 

The Guardian Files the Original Completed Forms with the Clerk of Court 

Step Five: 

The Guardian Prepares Their Case 

Step Six: 

A Hearing is Held Before the District Court Makes a Decision Based on the 
Documents Filed and the Evidence Presented at the Hearing 

Step Seven: 

Findings of Fact and Order is Issued by the District Court: 
•  The District Court may keep the restrictions in place without change; 
•  The District Court may keep restrictions in place, but either increase or 

decrease the restrictions; OR 

•  The District Court may remove the restrictions completely. 

***If the Court Grants an Emergency Hearing, You Have Less than 14 
Days to Answer the Motion 

A hearing to present evidence is required before the judge or judicial referee can make a 
decision on whether it’s in the Ward’s best interests that restrictions should be removed. 

In general, these types of hearings are scheduled according to each District Court’s regular 
calendaring process.  Expect hearings to be scheduled a minimum of 3-6 months in the future.  
Depending on caseloads, your hearing may be scheduled more than 6 months in the future. 

IMPORTANT: If the Ward’s health is in significant decline, or if the Ward’s death may be 
imminent, the Moving Party may request an emergency hearing.  If the Court granted an 
emergency hearing, you, the Guardian(s), have less than 14 days to answer the motion. 

NDLSHC 

[Page 3 of 16] 

OP Instructions: Aug 2021 

The District Court isn’t required to grant this request and will only schedule an emergency 
hearing if the Moving Party included sufficient information in their affidavit in support of their 
motion showing the Ward’s health is in significant decline, or the Ward is close to death. 

 If the Court granted the emergency hearing, the emergency hearing must be held as soon as 
possible, but not later than 14 days after the Moving Party filed their motion. 

What Laws and Rules Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet? 

Section 30.1-28-12.2 of the North Dakota Century Code governs motions for removing 
restrictions on visitation, communication, and interaction with a Ward. 

Rule 3.2 of the North Dakota Rules of Court governs motions in North Dakota state district 
court cases. 

Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure governs service of motion documents filed 
in a District Court guardianship case. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and court decisions.  To 
determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota 
law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the 
North Dakota Century Code are found in many North Dakota public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation. 

What Definitions Do I Need to Know to Use this Packet of Forms? 

***The following definitions are intended to be helpful, BUT they’re NOT intended to 
constitute legal advice OR address every possible meaning of the terms in this section.*** 

Guardian (or Co-Guardians) – An individual or nonprofit corporation appointed by a North 
Dakota state district court to make personal decisions for the Ward. 

In-Camera Interview – Part of a hearing that’s held in private before a judge or judicial referee.  
The judge or judicial referee decides who will be allowed to be part of in the in-camera 
interview. 

NDLSHC 

[Page 4 of 16] 

OP Instructions: Aug 2021 

Interested Person – Includes heirs, devisees, children, spouses, creditors, beneficiaries, and any 
others having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a Ward.  
Interested persons are usually listed in the findings and order appointing the Guardian(s). 

Judicial Referee – A judicial officer, appointed by the presiding District Court judge, who has the 
authority to preside in Juvenile Court proceedings.  The findings and order of the judicial 
referee have the effect of the findings and order of a District Court judge until superseded by a 
written order of a District Court judge. 

Motion – A written request to a North Dakota state district court to issue an order for a specific 
purpose.  For example, a written request for an order removing visitation, communication, or 
interactions restrictions between the Restricted Party and the Ward. 

Moving Party – (See also Restricted Party and Ward) The Restricted Party or Ward making the 
motion. 

Opposing Party – (See also Guardian) The Guardian answering the motion in writing. 

Restricted Party – (See also Moving Party) The person on whom the Ward’s Guardian placed 
visitation, communication, or interaction restrictions. 

Ward – (See also Guardian) An adult individual for who a North Dakota state district court 
appointed a guardian. 

A Judicial Referee May Hear and Decide Your Motion 

Rule 13 of the North Dakota Supreme Court Administrative Rules allows adult guardianship 
cases in District Court to be heard and decided by a judicial referee, rather than a District Court 
judge. 

If a judicial referee is assigned to the guardianship case, any party to the case may request that 
a District Court judge hear and decide the case instead.  The party must file a written request 
with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of the notice of hearing. 

If the guardianship case is heard and decided by a judicial referee, the judicial referee will issue 
findings of fact and an order.  The judicial referee’s findings of fact and order have the same 
effect as the findings of fact and order of a District Court judge until superseded (replaced) by a 
written order of a District Court judge. 

 

NDLSHC 

[Page 5 of 16] 

OP Instructions: Aug 2021 

If any party to the guardianship case wants a review of the judicial referee’s findings of fact and 
order, the party must file a written request for a review, stating the specific reasons for the 
review, with the Clerk of Court within seven days after service of notice of the right to 
review. 

The party requesting the review must give notice of their request to all other parties.  Any party 
who wishes to respond to the request for review must file their written response within 
fourteen days after service of the notice of the request for review.

STEPS IN THE PROCESS 

You MUST complete ALL steps.  Don’t skip steps! 

STEP ONE: Calculate the Deadline to Answer the Motion 

You, the Opposing Party (Guardian), have 14 days to answer if you were served the motion by 
hand delivery or at your office. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion was hand delivered or left at your office. 

You, the Opposing Party (Guardian), have 17 days to answer if you were served the motion by 
mail or third party commercial carrier. 

•  The date of service is the date the motion was mailed. 
•  Keep the envelope with the postmarked date for reference. 

IMPORTANT: If an emergency hearing was granted, you have less than 14 days to answer the 
motion. 

•  Carefully review the date of the hearing listed in the Notice of Motion. 
• 

If you plan to serve your answer to motion documents by hand delivery, serve and file 
your documents at least 2 days before the hearing date. 
If you plan to serve your answer to motion documents by Mail, serve and file your 
documents at least 5 days before the hearing date. 

• 

When calculating days: 

•  Don’t include the day of the event that triggers the start of the period; 
•  Count by calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and 
• 

Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that isn’t a Saturday, 
Sunday, or legal holiday.  

If you, the Opposing Party (Guardian), don’t serve and file a written answer to the motion, the 
judge or judicial referee may consider this an admission by you that the motion to remove 
restrictions has merit.

More information about subpoenas is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/subpoenas. 

Evidence: You’re required to follow the North Dakota Rules of Evidence when presenting your 
own evidence and when objecting to the evidence presented by other parties. 

An Evidence Research Guide is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

You may also wish to review the guides for self-represented individuals for gathering and 
presenting evidence at rcdvcpc.org/resources/self-represented-litigants-series.html. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. Your local 
public or academic library may have resources available.

STEP SIX: A Hearing is Held Before the District Court Makes a Decision 

If the Hearing will be Held in Person, Attend the Hearing in Person: 

If you need to request to appear at the hearing some other way, a request form is available at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

Be prepared to prove everything you typed or wrote in your answer to motion documents. 

Organize the information, documents, etc. that you think you’ll need for the hearing.  At 
minimum, prepare an outline of your remarks and arguments. 

Review pre-trial and trial guidebooks for self-represented litigants and lawyers. See Step 5 for 
more information. 

Arrive Early to the Courthouse on the Date of the Hearing:  

If your hearing is in-person at the courthouse, arrive early so you don’t miss your hearing date 
and time.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t get to court on the date and time 
scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

If the Hearing will be Held by Zoom, Make Sure You Can Connect to the Zoom Hearing: 

If your hearing is held electronically by Zoom, well before the hearing begins, make sure you 
can connect and understand how to function in Zoom. 

NDLSHC 

[Page 14 of 16] 

OP Instructions: Aug 2021 

Don’t be late to the Zoom hearing.  If you have a serious, unavoidable reason you can’t attend 
the hearing on the date and time scheduled for trial, call the District Court as soon as you can. 

Conduct of the Hearing:  

The judge, or judicial referee, hears both sides and then issues the findings of fact and order.  
Sometimes, the findings of fact and order is issued at the end of the hearing.  Often, the 
findings of fact and order is issued at a later date. 

In general, a hearing proceeds in the following order:  

•  Opening Statements 

o  Each party gives an opening statement. Usually, the Moving Party (Restricted 

Party) goes first. 

•  Moving Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Moving Party presents their case first. The Opposing Party (Guardian) may 

cross-examine witnesses and object to the Moving Party’s evidence. 

•  Opposing Party Presents Witnesses and Evidence 

o  The Opposing Party presents their case after the Moving Party.  The Moving 

Party may cross-examine witnesses and object to the Opposing Party’s evidence. 

•  Closing Arguments 

Before You Leave the Courthouse:  

o  Each party gives a closing statement.  Usually the Opposing Party goes first. 

Make sure you understand what happens next.  Ask if you aren’t sure what, if anything, you 
need to do next. 

STEP SEVEN: Findings of Fact and Order 

Until the judge or judicial referee signs an order deciding what to do with the restrictions put in 
place by the Guardian(s), the restrictions remain in place. 

After the judge or judicial referee reviews all documents filed and following the evidentiary 
hearing, the judge or judicial referee will make a decision and issue findings of fact and an 
order. 

   

NDLSHC 

[Page 15 of 16] 

OP Instructions: Aug 2021 

Based on all documents filed and the evidence presented at the hearing, the judge or judicial 
referee may order any of the following: 

•  Keep the restrictions in place without change; 
•  Keep restrictions in place, but either increase or decrease the restrictions; OR 
•  Remove the restrictions completely. 

IF THE JUDGE OR JUDICIAL REFEREE DECIDES TO KEEP THE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE,  you may 

be required to file a proposed order for the judge or judicial referee to sign. 

You may use MP Form 5: Findings of Fact and Order to prepare your proposed findings and 
order. 

MP Form 5: Findings of Fact and Order on Motion to Remove Visitation, Communication, or 
Interaction Restrictions (Proposed) 

The Opposing Party (Guardian) completes this form. 

•  Top of Form (Caption) 

o  Fill out exactly as you filled out the Caption of OP Form 1: Answer Brief. 

•  To complete MP Form 5: Findings of Fact and Order (Proposed) 

o  Read the paragraphs carefully. 
o  Complete all paragraphs that require you to type or write information. 

•  DON’T SIGN OR DATE THIS FORM!  

o  This is your proposed order for the judge or judicial referee to sign if they agree with 

the all of the information you wrote or typed in your proposed order. 

o  The proposed order isn’t effective until it’s signed by the judge or judicial referee. 

You’ll receive a copy of the Findings of Fact and Order signed and dated by the judge or judicial 
referee by mail or email. 

Don’t include these instructions when you serve or file the completed forms.
