      <pre>READ BEFORE COMPLETING THE PROPOSED AMENDED JUDGMENT 
GENERAL-USE TEMPLATE (FAMILY LAW CASE) 

This General-Use template may be used to create your proposed Amended Judgment when 
making a motion to modify a judgment in a family law case.  The modifications must be 
based on a written stipulated agreement between all parties.  

To complete this form, you must recreate your judgment by doing three things: 

1)

2)

3)

Copy the ENTIRE contents of each unamended paragraph of the judgment or most
recently amended judgment you are asking the court to modify; and

When you come to the paragraphs you want to modify, copy and underline the
EXACT wording of the amended paragraph from your proposed order.

If you are asking the court to add new paragraphs, copy and underline the EXACT
wording of each NEW paragraph from your proposed order.

You have two options to recreate your judgment using this form: 

Option One: Use the fillable form as is.  This form includes 9 blank pages in which you may type 
the words and formatting of your proposed amended judgment, including paragraph numbers.  
If your proposed amended judgment is more than 9 pages in length, use Option Two. 

CAUTION: The ND Legal Self Help Center webpage DOES NOT automatically save what 
you’ve typed into a form.  Remember to save the form as you go, so you do not lose what 
you’ve typed. 

Option Two: Use a word processing program.  Use a word processing program, such as Microsoft 
Word, WordPerfect, Google Docs, or OpenOffice, to type the words and formatting of your 
proposed amended judgment, including paragraph numbers. 

Copy and paste the ENTIRE first page of the form, EXCEPT the italicized paragraphs in 
(parentheses), into the first page of your document.  Then, copy and paste all of the words on the 
second page of the form into your document.   

IMPORTANT: Make sure the formatting of the words you copied and pasted are the same 
as the formatting in the amended judgment general use template. 

Then, type the words and formatting of your proposed amended judgment, including paragraph 
numbers.  Include the Clerk of Court date and signature block at the end. 

Do not include this cover sheet when you serve or file the completed form.

There is no guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND 
Legal Self Help Center.  

Do not include this instruction sheet when you serve or file the completed form.  

A stipulated agreement is a document both parties sign stating they agree, or stipulate, there is 
no dispute concerning the specific matters involved. The stipulated agreement spells out the 
terms of the issue at hand, as well as stating the agreement of both parties. 

A proposed judgment is a written order of the judge’s decision and the remedies, if any, that 
are ordered. 

If you are making a motion to modify a North Dakota state district court family law case, you 
will probably be required to file a proposed Order to Amend and proposed Amended Judgment.  
This general-use form is to assist you in creating your own Amended Judgment.

a-motion.

recently amended judgment in your case, and your proposed order to amend.

amended judgment.

Amended Judgmt wStip F.L./Nov 2019 

•  Count the total number of pages. 

•  Fill in the total number of pages in the second blank space of the page number on each 

page. 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the second blank space of the page 

number will look like this: “Page ___ of 4.” 

•  Now fill in the first blank space of the page number on each page. 

o  Fill in “1” in the first blank space of the page number on the first page. 

o  Fill in “2” in the first blank space of the page number on the second page. 

o  And so on for each page of your proposed Amended Judgment. 

o  For example, if you have 4 total pages, the page number on each consecutive 

page will look like this: “Page 1 of 4,” “Page 2 of 4,” “Page 3 of 4,” “Page 4 of 4.” 

Service: 

In general, copies of documents filed, or intended to file, with the court must be provided to 
the other parties in the civil action.  This is called service.  This includes serving the proposed 
Amended Judgment. 

There are specific requirements for serving documents.  Rule 4 and Rule 5 of the North Dakota 
Rules of Civil Procedure give the requirements for service in a civil action. 

Proof of service is an important step in the legal process.  The court will not act on papers filed 
with the court until proof of service is filed. 

For information about service and proof of service in a civil action, go to the Service link on the 
ND Legal Self Help Center website.
