WHAT IS A CLAIM AGAINST AN ESTATE? 

When a deceased individual owes debts or obligations before death, and when the estate of 
the deceased individual owes debts or obligations after death, creditors make claims against 
the estate for payment. 

IS THERE A DEADLINE FOR CREDITORS TO MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST AN ESTATE? 

Yes, when an estate is probated in a North Dakota state district court, creditors have a specific 
period of time to make a formal claim for payment of the debt. 

If the debt or obligation occurred before death, the deadline to make a claim is: 

•  Three months after the date the notice was first published IF the personal 

representative chose to publish notice to creditors AND the notice of publication met 
the requirements of North Dakota Century Code Section 30.1-19-01. 

•  Three years after the date of death IF the personal representative chose NOT to publish 

notice to creditors. 

If the debt or obligation occurred after death, the deadline to make a claim is: 

•  Four months after performance of the contract by the personal representative, IF the 

claim is based on a contract with the personal representative. 

•  Three months after the claim arises, for any other claim. 

(In North Dakota state district court probate cases, a personal representative is appointed by 
the court to handle the estate.) 

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE FORMS TO MAKE A CLAIM 
AGAINST AN ESTATE? 

No, the ND Legal Self Help Center does not have a packet of forms for making a claim against 
an estate.  If you decide to represent yourself, you will need to create and prepare your own 
legal documents.   

However, an example of a form to make a claim against an estate probated in North Dakota 
District Court in included at the end of this Informational Guide.  It may be of interest as a 
formatting example.

in North Dakota.  Ask the lawyer about Limited Legal Representation.  Lawyers licensed to 
practice in North Dakota may agree to help you with part of your civil action, such as preparing 
legal documents, while you handle the rest of your civil action.  You and the lawyer must agree 
in writing to Limited Legal Representation. 

WHAT ARE NORTH DAKOTA LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO CLAIMS AGAINST 
ESTATES? 

Title 30.1 of the North Dakota Century Code www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t30-1.html contains 
laws governing probate in North Dakota. 

Chapter 30.1-19 of the North Dakota Century Code www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t30-1c19.pdf 
contains requirements for creditor claims against estates.  Review the entire Chapter. 

The North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district 
courts.  The rules are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp. 

The North Dakota Rules of Court apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrct. 

The North Dakota Rules of Evidence apply to civil matters in North Dakota state district courts.  
The rules are available at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrev. 

North Dakota case law is useful for interpreting what the law means for your individual 
circumstances.  When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota State District 
Court to the North Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain 
how and why they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did.  The 
opinions are case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar 
facts and issues. 

To search North Dakota case law, go to www.ndcourts.gov and click on the “Supreme Court 
Opinions” link. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law (court decisions). 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.
