      <pre>CHANGE OF VENUE RESEARCH GUIDE 

A Research Guide for a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

 
The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent 
themselves in civil matters in the North Dakota courts. 

The information provided in this research guide is intended as a starting point for your research 
into change of venue.  The information provided in this research guide is not intended for legal 
advice and cannot replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state. 

The self-represented individual must make all decisions about how to proceed. 

References to non-ND Legal Self Help Center resources are included for your convenience only.  
Including these references does not mean the ND Legal Self Help Center endorses, warrants, or 
accepts responsibility for the content or uses of the resource.  Use at your own risk. 

OVERVIEW OF CHANGE OF VENUE: 

What is venue? 

Venue is the location (county court) in which the North Dakota state court will hear the civil 
case. 

Venue is not the same as jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction is the type of court authorized to hear the 
civil case.  For example, state court or federal court, or North Dakota small claims court or 
North Dakota state district court.  Venue is determined after jurisdiction is determined.  

What is a motion for change of venue? 

A motion for change of venue asks the current North Dakota state court to allow a court in a 
different North Dakota county to hear the case. 

Why would somebody file a motion for change of venue? 

Possible examples are: (*this is not an exhaustive list*) 

• 
• 

It is too expensive to travel to the county designated for the case. 
It may be too difficult for potential witnesses to travel where the case is currently 
located. 

•  The venue of the current case was improper.

Change of Venue/Rev Mar 2019 

When do you file for a change of venue? 

You must raise the issue of change of venue at your earliest chance.  Otherwise you may 
accidentally waive it. 

You can either write your objection to the venue in your answer to the summons and complaint 
(or petition) OR file a separate motion for change of venue with the court before you file any 
more pleadings. 

(See Rule 12(b)(3) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.  A link to the Rules of Civil 
Procedure is found in the North Dakota Court Rules section below.)  

NORTH DAKOTA STATUTES: 
(North Dakota statutes are found in the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC).  The North Dakota 
Century Code contains the laws enacted by North Dakota Legislature.  The NDCC is found online 
at www.legis.nd.gov/general-information/north-dakota-century-code.  **These are not the full 
chapters and sections contained in the NDCC, please follow the links to view the laws in full.**) 

Chapter 27-05  

District Courts  

www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t27c05.html 

See Section 27-05-26. Change of venue.  A change of venue may be taken from one judge to another 
in the same district or in another district, or from one county to another, or from one district to another 
in the manner provided by law. 

Chapter 28-04  

Venue   

www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t28c04.html 

Review the entire chapter to determine the proper venue and why the court should change 
venue. 

Review the NDCC Sections related to the subject matter of the civil action.  The NDCC Sections 
related to the subject matter may have their own venue requirements. 

NORTH DAKOTA CASE LAW: 
(When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why they 
interpreted the laws or rules to decide the appeal the way they did. The opinions are case law 
and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts and issues.) 

One way to research case law related to change of venue, is to use the print version of the 
North Dakota Century Code to find the short summaries of case law after each Section of the 
Century Code.  The case law summaries are located directly following the text of the Century 
Code Section.  To view the full text of the opinion, go to www.ndcourts.gov, click on the 
“Opinions” link under “Supreme Court” and enter the case name or case citation.

Another way to research case law related to change of venue, is to search by topic at 
www.ndcourts.gov.  Click on the “Opinions” link under “Supreme Court”, then click on the drop 
down box under “Topic” link, and the on the links that apply to the topic. 

NORTH DAKOTA COURT RULES: 
(Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the dispute is conducted.  All 
of the North Dakota court rules are found online at www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules.  
**These are not the full rules contained in the North Dakota court rules, please follow the links 
to view the rules in full.**) 

Rule 12 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: Defenses and Objections. 
www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp/12 

•  See Rule 12(b)(3) for asserting the defense of improper venue in an answer to a 
summons and complaint (or petition) OR motioning for a change of venue.  

Rule 39.1 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure: Change in Location of a Hearing, 
Proceeding, or Trial; Change of Venue. www.ndcourts.gov/legal-resources/rules/ndrcivp/39-1 

LAWS CONSTANTLY CHANGE THROUGH LEGISLATION, ADMINISTRATIVE 
RULINGS AND COURT DECISIONS.   

To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and court decisions.  Notes of court decisions related to North Dakota 
law can be found in the print editions of the North Dakota Century Code.  Print editions of the 
North Dakota Century Code and North Dakota court rules are found in many North Dakota 
public and academic libraries. 

Only a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota who has agreed to represent you can give 
you legal advice.  Legal advice includes interpreting how the laws and rules apply to your 
situation.

Limited Legal Representation 

Attorneys licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions.  Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an 
attorney can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case.  You pay for the 
part of the case the attorney handled.  For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
