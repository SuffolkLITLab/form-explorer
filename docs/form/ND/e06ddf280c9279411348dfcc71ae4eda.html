the  information  is  no  longer  available  until  the  second  half  of  the  month.  We  do  not

Homework Help for Students Grades K-5

   

 

AUGUST 2020

With  school  starting  soon,  now  is  a  great  time  to  start  telling  your  students  and  their  parents  about  
the many online library resources that are available to them. These online resources give students quick 
access  to  credible  sources  covering  common  topics  that  can  be  used  for  homework  help,  projects,  and 
learning at home. Plus, with integrated tools, students can easily save, share, and download content from 
many of these resources.

This month, we’ll go through some of the resources that are geared toward students in grades K-5:

Britannica  School  includes  encyclopedias,  e-books,  magazines,  websites,  
news,  biographies,  and  other  trusted  sources.  Learning  is  interactive  
with videos, games, graphics, and animations to make it fun.

Explora  Primary  provides  students  with  easy-to-use 
age-appropriate  content  from  the  world’s 
reference books.

features  and  
leading  magazines  and  

Gale  In  Context:  Elementary  provides  credible  information  with  full-
text  proprietary  content  from  top  publishers  to  help  grade-schoolers  
become comfortable researching.

PebbleGo  and  PebbleGo  Next  help  your  student  learn  foundational  
research  skills  plus  provides  critical  early-reader  supports  like  audio  
voice-overs and text highlighting.

New Log-In Screen for the Databases

The  ODIN  office  has  rolled  out  a  new  login  page  for  the 
databases.  To  begin,  you  need  to  find  your  library  or  
school  on  the  list.  If  you  do  not  find  your  library  and  you  
are  using  a  North  Dakota  State  Library  card,  you  can  
choose our library as your library. 

After  finding  your  library  or  school,  you  will  need  to  log  in 
using  your  barcode  and  password.  Students  and  patrons 
accessing  the  databases  from  home  will  need  a  remote  
access  number  and  password  to  access  these  resources  
from home.

Once  you  are  logged  in,  you  will  have  access  to  all  of  
the databases. 

If  you  have  any  questions,  please  feel  free  to  contact  us  
at 1-800-472-2104 or statelib@nd.gov.

Collection Development Help

Looking  to  stay  on  top  of  your  book  purchases? The  Public  Library  Director’s Toolkit  LibGuide  includes  
a  tab  dedicated  to  Collection  Development.  This  includes  everything  from  professional  development  
books and short videos to a call to diversify collections. 

t  also  includes  an  entire  section  devoted  to  purchasing  new  materials.  This  includes  links  to  popular  
book  review  sites  and  magazines,  popular  book-clubs,  upcoming  releases  websites,  and  even  a  
whole host of book award lists. These lists can be a great starting point when looking for new materials  
that	may	have	your	patrons	queuing	up	at	the	door	(or	phone	lines	if	your	library	isn’t	open	to	the	public).	

s  a  librarian,  it’s  important  to  make  sure  that  the  library  serves  all  facets  of  the  community  when  
purchasing  materials,  so  looking  at  national  book  clubs,  reviews,  and  book  awards  are  great  ways  to  
diversify the library’s collection and keep the shelves fresh and exciting.

Programming Spotlight: Cast a Movie

With  almost  all  production  studios  being  closed,  movie-connoisseurs  across  the  country  are  
looking  for  ways  to  keep  their  imaginations  engaged.  This  isn’t  suggesting  that  libraries  begin 
producing	their	own	movies	(although	if	you	do,	e-mail	them	to	us),	but	why	not	help	the	movie	
studios  out  and  start  casting  movies  for  your  favorite  reboots?  Imagine  your  dream  cast  using  
favorite actors, friends, or even book characters. 

nother  twist  would  be  to  cast  a  book  out  for  it  to  become  a  movie.  What  actor  should  play  
the  lead?  The  villain?  The  sidekick?  This  is  a  fun,  light-hearted  way  for  people  to  engage  their 
imaginations.  This  prompt  can  be  posted  on  Facebook  to  have  people  share  their  favorite  
actors,  have  answers  submitted  to  the  library  for  a  contest,  or  even  be  a  writing  prompt  for  
an online writers club.

Libraries Transforming Communities

Between  February  and  May  of  this  year,  ALA  hosted  a  series  of  three  webinars  titled  
Libraries  Transforming  Communities:  Facilitation  Skills  for  Small  and  Rural  Libraries.  The 
recordings  of  each  webinar,  along  with  the  accompanying  slides  and  related  resources,  
are now available for free online, even to non-ALA members. 

Designed  specifically  for  small  and  rural  libraries,  the  workshop  helps  develop  skills  in  
hosting  important  conversations  in  your  communities,  like  how  to  keep  conversations 
constructive,  how  to  ask  questions,  and  the  best  practices  for  defusing  tension.  There  
are	 resources	 on	 facilitating	 both	 Conversation	 Cafes	 (general	 conversation)	 and	 Future	 
Search	(targeted	planning	and	problem-solving).

Breaking into Online Storytime
Part Three- “Presentation Tips”

We  have  all  watched  less  than  stellar  virtual  presentations.  How  do  we  captivate  our  audience  and  
avoid  some  of  the  pitfalls  that  come  with  speaking:  not  enough  volume,  talking  too  fast,  poor  eye  
contact, etc.?  Add to that, the challenge of pretending you have an audience? One obvious suggestion  
is to record yourself as you practice, practice, and practice some more.

But what are the steps to consider before you are ready to try recording?

•	 Speak  slowly.  Even  if  you  think  you  are  talking  slowly,  slow  it  down  some  more.  Auditory  
processing takes more time than visual processing. Children cannot listen as fast as grownups like to  
talk. The younger the audience, the more careful you need to be.

•	 Think  about  breath  support.  For  your  words  to  carry  sufficiently,  they  need  to  be  supported  with  
air,  lots  of  air!  We  have  all  listened  to  people  that  speak  loud  enough  when  they  begin  a  sentence,  
but  by  the  end  of  their  sentence,  they  are  almost  inaudible.  This  happens  from  not  supporting  the  
last part of the sentence with enough air.

•	 Let’s  even  mention  the  obvious.  Bring  the  story  to  life  by  pretending  the  characters  in  the  story  

are talking. Use different voice inflections for each character.

•	 Make eye contact with the camera. This may feel weird, but it is so necessary. Prop a stuffed animal or 

picture by the camera so you have something to talk to.

Sharing books on screen presents its own set of challenges.

•	 Get  the  pictures  as  close  as  possible  to  the  camera.  If  there  is  a  glare  from  the  pages,  how  can  you  

avoid that?

•	 Don’t  tilt  the  book  so  you  can  read  over  the  top.  Consider  having  a  second  book  to  read  from  or  
have  the  text  typed  on  a  sheet  of  paper.  This  will  take  some  practice  and  ingenuity  to  execute  
this smoothly.

•	 If you are using a platform that allows for screen sharing, find an eBook, or consider splicing pictures.

Think about your in-person Storytime and try to replicate what you can.

•	 Work  for  interactions. You  might  say, “If  you  are  wearing  blue,  raise  your  hand.”  Or “If  you  have  pets,  
show me how many on your fingers.” Likewise, if you are wearing blue, point that out, or if you have  
pets, show them how many on your fingers. 

•	 Allow  time  for  responses.  If  you  ask  questions,  pretend  you  are  hearing  their  responses?  Give  the  

children time to participate. This takes practice.

•	 Make  explicit  connections  to  everyday  life.  Take  the  story  to  their  level:  If  dragons  like  tacos,  ask  

them if they like tacos.

•	 Remember  the  best  practices  of  any  Storytime:  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Repetition  reinforces  the  

content, creates more space for understanding, and directs auditory and visual focus.

Finally,  learn  from  the  pros:  Mr.  Rogers’  Neighborhood  and  Danny  Joe’s  Treehouse  are  two  wonderful 
examples.  Virtual  Storytime  may  become  commonplace  in  your  library,  even  after  COVID  is  medically 
managed. Stretch your wings. Who knows? You just may learn to soar.

AUGUST 2020

By Jessica Robinson

Historical  fiction,  like  the  best  kind  of  travel 
writing,  takes  you  away  from  your  familiar  life  
and  sends  you  on  a  journey.  As  this  unusual 
summer winds to a close, let’s all go on a journey 
with some of 2020’s best historical fiction. 

Jane  Thynne’s  The  Words  I  Never  Wrote  is  the  
story  of  two  English  sisters  during  World  War  
II—Cordelia,  an  aspiring  journalist  who  is  stuck  
as  a  typist  in  her  male-dominated  field,  and  
(pretty	 and	 popular)	 who	 
Irene,	 a	 socialite	
marries  a  wealthy  German  man  and  moves  to 
a  Berlin  that’s  on  the  cusp  of  the  Nazi  takeover. 
Cordelia  and  Irene  keep  in  touch  over  the  years  
in  a  series  of  letters  that  are  discovered  decades 
later  by  Juno  Lambert. The  letters  don’t  tell  their 
whole  story,  so  Juno  decides  to  sit  down  at 
Cordelia’s old typewriter and fill in the blanks.

I  love  older  historical  fiction,  and  Sharon  Kay 
Penman  has  made  a  career  out  of  reaching  back 
just  where  I  want  her  to  go.  The  Land  Beyond  
the  Sea  goes  all  the  way  back  to  the  First  
Crusades,  where  a  young  King  Baldwin  IV  must 
balance  the  dangerous  intrigue  of  his  court  and 
beyond with his lifelong struggles with leprosy.

Based on a real event in 17th century Vardø, Kiran 
Millwood  Hargrave’s  The  Mercies  is  about  the 
women  in  a  small  Norwegian  coastal  town  who 
lose  their  men  when  a  terrible  storm  kills  forty 
fishermen.  The  Vardø  learn  to  survive  on  their 
own,  only  to  have  their  community  threatened  
by  a  Scottish  witch-hunter  and  his  young 
Norwegian wife.

Poor  Mary  Bennet.  If  she’s  remembered  at  all 
among  her  sisters,  it’s  usually  that  she’s  the 
awkward  one,  more  at  home  with  a  book  than  
in  the  middle  of  a  conversation.  I  get  it,  Mary.  
So  does  Janice  Hadlow,  who  presents  a  different 
look  at  Pride  and  Prejudice’s  forgotten  middle  
child  in  The  Other  Bennet  Sister  by  following  her 

on  a  journey  of  self-discovery  and—because  it  
is about an Austen heroine—romance.  

Rishi  Reddi’s  Passage  West  shines  a  light  on  the 
pre-WWI  United  States  as  it  follows  an  Indian 
immigrant  named  Ram  Singh  to  1913  California  
in  the  beautiful  but  deadly 
Imperial  Valley.  
Singh  left  his  young  wife  and  their  newborn  
son  to  become  a  sharecropper  on  his  friend’s 
family  cantaloupe 
farm.  But  his  dreams  of 
American  prosperity  quickly  turn  sour  when  
strong  anti-immigrant  sentiment  threatens  him 
and his friend’s family.

Let’s  go  back  to  an  especially  strange  moment 
in  world  history—the  1936  Olympics  held  in 
Nazi  Germany.  This  is  where  Elise  Hooper  sets 
Fast  Girls,  the  story  of  three  American  athletes—
Betty,  a  member  of  the  first  women’s  track  and

Legal Research Resources for the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act 
Submitted by Catie Palsgraaf, Acting North Dakota Supreme Court Law Librarian

North  Dakota  has  a  significant  number  of  
legal  
active  military  service  members  and  a 
research  topic  of  interest  is  the  Servicemembers  
Civil	 Relief	 Act	
(SCRA).	 The	 SCRA	 contains	 
protections  for  U.S.  military  service  members  
while on active duty.

Following  are  legal  research  and  other  resources  
in  North  Dakota  for  the  Servicemembers  Civil  
Relief Act as it relates to civil court processes.

WHAT IS THE SERVICEMEMBERS CIVIL RELIEF 
ACT (SCRA)

The	 Servicemembers	 Civil	 Relief	 Act	 (SCRA)	 is	 a	
federal  law  whose  main  purpose  is  to  lessen  the  
legal  and  financial  burdens  on  military  service 
members while they’re on active duty.

This  article  focuses  on  the  protections  involving 
the  courts,  however,  the  protections  included  in  
the SCRA extend beyond the court system.

See  the  end  of  the  article  for  legal  research  
resources  that  include  links  to  information  about  
all of the SCRA protections.

WHO IS AN ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER 
UNDER THE SCRA?

The  following  are  active-duty  military  service 
members who are protected under the SCRA:

•	 Army,  Air  Force,  Coast  Guard,  Marine  Corps,  

and Navy service members on active duty;

•	 Army,  Air  Force,  Coast  Guard,  Marine  Corps,  

and Navy reservists on active duty;

•	 National  Guard  service  members  mobilized 
than  30 

federal  orders 

for  more 

under 
consecutive days; and

•	 Commissioned  officers  of  the  Public  Health 
(PHS)	 and	 National	 Oceanic	 and	
(NOAA)	 on	 

Service

active duty.

WHAT ARE THE CIVIL COURT PROCESS 
PROTECTIONS IN THE SCRA?

Default  Judgments:  A  default  judgment  may 
be  granted  by  a  North  Dakota  state  court  when 
the  Defendant  in  the  civil  action  doesn’t  answer 
the  documents  that  start  the  action 
in  the  
time allowed.

Before  a  North  Dakota  state  court  can  enter  a  
default  judgment  in  a  civil  action,  the  Plaintiff,  
the  party  who  started  the  civil  action,  must  tell  
the  court  whether  the  Defendant  is  on  active  
duty.  The  Plaintiff  must  explain  the  research  they 
did to figure out if the Defendant is on active duty.

If  the  judge  or  judicial  referee  is  satisfied  that 
the  Defendant  isn’t  on  active  duty,  the  judge  or  
judicial referee may grant a default judgment.

If  the  military  service  member  was  on  active  duty 
when  the  default  judgment  was  granted,  the  
service  member  may  make  a  motion  to  have  
the  case  re-opened  and  the  default  judgment 
set  aside  as  though  it  didn’t  happen.  The  service 
member can also request a court-appointed lawyer 
to represent them.

Stay:  A  stay  means  that  nothing  will  happen  in  
the civil  action  until the  stay is lifted  by the North 
Dakota  state  court.  In  other  words,  the  case  is  on  
hold  until  the 
judicial  referee  says  
otherwise.

judge  or 

A military service member on active duty may ask  
a  North  Dakota  state  court  to  stay  their  civil  case  
for as long as their active service materially affects 
their  ability  to  take  part  in  the  case. This  includes 
reservists  and  National  Guard  members  called  to 
active duty.

The  military  service  member  may  make  a  motion  
for  a  stay  when  they  believe  the  civil  action  may

Eviction:  An  eviction  is  an  accelerated,  or  sped 
up,  civil  court  action  to  determine  the  right  to  
physically	possess	the	leased	(rented)	property.

As  long  as  the  military  service  member  on  active  
duty  pays  less  than  a  certain  dollar  amount  in 
monthly	 rent	 (in	 2019	 the	 maximum	 amount	 
was	 $3,851.03),	 the	 service	 member	 can	 request	
a  delay  of  90  days  before  the  judge  can  sign  an 
eviction order.

long. 

Foreclosure:  A  foreclosure  is  a  civil  court  process 
where  a  lender,  such  as  a  bank  or  credit  union, 
attempts  to  recover  the  amount  owed  on  a  
defaulted  loan  by  taking  ownership  and  selling  
the mortgaged property.

A  military  service  member  on  active  duty,  who  
falls  behind  on  their  mortgage  because  they’re  
on  active  duty,  may  request  a  stay  of  the  
foreclosure  civil  action.  They  may  also  request  
that the judge adjust the amount of the loan.

CAN SCRA PROTECTIONS BE WAIVED?

Yes,  a  military  service  member  may  waive,  or  give  
up,  many  of  the  SCRA  protections.  Generally, 
the  waiver  must  be  in  writing  and  meet  certain 
requirements,  depending  on  the  protection  the 
service member is giving up.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
