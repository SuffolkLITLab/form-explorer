      <pre>DEMAND FOR FILING  
SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT (PETITION) IN CIVIL ACTIONS 
An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves in 
civil matters in the North Dakota state courts. The information provided in this informational guide 
isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to same requirements and responsibilities as a lawyer, 
even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures. If you’re unsure if this information suits your 
circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law. This covers basic information about making 
a demand for filing the summons and complaint (or petition) in a North Dakota State District Court 
civil action. The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the information 
provided. The information can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed in the state of 
North Dakota. Use at your own risk. 

 

Caution! 
A self-represented individual may only represent themselves in a North Dakota state district 
court civil action. 

If a Plaintiff/Petitioner or Defendant/Respondent is an artificial person, such as a business, 
corporation or limited liability company, a non-attorney can’t represent the artificial person in 
a North Dakota state district court civil action.  Consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota.

Why Isn’t the Case Number on the Summons and Complaint (or Petition)? 

When you’re served the Summons and Complaint (or Petition), the documents won’t have a 
case number. In North Dakota, a civil action starts with service of a Summons and a copy of 
the Complaint (or Petition) on the Defendant. A Summons and Complaint (or Petition) aren’t 
required to be filed to start a civil action. You and the clerk of court won’t be able to find a 
case number in North Dakota state district court case files. 

•  The Plaintiff can’t file the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) until the Plaintiff gets 

proof of service that they served copies on the Defendant. The Summons and Complaint 
(or Petition) and proof of service are then filed together and a case number is assigned.  

If you want to take part in the case, you must serve your written Answer to the Summons and 
Complaint (or Petition) within 21 days after you were served. You serve your written Answer 
to the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) without a case number. (See Answering a 
Summons and Complaint.) 

• 

If you don’t serve your written Answer within 21 calendar days after the date you were 
served, you may be found in default. This means you won’t have a chance to take part in 
the case or be heard on the matter. The court may give the Plaintiff what they 
requested in the Complaint (or Petition) without your input.  

Don’t Wait to Serve Your Answer! If you wait until the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) 
are filed before serving your written Answer, you may miss your 21 day deadline. If you miss 
your deadline, the Plaintiff is allowed to ask the court to find you in default.  

What is a Demand for Filing? 

A Demand for Filing is the process where you, the Defendant, demand in writing that the 
Plaintiff file the initiating pleadings, also called the Summons and Complaint (or Petition), in the 
case within 20 calendar days after being served the Demand for Filing.   

If the Plaintiff doesn’t file the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) that were served on you 
within 20 calendar days, the action is void, meaning the action is over.  

(Be aware that the Plaintiff may be able to start the same action again by serving another 
Summons and Complaint (or Petition)). 

Exception: If the Plaintiff makes a motion to the court within 60 calendar days after being 
served the Demand for Filing, and the court finds excusable neglect, the Summons and 
Complaint (or Petition) will be considered valid, which means the action will continue.

How Do I Make a Demand for Filing? 

Remember your 21 day deadline for serving your Answer.  Filing doesn’t meet your deadline! 

If the Plaintiff hasn’t filed the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) and you want to file your 
written Answer and proof of service, you have two options: 

You can file your copy of the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) which were 
Option 1. 
served on you and your original written Answer and proof of service. You’ll be required to pay 
the $80 filing fee for the Plaintiff and the $50 filing fee for you, the Defendant.  

•  You, the Defendant, must serve a Notice of Filing on the Plaintiff (or Plaintiff’s lawyer.) 

•  After the court makes a judgment in the case, you may ask the court to award you the 
cost of the $80 filing fee. (See Rule 54(e) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.) 

You can serve a Demand for Filing demanding the Plaintiff file their Summons 
Option 2. 
and Complaint (or Petition) within 20 calendar days of being served the Demand for Filing. If 
the Plaintiff doesn’t file the Summons and Complaint (or Petition) within the deadline, service 
of the Summons on you is void, meaning the current action is over.  

•  However, if the Plaintiff misses the 20 day deadline, they can make a motion to the 

court within 60 calendar days after service of the Demand for Filing. If the court finds 
excusable neglect, the case will continue.  

How Do I Arrange to Service the Demand for Filing on the Plaintiff? 

You, the Defendant, must arrange for your Demand for Filing to be served as follows: 

• 

If served on the Plaintiff’s lawyer use one of the options in Rule 5(b) of the North Dakota 
Rules of Civil Procedure. Review Rule 5(b) carefully! 

o  Check to see who signed the Summons and Complaint (or Petition). If a lawyer 

signed the documents, use this method for service. 

o  You may also want to review Information and Instructions for Service After a 

District Court Civil Action Has Started. 

• 

If served on the Plaintiff because the Plaintiff isn’t represented, use one of the options 
in Rule 4(d) of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. Review Rule 4(d) carefully! 

o  You may also want to review Information and Instructions for Service to Start a 

District Court Civil Action.

North Dakota Century Code. Print editions of the North Dakota Century Code are available in

situation.

Limited Legal Representation 

Attorneys licensed to practice in North Dakota may provide Limited Legal Representation in civil 
actions. Limited Legal Representation (sometimes called “unbundling”) is a way that an 
attorney can help you with part of your case while you do the rest of your case. You pay for the 
part of the case the attorney handled. For example: 

•  You may want an attorney to give you an expert opinion about your options, or your 

legal rights and responsibilities; 

hearings yourself; 

•  You can consult with an attorney to prepare or review your paperwork, but attend 

•  You can represent yourself through the whole case, and periodically consult with an 

attorney who can coach you on the law, procedures and strategy; 

•  You can do the preparation yourself and hire an attorney just to make the court 

appearance for you. 

You and the attorney must agree in writing to Limited Legal Representation.
