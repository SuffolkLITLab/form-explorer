An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Civil Court Process 

 

 

The North Dakota Legal Self Help Center provides resources to people who represent themselves in 
civil matters in the North Dakota state courts.  The information provided in this informational guide 
isn’t intended for legal advice but only as a general guide to a civil court process. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you’ll need to do additional research to prepare. 

When you represent yourself, you’re expected to know and follow the law, including: 

•  State or federal laws that apply to your case; 
•  Case law, also called court opinions, that applies to your case; and 
•  Court rules that apply to your case, which may include: 
o  North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Court; 
o  North Dakota Rules of Evidence; 
o  North Dakota Administrative Rules and Orders; 
o  Any local court rules. 

Links to the laws, case law, and court rules can be found at ndcourts.gov. 

A glossary with definitions of legal terms is available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help. 

When you represent yourself, you’re held to the same requirements and responsibilities as a 
lawyer, even if you don’t understand the rules or procedures.  If you’re unsure if this information 
suits your circumstances, consult a lawyer. 

•  For more information about finding a lawyer, go to ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/finding-a-

lawyer. 

This information isn’t a complete statement of the law.  This covers basic information about the 
process of registering an out-of-state or tribal court custody or visitation order with a North Dakota 
state district court.  The Center isn’t responsible for any consequences that may result from the 
information provided.  The information can’t replace the advice of competent legal counsel licensed 
in the state of North Dakota.  Use at your own risk. 

IMPORTANT! Registration alone DOESN’T transfer the entire case to North Dakota.

STEPS TO REGISTER AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT 
CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDER 

Step One: 

The Petitioner Creates the Registration Documents; Gets Two Copies of the 
Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court Custody Order 

1) Letter, petition, or other document requesting registration; 2) Declaration 
with required information; 3) Two copies of the out-of-state court or tribal court 
custody or visitation order, one MUST be a certified copy; and 4) Declaration of 
Identification of all persons awarded custody or visitation. 

Step Two: 

The Petitioner Files the Registration Documents with the Clerk of District 
Court; Pays the Filing Fee 

The filing fee is $10.00. 

Step Three:  Notice of Registration is Given by the Clerk of District Court 

Written Notice of Registration is served (given) to all persons awarded custody 
or visitation in the order. 

Step Four:  Within 20 Days of Notice, Any Person Awarded Custody or Visitation 

(Respondents) May Challenge the Registration by Requesting a Hearing 

The request for hearing must be made in writing and within 20 days of service of 
the Notice of Registration. 

Challenges are limited to 1) the court that issued the order didn’t have 
jurisdiction; 2) The order to be registered has been vacated, stayed, or modified; 
and 3) the person challenging registration received incorrect notice of the court 
proceeding that resulted in the out-of-state court or tribal court order. 

Step 
Five(A): 

If a Hearing was Requested and Scheduled in Step Four, Attend the Hearing 

The North Dakota State District Court shall confirm the registered order unless 
the person challenging registration proves one or more of the three challenges 
listed in Step Four. 

Step 
Five(B): 

If a Hearing WASN’T Requested and Scheduled in Step Four, Registration is 
Confirmed. 

All persons awarded custody or visitation in the order are notified that 
registration is confirmed.

SECTION ONE: 

INFORMATION ABOUT REGISTERING AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDER 

WHAT IS REGISTERING AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY 
OR VISITATION ORDER? 

An out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order is an order issued by an out-
of-state court or a tribal court that governs the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation of 
a minor child. 

If an out-of-state court or tribal court issued an order governing the legal custody, physical 
custody, or visitation of a minor child, and the order granted you custody or visitation, you 
may ask a North Dakota state district court to register your out-of-state court or tribal court 
order for recognition in North Dakota. 

Registration allows the North Dakota state district court to recognize that the out-of-state court 
or tribal court custody or visitation order exists, that the order is in effect, and the order is the 
most current version. 

Any person awarded custody or visitation may challenge the registration for limited reasons. 

Registration is the first step BEFORE making other requests, such as enforcing your out-of-state 
court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

DOES REGISTERING AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR 
VISITATION ORDER TRANSFER THE ENTIRE CASE TO NORTH DAKOTA? 

No.  Registration alone DOESN’T transfer the entire case to North Dakota.  The entire case 
remains with the out-of-state court or tribal court until the out-of-state court or tribal court 
says they give up their authority (jurisdiction), AND a North Dakota state district court says 
they’ll take over authority (jurisdiction). 

Transferring an out-of-state court or tribal court custody case to a North Dakota state district 
court is a complicated and confusing process.  The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t have 
information or resources available.  Consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North Dakota for 
assistance.

DOES THE ND LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER HAVE FORMS TO REGISTER AN OUT-OF-
STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDER, OR TO 
CHALLENGE REGISTRATION OF THE ORDER? 

This Informational Guide includes forms you may use to register your out-of-state court or 
tribal court custody or visitation order, and to challenge registration of the order.  There is no 
guarantee that all judges and courts will accept forms available through the ND Legal Self Help 
Center. 

If the form you need isn’t included in this guide, the form isn’t available through the ND Legal 
Self Help Center. You may need to create some of your own legal documents. 

If a form isn’t available and you need to create your own legal document, a variety of General-
Use template forms are available at ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/general-use-forms. 

You may find the General-Use template forms of interest as a starting point for creating your 
own legal documents. 

OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDERS 
THAT MAY BE REGISTERED 

The following types of cases, also called child custody proceedings, which result in an out-of-
state court or tribal court custody or visitation order, or determination, may be registered using 
the process in this Informational Guide: 

•  Abuse; 
•  Dependency; 
•  Divorce; 
•  Guardianship; 
•  Legal Separation; 
•  Neglect; 
•  Paternity; 
•  Protection from Domestic Violence; and 
•  Termination of Parental Rights;

visitation. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Reg OOS/Tribal Custody Order/Rev Oct 2021 

OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR TRIBAL COURT ORDERS THAT CAN’T BE REGISTERED 

Out-of-state court or tribal court orders, or determinations, resulting from the following types 
of cases, CAN’T be registered using this process: 

Juvenile Delinquency; or 

• 
•  Emancipation. 

IMPORTANT: Non-North Dakota child support orders can’t be registered using the process in 
this Informational Guide.  Non-North Dakota child support orders are registered using the 
process in the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.  The ND Legal Self Help Center doesn’t 
have forms available to register Non-North Dakota child support orders. 

COURTS WHOSE CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDERS MAY BE REGISTERED 

Custody orders issued by a court of the following may be registered using the process in this 
Informational Guide: 

•  A state of the United States; 
•  The District of Columbia; 
•  Puerto Rico; 
•  United States Virgin Islands; 
•  Any territory or insular possession of the United States; 
•  An Indian tribe or band, or Alaskan native village, which is recognized by federal law or 

formally acknowledged by a state of the United States; and 

•  A foreign country, if certain requirements are met.  (See Chapter 14-14.1.) 

WHAT IF I NEED NORTH DAKOTA TO ENFORCE MY OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDER? 

Enforcing an out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order is a two-step 
process. 

Step One: Registration is the first step to requesting that a North Dakota state district court 
enforce your out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

Step Two: Petitioning for expedited enforcement is the second step to requesting that a North 
Dakota state district court enforce the terms of your registered out-of-state court or tribal court 
custody or visitation order. 

NDLSHC Info Guide 

Page 5 of 15 

Reg OOS/Tribal Custody Order/Rev Oct 2021 

However, the two steps may be combined when you need to petition a North Dakota state 
district court for expedited enforcement, but haven’t yet registered the out-of-state court or 
tribal court custody or visitation order. 

For information about enforcement, see “Enforcing an Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court 
Custody Order: An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Civil Court Process” at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/foreign-custody-and-visitation. 

WHAT IF I NEED NORTH DAKOTA TO MODIFY MY OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDER? 

In order for a North Dakota state district court to modify an out-of-state or tribal court custody 
or visitation order, both the North Dakota state district court and the out-of-state or tribal court 
MUST agree that North Dakota should take over authority (jurisdiction) of the entire case. 

Modifying the order may only happen AFTER a North Dakota state district court takes over 
authority (jurisdiction) of the entire case. 

Asking a North Dakota state district court to modify an out-of-state court or tribal court custody 
or visitation order is a complicated and confusing process.  The ND Legal Self Help Center 
doesn’t have information or resources available.  Consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota for assistance. 

DEFINITIONS OF SOME COMMONLY USED TERMS 

(In 2009, the North Dakota State Legislature changed the term “custody” to “residential 
responsibility” and changed the term “visitation” to “parenting time.”) 

Child custody determination: An out-of-state court or tribal court judgment, decree, or other 
order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation of a minor child. 
The term includes a permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order. The term doesn’t 
include an order relating to child support or other monetary obligation of an individual. 

Child custody proceeding: See the “Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court Custody or Visitation 
Orders that May be Registered” section on Page 4. 

Initial determination: The first child custody determination concerning a particular child. 

Issuing court: The out-of-state court or tribal court that made the child custody determination 
for which registration is sought. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Reg OOS/Tribal Custody Order/Rev Oct 2021 

Jurisdiction: Jurisdiction is the power of a court to inquire into the facts, apply the law, and 
determine and pronounce judgment.  Generally speaking, there are two types of jurisdiction, 
subject matter and personal. 

•  Subject Matter Jurisdiction: A court’s power to hear and determine the type of case or 
controversy.  Comes from the constitution and statutes (laws enacted by a legislature).  
Subject matter jurisdiction can’t be agreed to, consented to, or waived. 

•  Personal Jurisdiction: A court’s power over the parties.  A party can voluntarily submit to 

the personal jurisdiction of a court. 

Modified determination: Changes, replaces, supersedes, or is otherwise made after a previous 
determination concerning the same child, whether or not it is made by the court that made the 
previous determination. 

Person acting as a parent: A person, other than a parent, who has been awarded legal custody 
by an out-of-state court or tribal court whose custody order may be registered. 

Stayed determination: Temporary suspension of a custody determination.  The decision to stay 
a determination is made by a court. 

Vacated determination: Set aside or void a custody determination.  The decision to vacate a 
determination is made by a court. 

Venue: The location (North Dakota county) in which the North Dakota State District Court will 
hear the case.  Venue isn’t the same as jurisdiction.  Venue is determined only after jurisdiction 
is determined. 

LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO REGISTERING AN OUT-OF-STATE COURT OR 
TRIBAL COURT CUSTODY OR VISITATION ORDER 

Chapter 14-14.1 of the North Dakota Century Code is known as the Uniform Child Custody 
Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, or UCCJEA.  The UCCJEA governs registration and 
enforcement of an out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order in North Dakota. 

See Section 14-14.1-25 of Chapter 14-14.1 for the requirements for registering a custody or 
visitation order. 

Laws constantly change through legislation, administrative rulings and case law (court 
decisions).  To determine how a law applies to your situation, review the applicable law or laws, 
administrative rulings and case law.

out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order, also called Respondents, have 20 
days to request a hearing in writing to contest or challenge the registration. 

Challenges to the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order are limited: 

A Respondent’s contests, or challenges, to registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court 
custody or visitation order are limited to the following: 

1.  The court that issued the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order 

didn’t have jurisdiction to issue the order. 

o  See North Dakota Century Code Sections 14-14.1-12 through 14-14.1-21 for 

jurisdiction requirements that apply to this challenge. 

2.  The out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order sought to be registered 

has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court that had jurisdiction to do so. 

3.  The person contesting registration was entitled to notice before the out-of-state court 
or tribal court custody or visitation order was made by the court that issued the order, 
but notice wasn’t given according to the standards of North Dakota Century Code 
Section 14-14.1-07. 

o  See North Dakota Century Code Section 14-14.1-07 for the notice standards that 

apply to this challenge. 

You, the Respondent, create the written request for hearing to contest, or challenge, 
registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order: 

The Respondent contesting, or challenging, registration must be awarded custody or visitation 
in the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

A form to request a hearing to contest registration of an out-of-state court or tribal court 
custody or visitation order is found at the end of this Informational Guide. 

•  Fill out the caption (top) of the form EXACTLY the same as the caption of the petition to 

register the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

Make a copy of your completed request for your records. 

NDLSHC Info Guide

Reg OOS/Tribal Custody Order/Rev Oct 2021 

You, the Respondent, file the written request for hearing with the Clerk of District Court: 

The person requesting the hearing files their original written request for hearing document with 
the Clerk of District Court in the North Dakota county where the order was registered. 

Contact information for clerks of court by county is available online at ndcourts.gov/court-
locations. 

STEP FIVE (A): ATTEND THE HEARING (If Requested and Scheduled) 

If a Respondent requested a hearing within 20 days of notice of registration AND the hearing 
was scheduled, ATTEND THE HEARING: 

The Respondent contesting or challenging registration of the out-of-state court or tribal court 
custody or visitation order is required to prove their reason or reasons at the hearing.  The 
Respondent’s challenge is limited to: 

1.  The out-of-state court or tribal court that issued the out-of-state court or tribal court 

custody or visitation order didn’t have jurisdiction to issue the order; 

2.  The out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order sought to be registered 
has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court that had jurisdiction to do so; or 
3.  The person contesting registration was entitled to notice before the custody order was 
made by the out-of-state court or tribal court that issued the order, but notice was not 
given according to the standards of North Dakota Century Code Section 14-14.1-07. 

The Petitioner who registered the out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order 
may challenge the proof the Respondent presents at the hearing. 

If the Respondent who contested, or challenged, registration doesn’t prove their reason(s) for 
their challenge, the North Dakota State District Court judge or judicial referee shall confirm the 
registered order. 

STEP FIVE (B): IF A HEARING ISN’T REQUESTED WITHIN 20 DAYS OF NOTICE OF 
REGISTRATON, REGISTRATION IS CONFIRMED. 

If a Respondent DOESN’T request a hearing to contest or challenge registration within 20 days 
of notice of registration: 

If a hearing isn’t requested within 20 days after the service of the notice of registration, 
registration is confirmed and the parties are notified of the confirmation.

Reg OOS/Tribal Custody Order/Rev Oct 2021 

The effect of a confirmed registration is the North Dakota State District Court recognizes the 
out-of-state court or tribal court custody or visitation order exists, the order is in effect, and the 
order is the most current version. 

Registration is the first step BEFORE making other requests, such as enforcing your out-of-state 
court or tribal court custody or visitation order. 

For information about enforcement, see “Enforcing an Out-of-State Court or Tribal Court 
Custody Order: An Informational Guide to a North Dakota Civil Court Process” at 
ndcourts.gov/legal-self-help/foreign-custody-and-visitation. 

For information about transferring the entire case to North Dakota, or modifying the out-of-
state court or tribal court custody or visitation order, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in 
North Dakota for assistance.
