STEPS TO OBJECTING TO THE PERSON WHO WANTS TO BE THE 
GUARDIAN OF A CHILD AND DEMAND A HEARING 

Step 1 – Within 10 Days After Service of the Summons and Petition for 
Guardianship, File a Written Objection to the Guardian and a Demand for 
Hearing with the Juvenile Court. 

When a petition for guardianship is based on either: 

1.  The written consent of ALL living parents whose parental rights have not been 

terminated by court order; 

OR 

2.  All of the child’s parents are either: 

a.  Deceased; or 
b.  Their parental rights were terminated by court order, 

The Juvenile Court may waive, or not hold, an in-court hearing before appointing a guardian, or 
guardians, for the child. 

Any person, including the child, who is served the Summons and Petition for Guardianship 
may object in writing to the person who wants to become the child’s guardian and demand 
an in-court hearing. 

If you are served a copy of the Summons and Petition for Guardianship, and the Summons 
states that the in-court hearing is waived, you may file your written objection to the guardian 
and demand that the Juvenile Court schedule an in-court hearing before appointing a guardian. 

You MUST file your written objection with the District Court WITHIN 10 DAYS after you are 
served a copy of the Summons and Petition for Guardianship. 

To calculate 10 days after service: 

•  DO NOT include the date that triggers the period. 
•  Count every calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. 
• 

If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, move forward to the next day that 
is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

Object to 27-20.1 Guardian/Jul 2019 

First, the person objecting to the proposed guardian and demanding a hearing completes: 

•  Objection to Appointment of Guardian and Demand for Hearing (Form: JCG FT 2). 

To complete Objection to Appointment of Guardian and Demand for Hearing (Form: JCG FT 2): 

•  The caption (top) of the form: 

o  Complete exactly as the caption appears in the Summons you were served. 

•  Read each paragraph completely. 

o  When you date and sign this form, you are swearing that all of the information 

on the form is accurate and true. 

•  Complete all paragraphs that require you to type or write information. 
•  Date and sign this form in the presence of a Notary Public or Clerk of Court.  You will 

need to show a driver’s license or photo identification card so the Notary Public or Clerk 
of Court can verify your identity. 

Make a copy of the completed Objection to Appointment of Guardian and Demand for Hearing 
(Form: JCG FT 2) for your records. 

Second, the person objecting to the proposed guardian and demanding a hearing files the 
following ORIGINAL completed form with the Juvenile Court where the guardianship case is 
filed: 

•  Objection to Appointment of Guardian and Demand for Hearing (Form: JCG FT 2) for 

your records. 

The written objection MUST be filed WITHIN 10 DAYS after you are served a copy of the 
Summons and Petition for Guardianship. 

Step 2 – The Juvenile Court Schedules an In-Court Hearing. 

The Juvenile Court will begin proceedings to determine who should be appointed guardian of 
the child.  You will receive a notice of hearing by mail with the date, time and location of the in-
court hearing. 

You must attend the in-court hearing and be prepared to prove your case.
