      <pre>ANSWERING A MOTION IN A CIVIL ACTION 

CHECKLIST 

This is a basic checklist for answering a motion in a civil action in North Dakota State District 
Court.  There may be additional documents and procedures for your particular type of 
motion.  If you are unsure how to proceed, consult a lawyer licensed to practice in North 
Dakota. 

THE “MOTIONS” SECTION OF THE GUIDE TO A CIVIL ACTION on the ND Legal Self Help Center 
website has additional information and resources. 

A motion is a written request to the court for an order.  Motions may be made after the 
summons and complaint are filed with the court.  

The party making the motion is called the “Moving Party.” The party answering the motion is 
called the “Opposing Party.” 

The moving party notifies the opposing party of the motion by serving copies of the motion 
documents on the opposing party.   

If an opposing party to the motion is served by handing it to the opposing party, leaving it at the 
opposing party’s office or residence, the opposing party has fourteen (14) days after service of 
the motion documents to serve and file their answer to the motion in writing. 

If an opposing party to the motion is served by mail or third party commercial carrier, the 
opposing party has seventeen (17) days after service of the motion documents to serve and file 
their answer to the motion in writing. 

An answer to a motion in a civil action is made up of a set of documents, including: 

•  Answer Brief to Motion; 
•  Affidavit in Support of Answer Brief; 
•  Other Supporting Documents; and 
•  Notice of Hearing on Motion (if the opposing party requests a hearing). 

Carefully Review the Motion Documents: 

Carefully review the notice of motion, motion, brief in support of motion, affidavit in support of 
motion and any other supporting documents you received. 

 

NDLSHC Website:

Answer a Motion Checklist/Rev Mar 2019 

The notice of motion will provide information about who to serve and the deadline to serve the 
written answer to the motion. 

The other documents will list the legal authority that the moving party believes supports their 
motion request, and explain how and why the moving party believes the law, case law or court 
rules support their request. 

Calculate the Deadline to Answer the Motion: 

If the motion was served by handing it to the opposing party, leaving it at the opposing party’s 
office or residence, the opposing party has fourteen (14) days after service of the motion 
documents to serve and file their answer to the motion in writing. 

If the motion is served by mail or third party commercial carrier, the opposing party has 
seventeen (17) days after service of the motion documents to serve and file their answer to the 
motion in writing. 

Review the laws and rules from the motion documents to determine if the timeframe to answer 
the motion is different.   

  Date the motion documents were served on you, the opposing party: _______________ 
(Review Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure for service of motions.) 

  Using calendar days, calculate the date your written answer to motion must be served 
on the moving party and any other opposing parties: ____________________________ 

Make a Copy of the Brief in Support of Motion to Mark Up: 

Make at least one copy of the moving party’s brief in support of motion.  Using the checklists on 
pages 2 and 3 go through your working copy of the brief in support of motion with a pencil and 
make notes.  Make note of any points you want to make in your answer to the motion. Use 
your marked-up copy of the brief in support of motion, and pages 2 and 3 to help you organize 
and prepare your written answer to the motion. 

Research North Dakota Laws and Court Rules: 

Information and resources for legal research are available through the North Dakota Legal Self 
Help Center.  Go to www.ndcourts.gov and click on the “Self Help” link.  Scroll to the “Legal 
Research” section. 

Review the motion and brief in support of the motion carefully!

Answer a Motion Checklist/Rev Mar 2019 

A motion must include the legal authority that supports the motion request. Any motions to the 
court must refer to the laws, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and court rules, or a 
combination of all three, upon which the motion is filed. 

The brief in support of the motion explains how and why the moving party believes the law, 
case law, and/or court rule supports the moving party’s request. 

Research the laws, North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and/or court rules the moving party 
used to make their arguments. Determine if the laws and rules stand for what the moving party 
says they do. 

Conduct your own research to determine if there are other laws, North Dakota Supreme Court 
case law, and/or court rules that support your argument. 

  Does the brief in support of motion include any laws enacted by the North Dakota State 

Legislature?  Do any laws enacted by the Legislature support your answer to the 
motion? 

The North Dakota Century Code contains laws enacted by the Legislature.  List the 
specific laws from the brief in support of the motion and any laws that support your 
answer: _________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 

  Does the brief in support of motion include any North Dakota Supreme Court case law  

Does any case law support your answer to the motion? 

When the decision of a case is appealed from a North Dakota District Court to the North 
Dakota Supreme Court, the Supreme Court writes their opinion to explain how and why 
they interpreted the laws or rules to decide the case the way they did. The opinions are 
case law and are followed by North Dakota courts deciding later cases with similar facts 
and issues. List the specific case law from the brief in support of the motion and any 
case law that supports your answer:  
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________.

  Does the brief in support of motion include any court rules?  Do any court rules support 

your answer to the motion? 

North Dakota Court rules govern how a dispute makes its way to court and how the 
dispute is conducted.  List the specific court rules from the brief in support of the 
motion and any court rules that support your answer: 
________________________________________________________________________ 
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________. 

(The North Dakota Century Code, and North Dakota Supreme Court case law, and North Dakota 
court rules are also found in print in many North Dakota public and academic libraries.)

  Make a copy of each supporting document, if any, for the moving party and each 

opposing party, if any, plus one copy to keep as a record. 

Service of Answer to Motion Documents: 

The opposing party must serve copies of their answer to motion documents on the moving 
party and each opposing party, if any, in the civil action.  A signed and notarized affidavit of 
service is proof that service occurred. 

  Review service requirements for motions in Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil 
Procedure.  For more information about service requirements after a civil action has 
started, go to the Service link on the ND Legal Self Help Center website.  

  Obtain the address for service for the moving party and each opposing party, if any.  If
