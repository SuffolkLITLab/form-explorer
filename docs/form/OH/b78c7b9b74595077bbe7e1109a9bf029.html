      <pre>POWER OF ATTORNEY 

I, the undersigned, residing at _____________________, in the county of ______________, state of 
_____________, hereby appoint the child's grandparent, ______________________, residing at 
___________________________, in the county of _________________, in the state of Ohio, with whom 
the child of whom I am the parent, guardian, or custodian is residing, my attorney in fact to exercise any 
and all of my rights and responsibilities regarding the care, physical custody, and control of the child, 
___________________, born ______________, having social security number (optional) 
________________, except my authority to consent to marriage or adoption of the child 
_______________________, and to perform all acts necessary in the execution of the rights and 
responsibilities hereby granted, as fully as I might do if personally present. The rights I am transferring 
under this power of attorney include the ability to enroll the child in school, to obtain from the school 
district educational and behavioral information about the child, to consent to all school-related matters 
regarding the child, and to consent to medical, psychological, or dental treatment for the child. This 
transfer does not affect my rights in any future proceedings concerning the custody of the child or the 
allocation of the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the child and does not give the attorney 
in fact legal custody of the child. This transfer does not terminate my right to have regular contact with 
the child. 

I hereby certify that I am transferring the rights and responsibilities designated in this power of attorney 
because one of the following circumstances exists: 

1.  I am: (a) Seriously ill, incarcerated, or about to be incarcerated, (b) Temporarily unable to provide 
financial support or parental guidance to the child, (c) Temporarily unable to provide adequate 
care and supervision of the child because of my physical or mental condition, (d) Homeless or 
without a residence because the current residence is destroyed or otherwise uninhabitable, or (e) 
In or about to enter a residential treatment program for substance abuse; 
 

2.  I am a parent of the child, the child's other parent is deceased, and I have authority to execute the 

power of attorney; or 
 

3.  I have a well-founded belief that the power of attorney is in the child's best interest. 

I hereby certify that I am not transferring my rights and responsibilities regarding the child for the 
purpose of enrolling the child in a school or school district so that the child may participate in the 
academic or interscholastic athletic programs provided by that school or district. 

I understand that this document does not authorize a child support enforcement agency to redirect child 
support payments to the grandparent designated as attorney in fact. I further understand that to have an 
existing child support order modified or a new child support order issued administrative or judicial 
proceedings must be initiated. 

If there is a court order naming me the residential parent and legal custodian of the child who is the 
subject of this power of attorney and I am the sole parent signing this document, I hereby certify that one 
of the following is the case: 

1.  I have made reasonable efforts to locate and provide notice of the creation of this power of 

attorney to the other parent and have been unable to locate that parent; 
 

2.  The other parent is prohibited from receiving a notice of relocation; or 

3.  The parental rights of the other parent have been terminated by order of a juvenile court. 

This POWER OF ATTORNEY is valid until the occurrence of whichever of the following events occurs 
first: (1) I revoke this POWER OF ATTORNEY in writing and give notice of the revocation to the 
grandparent designated as attorney in fact and the juvenile court with which this POWER OF 
ATTORNEY was filed; (2) the child ceases to reside with the grandparent designated as attorney in fact; 
(3) this POWER OF ATTORNEY is terminated by court order; (4) the death of the child who is the 
subject of the power of attorney; or (5) the death of the grandparent designated as the attorney in fact. 

WARNING: DO NOT EXECUTE THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY IF ANY STATEMENT MADE IN 
THIS INSTRUMENT IS UNTRUE. FALSIFICATION IS A CRIME UNDER SECTION 2921.13 OF 
THE REVISED CODE, PUNISHABLE BY THE SANCTIONS UNDER CHAPTER 2929. OF THE 
REVISED CODE, INCLUDING A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT OF UP TO 6 MONTHS, A FINE OF 
UP TO $1,000, OR BOTH.

2.  You must include with the power of attorney the following information: 

(a)  The child's present address, the addresses of the places where the child has lived within 

the last five years, and the name and present address of each person with whom the child 
has lived during that period; 

(b)  Whether you have participated as a party, a witness, or in any other capacity in any other 
litigation, in this state or any other state, that concerned the allocation, between the 
parents of the same child, of parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the child 
and the designation of the residential parent and legal custodian of the child or that
