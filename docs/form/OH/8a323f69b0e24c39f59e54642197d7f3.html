      <pre>How to Apply for CLE Credit for Pro Bono Legal Services 

Effective January 1, 2014, attorneys may be eligible to receive CLE credit for providing certain 
types of pro bono legal services.  Pro bono programs that wish to seek pro bono credit for their 
volunteer attorneys should read Gov. Bar R. X, Sec. 5(H) and CCLE Reg. 415. 

Definition of “Pro Bono” CLE Credit 

The provision of legal services by a volunteer attorney to either a person of limited means or a 
charitable organization in which the legal service is assigned, verified, and reported to the 
Commission by any of the following: 

1.  An organization receiving funding for pro bono programs or services from the 

Legal Services Corporation or the Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation. 

2.  A metropolitan or county bar association. 
3.  The Ohio State Bar Association. 
4.  The Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation. 
5.  Any other organization recognized by the Commission as providing pro bono 

programs or services in Ohio. 

Eligibility for Accreditation 

Volunteer attorneys may not seek CLE credit for their pro bono legal services on their own.  
They must seek such credit through application with the pro bono sponsor, which is responsible 
for submitting CLE credits to the Commission.   

For purposes of CLE accreditation, recognized pro bono sponsors are deemed to be “sponsors” 
as defined in Gov. Bar R. X and the CLE Regulations and, to the extent applicable, are required 
to comply with all sponsor obligations as set forth in the rule and regulations, such as 
maintaining records of pro bono work engaged in by their volunteer attorneys, verifying attorney 
pro bono hours, and submitting attorney pro bono hours for CLE credit to the Commission. 

Process for Seeking CLE Credit for Volunteer Attorneys 

If the pro bono program needs to be recognized by the Commission as providing pro bono 
programs or services in Ohio (see, Gov. Bar R. X, Sec. 5(H)(5)), the program must first complete 
a Form 21.  If, after review of the Form 21, the program is recognized by the Commission, the 
program then should submit a Form 22 for accreditation of its specific pro bono program. 

Pro bono programs that wish to seek CLE credit for their volunteer attorneys must complete a 
Form 22 for submission to the Commission.  If the application is approved, the pro bono 
program will be provided with an Activity Code that the program will use to submit attorney 
attendance credits to the Commission.  The program approval will be for one calendar year.  Pro 
bono programs must resubmit a Form 22 for each year in which it seeks CLE credit for its 
attorneys. 

 

 

Reporting Pro Bono CLE Credit to the Commission 

Attorneys who wish to receive CLE Credit for their pro bono legal services should complete Part 
I of Form 23 for submission to the pro bono program.  The pro bono program should review the 
information provided by the attorney for completeness and accuracy.  After the sponsor has 
verified the information submitted by the attorney in Part I of Form 23, the sponsor should 
complete Part II of Form 23 to calculate the number of CLE Credit hours to which the attorney is 
entitled.  The pro bono program is responsible for submitting these credit hours to the CLE 
Commission through the Sponsor Portal.  Sponsors should retain the originals of Form 23 for 
two years. 

Calculation of CLE Credit 

Attorneys are eligible to receive one CLE credit hour for every six hours of pro bono legal 
services performed.  Pro bono programs are responsible for verifying the number of pro bono 
hours their volunteer attorneys have worked and dividing the total number of hours by six before 
submitting the CLE credit hours to the Commission.  An attorney must provide a minimum of 
six hours of pro bono legal services to be eligible to receive one hour of CLE credit.  After the 
minimum one-hour threshold has been met, additional pro bono hours will be rounded to the 
nearest quarter hour.  For example, if an attorney provides six hours of pro bono legal services, 
the attorney would receive one hour of CLE credit; if the attorney provides nine hours of pro 
bono legal services, the attorney would receive 1.5 hours of CLE credit; if the attorney provides 
ten hours of pro bono legal services, the attorney would receive 1.75 hours of CLE credit. 

Pro bono programs should submit CLE credit for their volunteer attorneys no later than thirty 
days following the end of the calendar year in which the pro bono services were performed. 

Forms for Applying for Pro Bono Credit 

Form 21, “Application to be Recognized as an Organization Providing Pro Bono Programs or 
Services in Ohio” 

Pro bono program providers should complete this form to be recognized by the Commission as 
an organization providing pro bono programs or services in Ohio pursuant to Gov. Bar R. X, Sec. 
5(H)(5). 

Form 22, “Application for Accreditation of Continuing Legal Education Activity: Pro Bono 
Credit” 

Pro bono program providers should use this form to seek CLE Credit from the Commission for 
their pro bono programs that will be the basis for CLE credit for their volunteer pro bono 
attorneys.  This form may only be submitted by a pro bono program to the Commission. 

 

 

 

 

Form 23, “Application for CLE Credit for Pro Bono Legal Services” 

Attorneys should complete Part I of this form to request CLE credit for the pro bono legal 
services they provided through a recognized pro bono program provider.  Attorneys should 
submit this form directly to the pro bono program through which the pro bono legal services 
were assigned; these forms should not be submitted to the CLE Commission.  Pro bono program 
providers should complete Part II of the form to calculate the number of hours of CLE credit to 
which a volunteer attorney may be entitled.  Pro bono programs should maintain these forms for 
at least two years.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
