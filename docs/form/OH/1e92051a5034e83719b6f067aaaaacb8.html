This guide for counsel presenting oral argument is prepared 
by the clerk of the Supreme Court of Ohio, and is designed 
to assist attorneys preparing cases for argument before the 
Court. It is not a substitute for the Rules of Practice of the 
Supreme Court, which are available on the Court’s website 
at supremecourt.ohio.gov under the clerk of the court’s page.

Who May Argue

Any attorney who plans to argue before the Supreme 
Court of Ohio must be on record as one of the attorneys 
for the party or amicus curiae that the attorney represents. 
If counsel is uncertain whether they have entered an 
appearance in the case, then counsel should check with 
the Office of the Clerk. Pursuant to Rule 2.01 of the Rules 
of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, only attorneys 
licensed to practice in Ohio and attorneys admitted pro hac 
vice are permitted to orally argue a case.

An amicus curiae that has filed 
a brief in a case is not entitled 
to participate in oral argument 
without leave of the Court. Leave 
may be sought by motion. This 
should be done well in advance 
of oral argument, but in any 
event, no later than seven days 
before the argument.

Any questions counsel 
may have about oral 
argument or about other 
case-related matters 
should be directed to the 
Office of the Clerk at 
614.387.9530.

Preparation

Counsel may find it helpful to attend a session of Court 
before the day scheduled for argument, or view a session 
on the Court’s website. Oral arguments are usually held 
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays throughout the year, though 
the Court typically schedules fewer arguments during the 
summer months. The schedule of arguments is posted on 
the Court’s website under the clerk of the court’s page. 

1

Arriving at Court

Between 8:30 and 8:45 a.m. on the day of argument, arguing 
counsel must report to the deputy clerk at the information 
desk outside the Courtroom on the first floor of the Thomas 
J. Moyer Ohio Judicial Center. Court convenes at 9 a.m. 
Counsel can verify the order of argument at that time, but 
should bear in mind that some cases conclude earlier than 
planned.

If counsel is sharing argument time, counsel must advise the 
deputy clerk about those arrangements and the amount of 
time that each attorney intends to present argument (see 
Managing Time, infra). 

The information desk on the first floor of the Court.

Counsel should advise the deputy clerk of any necessary 
accommodations that counsel or guests may need (e.g., a 
wheelchair or a hearing-assistance device). Court personnel 
can make suitable arrangements to meet the request.

After checking in, counsel may proceed to Room 103 
or Room 105 (Attorney Waiting Room), or enter the 
Courtroom and wait for their case to be called. Counsel may 
use personal computers and other electronic equipment 
in the waiting room. A live audio feed from the Courtroom 
allows attorneys in the waiting room to hear Courtroom 
proceedings as they occur.

2 

Courtroom Etiquette

Counsel presenting an argument before the Court.

Counsel should wear appropriate business attire befitting 
argument before the Court. Counsel also should be aware 
that all arguments at the Court are televised live on the 
Ohio Channel, a cable channel supported by Ohio’s public 
broadcasting stations, and are streamed live on the Court’s 
website.

Personal computers and other electronic devices, may be 
used at counsel table. However, counsel should take steps to 
ensure that those devices do not create any visual or audio 
disturbance. Cellular phones must be turned off in the 
Courtroom, and audible alarms on wristwatches should be 
muted.

When it is time for counsel to present argument, they should 
proceed to counsel table. Counsel for the appellant should 
sit at the counsel table to the left of the bench as one faces 
the bench. Counsel for the appellee should sit at the counsel 
table to the right of the bench as one faces the bench. 

Additional attorneys who are affiliated with counsel 
presenting argument also may be seated at each counsel 
table. Unless presenting argument, parties may not sit at 
counsel table.

3

While seated at counsel table, counsel should remove the 
visitor identification badge they were issued when entering 
the building. Upon leaving the table at the conclusion of 
argument, counsel should clip the badge to their clothing 
again until leaving the building.

When the chief justice calls upon counsel, they should 
proceed promptly to the attorney lectern. Once the 
chief justice has finished speaking, counsel may open 
with the usual acknowledgement:  
“Chief Justice _______ and may it please the court...”

Counsel should refer to the members of the Court 
this way:  
“Justice ______” or “Your Honor.”

Counsel should avoid referring to an opinion of the 
Court by saying: “In Justice ______’s opinion.” It is 
better to say:  
“In the Court’s opinion, written by Justice ______.”

Counsel should avoid emotional oration and loud, 
impassioned pleas. The Supreme Court is not a jury. A well-
reasoned and logical presentation should be the goal of 
those presenting argument.

In the end, the objective of these best practices is to 
contribute to a standard of practice for the defense of capital 
cases in Ohio that ensures constitutionally adequate legal 
representation for indigent persons facing the possible 
imposition or execution of a death sentence. At the same 
time, the goal of every practitioner must be to provide 
zealous representation that exceeds any minimal standard – 
the client and Ohio’s system of justice demands an attorney’s 
best efforts.

These best practices apply to any case in which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the prosecutor will contemplate 
seeking the death penalty, initially or via a superseding 
indictment. The prosecution decision to seek a capital 
indictment is oftentimes not apparent at the outset of a case 
(for example, either at the time of arrest or the issuance 
of a criminal complaint). Employing these best practices 

4 

at the onset of a potentially capital case may inform the 
prosecutor’s decision whether to seek a capital indictment 
and conserve judicial resources.

Nothing in these best practices diminishes counsel’s 
obligations to their clients in non-capital cases. 

Presenting an Effective Oral Argument

Counsel should assume that all of the justices have read 
the briefs filed in the case, including amicus curiae briefs. 
Ordinarily, counsel for the appellant need not recite the 
facts of the case before beginning argument. The facts are 
set out in the briefs and they have been read by the justices.

Argument should focus on the legal question or questions 
that the Court has agreed to review. Counsel should avoid 
deviating from them and avoid arguing about the facts.

Oral argument is a dynamic exchange of thoughts and 
information between counsel and the Court. To facilitate this 
exchange, counsel should refrain from reading argument 
from a prepared script.

In appropriate cases, counsel may suggest to the Court that 
bright-line rules should be adopted, and suggest what they 
should be. In many cases, the Court must craft a sound rule 
of law that not only will resolve the case, but also will guide 
judges and others in future cases.

Counsel should avoid using the “lingo” of a business or 
activity that is not widely understood. The Court may not be 
familiar with terms that are commonplace in a specialized 
area of practice. If necessary, counsel should explain 
unfamiliar terms so that the Court can more easily follow the 
argument and understand the points being made.

Counsel should be knowledgeable about what is and is not 
in the record in the case and should be familiar with the 
procedural history of the case. Justices frequently ask counsel 
if particular matters are in the record. It is helpful if counsel 
can provide the volume and page where the information is 
located. 

5

Counsel should avoid making assertions about issues or 
facts not in the record. If counsel is asked a question that 
will require reference to matters not in the record, then 
counsel should begin their answer by so stating, and proceed 
to respond to the question, unless advised otherwise by the 
justice.

Unless counsel has complied with Supreme Court Practice 
Rule 17.08, which allows one to file a list of additional 
authorities before oral argument, counsel should refer 
during argument only to cases or other authorities that are 
listed in the merit or reply briefs.

If counsel quotes from a document verbatim (e.g., a statute 
or ordinance), they should tell the Court where the text of 
the document can be read (e.g., “page ___ of the appellant’s 
brief”).

Counsel should know their client’s business. Justices may 
pose questions about how a product is made, how employees 
are hired, or how a relevant calculation was made. Counsel 
who anticipates those kinds of questions and comes 
prepared to answer them in clear and simple terms will help 
the Court better understand the case.

During argument, counsel should speak into the 
microphone so that their voice is audible to the justices and 
to ensure a clear recording.

Responding to Questions

Counsel should expect questions from the Court and make 
every effort to answer the questions directly. If possible, 
counsel should first respond either “yes” or “no,” and then 
expand on the answer. If counsel does not know the answer, 
an honest response is appreciated by the Court.

Counsel should avoid interrupting a justice when being 
addressed by the justice. Counsel should give full time and 
attention to the justice. If counsel is speaking when a justice 
interrupts, it is better to stop talking immediately and listen.

If a justice poses a hypothetical question, counsel should 
respond to the question in light of the facts stated in the 

6 

question. Counsel should avoid saying, “But those are not 
the facts in this case.” The justice posing the question is 
aware that there are different facts in the case, but wants 
and expects an answer to the hypothetical question. Counsel 
should attempt to answer the question, and, if necessary, may 
add an additional comment like: “However, the facts in this 
case are different,” or “The facts in the hypothetical question 
are not the facts in this case.”

A justice will often ask counsel: “Do any cases from this 
Court support your position?” Counsel should be careful to 
cite only those cases that support their position and avoid 
distorting the meaning of a precedent. If relying on a case 
that was announced by a plurality opinion, counsel should 
be sure to mention that there was no opinion of the Court in 
the case.

Managing Time

Counsel is not required to use all of the time allotted for 
argument. If counsel has emphasized and clarified the 
argument in the briefs and answered all of the Court’s 
questions, counsel may consider completing the argument 
before time has expired.

If counsel is sharing argument time pursuant to Supreme 
Court Practice Rules 17.05 and 17.06, counsel should inform 
the Court of the argument plan. For example, appellant’s 
counsel might say: “I will address the Fourth Amendment 
issue, and counsel for the amicus will argue the Fifth 
Amendment issues.” Counsel also should inform the deputy 
clerk of the intention to share time when checking in (see 
Arriving at Court, supra).

When counsel is sharing argument time with another 
attorney who represents a different party on the same side 
of the case, a red light will activate when the first attorney’s 
time has expired. For example, assume that there are two 
appellants, and each is represented by a different attorney. 
If the first attorney on the appellant’s side of the case has 
advised the deputy clerk that they will argue for five minutes, 
the red light will activate after five minutes have expired. 
That attorney must then sit down.

7

Each side has limited time to present their argument before the Court.

When the marshal activates the yellow light, counsel should 
be prepared to stop argument in two minutes. (The yellow 
light is used only for the last arguing attorney if two attorneys 
are sharing argument time.) The light signals that just two 
minutes remain of the total time allocated to your side of the 
case. (For example, if counsel has reserved three minutes 
for rebuttal, but the light comes on during the initial 
presentation of appellant’s argument, counsel has already 
used one minute of rebuttal time.)

If counsel for the appellant has planned for rebuttal 
argument, counsel should tell the chief justice at the start of 
the argument how many minutes they intend to reserve for 
rebuttal. 

During argument, counsel should not ask the chief justice 
how much time there is remaining. It is counsel’s obligation 
to keep track of time. Time is displayed on a digital clock on 
the attorney lectern. 

When the red light comes on, counsel should end argument 
immediately and either request the chief justice to permit 
the completion of a point or sit down. If counsel is answering 
a question from a justice, they may continue answering and 
respond to any additional questions from that justice or any 
other justice. In that situation, counsel need not worry that 
the red light is on. However, counsel should not continue 
argument after the red light comes on. 

8 

Once the chief justice announces that “the case is 
submitted,” counsel should promptly and quietly vacate the 
counsel tables in front of the bar.

The allotted time for argument is consumed quickly, 
especially when numerous questions come from the Court. 
Counsel should be prepared to skip over much of their 
planned argument and stress the strongest points.

Courtroom Participants

The justices enter the Courtroom through an entrance 
behind the bench. They sit in order of seniority with the 
chief justice in the middle, and the others alternating from 
left to right, ending with the most junior justice on the far 
right as one faces the bench.

The marshal sits at a desk to the left side as one faces the 
bench. The marshal calls the Court to order, maintains 
decorum in the Courtroom, and times the oral presentations 
so that attorneys do not exceed their time limitations.

The attorneys scheduled to argue cases are seated at the 
tables facing the bench. The arguing attorney will stand 
behind the lectern immediately in front of the chief justice. 

Opinions

The court may release an opinion at any time after an 
argument, though opinions usually are released to the 
parties, the public, and the news media on Tuesdays, 
Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 9 a.m. 

Opinions typically are available on the Court’s website as 
soon as they are announced.
