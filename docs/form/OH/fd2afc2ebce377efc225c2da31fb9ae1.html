      <pre>FORM 10.01-A:  GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
PROTECTION ORDERS 

DEFINITIONS YOU NEED TO KNOW 

Domestic violence is when a family or household member uses physical violence, threats, intimidation, 
and/or emotional, sexual, and economic abuse to maintain power and control over the other person, usually 
within an intimate relationship. Domestic violence is most often a combination of psychological and physical 
actions; the physical results are just the most visible. Domestic violence is a pattern of conduct in which one 
intimate partner uses force or threats of force to control the other person. 

 
State law has determined that some forms of abuse do not constitute criminal behavior or behavior requiring 
the Court’s intervention. For example, psychological battering, economic abuse, or verbal harassment without 
evidence of threats or physical harm are not recognized by Ohio law as domestic violence that allows a 
petitioner to obtain a protection order or request that criminal charges be filed. 

 
When a family or household member tries to cause you bodily harm by hitting, pushing, beating, or physically 
hurting you, that is domestic violence.  When a family or household member makes you afraid that you will be 
harmed, that is domestic violence.  When a family or household member stalks, commits sexually oriented 
offenses against you, or forces sexual relations on you, that is domestic violence.  When a family or 
household member abuses your children, that is domestic violence. 

IN A CIVIL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE: 

 

Petition for Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order (“CPO”) is the document a domestic violence 
victim, the victim’s parent, or an adult household member of the victim must file with the domestic relations 
court to obtain a civil protection order against an alleged offender.  

omestic Violence Civil Protection Order (“CPO”) Ex Parte is an emergency order the Court issues in 

response to the Petition for a Civil Protection Order after an ex parte hearing.  The ex parte hearing is 
described in this form on page 3. 

omestic Violence Civil Protection Order (“CPO”) Full Hearing is the final order the Court issues after 

a full hearing. The full hearing is described in this form on page 3. The full hearing CPO replaces the ex 
parte CPO.  Sometimes the final order issued by the Court is a Consent Agreement and Domestic 
Violence Civil Protection Order, Form 10.01-J, upon terms agreed to by the parties. 

etitioner is the person asking or “petitioning” the Court for protection.  By filing the Petition for a CPO, 

YOU are the Petitioner. 

espondent is the alleged domestic violence offender.  Petitioner seeks protection from the Respondent by 

N A CRIMINAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE: 

filing for a CPO. 

  I

Motion for a Criminal Domestic Violence Temporary Protection Order (“DVTPO”) is the document that 
must be filed in a criminal case if a victim of domestic violence or victim of a sexually oriented offense 
wishes to obtain a protection order against an alleged offender, who is a family or household member.  
The criminal case must allege the offender committed negligent assault, criminal damaging or endangering, 
criminal mischief, burglary, aggravated trespass, endangering children, any offense of violence, or any 
sexually oriented offense against a family or household member.  The prosecutor has a form for this 
purpose. 

omestic Violence Temporary Protection Order (“DVTPO”) is the order the Court issues in response to 
the Motion for Temporary Protection Order.  The DVTPO requires the offender to stop abusing and to stay 
away from the victims named in the Motion for Temporary Protection Order.  A DVTPO expires when the 
alleged offender’s criminal case ends or when a new CPO is issued based on the same facts. 

lleged Victim is the person asking the Court for protection in the Motion for a DVTPO.  

efendant is the person the Motion for a DVTPO is filed against.  The Defendant is the person accused of 
the crimes of negligent assault, criminal damaging or endangering, criminal mischief, burglary, aggravated 
trespass, endangering children, any sexually oriented offense, or any offense of violence against a family or 
household member.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CIVIL PROTECTION ORDERS (CPO) 

What is a Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order (“CPO”)? 

A CPO is issued by a domestic relations court to protect a victim of domestic violence.  A CPO is intended 
to prevent further domestic violence. It orders someone who has been abusive to do or not do certain 
things in the future.  You may want to consider getting a CPO even if you have a DVTPO from a criminal 
court because a CPO lasts longer and provides more benefits – such as child custody and support orders. 
Domestic violence includes the commission of sexually oriented offenses. 

iolating a CPO is a crime.  If the Respondent violates the CPO, he or she may be arrested, jailed, and 

fined for disobeying the CPO.  A CPO can remain in effect for up to 5 years.  If the Respondent violates the 
CPO, you can call the police, go back to the domestic relations court to file a contempt charge, and go to 
the prosecutor's office to have the Respondent charged with the crime of violating the CPO. 

hy get a Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order? 
If you are a victim of domestic violence, a CPO may help you.  Once domestic violence starts, the violence 
often happens more often and gets increasingly severe.  A CPO may stop this cycle of violence because the 
Court orders the Respondent to stop hurting or threatening you and your family or household members.  The 
Court can use a CPO to order the Respondent to stay away from you for up to five years.  A CPO can give 
you time to "sort things out" and decide what you want to do next without having to be afraid all of the time.  
If your children have seen domestic violence, a CPO may give all of you a chance to get some help so that 
you and your children are safe. 

omestic violence is a crime.  A CPO tells the Respondent you and the Court are serious about requiring the 

Respondent to stop his or her abusive behavior and not to hurt or threaten you again. 

 CPO sets some "rules" that the Respondent must obey while the CPO is in effect. These rules may require 
the Respondent to pay child or spousal support; give up possession of a home or car; and/or obey the Court’s 
orders about visitation. 

 CPO issued by a domestic relations court may last longer than a DVTPO issued by a criminal court and 
can provide more kinds of help.  You should know that if you get a CPO based upon the same facts as the 
DVTPO, the DVTPO from the criminal court will automatically end, even if the criminal case continues. 

 

Who can get a Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order? 

You can apply for a CPO if you are related to the Respondent by blood or marriage AND have lived with 
Respondent at any time; OR you are living with or have lived with the Respondent during the past five 
years; OR you used to be married to the Respondent; OR you have a child with the Respondent, whether 
or not you ever married or lived together.  

ou can also get a CPO for any member of your household. 

ou may be able to get a CPO if you have been dating the Respondent; if you share family or financial 

responsibilities with the Respondent; AND you have an intimate relationship with the Respondent. 

emember that a CPO has limits.  If you suspect that the Respondent will not obey the terms of a CPO, 
contact your local domestic violence program or the Ohio Domestic Violence Network at 800-934-9840. 

Do I need an attorney for me to obtain a Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order? 

No, but you are often better off having legal representation in your CPO proceeding.  Neither the Clerk of 
Court nor other Court employees can give you legal advice.  Having an attorney represent you is especially 
helpful when your case involves contested custody and visitation and/or when an attorney represents the 
Respondent.  If you cannot afford an attorney, contact your local legal aid office at 866-LAWOHIO (toll 
free), bar association, or Ohio State Legal Services (800-589-5888) for information on low cost or free legal 
representation.

[Page 3 of 3 Form 10.01-A] 
 

Must there be a court hearing for me to obtain a Domestic Violence Civil Protection Order? 
Yes.  There are two hearings involved in a CPO case:  the ex parte hearing and the full hearing. 

x Parte Hearing: At this hearing, only you are present.  The Respondent is not present.   

n ex parte hearing is held on the same day a Petition for Civil Protection Order is filed.  If a Petition for a 
CPO is filed early enough in the day, an ex parte hearing is held that same day.  At the ex parte hearing, 
you take an oath to tell the truth and a judge or magistrate hears your statement of what happened.  If the 
judge or magistrate finds that the events you described meet the requirements of the law, the Court will 
issue an Ex Parte CPO and schedule a full hearing.  If the Respondent is asked to vacate the home in 
which you live, there will be a full hearing within 7 business days.  Otherwise, a full hearing will be set within 
10 business days.  The Court can hold a full hearing only after the Respondent has been served with the 
Ex Parte CPO.  You may need to fill out forms for the Clerk of Court to cause service. 

ull Hearing:  The full hearing is the final hearing.  

t this hearing, both you and the Respondent can testify.  You must be present at the full hearing.  You 
should bring any witnesses and other evidence to support your case.  If the Court issues a Full Hearing 
CPO, it remains in force until the date indicated in the CPO, with 5 years being the maximum.   

f the Respondent does not show up for the full hearing, you can still obtain a final CPO.  However, if the 
Respondent is not served with the Ex Parte CPO before the full hearing, the Court postpones the full 
hearing until the Respondent is served.  If the full hearing is postponed, the Ex Parte CPO remains in effect 
until the full hearing is held. 

ou may bring an advocate with you to the ex parte and full hearings for support.  Some domestic violence 
shelters and victim assistance programs can provide advocates to go with you to these hearings.  Contact 
your local domestic violence program or the Ohio Domestic Violence Network, 800-934-9840, for program 
and shelter information. 

 

CRIMINAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TEMPORARY PROTECTION ORDERS (DVTPO) 

Your local criminal court grants a DVTPO.  You ask the Court for a DVTPO when a criminal complaint is filed 
alleging someone has committed domestic violence or a sexually oriented offense against you.  The DVTPO 
orders someone who has abused you to do or stop doing certain things in the future.  Violating a DVTPO is a 
crime.  If the Defendant violates the DVTPO, the Defendant may be arrested, jailed, and fined for disobeying 
the DVTPO.  Violating a DVTPO is also a reason for the Court to revoke the Defendant’s bail.  A DVTPO lasts 
only until the criminal case is ended or a CPO, based on the same facts, is issued by a domestic relations court. 
 

You can find information about Domestic Violence Civil Protection Orders in R.C. 3113.31 and information 
about Domestic Violence Temporary Protection Orders in R.C. 2919.26.
