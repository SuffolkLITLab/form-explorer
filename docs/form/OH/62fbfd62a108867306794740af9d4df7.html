      <pre>BEFORE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
 ON CHARACTER AND FITNESS 
OF THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO 

In the Matter of the Application of 

for Re-examination

RE-EXAMINATION 
CHARACTER 
QUESTIONNAIRE

EXPLANATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

Prior to completing this application for re-examination, you should read Rule I of the Supreme 

Court Rules for the Government of the Bar of Ohio. 

The information you provide in this application will update the information you provided in your last 
Ohio  bar examination  or re-examination application.  It will be considered confidential and may not be 
released except to the extent permitted in Gov. Bar R. I.   

Upon its receipt, your application will be forwarded to a regional or local bar association admissions 
committee  for  another  review  of  your  character,  fitness,  and  moral  qualifications  to  practice.    The 
admissions committee will make a recommendation as to your character, fitness, and moral qualifications. 
This recommendation will be considered by the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness.  You 
will  not  be  qualified  to  take  the  bar  examination for which  you  are  applying  unless  you  receive  Board 
approval  of  your  character,  fitness,  and  moral  qualifications  to  practice  at  least  three  weeks  before  the 
examination. 

You  must  answer  each  question  on  this  application  fully  and  truthfully.    Any  omission, 
untruthful answer or incomplete answer may result in your being denied the privilege of retaking the 
bar  examination  and  practicing  law  in  the  State  of  Ohio.    Question  5  “must  be  fully  answered 
regardless of expungements, bond forfeitures, dismissals or similar terminations and must include 
all actions or legal proceedings occurring in any court including juvenile court.”  In re  Application 
of Watson, 31 Ohio St. 3d 220, 221.  This includes any matter dismissed favorably to you, filed by you 
or in which you were involved in any manner other than as a witness. 

If you have doubts about whether any matter should be reported on this application, report it.  If you 
are  not  sure  of  dates,  times,  places,  or  other  information  requested,  you  should  consult  the  court, 
governmental agency, or other entity involved to obtain the correct and full information. 

If  your  application  is  incomplete  when  submitted,  it  will  not  be  accepted  and  you  will  be 

contacted to submit the deficient items. 

Your  responses  to  this  application  must  be  typed.    If  the  space  provided  for  any  answer  is 
inadequate,  or  if  you  are  providing  detailed  information  regarding  a  question  answered  in  the 
affirmative,  complete your  answer  on  a  separate  sheet,  specifying  the  question  to  which  it  relates,  and 
attach  this  sheet  to  the application.    Sign  your  name  on  each  additional  sheet  you  provide  with 
the  application.    The original  application must be signed under oath or affirmation.  

Completed  applications  are  to  be  filed  with  the  Supreme  Court Bar Admissions  Office  by  the  deadline 

imposed in Gov. Bar R. I, Sec. 7.  

After  your  re-examination  application  is  filed,  you  will  have  a  continuous  reporting  obligation  and 
must  notify  the  Bar  Admissions  Office  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  any  changes  or  additions  to  the  information 
provided in your application. 

Any  applicant  who  qualifies  for  testing  accommodations  under  the  Board  of  Bar  Examiners  Policy  on 
Applicants  with  Disabilities  may  file  a  Request  for  Testing  Accommodations.  The  Request  must  be  filed  with 
this application. 

If you have any questions regarding your application or any of the provisions of Rule I, please contact 
the  Bar  Admissions  Office  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio  at  614.387.9340  or  baradmissions@sc.ohio.gov.
