exceed the maximum per diem rates established by location within the continental United 
States as set by the Federal General Services Administration.  Reimbursement for meals 
and incidental expenses incurred when the travel does not involve an overnight stay is a 
taxable benefit pursuant to Internal Revenue Service regulations.

reimbursed for meals and incidental expenses incurred at the per diem rates established by

while traveling pursuant to Guideline 2.1. Reimbursement for lodging expenses shall be at 
actual  cost,  provided  the  cost  is  reasonable  as  determined  by  the  Director  of  Fiscal 
Resources.  Reasonableness in lodging expenses shall be based upon a determination the 
cost  is  similar  to  rates  by  other  commercial  establishments  at  the  time  the  travel 
arrangements are made. A judge shall be reimbursed for lodging expenses only when the 
judge incurs the expense more than forty-five miles from the judge’s residence, or more 
than thirty miles from the judge’s residence when the judge is attending a meeting of the 
Court  of  Appeals  Judges  Association  pursuant  to  division  (D)  of  Guideline  2.1  or  the 
annual meeting of the Ohio Judicial Conference pursuant to division (E) of Guideline 2.1.

and  shall  specifically  request  the  government  rate,  if  available,  and  exemption  from 
applicable taxes.

Fiscal Resources. 

(1) 
A judge shall submit an “Appellate Judges Expense Report” no later than sixty days 
after  the  travel  expense  was  incurred.    This  timeframe  may  be  extended  by  the 
Administrative Director of the Supreme Court if mitigating circumstances exist, but in no 
case may this time frame exceed ninety days after the last date of travel.  If the judge has 
received an advance payment for travel pursuant to Guideline 6.1, in which case the report

a request for reimbursement, except when a per-diem reimbursement is claimed. 

SECTION 6.0. 

ADVANCE PAYMENT FOR TRAVEL. 

.1. 

Procedure. 

A)  Requesting an advance 

   

A  judge  may  apply  for  and  receive  advance  payment  of  a  portion  of  the  estimated 
reimbursable  travel  expenses  the  judge  will  incur  for  travel  pursuant  to  Guideline  2.1 
involving an overnight stay of at least two consecutive nights.  To obtain a travel advance, 
the  judge  shall  complete  and  submit  to  the  Director  of  Fiscal  Resources  a  “Travel  and 
Conference Approval Form.”  The travel request shall include a reasonable estimate of the 
reimbursable travel expenses the judge will incur as a result of the travel. 

B) 

Payment of the advance 

Upon receipt of a completed and approved “Travel and Conference Approval Form,” the 
Director of Fiscal Resources shall arrange for payment of a travel advance to the judge and 
provide the judge with a copy of the form.  The amount of the travel advance payable to 
the judge shall not exceed eighty percent of the estimated reimbursable travel expenses to 
be incurred. 

C) 

Submission of travel expense report 

After returning from travel pursuant to Guideline 2.1, a judge shall complete and submit 
to the Director of Fiscal Resources an “Appellate Judges Expense Report” as required by 
Guideline 5.1.  Upon receipt of the report, the Director of Fiscal Resources shall reconcile 
the  report  with  the  “Travel  and  Conference  Approval  Form.”    If  the  sum  of  the 
reimbursable travel expenses exceeds the  amount of  the  travel advance, the Director of 
Fiscal Resources shall arrange for payment of the balance to the judge.  If the amount of 
the travel advance exceeds the sum of the reimbursable travel expenses, the Director of 
Fiscal Resources shall notify the judge of the amount due. 

D)  Repayment of excess advance 

A judge who is notified that the judge must repay a portion of the travel advance shall pay 
the balance within fifteen days of the date of receiving notice.  If the balance is not paid 
by the judge within fifteen days of receiving notice, the Director of Fiscal Resources, upon 
advance notice to the judge, may deduct the balance due from the judge’s compensation 
or other reimbursement earned by or payable to the judge.

has  a  balance  due  pursuant  to  division  (D)  of  this  guideline.    With  the  approval  of  the 
Administrative Director, the Director of Fiscal Resources may deny a travel advance to a 
judge  who  previously  has  failed  to  submit  timely  travel  expense  reports  as  required  by
