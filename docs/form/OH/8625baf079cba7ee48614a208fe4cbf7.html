DISCLAIMER 

Certifying  organizations  and  certified  attorneys  by  their  acceptance  of  accreditation  and  certification 
pursuant to such accreditation, expressly recognize and acknowledge that the Supreme Court of Ohio and 
the  Commission  on  Certification  of  Attorneys  as  Specialists  in  the  State  of  Ohio  do  not  and  shall  not  be 
construed to make any implied or expressed representation or warranty regarding the certifying process or 
the abilities of any attorney certified. 
39. Does your revocation process offer an appellate procedure to attorneys whose certification is revoked?
Responsibility, obligation, and liability in any way arising from the certifying process or the certification or
the failure of the integrity and ability of any attorney certified are expressly disclaimed by the Supreme Court 
of  Ohio  and  the  Commission  on  Certification  of  Attorneys  as  Specialists.    The  certifying  organization  and

Supreme  Court  of  Ohio  or  the  Commission  or  by  an  entity  other  than  the  certifying  organization.    A 
specialist  may  represent  that  the  certifying  organization  is  approved  by  the  Commission,  but  shall  not 
represent  that  the  certifying  organization  is  approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio.    Each  certifying 
organization  shall  include  this  disclaimer  as  an  integral  part  of  the  certification  granted  by  it  and  shall 
require  written  acceptance  thereof  as  a  condition  of  granting  certification  to  any  attorney  in  the  State  of

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
