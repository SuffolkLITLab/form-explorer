PRO SE CLINIC 
AGREEMENT FOR CLIENTS REPRESENTING THEMSELVES IN 
COURT 

This 

is  a 

training  agreement  between  __________________,  as 

trainer,  and 

__________________________ as student. 

The  trainer  agrees  to  provide  you  with  instructions  on  how  to  file  your  domestic 
relations case in the ________Court in ________ County, Ohio.  The instruction consists of a 
session with explanations on the divorce or dissolution  process or other custody or post decree 
legal action and course materials, including sample court documents and information sheets on 
related topics.   

ou  may  sign  up  for  an  individual  follow  up  appointment  to  have  documents  reviewed  for 
completeness  and  notarized  prior  to  filing  a  divorce  or  dissolution;  to  obtain  additional 
documents needed during the course of your pending case in court; for assistance in setting up 
hearing  dates  or  court  security,  and  to  discuss  resources  for  students  experiencing  domestic 
violence, threats, or other safety concerns before or after filing a divorce, dissolution, custody 
or post decree legal action. 

he  instructor  cannot  provide  legal  advise  during  group  or  individual  clinic  sessions.    Your 
spouse  or  the  person  whom  you  are  filing  against  may  have  participated  in  the  Clinic  in  the 
past or may do so in the future.  The instructor and other clinic staff are not your attorney and 
information you provide during group or individual appointments is not confidential.  

I understand that the purpose of this Clinic is instructional and educational, and is not 
intended as an agreement to retain legal services.  The relationship between the parties to this 
Agreement is that of a student and teacher, and is not that of attorney and client.  I understand 
that  the  trainer  is  not,  by  virtue  of  this  Agreement  or  the  services  provided  under  this 
Agreement serving as my attorney and is not representing me in any case before the Court that 
is now pending or may be filed in the future. 

I understand that the instruction and materials of this training relate to the practices and 
procedures of the _______ Court in  ________ County, Ohio  and may not be  appropriate for 
use in other courts in this State or any other State. 

I  agree  not  to  copy,  duplicate,  or  distribute  any  or  all  course  materials  for  the  use  or 

benefit of any other person. 

I understand that the Clinic strongly recommends that I seek the advice of an attorney 
prior to filing any legal action.   Self-representation may be especially detrimental to students 
facing any of the following circumstances: 
 

•  When there is a history of physical abuse, threats, coercion or intimidation by the other 

spouse/party or safety concerns; 

•  When you are pregnant or when custody of children is an issue; 
•  When you are seeking an annulment for religious or other reasons; 
•  When you are seeking a legal separation, but not a divorce;

  Y

  T

   

   

   

   

 

22 

•  When any of the following issues that may require additional court orders or documents 

need to be addressed: 

 Alimony (spousal support); 

o  Social security benefits if you have been married 10 or more years; 
o  Pension, retirement funds, 401k accounts or life or health insurance policies;  
o 
o  Real estate; 
o  Bankruptcy; 
o  Foreclosure; 
o 

 

•  When your spouse or the other party is represented by an attorney. 
•  When a child is born during the marriage and the husband is not the father. 
•  When you or your spouse are in the military. 

F  YOU  ARE  EXPERIENCING  ANY  OF  THE  ABOVE  ISSUES,  PLEASE  NOTIFY 
THE  INSTRUCTOR  AFTER  THE  CLASS.      IN  THESE  CIRCUMSTANCES,  IT  IS 
STRONGLY  RECOMMENDED  THAT  YOU  SEEK  THE  SERVICES  OF  AN 
ATTORNEY.    

I understand that if my divorce or other legal action becomes contested, the information 
given in this clinic will not prepare me to represent myself and I should seek the advise of an 
attorney. 

I  understand  that  I  can  schedule  additional  appointments  with  the  pro  se  clinic  and 
request  court  security  while  I  am  in  the  courthouse  if  I  have  concerns  for  my  safety  by 
contacting the _______ County Common Pleas Court at: ________ (phone number).  
 
 
I understand that I can talk to a domestic violence advocate to discuss safety planning, 
 
court  advocacy,  protection  orders  and  other  resources  that  may  be  available  to  me  if  I  have 
concerns for my safety by contacting ___________ (agency name) at ______________ (phone

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
