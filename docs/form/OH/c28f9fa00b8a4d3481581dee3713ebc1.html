I. Introduction
This guide is for anyone who wants to file with the 
Supreme Court of Ohio. The general information 
contained in this guide can help with the basic steps 
and procedures for filing with the Supreme Court. 

Even if you are not an attorney, you can represent 
yourself in cases before the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
You are strongly advised, however, to hire an attorney to 
represent you. 

An attorney will work hard to represent your interests 
and protect your legal rights. An attorney is obligated 
to give you objective legal advice. When representing a 
client in court, an attorney will put forward the client’s 
position in a way that complies with the rules of the 
court. As a negotiator, an attorney will work to obtain a 
result that benefits you and is consistent with the law. 

Some attorneys may accept a client on a pro bono, or 
free, basis. Bar associations and legal clinics throughout 
Ohio may provide you with the names of attorneys who 
can help with your appeal, including attorneys who are 
willing to accept pro bono clients. See Appendix A on 
p. 60 of this guide for a list of bar associations and legal 
clinics. 

For more information on the attorney-client 
relationship, see A Consumer’s Practical Guide to 
Managing a Relationship with a Lawyer available at 
www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/Publications/default.asp.

pro se
For one’s self. A person 
appearing pro se or 
filing pro se in a court 
is appearing or filing 
without the assistance 
of a licensed attorney. 

If you are not an 
attorney, you cannot 
represent anyone else 
or anything else, like a 
business you own. 

pro bo·no
From the Latin 
“pro bono publico,” 
meaning “for the 
public good.” Legal 
services performed pro 
bono are performed 
by a licensed 
attorney without 
any expectation of 
compensation. 

To learn more about 
the Ohio judicial 
system and the types 
of cases heard in each 
court, see Section VII 
of this guide, beginning 
on p. 43.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio2

Cases filed with the Supreme Court of Ohio must comply with the Rules of Practice 
of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Anyone filing in the Supreme Court must follow the 
deadlines, page limits, and other requirements in the rules.

A. Supreme Court of Ohio Rules of Practice

You must follow the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio if you file 
a case in the Supreme Court. The rules are available:

•  Online at www.supremecourt.ohio.gov.

•  By calling the Supreme Court of Ohio Office 
of the Clerk at 614.387.9530 and asking that a 
copy be mailed to you.

•  In the Supreme Court Law Library on the 
11th Floor of the Thomas J. Moyer Ohio 
Judicial Center at 65 South Front Street in 
Columbus.

This guide is not legal 
authority or a substitute 
for requirements found 
in the Supreme Court’s 
Rules of Practice.

B. Where and How to File

1. In Person or by Mail

You can file your documents in person or by mail with:

Office of the Clerk 
Supreme Court of Ohio 
65 South Front Street, 8th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio 43215-3431

2. E-Filing Portal

You can also file your documents electronically through the Supreme 
Court’s E-Filing Portal at: www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/Clerk/eFiling.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio3

C. What Type of Case Am I Filing?

There are many different case types that can be filed with the Supreme Court 
of Ohio, and each case type may have different filing requirements and 
deadlines. It is important to properly identify the type of case you need to file 
so that you meet all of the filing requirements and your case can be accepted 
for filing.

The following definitions may help you to determine the type of case you need 
to file with the Supreme Court. 

1. Jurisdictional Appeal

The majority of cases filed with the Supreme Court are jurisdictional 
appeals. If your case originated in a court of common pleas, a municipal 
court, or a county court, and you then appealed to a court of appeals, and 
you are now appealing to the Supreme Court, then you will probably be 
filing a jurisdictional appeal.

2. Appeal of Right

With the exception of an appeal involving the death penalty or the appeal 
of a contest of an election pursuant to R.C. 3515.15, a party does not have 
an appeal of right unless their case originated in the court of appeals. 
A case originates in the court of appeals only if a complaint for a writ of 
mandamus, prohibition, procedendo, quo warranto, or habeas corpus 
is filed initially with the court of appeals. If you are appealing from a 
court of appeals’ decision ruling on a complaint for a writ of mandamus, 
prohibition, procedendo, quo warranto, or habeas corpus that was initially 
filed with the court of appeals, then your appeal is an appeal of right.

3. Original Action 

If you are filing a complaint for a writ of mandamus, prohibition, 
procedendo, quo warranto, or habeas corpus for the first time with the 
Supreme Court of Ohio, then your case is considered an original action.

4. Administrative Agency Appeal

If you are appealing from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, Public 
Utilities Commission, or the Power Siting Board, then your case is 
considered an administrative agency appeal. 

5. Certified-Conflict Case

If the court of appeals issued an order certifying a conflict, your case is 
considered a certified-conflict case and is instituted by filing a notice of 
certified conflict. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio4

D. Filing Deadlines

The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk must receive your documents 
by 11:59:59 p.m., local observed time in Columbus, Ohio, on the day they are 
due. Please note that if you are filing in 
person, the Clerk’s Office is only open 
until 5:00 p.m., local observed time in 
Columbus, Ohio. Documents submitted 
through the E-Filing Portal on, or 
before, 11:59:59 p.m., local observed 
time in Columbus, Ohio, will be timely 
if they meet all the requirements of the 
Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court 
of Ohio.

E-Filed

If a document is mailed before the due date, but received by the Supreme 
Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk after the due date, then the document is late 
and cannot be filed. 

The same is true for amended and corrected documents. An amended or 
corrected document is due by 11:59:59 p.m. local observed time on the day the 
original document is due. 

Please note that the amended or corrected document must be re-filed in its 
entirety. You cannot submit only the amended or corrected portion or page. 

Appeals of right and jurisdictional appeals must 
be filed within 45 days of the date the court of 
appeals files its judgment entry with its clerk. 
Original actions filed with the Supreme Court 
generally do not have deadlines for filing. 

judg·ment en·try

in a case.

An appeal from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals must be filed within 
30 days of the decision being appealed. Appeals from the Public Utilities 
Commission and Power Siting Board must be filed within 60 days of the 
decision being appealed.

appealed.

Public Utilities Commission  
& Power Siting Board

Pay close attention to the deadline for filing an appeal. Missing the filing

appeal. Motions to extend the deadline for filing the notice of appeal are 
prohibited and cannot be filed.

It is important to remember that you must fully comply with the Rules 
of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. If you do not comply with 
the rules and your documents are returned to you, you must submit 
corrected documents within the original deadline or your appeal will not 
be accepted for filing.

is available on p. 6, 52-53, 55, and 57.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of OhioII. How To File, or Perfect, an Appeal
The court’s review of an appeal is limited to the 
record created in the trial court and the court of 
appeals. New information or evidence cannot be 
submitted to the Supreme Court and will not be 
considered by the court. 

The Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of 
Ohio refer to the act of properly filing an appeal as 
“perfecting” the appeal. For purposes of simplicity, 
this guide substitutes the word “file” for the legal 
term “perfect.”

To file an appeal in the Supreme Court,  
you must:

To submit the documents and

If your case is an appeal of right or 
an administrative agency appeal, 
a copy of the court of appeals 
judgment entry or the agency 
decision being appealed must be 
attached to your notice of appeal.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio9

A.  Types of Appeals

This guide covers the three types of appeals that can be filed at the 
Supreme Court: 

1.   Jurisdictional Appeal

ju·ris·dic·tion·al 
mem·o·ran·da  
(Rules 7.02 and 7.03)
Memorandum in support of 
jurisdiction and memorandum in 
response; documents that include 
arguments to convince the Supreme 
Court that it should either accept or 
decline an appeal.

A jurisdictional appeal is an appeal 
that claims to involve a substantial 
constitutional question involving 
either the U.S. or Ohio Constitution, 
an appeal that involves a felony or 
an appeal that involves a question 
of public or great general interest. 
With these cases, the Supreme 
Court exercises what is called its 
“discretionary jurisdiction,” meaning it can choose to accept the appeal 
or choose not to accept it. The Supreme Court will decide whether 
to accept a jurisdictional appeal after it reviews the jurisdictional 
memoranda, the court of appeals decision, and the court of appeals 
judgment entry. 

2.   Appeal of Right 

An appeal of right is an appeal from a court of appeals decision (or, an 
appeal “of” a court of appeals decision) in a case that began in the court 
of appeals.

3.   Administrative Agency Appeal 

An administrative agency appeal is an appeal from the Board of Tax 
Appeals, the Public Utilities Commission, or the Power Siting Board.

B. Notice of Appeal

You must file a notice of appeal with all types of appeals addressed in this 
guide. The notice of appeal must be filed within the number of days listed 
below based on the type of appeal you are filing. 

1.   Jurisdictional Appeal

The notice of appeal must be filed within 45 days of the date that the 
court of appeals filed its judgment entry with its clerk.

2.   Appeal of Right

The notice of appeal must be filed within 45 days of the date that the 
court of appeals filed its judgment entry with its clerk.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio10

3.   Administrative Agency Appeal

a.  Appeal from the Board of Tax Appeals.

The notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date of the entry of 
the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.

The following Board of Tax Appeals decisions can be appealed directly to 
the Supreme Court:

i.  A decision of the Board of Tax Appeals determining an appeal from 
a final determination by the tax commissioner or any preliminary, 
amended, or final tax assessment, reassessment, valuation, 
determination, finding, computation, or order made by the 
commissioner; or

ii.  A decision of the Board of Tax Appeals determining an appeal from a 
final determination of a local board of tax review created under R.C. 
718.11.

Appeals from all other decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals shall be taken 
to the court of appeals.

b.  Appeal from the Public Utilities Commission or Power Siting Board.

The notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days of the commission or 
board’s order.

Pay close attention to the deadline. Unless your case 
is an appeal of a felony conviction, missing the filing 
deadline will cause the Supreme Court to become 
divested of jurisdiction, meaning the Supreme 
Court will permanently lose authority to consider 
your appeal. 

di·vest·ed of 
ju·ris·dic·tion
No longer having authority 
to review a case.

See table on p. 11 for information that must be included in your notice of appeal. Like any 
document filed in the Supreme Court of Ohio, the notice of appeal also must 
comply with Rule 3.09, but can be neatly handwritten rather than typed if it is an 
emergency. 

When filing in person or regular mail, the original of any hard-copy 
document you file in the Supreme Court of Ohio must be in scan-
ready form, which means single-sided, not stapled or otherwise 
bound, and not containing dividers or tabs. The person filing a scan-
ready document is responsible for removing personally identifying 
information, such as Social Security numbers, bank account numbers 
and the names of juveniles. To identify such information, you should 
file a personal identifier form, available as Appendix B to this guide, 
and as Appendix B to the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court.

Affidavit of Indigence

Your affidavit of indigence cannot be 
older than six months and must be 
prepared before you submit it to the 
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of 
Ohio Office of the Clerk cannot provide 
notary services or otherwise help you 
prepare your affidavit. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio15

C.  Filing Fee

A $100 filing fee is required to file all appeals or original actions with the 
Supreme Court. 

You can pay the fee with cash; check or money order; or American Express, 
Discover, MasterCard, or VISA. Checks or money orders should be made 
payable to “Clerk, Supreme Court of Ohio” or “Supreme Court of Ohio.”

If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you can file your case by filing one of two 
documents:

1.  A copy of an entry from a court appointing counsel.

2.  A notarized affidavit of indigence (see sample, p. 14). 

To file an affidavit of indigence you 
can use Appendix C to this guide or 
Appendix A to the Supreme Court 
Rules of Practice.

To complete the affidavit of indigence 
form, write your name on the first line 
and the reasons you are unable to pay 
the fee in the blank space near the 
middle of the page. Sign the document 
in front of a notary public and have 
it notarized. An affidavit of indigence 
older than six months cannot be used. 

Does your affidavit of indigence 
include a notary public’s jurat?

The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of 
the Clerk cannot accept an affidavit 
without a jurat, or a statement by the 
notary that indicates the date the 
affidavit was sworn to, or affirmed, 
and signed in the notary public’s 
presence. The jurat must include the 
notary public’s signature and seal 
(see p. 14).

If you file paper documents and pay your filing fee by credit 
card, you also must submit a credit card filing fee form. The 
form is available as Appendix D to this guide and to the Rules 
of Practice of the Supreme Court.

your documents even if 
you file your case through 
the E-Filing Portal.

Do not submit a memorandum 
in support of jurisdiction when 
you submit a motion for delayed 
appeal. If the Supreme Court 
grants the motion for delayed 
appeal, it will issue an order 
that requires you to submit your 
memorandum in support of 
jurisdiction within 30 days.

The Supreme Court of Ohio 
Office of the Clerk cannot file 
your memorandum in support of 
jurisdiction unless the Supreme 
Court grants your motion for 
delayed appeal. You will receive 
a copy of the court’s decision 
on your motion by mail. You 
can also sign up for case activity 
notifications.

F.  Filing Fee

A $100 filing fee is required to file any type of appeal with the Supreme 
Court. 

You may pay the fee with cash; American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or 
VISA; or a check or money order made payable to “Clerk, Supreme Court 
of Ohio” or “Supreme Court of Ohio.” 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio23

If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you can file your case by filing one 
of two documents:

1.  A copy of an entry from a court appointing counsel to 

represent you.

2.  A notarized affidavit of indigence (see pp. 14 and 15). 

III.  How to file an Original Action

To initiate an original action you must file a 
complaint (or petition if you are filing for a 
writ of habeas corpus) that identifies which 
type or types of original action you are filing.

B. Complaint

You must file a complaint (or petition if filing for a writ of habeas corpus) in 
order to initiate an original action. The requirements for the complaint are 
listed below:

1.  Cover (Front) Page 
  The cover page must include:

a.  The nature of the proceeding – is it a mandamus, procedendo, 

prohibition, quo warranto, or habeas corpus case.

b.  Caption.
c.  The title of the document (i.e., complaint for procedendo). 
d.  The name, title, and address of all of the respondents in the case. 
The address of the respondents must be included and accurate 
because the Clerk’s Office will serve a copy of your complaint at 
the address that you provide for the respondents.

e.  Filing party or attorney’s name and address.

2.  Second Page

The second page (and additional pages as needed) of your complaint must 
include:

a.  Specific statements of fact that support your claim for relief.
b.  A statement of all the relief sought (i.e. tell the court what action 

you want the court to take).

3.  Affidavit in Support 

All original actions must have an affidavit in support attached to the 
complaint, or made part of the complaint. The affidavit must meet the 
following requirements:

a.  Specifically state the details of the claim.

b.  The affidavit in support must indicate 
that the facts were made on personal 
knowledge and show that the affiant is 
competent to testify to all matters stated 
in the affidavit. 

4.  Certificate of Service 

Aff·i·ant
The person swearing to 
the truth of the affidavit.

A certificate of service is not required for a complaint in an original action 
because the Clerk’s Office serves the complaint at the addresses listed for 
the respondents. 

If an amended complaint is filed, the party filing it must include a 
certificate of service and serve the respondents.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio26

C.  Filing Fee and Security Deposit

1.   Filing Fee 

A $100 filing fee is required to file all original actions with the

“Clerk, Supreme Court of Ohio” or “Supreme Court of Ohio.” 

2.   Security Deposit

Except in habeas corpus cases, a $100 security deposit is required to 
file all original actions with the Supreme Court. The security deposit 
is used for postage costs to serve the complaint by certified mail on 
the respondents. Any unused portion of the security deposit will be 
refunded to the person who initiated the case within 2 to 4 months 
after completion of the case. 

You may pay the security deposit with cash, American Express, 
Discover, MasterCard, or VISA; or a check or money order made 
payable to “Clerk, Supreme Court of Ohio” or “Supreme Court of 
Ohio.” 

Affidavit of Indigence

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee 
and security deposit to initiate an original 
action, you can file a case by submitting 
a notarized affidavit of indigence with the 
complaint (see pp. 14 and 15). 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio27

B. Commonly Filed Motions

1.   Motion for Stay

If you want an immediate stay of a court of appeals decision and are 
within the 45-day time frame for filing a new case, Rule 7.01(A)(3)permits 
you to file a notice of appeal and motion for immediate stay without a 
memorandum in support of jurisdiction before the 45th day.

Please note that your memorandum in support of jurisdiction is still 
required by the 45th day. In a jurisdictional appeal, the memorandum in 
support of jurisdiction must be filed within the original 45-day time period 
for filing the notice of appeal or the case will be dismissed. 

A motion for stay is not granted automatically. Relevant information 
regarding bond must be included in the motion. A copy of the court of 
appeals decision (judgment entry and opinion) must be attached to the 
motion for stay. There is no page limit for the motion for stay.

A motion for stay may be filed after the memorandum in support of 
jurisdiction is filed. 

2.  Motion for Reconsideration

If the Supreme Court issues a decision ending the case and you are not 
satisfied with the decision, you can file a motion for reconsideration 
within 10 days of the decision date (if the case is an expedited election 
case, the motion must be filed within three days of the decision date). No 
attachments are required and there is no page limit. The motion must 
explain to the court why it should reconsider its decision, but cannot re-
argue the case.

Appendix H to the Rules of 
 
Practice is a sample merit brief. 

 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of OhioV. Merit Briefs
You cannot file a merit brief unless your case is an appeal of right, an administrative 
agency appeal, or the Supreme Court accepts your appeal or issues an alternative writ in 
an original action. 

31

A. Appeals

Three merit briefs are usually filed: 

1. Appellant’s merit brief (filed first).

2. Appellee’s merit brief (filed second).

3. Appellant’s reply brief (filed last). 

1.  Appellant’s Merit Brief

a.  Fifty-page limit (the required cover 
page, table of contents, table of 
authorities cited, and certificate of 
service are not included in the page 
count).

b.  Due 40 days after the record is filed.
c.  The appellant’s merit brief must have 

attached:
i.  The court of appeals judgment 

entry and opinion being 
appealed.

ii.  Any other relevant decisions 

issued in the case.

You will receive a decision 
through the mail telling you 
if the Supreme Court has 
accepted or declined your 
appeal. If the court accepts 
your appeal, you will receive a 
notice of the date the record 
was filed. The deadline for your 
merit brief is computed from 
the date the record is filed, 
not from the date you receive 
the notice.

Does your appeal involve the 
termination of parental rights 
or adoption? If so, you have 
shorter deadlines for filing 
merit briefs. Please refer to 
the table on p. 6 as well as the 
timelines on pp. 52 & 53.

2.  Appellee’s Merit Brief

a.  Fifty-page limit (the required cover page, table of contents, table 
of authorities cited, and certificate of service are not included in 
the page count).

b.  Due 30 days after appellant’s merit brief is filed. 
c.  No required attachments.

3.   Appellant’s Reply Brief 

a.  Twenty-page limit (the required cover page, table of contents, 
table of authorities cited, and certificate of service are not 
included in the page count).

b.  Due 20 days after appellee’s merit brief is filed 
c.  No required attachments. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio32

B. Original Actions

If an alternative writ is issued, then evidence and merit briefs will be filed by all 
parties to the case. The alternative writ order will state the time for filing, but 
generally the order for filing is as follows:

1.  Evidence submitted by both relator and respondent(s).

2.  Relator’s merit brief (filed after the evidence).

3.  Respondent’s merit brief. 

4.  Relator’s reply brief. 

1. Evidence

The due date for the evidence will be set by the court’s alternative writ 
order. Permissible forms of evidence that may be filed are listed in S.Ct.
Prac.R. 12.06 and include:

a.  Agreed statement of facts (both parties agree to the facts in the 

document).

b.  Affidavits – made on personal knowledge.
c.  Depositions.
d.  Exhibits.
e.  Stipulations. 

2.  Relator’s Merit Brief

a.  Fifty-page limit (the required cover page, table of contents, table 
of authorities cited, and certificate of service are not included in 
the page count).

b.  Due date will be determined by the court’s alternative writ order.

3.  Respondent’s Merit Brief

a.  Fifty-page limit (the required cover page, table of contents, table 
of authorities cited, and certificate of service are not included in 
the page count).

b.  Due date will be determined by the court’s alternative writ order.

4.  Relator’s Reply Brief

a.  Twenty-page limit (the required cover page, table of contents, 
table of authorities cited, and certificate of service are not 
included in the page count).

b.  Due date will be determined by the court’s alternative writ order.
c.  A motion for leave to file rebuttal evidence may be filed within 

the time for filing the reply brief. The rebuttal evidence shall be 
attached to the motion.

VI. Affidavits of Disqualification
A party or an attorney may seek a judge’s removal from a case by filing an affidavit 
of disqualification with the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk. The filing 
requirements and relevant procedures are set forth in R.C. 2701.03 and S.Ct.Prac.R. 21.

A. How to file an Affidavit of Disqualification

1.  Affidavits shall be submitted to the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of 

the Clerk Office by:

Office of the Clerk 
Supreme Court of Ohio

When an affidavit of disqualification is submitted by mail and accepted for 
filing, the clerk’s office will mail a date-stamped copy back to the affiant or 
their counsel at the address listed in the affidavit. If the affidavit was not 
accepted for filing, a letter will be sent back with the unfiled affidavit stating 
the reasons for the rejection. A copy of the letter will be sent to the judge 
named in the affidavit.

When submitting the affidavits by mail or in person, the affiant must submit 
the original and three copies.

OR 

Email to: AOD_Filing@sc.ohio.gov. 

When an affidavit is filed by email, the affidavit shall be submitted as a .pdf 
attachment. You may upload more than 1 attachment, but the affidavit itself 
must be one .pdf. 

If the size of the document is large, you may send the .pdfs in more than one 
email. If you intend to send more than one email, please include the number 
of emails in the subject line, such as “1 of 2” “2 of 2.” 

Persons submitting an affidavit of disqualification by email will receive a 
responsive email from the clerk’s office stating whether the submission was 
filed or rejected. If the affidavit is not accepted for filing, the responsive email 
will list the reasons for the rejection. 

2.  The body of the affidavit shall not exceed fifteen numbered pages 

exclusive of the certificate of service and any exhibits. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio35

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of OhioVIII.  Ohio Judicial System

A.  The Supreme Court of Ohio

41

The Supreme Court of Ohio is established by Article IV, Section 1, of the Ohio 
Constitution, which provides that “the judicial power of the state is vested in 
a Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals, Courts of Common Pleas and divisions 
thereof, and such other courts inferior to the Supreme Court as may from time 
to time be established by law.”

Article IV, Section 2, of the Constitution sets the size of the court at seven – a 
chief justice and six justices – and outlines the jurisdiction of the court.

Supreme Court justices are elected to six-year terms in even-numbered years. 
They must have been admitted to the practice of law in Ohio six years before 
their terms begin.

The Supreme Court is the court of last resort in Ohio. Most of the cases it 
hears are appeals from the 12 Ohio district courts of appeals. In addition to 
the types of appeals discussed in this guide, the court hears appeals of cases 
involving the death penalty and cases in which there are conflicting opinions 
from two or more courts of appeals. The court also hears appeals from such 
administrative bodies as the state Board of Tax Appeals and the Public Utilities 
Commission.

The court has original jurisdiction for 
certain special remedies that permit a 
person to file an action in the Supreme 
Court. These extraordinary remedies 
include writs of habeas corpus (involving 
the release of those allegedly unlawfully imprisoned or committed), writs of 
mandamus and procedendo (ordering a public official to perform a required 
act), writs of prohibition (ordering a lower court to cease an unlawful act), and 
writs of quo warranto (against a person or corporation for usurpation, misuse, 
or abuse of public office or corporate office or franchise).

rem·e·dies
The enforcement of rights and 
redress of wrongs.

B. Courts of Appeals

The courts of appeals are established by Article IV, Section 1, of the Ohio 
Constitution and their jurisdiction is outlined in Article IV, Section 3. As the 
intermediate-level appellate courts, their primary function is to hear appeals 
from the common pleas, municipal, and county courts. Each case is heard and 
decided by a three-judge panel.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio42

The state is divided into 12 appellate districts, each of which is served by a 
court of appeals that sits in each of the counties in the district. The number of 
judges in each district depends on a variety of factors, including the district’s 
population and the court’s caseload. Each district has a minimum of three 
appellate judges. Appeals court judges are elected to six-year terms in even-
numbered years. They must have been admitted to the practice of law in Ohio 
six years before their terms begin.

In addition to their appellate jurisdiction, the courts of appeals have original 
jurisdiction, as does the Supreme Court, to hear applications for writs of 
habeas corpus, mandamus, procedendo, prohibition, and quo warranto. The 
Tenth District Court of Appeals in Franklin County also hears appeals from the 
Ohio Court of Claims.

C. Courts of Common Pleas

The court of common pleas is the only trial court created by the Ohio 
Constitution and its duties are outlined in Article IV, Section 4.

There is a court of common pleas in each of the 88 Ohio counties. The courts 
of common pleas have original jurisdiction in all criminal felony cases and 
original jurisdiction in all civil cases in which the amount in controversy is 
more than $15,000. Courts of common pleas have appellate jurisdiction over 
the decisions of some state administrative agencies.

D. Municipal and County Courts

Municipal and county courts were created by the General Assembly  
(see Ohio Revised Code Chapters 1901 and 1907). A county court is needed in 
an area of a county not served by a municipal court. Where a municipal court 
exercises county-wide jurisdiction, no county court is needed. 

The subject-matter jurisdiction of municipal and county courts is nearly 
identical. Both municipal and county courts have the authority to conduct 
preliminary hearings in felony cases and both have jurisdiction over traffic 
and non-traffic misdemeanors. These courts also have limited civil jurisdiction. 
Municipal and county courts may hear civil cases in which the amount of 
money in dispute does not exceed $15,000.

IX. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk has prepared these questions and 
answers to provide general information about filing cases in the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
This information is not a replacement for the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of 
Ohio. Attorneys and self-represented parties should always refer to the Rules of Practice 
for information that addresses their specific issues and circumstances. The information in 
the Rules of Practice takes precedence over the information in the FAQ. 

A. Filing an Appeal

What documents do I need to file to appeal a court of appeals decision to the 
Supreme Court? [Rules 6.01, 7.01 and 7.02] 

This depends on the type of appeal. To file a jurisdictional appeal, you must 
file a notice of appeal and a memorandum in support of jurisdiction. A copy 
of the court of appeals opinion and judgment entry being appealed must 
accompany your memorandum.

To file an appeal of right, you must file a notice of appeal. A copy of the 
judgment entry being appealed must be attached to your notice of appeal, but 
a memorandum in support of jurisdiction is not required in an appeal of right. 

When must the documents be filed? [Rule 6.01 and 7.01] 

Documents required to file a jurisdictional appeal, a claimed appeal of right, 
or an appeal of right are due no later than 45 days after the entry of the 
judgment being appealed.

Is there a fee for filing an appeal? [Rules 3.04 and 3.06]

Yes. A $100 filing fee is required by statute and Supreme Court rule for filing 
an appeal. You can pay the fee with cash; check or money order; or American 
Express, Discover, MasterCard, or VISA. Checks or money orders should be 
made payable to “Clerk, Supreme Court of Ohio” or “Supreme Court of Ohio.” 
To file your appeal without the fee, you can file an entry appointing counsel 
or an affidavit of indigence that complies with the Supreme Court Rules of 
Practice. The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk cannot file an appeal 
without the required fee, entry appointing counsel, or affidavit of indigence.

Can I get an extension of time to file my notice of appeal and memorandum in 
support of jurisdiction? [Rule 7.01(A)(1)(b)]

No. The time period for filing a notice of appeal and memorandum in support 
of jurisdiction is mandatory. If you do not file your appeal within the 45-day 
time period, the Supreme Court will lose jurisdiction over your appeal. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio45

Are there any exceptions to the 45-day time period? [Rule 7.01(A)(4)]

The Supreme Court Rules of Practice provide one very limited exception to 
this general rule. If you are appealing a felony decision after the time for filing 
a notice of appeal and memorandum in support of jurisdiction has passed, 
the Rules of Practice permit you to file a notice of appeal with a motion for 
delayed appeal. This exception does not apply to postconviction cases or to 
applications filed under Rule 26(B) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure (also 
called Murnahan appeals). 

I received a copy of a notice of appeal and memorandum in support of 
jurisdiction from an attorney for another party, but neither document is file-
stamped. How can I find out the Supreme Court case number and when my 
memorandum in response is due?

To determine the Supreme Court case number assigned to a notice of appeal 
and memorandum in support, and when the 
documents were filed, you can access the 
court’s online docket through its website: 
supremecourt.ohio.gov/clerk.

scan rea·dy  
(Rule 3.09(B)(2)(b))
Single-sided, not stapled or 
otherwise bound, and not 
containing dividers or tabs. 

After accessing the link for the online 
docket, use the case name or the court of 
appeals case number to search the docket 
and determine if the appeal has been 
filed. If the appeal has been filed, search 
results will indicate the Supreme Court 
case number that has been assigned to 
the case. After you find out when the case 
was filed, you can calculate the date your 
memorandum in response is due.

The person filing a scan-ready 
document is responsible for 
removing personally identifying 
information, such as Social 
Security numbers, bank account 
numbers, and the names of 
juveniles (Rule 3.12(B)(1)). A 
personal identifier form is 
available as Appendix B to this 
guide and as Appendix B to 
the Rules of Practice of the 
Supreme Court. 

You can access the online case docket to 
determine the filing date of any pleading 
or other document served on you, and then 
calculate the due date for any responsive 
document. Note that the date a document is 
filed in the Supreme Court frequently is different 
from the date it is received by you. The only date 
you should use to calculate the time for 
filing your response, however, is the filing date indicated by the court’s online 
docket.

If you do not have access to the Internet, a Supreme Court deputy clerk can 
access the online docket for you. You can reach a deputy clerk at 614.387.9530. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio46

After an appeal is filed, when will the Supreme Court reach a decision on 
accepting the the appeal?

Generally, the court announces its decision to accept or decline an appeal 
three to six months after the memorandum in response is filed. 

If the appeal involves termination of parental rights or adoption of a minor 
child, or both, the Supreme Court will expedite its review and determination.

B. General Filing Issues

How do I file documents with the Supreme Court? [Rule 3.02(A)]

The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk is open for filing from 8 
a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Documents filed in person must be 
received by 5 p.m. local observed time in Columbus, Ohio, to be filed as of 
the date received. The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk is closed 
on weekends, on all state holidays, except Columbus Day, and on the day after 
Thanksgiving.

E-filed documents must be submitted before 11:59:59 p.m. local observed time 
on the date the documents are due, but documents submitted after 5 p.m. will 
not be reviewed until the next business day. 

What are the business hours of the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the 
Clerk? [Rule 3.02(A)]

The Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk is open for filing from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Documents must be received by 5 p.m. local 
observed time in Columbus, Ohio, to be filed as of the date received. This rule 
applies to documents that are paper filed. The Supreme Court of Ohio Office 
of the Clerk is closed on weekends, on all state holidays, except Columbus Day, 
and on the day after Thanksgiving.

To access the Supreme Court business floors, you must present valid 
photo identification and pass through the Moyer Judicial Center’s security 
checkpoint. Please keep this in mind when calculating the time you need to 
reach the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk, which is on the 8th 
Floor of the Moyer Judicial Center, before the close of business.

What if my filing deadline falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, a holiday or the 
day after Thanksgiving? When should I file to make sure my document is 
considered timely? [Rule 3.03(A)(1)]

If the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk is closed on the day your 
document is due, your document is due on the next business day the office is 
open. 

The same is true if the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk closes early 
for some reason on the day your document is due. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio47

Supreme Court Holidays

New Year’s Day: January 1

Martin Luther King Jr. Day: 
Third Monday in January

Presidents Day: 
Third Monday in February

Memorial Day:  
Last Monday in May

Juneteenth: June 19

Independence Day: July 4

Labor Day:  
First Monday in September

Veterans Day: November 11

Thanksgiving Day: 
Fourth Thursday in November

Day after Thanksgiving

Christmas: December 25

For example, if your filing deadline falls 
on Saturday, your document would be due 
Monday. If Monday is a state holiday, then 
your document would be due Tuesday.

Even though the Supreme Court of Ohio 
Office of the Clerk is open on Columbus 
Day, that day is considered a legal holiday 
for purposes of determining filing deadlines; 
therefore, documents that are due on 
Columbus Day are considered on time if 
filed the following day. Similarly, filings that 
fall due on the day after Thanksgiving, a day 
the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the 
Clerk is closed, are considered timely if filed 
the following Monday. 

If I submit a document for filing by mail, is 
it considered filed with the Supreme Court 
when it is mailed? [Rule 3.02(A)(4)]

No. Documents, submitted by mail or some 
other delivery service, are not considered 
filed until they are received in the Supreme 
Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk and 
accepted for filing. Therefore, if you submit 
documents by mail, you should send them 
far enough in advance of the due date so 
they arrive by the due date.

If your filing deadline falls 
on Columbus Day or on the 
day after Thanksgiving, your 
documents are due on the 
following business day.

Note that a delivery confirmation indicating final 
delivery from the U.S. Postal Service or any other 
delivery service does not necessarily mean your 
package is in the Supreme Court of Ohio Office 
of the Clerk and does not mean your documents 
were received and accepted for filing by the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk. 
To confirm the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk has received your 
package, or to confirm that your documents have been filed, call 614.387.9530 
and ask to speak to a deputy clerk.

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio48

Do I get three extra days to file if I am 
responding to a document that was served 
on me, or that I received, by mail?

No. The Supreme Court Rules of Practice 
do not provide additional time to respond 
to documents served by mail.

The federal 3-day mail rule 
does not apply in the Supreme 
Court of Ohio.

Where do I mail my filings?

Documents submitted by mail for filing with the Supreme Court of Ohio 
should be addressed directly to:

Office of the Clerk 
Supreme Court of Ohio 
65 South Front Street, 8th Floor 
Columbus, Ohio 43215-3431

Are extensions of filing deadlines ever allowed? [Rule 3.03(B)]

The Supreme Court Rules of Practice allow for an extension of time for filing a 
merit brief, including a reply brief, and the response to a complaint. 

You can get an extension of up to 20 days for filing a merit brief by agreement 
with the other side by filing a written stipulation to the extension that complies 
with the Supreme Court Rules of Practice. If you cannot agree to a 20-day 
extension with the other side, you can file a request for an extension of up to 
10 days. 

A stipulation to or request for an extension of time must be filed no later than 
the deadline for filing the brief that is the subject of the extension. A party is 
permitted only one extension of time in a case. 

What will happen if the document I want to file is submitted late?  
[Rules 3.02(B) and (C), 12.06(B), and 12.08(A)(2)(d)]

The Supreme Court Rules of Practice strictly prohibit late filings. The 
Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk is required to reject any document 
received after the filing deadline. Motions to file “instanter” or “out of rule” 
also are prohibited. If you submit a document that is not accepted for filing by 
the Supreme Court of Ohio Office of the Clerk, you must notify all parties you 
served with the document that the document was not filed.

The Rules of Practice permit the filing of a motion for leave to file rebuttal 
evidence within the time for filing a reply brief in original actions.

How should documents be bound? [Rule 3.09(B)(2)(b) and 3.10(D)]

The original of any document being filed should be scan-ready, or single-sided, 
not stapled or otherwise bound, and not containing dividers or tabs. 

A Guide to Filing in The Supreme Court of Ohio49

Copies must be firmly stapled or bound on the left margin, but the Supreme 
Court Rules of Practice do not require a specific binding method. Plastic cover 
pages are prohibited, but you can use a plastic spiral binding if staples will not 
penetrate your document completely. Any document that is thicker than two 
inches must be bound in two or more numbered volumes.

The Supreme Court Rules of Practice place page limitations on jurisdictional 
memoranda and merit briefs. Do these page limitations cover the table of

assist people with cases before the Supreme Court, including:

“of” a court of appeals decision)

expect from an attorney and what is expected of you. An attorney may or may not agree 
to represent you in this matter.

You should be prepared to pay for the services performed by an attorney. Depending on 
your income, you may qualify for legal aid. To contact an Ohio civil legal aid provider, 
call 1-866-LAW-OHIO (1-866-529-6446).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
