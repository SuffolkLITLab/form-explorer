      <pre>BEFORE THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 
ON CHARACTER AND FITNESS 
OF THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO 

In the Matter of the Application of 

to Take the Bar Examination

APPLICANT’S SUPPLEMENTAL         
CHARACTER QUESTIONNAIRE 

EXPLANATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 

Prior to filing your Application to Take the Bar Examination, you should have filed an  Application to Register as 
a  Candidate  for  Admission  to  the  Practice  of  Law  in  Ohio  (“Registration  Application”).  As  part  of  that 
application,  you  submitted  a  completed  Character  Questionnaire.    The  filing  of  that  Character  Questionnaire 
triggered the process by which your character, fitness, and moral qualifications to practice law were reviewed.   

This Supplemental Character Questionnaire is required by Gov. Bar R. I, Sec. 3, as a final step in the character 
and  fitness  review  process.    The  information  you  provide  in  the  Supplemental  Character  Questionnaire  will  update 
the information you provided earlier in the Character Questionnaire you filed with your Registration Application.  It 
will be considered confidential and may not be released except to the extent permitted in Gov. Bar R. I.   

Pursuant  to  Gov.  Bar  R.  I,  Sec.  3,  Div.  (C),  your  completed  Supplemental  Character  Questionnaire  will  be 
forwarded  to  a  regional  or  local  bar  association  admissions  committee  for  review.    If  appropriate  or  necessary,  the 
admissions  committee  may  conduct  further  investigation  or  request  a  personal  interview.    After  the  admissions 
committee completes its supplemental character and fitness review, it will make a final recommendation as to your 
character, fitness, and moral qualifications. 

The Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness will consider and act upon the admissions committee’s 
recommendation.   You  must receive final Board approval of your character, fitness, and moral qualifications at least 
three weeks prior to the examination you are applying to take.  If you receive timely final approval from the Board, a 
notice  of  final  approval  will  be  sent  to  you,  along  with  your  bar  examination  instructions,  approximately  two 
weeks  before  the  examination.    Unless  and  until  you  receive  final  approval  of  your  character,  fitness,  and  moral 
qualifications to practice, you may not take the Ohio bar examination. 

You must  answer each question  on this questionnaire fully and truthfully.  Any omission,  untruthful 
answer  or  incomplete  answer  may  result  in  your  being  denied  the  privilege  of  taking  the  bar  examination 
and  practicing  law  in  the  State  of  Ohio.    Question  6  “must  be  fully  answered  regardless  of  expungements, 
bond  forfeitures,  dismissals  or  similar  terminations  and  must  include  all  actions  or  legal  proceedings 
occurring  in  any  court  including  juvenile  court.”    In  re  Application  of  Watson  (1987),  31  Ohio  St.  3d  220, 
221.  This includes any matter dismissed favorably to you, filed by you or in which you were involved in any 
manner other than as a witness.

If you have any doubts about whether any matter should be reported on this questionnaire, report it.   If you 
are  not  sure  of  dates,  times,  places,  or  other  information  requested,  you  should  consult  the  court,  governmental 
agency, or other entity involved to obtain the correct and full information. 

Your responses to this application must be typed.  If the space provided for any answer is inadequate, or if 
you are providing detailed information regarding a question answered in the affirmative, complete your answer on a 
separate  sheet,  specifying  the  question  to  which  it  relates,  and  attach  this  sheet  to  the  application.    Sign  your 
name  on  each  additional  sheet  you  provide  with  the  application.    The  original  application  must  be  signed  under 
oath or affirmation.  

Completed  applications  are  to  be  filed  with  the  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio  Bar  Admissions  Office  by  the 

deadline imposed in Gov. Bar R. I, Sec. 7. If your application is incomplete when submitted, it will not be accepted and 
you will be contacted to submit the deficient items. 

After  your  application  is  filed,  you  will  have  a  continuous  reporting  obligation  and  must  notify  the  Bar 
Admissions Office of the Supreme Court of any changes or additions to the information provided in your application. 

Completed  applications  are  to  be  filed  with  the  Supreme  Court  Bar  Admissions  Office  by  the  deadline

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
