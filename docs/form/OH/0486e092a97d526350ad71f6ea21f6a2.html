ESTATE OF: _______________________________________________________________ 

CASE NO. _____________________ 

SUMMARY OF GENERAL RIGHTS OF SURVIVING SPOUSE 
[R.C. 2106.02] – Date of Death After April 5, 2017 

To: _______________________________ 

Surviving Spouse 

_______________________________ 
Address
_______________________________ 
City, State, Zip Code 

This is a summary of your general rights as surviving spouse under Chapter 2106 of the Revised Code. 
Many of these rights have specific time limits in which they must be exercised.  If you have questions 
concerning  your  rights,  you  should  discuss  them  with  an  attorney  of  your  choice.    The  Court  cannot 
advise you.  

1.

Election to Take Under or Against the Will (R.C. 2106.01 - 2106.08)

If you elect to take against the Will, you are entitled to one-half of the decedent’s net estate, unless there are two 
or more of the decedent’s children or their lineal descendants surviving, in which case you are entitled to one-third 
of the decedent’s net estate. You will not be entitled to receive any assets given to you under the Will.  

If you elect to take under the Will, you will receive those assets given to you under the Will. 

Whichever choice you make, (unless you elect to take under the Will and the Will specifically precludes you from 
exercising these rights), you will not be barred from your rights to purchase certain assets at the appraised value, 
to remain in the mansion house (the residence) for one year, to receive an allowance for support, to receive  one 
or more  automobiles not to exceed an aggregate value of $65,000 and one watercraft and one outboard motor 
owned by the decedent, and  such  rights as a surviving spouse may be entitled under law. 

Although  your election may not affect certain non-probate property, such as joint and survivorship, payable on 
death, and transfer on death property, it may  have an effect on other types of non-probate  property, including 
property held in trust. 

Before making your election, you are entitled to file a complaint in this Court asking that the Will be construed. 

If you elect to take under the Will, you may do so in writing if you wish, but you may also do so by taking no action. 

If you elect to take against the Will, you must do so in person before the Probate Judge or a Magistrate.  This 
election  must  be  exercised  within  five  months  from  the  date  of  the  initial  appointment  of  the  administrator  or 
executor of the estate or it is forfeited. 

2.

Right to Receive Mansion House (R.C. 2106.10)

Depending upon the value of the real estate, you may have the right to receive the mansion house (the residence) 
as part of your inheritance. 

3.

Right to Place Charge on Real Estate (R.C. 2106.11)

If there is no Will and there are insufficient assets to pay the specific monetary share due to the surviving spouse 
pursuant to R.C. 2106.05, you have the right to place a charge (lien) on any real property included in the probate 
estate in the amount of the unpaid portion of the specific monetary share.  

FORM 8.3 – SUMMARY OF GENERAL RIGHTS OF SURVIVING SPOUSE 

Effective Date: October 1, 2020

[Page 2 of 2 Form 8.3] 

 

CASE NO. ___________________ 

Allowance for Support (R.C. 2106.13) 

ou  may  be  entitled  to  an  allowance  for  support.    For  deaths  occurring  after  March  18,  1999,  the  amount  is 
$40,000 of probate assets.  If there are one or more minor children of the decedent, not the children of the surviving 
spouse, this Court will apportion the allowance among those children and the surviving spouse.  

Right to Remain in the Mansion House (R.C. 2106.15) 

ou have the right to remain in the mansion house (the residence), if it is a probate asset, for a period of one year 
from the date of death without the payment of rent to the estate.  If the mansion house is sold to pay debts during 
this  period  of  time,  you  may  be  entitled  to  the  fair  rental  value  of  the  mansion  house.    This  election  must  be 
exercised within five months from the initial appointment of the administrator or executor or the right is forfeited. 

. 

Right to Purchase Property (R.C. 2106.16) 

ou have the right to purchase assets of the probate estate at the appraised values.  The application or petition 

to purchase the assets must be filed within one month of the approval of the inventory or the right is forfeited. 

. 

Right to Automobiles (R.C. 2106.18) 

ou may be entitled to receive one or more automobiles, not specifically bequeathed, that would otherwise be 
included in the probate estate and do not exceed an aggregate value of $65,000.  This election may affect the 
amount you may receive under the Allowance for Support.  This election must be exercised within five months 
from the initial appointment of the administrator or executor or the right is forfeited. 

Right to Watercraft and Outboard Motor (R.C. 2106.19) 

ou  may  be  entitled  to  receive  one  watercraft,  one  watercraft  trailer,  and  one  outboard  motor,  not  specifically 
bequeathed, that would otherwise be included in the probate estate.  This election must be exercised within five 
months from the initial appointment of the administrator or executor or the right is forfeited. 

. 

Right to Reimbursement of Funeral Bill (R.C. 2106.20) 

ou may be entitled to be reimbursed for the payment of the funeral bill. If the estate is insolvent, you will receive 

the same statutory priority as granted to the funeral and burial expenses. 

0. 

Right to Challenge Antenuptial or Separation Agreement (R.C. 2106.22) 

ou are entitled to file an action to contest the validity  of an antenuptial or separation agreement.  This action 

must be filed within four months after the appointment of the executor or administrator or the right is forfeited.  

his is a summary of your general rights.  There may be additional rights to which you are entitled.  

hio Revised Code § 2106.25 states: 

nless otherwise specified by a provision of the Revised Code or this section, a surviving spouse shall exercise 
all rights under Chapter 2106 of the Revised Code within five months of the initial appointment of an executor or 
administrator of the estate.  It is conclusively presumed that a surviving spouse has waived any right not exercised 
within  that  five-month  period  or  within  any  longer  period  of  time  allowed  by  the  court  pursuant  to  this  section.  
Upon the filing of a motion to extend the time for exercising a right under Chapter 2106 of the Revised Code and 
for good cause shown, the court may allow further time for exercising the right that is the subject of the motion.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
