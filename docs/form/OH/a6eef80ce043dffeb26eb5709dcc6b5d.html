PREFACE 
_____________________________________________________ 

omposed under the direction of the Supreme Court of Ohio Style Manual Committee at 
the  request  of  the  late  Chief  Justice  Thomas  J.  Moyer,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio 
Writing Manual is the first comprehensive guide to judicial opinion writing published by 
the court for its use.  The Supreme Court will follow this manual in its opinions.  
  
Consisting of three parts, the Writing Manual addresses broad areas of interest to judges 
and lawyers. 

art  I,  the  Manual  of  Citations,  governs  the  citation  format  used  in  Supreme  Court 
opinions and other opinions. It sets forth rules for the forms of citation for cases, statutes, 
and  other  sources,  provides  examples  for  each  category,  and  explains  the  use  of 
WebCites. 

art  II,  the  Style  Guide,  provides  direction  on  certain  aspects  of  style  used  in  Supreme 
Court opinions. Subjects covered include capitalization, punctuation, use of footnotes and 
headings, captions, and commonly misused words. 

art III, the Structure of a Judicial Opinion, is a guide intended to assist writers of judicial 
opinions.  It  offers  an  outline  setting  forth  the  basic  components  of  an  opinion  in  the 
traditional sequence, followed by several examples written in the Supreme Court style.  

lthough Ohio judges and lawyers are not required to follow this manual, the committee 

hopes that it will be useful in writing opinions and drafting briefs and pleadings.

INTRODUCTION TO THE MANUAL OF CITATIONS 
_____________________________________________________ 

 

 

The Manual of the Forms of Citation Used in the Ohio Official Reports, a forerunner of 
the Writing Manual, first appeared in January 1985. Its purpose was to make uniform the 
forms of citation used in opinions published in the Ohio Official Reports. In July 1992, an 
interim  edition  was  released,  followed  in  July  2002  by  the  Revisions  to  the  Manual  of 
Citations. The 2002 version brought the manual into compliance with the revised Rules 
for Reporting Opinions adopted by the Supreme Court effective May 1, 2002.  

he  2012  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio  Writing  Manual,  updated  in  2013  with  this  second 
edition, supersedes the 1985 manual, the interim edition, and the 2002 revisions. Unlike 
previous  versions,  the  Writing  Manual  states  its  directives  in  rule  format.  Part  I,  the 
Manual of Citations, is divided into six sections (“Cases,” “Constitutions,” “Statutes and 
Ordinances,”  “Rules  and  Regulations,”  “Secondary  Sources,”  and  “Miscellaneous 
Citation  Rules”),  and  each  section  contains  divisions.  Part  II  of  the  manual,  the  Style 
Guide, provides guidance in matters of style. Part III, Structure of a Judicial Opinion, is 
offered as an aid to drafters of opinions. 

he Manual of Citations contains several changes to citation style. The most notable are: 

decision; 

C.A.6; 

and county of decision; 

•  The date of a judicial opinion now appears at the end of the citation; 
•  Citations  of  print  published  appellate  cases  now  identify  the  district  of 

•  Citations of non-print published appellate cases now identify both the district 

•  The  federal  circuits  are  now  identified  using  “Cir.,”  e.g.,  6th  Cir.  instead  of 

•  Federal statutes are now cited using “U.S.C.,” e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1982 instead of 

•  Ohio  case  citations  no  longer  include  Ohio  Bar  Reports  (OBR)  or  Ohio 

Section 1982, Title 42, U.S.Code; 

Opinions (O.O., O.O.2d, O.O.3d); 

•  Signals are now italicized.

.1.  Ohio Court Cases. 

Importance of May 1, 2002 

eginning on May 1, 2002, the Supreme Court’s website became the repository of 
all opinions of the Supreme Court, the courts of appeals, and the Court of Claims, 
as well as selected opinions of the state’s other trial courts. Since that time, each 
opinion posted to the Supreme Court’s website has been assigned its own unique 
number or “WebCite.” The WebCite is composed of three elements: the year of 
decision, the word “Ohio,” and a number unique to that opinion, e.g., 2003-Ohio-
1234. The search index can be accessed at http://www.sc.ohio.gov/ROD/docs/.

•   The name of the case, in italics, followed by a comma; 
•   The  full  parallel  citation,  i.e.,  the  official  citation  followed  by 

the North Eastern Reporter, separated by a comma; 

•   The year of decision, within parentheses. 

NOTE: A number of Supreme Court of Ohio cases decided before May 1, 
2002, have been assigned WebCites but have not been assigned paragraph 
numbers.  E.g.,  Davis  v.  Immediate  Med.  Servs.,  Inc.,  80  Ohio  St.3d  10, 
684 N.E.2d 292 (1997). Do not use the WebCite in citing these cases.  

OTE:  Ohio  Bar  Reports  (OBR)  and  Ohio  Opinions  (O.O.,  O.O.2d,  and 
O.O.3d)  are  no  longer  included  in  the  citation.  Those  sources  are  cited 
only when they are the only available source for a case. 

OTE:  When  the  writer  wishes  to  pinpoint  a  particular  page  of  a  case, 
only  the  page  of  the  official  reporter  is  provided.  In  Ohio,  the  official 
reporters  are  Ohio  St.,  Ohio  App.,  and  Ohio  Misc.,  while  N.E.  is  the

SECTION SIX:  MISCELLANEOUS CITATION RULES 
______________________________________________________ 

.1. 

Short-form Citations. 

A. 

Generally 

  S

hort-form citations are used when a source is cited more than once; the full cite 
is given when the source is first cited and a short form thereafter. The short form 
generally  uses  a  few  identifying  words  from  the  full  caption. There  are  no  strict 
rules;  how  much  of  the  caption  to  leave  out  is  discretionary.  The  writer  may 
decide to use only the plaintiff’s name or the whole caption as a short form. If the 
plaintiff’s name is lengthy (e.g., Cambridge Commons Phase II Ltd. Partnership), 
a partial name could be used, such as Cambridge Commons. A defendant’s name 
may also be used (e.g., Schiller as a short form for Mendoza-Hernandez Heating 
& Cooling Co., Inc. v. Schiller). It is advisable to avoid common names such as 
Smith  or  common  parties  such  as  a  governor  or  prison  warden  in  a  short-form 
citation. 
 
B. 

Information within a short-form citation 

Provide enough information in the short-form citation—or within two paragraphs 
preceding it—for the reader to find the case in the official reports. If the volume 
number  of  the  case  is  not  cited  within  a  paragraph  or  two  of  the  short  citation 
form,  include  it  in  the  short-form  citation.  This  saves  the  reader  from  having  to 
shuffle through pages looking for the volume number. 
 
C. 

Short-form citations for cases that have no WebCite 

hen  a  citation  includes  the  official  volume  number,  do  not  repeat  the  official 
volume number when citing the same case if fewer than two paragraphs separate 
the first and second citation. If the official volume number is omitted, the parallel 
citation should also be omitted. The year is generally not repeated.

ignals are words and phrases that are used to introduce legal authority. They tell 
the  reader  why  a  source  is  being  cited  when  the  citation  serves  a  purpose  other 
than direct support. For example, a citation may be intended to provide the reader 
with authority that contradicts a particular statement. The signal contra alerts the 
reader to that fact.  
 
B. 

Style 

The first letter of signal words should be capitalized only when those words begin 
a citation sentence. Certain signal words and phrases use commas as indicated in 
the examples below. Signal words and phrases are italicized.

Use of signal words 

When  a  case  or  other  authority  is  cited  as  the  source  of  a  quote  or  as  direct 
support for a statement, no signal word is necessary. In other situations, however, 
e.g.,  when  a  citation  provides  indirect  support  for  a  statement,  contradicts  it,  or 
provides  a  useful  comparison,  signal  words  are  used  to  explain  the  level  of 
support or contradiction that the cited authority provides. As the examples below 
suggest, when using a signal word, consider including a parenthetical that clarifies 
why the case is being cited and why the signal is appropriate. 

1. 

No signal 

Use no signal before a citation when the citation provides direct support. 
In  other  words,  use  no  signal  when  you  are  quoting  or  paraphrasing 
language from the source or you are identifying a source referred to in the 
text.

se  see  when  the  citation  provides  clear  support  for  the  proposition,  but 
the  support  is  indirect.  If  inference  is  necessary  because  the  source  does 
not state the proposition explicitly, see is the appropriate signal.   

See 

2. 

  U

HOW TO USE SEE 

When  a  taxpayer  appeals  a  determination  of  the  commissioner  to  the 
BTA,  the  commissioner’s  determination  is  presumed  to  be  correct,  and 
the taxpayer must shoulder the burden of rebutting that presumption. See 
Shiloh  Automotive,  Inc.  v.  Levin,  117  Ohio  St.3d  4,  2008-Ohio-68,  881 
N.E.2d 227, ¶ 16 (the taxpayer bears the burden “to show the manner and 
extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner’s final determination” and to 
demonstrate  that  the  commissioner’s  findings  are  “clearly  unreasonable 
or unlawful”). 

3. 

Accord 

After citation or discussion of a source, use accord to introduce citations 
of one or more additional sources that provide direct support for the same 
proposition. 

HOW TO USE ACCORD 

While boards of revision have inherent authority to reconsider their own 
decisions, since the power to decide in the first instance carries with it the 
power to reconsider, such authority does not extend beyond institution of 
an  actual  appeal  or  expiration  of  the  time  for  appeal. Cincinnati School 
Dist.  Bd.  of  Edn.  v.  Hamilton  Cty.  Bd.  of  Revision,  87  Ohio  St.3d  363, 
368, 721 N.E.2d 40 (2000). Accord Natl. Tube Co. v. Ayres, 152 Ohio St. 
255, 89 N.E.2d 129 (1949), paragraph one of the syllabus (“The Board of 
Tax Appeals has control over its decisions until the actual institution of 
an appeal or the expiration of the time for an appeal”).

a proposition (see “2. See” above).

HOW TO  USE SEE ALSO 

Because M.B.’s testimony was relevant to prove the essential elements of 
appellant’s  menacing-by-stalking  charge  and  not  otherwise  unfairly 
prejudicial to him, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting 
evidence of appellant’s other prior threats and acts of physical violence. 
See,  e.g.,  Horsley  at  ¶  27,  29  (evidence  of  past  conduct  toward  victim, 
including  prior  conviction  for  telephone  harassment,  is  relevant  and 
properly admissible to prove essential elements of menacing-by-stalking 
charge); see also Skeens, 1999 WL 1082658, at *4 (defendant’s prior acts 
of  violence  and  threats  toward  his  wife  were  admissible  because  they 
were directly relevant to her belief that he intended to cause her physical 
harm). 

 

5. 

Cf. 

Do  not  use cf.  Instead,  use  compare  in  a  variation  on  the compare...with 
signal, explained below. 

6. 

Compare 

Use  compare  alone    (i.e.,  without  “with”)  when  the  citation  is  to  be 
compared  with  the  immediately  preceding  citation.    An  explanatory 
parenthetical  is  recommended.  Compare  is  used  alone,  where  cf.  would 
have been used. 

HOW TO USE COMPARE 

nlike  other  statutes  of  limitations,  R.C.  2305.07  does  not  define  the 
time  at  which  a  claim  for  the  relevant  action  accrues.  Compare  R.C. 
2305.09  (providing  that  a  claim  for  the  wrongful  taking  of  personal 
property does not accrue until the wrongdoer is discovered). 

nlike the father in Masa, Hobbs received income in excess of his total 
support  obligation.  Furthermore,  food  and  shelter  were  paid  for  by  the 
state due to his incarceration. Hobbs, however, failed to pay any support 
for more than a year. Compare In re Adoption of Canter, 5th Dist. Perry 
No.  98-CA-5,  1999  WL  668799,  at  *4  (Aug.  20,  1999)  (noting  that 
“[w]hile  appellee’s  contribution  to  Stetson’s  support  *  *  *  may  have 
been minimal, the evidence clearly established that appellee did not fail 
to  provide  support  and  maintenance  to  such  a  degree  as  to  equate  to 
abandonment”).

Compare…with 

 Use compare...with to compare two or more citations in sequence. 
 

HOW TO USE COMPARE…WITH 

The 2001 statute eliminated the requirement in former R.C. 3937.18(A) that 
insureds  must  be  “legally  entitled  to  recover”  from  their  tortfeasors  and  the 
provision  that  coverage  is  not  precluded  when  the  tortfeasor  is  statutorily 
immune from liability under R.C. Chapter 2744. Compare R.C. 3937.18 with 
former R.C. 3937.18(A)(1), 148 Ohio Laws, Part V, 11380, 11380-11381. 

8.  

Contra  

Use  contra  when  the  cited  authority  directly  contradicts  the  stated 
proposition. An explanatory parenthetical is recommended. 
 

HOW TO USE CONTRA 

If  “evidence  [is]  presented  on  almost  every  factor”  listed  in  R.C. 
3901.04(F)(1), that is “sufficient to indicate that a trial court adequately 
considered the best interest of the child.” In re Roberts, 9th Dist. Summit 
No. 18269, 1997 WL 760696, at *3 (Nov. 5, 1997); contra Dilworth v. 
Dilworth,  115  Ohio  App.3d  537,  542,  685  N.E.2d  847  (2d  Dist.1996), 
fn. 1 (interpreting the General Assembly’s use of the word “shall” in the 
statute  as  mandating  that  the  trial  court  consider  all  of  the  enumerated 
factors,  as  well  as  all  other  relevant  factors,  in  determining  the  best 
interests of the child). 
 

9. 

But see 

Use  but  see  when  the  cited  authority  indirectly  contradicts  the  stated 
proposition.  But  see  is  used  where  see  would  be  used  to  show  indirect 
support. An explanatory parenthetical is recommended.

Use see generally to introduce helpful background authority. 
 

HOW TO USE SEE GENERALLY 

 
Crim.R.  12.1  provides  that  if  a  defendant  fails  to  notify  the  court  in 
writing  that  he  intends  to  claim  alibi,  the  court  may  exclude  alibi 
evidence unless the interests of justice require otherwise. See generally 
State v. Smith, 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985), paragraph one 
of the syllabus (upholding Crim.R. 12.1 as constitutional). 

E.g., 

1. 

  1

Use e.g. when the cited authority directly supports the proposition and is 
representative of several authorities that are not cited. Accurate use of e.g. 
is  an  effective  way  to  avoid  string  cites,  which  are  generally  disfavored. 
E.g. is always followed by a comma. 

HOW TO USE BUT SEE 

While courts have admitted statements made after several hours, days, or 
even weeks, no court would admit a statement made eight months after 
the  event.  See,  e.g.,  State  v.  Wallace,  37  Ohio  St.3d  87,  90-91,  599 
N.E.2d  124  (1988)  (finding  that  a  statement  made  after  15  hours  was 
admissible);  State  v.  Nitz,  12th  Dist.  Butler  No.  CA2003-09-228,  2004-
Ohio-6478,  ¶  24  (finding  a  statement made  after  one  week  admissible); 
but  see  Butcher  at  ¶  29-34  (finding  that  statements  made  after  two 
months were inadmissible as an excited utterance).

Use see, e.g. to indicate that the cited authority provides indirect support 
for the proposition and that the cited authority is one of many that provide 
this same support. Note the use of two commas. 

 

 

HOW TO USE SEE, E.G., 

The  absence  of  loan  documents  does  not  create  an  issue  of  fact  in  the 
face of the undisputed testimony. E.g., Capital-Plus, Inc. v. Potter, 10th 
Dist.  Franklin  No.  00AP-1353,  2001  WL  604226  (June  5,  2001) 
(although  no  loan  documents  existed,  accounting  documents,  coupled 
with  the  testimony  of  the  accountant,  established  a  paper  trail  of  the 
personal loan). 

See, e.g., 

2. 

  1

HOW TO USE E.G., 

The CSPA applies to contracts to build a home, however, because these 
transactions  involve  the  purchase  of  a  service  rather  than  simply  the 
purchase of real estate. See, e.g., Keiber v. Spicer Constr. Co., 85 Ohio 
App.3d 391, 392, 665 N.E.2d 414 (9th Dist.1993). 

hile  the  contract  did  not  specify  exactly  what  words  were  needed  to 
effect  a  cancellation,  both  parties  could  reasonably  expect  that  any 
attempt  to  cancel  would  be  clear  and  definite.  See,  e.g.,  Schwer  v. 
Benefit Assn. of Ry. Emps., Inc., 153 Ohio St. 312, 319-320, 152 N.E.2d 
162 (1950) (notice of policy cancellation need not be in a particular form 
but must be definite, unequivocal, and certain).

When  citations  are  omitted  from  a  quotation,  add  the  parenthetical  explanation 
“citations omitted” immediately after the quotation, before the citation. Place the 
period inside the parentheses. If “citations omitted” is used, ellipses to mark the 
omissions are unnecessary. If ellipses are used to mark the omission of a citation, 
“citations omitted” is unnecessary.

HOW TO USE CITATION OMITTED 

 

 

 

 

“Usually,  evidence  regarding  the  diminution  in  value  is  needed  to 
determine the reasonableness of the restoration costs. Failure to present 
such  evidence,  however,  is  not  necessarily  fatal  to  a  claim  in  tort  for 
damages  to  real  property.”  (Citation  omitted.)  Krofta  v.  Stallard,  8th 
Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85369, 2005-Ohio-3720, 2005 WL 1707013, ¶ 26. 

NOTE: The original quoted material from Krofta cited a case after the first sentence, 
which  the  writer  using  this  quote  has  deliberately  chosen  to  omit.  Thus,  the 
parenthetical  phrase  “citation  omitted”  appears  directly  after  the  closing  quotation 
marks. The use of this phrase obviates the need for an ellipsis inside the quotation. 

 

 

 
B. 

Attribution of a quotation within a quotation 

If there is a quotation within a quotation, the internal quotation must be attributed, 
either  by  quoting  the  citation  provided  in  the  original  or  by  adding  the  citation 
after  the  primary  citation,  following  the  word  “quoting”  (not  “citing”).  Do  not 
omit  internal  quotation  marks.  It  is  not  acceptable  to  use  the  parenthetical 
explanation  “citations  omitted”  or  “internal  quotation  marks  and  citations 
omitted” to excuse the omission of a citation for a quotation within a quotation. If 
a quotation is cluttered with pointless internal quotations, paraphrase it instead of 
quoting it. 
 

HOW TO ATTRIBUTE AN INTERNAL QUOTATION 

 

A  notice  of  appeal  “ ‘must  explicitly  and  precisely  recite  the  errors 
contained  in  the  tax  commissioner’s  final  determination.’ ”  Newman  v. 
Levin,  120  Ohio  St.3d  127,  2008-Ohio-5202,  896  N.E.2d  995,  ¶  27, 
quoting Cousino Constr. Co. v. Wilkins, 108 Ohio St.3d 90, 2006-Ohio-
162, 840 N.E.2d 1065, ¶ 41. 

xplanatory  terms  such  as  overruled,  aff’d,  rev’d,  rev’d  on  other  grounds, 
overruled  in  part  on  other  grounds,  appeal  dismissed,  or  vacated  on  other 
grounds are italicized and abbreviated as shown, followed by commas.

History affecting precedential value 

Always  indicate  any  reversal,  vacation,  or  overruling,  even  if  that  subsequent 
action  is  based  on  other  grounds.  Do  not  include  any  further  history  of  a  case 
unless  it  affects  the  case’s  precedential  value.  Cert.  denied  is  an  example  of 
subsequent  history  that  has  no  effect  on  the  authoritativeness  of  a  case  and  is 
therefore not used, except for a very recent case.

NOTE:  Cert.  denied  and  appeal  not  accepted  are  useful  in  these  two  examples,  in 
which the case is recent. Otherwise, when the time for reversal has obviously passed, 
do not record the denial of an appeal in a history line.

•  Citations offer support. A citation must be provided in support of any sentence 
in which the writer sets forth a statement of the law, makes a legal argument, 
refers to a legal source, or quotes or paraphrases language from a source. The 
guidelines for citation style appear throughout this manual. The entire point of 
citations and of the signal words or phrases preceding them is to communicate 
to the reader exactly which source is being relied upon and for what purpose 
(for  direct  support,  for  contrast,  for  background,  etc.).  When  citing,  include 
pinpoint  citations  to  refer  the  reader  to  the  exact  page  or  paragraph  that 
supports the proposition. 

  Citations  are  best  placed  at  the  end  of  a  sentence.  Because  nonstatutory 
citations  contain  so  many  abbreviations  and  numbers,  they  are  not  very 
readable  as  part  of  textual  sentences.  The  best  way  to  include  nonstatutory 
citations in text in a way that promotes readability is to put them in a separate 
citation sentence whenever possible. If a sentence seems to require a citation 
in the middle, try to restructure the sentence to avoid the midstream citation. 
Often  a  sentence  with  a  citation  in  the  middle  can  be  revised  by  simply 
extracting  the  citation  from  the  center  of  the  sentence  and  moving  it  to  the 
end. 

  Avoid placing all citations in footnotes. The practice of placing all citations in 
footnotes  is  disfavored,  as  it  makes  it  difficult  for  the  reader  to  connect  the 
authority to the proposition.

There is only one known Ohio decision in which the court has held 
that  a  dog’s  owner  can  recover  from  the  victim,  and  that  case  has 
been  certified  as  conflicting  with  the  decision  of  the  court  below:

strike a claim for lost wages brought by the dog’s owner.

three  appear  in  parentheses,  after  the  ending  quotation  mark  but  before  the 
citation,  with  a  period  inside  the  closing  parenthesis  and  the  word  “emphasis” 
capitalized.

INTRODUCTION TO THE STYLE GUIDE 
_____________________________________________________ 

he  Style  Guide  sets  forth  standard  guidelines  for  formal  English  writing.  When  more 

than one correct standard or practice exists, one alternative has been chosen.  

he  guide  makes  no  attempt  to  be  comprehensive.  For  rules  of  punctuation,  grammar, 
diction, hyphenation, and usage that are not covered by this guide, the Reporter’s Office 
follows conventions of standard English and relies in particular on The Chicago Manual 
of Style; Sabin, The Gregg Reference Manual; Johnson, The Handbook of Good English; 
Garner,  A  Dictionary  of  Modern  Legal  Usage;  and  Strunk  &  White,  The  Elements  of 
Style.

SECTION TEN:  PUNCTUATION 
______________________________________________________ 

0.1.  Lists. 

olons  are  properly  used  to  introduce  lists,  but  only  if  the  list  is  introduced  by  a  full 
sentence. The presence of a list does not justify using a colon in the middle of a sentence. 
In  particular,  do  not  place  a  colon  between  a  verb  and  its  object  or  complement  or 
between a preposition and its object, even if the complement or object is a list. That is, do 
not write, “The elements of a negligence claim are: duty, breach of a duty, causation, and 
damages.” 

OTE: Observe parallelism in lists. If the first four elements in a list are verbs, do not 

use a noun for the fifth.  
 

HOW TO FORM A LIST 

ncorrect:  A  plaintiff  in  a  tort  case  must  prove  (1)  duty,  (2)  breach  of  that 

duty, (3) proximate cause, and (4) that he has been damaged. 

orrect:   A plaintiff in a tort case must prove (1) duty, (2) breach of that 

duty, (3) proximate cause, and (4) damages. 

0.2.  Placement of Quotation Marks Relative to Other Punctuation.

material begins with a lowercase letter, change it to upper case and indicate the change 
with brackets.

enerally,  use  block  quotations  when  the  text  will  be  longer  than  four  lines.    Do  not 
change line spacing or font, but set off the quotation by additional margins on the left and 
right.  Use quotation marks only for quotations within the block text.  The source of the 
quotation may follow the quotation, as in the first example below, or it may introduce the 
quotation, as in the second example.

10.5.  Ellipses. 

ndicate an omission of a word or words from quoted material by using an ellipsis (* * *). 
The  asterisks  are  separated  by  spaces.  When  using  ellipses,  observe  the  following 
guidelines: 
 

•  Do not begin a quotation with an ellipsis; 
•  At the end of a quotation, do not use an ellipsis after a period; 
• 

If what is quoted is obviously a sentence fragment, do not use an ellipsis at the 
beginning or end of the quotation. 

 

Indicate the omission of the end of a sentence with an ellipsis, not a bracketed period. 

hen  a  paragraph  is  omitted  from  the  middle  of  a  multiparagraph  quote,  indicate  the 

omission with a paragraph consisting of an ellipsis preceded by a quotation mark.

SECTION ELEVEN:  FOOTNOTES 
______________________________________________________ 

1.1.  Use of Footnotes. 

ootnotes are to be discouraged generally. They are intrusive and often unnecessary. 

ootnotes  can  be  helpful  in  certain  contexts.  A  footnote  may  be  appropriate  when  the 
point  being  made  is  relevant  but  would  distract  the  reader  or  interrupt  the  flow  of  an 
argument. But footnotes should always be used sparingly. The use of too many footnotes 
tests the reader’s patience and lessens the probability that any will be read. 

ootnotes are best reserved for sidelights or peripheral material. Examples of information 

   Excerpts of testimony; 
•   Statutory text; 
•   Contractual clauses; 
•   Procedural details (a party was dismissed, for example); 
•   Legislative history; 
•   Surveys; 
•  Explanatory  notes  (e.g.,  “The  term  ‘jail-time credit’ is used as shorthand for 

custody credit”). 

that may belong in a footnote: 

  •

o not use footnotes for legal analysis. If the point being made is substantive, it belongs 

in the body of the opinion. If it is nonsubstantive, it may be relegated to a footnote. 

efore  adding  a  footnote,  the  writer  should  consider  whether  the  information  being 

imparted is relevant and helpful. If not, the footnote should be discarded. 

1.2.   Citations in Footnotes.

SECTION TWELVE:  ITALICS 
________________________________________________________________________ 

2.1.   Use of Italics. 

se italics for signal words, id., case captions, and case histories in citations. 

o not italicize Latin or other foreign words and phrases. 

n quoted material, italics may be retained, added, or deleted, but all three choices must 
be indicated by the use of “emphasis sic,” “emphasis added,” or “emphasis deleted,” as 
explained in “6.6. Emphasis Sic, Emphasis Added, Emphasis Deleted” in the Manual 
of Citations above. 

se italics for emphasis, but sparingly. Overuse of italics can dilute the desired emphasis. 
Never italicize an entire quotation for emphasis. It will rarely be helpful to italicize even 
so much as a third of a quotation for emphasis. Emphasis is often best achieved through 
word choice and sentence structure. 

2.2.   Reverse Italics. 

hen text to be italicized includes words that are already italic (typically a case name),

SECTION THIRTEEN:  ACRONYMS, ABBREVIATIONS, 
AND PARENTHETICAL REFERENCES 
______________________________________________________ 

3.1.  Definition. 

n acronym is distinguished from other abbreviations by the fact that an acronym can be 
pronounced, e.g., PETA, AIDS, MADD, OSHA,  NASDAQ.    Acronyms  are  not  always 
formed from just the first letter of each component part, e.g., FANNIE MAE, NASCAR, 
NAVSAT.  Nor are they always all capitals, e.g., Eurail, laser, blog.  An abbreviation is 
formed from the initial letter of each component word, e.g., NBC, IRS, CLE. 

An  abbreviation  need  not  be  recognizable  or  widely  used.    The  author  may  decide  to 
abbreviate  the  name  of  any  litigant  or  other  entity.    Example:  Smith,  Jones  &  Brown, 
L.L.C. (“SJ&B”) sought an injunction in the trial court. 

NOTE:  Common  abbreviations  formed  by  shortening  a  single  word,  such  as  Dr.,  Feb., 
and Blvd., are not susceptible of overuse and are not the subject of this section. 

3.2.  Use and Overuse. 

cronyms and abbreviations are useful tools for avoiding tedious repetition of the same 
phrase  or  name.    At  the  same  time,  overuse  can  be  counterproductive.    A  printed  page 
littered with clumps of capital letters will irritate and discourage readers.  Unfortunately, 
overuse is not easily defined.  Common sense is the best guide. 

3.3.  Identification. 

A  writer  should  always  identify  acronyms  and  abbreviations  before  using  them,  even 
when  they  are  familiar  to  readers.  At  the  first  reference,  use  the  full  name  with  a 
parenthetical containing the acronym or abbreviation, in quotes.  Example: In July 2007, 
appellant filed an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”) to 
increase its rates. 

The plural of an acronym or other abbreviation is typically formed by adding a lowercase 
“s” without an apostrophe, e.g., SUVs, DVDs, PACs, MP3s. 

3.4.  Plurals. 
 

3.5.  Parenthetical References. 

 

 

 

 

The  author  may  choose  a  descriptive  word  to  use  as  a  continuing  reference  for  one  or 
more persons or entities.  Example: Doe seeks a writ of mandamus against the Board of 
Commissioners  of  Blank  County,  Blank  County  clerk  of  courts,  and  John  Doe,  Blank 
County treasurer (“the appellants”).  When the shortened form is chosen, later references 
should always use that form.

SECTION FOURTEEN:  THE CASE CAPTION 
________________________________________________________________________ 

4.1.   The Formal Case Caption. 

he  formal  case  caption  is  taken  from  the  original  pleading  in  a  case,  whether  it  is  a 
complaint  in  the  trial  court,  a  petition  for  a  writ  in  the  court  of  appeals,  or  an  original 
action  in  this  court.  Thus,  the  name  of  a  party  who  has  long  since  dropped  out  of  the 
litigation  may  well  appear  in  the  caption.  Names  of  juveniles  are  to  be  treated  in 
accordance  with  “E.  References  to  juveniles”  under  “14.4  Miscellaneous  Caption 
Matters” below. 

he following rules apply to formal captions: 

•  The formal caption line appears in large and small capital letters, in bold type; 
•  The “v.” is italicized and is lower case, not a small capital letter; 
•  First names are omitted. 

o determine the correct formal caption for a case, go to the original complaint, or to a 
later  amended  complaint  if  it  substitutes  a  party,  whether  filed  in  the  trial  court,  a 
government agency, the court of appeals, or here, and follow the order of names as they 
are listed on that pleading.

HOW TO DO FORMAL CAPTIONS FOR AN APPEAL 

4.2.   The “Cite-As Line.” 

n the formal case caption, the first defendant listed in the original pleading is always the 
first to appear after the “v.” In the cite-as line, the first defendant is the only name to 
appear after the “v.,” even if that party has long ago disappeared from the litigation and 
has filed nothing in this court. Thus, for all of the examples in “14.1. The Formal Case 
Caption”  above, the cite-as line would read:

4.3.   In the Matter of…  

lways change In the Matter of to In re, in both the formal caption and the cite-as line. 

4.4.   Miscellaneous Caption Matters. 

A. 

Appellees 

An appellee is a party against whom an appeal is taken. To be an appellee, a party 
must have had at least part of the judgment below entered in his or her favor and 
must stand to lose it on appeal. 

A winner below who is not made a party to an appeal by service is not a party and 
not an appellee. 

Appellees  are  accounted  for  in  the  formal  case  caption  even  if  they  do  not 
participate  on  appeal.  A  typical  example  is  the  workers’  compensation  claimant 
who lets the Industrial Commission do all the work of defending its order in the 
claimant’s favor. 
 
B. 

Cross-appeals 

When  a  party  has  cross-appealed,  follow  the  same  rules  above,  except  add  the 
parties’ cross-appeal status to the formal citation line.

and quo warranto), the party bringing the action is the relator and the party against whom 
the  action  is  brought  is  the  respondent.  The  formal  caption  should  begin  with  the  phrase 
“The State ex rel.”  

D. 

Consolidated cases 

When two or more cases have been consolidated for a single decision, each case 
has  its  own  separate  formal  caption  line,  starting  with  the  case  with  the  lowest 
(oldest) Supreme Court docket number.

SECTION FIFTEEN:  HEADINGS 
________________________________________________________________________ 

5.1. 

 Use of Headings. 

t  is  the  opinion  author’s  prerogative  whether  to  divide  an  opinion  into  subparts  with 
headings. Not all opinions will necessarily benefit from the use of headings. The reader 
of  a  short  or  single-issue  opinion  might  find  headings  more  intrusive  than  helpful.  The 
specimen  opinions  included  in  Part  III  of  the  Writing  Manual,  Structure  of  a  Judicial 
Opinion, provide examples of effective headings. 

se  headings  when  they  will  enhance  the  reader’s  understanding  of  the  opinion  or 
facilitate  the  reader’s  ability  to  focus  on  a  single  issue  or  to  cite  a  specific  part  of  the 
opinion. 

eadings  allow  the  reader  to  more  easily  understand  the  flow  of  an  opinion  and  to 
identify  portions  of  interest.  Accordingly,  choose  headings  that  clearly  identify  the 
content of the applicable material. Do not use numbers alone. 

5.2. 

 Form of Headings. 

umbered headings without descriptive text convey no meaning. 

hether  numbers  and  letters  should  be  used  in  addition  to  a  descriptive  heading  (e.g.,  
III. Laches) will depend on the complexity of the opinion. Generally, if the content of an 
opinion has more than two levels of division, the use of numbers and letters, in addition 
to text, should be considered. 

eadings  are  not  followed  by  periods.  An  exception  exists  for  headings  composed  of 
combinations of a numeral and a word or phrase that are on the same line, e.g., IV. The 
Spousal Privilege, in which a period will follow the numeral only. 

he  sample  opinions  included  in  Part  III,  Structure  of  a  Judicial  Opinion,  provide 

examples of the effective use of headings.

SECTION SIXTEEN:  COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS 
AND PHRASES 
______________________________________________________ 

he following list contains words and phrases that legal writers often confuse and misuse. 
In general, the list identifies concrete rules for legal usage. In some instances, however, 
where  a  particular  use  is  debatable,  but  legal  writing  experts  appear  to  have  reached  a 
consensus  on  a  preferred  use,  the  entry  indicates  that  a  particular  use  is  preferred.  The 
Reporter’s Office generally will follow these preferred usages. 

he primary sources for the definitions in the entries are Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate 
Dictionary  (11th  Ed.2003)  and  Webster’s  New  International  Dictionary  (1986).  The 
primary sources for rules of usage are Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2d 
Ed.1995), Garner, The Elements of Legal Style (2d Ed.2002), and Strunk & White, The 
Elements of Style (4th Ed.2000).    
   

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES  

 

  T

  T

.  Above;  above-cited;  above-mentioned;  above-quoted,  etc. 

In 
general, avoid these designations and use more specific references, e.g., 
the case or the court being referred to. 

.  Accord;  accordance.  In  accord  means  in  agreement.  For  example, 
“Our holding is in accord with the holdings of other courts in Ohio.” In 
accordance  means  in  conformity  or  compliance  with.  For  example, 
“The  officer  conducted  her  search  in  accordance  with  constitutional 
standards.”  

.  Adduce; deduce; educe. Adduce means to offer as proof. For example, 
“The  state  failed  to  adduce  evidence  of  prior  calculation  and  design.” 
Deduce means to infer. For example, “The indictment was adequate for 
the defendant to deduce information necessary for his defense.” Educe 
means  to  draw  out.  For  example,  “It  was  proper  for  trial  counsel,  on 
direct examination, to educe the defendant’s complete account of what 
occurred.” 

.  Affect;  effect.  Affect  as  a  verb  means  to  influence  or  act  on.  For 
legislative  process  were 
example,  “Her  attempts 
unsuccessful.”  “The  wound  affected  his  ability  to  walk.”  Effect  as  a 
noun  means  result.  For  example,  “The  legislation  had  the  desired 
effect.”  Used  as  a  verb,  effect  means  to  achieve  or  bring  about.  For 
example, “The mediator sought to effect a settlement.” 

to  affect 

the 

.  Afterward; afterwards. Afterward is preferred.

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES (CONT.) 

.  Alleged;  ostensible;  purported.  Allege  means  to  assert  something  as 
true without having yet proved its truth; used as an adjective,  alleged 
means  accused  or  claimed  to  be  as  asserted;  supposed.  For  example, 
“In  her  complaint,  the  plaintiff  alleged  that  her  employer  owed  her 
money; she identified her boss as the alleged perpetrator of the fraud.” 
Ostensible  means  apparent,  but  suggests  that  appearance  may  not 
reflect  reality.  For  example,  “The  attorney’s  ostensible  reason  for 
attending  the  conference  was  legal  education.”  Purported  means 
supposed, assumed to be such, reputed: “The purported author.” 

.  Alternate;  alternative.  When  used  as  a  noun,  alternate  means  a 
substitute or something that occurs or succeeds by turns. When used as 
an  adjective,  alternate  means  every  second  one  or  substitute.  For 
example, as to the latter meaning, “The defense presented alternate jury 
instructions.”  An  alternative  is  a  choice,  usually  one  of  two  choices. 
When  used  as  an  adjective,  alternative  means  mutually  exclusive.  For 
example,  “Although  the  defendant  claimed  that  she  did  not  intend  to 
shoot  the  victim,  she  argued  that  counsel  should  have  presented  the 
alternative theory that she shot the victim in self-defense.” Alternative 
can also mean affording a choice, as in “The committee offered several 
alternative plans.” 

  
8.  Amicus  brief.  The  plural  of  amicus  brief  is  amicus  briefs,  not  amici 

briefs. 

amici curiae.  

appendix.  

.  Amicus  curiae.  Friend  of  the  court.  The  plural  of  amicus  curiae  is 

0. Appendices; appendixes. Either spelling is acceptable as the plural of 

1. Approvingly cited. Use cited with approval. For example, “This court 
has  cited  with  approval  a  three-pronged  test  concerning  warrantless 
entry in emergency situations.”  

  
12. Around. Use the more formal about or approximately. 
  
13. As;  because;  since.  Because  is  the  preferred  choice  to  indicate 
causation;  since  is  also  acceptable.  For  example,  “Because  [or  Since] 
the trial court did not consider these issues, we decline to address them 
on appeal.” To avoid confusion, do not use as to mean because.

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES (CONT.) 

4. As  such.  Use  as  such  to  refer  to  an  object  or  idea  just  expressed.  For 
example, “The juror was a military officer and, as such, was a natural 
for  the  role  of  foreman.”  Do  not  use  as  such  merely  to  connect 
sentences or phrases or as a substitute for therefore.  

  
15. Assure;  ensure;  insure.  Assure  means  to  convince  another  of 
something.  For  example,  “The  defendant  assured  the  victim  that  the 
basement  was  safe.”  Ensure  means  to  make  sure  or  certain.  For 
example,  “The  will  ensures  her  daughter’s  comfort  for  life.”  Insure 
means  to  provide  insurance.  For  example,  “He  insured  his  home  for 
more than it’s worth.” 

6. Attorney fees. Use attorney fees, not attorney’s fees or attorneys fees.  

7. Between; among. Between indicates a one-to-one relationship, even if 
there  are  more  than  two  objects  at  issue.  For  example,  “The  bonds 
between  the  three  defendants  supported  a  united  front  for  the  jury.” 
Among  indicates  a  collective  or  undefined  relationship.  For  example, 
“The  consensus  among  the  three  defendants  was  that  they  had  been 
framed.” 

8. Cite; cite to; citation. Cite is a verb and, in most legal contexts, means 
to refer to or offer as an example or authority. Use cite, not cite to. For 
example,  “Defendant  cites  Miranda  as  support  for  his  arguments.” 
Citation  is  a  noun  and  is  preferred  over  cite,  where  appropriate.  For 
example, “Appellant offers a single citation in support of his theory.” 

9. Clearly;  obviously.  Avoid  using  clearly  and  obviously  as  mere 

intensives.  

0. Compose;  comprise.  Compose  means  to  form  or  produce.  For 
example,  “Six  Ohio  counties  compose  the  Second  District  Court  of 
Appeals.” Comprise means to include or contain; therefore, the phrase 
comprised  of  is  always  wrong.  For  example,  “The  Second  District 
Court of Appeals comprises [or is composed of] six counties.” 

1. Convince; persuade. Convince indicates a mental state. For example, 
“Defense  counsel  convinced  the  jury  that  his  client  was  innocent.” 
Persuade indicates a resulting action. For example, “Counsel persuaded 
the jury to return a defense verdict.”

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES (CONT.) 

2. Decision;  judgment;  opinion.  Judges  and  courts  make  and  issue 
decisions  and  judgments.  They  write  opinions  to  justify  decisions  and 
judgments.  For  example,  “The  trial  court’s  opinion  fails  to  explain  its 
decision granting summary judgment.” 

3. Finding;  holding.  A  court  makes  findings  on  questions  of  fact  and 
holdings (or conclusions) on questions of law. For example, “Because 
competent,  credible  evidence  supports  the  trial  court’s  findings,  we 
hold that appellant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  

4. Historic;  historical.  Historic  means  famous  or  important  in  history. 
For example, “The opening of the new Supreme Court building was a 
historic  occasion.”  Historical  means  of  or  relating  to  history.  For 
example, “The trial court denied plaintiff’s request to submit historical 
data concerning other jury awards.” 

5. Hobson’s choice. A Hobson’s choice is an apparently free choice that 
offers no real alternative. Do not use it to refer to a difficult choice.  

6. Hopefully.  Hopefully  means  in  a  hopeful  manner.  Do  not  use  it  to 

mean it is hoped.  

7. Identical with; identical to. Both are correct. 

8. Impact.  Use impact only as a noun. For example, “The impact of the 
defendants’  actions  was  widespread  throughout  the  community.” 
Rather than using impact as a verb, use affect or, as appropriate, touch, 
sway, or influence. For example, “The defendants’ actions affected the 
community.”   

9. Imply;  infer.  Imply  means  to  indicate  or  express  indirectly.  For 
example, “This language implies that a court may dismiss the claim if 
the  conditions  are  met.”  Infer  means  to  arrive  at  a  conclusion  from 
facts  or  premises.  For  example,  “We  can  infer  from  the  applicant’s 
failure to disclose three prior terminations that she intended to deceive 
the review board.” Speakers and writers imply; readers infer. 

0. Irregardless. Use irrespective or regardless. 

  
31. Issue  of  whether.    Use  issue  whether.  For  example,  “This  appeal 
presents  the  issue  whether  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  by 
overruling plaintiff’s objection.”

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES (CONT.) 

2. Its; it’s. Its is the possessive form of it. For example, “A court speaks 

only through its journal.” It’s is the contraction of it is or it has. 

3. Method;  methodology.  Method  means  a  process  for  attaining 
something. For example, “The Supreme Court has clarified the method 
we  must  use  to  assign  responsibility  in  multiple-employer  situations.” 
Methodology means the study of methods. 

4. Must;  shall;  may.  Must  and  shall  mean  is  required  to.  For  example, 
“All  parties  must  follow  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.”  “The  plaintiff 
shall serve the defendant within 30 days.” May means is permitted to. 
For example, “The plaintiff may serve the defendant personally.”  

   
35. Pleaded; pled. Pleaded and pled are both acceptable, but be consistent. 

6. Posit.  Posit  means  to  state  as  a  premise;  to  postulate.  For  example, 
“The prosecutor’s theory of the case posited a common motive for the 
crimes.” Posit is not synonymous with present, argue, or state. 

  
37. Practical;  practicable.  Practical  means  useful  or  nontheoretical.  For 
example, “The trial court imposed practical procedures for concluding 
discovery.”  Practicable  means  feasible.  For  example,  “The  company 
challenged  the  agency’s  assertion  that  the  pollution-control  guidelines 
were practicable.”  

8. Prescribe;  proscribe.  Prescribe  means  to  dictate.  For  example, 
“Through this statute, the General Assembly prescribed a strict method 
for  determining  whether  the actions were lawful.” Proscribe means to 
forbid.  For  example,  “Through  this  statute,  the  General  Assembly 
proscribed this conduct altogether.” 

9. Rebut;  refute.  Rebut  means  to  contradict.  For  example,  “The 
defendant  rebutted  the  witness’s  testimony  by  presenting  his  own 
witness.”  Refute  means  to  prove  wrong.  For  example,  “The  videotape 
image of the defendant refuted his claim that he had never been there.” 

0. Refer;  reference.  In  legal  contexts,  refer  typically  means  to  direct 
attention to. For example, “He referred to his relationship with the co-
defendant only in passing.” Refer is not interchangeable with reference, 
which,  used  as  a  verb,  means  to  supply  with  references.  Do  not  use 
reference to mean cite, mention, or refer to.

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES (CONT.) 

1. Remand; remand back. Use remand alone. For example, “We remand 
this case to the trial court for a new hearing.” The issuance of a writ of 
mandamus to an agency does not constitute a remand to the agency. 

2. Respective.  Respective  means  separate  or  particular.  It  is  often  an 
unnecessary  adjective  and  may  be  deleted.  For  example,  “The  parties 
argued their positions,” not “their respective positions.”   

3. Said; the said. Avoid referring to an object, person, or idea as the said 
object, person, or idea. Use more specific references, such as the, that, 
or this. 

4. Saving clause; savings clause. Use saving clause, not savings clause. 
For  example,  “Both  federal  acts  contain  broad  saving  clauses  that 
preserve rights and remedies existing outside the securities arena.” 

5. Scenario.  Scenario  refers  to  imagined  events.  It  is  not  synonymous 

with situation.  

6. Survival  action;  survivorship.  An  estate  pursues  a  survival  action  to 
recover for the decedent’s pain and suffering before death and for other 
associated  losses.  Survivorship  is  a  right  that  arises  by  virtue  of  a 
person having survived another person with a joint interest in property.  

7. That;  which.  Use  that  to  introduce  an  adjective  clause  containing 
essential  information  about  the  preceding  noun,  i.e.,  a  clause  that 
cannot be eliminated without changing the meaning of the sentence. For 
example,  “A  business  that  violates  environmental  laws  should  be 
punished.”  Use  which  to  introduce  clauses  containing  supplemental 
information,  i.e.,  clauses  that  are  set  off  by  commas  and  could  be 
eliminated without changing the meaning of the sentence. For example, 
“The  business,  which  violated  environmental 
laws,  should  be 
punished.” 

   
48. Tortious;  tortuous;  torturous.  Tortious  means  involving  a  tort.  For 
example,  “Plaintiffs  complained  about  defendants’  tortious  conduct.” 
Tortuous means marked by repeated twists or turns. For example, “The 
court  found  that  defendant’s  tortuous  explanation  of  his  whereabouts 
lacked credibility.” Torturous means causing torture. 

9. Toward; towards. Toward is preferred. 

0. Upon. Generally, use on instead.

COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS AND PHRASES (CONT.) 

1. Verbal; oral. Verbal refers broadly to words, written or spoken: “The 
student’s essay amply demonstrated her verbal skills.” Oral is narrower 
and means spoken. For example, “The parties had an oral agreement to 
settle the case.” 

2. Verbiage. Verbiage means an excess of words with little value.  

3. Whether; whether or not. Use whether alone. For example, “The trial 
court had discretion to determine whether the defendant was telling the 
truth.” An exception applies when the whether clause is an adverb. For 
example,  “The  judge  had  decided  in  advance  to  disbelieve  the 
defendant, whether or not the defendant was telling the truth.”

INTRODUCTION TO STRUCTURE OF A JUDICIAL 
OPINION 
_____________________________________________________ 

 

 

 
The Structure of a Judicial Opinion is offered as a guide to organizing a straightforward 
judicial opinion. First, it addresses the subject of authorial discretion (Section Seventeen).  
Next,  it  sets  forth  the  basic  components  and  their  subcomponents,  arranged  in  the 
traditional  sequence  (Section  Eighteen).  It  then  presents  three  examples  of  fictitious 
Supreme Court opinions, two civil and one criminal, whose structure follows the outline 
(Section Nineteen). All three cases are arranged as they would appear in the Ohio Official 
Reports,  except  that  marginal  notes  have  been  added  to  identify  outline  elements  and 
explain certain points. Section Twenty discusses dispositional language, with examples of 
various  dispositions.  Finally,  Section  Twenty-One  considers  the  topic  of  separate 
opinions. 

here are many ways to write a good judicial opinion. The guide is meant to provide a 

basic model that can be easily followed and adapted for a variety of cases.

SECTION SEVENTEEN:  AUTHORIAL DISCRETION 
______________________________________________________ 

rganization  of  an  opinion  is  solely  a  matter  for  the  author.  The  factors  listed  in  the 
sample  guide  may  be  useful,  but  they  are  not  mandatory.  The  author’s  own  outline  of 
facts,  analysis,  and  conclusion  is  a  good  starting  point,  with  further  divisions  added,  if 
desired, as the opinion is fleshed out. 

owever,  if  you  have  only  one  section  or  subsection,  do  not  use  numbers  or  letters.  
Thus,  for  example,  a  section  labeled  “I.  Defamation”  should  not  have  a  subsection 
labeled “A. Communication to Third Party” unless there is also a subsection “B.”

SECTION NINETEEN:  EXAMPLES OF OPINIONS 
CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO THE OUTLINE 
______________________________________________________ 

9.1.  Overview. 

he  following  section  consists  of  three  Supreme  Court  opinions,  two  civil  and  one 
criminal.  All  three  opinions,  and  the  authorities  cited  in  them,  are  completely  invented, 
and  all  follow  the  outline  contained  in  Section  Eighteen.  They  are  presented  as  they 
would appear in the Ohio Official Reports, with certain additional features.  

The  opinions  include  notes  in  both  margins.  Notes  in  the  right  margin  point  out  where 
elements  from  the  outline  appear,  and  notes  in  the  left  margin  offer  explanations 
regarding the format of the opinion. 

9.2.  Components of an Opinion. 

A. 

Headnotes 

 The  headnotes  are  the  italicized  phrases  under  the  caption.  They  provide  key 
words  and  phrases  describing  the  general  subject  matter  of  the  case  (e.g., 
“Taxation”),  the  subtopics  (e.g.,  “Real  property”),  the  statute,  if  any,  being 
interpreted, and the holding. Headnotes are for research purposes only. They are 
written  by  the  Supreme  Court  Reporter’s  Office,  not  by  the  court,  and  do  not 
constitute  part  of  the  opinion.  They  are  to  be  distinguished  from  the  more 
extensive headnotes written by West, which appear on Westlaw and in the West 
regional reporters but not in the Ohio Official Reports, and from those written by 
Lexis, which appear only on Lexis. 

B. 

Syllabus 

The role of the syllabus in Ohio has changed. The old rule that the syllabus, and 
only the syllabus, contains the law of the case has been discarded. The entire text 
of  the  opinion  contains  the  law;  text  from  the  body  of  the  case,  including 
footnotes, may be cited as authority. The syllabus shall be prepared by the author 
of  the  opinion  and  must  be  approved  by  a  majority  of  the  court.    All  syllabus 
paragraphs (minus the parentheticals, if any) should appear verbatim in the body 
of the opinion itself. 

urrently, the purpose of the syllabus is to summarize the legal principle set forth 
in  the  opinion.  A  parenthetical  explanatory  note  may  be  added  at  the  end  of  a 
syllabus paragraph that cites an affected case or statute, with a word or phrase that 
explains  how  that  case  or  statute  is  affected  by  the  principle  in  the  syllabus. 
Example:  R.C.  4123.52  is  not  applicable  to  occupational-disease  claims  that 
require  total  disability  or  death  to  be  compensable.  (State  ex  rel.  Timken  Roller 
Bearing Co. v. Indus. Comm., 136 Ohio St. 148, 24 N.E.2d 448 (1939), modified.)

APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for No-Name County,  
No. 00000, 2008-Ohio-0000. 
 
__________________ 
 

Per Curiam. 

 

{¶ 1} The issue presented in this appeal is whether an owner 
of  property  is  liable  to  a  business  invitee  who  is  injured  on  the 
property  when  he  slips  on  a  patch  of  ice  covered  by  snow.  We 
conclude  that  the  owner  is  not  liable  when  snow-covered  ice 
prevails  generally  in  the  area,  because  the  owner  may  assume 
that  the  business  invitee  will  apprehend  the  danger  and  act  to 
ensure his own safety. 

 

Facts and Procedural History 

{¶ 2} On December 12, 2002, plaintiff-appellant, John Doe, 
visited  the  business  premises  of  defendant-appellee,  XYZ  Auto 
Sales, to buy a car. Although the car lot had been plowed the day 
before, an overnight blizzard caused a fresh accumulation of ice 
and  snow.  As  Doe  was  crossing  the  lot,  he  slipped  on  a  snow-
covered icy spot and fell, breaking his wrist. 

¶ 3} Doe sued XYZ, alleging negligent failure to maintain 
the  lot  in  a  reasonably  safe  condition.  The  trial  court  granted 
XYZ’s  motion  for  summary  judgment.  The  court  reasoned  that 
when the owner or occupier of business premises is not shown to 
have had notice, actual or implied, that the natural accumulation 
of  snow  and  ice  on  his  premises  was  substantially  more 
dangerous  to  his  business  invitees  than  they  could  reasonably 
have  expected  from  their  knowledge  of  conditions  prevailing 
generally  in  the  area,  the  owner  is  not  liable  for  any  injury 
resulting from snow and ice.

appealed and

{¶ 4} Doe appealed, alleging that the trial court had failed to 
consider  that  XYZ  had  superior  knowledge  of  a  hidden  danger 
because the ice that caused his fall was under the snow and not 
observable  by  Doe.  Thus,  he  claimed,  XYZ  had  no  right  to 
assume  that  visitors  to  its  premises  would  recognize  the  danger 
and act to ensure their own safety. 

¶ 5} The court of appeals affirmed, holding that even if the 
ice underneath the snow was hidden, Doe presented no evidence 
that  this  danger  substantially  exceeded  the  danger  posed  by 
conditions generally prevailing in the area.  

Describes how the 
court of appeals 
decided the appeal. 

 

Question Presented 

 

{¶  6}  We  are  asked  to  define  the  circumstances,  if  any,  in 
which a business owner may be liable for an injury to a business 
invitee caused by a natural accumulation of snow and ice on the 
premises.

arguments.

principles to

¶  7}  Because  this  matter  was  decided  by  summary 
judgment,  we  review  this  appeal  de  novo,  governed  by  the 
standard  set  forth  in  Civ.R.  56.  Seeley  v.  Gallagher,  000  Ohio 
St.3d 555, 556, 000 N.E.2d 444  (2000). 

 

¶  8}  In  Ohio,  an  owner  or  occupier  owes  no  duty  to  keep 
the  business  premises  free  from  natural  accumulations  of  snow 
and  ice.  Garcia  v.  Acme  Co.,  000  Ohio  St.3d  888,  2004-Ohio-
0000, 000 N.E.2d 777, ¶ 9; Lacey v. ABC Corp., 000 Ohio St.3d 
333,  335,  000  N.E.2d  222  (2001).  This  court  has  held  that  the 
dangers posed by snow and ice are obvious and that “the owner 
or occupier has a right to assume that his visitors will appreciate 
the  risk  and  take  action  to  protect  themselves  accordingly.” 
Spears v. Englewood, 000 Ohio St.3d 444, 447, 000 N.E.2d 222 
(1989). 
 
{¶  9}  Doe  claims  that  the  general  rule  does  not  apply  here, 
because  the  ice  that  caused  his  fall  was  concealed  under  a 
covering of snow, and the danger was therefore not obvious. We 
decline  to  recognize  such  an  exception  under  the  facts  of  this 
case. A plaintiff seeking damages from a slip and fall on snow or 
ice has the burden of showing that the conditions that caused the 
injury were “substantially more dangerous than those prevailing 
generally.”  Spears  at  445.  Doe  has  made  no  such  showing.  In 
fact,  he  admitted  that  icy  patches  concealed  by  snow  were 
common that day because the melting snow had refrozen during 
the snowfall the previous night.

Conclusion 

{¶ 10} Because XYZ has demonstrated that no genuine issue 
of fact exists as to an essential element of Doe’s claim, XYZ is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The trial court therefore 
did not err in entering summary judgment for XYZ.

SYLLABUS OF THE COURT 

A  defendant  who  assaults  a  police  officer  may  be  convicted  of 
the  “peace  officer”  specification  in  R.C.  2903.11(D)(1)(a) 
even  if  the  officer  was  off  duty  and  out  of  uniform  at  the 
time of the assault. 

__________________ 

¶  1}  John  Doe  was  convicted  by  a  jury  of  one  count  of 
felonious  assault  under  R.C.  2903.11(A)(1),  with  the  R.C. 
2903.11(D)(1)(a)  specification  that  his  victim  was  a  police 
officer. This case presents two issues: (1) Has a defendant who 
strikes  another,  breaking  his  nose,  caused  “serious  physical 
harm” within the meaning of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)? and (2) Can a 
defendant  be  convicted  of  the  R.C.  2903.11(D)(1)(a)  “peace 
officer” specification when the victim was off duty at the time of 
the assault? We conclude that a broken nose qualifies as serious 
physical harm and that a defendant who assaults a police officer 
may be convicted of the “peace officer” specification even if the 
officer was off duty and out of uniform at the time of the assault.

II. The Incident and Its Aftermath 

¶  2}  On  October  19,  2005,  defendant-appellant  and  cross-
appellee  John  Doe  attended  a  high  school  football  game  in 
Anytown,  Ohio.  In  the  parking  lot  after  the  game,  Doe  became 
belligerent  and  caused  a  disturbance.  Joe  Smith,  an  off-duty 
police officer hired by the school to provide security, approached 
Doe  and  ordered  him  to  desist.  Doe  cursed  Smith  and  stepped 
toward  him  menacingly.  Smith  grasped  Doe’s  arm.  Doe  shook 
him off and punched Smith in the face, breaking his nose. 

¶  3}  Doe  was  arrested  and  charged  with  one  count  of 
felonious  assault  under  R.C.  2903.11(A)(1),  along  with  a 
specification  of  assault  on  a  peace  officer  under  R.C. 
2903.11(D)(1)(a),  which  enhanced  the  penalty.    A  jury  found 
him guilty, and the trial court sentenced him accordingly.  

¶  4}  Doe  appealed,  arguing  that  the  harm  Smith  suffered 
was not “serious” as required by R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and that the 
specification  conviction  was  erroneous  because  Smith  had been 
off  duty.  The  court  upheld  the  assault  conviction,  ruling  that 
Smith’s  injury  constituted  serious  physical  harm.  But  the  court 
reversed Doe’s conviction under the specification and remanded 
for  resentencing,  holding  that  Doe  could  not  be  found  guilty  of 
the  peace-officer  specification,  because  Smith  was  not  engaged 
in his official duties at the time of the assault. 

¶ 5} Doe appealed the affirmance of his conviction, and the 
state  cross-appealed  the  judgment  reversing  the  specification 
conviction. 

III. Doe’s Appeal 
 

{¶ 6} Doe asks us to reverse the appellate court’s ruling that 
the injury in this case can be termed “serious physical harm” as 
required for a conviction under R.C. 2903.11(A)(1). He contends 
that  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to  show  that  Smith’s  injury 
resulted in substantial suffering.  

¶ 7} In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting 
an  essential  element  of  a  criminal  offense,  a  court  must 
determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have 
found  the  element  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  State  v. 
Kim, 000 Ohio St.3d 6, 2005-Ohio-0000, 000 N.E.2d 1, ¶ 3.  

¶ 8} R.C. 2903.11(A), felonious assault, states: 

¶ 9} “No person shall knowingly * * *: 

¶ 10} “(1) Cause serious physical harm to another * * *.”

{¶ 11} In this case, the state argued that Smith’s injury was 
serious  within  the  meaning  of  R.C.  2901.01(A)(5)(c),  which 
defines  “serious  physical  harm”  as  “[a]ny  physical  harm  that 
involves  acute  pain  of  such  duration  as  to  result  in  substantial 
suffering.”  The  Legislative  Service  Commission  Final  Analysis 
of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 000, the bill that enacted the current version 
of  R.C.  2901.01(A)(5),  states  that  pain  that  is  “unbearable  or 
nearly  so,  although  short-lived,”  constitutes  “serious  physical 
harm” under the above definition.  

¶ 12} Officer Smith testified that although he was treated at 
the scene by medics and not transported to the emergency room, 
his injury caused him considerable suffering. He testified that the 
pain  on  impact  was  blinding,  that  the  examination  and  packing 
of  his  nose  by  the  medic  were  so  “incredibly”  painful  that  he 
nearly  passed  out,  that  sleeping  was  difficult  for  several  days 
because of the pain, and that he experienced frequent headaches 
for  two  weeks  after  the  blow.  He  took  pain  medication  several 
times daily, missed two days of work, and was assigned to desk 
duty for a week. 

¶  13}  Viewed  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  state,  this 
evidence  demonstrated  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  Smith 
had  suffered  “serious  physical  harm”  in  the  form  of  acute  pain 
that  is  “unbearable,  or  nearly  so.”    In  the  context  of  assault, 
courts  have  held  that  similarly  painful  but  noncatastrophic 
injuries  can  constitute  serious  physical  harm.  See,  e.g.,  State  v. 
Morretti,  2d  Dist.  Montgomery  No.  0000,  2007-Ohio-0000 
(facial  bruising);  State  v.  Beadle,  000  Ohio  App.3d  342,  2008-
Ohio-0000,  888  N.E.2d  40  (4th  Dist.)  (slash  in  scalp  requiring 
six stitches). 

¶  14}  In  arguing  that  Smith’s  injury  was  not  serious,  Doe 
points  out  that  no  emergency-room  visit  was  required  and  no 
major function, such as walking or thinking, was affected. These 
facts  do  not  avail  Doe.  We  have  found  no  authority  for  the 
proposition that a victim who is treated outside a hospital or who 
retains his ability to walk and think cannot have suffered serious 
harm.  The  relevant  definition  speaks  in  terms  of  pain,  not 
incapacity  or  need  for  complex  treatment.  See  Morretti  at  ¶  6; 
Beadle at ¶ 11.  

¶  15}  We  conclude  that  Smith’s  broken  nose  constitutes 
serious physical harm. Therefore, the court of appeals did not err 
in affirming Doe’s conviction of felonious assault.  

IV. The State’s Cross-Appeal 

  {

 {

 {

 {

 

 {

¶ 16} In its cross-appeal, the state of Ohio asks us to reverse 
the appellate court’s holding that the peace-officer specification 
set  forth  in  R.C.  2903.11(D)(1)(a)  requires  a  showing  that  the

officer  was  engaged  in  his  official  duties  at  the  time  of  the 
felonious assault.  

¶  17}  Resolution  of  this  question  requires  nothing  more 
than a simple review of the statute. The specification at issue in 
this  case  provides  that  if  the  victim  of  the  assault  is  a  peace 
officer,  felonious  assault  is  a  felony  of  the  first  degree.  R.C. 
2903.11(D)(1)(a).  The  specification  incorporates  by  reference 
the  definition  of  “peace  officer”  in  R.C.  2935.01.  Under  that 
definition, “peace officer” includes a “member of the organized 
police  department  of  any  municipal  corporation.”  R.C. 
2935.01(B). 

¶  18}  Doe  contends  that  at  the  time  of  the  offense,  Smith 
was  not  a  peace  officer,  as  he  was  not  engaged  in  his  official 
duties.  The  court  of  appeals  agreed  with  Doe,  reversed  the 
specification conviction, and remanded for resentencing. 

Explains parties’ 
arguments. 

¶  19}  Smith  is  a  police  officer  employed  by  the  city  of 
Anytown. Although he was off duty and out of uniform when he 
was  attacked,  neither  the  definition  of  “peace  officer”  nor  the 
specification  itself  requires  that  the  officer  be  engaged  in  his 
official duties or in uniform for the specification to apply. State 
v.  Shaw,  000  Ohio  App.3d  999,  2008-Ohio-0000,  000  N.E.2d 
999, ¶ 19 (3d Dist.). 

¶ 20} Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that a similar 
specification in another assault statute does expressly require that 
the  officer  be  engaged  in  his  official  duties  at  the  time  of  the 
assault. See R.C. 2903.13(C)(3) (specification for simple assault 
applies if offense occurs while officer is “in the performance of 
[his] official duties”). Had the legislature intended that factor to 
be an element of the specification at issue, it could have included 
that language. It did not, and we will not add it. 

  
{¶  21}  The  court  of  appeals  erred  in  reversing  Doe’s 
conviction  of  the  “peace  officer”  specification  under  R.C. 
2903.11(D)(1)(a).  The  evidence  established  that  Smith  was  a 
police officer at the time of the assault. No more is required. 

V. Conclusion

¶ 22} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is 
affirmed  in  part  and  reversed  in  part.  That  portion  of  the 
judgment  upholding  Doe’s  conviction  of  felonious  assault  is 
affirmed,  while  the  portion  reversing  his  conviction  under  R.C. 
2903.11(D)(1)(a)  and  remanding  for  resentencing  is  reversed. 
The judgment of the trial court is reinstated.

I. INTRODUCTION 

A. Facts 

¶ 1} On April 4, 2002, Jane Doe, age 20, arrived at the 
emergency  room  of  Fictitious  Hospital  in  Nowhere,  Ohio, 
complaining  of  a  high  fever,  disorientation,  and  vomiting. 
Within  a  few  hours,  due  to  a  tragic  series  of  errors  by 
hospital personnel, Jane lapsed into a persistent vegetative 
state, from which she is not expected to emerge. 

¶  2}  On  the  medical-history  form  she  was  handed  in 
the  emergency  room,  Jane  reported  that  she  was  on 
medication  for  depression.  Upon  examining  her,  an  ER 
physician admitted her for hydration and observation.

{¶  3}  Once  admitted,  Jane  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  Richard 
Roe.  He  could  not  pinpoint  a  diagnosis,  but  he  prescribed 
ibuprofen to reduce the fever.  

¶  4}  At  4:30  p.m.,  Roe  left  Jane  in  the  care  of  nurses.  An 
hour later, when she became agitated and began trying to pull out 
her  IV  tubes,  nurses  tried  to  contact  Roe.  They  were  unable  to 
reach him, however, because contrary to hospital policy, he had 
turned off his beeper and cell phone and left the building. Nurses 
then  called  resident  physician  Francis  Foe,  who  was  on  duty. 
Without  examining  her  personally  and  without  inquiring  what 
medication  Jane  was  taking,  Dr.  Foe  prescribed  a  sedative  and 
ordered  that  Jane  be  restrained.  By  6:10  p.m.,  Jane  was  asleep, 
and  for  reasons  unknown,  nurses  failed  to  check  on  her  for  the 
next several hours. At 10:32 p.m., a nurse checking on Jane was 
unable to wake her. Jane had lapsed into a persistent vegetative 
state and will most likely never emerge. 

¶ 5} Jane’s vegetative state was caused by the interaction of 
her  depression  medication  and  the  sedative  administered  to 
control her agitation, an interaction that is known to cause severe 
harm  or  even  death.  It  later  emerged  that  Dr.  Roe  was 
unavailable because he was drinking in a nearby bar. 

B. Procedure 

¶ 6} Appellees John and Jean Doe, Jane’s parents, brought 
this  action  against  appellants,  Drs.  Roe  and  Foe  and  several 
nurses,  alleging  negligence  and  recklessness  in  the  care  and 
supervision  of  their  daughter  and  seeking  compensatory  and 
punitive damages. The hospital settled and was dismissed. 

¶ 7} A jury trial commenced in July 2005. The jury found 
for  the  Does  and  awarded  them  $10,288,667  in  compensatory 
damages and $20 million in punitive damages, the latter against 
Drs.  Roe  and  Foe  only,  allocating  25  percent  to  Foe  and  75 
percent to Roe. The court of appeals affirmed.  

II. ANALYSIS 

 
A. Physician Testimony on Standard of Care in Nursing 
Profession 

¶ 8} Appellants argue that the trial court erred in refusing to 
allow their physician-expert to testify as an expert regarding the 
standard of care expected of a registered nurse. This is a question 
of first impression in this state.  

¶ 9} To show that the nurses attending to Jane Doe did not 
violate  the  applicable  standard  of  care  in  failing  to  inform  Dr. 
Foe of Jane’s antidepressant medication and in not checking on

Helpfulness to the

touchstone.

her  for  over  four  hours,  appellants  proffered  the  testimony  of 
John  Q.  Public,  M.D.,  a  specialist  in  internal  medicine  at 
Fictitious,  who  taught  nurses  at  the  hospital.  He  also  consulted 
with  the  nursing  staff  on  a  guide  to  nursing  practices  and 
protocols.  The  trial  court  refused  to  permit  Dr.  Public  to  testify 
on the grounds that he was unqualified to offer an expert opinion 
on the applicable standard of care for a registered nurse.  

¶  10}  “The  admissibility  of  expert  testimony  is  a  matter 
committed  to  the  discretion  of  the  trial  court,  and  the  court’s 
ruling will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.” 
In  re  Carmody,  000  Ohio  St.3d  111,  2004-Ohio-0000,  000 
N.E.2d 4433, ¶ 11. 

¶ 11} It is a general rule that in order to testify as an expert 
on the standard of care in a given school of medicine, the witness 
must  be  licensed  in  that  field.  Bolt  v.  Surgeons,  Inc.,  000  Ohio 
St.3d 800, 812, 000 N.E.2d 1235 (1985). Once that licensure has 
been  established,  the  trial  court  has  discretion  to  determine 
whether the witness is qualified to testify as an expert regarding 
the standard of care. Brockmeier v. Fedders, 000 Ohio St.3d 677, 
2008-Ohio-0000, 000 N.E.2d 1311, ¶ 25.  

¶ 12} The rationale behind this licensure requirement is that  

ifferent schools of medicine have varying procedures, 
practices,  and  treatments,  and  it  would  be  unfair  for  a 
practitioner of one school to judge the care and skill of 
a practitioner of another. Bolt at 813. Thus, a specialist 
in radiology cannot testify on the standard of care for a 
general  surgeon,  nor  can  an  orthopedist  testify  on  the 
standard for a neurologist.  
 

Lopez  v.  Pediatric  Ctr.,  000  Ohio  St.3d  929,  2009-Ohio-0000, 
000 N.E.2d 933, ¶ 33. 

¶  13}  These  are  well-settled  principles.  But  no  Ohio  court 
has ever addressed the issue presented here: whether a physician 
of  any  stripe  may  testify  as  an  expert  on  the  standard  of  care 
applicable  to  a  nurse.  We  therefore  look  to  our  sister  states  for 
guidance.  

¶  14}  The  clear  majority  of  states  hold  that  physicians  are 
not  qualified  to  offer  an  expert  opinion  on  the  standard  of  care 
for nurses or on whether a nurse has deviated from that standard.

them  to  opine  on  the  standard  of  care  would  lead  to  the  same 
muddling  of  methodologies  and  principles  as  allowing  a 
pediatrician  to  judge  a  sleep  specialist.  Kress  v.  Horning,  000 
Mass. 222, 230, 000 N.E.2d 1099 (2007).  

¶  15}  Appellants  argue  that  Dr.  Public  is  nevertheless 
qualified  to  testify.  They  point  to  his  years  of  experience 
teaching  nurses  at  Fictitious,  his  work  on  a  guide  on  nursing 
practices  and  protocol,  and  his  extensive  experience  observing 
and working with nurses throughout his career.  

¶ 16} We have no doubt that Dr. Public is familiar with the 
methods,  procedures,  and  practices  of  a  registered  nurse. 
Nonetheless,  the  fact  remains  that  Dr.  Public  is  not  a  licensed 
registered nurse.  
 

Relevant  licensure  is  an  indispensable  requirement 
for qualification as an expert when a physician seeks to 
testify  on  the  standard  of  care  in  a  medical  field.  The 
physician  must  be  a  licensed  practitioner  in  the  same 
field.  Those  states  that  have  addressed  the  issue  have 
uniformly  declined  to  deviate  from  this  rule  when  a 
physician  is  offered  as  an  expert  on  nursing  standards.

¶ 17} Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion 
in  granting  the  Does’  motion  to  disqualify  Dr.  Public  as  an 
expert  on  the  standards  of  care  applicable  to  the  nursing 
profession.  

B. Damages  

1. Compensatory Damages 

¶ 18} Appellants claim that the trial court erred in denying 
their  motion  for  remittitur,  as  the  award  of  compensatory 
damages  was  excessive.  We  review  the  trial  court’s  order 
denying remittitur for an abuse of discretion. Penn v. Roe Corp., 
000  Ohio  St.2d  928,  000  N.E.2d  555  (1976),  syllabus.  We  will 
not  disturb  a  jury  award  for  excessiveness  unless  it  is  grossly 
disproportionate to the injury suffered, so large as to “shock the 
conscience,”  or  so  exaggerated  as  to  strongly  indicate  passion, 
corruption, or other improper motive. Id. at 932. 

¶ 19} The compensatory award of $10,288,667 represented 
$9,288,667  in  economic  damages  (past  and  future  medical 
expenses  and  future  lost  wages)  and  the  statutory  limit  of 
$1,000,000 in noneconomic damages.

usefulness of 
subheadings.  The 
overarching subject is 
damages.  The analysis 
is divided into 
compensatory 
damages and punitive 
damages, and punitive 
damages is further 
divided into sub-
subheadings to discuss 
the two separate issues 
on that topic.

{¶  20}  Appellants  cite  similar  cases  in  which  large 
compensatory  awards  were  overturned  as  excessive.  See,  e.g., 
Smoot  v.  Cty.  Hosp.,  000  S.E.2d  666  (Ala.2000);  Younger  v. 
Med. Ctr., 000 Wash.App.2d 444, 000 P.3d 1000 (2008). But it 
is  not  enough  that  the  award  is  very  large,  that  it  is  larger  than 
awards  made  in  similar  cases,  or  that  similar  awards  have  been 
overturned. Awards must be judged by the unique circumstances 
of each case. Penn, 000 Ohio St.2d at 932, 000 N.E.2d 555. 

¶  21}  Here  we  have  a  very  young  woman,  active  and 
healthy, who at the time of her injury was studying for a degree 
in  urban  design.  Expert  testimony  was  heard  on  the  costs  of 
caring  for  Jane  for  her  lifetime  and  on  the  income  she  would 
have made had she not suffered this catastrophic injury. Further 
evidence established that she will never recover her mental and 
physical faculties, that she will survive in her present state for as 
long  as  five  decades,  and  that  she  will  always  require 
extraordinary  care 
in  a  highly  specialized  environment. 
Appellants  have  not  indicated  any  hint  in  the  record  that  the 
award was motivated by bias, passion, or other improper motive.  

¶  22}  In  view  of  the  evidence  adduced,  the  lack  of  record 
evidence  of  bias  or  other  impropriety,  and  the  trial  court’s 
superior  position  for  judging  whether  the  award  was  warranted 
under the circumstances, we affirm.  

¶  23}  Appellants  next  argue  that  the  Does  failed  to  prove 
that  the  conduct  of  Drs.  Roe  and  Foe  was  reckless  or  wanton, 
which  was  the  basis  for  the  award  of  punitive  damages  in  this 
case.  

¶ 24} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a 
jury  trial,  we  apply  a  highly  deferential  standard  of  review  and 
will sustain the jury’s finding if there is any credible evidence to 
support  it.  Salter  v.  Ray,  000  Ohio  St.2d  999,  000  N.E.2d  777 
(1990),  paragraph  four  of  the  syllabus.  In  our  review,  we  are 
mindful  that  recklessness  is  defined  as  “the  failure  to  observe 
even  slight  care;  carelessness  of  such  a  degree  as  to  show  utter 
indifference  to  the  consequences  that  may  ensue.”  Osgood  v. 
Lively, 000 Ohio St.3d 333, 2003-Ohio-0000, 000 N.E.2d 1111, 
¶ 14.  

¶ 25} Appellants contend that the Does failed to provide the 
expert  testimony  necessary  to  prove  recklessness  in  a  medical-
malpractice  context.  It  is  certainly  true  that  a  plaintiff  in  a 
medical-malpractice  case  must  present  expert  testimony  to

2. Punitive Damages 

a. Recklessness as a basis for punitive damages

establish  both  the  standard  of  care  and  deviation  from  that 
standard.  Lord  v.  Med.  Ctr.,  000  Ohio  St.3d  888,  2003-Ohio-
0000,  000  N.E.2d  2133,  ¶  20.  But  appellants  have  cited  no 
authority  that  recklessness  must  be  established  by  expert 
testimony.  Nor  are  we  inclined  to  adopt  such  a  broad  rule.  In 
some cases, medical recklessness can be so gross and so obvious 
that laypersons can be relied upon to judge for themselves. See, 
e.g., Davis v. Goff, 000 A.2d 444, 450 (Me.1999) (elderly patient 
left  unattended  for  nearly  three  hours  fell  off  examining  table 
and  died  from  head  injuries);  Shorter  v.  Fassbinder,  000  Ore. 
111,  000  P.3d  666  (2001)  (physician  told  office  staff  to  ignore 
patient  who  had  collapsed  in  examining  room,  because  “there 
was not a damn thing wrong with her”). In such cases, the jury 
may decide whether the deviation from the standard of care was 
negligent or reckless.  

¶ 26} We now turn to the evidence against the two doctors 

in this case. 

i. Dr. Foe not reckless 

 
{¶  27}  We  cannot  find  that  Dr.  Foe’s  conduct  in  failing  to 
inquire  about  Jane’s  medications  was  so  atrocious  as  to 
constitute  recklessness.  His  conduct  was  negligent—perhaps 
even grossly negligent—but it was not “especially egregious.” 4 
Restatement  of  the  Law  2d,  Torts,  Section  908,  Comment  b 
(1965).  Punitive  damages  are  reserved  for  conduct 
that 
demonstrates an “evil motive” or a “reckless indifference to the 
rights of others.” Id.  at  Section  908(2).  We  find  no evidence  of 
such a motive or of callous indifference here. This court will not 
countenance  an  award  of  punitive  damages  for  mere  gross 
negligence. Diaz v. Community Hosp., 000 Ohio St.3d 888, 893, 
000 N.E.2d 555 (1997). The award of punitive damages against 
Dr. Foe is reversed. 

 {

 

 

ii. Recklessness of Dr. Roe 

 
{¶ 28} We have no difficulty in finding support for the jury’s 
finding  that  the  conduct  of  Dr.  Roe  was  reckless.  Against 
hospital  policy,  Dr.  Roe  left  the  hospital  while  still  on  duty, 
despite  being  primarily  responsible  for  Jane’s  care  and  despite 
the fact that her condition was still undiagnosed. Without more, 
we would most likely call this mere negligence. But Dr. Roe did 
much more. He left without telling anyone. He took affirmative 
steps to ensure that he could not be reached. He left not because 
he  was  suddenly  taken  ill  or  because  of  an  emergency,  but 
because he wanted to drink. He could not be located for several 
hours, and when he was finally found, he was too intoxicated to 
walk.  Thus,  we  have  no  difficulty  in  finding  that  Dr.  Roe’s 
voluntary misconduct strayed well beyond mere negligence into 
utter  indifference  for  the  consequences  to  his  patient.  Had  he

            Writing Manual 

 
 

 

     

been available when Jane became agitated, his knowledge of her 
medications  might  have  changed  the  outcome  in  this  case.  Dr. 
Roe acted recklessly, and the award of punitive damages against 
him is affirmed. 

b. Excessiveness of punitive-damages award 

¶  29}  Appellants  attack  the  award  of  punitive  damages  as 
excessive.  Having  overturned  the  award  against  Dr.  Foe,  we 
confine  our  inquiry  to  the  award  against  Dr.  Roe,  which 
amounted to $15 million. 

¶  30}  When  a  jury  award  of  punitive  damages  is 
challenged,  an  appellate  court  must  conduct  a  de  novo  review.  
Merritt  v.  ABC  Co.,  000  U.S.  888,  899,  000  S.Ct.  3589,  000 
L.Ed.2d 3333 (1996). We have previously held that 

independently  analyze  (1) 

  court  reviewing  an  award  of  punitive  damages  for 
excessiveness  must 
the 
reprehensibility  of  the  conduct,  (2)  the  ratio  of  the 
punitive  damages  to  the  actual  harm  inflicted,  and  (3) 
sanctions for comparable conduct.  
 

Nestor  v.  Stubbs,  000  Ohio  St.3d  173,  2008-Ohio-0000,  000 
N.E.2d 3142, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Punitive damages 
are  warranted  only  when  the  defendant’s  conduct  is  outrageous 
and  is  characterized  by  an  evil  motive  or  by  a  reckless 
indifference  to  the  rights  of  others,  which  must  be  proven  by 
clear and convincing evidence. In re Estate of Winger, 000 Ohio 
St.3d 111, 000 N.E.2d 777 (1997), paragraph two of the syllabus.  

i. Degree of reprehensibility 

¶  31}  The  degree  of  reprehensibility  of  the  defendant’s 
conduct  is  the  most  important  factor  in  determining  whether  a 
punitive award is reasonable. Merritt, 000 U.S. at 899, 000 S.Ct. 
3589, 000 L.Ed.2d 3333. Factors to be considered when making 
this  determination  include  whether  physical  harm  was  caused 
and  whether  the  defendant’s  tortious  conduct  indicated  an 
indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of 
others. Heller v. Weiss, 000 U.S. 333, 349, 000 S.Ct. 3513, 000 
L.Ed.2d  888  (2003).  Here,  Dr.  Roe’s  conduct  certainly  resulted 
in serious physical injury that is most likely permanent. And we 
have  no  difficulty  concluding  that  his  conduct  was  outrageous 
and that it indicated a reckless disregard for his patients’ safety. 
His  intoxication  while  on  duty  and  in  charge  of  patients’  lives 
strongly  shows  utter  indifference  to  the  well-being  of  those  to 
whom he owed a duty of vigilance and good faith.

{¶  32}  Although  courts  have  not  put  a  limit  on  the  ratio  of 
punitive  damages  to  actual  harm,  the  higher  the  ratio,  the  more 
likely  that  the  award  is  excessive.  Here,  the  jury  awarded  $15 
million  in  punitive  damages  and  just  over  $10  million  in 
compensatory  damages.  The  United  States  Supreme  Court  has 
held  that  when  the  compensatory  award  is  substantial,  as  it  is 
here, punitive damages, to be considered reasonable, should not 
greatly  exceed  the  compensatory  award.  Merritt,  000  U.S.  at 
910, 000 S.Ct. 3589, 000 L.Ed.2d 3333. Hence, the three-to-two 
ratio  in  this  case  suggests  excessiveness,  but  the  actual  harm 
suffered  by  the  patient  and  her  family  was  grievous  in  the 
extreme. 
 

iii. Sanctions for comparable conduct 

¶  33}  This  guidepost  calls  for  comparing  the  punitive-
damages  award  to  the  civil  or  criminal  penalties  that  could  be 
imposed for comparable misconduct. Kendall v. XYZ Corp., 000 
Ohio St.3d 444, 449, 000 N.E.2d 555 (2001). The relevant civil 
“penalty” in this case is the potential damages award in a lawsuit 
brought by an injured patient as well as the loss or suspension of 
Dr. Roe’s license to practice medicine, which would result in an 
enormous loss of income. See id. at 450.  

 
{¶  34}  Having  considered  the  three  guideposts  set  forth  by 
the  court  in  Nestor,  000  Ohio  St.3d  173,  2008-Ohio-0000,  000 
N.E.2d  3142,  we  find  that  the  punitive-damages  award  in  this 
case  was  not  excessive.  While  the  ratio  of  punitive  to 
the  degree  of 
is  high, 
compensatory  damages 
reprehensibility 
judging 
reasonableness. In this case, the misconduct was extreme and the 
harm  enormous.  Thus,  we  find  that  the  award  of  punitive 
damages  was  reasonable  and  proportionate  to  the  wrong 
committed.  We  therefore  affirm  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment 
on this issue.

                 C. “Day in the Life” Video 

¶  35}  Finally,  appellants  argue  that  the  trial  court  erred  in 
allowing the jury to view a video depicting a “day in the life” of 
Jane  Doe,  arguing  that  it  was  irrelevant,  inflammatory,  and 
prejudicial, resulting in an unfair trial.  

¶  36}  The  video  in  question  was  five  minutes  long  and 
showed  scenes  from  Jane’s  current  life  at  a  brain-injury-care 
facility.  Appellants  objected  to  the  admission  of  the  video, 
arguing  that  the  prejudicial  effect  would  outweigh  whatever 
probative value it had.  

¶  37}  “Day  in  the  life”  videos  are  becoming  increasingly 
common  in  trials  of  this  sort.  Poe,  “Day  in  the  Life”  Videos:

This paragraph is an 
example of a 
disposition that 
explains a splintered 
judgment.  See page 
150. 

Defense  Strategies,  000  Trial  Tactician  555,  556  (2007).  We 
have  held  that  a  properly  authenticated  video  of  a  “day  in  the 
life” of an injured plaintiff may be admitted into evidence to aid 
the jury in understanding the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s 
injuries.  Sturgess  v.  Acme  Corp.,  000  Ohio  St.3d  355,  000 
N.E.2d  888  (1996),  paragraph  two  of  the  syllabus.  We  also 
rejected an argument that the video in that case had no purpose 
but to inflame the jury and should therefore have been excluded 
under Evid.R. 403. Id. at 360. 

¶  38}  Similarly,  we  conclude  that  the  video  of  Jane  was 
probative  of  her  damage  claims  and  that  the  trial  court  did  not 
abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of this 
evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of undue 
prejudice,  confusion  of  issues,  or  misleading  the  jury.  Evid.R. 
403; Sturgess at 360. The video assisted the jury in resolving the 
hotly  contested  issue  of  whether  Jane  requires  care  at  a  long-
term-care facility, such as the brain-injury center where she was 
then  residing,  which  charged  $600  per  day,  or  at  a  different 
facility that costs less than $250 per day. The videotape was the 
only means the jury had to observe Jane’s present condition and 
the medical care being provided to her. 

¶ 39} Appellants’ argument is rejected. 

III. CONCLUSION 

 
{¶ 40} Having reviewed the arguments and the record in this 
case, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in part and 
reverse it in part. Because there was no showing that Dr. Foe was 
reckless, the award of punitive damages against him is reversed. 
The remainder of the judgment is affirmed.

SECTION TWENTY:  DISPOSITIONS 
______________________________________________________ 

0.1.  Overview. 

  majority  opinion  must  contain  a  description  of  the  action  the  court  is  taking,  i.e., 
whether  it  is  affirming,  reversing,  reversing  and  remanding,  etc.  This  usually  occurs  in 
the  final  paragraph  of  the  opinion.  The  writer  should  be  careful  to  be  precise  and 
thorough  so  that  the  lower  court  and  the  parties  understand  what,  if  anything,  they  are 
being ordered to do and so that the parties and their counsel are clearly apprised of the 
result. 

f  the  judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals  is  being  reversed  and  the  cause  remanded,  it  is 
important to clarify which court is receiving the remand. It is also critical to state what 
the  court  is  expected  to  do  on  remand.  Be  specific.  A  remand  “for  further  proceedings 
consistent with this opinion” is not recommended.

ased on the foregoing, we affirm in part and reverse in part. We affirm 
the portion of the judgment holding that venue was proper. However, we 
reverse  the  portion  of  the  judgment  upholding  the  award  of  punitive 
damages, and we remand this cause to the court of appeals for a review 
of the award in light of our holding in Arbino. 

Therefore,  we  affirm  the  judgment  of  the  Franklin  County  Court  of 
Appeals  on  the  denial  of  attorney  fees  under  the  Consumer  Sales

award of treble damages under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act 
and  remand  this  cause  to  the  trial  court  for  application  of  the 
“knowingly” standard of conduct to these facts. 

 

 

We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate 
the  trial  court’s  order  granting  a  new  trial;  however,  we  affirm  the 
appellate court with respect to its ruling that agency by estoppel does not 
apply. 
 
 

We  affirm  the  court  of  appeals’  judgment  insofar  as  it  upholds  the 
finding  of  liability,  but  we  reverse  that  part  of  the  judgment  upholding 
the damages award. This cause is remanded to the trial court for retrial 
on the issue of damages only.

views  that  elucidate,  expand  upon,  or  clash  with  the  views  of  the  majority.  They  offer 
additional  or  contradictory  points  that  may  be  of  use  to  future  courts  reconsidering  the 
issue. The majority opinion may even be improved by its response to points brought up in 
a separate opinion. 

 
The  main  factor  that  determines  the  appropriate  label  for  a  separate  opinion  is  whether 
the author agrees with the judgment of the majority. If the writer agrees with the result 
(i.e.,  reversal,  affirmance,  etc.)  but  not  with  the  reasoning  supporting  that  result,  the 
opinion is a concurrence. If the writer agrees with the principles expressed in the majority 
opinion but disagrees with the result, that opinion is a dissent.  

1.2.  Categories.  

A. 

Concurring  

A  concurring  opinion  agrees  with  the  judgment  of  the  majority.  It  might  agree 
with the reasoning as well, but often a concurring opinion will express different 
reasons for the same result.  A judge who writes a separate concurrence might do 
so simply to express his or her agreement, but often concurrences are written for 
other reasons. For example, a concurring judge might write to emphasize a certain 
point  or  to  articulate  additional  grounds  supporting  the  majority  that  were  not 
expressed in the majority opinion. E.g., State v. Shedrick, 59 Ohio St.3d 146, 151-
152,  572  N.E.2d  59  (1991)  (Wright,  J.,  concurring)  (agreeing  with  the  majority 
but writing separately to emphasize a point  touched  on  by  the  majority  opinion, 
that  the  statute  in  question  raises  serious  constitutional  concerns  in  other 
contexts). 

B. 

Concurring in judgment only 

An opinion concurring in judgment only is meant to convey that the writing judge 
agrees  with  the  result  (affirm,  reverse,  etc.)  but  not  with  the  reasoning  of  the 
majority opinion. For instance, if the majority decides to reverse because the court 
of appeals incorrectly upheld a criminal conviction based on a faulty indictment, 
the  judge  writing  this  type  of  separate  opinion  would  agree  that  the  conviction 
should be reversed, but for a different reason, e.g., that the jury instructions were 
flawed or that the indictment was faulty, but not for the reason advanced by the 
majority. E.g., Leisure v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 89 Ohio St.3d 110, 111, 
728  N.E.2d  1078  (2000)  (Douglas,  J.,  concurring  in  judgment  only)  (“While  I 
agree with the ultimate resolution, I do not subscribe to the majority’s reliance on 
Cicco v. Stockmaster (2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 95, 728 N.E.2d 1066, in disposing of

this  matter.  I  believe  that  Cicco  was  not  properly  decided  and,  accordingly,  I 
continue to adhere to my dissent therein”). 

Concurring in part and dissenting in part  

. 

  C

This type of separate opinion is fully described in its label. For an example, see 
State  v.  Claytor,  61  Ohio  St.3d  234,  247,  574  N.E.2d  472  (1991)  (Resnick,  J., 
concurring  in  part  and  dissenting  in  part)  (“I  concur  with  the  majority  in  the 
affirmance  of  the  convictions,  but  must  respectfully  dissent  from  its  reversal  of 
the  death  penalty”).  The  “concurring”  and  “dissenting”  points  in  this  kind  of 
opinion  relate  only  to  the  judgment.  In  other  words,  an  opinion  that  concurs 
wholly  in  the  judgment  cannot  be  labeled  a  concurrence  in  part  and  dissent  in 
part. 

 

D. 

Dissenting  

A  dissenting  opinion  is  written  to  express  disagreement  with  the  majority.  A 
dissenter  may  agree  with  some  of  the  majority’s  analysis,  but  to  be  properly 
labeled  a  dissent,  the  opinion  must  disagree  with  the  judgment.  E.g.,  Morgan  v. 
Children’s Hosp., 18 Ohio St.3d 185, 190-192, 480 N.E.2d 464 (1985) (Holmes, 
J.,  dissenting)  (disagreeing  with  the  majority’s  reversal  of  the  judgment  of  the 
court  of  appeals  and  expressing  the  belief  that  the  appellate  court  did  not  err  in 
refusing to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur). 

Concurring in syllabus and judgment 

his type of separate opinion is described in its label.  E.g., Cater v. Cleveland, 83 
Ohio  St.3d  24,  34,  697  N.E.2d  610  (1998)  (Moyer,  C.J.,  concurring  in  syllabus 
and  judgment)  (agreeing  with  the  majority’s  judgment  answering  the  certified 
question  in  the  affirmative  and  with  the  principle  expressed  in  the  syllabus,  but 
disagreeing with the application of that principle to the case before the court). 

Other categories 

hese  are  the  five  main  categories  of  separate  opinions.  Most  separate  opinions 

fall into one of the five. Others exist that are used less often.
