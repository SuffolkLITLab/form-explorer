Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio

(Including amendments effective January 1, 2023)

The  following  Rules  of  Practice  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Ohio  include  all 
amendments adopted and effective through January 1, 2023, and apply to practice 
and procedure in cases before the Supreme Court of Ohio.

Appendices following the rules include prescribed forms and samples of the types of 
documents most commonly filed in the Supreme Court. The samples are included 
to  illustrate  to  attorneys  and  litigants  the  proper  form  to  be  used  for  documents 
filed in the Supreme Court. To ensure compliance with the rules, the complete text 
of the relevant rules should also be reviewed before documents are submitted for 
filing.

Filings may be made by delivering the documents in person or by mail addressed to 
the Clerk of the Supreme Court at the following address:

Clerk of the Supreme Court
Supreme Court of Ohio
65 South Front Street, 8th Floor
Columbus, Ohio 43215-3431

All filings in person or by mail must be made during the regular business hours of the 
Clerk’s Office, which are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding 
holidays.  The  Supreme  Court  has  adopted  security  procedures  that  apply  to  all 
visitors and persons with business before the court. These include check-in with the 
State Highway Patrol, which requires the presentation of photo identification and 
scanning of all materials brought into the court. Persons hand-delivering documents 
to the Clerk’s Office should allow extra time for these security procedures, which 
must be followed before gaining access to the Clerk’s Office. Documents received in 
the Clerk’s Office after 5:00 p.m., whether submitted in person, by mail, or through 
the E-Filing Portal, will not be reviewed by the Clerk’s Office until the next business 
day. They will be timely if the documents comply with the Rules of Practice and were 
received on or before the date they were due.

The Supreme Court’s website may be accessed to review frequently asked questions 
and  answers  about  filing:  www.supremecourt.ohio.gov.  Questions  regarding  the 
Rules of Practice or the status of cases pending before the Supreme Court may be 
directed to the Clerk’s Office at the following phone number: 614.387.9530.

(b)  The  alteration  of  hours  or  procedures  by  any  delivery  service, 
including  but  not  limited  to  the  United  States  Postal  Service,  shall  not 
affect the filing deadlines and requirements imposed by these rules.

designated  period  of  time  begins  to  run  shall  not  be  included,  and  the

Rules of PracticeRule 3.03

(2)  Notwithstanding  Civ.R.  6(A),  when  the  period  of  time  prescribed  or 
allowed is less than seven days, as in expedited election cases under S.Ct.
Prac.R. 12.08, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be 
included in the computation. 

(3)  When the Clerk’s Office of the Supreme Court is closed to the public for 
the entire day that constitutes the last day for doing an act, or is closed 
before the usual closing time on that day, then that act may be performed 
on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 

(B)  Extension of time

(1)  General prohibition against extensions of time

Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this rule, the Supreme Court will 
not extend the time for filing a document as prescribed by these rules or 
by  court  order,  and  the  Clerk  of  the  Supreme  Court  shall  refuse  to  file 
requests for extension of time. 

(2)  Extension of time to file certain documents

  

  

(a)  (i)  Except  in  expedited  election  cases  under  S.Ct.Prac.R.  12.08, 
parties may stipulate to extensions of time to file merit briefs, including 
reply  briefs,  under  S.Ct.Prac.R.  16.02  through  16.05;  merit  briefs, 
including reply briefs, under S.Ct.Prac.R. 11.05; or the response to a 
complaint under S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.04. A stipulated extension of time shall 
be effective only if it is filed with the Clerk within the time prescribed 
by these rules for filing the brief or other document that is the subject 
of  the  stipulation.  The  stipulation  shall  state  the  new  date  for  filing 
agreed to by the parties. 

(ii)  Each party may obtain in a case only one stipulated extension of 
time not to exceed twenty days, provided the party has not previously 
obtained an extension of time from the Supreme Court under division 
B(2)(b) of this rule. The Clerk shall refuse to file a stipulation to an 
extension of time that is not tendered timely in accordance with this 
rule, or if a request for extension of time has already been granted to 
the party filing the stipulation under division (B)(2)(b) of this rule. 

(b)  (i)  In  an  expedited  election  case  or  any  other  case  where  a 
stipulation to an extension of time cannot be obtained, a party may file 
a request for extension of time to file a merit brief, including a reply 
brief, and the response to a complaint. The Supreme Court will grant a 
party only one extension of time, not to exceed ten days, provided the 
request for extension of time states good cause for an extension and 
is filed with the Clerk within the time prescribed by the rules for filing 
the brief or other document that is the subject of the request. 

12

The Supreme Court of OhioRules 3.03-3.05

(ii)  The Clerk shall refuse to file a request for extension of time that 
is not tendered timely in accordance with this rule or if a stipulation to 
an agreed extension of time has already been filed under division (B)
(2)(a) of this rule by the party filing the request. 

(iii)  The filing of a request for extension of time automatically extends 
the  time  for  filing  the  document  for  which  the  extension  is  sought 
until the Supreme Court rules on the request. 

(3) Effect of extension of time upon other parties on the same side

When one party receives an extension of time under division (B)(2) of this 
rule, the extension shall apply to all other parties on that side, and no other 
party on that side may file to obtain another extension of time. The Clerk 
shall refuse to file a request or stipulation for extension of time by a party 
when another party on the same side has already obtained an extension of 
time.

 (a) (i)  To  perfect  a  jurisdictional  appeal  from  a  court  of  appeals  to 
the Supreme Court as defined by S.Ct.Prac.R. 5.02(A), the appellant 
shall file a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court within forty-five days 
from the entry of the  judgment being  appealed.  The  date the court 
of appeals filed its judgment entry for journalization with its clerk, in 
accordance with App.R. 22, shall be considered the date of entry of the 
judgment being appealed. 

(ii) Except as provided by S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.01(A)(3), the appellant shall 
also file a memorandum in support of jurisdiction, in accordance with 
S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.02, at the time the notice of appeal is filed.

(b)  Except as provided in divisions (A)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this 
rule, the time period designated in this rule for filing a notice of appeal 
and  memorandum  in  support  of  jurisdiction  is  mandatory,  and  the 
appellant’s failure to file within this time period shall divest the Supreme 
Court of jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The Clerk of the Supreme Court 
shall  refuse  to  file  a  notice  of  appeal  or  a  memorandum  in  support  of 
jurisdiction that is received for filing after this time period has passed.

(2)   Subsequent notices of appeal and cross-appeal

(a)   If  a  party  timely  files  a  notice  of  appeal  in  the  Supreme  Court,  any 
other  party  may  file  a  notice  of  appeal  or  cross-appeal  in  the  Supreme 
Court within the time prescribed by division (A)(1) of this rule or ten days 
after the first notice of appeal was filed, whichever is later. 

(b)  A notice of appeal shall be designated and treated as a notice of cross-
appeal if both of the following requirements are met:

(i) 

It is filed after the original notice of appeal was filed in the case;

(ii)  It is filed by a party against whom the original notice of appeal 
was filed.

(c)  If a notice of cross-appeal is filed, a combined memorandum both  
in response to appellant/cross-appellee’s memorandum and in support of

S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.05.

Court an immediate stay of the court of appeals’ judgment that is being 
appealed, the appellant may file a notice of appeal in the Supreme Court 
without  an  accompanying  memorandum  in  support  of  jurisdiction, 
provided both of the following conditions are satisfied:

(i)  A motion for stay of the court of appeals’ judgment  
with the notice of appeal; 

is  filed 

(ii)  A  date-stamped  copy  of  the  court  of  appeals’  opinion  and 
judgment entry being appealed is attached to the motion for stay.

(b)  If pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.01(A)(3)(a) a memorandum in support 
of jurisdiction is not filed with the notice of appeal, then a memorandum 
in support of jurisdiction shall be filed no later than forty-five days from 
the date of the entry of the court of appeals’ judgment being appealed. 
The Supreme Court will dismiss the appeal if the memorandum in support 
of jurisdiction is not timely filed pursuant to this provision.

(4)   Motion for a delayed appeal in felony cases

(a)   In a felony case, when the time has expired for filing a notice of appeal

judgment entry being appealed shall be attached to the motion. 

(b)  A memorandum in support of jurisdiction shall not be filed at the time 
a motion for delayed appeal is filed. If the Supreme Court grants a motion 
for  delayed  appeal,  the  appellant  shall  file  a  memorandum  in  support 
of  jurisdiction  within  thirty  days  after  the  motion  for  delayed  appeal  is 
granted. If a memorandum in support of jurisdiction is not timely filed 
after a motion for delayed appeal has been granted, the Supreme Court 
will dismiss the appeal.

(c)   The provision for delayed appeal does not apply to appeals involving 
postconviction relief or appeals brought pursuant to App.R. 26(B). The

Rules of PracticeRule 19.01

Section 19. Mediation Proceedings

S.Ct.Prac.R. 19.01. Referral of Cases for Mediation. 

(A)   Referral

(1)  The Supreme Court may, sua sponte or on motion by a party, refer to its 
mediator for mediation any case that originated in the court of appeals, any 
appeal from an administrative agency, any original action, or, pursuant to 
S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.02 any civil case that the Supreme Court deems appropriate. 
The  mediator  may  conduct  mediation  conferences  at  which  the  parties 
shall explore settling the case, simplifying the issues, and expediting the 
procedure, and may consider any other matter that might aid in resolving 
the case. 

(2)  Unless otherwise provided by court order, referral of a case for mediation 
stays  all  filing  deadlines  in  a  case  until  further  notice.  The  Clerk  of  the 
Supreme Court shall not accept for filing any documents while a case is 
in mediation unless expressly permitted by S.Ct.Prac.R. 19.01(A)(3) or by 
court order.

(3)   Only the following documents may be filed while a case is in mediation:

(a)  A motion to lift the mediation stay;

(b)  A response to a motion to lift the mediation stay;

(c)  A second notice of appeal or notice of cross-appeal;

(d)  An application to dismiss the case pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 4.05;

(e)  A notice related to counsel

(f)  A motion for leave to redact personal identifiers as defined by Sup.R. 
44(H); 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g)  A motion to remand.

(B)   Statements

(1)   Any party seeking a monetary settlement shall prepare a statement setting 
forth the amount of the demand and a detailed explanation for it. Such 
party  shall  submit  this  statement  to  the  opposing  parties  and  to  the 
mediator ten days prior to the scheduled mediation. This statement will 
not be filed in the case.

(2)   Parties may submit to the mediator a confidential statement analyzing the 
settlement potential of the case. The mediation counsel will not disclose 
this statement to the other parties, unless the submitting party consents to 
disclosure. This statement will not be filed in the case.

Rules of PracticeRules 19.01-19.02

(C)   Attendance

(1)   If a case is referred for mediation, each party to the case, or the representative 
of each party who has full settlement authority, and the attorney for each 
party  shall  attend  the  mediation  conferences,  unless  excused  by  the 
mediator.  If  a  party  or  its  representative  is  excused  from  a  conference, 
the party or its representative must provide its attorney authority beyond 
initial  mediation  positions,  and  the  party  or  its  representative  must  be 
available for consultation during the course of the mediation.

(2)   If a party or an attorney fails to attend the mediation conference without 
being  excused,  the  Supreme  Court  may  assess  the  party  or  the  attorney 
reasonable expenses caused by the failure, including reasonable attorney 
fees or all or a part of the expenses of the other party. The Supreme Court 
may also dismiss the action, strike documents filed by the offending party, 
or impose any other appropriate penalty. 

(D)   Extension of time to file briefs or other documents

Notwithstanding  S.Ct.Prac.R.  3.03(B),  the  Supreme  Court,  sua  sponte  or  upon 
motion by a party, may extend filing deadlines or stay the case referred under this 
rule, if the extension or stay will facilitate mediation. A request for an extension of 
time shall be filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within the time prescribed 
by the rules for filing the brief or other document that is the subject of the request. 

(E)   Supreme Court orders 

The Supreme Court may issue orders to supervise mediation. At the conclusion of 
the mediation, the Supreme Court will enter an appropriate order.

public employee collective bargaining agreement.  

In this case, the court of appeals excluded promotions from the mandatory topics of collective 

bargaining and concluded, therefore, that the promotional provisions of a collective bargaining

Rules of PracticeThis case arises from the attempt of appellant John B. DeVennish (“DeVennish”) to attain the 

rank of sergeant in the Columbus Police Department.  DeVennish joined the Columbus police force on 

March 17, 1985.  (Supp. 38.)  He voluntarily resigned in good standing on  

April 30, 1991 to work in private industry.  (Supp. 38, Tr. 15.)  On October 6, 1999, DeVennish rejoined 

the Columbus police force and graduated first academically in his police academy class.  (Supp. 38, Tr. 

16.)   

In 2000, DeVennish applied to take the police sergeant promotional examination.  (Supp. 41.)  

The staff of the Columbus Municipal Civil Service Commission (the “commission”), and later the 

executive director of the commission, rejected the application of DeVennish on the ground that 

DeVennish did not meet a minimum requirement under the rules and regulations of the commission.  

Specifically, they found that DeVennish did not have “three years of continuous accredited service as a 

permanent appointee immediately prior to the date of examination.”  (Supp. 32, 30.) 

DeVennish appealed this decision to the commission.  (Supp. 31.)  Pending that appeal, he was 

permitted to take the promotional examination.  (Supp. 143.)  On the posted list of test scores, 

DeVennish ranked twenty-first out of one hundred seventy-nine applicants.  (Supp. 143.)  On July 22, 

2001, the commission dismissed DeVennish’s appeal on the ground that he did not have three years of 

continuous service prior to the examination.  (Appx. 18.)  In so doing, the commission refused to honor 

the provisions of a contract, effective December 29, 1998, between the city of Columbus (the “city”) and 

the Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 (the “FOP”) pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117.  

(See Supp. 118.) 

Section E, Article 15 of the collective bargaining agreement (“the agreement”) between the city 

and the FOP provides, in part, that: 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

The City and * * * [FOP] agree that, within 60 days of the ratification date of this 

Agreement, they shall jointly support and petition the * * * Commission to request that 

the following be included in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations:

had at least 3 years as a Police Officer for the rank of Sergeant and at least one year in 

prior ranks for all other ranks.  * * * 

Appendix H

(Supp. 83-84.) 

Despite the terms of the agreement and the effort of the FOP, the city neither joined in a petition 

nor caused the commission to formally adopt the new promotional eligibility rule.  In determining the 

eligibility of DeVennish, the commission elected to apply the civil service regulation instead of the 

standard of the agreement, a standard DeVennish met. 

Pursuant to R.C. 119.12 and Chapter 2505, DeVennish appealed to the Franklin County Common 

Pleas Court.  (Supp. 26.)  The Franklin County Common Pleas Court (Crawford, J.) issued its decision on 

February 27, 2003, affirming the decision of the commission, and entered its judgment on March 10, 

2003.  (Appx. 11, 17.)  DeVennish filed his notice of appeal to the Franklin County Court of Appeals on 

April 10, 2003.  (Supp. 136.) 

On October 24, 2003, the Franklin County Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the 

common pleas court.  (Appx. 3, 9.)  The court of appeals ruled that the promotional provisions of the 

collective bargaining agreement did not apply to DeVennish on grounds that:  (a)  Section E, Article 15 

of the collective bargaining agreement between the city and the FOP addressed a matter that was not an 

appropriate subject of bargaining under R.C. 4117.08(B) and, therefore, the agreement could not 

supersede the existing civil service regulation; (b) the Columbus Municipal Civil Service Commission was 

an entity separate from the city of Columbus and had the right, under the Home-Rule provisions of the 

Ohio Constitution, to enforce its own rules and regulations; and (c) the commission had never formally 

adopted the promotional standard set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between the city and 

the FOP and was not bound by the agreement between the city and the FOP. 

DeVennish filed his notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio on November 22, 2003.  

(Appx. 1.)  On April 4, 2004, the Supreme Court granted jurisdiction to hear the case and allowed the 

appeal. 

147

Rules of PracticeAppendix H

ARGUMENT 

Proposition of Law No. I:   

Promotions are a mandatory subject of collective 

bargaining pursuant to R.C. 4117.08. 

R.C. 4117.08(A) provides that “[a]ll matters pertaining to wages, hours, or terms and other

conditions of employment” are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining between public employers 

and exclusive representatives unless otherwise specified in the statute.  R.C. 4117.08(B) excludes only 

four topics from this broad mandate: 

The conduct and grading of civil service examinations; 

The rating of candidates; 

The establishment of eligible lists from examinations; and  

The original appointments from the eligible lists. 

The court of appeals in this case ruled that the determination of a public employee’s eligibility to 

sit for a promotional civil service examination is “the establishment of the eligible lists from [an] 

examination” and, therefore, falls within the statutory exclusion.  As a result of this conclusion, the court 

ruled that a collective bargaining agreement cannot address the subject of eligibility for promotions. 

The court of appeals misread the exclusionary language contained in R.C. 4117.08(B) which, in 

its entirety, states: 

The conduct and grading of civil service examinations, the rating of candidates, the 

establishment of eligible lists from the examinations, and the original appointments from the 

eligible lists are not appropriate subjects for collective bargaining. 

(Emphasis added.) 

Two provisions of this section are relevant here:  (a) “the establishment of eligible lists from the 

examinations”; and (b) “the original appointments from the eligible lists.”  Accepted canons of statutory 

construction make clear that these contiguous phrases are related.  Read together, as they must be, the 

clauses exclude from collective bargaining two matters:  (1) determination of eligibility based on the 

results of examinations, and (2) original appointments of persons determined by the examination to be 

148

Rules of Practiceeligible.  This section plainly does not exclude from collective bargaining the subjects of eligibility for 

promotion or promotional appointments.  The use of the term “original” makes clear the legislature’s 

intent to exclude only original appointments.  In doing so, the General Assembly merely codified the 

standard practice of labor relations under which original hiring practices typically are left to the 

employer’s discretion and not considered an appropriate subject of collective bargaining. 

Appendix H

The court of appeals’ decision in this case would render the evident statutory scheme 

meaningless.  Nowhere in R.C. 4117.08 did the General Assembly evince the slightest intent to exclude 

promotions from the broad requirement of R.C. 4117.08(A) that “terms and other conditions of 

employment” be subject to bargaining.  Of course, had the General Assembly actually intended to 

exclude promotions from collective bargaining, it would have done so directly and simply—by using the 

word “promotion” in R.C. 4117.08(B), which defines excluded topics.  That the General Assembly did 

not do so is conclusive evidence that it did not intend to exclude promotions.  Any contrary conclusion, 

such as that reached by the court of appeals, violates a basic principle of statutory construction. 

The court of appeals’ error is compounded by its obvious misreading of the specific exclusions in 

the statute.  The court of appeals erroneously interpreted the phrase, “the establishment of eligible lists 

from the examinations,” to include the determination of an applicant’s eligibility to sit for an 

examination.  Such judicial expansion of a clear and carefully drafted statutory exclusion violates the 

rules of statutory construction established and applied by this court, and the critical constitutional 

concerns for separation of powers that animate those rules.  In State ex rel. Keller v. Forney (1923), 108 

Ohio St. 463, 141 N.E. 16, this court held that exceptions to a general law must be strictly construed, 

because of the presumption that matters not clearly excluded from the operation of the law are clearly 

included in the operation of the law.  Similarly, in Kroff v. Amrhein, 94 Ohio St. 282, 286, 114 N.E. 267 

(1916), this court held that exceptions in a remedial statute should be strictly construed.  In so ruling, 

the court embraced “the familiar rule that the exclusion clearly made in the exception only emphasizes 

the inclusion of all other things germane to the statute which are not so excluded.”  Id.; Leland v. Lima, 

3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-02-59, 2002-Ohio-6188, ¶ 20-21. 

This plain meaning of the narrow exclusion set out in R.C. 4117.08(B) is confirmed by the 

section that immediately follows it.  R.C. 4117.08(C) provides in part as follows:  

149

Rules of PracticeUnless a public employer agrees otherwise in a collective bargaining agreement, nothing in 

Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code impairs the right and responsibility of each public employer 

Appendix H

to: 

* * *

* * *

(5)

* * * promote * * * employees.

The employer is not required to bargain on subjects reserved to the management

and direction of the governmental unit except as affect wages, hours, terms and 

conditions of employment, and the continuation, modification, or deletion of an 

existing provision of a collective bargaining agreement. 

R.C. 4117.08(C) expressly contemplates that a public employer may address the subject of

promotions in a collective bargaining agreement.  Otherwise, the introductory phrase of Division (C) 

would be superfluous, and the term “promote” in Subdivision (C)(5) would be pointless.  Indeed, under 

R.C. 4117.08(C) an employer is required to bargain with respect to those matters involving promotions.

In Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd., 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 533 N.E.2d 264 (1988), this court

analyzed the scope of management rights and bargaining obligations.  The court held that “a public

employer must bargain with its employees regarding a management decision to the extent that the

decision ‘affects wages, hours, terms and conditions of employment.’”  Id. at 262, 533 N.E.2d 264.

Promotions obviously affect wages and terms and conditions of employment and, therefore, under the

court’s holding in Lorain, they are subject to bargaining.

That promotions are a mandatory subject of bargaining is widely established in the United 

States.1  For example, the California Public Employment Relations Board held that promotional 

proposals must be negotiated since promotional rights bear a close relationship to virtually every subject 

of bargaining set forth in the California Act.  California School Emp. Assn. v. Healdsburg Union High School 

Dist., Pub. Emp. Bargaining (CCH), 1983-1987 Transfer Binder (Adm. Rulings), Paragraph 43,573 (Jan. 

4, 1984).

v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953). 

Appendix H

The exceptions enumerated in R.C. 4117.08(B) are the conduct and grading of civil service 

examinations, the establishment of eligible lists from the examination, the rating of candidates, and the 

original appointment from the eligible lists.  The court of appeals found that the establishment of 

eligible lists from the examination encompasses the determination of the eligibility of an applicant to sit 

for the examination.  The lower court’s decision erroneously interprets R.C. 4117.08.  The decision 

ignores the plain meaning of the statute, improperly broadens a narrow and clearly drafted exclusion, 

and offends the basic tenets of statutory construction.  Not surprisingly, the decision is contrary not only 

to the law of Ohio, but also to the settled law throughout the United States.  The court of appeals’ 

decision must be reversed.  Applying the unmistakable language of R.C. 4117.08, this court should hold 

that the subject of eligibility to sit for a promotional civil service examination is a proper subject for 

bargaining.  As demonstrated in the next section, once a collective bargaining agreement addresses a 

subject, that agreement prevails over conflicting civil service rules.  See Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations 

A civil service commission is bound by the collective 

bargaining agreement entered into by the public employer 

under R.C. Chapter 4117. 

roposition of Law No. II:   

  P

Bd., 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 539 N.E.2d 103 (1989). 

The city in the instant case has attempted to portray the civil service commission as an 

independent entity that is exclusively responsible for promotions.  This attempted portrait is inconsistent 

with the statutory scheme of R.C. Chapter 4117.   

R.C. 4117.01(B) defines “public employer” as including any “municipal corporation with a 

population of at least five thousand.”  R.C. 4117.10(C) states that “[t]he chief executive officer, or his 

representative, of each municipal corporation * * * is responsible for negotiations in the collective 

bargaining process * * * .”  Finally, and critically, the section expressly prescribes the binding effect of 

agreements produced by this process: 

* * * When the matters about which there is agreement are reduced to writing and 

approved by the employee organization and the legislative body, the agreement is 

   

 

   

 

151

Rules of PracticeAppendix H

binding upon the legislative body, the employer, and the employee organization and 

employees covered by the agreement. 

The law provides no role for a civil service commission in the collective bargaining process.  The 

comprehensive legislative scheme defines who the public employer is, who can bargain on behalf of the 

public employer, and the matters over which bargaining must occur.  Promotions are expressly included 

as a topic of bargaining.  This coherent process requires the conclusion that a civil service commission 

has no independent role regarding promotions.  As with any municipal agency, the commission is bound 

by the contracts of the municipality, particularly those entered into pursuant to express statutory 

authority.  Any contrary conclusion would frustrate the legislative scheme and severely disrupt 

governmental operations. 

This court recently recognized the importance of permitting the Act to function as intended, 

without local interference from municipalities or their agencies.  In Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd., 

43 Ohio St.3d 1, this court found that R.C. Chapter 4117 is a constitutional enactment within the 

General Assembly’s authority to enact employee welfare legislation pursuant to Section 34, Article II of 

the Ohio Constitution.  Accordingly, the court held, at paragraph two of the syllabus, that the 

functioning of the Act may not be impaired, limited or negated by local enactments pursuant to the 

Home-Rule provision, Section 3, Article XVIII.  The lower court’s decision in the case now before the 

court threatens this critical allocation of responsibility for governmental labor relations.  If allowed to 

stand, the court of appeals’ decision will create chaos in the collective bargaining process and frustrate 

the essential objective of establishing an orderly and constructive relationship between the public 

employer and its employees. 

Before the Act was adopted to promote this objective, public labor relations were characterized by 

wide and irrational variations among various local governmental entities relating to all manner of terms 

and conditions of employment.  Not long ago, this court recalled that deplorable time.  In Kettering v. 

State Emp. Relations Bd., 26 Ohio St.3d 50, 56, 26 OBR 42, 496 N.E.2d 983 (1986), this court stated: 

A myopic insistence on returning a significant portion of Ohio’s public employee 

labor relations to the pre-Act ad hoc ‘system,’ under the rubric of local self-government 

powers, only invites a return to the very litigation and controversy which had 

152

Rules of PracticeAppendix H

prompted the General Assembly to address that distressing state of affairs. * * *  

(Footnote omitted.) 

The decision below represents precisely the sort of return to the pre-Act “system” that this court 

condemned in Kettering, supra.  This court’s holdings in Rocky River and Kettering make clear that, under 

the Act, a collective bargaining agreement binds the municipality and all of its agencies.  No municipal 

agency can operate independently of that agreement; nor can it render the agreement a nullity by 

purporting to assume control over a term or condition of employment that is governed by the 

agreement. 

In accordance with this important principle, the court of appeals in State ex rel. Darvanan v. 

Youngstown (Jan. 27, 1987), Mahoning App. No. 85 C.A. 131, directly addressed a conflict between a 

negotiated promotional procedure and municipal civil service commission control over promotions.  

Relying on R.C. 4117.10, the court held that bargaining under the Public Employees’ Collective 

Bargaining Act superseded conflicting language in the Youngstown City Charter: 

It is our conclusion that [R.C.] Chapter 4117. authorizes public employers and public 

employees to enter into labor agreements which agreements provide for promotions 

within the classified services without competitive examinations and that such a process 

does not conflict with the Constitution or laws of Ohio.   

Id. at 7. 

In Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9 v. Columbus, Franklin C.P. No. 86CV-04-2336 

(June 11, 1987), the common pleas court followed this logic when it restrained the city from conducting 

police promotional examinations without the addition of seniority points.  In ruling on a motion for 

equitable relief, Judge George C. Smith, in a consent decree, included the civil service commission as 

part of the city administration.  (Supp. 177.) 

The city itself has acknowledged that the civil service commission does not occupy any 

independent status.  In stipulations filed by the parties in a SERB case, State Emp. Relations Bd. v. 

Columbus, Docket No. 86-ULP-04-0122, 5 OPER, Paragraph 5119 (SERB Hearing Officer), Stipulation – 

Admission No. 15 (Dec. 31, 1987) reads as follows:
