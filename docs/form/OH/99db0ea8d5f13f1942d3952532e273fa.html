reasonable cost,  and shall inform the _______________  County Child  Support  Enforcement Agency 
when health care coverage for the child(ren) has been obtained.   

f private health insurance coverage becomes available to the child support obligor at a reasonable cost, 
the  child  support  obligor  shall  inform  the  __________________  County  Child  Support  Enforcement 
Agency and may seek a modification of health care coverage from the Court with respect to a Court child 
support order, or from the agency with respect to an administrative support order. 

   
  Private Health Insurance Coverage IS available for the minor child(ren). 

The available private health insurance coverage for the minor child(ren) is accessible because:  

 

(Check one of the following three boxes) 
  Primary care services are within thirty (30) miles of the child(ren)’s residence. 
  The Court permits primary care services farther than thirty (30) miles of the child(ren)’s residence

health insurance coverage to the person required to provide private health insurance coverage for the 
child(ren) subject to the child support order does not exceed an amount equal to five percent (5%) of 
the annual income of that person.

  The child support obligee is rebuttably presumed to be the appropriate parent to 
provide private health insurance coverage for the child(ren).

child(ren) that is reasonable in cost. 
  The child support obligor already has private health insurance coverage in place 
for  the  child(ren)  that  is  not  reasonable  in  cost,  but  the  child  support  obligor 
wishes to be named the private health insurance obligor and provide coverage. 
  The child support  obligor can obtain private  health insurance coverage for the 
child(ren) that is reasonable in cost through an employer or other source. 
  The child support obligee is a non-parent individual or agency that has no duty 
to provide medical support. 
  Both parents wish to provide and already have private health insurance coverage 
in place or have private health insurance coverage available for the child(ren). 

If both parents are providing private health insurance coverage for the minor child(ren), 
Plaintiff’s  Defendant’s  private  health  insurance  coverage  plan  shall  be  considered  the 
primary private health insurance coverage plan for the child(ren). 

Should private health insurance coverage be cancelled for any reason, the parent 
ordered to maintain private health insurance coverage shall immediately notify the 
other parent of the cancellation.
