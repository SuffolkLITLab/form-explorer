      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION 
COURT OF APPEALS REPORT FORMS 

 
I. 

MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY AND CONSISTENCY 

A.  Mathematical  Accuracy.  Reports  will  be  considered  mathematically  accurate  if  the 

tests set forth in divisions (A)(1) through (A)(3) are met. 
1.  The sum of cases pending on the first day of the period, new cases filed, and cases 
transferred in, reactivated, or redesignated, minus the total cases terminated, must 
equal the cases pending at the end of the period. 

2.  The sum of cases in every column on a given line must equal the cases in the Total 

column for that line. 

3.  Where a Total column intersects a Total line, the entry must be the same, whether 

arrived at by adding horizontally or vertically. 

B.  Quarter-to-Quarter Consistency. The number of cases reported to be pending at the end 
of  any  reporting  period  must  equal  the  number  of  cases  reported  as  pending  at  the 
beginning of the next reporting period. 

C.  Correction of Reporting Errors. When errors are discovered on any report that has been 
submitted to the Court Statistical Reporting Section, the preparer shall submit a corrected 
report for the same reporting period and clearly indicate on the face of the report that it 
is corrected. The preparer shall explain in writing the nature of the error or errors being 
corrected and shall specifically refer to the line number and column letter designations of 
the erroneous entry or entries. 

Generally,  errors  shall  be  corrected  by  submitting  amended  reports  to  the  Court 
Statistical  Reporting  Section.  However,  where  an  error  cannot  be  traced  to  a  specific 
report  period,  adjustments  shall  be  made  on  the  current  report  form.  Erroneously 
unreported cases will be shown as reactivated in the proper column. Time guidelines shall 
be  computed based  on the original  filing  date. Cases  erroneously  reported as  pending 
shall  be  terminated  as  "Other  Terminations".  Thus  in  accordance  with  I.B.  above,  the 
number of cases reported as pending at the end of any reporting period will always equal 
the number of cases reported as pending at the beginning of the next report period even 
when adjustments are necessary. 

II. 

COMPREHENSIVENESS AND COHERENCE: PREPARATION OF THE REPORTS 

While mathematical accuracy and internal consistency may be controlled by thorough auditing, 
comprehensiveness (reporting the filing and termination of all cases) and coherence (all courts 
consistently  defining  and  reporting  cases  with  similar  fact  patterns  in  a  similar  way)  can  be 
accomplished only by carefully observing the definitions applicable to each column and line.

REPORT LINES - DEFINITIONS 

Each line on the Presiding Judge Report is marked with a numeric designator. These numbers, 
when used with the vertical column letters, may be used to identify any entry. 

The following definitions describe the types of case activity that should be reported on each line. 

SECTION I. DISTRICT TOTALS 

1.  Pending  Beginning  of  Period  -  Line  1.  All  cases  pending  at  the  beginning  of  the  reporting 
period must be reported in the appropriate column on this line. Line 1 must be the same as 
Line 10 (Pending End of Period) of the Presiding Judge Report filed for the preceding quarter. 

2.  New  Cases  Filed  -  Line  2.  All  new  cases  filed  during  the  quarter  must  be  reported  in  the 
appropriate column on this line. Cases should be reported when the Notice of Appeal has 
been docketed in the Court of Appeals. 

3.  Cases Transferred In, Reactivated, or Redesignated - Line 3.  

a.  A case that previously has been assigned to another court and transferred to the 
reporting court is reported in the appropriate column on this line. The indicated 
time period for disposition begins when the reporting court receives the case. 

b.  All cases that previously have been reported as terminated are to be reported in 
the appropriate column on Line 3 during any quarter in which they are reactivated 
for further proceedings. 

A case that previously has been terminated because of a bankruptcy stay and in 
which the stay is lifted is reactivated and reported in the appropriate column on 
this line. The indicated time period for disposition (time guideline) is suspended 
for the period of time that the stay is effective. 

c.  A case initially may be reported in a particular column and it later may become 
apparent that the case should be classified in a different category. In that event, 
the  case  should  be  reported  as  terminated  on  Line  8  and  reported  as  a 
redesignated  case  in  the  appropriate  column  on  this  line.  The  indicated  time 
period  for  termination  is  computed  based  on  the  date  the  case  was  originally 
reported on the Administrative Judge Report. 

4.  Total - Line 4. The sum of Lines 1, 2, and 3 in each column should be reported on Line 4. When 
added horizontally, the sum of the entries on Line 4 in Columns A through I must equal the 
sum of Lines 1, 2, and 3 in Column T.

SECTION II. TERMINATIONS BY 

For reporting purposes, a case is considered terminated when a journal entry of judgment is filed 
with the clerk of court for journalization. 

5.  Decisions or Opinions - Line 5. This line is used to report all cases terminated by a full opinion, 

decision, or per curium opinion of the court and may include dismissals. 

6.  Dismissal - Line 6. This line is used to report cases terminated by a dismissal, whether by the 

7.  Bankruptcy Stay - Line 7. All cases in which a bankruptcy stay has been issued are reported 

parties to the appeal or the court. 

in the appropriate column on Line 7. 

In these limited situations, final disposition of a particular case is beyond the control of the 
appellate court. If a bankruptcy stay is removed, the case is reported as reactivated on line 3. 
The indicated time period (time guideline) for termination is suspended for the period of time 
in which the stay is effective. 

8.  Other  Terminations  -  Line  8.  This  line  is  used  to  report  cases  terminated  for  reporting 
purposes by action other than those included above. Transfers to other districts, mediation 
terminations, and reporting corrections are examples of cases included on this line. 

Cases Referred to Dispute Resolution: Cases in which the parties are court ordered to engage 
in a dispute resolution process, or upon notice that the parties are voluntarily mediating their 
dispute  pursuant  to  the  Uniform  Mediation  Act  and  Sup.R.  16,  may  be  placed  on  inactive 
status on Line 8, Other Terminations.  

For purposes of calculating the time standard, time is permitted to toll for no more than 60 
days during the life of the case. Cases are to be reactivated on Line 3 immediately upon the 
court receiving notice of the conclusion of the dispute resolution process or at the conclusion 
of the 60-day period, whichever comes first. Upon the conclusion of the tolling event, time 
calculation resumes.. 

Courts are strongly encouraged to utilize a tickler system in their case management system 
to monitor the 60-day period and should receive regular status reports to monitor cases in 
the dispute resolution process. 

Note: The parties may continue to engage in the dispute resolution process after the 60-day 
tolling  period  has  passed,  however  the  case  must  be  returned  to  active  status  at  the 
conclusion of this time period and time will continue to be counted with regard to the time 
standard.  

9.  Total Terminations - Line 9. The sum of Lines 5 through 8 is reported on Line 9. When added 
horizontally, the sum reported on Line 9 for Columns A through I must equal the sum of Lines 
5 through 8 in Column T.

10. Pending End of Period - Line 10. The number of cases pending at the close of business on the 
last day of the reporting period is reported in the appropriate column on Line 10. This figure 
is obtained by subtracting the number of total terminations (line 9) from the number of total 
cases (line 4). 

11. Number Pending Beyond Time Guideline - Line 11. The number of cases pending beyond the 

applicable time guideline is reported on Line 11. 

a.  The time guideline for each category of case is indicated on the line immediately 

above Line 10. 

b.  To compute the length of time a case has been pending, the starting date should 

be the date on which the case was filed in or transferred to the reporting court. 

c.  The  time  period  for  cases  that  have  been  terminated  and  subsequently 
reactivated is the sum of the time elapsed from the date the case originally was 
filed  until  it  initially  was  terminated,  plus  the  time  elapsed  since  the  case  was 
reactivated. 

SECTION III. STATUS OF PENDING CASES 

12. Number Pending With No Record Filed - Line 12. This line is used to report the number of 
pending  cases  in  which the full  record  of  trial  court proceedings has  not  been  filed.  Since 
there is no record of proceedings in original actions, no entry is made in Column D for this 
line. 

13. Number Pending Beyond Time Guideline - Line 13. All pending cases in which the record has 
not been filed (Line 12) within the applicable time period are reported on this line. The time 
guideline for each category of case is indicated on the line above line 13. 

14. Number Pending With Transcript of Proceedings Not Filed Within 180 Days - Column 14. 
This  line  is  used  to  report  the  number  of  pending  cases  in  which  a  transcript  of  the 
proceedings has not been filed within 180 days of the date the appeal was filed. 

15. Number Pending With Record Filed But All Briefs Not Received - Line 15. This line is used to 
report the number of pending cases in which the record has been filed, but all briefs have not 
been filed. Since there is no record filed in original actions, the entry for Column D should be 
the number of pending original actions in which all briefs have not been filed. 

16. Number Pending Beyond Time Guideline - Line 16. This line is used to report the number of 
pending cases in which the record has been filed, but all briefs have not been filed within the 
applicable time period.

17. Number Pending With All Papers In But Not Argued - Line 17. This line is used to report the 
number of pending cases in which the record and all briefs have been filed, but the case has 
not been argued before the court. Cases in which all papers have been filed, oral argument 
will not be held, and the case has not been assigned, will also be included on this line. 

18. Number Pending Beyond Time Guideline - Line 18. This line is used to report the number of 
pending cases in which all papers are in, but that have not been argued (Line 17) within the 
applicable time guideline. 

The time guideline for each category of case is indicated on the line immediately above Line 
18.  The  time  period  begins  to  run  from  the  date  on  which  all  papers  necessary  for  the 
determination of the appeal have been filed. 

19. Number Assigned But No Opinion Released - Line 19. This line is used to report the number 
of cases that have been argued, if applicable, and assigned for an opinion or decision to be 
written, but the opinion or decision has not been released. 

20. Opinions Released But Not Journalized - Line 20. This line is used to report those cases in 

which a written opinion or decision has been released, but not journalized. 

21. Cases Pending Beyond Time Guideline - Line 21. This line is used to report the total number 
of cases from Lines 19 and 20 in which the action indicated on each line has not taken place 
within the applicable time guideline. 

The time guideline for each category of case is indicated on the line above Line 21. The time 
period for Line 19 begins to run on the date the case is assigned for the writing of an opinion; 
the time period for Line 20 begins to run on the date an opinion is released. If none of the 
cases reflected on Lines 19 and 20 have been pending beyond the indicated time guidelines, 
the entry for the applicable column should be zero.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION 
COURT OF APPEALS REPORT FORMS 

 
9.  Court of Claims - Column I. This column is used to report the number of appeals arising from 
decisions of the Court of Claims of Ohio. Section 2743.20 of the Revised Code provides that 
appeals from the Court of Claims shall be heard in the same court as appeals from the Franklin 
County  Court  of  Common  Pleas.  Thus,  this  column  is  applicable  only  to  the  Tenth  District 
Court of Appeals (Franklin County) and the entry for all other courts of appeals must be zero. 

10. Total - Column T. This column shows the sum of cases in columns A through I. If no activity is 

reported in any column, a zero should appear in that column. 

TERMINATION LINE 

For reporting purposes, a case is considered terminated when a journal entry of judgment is filed 
with the clerk of court for journalization. 

1.  Decision or Opinion - All cases terminated by the reporting judge by a full opinion, decision, 

or per curium opinion will be reported in the proper column of this line. 

2.  Other Terminations - All cases terminated for reporting purposes by action other than those 
reported above will be reported in the proper column on this line. Transfers to other judges 
are examples of cases reported on this line. 

SIGNATURE BLOCK 

A.  The reporting judge must sign and date the report on the line marked "Appellate Judge". A 
report of the activity of a visiting judge, submitted by the presiding or administrative judge, 
may be signed by the visiting judge, or by the presiding or administrative judge. 

B.  The preparer, if other than the judge, must sign and date the report and include his or her 
telephone number on the line marked "Preparer and telephone number if other than judge." 

C.  The  presiding  or  administrative  judge  must  sign  and  date  the  Appellate  Judge  Report 
submitted by each judge of the court, and the Appellate Judge Report for each visiting judge 
for whom a report is submitted 

D.  Each reporting judge must conduct an annual physical case inventory and include the date of 
the most recent inventory in the box provided at the top right hand corner of this form (Sup. 
R. 38).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
