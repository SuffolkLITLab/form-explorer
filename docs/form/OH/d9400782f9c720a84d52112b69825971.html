Date

As of 12/7/20 this new version of the IT 4 combines and replaces the following forms: IT 4 (previous version), IT 4NR, IT 4 MIL, and IT MIL SP.

IT 4 Instructions

Most  individuals  are  subject  to  Ohio  income  tax  on  their 
wages,  salaries,  or  other  compensation.  To  ensure  this 
tax  is  paid,  employers  maintaining  an  office  or  transacting 
business in Ohio must withhold Ohio income tax, and school 
district income tax if applicable, from each individual who is 
an employee. 

Note: If you do not request additional withholding from your 
compensation, you may need to make estimated income tax 
payments using form IT 1040ES or estimated school district 
income tax payments using the SD 100ES. Individuals who 
commonly  owe  more  in  Ohio  income  taxes  than  what  is 
withheld from their compensation include:

Such employees who are subject to Ohio income tax (and 
school  district  income  tax,  if  applicable)  should  complete 
sections I, II, and IV of the IT 4 to have their employer withhold 
the  appropriate  Ohio  taxes  from  their  compensation.  If  the 
employee does not complete the IT 4 and return it to his/her 
employer, the employer:

 z Will withhold Ohio tax based on the employee claiming 

zero exemptions, and

 z Will not withhold school district income tax, even if the 

employee lives in a taxing school district.

An  individual  may  be  subject  to  an  interest  penalty  for 
underpayment  of  estimated  taxes  (on  form  IT/SD  2210) 
based on under-withholding.

Certain  employees  may  be  exempt  from  Ohio  withholding 
because  their  income  is  not  subject  to  Ohio  tax.  Such 
employees should complete sections I, III, and IV of the IT 
4 only.

The IT 4 does not need to be filed with the Department 
of Taxation. Your employer must maintain a copy as part of 
its records.

R.C. 5747.06(A) and Ohio Adm.Code 5703-7-10.

Section I

Enter  the  four-digit  school  district  number  of  your  primary 
address.  If you do not know your school district of residence 
or its school district number, use The Finder at tax.ohio.gov. 
You  can  also  verify  your  school  district  by  contacting  your 
county auditor or county board of elections.

If  you  move  during  the  tax  year,  complete  an  updated  IT 
4  immediately  reflecting  your  new  address  and/  or  school 
district of residence.

Section II

Line 1: If you can be claimed on someone else’s Ohio income 
tax return as a dependent, then you are to enter “0” on this 
line. Everyone else may enter “1”.

Line  2:  If  you  are  single,  enter  “0”  on  this  line.  If  you  are 
married and you and your spouse file separate Ohio Income 
tax  returns  as  “Married  filing  Separately”  then  enter  “0”  on 
this line.

Line 3: You are allowed one exemption for each dependent. 
Your  dependents  for  Ohio  income  tax  purposes  are  the 
same as your dependents for federal income tax purposes. 
See R.C. 5747.01(O).

Line 5: If you expect to owe more Ohio income tax than the 
amount withheld from your compensation, you can request 
that  your  employer  withhold  an  additional  amount  of  Ohio 
income tax. This amount should be reported in whole dollars. 

 z Spouses who file a joint Ohio income tax return and both 

report income, and

 z Individuals  who  have  multiple  jobs,  all  of  which  are 

subject to Ohio withholding.

Section III

This  section  is  for  individuals  whose  income  is  deductible 
or  excludable  from  Ohio  income  tax,  and  thus  employer 
withholding  is  not  required.  Such  employee  should  check 
the appropriate box to indicate which exemption applies to 
him/her. Checking the box will cause your employer to not 
withhold Ohio income tax and/or school district income tax. 
The exemptions include:

 z Reciprocity Exemption: If you are a resident of Indiana, 
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Michigan or West Virginia and 
you work in Ohio, you do not owe Ohio income tax on 
your  compensation.  Instead,  you  should  have  your 
employer  withhold  income  tax  for  your  resident  state. 
R.C. 5747.05(A)(2).

 z Resident Military Servicemember Exemption:  If  you  are 
an  Ohio  resident  and  a  member  of  the  United  States 
Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard (or 
the reserve components of these branches of the military) 
or  a  member  of  the  National  Guard,  you  do  not  owe 
Ohio  income  tax  or  school  district  income  tax  on  your 
active duty  military  pay  and  allowances  received  while 
stationed outside of Ohio. 

This exemption does not apply to compensation for nonactive 
duty status or received while you are stationed in Ohio. 

R.C. 5747.01(A)(21).

 z Nonresident  Military  Servicemember  Exemption: 

If 
you  are  a  nonresident  of  Ohio  and  a  member  of  the 
uniformed  services  (as  defined  in  10  U.S.C.  §101), 
you  do  not  owe  Ohio  income  tax  or  school  district 
income  tax  on  your  military  pay  and  allowances. 

 z Nonresident Civilian Spouse of a Military Servicemember 
Exemption:  If  you  are  the  civilian  spouse  of  a  military 
servicemember,  your  pay  may  be  exempt  from  Ohio 
income  tax  and  school  district  income  tax  if  all  of  the 
following are true:
 y
 y
 y
 y

Your spouse is a nonresident of Ohio;
You and your spouse are residents of the same state;
Your spouse is stationed in Ohio on military orders; and
You are present in Ohio solely to be with your spouse.

You must provide a copy of the employee’s spousal military 
identification card issued to the employee by the Department 
of Defense when completing the IT 4.

As of 12/7/20 this new version of the IT 4 combines and replaces the following forms: IT 4 (previous version), IT 4NR, IT 4 MIL, and IT MIL SP.

Note:  For  more 
taxation  of  military 
servicemembers and their civilian spouses, see 50a U.S.C. 
§571.

information  on 

 z Statutory Withholding Exemptions: Compensation 
earned in any of the following circumstances is not

 y Domestic  service  in  a  private  home,  local  college 
club,  or  local  chapter  of  a  college  fraternity  or

*These exemptions are not common. 

Note:  While  the  employer  is  not  required  to  withhold  on 
these amounts, the income is still subject to Ohio income tax 
and school district income tax (if applicable). As such, you 
may  need  to  make  estimated  income  tax  payments  using 
form IT 1040ES and/or estimated school district income tax 
payments using form SD 100ES.

See R.C. 5747.06(A)(1) through (6).
