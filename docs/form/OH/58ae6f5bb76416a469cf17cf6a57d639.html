Maximum medical improvement (MMI) 

(Updates Yes 

  No 

)

MMI	is	a	treatment	plateau	(static	or	well-stabilized)	at	which	no	fundamental	functional	or	physiological	change	can	be	expected	within	
reasonable medical probability, in spite of continuing medical or rehabilitative procedures. Has the work-related injury(s) or occupational 
disease	reached	MMI	based	on	the	definition	above?			Yes	
If	yes,	give	MMI	date:	______/______/______.	If	no,	please	provide	the	proposed	treatment	plan,	including	estimated	duration	of	each	
treatment (attach additional sheet if necessary).

  No 

 

Note:	An	injured	worker	may	need	supportive	treatment	to	maintain	his	or	her	level	of	function	after	reaching	MMI.	Thus,	periodic	medical	treatment	
may still be requested and provided.

Vocational rehabilitation 

(Updates Yes 

  No 

)

Vocational rehabilitation is an individualized and voluntary program for an eligible injured worker who needs assistance in safely returning to 
work or in retaining employment. This program can be tailored around an injured worker’s restrictions and may provide job seeking skills or 
necessary retraining. Is the injured worker a candidate for vocational rehabilitation services focusing on return to work?
Yes 

		If	no,	please	explain	why	and	provide	your	recommendations	to	help	the	injured	worker	return	to	employment.

  No

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
