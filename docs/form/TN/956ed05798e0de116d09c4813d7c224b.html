      <pre>Memorial Resolution 
Honorable Ed Reynolds Davies 
November 20, 1931 – November 22, 2021 
 
June 2022 

Ed  Reynolds  Davies  age  90  passed  away  Monday  November  22, 
2021,  from  natural  causes.  He  was  born  at  Saint  Thomas  Hospital  in 
1931 and was a first-generation native Nashvillian. He died at his home– 
2 days after celebrating his 90th birthday with his family. 

Ed graduated high school from The Webb School in Bell Buckle, TN 
in  1949.  Thereafter  he  received  his  undergraduate  degree  from 
Vanderbilt University in 1953 where he was in the NROTC program and 
President of Sigma Chi Fraternity during his senior year. He later earned 
his law degree (LLB) from Vanderbilt University School of Law in 1958 
and served on the Vanderbilt Law Review from 1956-1958. 

Between college and law school, Ed was on active duty in the United 
States  Marine  Corps  as  a  Platoon  Leader,  Anti-Tank  Assault  Platoon, 
Weapons  Company,  Third  Battalion,  Fifth  Marine  Regiment,  First 
Marine Division. He was stationed in Paju-Ri, Korea from 1954-1955. Ed 
continued to serve his country for another 24 years in the Active Reserve, 
Infantry from 1955 to 1979 when he retired with the rank of Lieutenant 
Colonel.  

Ed  spent  his  professional  career  as  a  trial  lawyer  in  Davidson 
County  and  he  was  an  excellent  one  at  that.  He  was  a  3rd  generation 
lawyer - his grandfather, father, and brother were lawyers and judges. 
He was  a  member of  the  Tennessee Bar  Association  and  the  Nashville 
Bar Association and Ed also served two terms on the Board of Directors 
for  the  NBA  (1971-1973;  1977-1979).  Ed  was  elected  by  his  peers  to 
membership as a Fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers in 1985 
and he remained active in that organization until his retirement in 2019. 
 

   

   

   

   

Ed  began  his  career  at  Waller,  Lansden,  Dortch  &  Davis  (1958-
1963) before moving to Boult, Cummings, Conners & Berry (1963-1973) 
and starting his own law firm in 1973 with partners Thomas O.H. Smith, 
Jr.  and  Luther  Cantrell  and  later  with  Jerry  Humphreys  and  former 
Chancellor Carol McCoy. The firm became known as Davies, Humphreys 
& Reese in the 2000s and Ed enjoyed practicing law with two of his sons 
in the firm through the years until he retired in 2019. 

n May 29, 1974, Ed was appointed by Governor Winfield Dunn to 
fill the unexpired term of Chancellor Frank F. Drowota, III as Chancellor 
of Part II of the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee. He took 
a leave of absence from his private practice to serve briefly as Chancellor 
of  Part  II  until  his  term  of  office  expired  on  September  1,  1974.  After 
Davidson County Democratic politics intervened and he did not receive 
the party’s nomination, Ed was urged to run as an independent candidate 
but declined to do so to prevent Ben Cantrell (the other Davidson County 
Chancellor) from facing an opponent in the general election. 

hough  his  service  as  a  Davidson  County  Chancellor  was  short-
lived,  Ed  was  well-liked  and  respected  as  a  judge  by  members  of  the 
Nashville Bar and by those who appeared before him. He was known for 
being fair, his thoughtful and well-researched decisions, and his excellent 
judicial demeanor. 

Ed was preceded in death by his father United States District Judge 
Elmer David Davies, his mother Luda Reynolds Davies, his Grandfather 
Judge J. E. Reynolds of Arcadia, LA, and his brother Circuit Judge Elmer 
D. Davies, Jr. of Williamson County, TN. Ed is survived by his loving wife 
of 68 years Elizabeth (Betty) Burns Davies; his three “boys” – all of whom 
followed  in  Ed’s  footsteps  by  becoming  4th  generation  lawyers  -  Ed 
Reynolds Davies, Jr. (Dena) of Nashville, Robert Rankin Davies (Lisa) of 
Nashville,  and  Wade  Vance  Davies  (Bethany  Hallam)  of  Knoxville;  7 
grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews 
some of whom are also lawyers and judges, including Senior Judge Robert 
E. Lee Davies of Franklin. 
 

THEREFORE,  BE  IT  RESOLVED  by  the  Tennessee  Judicial 
Conference  that  the  foregoing  Memorial  Resolution  in  honor  of Ed  R. 

   

  O

  T

Davies here be entered on the minutes of this conference, that a copy be 
furnished  to  West  Publishing  Company  for  inclusion  in  Tennessee 
Decisions  and  BE  IT  FURTHER  RESOLVED  that  copies  thereof  be 
furnished to members of his family. 

espectfully submitted this 15th day of June, 2022. 

UDGE JOE P. BINKLEY, JR.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
