      <pre>TENNESSEE 
SUPREME COURT
ACCESS TO JUSTICE 
COMMISSION
2018-2022
STRATEGIC PLAN
2020 Update

Executive Summary

The Tennessee Supreme Court Access to Justice Commission (the “ATJ Commission”) 
operates under the guidance of Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 50 which requires it to 
develop new strategic priorities every two years.  This document is the ATJ Commission’s 
sixth strategic plan.  It outlines new projects, ideas, and programs that carry forward the 
Commission’s vision to provide collaborative leadership to create solutions and resources that 
address and eliminate barriers to justice for all.  

The ATJ Commission will continue to support and boost effective and thriving projects and 
initiatives, such as the Tennessee Faith and Justice Alliance, #Help4TNDay, Pro Bono and 
Faith Days, Pro Bono Recognition, Plain Language Forms, ATJ Fund Distributions, the Justice 
For All website, and other long-standing programs. It will also continue to elevate the work 
and successes of its equal justice community partners.  

Process

The ATJ Commission engaged in a strategic planning process in the spring of 2018.  In 
January of 2020 the Commission reviewed and updated the plan. The process included 
surveying key stakeholders, and a daylong planning session with current and incoming 
commissioners.  Questions identified that needed to be address were: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

How to make our work sustainable and growing?
How do we ensure attorneys understand the need for legal services?
How are we measuring success?
What can/can't people do on their own?
How to build user-centered solutions?
How to get input from judges?
How to understand our opposition?
How to track and measure?

Supreme Court Access to Justice Commission | Strategic Plan | 2020 UpdateIdentify and Eliminate Barriers 
to Racial and Ethnic Fairness

The ATJ Commission held a special meeting in June 2020 to discuss its role in response 
to events in Tennessee and begin conversations about racism in the justice system and the 
importance of assuring the public of the judiciary’s commitment to access, fairness, and 
justice for all.  Subsequently, the Tennessee Supreme Court issued a statement declaring 
that racism still exists and has no place in our society.  The Tennessee Supreme Court 
tapped the ATJ Commission to lead the search for and advise the Court about how to 
accomplish change in areas of education and training, our judicial environment, and court 
policies and procedures that in any way lead to racial bias.   

The ATJ Commission’s mission calls upon it to provide collaborative leadership to create 
solutions and resources to ensure access to justice FOR ALL.  Now is the time for the ATJ 
Commission to hold itself accountable to its mission.  Going forward, the ATJ Commission 
will address issues of racism and disparate impact on racial and ethnic minorities head on.  
The ATJ Commission’s initial action steps are set out below and existing programs, projects, 
and initiatives will be reviewed and modified accordingly. 

• 
 
 
 
• 
 
 
• 
 
 
 
 
• 
 
 
 
 

 

Develop live virtual training on implicit bias, racial injustice, poverty, and related  
topics for the entire judiciary  that will be held quarterly beginning in the Fall of 2020.   
All participants in the judicial system will be invited to participate in these training  
events.  
Modify Committee Workshop event for October 2020 to focus on racial injustice, 
include an implicit bias training, and a possible poverty simulation.  All members of  
the Commission will participate in this training in some form.  
Develop and host Virtual Town Halls to bring together local judges, court clerks, court  
personnel, lawyers, advocates, faith leaders, and community members to discuss racial  
injustice and develop action steps to address these issues and initiate change and trust. 
The ATJ Commission’s Pro Bono and Faith-Based Initiatives Committees will  
spearhead this work.
Use the expertise of the ATJ Commission’s Public Awareness Committee to vet and
create  publicity around issues of racial injustice.  Potential initiatives include a series  
highlighting black and brown leaders in Tennessee’s judicial and legal system, access to  
justice landscape, and communities and faith organizations.  The Committee’s work  
will include social media and traditional content.  

 

As the Tennessee Supreme Court stated, “Change is needed and only can happen through 
listening, as well as valuing and respecting a myriad of voices with different perspectives 
and views.”  The ATJ Commission will adopt this role as set out by the Court to ensure that 
the people of Tennessee receive equal protection of its laws.
