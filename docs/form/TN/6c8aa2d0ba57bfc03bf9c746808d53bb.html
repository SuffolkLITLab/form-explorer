delivered over a suggested timeframe including integration of existing systems, if 
recommended, and high-level tasks and key success factors to be measurable.

Background: 

In 2010, the Supreme Court of Tennessee authorized the implementation of electronic filing 
systems in the civil trial courts of Tennessee. The other state trial courts (criminal, juvenile 
and general sessions) in Tennessee were authorized to implement eFiling in 2016. All eFiling 

RFP # AOC-30227-2022-0001 Amendment #1  
 

3 | P a g e  

 

 

systems being implemented in Tennessee courts are required to meet technological 
standards promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court established a committee 
in 2010 whose responsibility was, among other things, to develop the necessary 
technological standards for eFiling and to review applications by trial courts for 
implementation of electronic filing systems. An initial set of eFiling standards was adopted by 
the Supreme Court in September 2011. In 2011, the Shelby County Circuit and Chancery 
Courts contracted with Tybera Development Group, Inc. (Tybera) to configure and install an 
eFiling system, and in 2012, those courts were the first courts in Tennessee to begin using 
an eFiling system. 

Funding of eFiling systems in the state trial courts of Tennessee is handled at the county 
level. Legislation was passed in 2016 (TCA §8-21-401(o)) permitting clerks to charge a filing 
fee for the purpose of recouping the cost of implementing and maintaining an eFiling system. 
The permitted filing fees includes a charge of up to $5.00 per filing but is limited to $50.00 per 
case for each filer.  As an alternative, the clerk is permitted to allow filers to pay a 
subscription fee of up to $300 per year. The trial courts in the two largest counties in 
Tennessee that have implemented eFiling systems do not charge fees to their users (with 
one court exception) while the other trial courts in the state that have implemented eFiling do 
charge fees at the maximum rate provided by statute. 

To date, data collection, analysis and dissemination is in no way associated with the eFiling 
systems that have been implemented in the state. Each county and court collects, maintains, 
and reports data pursuant to the technological capabilities of the court. The AOC has 
developed some reporting requirements and systems for certain data reporting but there are 
no unified digital systems. Although not all, much of the data collection is handled by the case 
management systems used by the different courts. TnCIS is the case management system 
that is in use, by some or all of the courts, in approximately 91 of the 95 counties. The TnCIS 
case management system is currently partially integrated with only one vendor’s eFiling 
system and further integration is anticipated as TnCIS is upgraded in its capabilities. The 
courts that do not use TnCIS use a variety of different case management and document 
management systems and integrate based on their different system’s capabilities. 

While significant progress has been made, the decision to move to eFiling is made at the 
county level - court by court. Currently there are 11 courts in Tennessee that are utilizing 
eFiling systems and 20 additional courts that have been approved for implementation of an 
eFiling system. There are over 300 courts in the state. There are currently three vendors that 
have been pre-certified for providing eFiling services in Tennessee although pre-certification 
is not required. One of those pre-certified vendors provides eFiling service to the Appellate 
Courts, one vendor provides eFiling service to a single trial court and the third vendor 
provides eFiling service to all of the other courts that are currently using or are in the process 
of implementing eFiling with the exception of one court that has developed its own eFiling 
system. Each court has flexibility in the configuration and use of the eFiling system 
implemented for their court. An anticipated benefit of a statewide standard system would be 
standardized processes, data collection and analysis. 

An eFiling solution, as contemplated by the State of Tennessee, shall provide more services than 
simply providing a means for the transfer of a document to the courts electronically. It includes 
the notion that if designed and implemented uniformly, the data and metadata that is transmitted 
through the system and populates a court’s case management system can produce a robust 
comprehensive collection of statewide court system data. Therefore, uniform statewide eFiling 
potentially provides the foundation for accurate and reliable information gathering and 
dissemination. In a mature statewide eFiling environment, data can be reported and analyzed in 
ways that informs quality policy decision-making for the State.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
