Background:   
In 2010, the Supreme Court of Tennessee authorized the implementation of electronic filing systems in 
the civil trial courts of Tennessee.  The other state trial courts (criminal, juvenile and general sessions) in 
Tennessee were authorized to implement eFiling in 2016.  All eFiling systems being implemented in 
Tennessee courts are required to meet technological standards promulgated by the Supreme Court.  The 
Supreme Court established a committee in 2010 whose responsibility was, among other things, to 
develop the necessary technological standards for eFiling and to review applications by trial courts for 
implementation of electronic filing systems.  An initial set of eFiling standards was adopted by the 
Supreme Court in September 2011.  In 2011, the Shelby County Circuit and Chancery Courts contracted 
with Tybera Development Group, Inc. (Tybera) to configure and install an eFiling system, and in 2012, 
those courts were the first courts in Tennessee to begin using an eFiling system.  

Funding of eFiling systems in the state trial courts of Tennessee is handled at the county level.  
Legislation was passed in 2016 (TCA §8-21-401(o)) permitting clerks to charge a filing fee for the purpose 
of recouping the cost of implementing and maintaining an eFiling system.  The permitted filing fees 
includes a charge of up to $5.00 per filing but is limited to $50.00 per case for each filer.  As an 
alternative, the clerk is permitted to allow filers to pay a subscription fee of up to $300 per year.  The trial

courts in the two largest counties in Tennessee that have implemented eFiling systems do not charge 
fees to their users (with one court exception) while the other trial courts in the state that have 
implemented eFiling do charge fees at the maximum rate provided by statute. 

To date, data collection, analysis and dissemination is in no way associated with the eFiling systems that 
have been implemented in the state.  Each county and court collects, maintains, and reports data 
pursuant to the technological capabilities of the court.  The AOC has developed some reporting 
requirements and systems for certain data reporting but there are no unified digital systems.  Although not 
all, much of the data collection is handled by the case management systems used by the different courts.  
TnCIS is the case management system that is in use, by some or all of the courts, in approximately 91 of 
the 95 counties.  The TnCIS case management system is currently partially integrated with only one 
vendor’s eFiling system and further integration is anticipated as TnCIS is upgraded in its capabilities.  The 
courts that do not use TnCIS use a variety of different case management and document management 
systems and integrate based on their different system’s capabilities.      

While significant progress has been made, the decision to move to eFiling is made at the county level - 
court by court.   Currently there are 11 courts in Tennessee that are utilizing eFiling systems and 20 
additional courts that have been approved for implementation of an eFiling system.  There are over 300 
courts in the state.  There are currently three vendors that have been pre-certified for providing eFiling 
services in Tennessee although pre-certification is not required.  One of those pre-certified vendors 
provides eFiling service to the Appellate Courts, one vendor provides eFiling service to a single trial court 
and the third vendor provides eFiling service to all of the other courts that are currently using or are in the 
process of implementing eFiling with the exception of one court that has developed its own eFiling 
system. Each court has flexibility in the configuration and use of the eFiling system implemented for their 
court. An anticipated benefit of a statewide standard system would be standardized processes, data 
collection and analysis. 

An eFiling solution, as contemplated by the State of Tennessee, shall provide more services than simply 
providing a means for the transfer of a document to the courts electronically.  It includes the notion that if 
designed and implemented uniformly, the data and metadata that is transmitted through the system and 
populates a court’s case management system can produce a robust comprehensive collection of 
statewide court system data. Therefore, uniform statewide eFiling potentially provides the foundation for 
accurate and reliable information gathering and dissemination.  In a mature statewide eFiling 
environment, data can be reported and analyzed in ways that informs quality policy decision-making for 
the State.

OTICE:  A technical response must not include any pricing or cost information.  

If any pricing or cost information amounts of any type (even pricing relating to 
other projects) is included in any part of the technical response, the state may 
deem the response to be non-responsive and reject it. 

3.1.1.1.  A Respondent should duplicate and use the RFP Attachment 6.2., Technical Response 

& Evaluation Guide to organize, reference, and draft the Technical Response by 
duplicating the attachment, adding appropriate page numbers as required, and using 
the guide as a table of contents covering the Technical Response. 

3.1.1.2.  A response should be economically prepared, with emphasis on completeness and 
clarity.  A response, as well as any reference material presented, must be written in

responsive counteroffer and reject it. 

3.3.2.  A response must not restrict the rights of the State or otherwise qualify either the offer to deliver 
goods or provide services as required by this RFP or the Cost Proposal.  If a response restricts

as required by this RFP or the Cost Proposal, the State, at its sole discretion, may determine the 
response to be a non-responsive counteroffer and reject it. 

3.3.3.  A response must not propose alternative goods or services (i.e., offer services different from

collusion between Respondents.  The State will reject any Cost Proposal that involves collusion, 
consultation, communication, or agreement between Respondents.  Regardless of the time of 
detection, the State will consider any such actions to be grounds for response rejection or 
contract termination. 

3.3.5.  A Respondent must not provide, for consideration in this RFP process or subsequent contract 
negotiations, any information that the Respondent knew or should have known was materially 
incorrect.  If the State determines that a Respondent has provided such incorrect information, the 
State will deem the Response non-responsive and reject it.

salary, termination pay, and annual leave has been paid;  

3.3.8.2. A contract with or a response from a company, corporation, or any other contracting 

entity in which a controlling interest is held by any State employee shall be considered to

3.3.8.3. A contract with or a response from a company, corporation, or any other contracting 
entity that employs an individual who is, or within the past six (6) months has been, a 
State employee shall not be considered a contract with or a proposal from the employee 
and shall not constitute a prohibited conflict of interest.

The Oral Presentations are mandatory.  The Solicitation Coordinator will 
schedule Respondent Presentations during the period indicated by the 
RFP Section 2, Schedule of Events.  The Solicitation Coordinator will 
make every effort to accommodate each Respondent’s schedules.  
When the Respondent Presentation schedule has been determined, the 
Solicitation Coordinator will contact Respondents with the relevant 
information as indicated by RFP Section 2, Schedule of Events. 

Respondent Presentations are only open to the invited Respondent, 
Proposal Evaluation Team members, the Solicitation Coordinator, and 
any technical consultants who are selected by the State to provide 
assistance to the Proposal Evaluation Team. 

Oral Presentations provide an opportunity for Respondents to explain 
and clarify their responses and for the State to test to better understand 
the practical application of the good or service as applicable.  
Respondents must not materially alter their responses and Presentations 
will be limited to addressing the items detailed in RFP Attachment 6.2., 
Technical Response & Evaluation Guide.  Respondent pricing shall not 
be discussed or provided during Oral Presentations.

document the determination. 

.2.2.  Cost Proposal Evaluation.  The Solicitation Coordinator will open for evaluation the Cost 
Proposal of each Respondent deemed by the State to be responsive and responsible and 
calculate and record each Cost Proposal score in accordance with the RFP Attachment 6.3., Cost 
Proposal & Scoring Guide. 

5.2.3.  Clarifications and Negotiations. The State reserves the right to award a contract on the 

basis of initial responses received, therefore, each response shall contain the Respondent’s 
best terms and conditions from a technical and cost standpoint.  The State reserves the right to 
conduct clarifications or negotiations with one or more Respondents.  All communications, 
clarifications, and negotiations shall be conducted in a manner that supports fairness in 
response improvement. 

5.2.3.1. Clarifications: The State may identify areas of a response that may require further 

clarification or areas in which it is apparent that there may have been miscommunications 
or misunderstandings as to the State’s specifications or requirements.  The State may 
seek to clarify those issues identified during one or multiple clarification rounds.  Each 
clarification sought by the State may be unique to an individual Respondent, provided that 
the process is conducted in a manner that supports fairness in response improvement. 

5.2.3.2. Negotiations: The State may elect to negotiate with one or more Respondents by 
requesting revised responses, negotiating costs, or finalizing contract terms and 
conditions.  The State reserves the right to conduct multiple negotiation rounds or no 
negotiations at all. 

5.2.3.3. Cost Negotiations:  All Respondents, selected for negotiation by the State, will be given 

equivalent information with respect to cost negotiations.  All cost negotiations will be 
documented for the procurement file.  Additionally, the State may conduct target pricing 
and other goods or services level negotiations.  Target pricing may be based on 
considerations such as current pricing, market considerations, benchmarks, budget 
availability, or other methods that do not reveal individual Respondent pricing.  During 
target price negotiations, Respondents are not obligated to reduce their pricing to target 
prices, but no Respondent is allowed to increase prices.   

5.2.3.4. If the State determines that it is unable to successfully negotiate terms and conditions of a 

contract with the apparent best evaluated Respondent, the State reserves the right to 
bypass the apparent best evaluated Respondent and enter into terms and conditions 
contract negotiations with the next apparent best evaluated Respondent.  

.2.4.  Total Response Score.  The Solicitation Coordinator will calculate the sum of the Technical 

Response section scores and the Cost Proposal score and record the resulting number as the 
total score for the subject Response (refer to RFP Attachment 6.5., Score Summary Matrix).

5.3.3.  The State will issue a Notice of Intent to Award identifying the apparent best-evaluated response 

and make the RFP files available for public inspection at the time and date specified in the RFP 
Section 2, Schedule of Events. 

5.3.4.  The Respondent identified as offering the apparent best-evaluated response must sign a contract 

drawn by the State pursuant to this RFP.  The Contract shall be substantially the same as the 
RFP Attachment 6.6., Pro Forma Contract.  The Respondent must sign the contract by the 
Contractor Signature Deadline detailed in the RFP Section 2, Schedule of Events.  If the 
Respondent fails to provide the signed Contract by this deadline, the State may determine that 
the Respondent is non-responsive to this RFP and reject the response. 

5.3.5.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the State may, at its sole discretion, entertain limited terms and 
conditions or pricing negotiations prior to Contract signing and, as a result, revise the pro forma 
contract terms and conditions or performance requirements in the State’s best interests, 
PROVIDED THAT such revision of terms and conditions or performance requirements shall NOT 
materially affect the basis of response evaluations or negatively impact the competitive nature of 
the RFP and contractor selection process. 

5.3.6. 

If the State determines that a response is non-responsive and rejects it after opening Cost 
Proposals, the Solicitation Coordinator will re-calculate scores for each remaining responsive 
Cost Proposal to determine (or re-determine) the apparent best-evaluated response.

shall be the prime contractor and responsible for compliance with all terms and conditions of this 
Contract.  The State reserves the right to request additional information or impose additional 
terms and conditions before approving an assignment of this Contract in whole or in part or the 
use of subcontractors in fulfilling the Contractor’s obligations under this Contract.

be paid directly or indirectly to an employee or official of the State of Tennessee as wages,

Tennessee or if the Contractor is an entity in which a controlling interest is held by an individual 
who is, or within the past six (6) months has been, an employee of the State of Tennessee.

excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination 
in the performance of this Contract or in the employment practices of the Contractor on the 
grounds of handicap or disability, age, race, creed, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any 
other classification protected by federal or state law.  The Contractor shall, upon request, show 
proof of nondiscrimination and shall post in conspicuous places, available to all employees and 
applicants, notices of nondiscrimination. 

.10.  Prohibition of Illegal Immigrants.  The requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. §12-3-309 addressing 

the use of illegal immigrants in the performance of any contract to supply goods or services to the 
state of Tennessee, shall be a material provision of this Contract, a breach of which shall be 
grounds for monetary and other penalties, up to and including termination of this Contract. 

The Contractor agrees that the Contractor shall not knowingly utilize the services of an 
illegal immigrant in the performance of this Contract and shall not knowingly utilize the 
services of any subcontractor who will utilize the services of an illegal immigrant in the 
performance of this Contract.  The Contractor shall reaffirm this attestation, in writing, by 
submitting to the State a completed and signed copy of the document at Attachment A 
semi-annually during the Term.  If the Contractor is a party to more than one contract with 
the State, the Contractor may submit one attestation that applies to all contracts with the 
State.  All Contractor attestations shall be maintained by the Contractor and made 
available to State officials upon request. 

Prior to the use of any subcontractor in the performance of this Contract, and semi-
annually thereafter, during the Term, the Contractor shall obtain and retain a current, 
written attestation that the subcontractor shall not knowingly utilize the services of an 
illegal immigrant to perform work under this Contract and shall not knowingly utilize the 
services of any subcontractor who will utilize the services of an illegal immigrant to 
perform work under this Contract.  Attestations obtained from subcontractors shall be 
maintained by the Contractor and made available to State officials upon request. 

The Contractor shall maintain records for all personnel used in the performance of this 
Contract.  Contractor’s records shall be subject to review and random inspection at any 
reasonable time upon reasonable notice by the State. 

The Contractor understands and agrees that failure to comply with this section will be 
subject to the sanctions of Tenn. Code Ann. §12-3-309 for acts or omissions occurring 
after its effective date.  

For purposes of this Contract, "illegal immigrant" shall be defined as any person who is 
not: (i) a United States citizen; (ii) a Lawful Permanent Resident; (iii) a person whose 
physical presence in the United States is authorized; (iv) allowed by the federal 
Department of Homeland Security and who, under federal immigration laws or 
regulations, is authorized to be employed in the U.S.; or (v) is otherwise authorized to

State, the Comptroller of the Treasury, or their duly appointed representatives.  The financial 
statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

requested. 

.14.  Strict Performance.  Failure by any Party to this Contract to require, in any one or more cases, 
the strict performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions, or provisions of this Contract 
shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any term, covenant, condition, or 
provision.  No term or condition of this Contract shall be held to be waived, modified, or deleted 
except by a written amendment signed by the Parties. 

Independent Contractor.  The Parties shall not act as employees, partners, joint venturers, or 
associates of one another.  The Parties are independent contracting entities. Nothing in this 
Contract shall be construed to create an employer/employee relationship or to allow either Party 
to exercise control or direction over the manner or method by which the other transacts its 
business affairs or provides its usual services.  The employees or agents of one Party are not 
employees or agents of the other Party. 

.15.

.16  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The Contractor agrees that it will be responsible for 
compliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) with respect to itself 
and its employees, including any obligation to report health insurance coverage, provide health 
insurance coverage, or pay any financial assessment, tax, or penalty for not providing health 
insurance.  The Contractor shall indemnify the State and hold it harmless from any costs to the 
State arising from Contractor’s failure to fulfill its PPACA responsibilities for itself or its 
employees. 
   

 
D.17.  Limitation of State’s Liability.  The State shall have no liability except as specifically provided in 

this Contract.  In no event will the State be liable to the Contractor or any other party for any lost 
revenues, lost profits, loss of business, decrease in the value of any securities or cash position, 
time, goodwill, or any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages 
of any nature, whether based on warranty, contract, statute, regulation, tort (including but not 
limited to negligence), or any other legal theory that may arise under this Contract or otherwise.  
The State’s total liability under this Contract (including any exhibits, schedules, amendments or 
other attachments to the Contract) or otherwise shall under no circumstances exceed the 
Maximum Liability.  This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident.  

.18.  Limitation of Contractor’s Liability. In accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. §12-3-701, the 

Contractor’s liability for all claims arising under this Contract shall be limited to an amount equal 
to two (2) times the Maximum Liability amount detailed in Section C.1. and as may be amended, 
PROVIDED THAT in no event shall this Section limit the liability of the Contractor for: (i) 
intellectual property or any Contractor indemnity obligations for infringement for third-party 
intellectual property rights; (ii) any claims covered by any specific provision in the Contract 
providing for liquidated damages; or (iii) any claims for intentional torts, criminal acts, fraudulent 
conduct, or acts or omissions that result in personal injuries or death.  For clarity, except as 
otherwise expressly set forth in this Section, Contractor’s indemnification obligations and other 
remedies available under this Contract are subject to the limitations on liability set forth in this 
Section. 

D.12.  Monitoring.  The Contractor’s activities conducted and records maintained pursuant to this 
Contract shall be subject to monitoring and evaluation by the State, the Comptroller of the 
Treasury, or their duly appointed representatives.

.19.  Hold Harmless.  The Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the State of Tennessee 

as well as its officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all claims, liabilities, 
losses, and causes of action which may arise, accrue, or result to any person, firm, corporation, 
or other entity which may be injured or damaged as a result of acts, omissions, or negligence on 
the part of the Contractor, its employees, or any person acting for or on its or their behalf relating 
to this Contract.  The Contractor further agrees it shall be liable for the reasonable cost of 
attorneys’ fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses for the State to 
enforce the terms of this Contract. 

8 

n the event of any suit or claim, the Parties shall give each other immediate notice and provide 
all necessary assistance to respond. The failure of the State to give notice shall only relieve the 
Contractor of its obligations under this Section to the extent that the Contractor can demonstrate 
actual prejudice arising from the failure to give notice.  This Section shall not grant the Contractor, 
through its attorneys, the right to represent the State in any legal matter, as the right to represent 
the State is governed by Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-6-106. 

.20.    HIPAA Compliance. The State and Contractor shall comply with obligations under the Health 

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Health Information Technology for 
Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act and any other relevant laws and regulations 
regarding privacy (collectively the “Privacy Rules”).  The obligations set forth in this Section shall 
survive the termination of this Contract. 

Contractor warrants to the State that it is familiar with the requirements of the Privacy 
Rules, and will comply with all applicable requirements in the course of this Contract. 

Contractor warrants that it will cooperate with the State, including cooperation and 
coordination with State privacy officials and other compliance officers required by the 
Privacy Rules, in the course of performance of the Contract so that both parties will be in 
compliance with the Privacy Rules. 

The State and the Contractor will sign documents, including but not limited to business 
associate agreements, as required by the Privacy Rules and that are reasonably 
necessary to keep the State and Contractor in compliance with the Privacy Rules.  This 
provision shall not apply if information received or delivered by the parties under this 
Contract is NOT “protected health information” as defined by the Privacy Rules, or if the 
Privacy Rules permit the parties to receive or deliver the information without entering into 
a business associate agreement or signing another document. 

The Contractor will indemnify the State and hold it harmless for any violation by the 
Contractor or its subcontractors of the Privacy Rules.  This includes the costs of 
responding to a breach of protected health information, the costs of responding to a 
government enforcement action related to the breach, and any fines, penalties, or 
damages paid by the State because of the violation. 

.21.  Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.   Subject to statutory exceptions contained in Tenn. 
Code Ann. §§8-36-801, et seq., the law governing the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement 
System (“TCRS”), provides that if a retired member of TCRS, or of any superseded system 
administered by TCRS, or of any local retirement fund established under Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 8-
35-101, et seq., accepts State employment, the member's retirement allowance is suspended 
during the period of the employment.  Accordingly and notwithstanding any provision of this 
Contract to the contrary, the Contractor agrees that if it is later determined that the true nature of 
the working relationship between the Contractor and the State under this Contract is that of 
“employee/employer” and not that of an independent contractor, the Contractor, if a retired 
member of TCRS, may be required to repay to TCRS the amount of retirement benefits the 
Contractor received from TCRS during the Term. 

.22.  Tennessee Department of Revenue Registration. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable 

registration requirements contained in Tenn. Code Ann. §§67-6-601 – 608.  Compliance with 
applicable registration requirements is a material requirement of this Contract. 

.23.  Debarment and Suspension.  The Contractor certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
it, its current and future principals, its current and future subcontractors and their principals: 

are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or 
voluntarily excluded from covered transactions by any federal or state department or 
agency;

have not within a three (3) year period preceding this Contract been convicted of, or had 
a civil judgment rendered against them from commission of fraud, or a criminal offense in 
connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state, or 
local) transaction or grant under a public transaction; violation of federal or state antitrust 
statutes or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification, or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; 

are not presently indicted or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a government entity 
(federal, state, or local) with commission of any of the offenses detailed in section b. of 
this certification;  and

transactions (federal, state, or local) terminated for cause or default.

he Contractor shall provide immediate written notice to the State if at any time it learns that 
there was an earlier failure to disclose information or that due to changed circumstances, its 
principals or the principals of its subcontractors are excluded, disqualified, or presently fall under 
any of the prohibitions of sections a-d. 

.24.  Force Majeure.   “Force Majeure Event” means fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts 

of God, wars, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, acts of terrorism or any other similar 
cause beyond the reasonable control of the Party except to the extent that the non-performing 
Party is at fault in failing to prevent or causing the default or delay, and provided that the default 
or delay cannot reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of 
alternate sources, workaround plans or other means.  A strike, lockout or labor dispute shall not 
excuse either Party from its obligations under this Contract.  Except as set forth in this Section, 
any failure or delay by a Party in the performance of its obligations under this Contract arising 
from a Force Majeure Event is not a default under this Contract or grounds for termination.  The 
non-performing Party will be excused from performing those obligations directly affected by the 
Force Majeure Event, and only for as long as the Force Majeure Event continues, provided that 
the Party continues to use diligent, good faith efforts to resume performance without delay.  The 
occurrence of a Force Majeure Event affecting Contractor’s representatives, suppliers, 
subcontractors, customers or business apart from this Contract is not a Force Majeure Event 
under this Contract.  Contractor will promptly notify the State of any delay caused by a Force 
Majeure Event (to be confirmed in a written notice to the State within one (1) day of the inception 
of the delay) that a Force Majeure Event has occurred, and will describe in reasonable detail the 
nature of the Force Majeure Event.  If any Force Majeure Event results in a delay in Contractor’s 
performance longer than forty-eight (48) hours, the State may, upon notice to Contractor: (a) 
cease payment of the fees for the affected obligations until Contractor resumes performance of 
the affected obligations; or (b) immediately terminate this Contract or any purchase order, in 
whole or in part, without further payment except for fees then due and payable.  Contractor will 
not increase its charges under this Contract or charge the State any fees other than those 
provided for in this Contract as the result of a Force Majeure Event. 

.25.  State and Federal Compliance.  The Contractor shall comply with all State and federal laws and 

regulations applicable to Contractor in the Contractor’s performance of this Contract. 

.26.  Governing Law.  This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws 

of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its conflict or choice of law rules.  The Tennessee 
Claims Commission or the state or federal courts in Tennessee shall be the venue for all claims, 
disputes, or disagreements arising under this Contract.  The Contractor acknowledges and 
agrees that any rights, claims, or remedies against the State of Tennessee or its employees 
arising under this Contract shall be subject to and limited to those rights and remedies available 
under Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 9-8-101 - 408. 

.27.  Entire Agreement.  This Contract is complete and contains the entire understanding between the 
Parties relating to its subject matter, including all the terms and conditions of the Parties’ 
agreement.  This Contract supersedes any and all prior understandings, representations, 
negotiations, and agreements between the Parties, whether written or oral.

.28.  Severability.  If any terms and conditions of this Contract are held to be invalid or unenforceable 
as a matter of law, the other terms and conditions of this Contract shall not be affected and shall 
remain in full force and effect.  The terms and conditions of this Contract are severable. 

.29.  Headings.  Section headings of this Contract are for reference purposes only and shall not be 

construed as part of this Contract. 

.30. 

Incorporation of Additional Documents.  Each of the following documents is included as a part of 
this Contract by reference.  In the event of a discrepancy or ambiguity regarding the Contractor’s 
duties, responsibilities, and performance under this Contract, these items shall govern in order of 
precedence below:

any amendment to this Contract, with the latter in time controlling over any earlier 
amendments;

any clarifications of or addenda to the Contractor’s proposal seeking this Contract; 
the State solicitation, as may be amended, requesting responses in competition for this 
Contract; 
any technical specifications provided to proposers during the procurement process to 
award this Contract; and 
the Contractor’s response seeking this Contract. 
 

Iran Divestment Act.   The requirements of Tenn. Code Ann. §12-12-101, et seq., addressing 
contracting with persons as defined at Tenn. Code Ann. §12-12-103(5) that engage in investment 
activities in Iran, shall be a material provision of this Contract.  The Contractor certifies, under 
penalty of perjury, that to the best of its knowledge and belief that it is not on the list created 
pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. §12-12-106. 

Insurance.  Contractor shall maintain insurance coverage as specified in this Section. The State 
reserves the right to amend or require additional insurance coverage, coverage amounts, and 
endorsements required under this Contract. Contractor’s failure to maintain or submit evidence of 
insurance coverage, as required, is a material breach of this Contract.  If Contractor loses 
insurance coverage, fails to renew coverage, or for any reason becomes uninsured during the 
Term, Contractor shall immediately notify the State.  All insurance companies providing coverage 
must be: (a) acceptable to the State; (b) authorized by the Tennessee Department of Commerce 
and Insurance (“TDCI”); and (c) rated A- / VII or better by A.M. Best.  All coverage must be on a 
primary basis and noncontributory with any other insurance or self-insurance carried by the State.  
Contractor agrees to name the State as an additional insured on any insurance policy with the 
exception of workers’ compensation (employer liability) and professional liability (errors and 
omissions) insurance. All policies must contain an endorsement for a waiver of subrogation in 
favor of the State.  Any deductible or self-insured retention (“SIR”) over fifty thousand dollars 
($50,000) must be approved by the State.  The deductible or SIR and any premiums are the 
Contractor’s sole responsibility. The Contractor agrees that the insurance requirements specified 
in this Section do not reduce any liability the Contractor has assumed under this Contract 
including any indemnification or hold harmless requirements. 

To achieve the required coverage amounts, a combination of an otherwise deficient specific 
policy and an umbrella policy with an aggregate meeting or exceeding the required coverage 
amounts is acceptable. For example: If the required policy limit under this Contract is for two 
million dollars ($2,000,000) in coverage, acceptable coverage would include a specific policy 
covering one million dollars ($1,000,000) combined with an umbrella policy for an additional one 
million dollars ($1,000,000). If the deficient underlying policy is for a coverage area without 
aggregate limits (generally Automobile Liability and Employers’ Liability Accident), Contractor 
shall provide a copy of the umbrella insurance policy documents to ensure that no aggregate limit 
applies to the umbrella policy for that coverage area.  In the event that an umbrella policy is being 
provided to achieve any required coverage amounts, the umbrella policy shall be accompanied by 
an endorsement at least as broad as the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (also known as “ISO”)

“Noncontributory—Other Insurance Condition” endorsement or shall be written on a policy form 
that addresses both the primary and noncontributory basis of the umbrella policy if the State is 
otherwise named as an additional insured. 

ontractor shall provide the State a certificate of insurance (“COI”) evidencing the coverages and 

amounts specified in this Section.  The COI must be on a form approved by the TDCI (standard 
ACORD form preferred).  The COI must list each insurer’s National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (NAIC) number and be signed by an authorized representative of the insurer. The 
COI must list the State of Tennessee – CPO Risk Manager, 312 Rosa L. Parks Ave., 3rd floor 
Central Procurement Office, Nashville, TN 37243 as the certificate holder.  Contractor shall 
provide the COI ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Date and again thirty (30) calendar 
days before renewal or replacement of coverage.  Contractor shall provide the State evidence 
that all subcontractors maintain the required insurance or that subcontractors are included under 
the Contractor’s policy.  At any time, the State may require Contractor to provide a valid COI.  
The Parties agree that failure to provide evidence of insurance coverage as required is a material 
breach of this Contract.  If Contractor self-insures, then a COI will not be required to prove 
coverage.  Instead Contractor shall provide a certificate of self-insurance or a letter, on 
Contractor’s letterhead, detailing its coverage, policy amounts, and proof of funds to reasonably 
cover such expenses.  The State reserves the right to require complete copies of all required 
insurance policies, including endorsements required by these specifications, at any time.

he State agrees that it shall give written notice to the Contractor as soon as practicable after the 
State becomes aware of any claim asserted or made against the State, but in no event later than 
thirty (30) calendar days after the State becomes aware of such claim. The failure of the State to 
give notice shall only relieve the Contractor of its obligations under this Section to the extent that 
the Contractor can demonstrate actual prejudice arising from the failure to give notice.  This 
Section shall not grant the Contractor or its insurer, through its attorneys, the right to represent 
the State in any legal matter, as the right to represent the State is governed by Tenn. Code Ann. 
§8-6-106. 

The insurance obligations under this Contract shall be: (1)—all the insurance coverage and policy 
limits carried by the Contractor; or (2)—the minimum insurance coverage requirements and policy 
limits shown in this Contract; whichever is greater.  Any insurance proceeds in excess of or 
broader than the minimum required coverage and minimum required policy limits, which are 
applicable to a given loss, shall be available to the State.  No representation is made that the 
minimum insurance requirements of the Contract are sufficient to cover the obligations of the 
Contractor arising under this Contract.  The Contractor shall obtain and maintain, at a minimum, 
the following insurance coverages and policy limits.  

a.  Commercial General Liability (“CGL”) Insurance 

1)  The Contractor shall maintain CGL, which shall be written on an ISO Form CG

and liability assumed under an insured contract (including the tort liability of 
another assumed in a business contract). 

The Contractor shall maintain single limits not less than one million dollars 
($1,000,000) per occurrence.  If a general aggregate limit applies, either the 
general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this policy or location of 
occurrence or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence 
limit.   

b.  Workers’ Compensation and Employer Liability Insurance 

1)  For Contractors statutorily required to carry workers’ compensation and employer 

liability insurance, the Contractor shall maintain: 

12 

i.  Workers’ compensation in an amount not less than one million dollars

per employee for bodily injury by disease. 

 

2)

ii.  The Contractor is a sole proprietor; 

iii.  The Contractor is in the construction business or trades with no 

employees; 

iv.  The Contractor is in the coal mining industry with no employees;

made basis.  If this coverage is written on a claims-made basis, then:  

1. The retroactive date must be shown, and must be on or before the earlier of the 
Effective Date of the Contract or the beginning of Contract work or provision of 
goods and services; 

2. Insurance must be maintained and evidence of insurance must be provided for at 

least five (5) full years from the date of the final Contract payment; and 

3. If coverage is canceled or non-renewed, and not replaced with another claims-
made policy form with a retroactive date on or prior to the Contract Effective

minimum of five (5) full years from the date of the final Contract payment. 

ii. 

Any professional liability insurance policy shall have a limit not less than one million 
dollars ($1,000,000) per claim and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate; and

the extent applicable, the Contractor and the Contractor’s subcontractors shall remit sales and 
use taxes on the sales of goods or services that are made by the Contractor or the Contractor’s 
subcontractors and that are subject to tax.  

.34.  Confidentiality of Records. Strict standards of confidentiality of records and information shall be 

maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal law.  All material and information, 
regardless of form, medium or method of communication, provided to the Contractor by the State 
or acquired by the Contractor on behalf of the State that is regarded as confidential under state or 
federal law shall be regarded as “Confidential Information.”  Nothing in this Section shall permit 
Contractor to disclose any Confidential Information, regardless of whether it has been disclosed 
or made available to the Contractor due to intentional or negligent actions or inactions of agents 
of the State or third parties.  Confidential Information shall not be disclosed except as required or 
permitted under state or federal law.  Contractor shall take all necessary steps to safeguard the 
confidentiality of such material or information in conformance with applicable state and federal 
law.    

              
             The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive the termination of this Contract.

will not, for the duration of the Contract, engage in a Boycott of Israel, as that term is defined in 
Public Chapter No. 775.

Conflicting Terms and Conditions.  Should any of these special terms and conditions conflict with 
any other terms and conditions of this Contract, the special terms and conditions shall be 
subordinate to the Contract’s other terms and conditions.  

he Contractor shall assist the State in monitoring the Contractor’s performance of this 

commitment by providing, as requested, a monthly report of participation in the performance of 
this Contract by small business enterprises and businesses owned by minorities, women, service-
disabled veterans, and persons with disabilities.  Such reports shall be provided to the State of

Additional lines, items, or options.  At its sole discretion, the State may make written requests to 
the Contractor to add lines, items, or options that are needed and within the Scope but were not 
included in the original Contract. Such lines, items, or options will be added to the Contract 
through a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”), not an amendment.

a.  After the Contractor receives a written request to add lines, items, or options, the Contractor 

shall have ten (10) business days to respond with a written proposal. The Contractor’s written 
proposal shall include: 

(1)  The effect, if any, of adding the lines, items, or options on the other goods or services 

required under the Contract; 

(2)  Any pricing related to the new lines, items, or options; 
(3)  The expected effective date for the availability of the new lines, items, or options; and 
(4)  Any additional information requested by the State. 

b.  The State may negotiate the terms of the Contractor’s proposal by requesting revisions to the 

proposal. 

c.  To indicate acceptance of a proposal, the State will sign it. The signed proposal shall 

constitute a MOU between the Parties, and the lines, items, or options shall be incorporated 
into the Contract as if set forth verbatim. 

d.  Only after a MOU has been executed shall the Contractor perform or deliver the new lines, 

items, or options.  

Intellectual Property Indemnity.  The Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the State 
of Tennessee as well as its officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all claims 
or suits which may be brought against the State concerning or arising out of any claim of an 
alleged patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property infringement.  In any such 
claim or action brought against the State, the Contractor shall satisfy and indemnify the State for 
the amount of any settlement or final judgment, and the Contractor shall be responsible for all 
legal or other fees or expenses incurred by the State arising from any such claim. The State shall 
give the Contractor notice of any such claim or suit, however, the failure of the State to give such 
notice shall only relieve Contractor of its obligations under this Section to the extent Contractor 
can demonstrate actual prejudice arising from the State’s failure to give notice. This Section shall 
not grant the Contractor, through its attorneys, the right to represent the State of Tennessee in 
any legal matter, as provided in Tenn. Code Ann.  §8-6-106. 

Extraneous Terms and Conditions.  Contractor shall fill all orders submitted by the State under 
this Contract.  No purchase order, invoice, or other documents associated with any sales, orders, 
or supply of any good or service under this Contract shall contain any terms or conditions other 
than as set forth in the Contract.  Any such extraneous terms and conditions shall be void, invalid 
and unenforceable against the State.  Any refusal by Contractor to supply any goods or services 
under this Contract conditioned upon the State submitting to any extraneous terms and conditions 
shall be a material breach of the Contract and constitute an act of bad faith by Contractor.   

Partial Takeover of Contract.  The State may, at its convenience and without cause, exercise a 
partial takeover of any service that the Contractor is obligated to perform under this Contract, 
including any service which is the subject of a subcontract between Contractor and a third party 
(a “Partial Takeover”).  A Partial Takeover of this Contract by the State shall not be deemed a 
breach of contract.  The Contractor shall be given at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of a 
Partial Takeover.  The notice shall specify the areas of service the State will assume and the date 
the State will be assuming.   The State’s exercise of a Partial Takeover shall not alter the 
Contractor’s other duties and responsibilities under this Contract.   The State reserves the right to 
withhold from the Contractor any amounts the Contractor would have been paid but for the 
State’s exercise of a Partial Takeover.  The amounts shall be withheld effective as of the date the 
State exercises its right to a Partial Takeover.   The State’s exercise of its right to a Partial 
Takeover of this Contract shall not entitle the Contractor to any actual, general, special, 
incidental, consequential, or any other damages irrespective of any description or amount.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
