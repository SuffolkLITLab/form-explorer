      <pre>Getting Started with Zoom and Using it Securely  
by Sharon D. Nelson, Esq. and John W. Simek 
© 2020 Sensei Enterprises, Inc. 

he coronavirus pandemic has forced a lot of lawyers to utilize video conferencing to “meet” 
with co-workers and clients. One of the more popular video conferencing platforms is Zoom. 
There are others, but we see Zoom being used the most, especially among solo and small firm 
lawyers. While we can’t cover all the options and settings for Zoom, we’ll try to give our advice 
on the best way to use and secure Zoom for your firm. 

asics 

The first question is…what the heck is this thing called Zoom? According to the website, “Zoom 
is the leader in modern enterprise video communications, with an easy, reliable cloud platform 
for video and audio conferencing, collaboration, chat, and webinars across mobile devices, 
desktops, telephones, and room systems. Zoom Rooms is the original software-based 
conference room solution used around the world in board, conference, huddle, and training 
rooms, as well as executive offices and classrooms.” 

oom is extremely easy to use and is available across multiple platforms and operating systems. 
You can use your mobile device with apps available for Android and iOS. There are desktop 
clients available for macOS, Windows and a bunch of Linux/Unix versions (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux, 
CentOS, OpenSUSE, etc.). 

quipment 
To state the obvious, you will need some sort of camera to participate in a video conference 
call. Most modern-day laptops are equipped with a webcam for video calls. You could even use 
your iPad or smartphone with Zoom. Another consideration is sound. The built-in microphones 
for laptops or phones don’t sound particularly good if you are on the receiving end. Consider 
using a headset (with microphone) or earbuds. You’ll be able to hear better, and so will all the 
other participants. 

on’t forget where you physically sit during the video conference. If your back is to an open 
window, the brightness may make you difficult to see. Objects behind you may be distracting 
too. Think about what the person on the other end is seeing. Be cognizant of those around you 
too. Family members may be able to hear you discussing confidential information even if you 
are wearing a headset. 

eatures 
The primary function of Zoom is to facilitate video conferencing. It supports video and audio 
transmission for each connected user over the internet. There’s also a dial-in number for audio 
only connections. Some people use Zoom as an audio conference bridge so that users won’t 
have to incur potential long-distance phone charges.

You can also configure Zoom to allow file transfers and screen sharing. Screen sharing is very 
common when observing a product demo. It is even used when giving a webinar. The presenter 
can mute all the attendees and share their PowerPoint slides from their computer desktop. 
There is also a whiteboard feature where participants can annotate for all to see. 

here are a lot of meeting controls available to the host. As an example, you can control the 
audio of the participants. All participants can be muted when they first join the meeting. 
Audible tones can “announce” the joining of a participant. Sessions can be recorded. There is 
even an option to let you know if a participant is not paying attention.  

nother helpful feature for mediators is the Breakout Room feature. You create the rooms and 

then assign participants to a specific room. When the host opens the breakout rooms, each 
participant gets a notice to move to the room. Each room is isolated from the others, just like 
you would be in a real mediation. The participants can take advantage of the Zoom features 
(e.g. screen share, chat, etc.) among everyone in the room. The host and co-host can freely 
move among the breakout rooms. However, that feature only works for the host at this time. 
The co-host must be assigned a room, but the host can move them among the various rooms as 
needed. 

There is a free version of Zoom, but there is a 40-minute limit per meeting that has three or 
more participants. The Pro version is the most popular for solo and small firm attorneys. The 
cost is $14.99/month per host account. (The host is the one who schedules the meeting.) Each 
session is limited to 24 hours (don’t invite us) and you can have up to 100 participants. There 
are additional admin controls as well. If you pay annually, the cost is $149.90 ($12.49/month). 
The next level up is the Business subscription, which is $19.99/month per host and requires a 
minimum of 10 hosts. There are a lot of enterprise features available with the Business plan 
such as a vanity URL and the ability for on-premise deployment. 

e’re confident the Pro plan is more than adequate for most law firms. If you need more than 

one host, just purchase an additional Pro plan subscription. 

onfiguration Settings 

We’re not going to go through all the various ways you can use or control Zoom. Assuming you 
have purchased a Zoom subscription, we will make some suggestions for configuring and using 
Zoom in a more secure fashion. First off, make sure you are using the most up-to-date version 
of Zoom. If you have previously used Zoom, you probably already have Zoom installed. To 
manually download the latest version, launch the Zoom application, log in to Zoom and click on 
your user icon in the upper right (it probably has your initials). Select “Check for Updates” and 
follow the instructions. 

onsider changing some of the default settings prior to scheduling the meeting. The first one is 
screen sharing. The default is to allow all participants to screen share. That means anyone can

share their screen with inappropriate content. Yes, even bizarre sexual content. You definitely 
want to change the default to set screen sharing to host only.  

nother setting is to require a meeting password. You can configure Zoom to include the 

password in the meeting invite or you can distribute the password separately. A related default 
password setting is to require a password for those joining by phone as well. Once all the 
intended participants have joined, close the meeting. You do this by selecting “Manage 
Participants” and then click “More” at the bottom of the panel. Select the “Lock Meeting” to 
prevent anybody else from joining. As you can see, the intent is to create as many barriers as 
possible to prevent unintended attendance to your meeting. So-called “trolls” having a way of 
joining for mischievous reasons without those barriers. 

t would be nice if everyone in the meeting used their video cameras so you could verify who 
they are. However, some participants may not want their cameras turned on or they call in 
using a telephone. There is another Zoom setting to prevent someone from changing their 
display name to indicate they are someone else. When you are in the meeting, go back to the 
managing participants panel and click on “More” again. Make sure that the “Allow Participants 
to Rename Themselves” is unchecked. 

n additional step to prevent the display of inappropriate content is disabling virtual 

backgrounds. Go to the “Setting” section in Zoom and select the In “Meeting (Advanced)” 
choice. Disable the “Virtual background” option. This will prevent someone from displaying an 
inappropriate image as their background. 

ontrol when the meeting starts. Don’t let the participants join the meeting before you do. 
Who knows what could be going on before you connect? In the “Schedule Meeting” section of 
“Settings,” turn off the “Join before host” option. 

f you are particularly paranoid about what someone might pop up or write on a screen, you 
should turn off annotations and whiteboard in the “In Meeting (Basic)” section. 

onsider turning on “Allow host to put attendee on hold” in the “In Meeting (Basic)” section.  
This will allow you kick people out of the meeting if necessary. Hopefully, you won’t have to do 
that, but it’s a good idea to have the option if needed. 

cheduling 
It is highly recommended NOT to use your Personal Meeting ID (PMI) when scheduling 
meetings. Your PMI is a constant value and never changes. Once it is known to someone they 
could connect to the meeting whether they have been invited or not. Of course, requiring a 
password for PMI meetings will help, but our recommendation is to not use PMI - period. 
Allowing Zoom to automatically generate the meeting ID is a more secure option. This means 
that each scheduled meeting will have a unique meeting ID.

Account Security 
Just like any other service you use, your password should be strong and not easily guessed. In 
addition, two-factor authentication (2FA) should be enabled. It still amazes us that the default 
is not set to require 2FA. You enable 2FA by selecting “Security” in the “Admin” section, under 
“Advanced.” Turn on the “Sign in with Two-Factor Authentication” option. 

rivacy 

  P

You need to understand that Zoom is constantly being criticized for its collection of data. It’s 
rare that we come across an attorney that has actually read the Terms of Service, Acceptable 
Use or Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service for Zoom is thirteen pages, which may take you a 
little time to plow through. The interesting thing is that Zoom just updated its privacy policy on 
March 18, 2020. Coincidence or was it in response to the sudden spike in users flocking to 
Zoom? 

ottom line…Zoom collects a lot of data from users about their devices, activities and data 

shared/transferred. Consumer Reports pointed out that advertising campaigns could be 
developed from the videos and chat messages. Like Facebook, Zoom could use facial 
recognition technology against all the recorded videos. 

 major difference with Zoom is the amount of control hosts have over participants and their 
activities. We’ve already discussed some of the recommended configuration settings to restrict 
what participants can do. Director of privacy and technology policy at Consumer Reports, Justin 
Brookman, said, “Zoom puts a lot of power in the hands of the meeting hosts. The host has 
more power to record and monitor the call than you might realize if you’re just a participant, 
especially if he or she has a corporate account.” 

nother Zoom criticism is the ability to determine if attendees are paying attention. There is an 

“Attention tracking” setting that monitors when a participant has clicked focus away from the 
Zoom window for more than 30 seconds. Some users call it the “boss is watching” feature to 
see if you are doing other things while your boss is pontificating. 

inal Words 
Zoom has become extremely popular. It is extremely easy to use even for those less technically 
inclined. Performance is good and there are lots of features to use. There are also features that 
can go awry. Spend a little time to become familiar with the capabilities of Zoom, especially if 
you are the one hosting the meetings.
