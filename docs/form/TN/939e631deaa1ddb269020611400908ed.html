Introduction 

In August 2008, the Tennessee Supreme Court declared Access to Justice its number-

one strategic priority. Later that year, the Court launched its Access to Justice campaign. On 

April 3, 2009, the Court created the Tennessee Access to Justice Commission and charged it 

with developing its first strategic plan within the first year and updating the plan every two 

years thereafter. This 2014 Plan details the progress made in implementing the goals of the 

Commission's  2012 Strategic Plan and  proposes new objectives and benchmarks  to  address 

civil legal needs in the upcoming two years. 

The  Commission's  first  strategic  plan  submitted  in  2010  outlined  how  the  Supreme 

Court began its Access to Justice Initiative and the Court's impressive efforts to carry out this 

initiative.  During  the  past  five  years,  the  Court's  commitment  has  never  wavered.    The 

Court—as individual justices and as a whole—participates in access to justice events and in 

meetings of the Commission and its Advisory Committees1.  The Court also makes prompt 

decisions  to  promote  Access  to  Justice,  and  members  of  the  Court  speak  locally  and 

nationally on this topic. The leadership and visibility of the Court has inspired not only the 

Commission, but also the broader access to justice community, the bar and its associations, 

and  the  court  system  as  a  whole.  The  accomplishments  of  the  past  five  years  reflect  the 

dedication  and  support  of  a  broad  network  of  lawyers,  law  firms,  corporate  legal 

departments, bar associations, legal service programs, judges, clerks, law schools, librarians, 

service providers, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and a wide variety of other entities to 

accomplish these goals.2 

This  2014  Strategic  Plan  also  sets  forth  additional  goals  and  initiatives  to  aid  and 

expedite the Supreme Court's dynamic and ongoing Access to Justice campaign. In particular, 

                                                 
1 Advisory Committees are broad based and diverse committees in topical areas upon which stakeholders and 
persons with expertise serve. 
2 The Commission would be remiss if it did not recognize and thank Justice Janice Holder for serving as the 
Court's liaison to the Commission since its inception. 

 

 

the 2014 Plan focuses on the Commission's first goal, which is to involve more lawyers and 

law  students  in  meeting  legal  needs  so  that  the  public  is  better  served.  Key  to  the 

implementation  of  this  goal  is  a  more  comprehensive  pro  bono  delivery  system  across  the 

state,  which  has  taken  shape  through  the  establishment  of  1-888-aLEGALz  and  the 

publication  of  the  annual  pro  bono  report.  This  2014  Plan  also  addresses  the  necessity  of 

further  public  outreach  and  awareness  of  existing  access  to  justice  resources  for  self-

represented  individuals  and  the  community  at  large.  Finally,  the  2014  Plan  addresses  the 

Commission's commitment to careful measurement of the effectiveness of our collaborative 

efforts  in  order  to  assist  stakeholders  in  directing  resources  to  the  programs  that  most 

effectively address the critical needs of our citizens. 

II. 

Accomplishments and Highlights of the 2012 Strategic Plan. 

At  each  quarterly  meeting,  the  Commission  reviewed  the  2012  Plan  (Appendix  H) 

and  received  an  update  from  each  Committee  chair  regarding  the  Commission's  success  in 

accomplishing  these  goals.  The  Commission  and  its  collaborative  partners  have  met  or 

exceeded most of the goals set in the 2012 Plan. 

A. 

Attorneys  Performing  Pro  Bono  Legal  Services.  One  of  the  overarching 

goals of the 2012 Plan was to increase the number of attorneys who reside in Tennessee and 

provide pro bono services. As of the date of this report, this number represents 44.31% of all 

Tennessee  attorneys,  an  increase  of  26.05 %  since  2010.  The  average  amount  of  hours 

performed  by  those  attorneys  is  an  astounding  74.13  hours  per  year,  far  greater  than  the 

national average. 

B. 

The  Pro  Bono  Report.  As  the  Commission  recognized  in  2012,  a  common 

theme among participants in the national Access to Justice Community is that there is little 

comprehensive  information  regarding  the  pro  bono  activities  in  each  individual  state.  The 

Commission has continued to devote significant resources, primarily staff resources, to create 

2 

 

 

the Pro Bono report so that the Court, bar associations, law schools, direct service providers, 

and other stakeholders can use the report as a resource. 

C. 

Creation of 1-888-aLEGALz. Another important goal in the 2012 Plan was 

the  establishment  of  a  statewide  pro  bono  referral  network.  At  the  time  of  the  2012  Plan, 

Online  Tennessee  Justice,  the  nation's  first  interactive  pro  bono  website,  was  already  in 

service. This website provides limited scope advice to eligible clients across Tennessee and 

provides lawyers with the opportunity to provide pro bono services whenever and wherever 

they  can  access  a  computer  or  mobile  device.  The  Commission  learned  early  in  2012  that 

other states had successfully launched statewide toll-free numbers to answer legal questions 

from clients and to connect available resources with clients who needed help.  

With a grant from the Court (from CLE late fees paid by lawyers to the Commission 

on Continuing Legal Education and a $75,000 grant from International Paper Corporation), 1-

888-aLEGALz was launched in collaboration with the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services. 

This is Tennessee's first statewide, toll-free, legal-resource helpline. The hotline is staffed by 

Tim Hughes, an alumnus of Memphis Area Legal Services, and is housed at the Tennessee 

Alliance for Legal Services offices. This helpline can provide basic legal advice to callers or 

when more than basic or limited scope advice is needed, Tim Hughes can direct the client to 

available  resources.  The  launch  of  1-888-aLEGALz  is  another  important  and  meaningful 

stride towards establishing a statewide referral network for pro bono services in Tennessee. 

Together,  Online  Tennessee  Justice  and  aLEGALz  provide  important  access  to  legal 

information  and  legal  advice  for  all  Tennesseans.    The  latest  periodic  reports  for  1-888-

aLEGALz and Online Tennessee Justice are attached hereto as Appendix J. 

D. 

Education  of  Volunteer  Lawyers  and  Self-Represented  Litigants.  The 

2012  Plan  recognized  that  education  for  self-represented  litigants  as  well  as  for  attorneys 

willing  to  provide  pro  bono  services  is  a  critical  element  if  Tennessee  is  to  succeed  in 

3 

 

 

involving more lawyers and providing more services where the needs are the greatest. To that 

end,  the  Commission  developed  an  online  curriculum  in  high-needs  areas  of  the  law 

beginning with family law. The Commission also assisted in coordinating development of pro 

bono initiatives in law schools and involved the judiciary by asking judges to participate in 

online webcasts. 

E.  Marketing and Public Relations. Pursuant to the 2012 Plan, the Commission 

recommended  that  the  Court  establish  a  Supreme  Court  recognition  program.  This  Court-

recognition initiative began in the first quarter of 2014 and honors lawyers who perform 50 

hours of pro bono work per year. Law students who perform 50 hours of pro bono work while 

in  law  school  will  be  honored  as  Volunteers  for  Justice  upon  graduation.  Law  offices  that 

average 50 hours of pro bono work per lawyer will be recognized also. The Court has created 

and registered a trademarked seal for use  by  law  students and lawyers  on résumés, website 

listings,  and  other  materials  disseminated  to  the  public  relating  to  those  lawyers  or  law 

offices.  An  image  of  the  seal  is  attached  as  Appendix  K.  The  Court  will  hold  a  series  of 

regional events beginning in July 2014 to honor these lawyers, law students, and law offices. 

F. 

The  Pillar  Law  Firm  Initiative.  Building  on  the  partnership  model 

established by Nashville law firms and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the 

Cumberlands,  the  Commission  facilitated  the  launch  of  Pillar  Law  Firm  programs  in 

Memphis,  Knoxville,  and  Chattanooga.  Pursuant  to  the  Pillar  Law  Firm  model,  firms  with 

strong commitments to pro bono educate their attorneys on substantive areas of the law and 

take more pro bono cases in those substantive areas. This model allows the firms to develop 

special expertise across levels of seniority, organize groups topically within their firms, and 

create client teams to work on their pro bono assignments. 

G. 

Faith-Based  Initiatives  and  Facilitating  the  Creation  of  New  Pro  Bono 

Clinics.  In  February  2013,  the  Court  and  Commission  launched  the  Tennessee  Faith  & 

4 

 

 

Justice  Alliance  ("TFJA"),  an  alliance  of  faith-based  groups  in  Tennessee  created  to  align 

needs seen at the local church level with possible legal resources that are nearby, perhaps in 

the same congregation, and committed to providing legal resources to their congregations and 

communities. The notion is to connect with people in need in a place where they already go 

to  seek  help  with  a  problem,  which  is  quite  often  their  place  of  worship.  The  TFJA  also 

provides opportunities to help to attorneys who have not otherwise participated in organized 

pro  bono  but  are  motivated  to  serve  their  church  through  a  pro  bono  program.  The 

Commission  has  partnered  with  the  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  to  provide 

malpractice insurance to participating attorneys. 

The  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United  Methodist  Church  (“UMC”)  served  as  the 

location of the initiative’s pilot project, which was designed to pair an attorney with a place 

of worship. When a leader or clergy member of that congregation learns of a member's legal 

need, that leader can refer the person to a  local attorney  who has volunteered to  serve  as a 

resource for that congregation. That attorney in turn will provide the legal advice needed or 

make connections with other resources that can provide necessary services. 

The  UMC  model  is  just  one  way  to  offer  services.  The  flexibility  of  the  TFJA 

program  allows  communities  to  design  programs  to  meet  their  local  needs.    For  example, 

Cross  Point  Church  in  Nashville  organized  legal  teams  that  partner  with  addiction 

rehabilitation  organizations.  The  legal  teams  work  with  program  graduates  to  deal  with 

outstanding legal issues that may impede the graduates' success after their rehabilitation. The 

legal  teams  are  composed  of  church  member  attorneys  and  law  students.  The  law  students 

complete client intake, conduct legal research, and draft motions, while the attorneys oversee 

their work. If a court appearance is required to remedy the situation, the attorneys represent 

the client in court. 

The clinic started at Lipscomb University, a Christian institution, is another example. 

5 

 

 

The Lipscomb Institute for Law, Justice & Society recruited alumni attorneys to serve at bi-

monthly, free, walk-in legal clinics. 

H. 

Assistance  to  Self-Represented  Litigants.  The  Commission  has  produced a 

series of educational videos for self-represented litigants. It has developed and recommended 

plain-language  forms  for  self-represented  litigants  and  has  expanded  the  available  divorce 

forms to include forms for the uncontested divorce of parties with minor children. It has also 

developed plain-language resources regarding child support guidelines. 

Working  with  the  General  Sessions  Judges  Conference,  the  Commission  has 

examined and made recommendations to increase attorney involvement in helping otherwise 

self-represented  individuals  through  Attorney-of-the-Day  programs  and  other  limited-scope 

representation initiatives in the General Sessions courts. 

Also,  in  collaboration  with  the  Tennessee  General  Sessions  Judges  Conference,  a 

General  Sessions  court  pro  se  bench  book,  “Meeting  the  Challenges  of  Self-Represented 

Litigants,” has been created and circulated and is now being used as a model for the creation 

of a Circuit and Chancery Court Pro Se Bench Book.3    Supplemental Guidelines for self-

represented litigants were also created in conjunction with the Bench Book. 

In  collaboration  with  the  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility,  the  Commission 

recommended and  the Court adopted a policy distinguishing  between  legal information  and 

legal advice that continues to provide guidance to court staff, clerks, and attorneys. 

The  Commission  has  developed  plain-language  signage  for  courthouses  and 

distributed it to courts across the state. 

The  Court  has  also  made  the  Access  to  Justice  website  and  the  Supplemental 

Guidelines referenced above available in Spanish. 

 

                                                 
3 The Commission wishes to thank the Honorable Dwight Stokes and all the members of the General Sessions 
Judges Conference for their great work in this area. 

6 

 

 

 

I. 

Recruitment  of  Additional  Lawyers  and  Law  Students  for  Pro  Bono 

Work.  The  2012  Plan  included  a  goal  of  increasing  the  number  of  law  firms  and  legal 

departments with formal pro bono policies. The Commission, through its pro bono committee 

and in collaboration with the Tennessee Bar Association, has surpassed its goal of increasing 

by  15  the  number  of  law  firms  and  legal  departments  that  have  adopted  pro  bono  policies. 

Seventeen additional law firms and legal departments have adopted formal pro bono policies.  

The  Commission  convened  a  telephone  conference  of  law  school  deans  and  law 

school  pro  bono  directors  in  the  fall  of  2012  and  participated  in  statewide  law  school 

conferences in January and September of 2013 to increase pro bono participation among law 

students and law faculty. Members of  the  Court attended all three events. The  Commission 

has also convened four quarterly telephone conferences with legal services entities and non-

legal services direct providers to discuss issues affecting the legal services community and to 

coordinate the Commission's efforts with these providers. 

III.  The Commission's Strategic Vision. 

 

At this point in the Commission's history, the Court, the Commission, and all of the 

collaborative partners in the access to justice community can be rightfully proud of what has 

been  accomplished  in  these  past  five  years4.  State  and  local  bar  associations,  legal  service 

providers,  non-legal  service  providers,  law  schools,  faith-based  organizations,  libraries, and 

persons and entities too numerous to name have established an extensive mosaic of resources 

that serves as a strong foundation from which to build. The Commission's challenge and the 

challenge  of  the  cause  of  equal  access  to justice  generally,  are  to  create and  improve  upon 

programs and processes that will allow Tennessee to sustain its momentum. 

 

                                                 
4 The National Center for Access to Justice at Cardozo Law School’s Justice Index, found at 
http://www.justiceindex.org, is a model for improving the quality of justice through the use of performance 
measurement.  The web-based system gathers and presents data showing the extent to which each of our 50-
state justice systems succeeds in assuring access to all.  Tennessee scored in the top 10.    

7 

 

 

To that end, our overarching strategic goal remains to increase access to justice for all 

citizens  of  Tennessee  by  engaging  more  Tennessee  lawyers  in  the  provision  of  pro  bono 

services.  With a growing population in poverty and shrinking financial resources, however, 

our goals must now involve measurement of the effectiveness of our efforts.  

 

The Commission is no longer satisfied simply to propose new rules or to launch new 

programs.  The  Commission  commits to  measure  the  impact  that  our  work  is  having  on  the 

lives  of  Tennesseans.  This  disciplined  approach  will  allow  us  to  place  emphasis  on  the 

programs that have been the most effective, to discontinue spending resources on programs 

that  have  not  been  effective,  and  to  use  new technologies  and  the  new  information  that  we 

gather to leverage existing programs and launch new programs where the need is the greatest. 

In  the  Commission's  judgment,  the  next  stage  in  the  evolution  of  the  Court's  work,  and  in 

fact,  the  cause  of  equal  justice  in  general,  is  to  strive  toward  making  the  most  profound 

difference possible in the lives of Tennesseans with the human, financial, and technological 

resources available to us. 

 

The  Commission  also  recognizes  there  will  continue  to  be  instances  when  a  person 

cannot afford the cost of a traditional lawyer, does not have access to pro bono resources, and 

will  be  required  to  represent  themselves  in  court.  The  Commission  commits  to  developing 

additional resources directed towards low-income Tennesseans who must navigate the court 

system  without  the  benefit  of  counsel.  In  addition,  existing  resources  available  for  self-

represented  litigants  will  be  a  component  of  the  Commission’s  public-awareness  efforts 

going forward. 

IV. 

Summary of Recommendations for the 2014-2016 Strategic Plan. 

A. 

Assess Legal Needs. The last state-wide legal needs study done in Tennessee 

was published in 2004 and utilized data collected in 2003.  In order for the Commission and 

its  collaborative  partners  to  refine  existing  programs  and  launch  new  initiatives  that  will 

8 

 

 

impact the most Tennesseans in  the  most profound way, the Commission believes  that it is 

now time to reassess legal needs in Tennessee. From the working poor to the homeless, we 

need  a  more  recent  and  accurate  snapshot  of  the  types  of  needs  that  now  exist,  the 

Tennesseans who have the most profound need for legal services, and the location of those 

needs throughout our state. 

 

Thanks  to  a  generous  grant  from  the  Ansley  Fund  of  the  Frist  Foundation  and  in 

collaboration  with  the  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  and  the  Tennessee  Bar 

Association,  a  new  legal  needs  study  has  been  undertaken.  This  legal  needs  study  will  be 

performed by the University of Tennessee School of Social Work, which conducted the study 

published in 2004. This new study will give us reliable and current information that we can

$16,857,503 in cost savings, and a total economic impact of $48,775,327 in the state.  We expect to also 
complete an economic impact study in Tennessee by the end of 2014.

these  resources,  and  others,  are  underutilized.  Public  awareness  of  the  available  resources, 

therefore, deserves careful attention over the next two years. 

One  step,  for  example,  will  be  the  creation  of  a  poster  to  be  displayed  in  clerks’ 

offices  and  other  locations  informing  the  public  of  available  resources.  This  poster  will 

include a Quantum Point Contact (“QPC”) code that smart phone  users can scan to receive 

more  information.  The  Commission  will  also  target  centers  of  community  contact  such  as 

laundry mats, health clinics, and public transportation and will send a monthly email to social 

agencies.  The  Commission  will  also  utilize  social  media  to  disseminate  information  and  to 

explore the use of public service announcements on radio and television.

C. 

Establish  Direct  Communication  Channels  with  Volunteers.  In  the 

Commission's  judgment,  the  Court  itself  should  have  the  capability  of  direct  emailing  to 

attorneys  through  the  Commission  or  other  channels.  The  Tennessee  Bar  Association, 

utilizing its award winning member service, TBA Today, has been a most generous partner in 

helping  the  Court  and  Commission  inform  Tennessee  lawyers  about  access  to  justice 

developments. Likewise, the Board of Professional Responsibility has been a full partner in 

helping  the  Court  and  the  Commission  communicate  with  lawyers  with  regard  to  access  to 

justice issues. The Commission places tremendous value on these collaborative relationships; 

however,  the  Commission  believes  that  it  should  also  have  its  own  process  for  emailing 

Tennessee  lawyers  to  inform  them  of  needs,  available  resources,  pro  bono  volunteer 

opportunities,  and  Court  recognition  programs.  To  that  end,  the  Commission  will,  with  the 

Court's  permission,  obtain  the  information  it  needs  to  send  its  own  emails  to  Tennessee 

lawyers.

Recommend  a  Pro  Bono  Reporting  Requirement  to  the  Court.  Just  as 

more  information  and  new  information  are  needed  regarding  the  legal  needs  of  Tennessee 

citizens, more information is necessary to evaluate the pro bono services being rendered and 

 

11 

 

  G

 

 

the  volunteers  providing  those  services.  In  recent  years,  the  number  of  Tennessee  lawyers 

reporting their pro bono hours has risen from 18% to more than 44%. At times, that number 

has  been  as  high  as  48%,  extremely  close  to  the  goal  stated  in  the  2012  Strategic  Plan  of 

having 50% of Tennessee attorneys voluntarily providing pro bono services. However, even 

if  50%  of  Tennessee  attorneys  report  providing  pro  bono  services,  this  information  still 

presents  an  incomplete  picture  of  how  much  pro  bono  is  being  performed  and  who  is 

volunteering.  Although  the  Commission  is  unanimously  against  mandatory  pro  bono  and 

strongly  in  favor  of  maintaining  the  confidentiality  of  each  individual  attorney's  pro  bono 

information, the Commission has, since its inception, believed that the Court should require 

attorneys to report their pro bono hours with their annual registration. 

Reporting  pro  bono  does  not  require  record  keeping  and  certainly  will  not  involve 

after-the-fact audits. Requiring attorneys to estimate their pro bono hours has never been, as 

some have claimed, a gateway to requiring that attorneys perform pro bono services. Reports 

by  individual  lawyers  should  be  kept  confidential  unless  confidentiality  is  waived  by  the 

lawyer so that the Court may recognize those lawyers who have provided pro bono services. 

Just as it is important to understand the legal needs in Tennessee, it is important to understand 

how much pro bono service is being rendered and by whom. This information is invaluable 

with respect to planning and triaging initiatives, legislative policy, and grant applications, to 

name  a  few.  Reporting  estimated,  pro  bono  hours  should  take  most  lawyers  less  than  one 

minute to note on their annual registration form. (The Commission will explore the feasibility 

of reporting directly to the Commission rather than through the BPR.)

E. 

Target  the  Needs  of  Tennesseans  in  the  Area  of  Family  Law.  All  of  the 

providers  in  the  field  and  all  of  the  volunteers  at  the  clinics,  as  well  as  the  data  captured 

through  Online  Tennessee  Justice  and  1-888-aLEGALz,  indicate  that  Tennessee's  most 

profound  need  is  in  the  area  of  family  law.    For  example,  there  are  few  resources  for  low 

income Tennesseans with custody issues and few options for a spouse that does not control 

the  marital  assets  to  afford  the  traditional  cost  of  hiring  a  lawyer.    In  keeping  with  the 

Commission's  commitment  to  place  emphasis  where  it  can  best  impact  the  lives  of 

Tennesseans, the Commission will target family law by steering existing Pillar Law Firms to 

family  law  cases  and  recruiting  additional  Pillar  Law  Firms  who  will  handle  family  law 

cases.    The  Commission  will  also  assist  LSC  providers  create  and  expand  existing  divorce 

clinics, update and promote existing and upcoming plain language divorce forms, create new 

plain  language  family  law  forms,  recruit  more  mediators  to  perform  pro  bono  family 

mediations, promote the use of the limited scope representation rule in family law cases.

Target  The  Needs  Of  Rural  Tennesseans.  While  family  law  is  the  topical 

area on which the Commission commits to focus, the Commission also believes that the legal 

needs  of  Tennesseans  living  in  rural  areas  should  be  a  strategic  focus.  The  Commission 

commits to establishing new clinics in rural judicial districts. The Commission will also use 

new  technologies  to  meet  the  needs  of  Tennesseans  living  in  rural  areas  where  few  or  no 

volunteer attorneys are available. Our ultimate goal is to have either an in-person clinic or a 

remote clinic using mobile devices occur periodically and reliably in every judicial district.

Hold a Tennessee Faith and Justice Summit. The Commission will host the 

first-ever  statewide  gathering  of  faith-based  organizations  and  pro  bono  lawyers  with  a 

common  interest  in  assisting  Tennesseans  with  civil  legal  problems.  The  Summit  will 

highlight  the  Tennessee  Faith  and  Justice  Alliance.  This  Summit  will  be  used  as  a  way  to 

refine  the  processes and  training,  evaluate  the  interests  in  existing  entities,  and  recruit  new

Expand  and  Enhance  the  Effectiveness  of  the  Faith-based  Initiative  and 

the Tennessee Faith and Justice Alliance. The Commission's role with respect to the faith-

based  initiative  and  the  Tennessee  Faith  and  Justice  Alliance  should  be  one  of  recruiting, 

incubation, training, and monitoring. In the Commission's judgment, the key to an effective 

faith-based  program  is  to  have  champions  within  organizations  who  will  promote  the 

program,  recruit  volunteers,  and  make  sure  that  the  initiative  is  functioning  properly.  It  is 

impossible  for  the  Commission  staff  to  perform  that  role  for  faith-based  entities  and 

simultaneously  expand  the  number  of  programs  serving  Tennesseans  and  the  number  of 

Tennesseans who are served. 

Accordingly,  the  Commission  has  decided  to  direct  staff  resources  to  those  entities 

with a well-functioning champion in place. Our staff can provide a template for establishing 

   

Goal:

an initiative and help train the original champion or champions within each entity. Our staff 

should  then  move  on  to  recruiting  the  next  entity  and  assisting  them  with  launching  their 

programs.  In  keeping  with  this  strategic  plan's  theme  of  carefully  marshaling  resources  to 

have the most  profound  effect on the largest number  of Tennesseans, our  role should be to 

recruit  receptive  new  entities  and  train  the  champions  within  those  entities.  This  approach 

should be effective immediately and should be ongoing throughout the term of this strategic 

plan.

Use the American Bar Association (“ABA”) Innovation Grant to Promote 

Rural Faith-Based Projects. In keeping with the Commission's focus on meeting the needs 

of rural Tennesseans, the Commission is committed to meeting the requirements of our ABA 

Innovation Grant by having two rural projects up and running by May 2014. The two projects 

are  expanding  the  referral  model  piloted  by  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United 

Methodist  Church  under  the  TFJA  and  creating  a  new  faith-based  clinic  in  a  rural  county. 

Under  the  grant,  the  Commission  is  charged  with  developing  a  model  to  assist  in  the 

replication  of  this  project.  The  pilot  project  adopted  by  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the 

United Methodist Church will serve as the prototype for the model. The pilot project has been 

in  existence  for  a  year,  and  the  Commission  will  modify  the  pilot  project  so  that  it  can  be 

applied universally and will develop best practices for adopting the model.

or  downloaded  from  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Court  website  or  the  Access  to  Justice 

website. The Commission will also work with the State Court Clerks Association of Tennessee

self-represented  litigants  a  series  of  questions  and  uses  the  answers  to  populate  the  necessary 

forms.  The  Commission  will  research  other  states  and  entities  using  similar  programs  to  assist

represented litigants, and to litigants who, although represented, have modest means 

or who are pro bono clients. 

Tennessee is fortunate to have pro bono mediation centers and pro bono mediator-of-the-day 

programs in some communities. The ATJ Commission will work with the ADR Commission 

to  increase  the  number  of  pro  bono  mediators  providing  pro  bono  mediations.  The 

Commission chair will also create a mediation committee that will work to replicate mediator

Commission  will  use  law  students  to  further  the  projects  outlined  in  this  Plan.    The 

Commission will carry on its partnership with the law schools and TBA ATJ Committee and

M.  Make The  Public Aware of Existing  Resources. As in many states, one of 

the challenges faced by our Commission and the access to justice community generally is the 

connection of resources to need. Some resources, of course, are fully utilized at this time. For 

example,  1-888-aLEGALz  is  being  utilized  to  the  fullest  capacity  of  the  existing  staff  and 

volunteers.  Based  on  the  number  of  volunteers  signed  up  for  Online  Tennessee  Justice, 

however, it could be more fully utilized if the public were more aware of it. In addition, the 

Commission  has  received  reports  of  limited  scope  clinics  with  very  low  lawyer-to-client 

ratios. The Commission has also observed that there are Pillar Law Firms in some cities that 

are not receiving as many case assignments as they could handle. Finally, as of January 2014, 

there are more  than 65 law firms and legal departments  that have adopted  formal  pro  bono 

plans or policies. The Commission has observed that some of these firms are fully utilizing 

their  plans  and  are  being  called  upon  to  provide  pro  bono  services  pursuant  to  their  plan’s 

structure.  Other  legal  departments  and  firms  with  pro  bono  plans,  however,  are  not  being 

fully utilized or are not being utilized at all. 

The  Commission  will  recruit  a  full  complement  of  lawyers  and  non-lawyers  with 

public  awareness  skills  and/or  public  relations  backgrounds  to  the  Public  Awareness 

Committee. The committee will operate on two fronts: the first is to make the public aware of 

existing  resources;  and  the  second  is  to  make  sure  lawyers  are  aware  of  opportunities  to 

provide  pro  bono  services,  are  trained  to  provide  those  services,  and are  recognized  by  the 

Court for volunteering their time and expertise.

Data Management.  A focus of this Strategic Plan will be to capture data that 

with  respect  to  the  legal  needs  of  Tennesseans,  the  opportunities  to  recruit  additional  pro 

bono volunteers, and the effectiveness of the pro bono services being provided measures the 

extent to which we are impacting the lives of our fellow Tennesseans in a positive way. Some 

data  collection  is  already  taking  place  through  the  Commission’s  strategic  partners  such  as 

pro bono clinic providers and the Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services with aLEGALz and 

Online Tennessee Justice. The Commission will gather existing data and develop a universal 

data-collection tool for clinic providers and pro bono programs to submit to the Commission. 

Other  initiatives  such  as  Pillar  Law  Firms,  pro  bono  policy  adoption,  and  usage  of  plain 

language  forms  have  not  reported  data  or  the  Commission  has  not  collected  the  data.  The 

Commission  will  begin  to  collect  data on these types of initiatives.  To the extent possible, 

the  Commission  will  work  with  its  partners  to  develop  a  universal  instrument  to  survey 

clients  on  their  satisfaction  with  the  pro  bono  assistance  they  received.    To  enable  the 

Commission and its partners to determine where to focus resources and how to move forward 

to  provide  low  income  Tennesseans  access  to  the  judicial  system,  the  Commission  will 

develop a data-management system, which will be a central repository for these data.

partners. Nevertheless, the Commission is mindful that access to justice is the Court's primary 

strategic priority and the needs of our fellow citizens will never abate. We approach this plan, 

and the work it represents, therefore with a strong sense of urgency. Our fellow Tennesseans 

deserve no less.

The 2012 Tennessee Pro Bono Report

Executive Summary

The efforts of the Tennessee Supreme Court and the Access to Justice Commission to
increase pro bono services and pro bono reporting are having an impact on
Tennessee’s licensed attorneys.

Based on information and statistics collected, attorneys have provided most of their pro
bono assistance by directly helping low-income Tennesseans with their legal needs.
Since commencement of the collection of statistics in 2009, Tennessee attorneys have
shown they are stepping up and responding to the civil legal needs gap by donating
more time to pro bono projects.

In 2011, the Access to Justice Commission recommended and the Tennessee Supreme
Court approved a streamlined Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form that has aided in the
reporting of pro bono activity hours by attorneys. Continuing its support of pro bono
reporting by attorneys, the Tennessee Supreme Court sent a letter to all licensed
attorneys in their 2012 annual attorney license renewal packets from the  Board of
Professional Responsibility, encouraging the voluntary reporting of pro bono hours. We
will be able to quantify the impact of this  encouragement when the 2012 reporting
statistics are available.

In 2011, 46.11% of Tennessee’s licensed attorneys reported 804,961 hours of pro bono
work, for an average of 82.68 hours per attorney reporting pro bono work. The pro bono
legal services were provided and reported in four categories:

! Legal services without a fee or at a substantially reduced fee to persons of

! Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited

limited means;

means;

! Legal services to groups and organizations at a reduced fee when payment of

standard fees would create a financial hardship; and

! Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, or the legal profession.

Since 2009, reported pro bono hours have increased dramatically. 

The Access to Justice Commission has established a goal of 50% of all licensed
attorneys providing at least 50 hours of pro bono service per year. Forty-six percent of
all attorneys voluntarily reported providing pro bono services during 2011. For those

who reported, the average number of pro bono services provided per attorney was
significantly higher than 50 hours during the year. In a short period of time, the
Commission has come close to achieving this goal.

The pro bono services reporting data for this report was obtained from the Tennessee
Board of Professional Responsibility. Surveys of organizations involved in providing
legal services or involved in providing non-legal services, such as mediation, to those
with legal issues were also completed.

The members of the Supreme Court of Tennessee and the Access to Justice
Commission, thank the Tennessee licensed attorneys, legal services organizations, bar
associations, mediators, judges, and all those involved in providing legal assistance or
working with those that provide legal assistance to low-income members of their
communities. You have made a difference and have made access to justice a reality for
many.

The 2012 Tennessee Pro Bono Report

This 2012 Tennessee Pro Bono Report contains information about and statistics on the
hours devoted to pro bono activities of legal aid providers, bar associations, law
schools, and individual attorneys in 2011. Comparisons with 2010 and 2009 statistics
have also been completed.

The following definitions apply to the breakdown of the reporting groups:

“All Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee regardless of the
location of their primary address

“All Government Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee and
employed by Tennessee state government regardless of the location of their primary
address

“All In-House Counsel” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee and
employed by a Tennessee employer as in-house counsel regardless of the location of
their primary address

“Out-of-State Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee whose
primary address is outside of Tennessee

“Out-of-State Government Attorneys” - all government attorneys licensed to practice law
in Tennessee whose primary address is outside of Tennessee

“Out-of-State In-House Counsel” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee,
employed as in-house counsel for a Tennessee employer, and whose primary address
is outside of Tennessee

“Tennessee Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee whose
primary address is in Tennessee

“Tennessee Government Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in
Tennessee whose primary address is in Tennessee

“Tennessee In-House Counsel” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee,
employed as in-house counsel for a Tennessee employer and whose primary address is
in Tennessee

Attorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics

The Tennessee Supreme Court adopted Supreme Court Rule 9, Section 20.11 on
November 2, 2009. The Rule requests that every attorney who is required to file an
Annual Registration Statement with the Board of Professional Responsibility (“BPR”)
voluntarily file a statement reporting the attorney’s pro bono service and activity during
the last calendar year. The Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form was first included in the
2010 BPR Registration Statement and reported data for the 2009 calendar year.

The Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to
require renewals on the first day of each attorney’s birth month. Under this new
procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until
all reporting for that year has been received.

The Access to Justice Commission now has pro bono reporting data for three calendar
years, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The Access to Justice Commission is pleased to provide
an analysis of the 2011 data and a comparison to that of the previous two years.

2011 Statistics

Pursuant to the Access to Justice Commission’s 2012 Strategic Plan, the Access to
Justice Commission is focused on pro bono work that aids Tennesseans. The 2011
statistics reflect pro bono work performed in 2011 and reported during the 2012 annual
registration period.

The 2011 reporting form asked for feedback from attorneys in four categories of pro
bono service.

1. Pro Bono Hours Reported by All Attorneys

The group of All Attorneys subject to the 2011 annual registration process totaled over
21,000 attorneys. Almost half of these attorneys reported pro bono hours.

3. Pro Bono Hours Reported by Tennessee Government Attorneys

For the first time in 2011, a request was made to the Board of Professional
Responsibility (“BPR”) for a breakdown of hours provided by Tennessee Government
Attorneys. The BPR also provided the number of attorneys who indicated they were in-
house counsel; however, we did not request that the BPR provide the number of hours
this category of attorneys provided. In the 2009 and 2010 data, the hours provided by
Tennessee Government Attorneys and Tennessee In-House Counsel were simply
included in total attorney hours noted in chart 2(b) above.

Out-of-State Attorneys reporting pro bono service hours compose 7.18% of All
Attorneys. Twenty-four attorneys whose primary address is outside of Tennessee
indicated that they are in-house counsel, and 30 attorneys residing outside of
Tennessee indicated that they are government attorneys. The reporting data from
attorneys residing outside Tennessee reflect the same trends as to category and

Overall Results

Access to justice cannot be achieved without collaboration. The multiple partners of the
Court and the Commission include but are not limited to the many volunteers on the
Commission's numerous committees and workgroups, attorneys, legal services
organizations, bar associations, law schools and law students, mediators, judges, and
countless volunteers involved in providing day-to-day assistance to those needing legal
services within their communities. The results of these efforts are over 800,000 pro
bono service hours reported in 2011.

Tennesseans have responded to the civil legal needs gap—they have donated time,
talent, and treasure to pro bono services, programs, and projects. They have provided
pro bono assistance by directly providing legal services at no cost or at substantially
reduced rates to low-income Tennesseans, by providing legal services to non-profit
organizations serving persons of limited means, by providing legal services to groups
and organizations at a reduced fee when payment of standard fees would create a
financial hardship, and by providing legal services to improve the law, the legal system,
or the legal profession.

The efforts of many have made a difference. Access to Justice has become a reality for
many low-income Tennesseans.

Additional Information, Data and Survey Highlights

Bar Association Pro Bono

Using www.surveymonkey.com, the Pro Bono Coordinator surveyed regional and local
bar associations about the pro bono initiatives and efforts sponsored by each bar
association. Bar association presidents were emailed a link to complete the survey. The
Pro Bono Coordinator followed up with phone calls and emails to encourage additional
responses.

To date, 33 responses were received from bar associations. Highlights and insights
obtained from some of the survey responses are listed below.

Many of the rural and some suburban bar associations do not have formal organized
pro bono programs but do accept referrals from their local legal aid offices.

Several bar associations noted specific pro bono initiatives or are working on developing
pro bono initiatives:

! Anderson County Bar Association has a need for pro bono volunteers to address

issues regarding access to healthcare (TennCare) and other benefits.

! Coffee County Bar Association is developing a pro bono packet to distribute to all
new members in an effort to recruit more participation in the bar. The packet will
educate new members on the benefits of participating in pro bono cases.

! Cumberland County Bar Association has members who have ideas for pro bono

projects and would like to partner with the Commission in these efforts.

! Henry County Bar Association hosts an annual event during which members

prepare wills, powers of attorney, and living wills for military and EMS personnel
in Henry, Benton, and Weakley counties.

! Knox County Bar Association created a Legal Legacy Project to pair law students
and newer attorneys with more experienced practitioners to handle pro bono
cases. The Knoxville Bar Association also introduced the Pillar Law Firm Model
to its members in October 2012. The Pillar Law Firm Model is an initiative to
increase the number of law firms/offices with pro bono policies for its members.

! Loudon County Bar Association has a need for pro bono services for members of

Spanish-speaking communities unfamiliar with legal practices in the United
States.

Law School Pro Bono

In its 2012 Strategic Plan, the Access to Justice Commission acknowledged the
importance of introducing pro bono services to future attorneys while they are still in law
school. The Access to Justice Commission was committed to convening meetings with
law school deans, law school pro bono directors, and students at least annually to
explore increasing the participation of law students in pro bono activities. The
Commission also compiled the pro bono policies of Tennessee law schools into one
document, a Pro Bono Policy Compilation, as a resource for Tennessee law schools
and for law schools nationwide.

The Tennessee Bar Association’s Law School Subcommittee of its Access to Justice
Committee conducted a survey of Tennessee law schools to develop a list of the pro
bono and clinical opportunities for law students. This Resource Inventory provides
details on the clinical programs offered by each school, formal law student pro bono
programs, informal law student pro bono opportunities, alumni pro bono opportunities,
and resources and support for public interest careers. The Access to Justice
Coordinator and the Pro Bono Coordinator contacted the law schools to gather
supplemental information to include in the Resource Inventory.

Resource Inventory Highlights

! Belmont College of Law: This school is the newest addition to the Inventory. All
Student Bar Association officers are required to perform 20 hours of public
interest work. Committee chairs and members of the committees must each
complete 10 hours of public interest work. Belmont Legal Aid Society members
pledge to complete 25 hours of public interest work per year.

! Duncan School of Law: Law students are required to complete 30 hours of pro
bono services to graduate. Each member of the faculty is required to complete
20 hours of pro bono per year to be considered for tenure.

! University of Tennessee: This law school offers seven different clinical programs.
UT Pro Bono, a student-run organization, handles pro bono projects with faculty
and administrative support. The University of Tennessee offers alumni pro bono
opportunities supervised by its Access to Justice Coordinator at the Career
Center and the Office of Development and Alumni Affairs. The University also
offers public interest fellowships, stipends, and loan repayment assistance to its
students.

-11-

! University of Memphis: The Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law offers four

different clinical programs: Child and Family Litigation, Civil Litigation, Elder Law
Clinic, and Housing Adjudication. The Public Action Law Society (PALS) is the
formal student pro bono program and it conducts an annual pro bono fair. The
law school is developing a system for alumni and local attorneys to request
student assistance in providing pro bono services to low-income residents.
Beginning in January 2013, students are required to complete 40 hours of pro
bono work to graduate.

! Vanderbilt University: This law school offers five different clinical programs. Pro
bono organizations include Vanderbilt Legal Aid Society and Law Students for
Social Justice. Externship programs, stipends for internships, and post-graduate
stipends are available, as well as loan repayment assistance.

Legal Service Providers – Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”)-Funded

In Tennessee, there are four legal aid providers that receive federal funding from the
Legal Services Corporation(“LSC”): Legal Aid of East Tennessee, Legal Aid Society of
Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, Memphis Area Legal Services, and West
Tennessee Legal Services. In October 2011, the Access to Justice Commission Chair
and the Access to Justice Coordinator met with the executive directors of these
organizations to begin an ongoing discussion about how the Access to Justice
Commission and the LSC-funded legal aid providers can collaborate to increase the pro
bono assistance provided by Tennessee attorneys. The Access to Justice Commission
Chair now holds quarterly conference calls with these directors.

According to federal regulations, LSC-funded legal aid providers must use at least 12.5
percent of their LSC funds for Private Attorney Involvement (pro bono). Each of the four
LSC-funded organizations has a Pro Bono Coordinator/Director. The coordinators
provide a wide range of services and interact with a variety of partners to provide
assistance to substantial numbers of clients. These services range from arranging
classic attorney-client representation to providing unbundled services. The coordinators
also provide support services for pro bono activities such as intake, referrals to a variety
of programs, continuing legal education, malpractice coverage, legal clinics, partnering
with bar associations to highlight the profession’s commitment to access to justice,
recognition activities, and numerous other activities.

-12-

General information gathered from the four LSC-funded organizations’ directors and
websites is provided below. A chart detailing pro bono opportunities and pro bono
statistics for the organizations is attached as Exhibit A.

Legal Aid of East Tennessee (LAET)

LAET has been part of the community structure of East Tennessee for over 40 years,
serving 26 counties from Hamilton County to Johnson County. LAET has six offices with
locations in Chattanooga, Maryville, Johnson City, Morristown, and two offices in
Knoxville (Family Justice Center and LAET office). There are Pro Bono Directors in the
Knoxville and Chattanooga offices.

Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands (LAS)

LAS serves 48 Tennessee counties with its eight offices: Clarksville, Columbia,
Cookeville, Gallatin, Murfreesboro, Nashville, Oak Ridge, and Tullahoma. To qualify for
assistance from the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands,
clients must be at least 60 years of age or from a low-income household. People living
outside the Nashville office’s service area are instructed to call the LAS office serving
their county to find out about pro bono opportunities. LAS has a full-time Pro Bono
Director in the Nashville office.

The Nashville office has the most pro bono resources. In addition to providing legal
counsel for nonprofit organizations, LAS will accept cases in the following areas:
domestic violence, family law, employment (federal income tax disagreements, wage
claims, discrimination, job training courses), health (TennCare, Medicaid, Medicare,
nursing home issues, living wills, powers of attorney), housing (Section 8 or public
housing, evictions, foreclosures, rental issues, unfair loans, homeowner counseling),
and money (illegal collection methods, bankruptcy, SSI, Families First, TANF, SNAP,
unemployment, simple wills for individuals over 60 years of age and the seriously ill).
LAS generally does not accept immigration issues or divorce cases unrelated to
domestic violence.

Memphis Area Legal Services (MALS)

MALS provides civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and the elderly in
southwestern Tennessee, anchored by its office in Memphis. Its Covington office serves
three smaller rural communities: Tipton, Fayette, and Lauderdale counties. MALS has a
full-time Pro Bono Coordinator. Priorities include cases involving issues related to family

-13-

and children, housing and real property, consumer issues, individual and civil rights,
health and income maintenance, and seniors.

West Tennessee Legal Services (WTLS)

WTLS serves Benton, Carroll, Chester, Crockett, Dyer, Decatur, Gibson, Hardeman,
Hardin, Haywood, Henry, Henderson, Lake, McNairy, Madison, Obion, and Weakley
counties. Its main office is in Jackson, with offices in Dyersburg, Huntingdon, and
Selmer. It has one part-time Pro Bono Director/Coordinator. WTLS accepts the following
types of civil cases: access to health/medical care, securing or retaining housing,
ensuring compliance with Fair Housing Laws, securing or retaining income, personal
freedom and security rights, parental rights with state action, rights of persons in
institutions, freedom of all persons from abuse, family issues, education rights,
consumer rights, and community education. WTLS does not accept cases with the
potential of a high monetary judgment or adult criminal cases.

Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC-Funded

In Tennessee, there are many legal service providers that do not receive funding from
the Legal Services Corporation. The Tennessee Access to Justice Commission
considers any organization that does not receive funding from the Legal Services
Corporation a non-LSC-funded legal service provider. Non-LSC-funded organizations
can serve segments of the population that LSC-funded providers cannot. Non-LSC-
funded organizations do not have to follow federal income guidelines to determine if a
person is eligible to receive legal services. 

The Commission has gathered data from the following non-LSC providers: Catholic
Charities of Tennessee, Community Legal Center, Compassionate Counsel, Disability
Law & Advocacy Center, Justice for Our Neighbors, Southeast Tennessee Legal
Services, Southern Migrant Legal Services, Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and
Sexual Violence, and Tennessee Volunteer Lawyers and Professionals for the Arts. A
chart detailing the pro bono opportunities and pro bono statistics of each provider is
attached as Exhibit B.

-14-

Mediation Center Pro Bono

In Tennessee, some counties have mediation centers offering free or reduced-fee
mediation services to people who cannot afford a mediator. The Administrative Office of
the Courts has limited funding from the General Assembly to assist mediation centers
that apply for and meet grant criteria. The grants are designed to help low-income
Tennesseans access mediation services.

The Commission has gathered data from the following mediation center providers:
Community Mediation Center, Community Reconciliation, Inc., Family Court Services of
East Tennessee, First Judicial District Court Clinic, Mediation Services of Putnam
County, Mid South Mediation Services, Nashville Conflict Resolution Center, and
Neighborhood Reconciliation Services.

A chart containing information about each provider, including its pro bono statistics, is
attached as Exhibit C.

Continuing Legal Education (“CLE”) Credit Attorneys Received for Pro Bono
Work in 2012

Supreme Court Rule 21, Section 4.07(c) permits the Continuing Legal Education
(“CLE”) Commission to give Ethics & Professionalism credit at the rate of one hour of
credit for every five billable hours of pro bono legal representation provided through
court appointment or an organized bar association program or legal services
organization, or of pro bono mediation services as required by Supreme Court Rule 31
or the Federal Court Mediation Programs.

As of March 1, 2013, the CLE Commission has posted 3,780.84 hours of CLE credit
given to attorneys for pro bono work done in 2012. This is the highest number of CLE
credit hours given since the Commission began collecting this data.

The Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services and the Tennessee Bar Association, with
support from the Tennessee Access to Justice Commission, has developed an online
legal resource that allows those with legal questions to email their questions to a central
website. (www.OnlineTNJustice.org). These questions are then answered by volunteer
attorneys. Information and statistics regarding this pro bono resource are below.

In addition to recruiting volunteer lawyers to handle full 
representation of clients in litigation and transactional 
matters, we offer the following clinics:  

 Advice Clinics are designed to assist clients who have 
questions about routine legal issues and do not require 
on-going representation.  We conduct at least three 
“Saturday Bar” Advice Clinics per month, and offer Clinics 
as part of special events sponsored by LAET or in 
collaboration with other social service providers.  In 2012, 
our Advice-Clinic program included large-scale clinics 
conducted as part of the ABA’s National Pro Bono 
Celebration in October.  These clinics (conducted in 
Athens, Chattanooga, Cleveland, Dunlap, Gruetli-Laager, 
Jasper, Knoxville, Madisonville, Maryville, Morristown, and 
Pikeville) served hundreds of low-income people.  We will 
have similar clinics in 2013. 

Brief-Service Clinics are for clients who need 
representation at routine hearings without requiring the 
volunteer to enter an appearance for extended

NCRC is at capacity with 
their existing 7 programs 
(and 7 staff - 3 full-time/3 
part-time). They do not 
plan to launch any new 
programs in 2013. 

Needs: They really

weeks before the end 
of each quarter. They 
don't need a lot 
more.....about $5,000

Tennessee counties. They also provide 
support classes in conflict/anger 
management, teen substance abuse

that has become their specialty.  All 
mediations are free.   
NCRC provides mediation services and

The 2013 Tennessee Pro Bono Report 

Executive Summary 

 

The efforts of the Tennessee Supreme Court and the Access to Justice Commission to 
increase  pro  bono  services  and  pro  bono  reporting  are  having  an  impact  on 
Tennessee’s licensed attorneys. 

Based on information and statistics collected, attorneys have provided most of their pro 
bono  assistance  by  directly  helping  low-income  Tennesseans  with  their  legal  needs. 
Since 2010, when attorneys were first asked to voluntarily report their pro bono hours, 
Tennessee  attorneys  have  shown  they  are  generously  responding  to  the  civil  legal 
needs gap by donating more time to pro bono projects. 

In 2011, the Access to Justice Commission recommended and the Tennessee Supreme 
Court approved a streamlined Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form that has aided in the 
reporting  of  pro  bono  activity  hours  by  attorneys.  Continuing  its  support  of  pro  bono 
reporting  by  attorneys,  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  sent  a  letter  to  all  licensed 
attorneys  in  their  2012  annual  attorney  license  renewal  packets  from  the  Board  of 
Professional Responsibility, encouraging the voluntary reporting of pro bono hours.  

n 2013, 42.13% of Tennessee’s licensed attorneys reported 672,976 hours of pro bono 
work,  for  an  average  of  73.80  hours  per  attorney  reporting  pro  bono  work.  This  is 
significantly above the national average. The pro bono legal services were provided and 
reported in four categories:   

●  Legal  services  without  a  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  persons  of 

limited means; 

means; 

●  Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited 

●  Legal  services  to  groups  and  organizations  at  a  reduced  fee  when  payment  of 

standard fees would create a financial hardship; and 

●  Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, or the legal profession.

Since  2010,  the  number  of  hours  of  pro  bono  work  reported  more  than  doubled  from 
294,672 hours to 672,976 hours.  While there was a decrease in the average hours per 
attorney  from  2010  to  2013  by  5.88  hours,  there  has  been  a  dramatic  increase  in  the 
overall  amount  of  pro  bono  legal  service  in  Tennessee.    Forty-two  percent  of  all 
attorneys  voluntarily  reported  providing  pro  bono  services  during  2012.  For  those  who 
reported, the average number of pro bono hours provided per attorney was significantly 
higher  than  50  hours  during  the  year.    In  a  short  period  of  time,  the  Commission  has 
come close to achieving this goal. 

The pro bono services reporting data for this report was obtained from the Tennessee 
Board of Professional Responsibility. Organizations involved in providing legal services 
or  non-legal  services,  such  as  mediation,  were  surveyed  on  the  amount  of  pro  bono 
conducted through their organization.  The Commission on Continuing Legal Education 
and Specialization also contributed to this report.   

The  members  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Tennessee  and  the  Access  to  Justice 
Commission, thank the Tennessee licensed attorneys, legal services organizations, bar 
associations, mediators, judges, and all those involved in providing legal assistance or 
working  with  those  that  provide  legal  assistance  to  low-income  members  of  their 
communities. You have made access to justice a reality for countless Tennesseans.

Attorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics 

The  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  adopted  Supreme  Court  Rule  9,  Section  20.11  on 
November  2,  2009.  The  Rule  requests  that  every  attorney  who  is  required  to  file  an 
Annual  Registration  Statement  with  the  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  (“BPR”) 
voluntarily file a statement reporting the attorney’s pro bono service and activity during 
the last calendar year. The Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form was first included in the 
2010 BPR Registration Statement and reported data for the 2009 calendar year. 

The Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to 
require  renewals  on  the  first  day  of  each  attorney’s  birth  month.  Under  this  new 
procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until 
all reporting for that year has been received. 

The Access to Justice Commission now has pro bono reporting data for pro bono work 
reported  in  four  calendar  years,  2010  to  2013.  The  Access  to  Justice  Commission  is 
pleased  to  provide  an  analysis  of  the  2013  data  and  a  comparison  to  that  of  the 
previous three years. 

eginning in the 2013 Pro Bono Report and in all future Pro Bono Reports, the data will 
be labeled to correspond with the year the pro bono work was reported, not the year the 
pro bono work was performed.  For example, the pro bono work reported in 2013 and 
completed in 2012 will be labeled as the 2013 Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics.

2013 Statistics 

Pursuant  to  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission’s  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to 
Justice  Commission  is  focused  on  pro  bono  work  that  aids  Tennesseans.  The  2013 
statistics reflect pro bono work performed in 2012 and reported during the 2013 annual 
registration period.  The 2013 reporting form asked for feedback from attorneys in four 
categories of pro bono service.  
 

●  Legal  services  without  a  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  persons  of 

limited means; 

means; 

●  Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited 

●  Legal  services  to  groups  and  organizations  at  a  reduced  fee  when  payment  of

Overall Results 

Access to justice cannot be achieved without collaboration. The multiple partners of the 
Court  and  the  Commission  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  many  volunteers  on  the 
Commission's  numerous  committees  and  work  groups,  attorneys,  legal  services 
organizations,  bar  associations,  law  schools  and  law  students,  mediators,  judges,  and 
countless volunteers involved in providing day-to-day assistance to those needing legal 
services  within  their  communities.  The  results  of  these  efforts  are  over  650,000  pro 
bono service hours reported in 2013.

Additional Information, Data and Survey Highlights 

Bar Association Pro Bono 

Using www.surveymonkey.com, the Pro Bono Coordinator surveyed regional and local 
bar  associations  about  the  pro  bono  initiatives  and  efforts  sponsored  by  each  bar 
association. Bar association presidents were emailed a link to complete the survey. The 
Pro Bono Coordinator followed up with phone calls and emails to encourage additional 
responses. 

To  date,  23  responses  were  received  from  bar  associations.  Highlights  and  insights 
obtained  from  some  of  the  survey  responses  are  listed  below.    A  chart  detailing  pro 
bono opportunities and pro bono statistics for the bar associations is attached as Exhibit 
A.

Information 

Law School Pro Bono 

In  its  2012  Strategic  Plan,  the  Access  to  Justice  Commission  acknowledged  the 
importance of introducing pro bono services to future attorneys while they are still in law 
school. The Access to Justice Commission committed to convening meetings with law 
school deans, law school pro bono directors, and students at least annually to explore 

13 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increasing the participation of law students in pro bono activities. The Commission also 
compiled  the  pro  bono  policies  of  Tennessee  law  schools  into  one  document,  a  Pro 
Bono Policy Compilation, as a resource for Tennessee law schools and for law schools 
nationwide. 

The  ATJ  Commission  partnered  with  the  Tennessee  Bar  Association’s  Access  to 
Justice  Committee  to  sponsor  two  statewide  meetings  for  law  school  Deans,  faculty, 
and  students  to  discuss  issues  specific  to  pro  bono  work  done  by  law  students.    The 
first meeting was held at Belmont College of Law in Nashville and the second was held 
at  the  University  of  Tennessee  College  of  Law  in  Knoxville.    As  a  result  of  these 
meetings,  the  ATJ  Commission  developed  a  proposal  for  the  Supreme  Court  to 
recognize  law  student  pro  bono  work  which  the  Court  subsequently  adopted.    In 
addition, the ATJ Commission added law students to its Pro Bono Advisory Committee.  
The  Pro  Bono  Coordinator  and  ATJ  Coordinator  surveyed  the  six  law  schools  in 
Tennessee on their pro bono work done in 2013.   

Law School Survey Highlights 

●  Belmont  College  of  Law:  Thirty-five  percent  of  students  registered  pro  bono 
hours  through  the  Belmont  Legal  Aid  Society.    All  law  school  student 
organizations  must  conduct  one  public  service  project  each  academic  year  to 
remain  chartered  as  a  student  organization.    Belmont  has  partnered  with 
Magdalene House, a residential program for women who have survived lives of 
prostitution, trafficking, addiction and life on the streets.  The Magdalene House 
Legal Clinic endeavors to remove financial burdens that impede graduates from 
restarting  their  lives.    The  Clinic  guides  the  participants  through  the  process  of 
appealing  to  the  court  for  consolidation,  reduction  or  forgiveness  of  any 
outstanding court fees.  Law students assist attorneys as they draft motions and 
appear with the client in court to request debt forgiveness or reduction.   

●  Duncan  School  of  Law:  Law  students  are  required  to  complete  30  hours  of  pro 
bono  services  to  graduate.  Each  member  of  the  faculty  is  required  to  complete 
20 hours of pro bono per year to be considered for tenure. 

●  University of Tennessee: This law school offers seven different clinical programs. 
UT Pro Bono, a student-run organization, handles pro bono projects with faculty 
and  administrative  support.  Thirty-eight  percent  of  students  participated  in  pro 
bono activities in 2013.  All students are encouraged to give at least 50 hours of 
pro  bono  service  over  the  course  of  their  law  school  careers.    The  school  is 
planning to implement AccessKnoxville, a program designed to offer analysis and 
advice on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).   

14 
 

15 
 

  University of Memphis: The Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law has a graduation 
requirement of 40 hours of pro bono work.  The school defines pro bono service 
as  law-related  public  service  that  a  student  provides  without  compensation  or 
academic  credit.    The  law  school  partnered  with  a  host  of  organizations  in 
Memphis  including  but  not  limited  to  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services,  the 
Community  Legal  Center,  the  Public  Defender’s  and  District  Attorney’s  offices, 
the  MidSouth  Peace  and  Justice  Center,  the  Volunteer  Income  Taxpayer’s 
Assistance  Program  (VITA),and  Youth  Court.    Memphis  law  students  assisted 
the ATJ Commission directly by drafting plain language scripts for videos on how 
to  complete  plain  language  divorce  forms  and  translation  the  Supplemental 
Guidelines  and  Helpful  Information for  People  with  a  Case  in  General  Sessions 
Court into Spanish.   

  ●

●  Vanderbilt  University:  This  law  school  offers  five  different  clinical  programs.  Pro 
bono  organizations  include  Vanderbilt  Legal  Aid  Society  and  Law  Students  for 
Social Justice. Externship programs, stipends for internships, and post-graduate 
stipends are available, as well as loan repayment assistance. 

Legal Service Providers – Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”)-Funded 

In  Tennessee,  there  are  four  legal  aid  providers  that  receive  federal  funding  from  the 
Legal Services Corporation(“LSC”): Legal Aid of East Tennessee, Legal Aid Society of 
Middle  Tennessee  and  the  Cumberlands,  Memphis  Area  Legal  Services,  and  West 
Tennessee Legal  Services.  In  October  2011,  the  Access to  Justice  Commission  Chair 
and  the  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  met  with  the  executive  directors  of  these 
organizations  to  begin  an  ongoing  discussion  about  how  the  Access  to  Justice 
Commission and the LSC-funded legal aid providers can collaborate to increase the pro 
bono assistance provided by Tennessee attorneys. The Access to Justice Commission 
Chair now holds quarterly conference calls with these directors. 

According to federal regulations, LSC-funded legal aid providers must use at least 12.5 
percent of their LSC funds for Private Attorney Involvement (pro bono). Each of the four 
LSC-funded  organizations  has  a  Pro  Bono  Coordinator/Director.  The  coordinators 
provide  a  wide  range  of  services  and  interact  with  a  variety  of  partners  to  provide 
assistance  to  substantial  numbers  of  clients.  These  services  range  from  arranging 
classic attorney-client representation to providing unbundled services. The coordinators 
also provide support services for pro bono activities such as intake, referrals to a variety 
of programs, continuing legal education, malpractice coverage, legal clinics, partnering

with  bar  associations  to  highlight  the  profession’s  commitment  to  access  to  justice, 
recognition activities, and numerous other activities. 

General  information  gathered  from  the  four  LSC-funded  organizations’  directors  and 
websites  is  provided  below.  A  chart  detailing  pro  bono  opportunities  and  pro  bono 
statistics for the organizations is attached as Exhibit B.

Center  and  LAET  office).  There  are  Pro  Bono  Directors  in  the  Knoxville  and 
Chattanooga offices.  
 

•  Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands (LAS): LAS serves 
48  Tennessee  counties  with  its  eight  offices:  Clarksville,  Columbia,  Cookeville, 
Gallatin,  Murfreesboro,  Nashville,  Oak  Ridge,  and  Tullahoma.  To  qualify  for 
assistance 
the

children, housing and real property, consumer issues, individual and civil rights, 
health and income maintenance, and seniors. 

•  West Tennessee Legal Services (WTLS): WTLS serves Benton, Carroll, Chester, 
Crockett,  Dyer,  Decatur,  Gibson,  Hardeman,  Hardin,  Haywood,  Henry, 
Henderson,  Lake,  McNairy,  Madison,  Obion,  and  Weakley  counties.  Its  main 
office  is  in  Jackson,  with  offices  in  Dyersburg,  Huntingdon,  and  Selmer.  It  has 
one part-time Pro Bono Director/Coordinator. WTLS accepts the following types 
of  civil  cases:  access  to  health/medical  care,  securing  or  retaining  housing, 
ensuring  compliance  with  Fair  Housing  Laws,  securing  or  retaining  income, 
personal  freedom  and  security  rights,  parental  rights  with  state  action,  rights  of 
persons  in  institutions,  freedom  of  all  persons  from  abuse,  family  issues, 
education  rights,  consumer  rights,  and  community  education.  WTLS  does  not 
accept  cases  with  the  potential  of  a  high  monetary  judgment  or  adult  criminal 
cases. 

Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC-Funded 

In Tennessee, there are many legal service providers that do not receive funding from 
the  Legal  Services  Corporation.  The  Tennessee  Access  to  Justice  Commission 
considers  any  organization  that  does  not  receive  funding  from  the  Legal  Services 
Corporation  a  non-LSC-funded  legal  service  provider.  Non-LSC-funded  organizations 
can  serve  segments  of  the  population  and  handle  legal  matters  that  LSC-funded 
providers  cannot.  Non-LSC-funded  organizations  do  not  have  to follow  federal  income 
guidelines to determine if a person is eligible to receive legal services.  

The Commission has gathered data from the following non-LSC providers:, Community 
Legal Center, Disability Law & Advocacy Center, Southeast Tennessee Legal Services, 
Southern  Migrant  Legal  Services,  Tennessee  Coalition  to  End  Domestic  and  Sexual 
Violence,  the  Tennessee  Justice  Center,  and  Tennessee  Volunteer  Lawyers  and 
Professionals  for  the  Arts.  A  chart  detailing  the  pro  bono  opportunities  and  pro  bono 
statistics of each provider is attached as Exhibit C. 

ennessee Faith & Justice Alliance Members   

he Tennessee  Faith and  Justice  Alliance  (TFJA)  is  a program  developed by  the ATJ 
Commission to support and encourage faith-based groups in Tennessee who commit to 
providing  legal  resources  to  their  congregations  and  communities.    It’s  one  of  the  first 
programs of its kind in the country created to align needs seen at the local church level 

    T

with  possible  legal  resources  that  are  nearby,  perhaps  even  within  the  same 
congregation.  The notion is to connect with people in need in a place they already go to 
seek help with a problem. That place is quite often their place of worship. 

he  pilot  project  involved  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United  Methodist  Church. 
Church  leaders  and  volunteer  attorneys  gathered  to  learn  more  about  the  program, 
assign attorneys to congregations, and receive training on how the program works. The 
United Methodist Church’s TFJA project is designed to pair an attorney with a place of 
worship.  When  a  leader  or  clergy  member  of  that  congregation  learns  of  a  member’s 
legal  need,  that  leader  can  then  refer  the  person  to  the  local  attorney  who  has 
volunteered  to  serve  as  a  resource  to  that  congregation.  That  attorney  in  turn  will 
provide  the  legal  advice  needed,  or  make  connections  with  other  resources  that  can 
provide the necessary services.  

he TFJA program, which has plans to expand to all faiths and geographic areas of the 
state,  is  flexible  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  particular  community.  The  UMC  model  is  just 
one  way  to  offer  services.  Other  organizations  may  consider  monthly  legal  clinics  or 
other offerings.  For example, a church in Nashville organized legal teams that partner 
with  addiction  rehabilitation  organizations.    These  legal  teams  work  with  program 
graduates to deal with outstanding legal issues that may impede the graduates’ success 
after  their  rehabilitation.    Another  example  is  a  clinic  started  at Lipscomb  University,  a 
Christian  institution.    The  Lipscomb  Institute  for  Law,  Justice  and  Society  recruited 
alumni  attorneys  to  serve  at  bi-monthly  free  walk-in  legal  clinics.    The  Pro  Bono 
Coordinator surveyed member organizations of the TFJA about the pro bono initiatives 
and efforts sponsored by each organization.  A chart containing information about each 
TFJA member, including its pro bono statistics, is attached as Exhibit D. 

FJA Survey Highlights 

•  Compassionate  Counsel,  a  501(c)(3)  organization  based  out  of  Nashville, 
operated  legal  clinics  in  Davidson  County  and  serve  clients  who  contact  them 
directly with civil legal issues.   
 

•  Cross  Point  Church  Legal  Program  has  twenty-five  volunteers  and  served  over 
twenty clients during its first two legal clinics.  The Church also has Legal Teams 
that  partner  with  addiction  rehabilitation  organizations  and  work  with  program 
graduates to deal with outstanding legal issues that may impede the graduates’ 
success after rehabilitation.

Law Offices with Pro Bono Policies 

or the first time, law offices that have adopted pro bono policies were surveyed for the 
annual pro bono report.  As part of its 2012 Strategic Plan, the Commission set a goal to 
increase  the  number  of  law  offices  with  pro  bono  policies  by  fifteen.    When  the 
Commission  set  this  goal,  there  were  approximately  fifty  law  offices  across  the  state 
with  pro  bono  policies.    As  of  December  31,  2013,  sixty-six  law  offices  in  Tennessee 
have  adopted  pro  bono  policies.    The  Pro  Bono  Coordinator  surveyed  the  law  offices 
with pro bono policies and seventeen law offices responded to the survey.

Supreme Court Rule 31 Mediator Pro Bono and Mediation Center Pro Bono 

Supreme  Court  Rule  31  is  a  system  where  litigants,  courts,  and  attorneys  can  locate 
qualified  alternative  dispute  resolution  mediators  and  other  neutrals  and  enlist  their 
assistance in resolving matters pending before courts of record.  Rule 31 does not affect 
dispute  resolution  programs  or  individual  cases  that  are  resolved  outside  the  Rule  31 
system.  The Rule was set up to assist the court in obtaining a mediator or other neutral 
when  the  court  or  the  parties  want  one.    Rule  31  also  established  the  Alternative 
Dispute Resolution Commission that devised a way that ADR neutrals could be trained 
and approved for use by the courts.  The Rule provides required credentials and training 
for  mediators  who  wish  to  be  listed  as  a  Supreme  Court  Rule  31  Mediator.    Rule  31

Mediators  are  required  to  file  a  report  after  every  mediation  they  conduct  providing 
general information on the mediation.  The mediator must report whether the mediation 
was  done  pro  bono.    In  2013,  Rule  31  Mediators  reported  conducting  350  pro  bono 
mediations.  There were four additional court-ordered pro bono mediations reported in 
2013.        

In  Tennessee,  some  counties  have  mediation  centers  offering  free  or  reduced-fee 
mediation services to people who cannot afford a mediator. The Administrative Office of 
the  Courts  has  limited  funding from  the  General  Assembly  to  assist  mediation centers 
that  apply  for  and  meet  grant  criteria.  The  grants  are  designed  to  help  low-income 
Tennesseans access mediation services. 

The  Commission  has  gathered  data  from  the  following  mediation  center  providers: 
Community  Mediation  Center,  Family  Court  Services  of  East  Tennessee,  Nashville 
Conflict  Resolution  Center,  Southeast  Tennessee  Human  Resources  Agency,  The 
Mediation Center (Columbia).

ennessee is making great strides in encouraging more attorneys to provide more 
hours of pro bono each year.   This pro bono report demonstrates the impact of pro

The Commission urges attorneys to continue to track and report the many activities

believe that this program has been greatly 
successful and the libraries and their staff have been 
great to work with. The libraries have also expressed 
great appreciation as they have indicated to us that 
they receive numerous legal questions.  

•  We are also seeing that many more questions on

close to 300 free estate planning documents to

encouraged this year to volunteer at pro bono clinics 
and to take pro bono representation from their local 
legal aid offices. We do know of regular clinics being 
promoted and organized by TBA YLD member

and also sitting down to train the libraries 
on how each of these programs work and 
to answer any questions that they may 
have. In my experience, we have also had 
persons at the library who were interested 
and we walked them through the online 
justice site along with the LIFT website 
and they were very happy to have access 
to these forms of pro bono legal 
assistance. It is our goal to have trained 
one library in each county on these pro 
bono resources prior to June of 2014. We 
hope that this work lays the foundation for 
years to come for pro bono legal 
resources in libraries across the state. I 
would be amiss not to mention the work of 
the librarians in implementing this project. 
They have been more than helpful and 
excited to learn about these resources 
and to educate the public about them as 
well.

approximately 50 advice or brief-service clinics. 
560 lawyers, over 120 law students, and about a 
dozen interpreters, court reporters, mediators, 
and other professionals participated. 

In collaboration with Baker, Donelson, Bearman, 
Caldwell & Berkowitz, we co-sponsor the Project HELP 
at a local homeless shelter. In collaboration with the 
Barristers (Young Lawyer Division of the Knoxville Bar 
Association), we co-sponsored the first of a series of 
clinics for veterans seeking health and disability 
benefits. We created a clinic in which volunteer lawyers 
meet with clients in our Northern Region to prepare 
and execute wills and powers of attorney at the clinic.

Through 2013, each of the 8 offices of LAS managed 
its pro bono program separately. In the 7 offices 
outside of Nashville, staff identified cases for which no 
staff resources were available and which appropriate 
for referral to pro bono lawyers. In our Murfreesboro 
office LAS staff worked with pro bono lawyers at a 
weekly legal advice clinic and in Oak Ridge a monthly 
legal advice clinic was established where pro bono 
lawyers worked with UT law students to provide legal 
help.  

For Davidson and Williamson Counties, the Nashville 
Pro Bono Program administered the pro bono work. 
Clients were identified through referrals from the LAS 
staff, intake in substantive areas law not routinely 
handled by staff at LAS, referrals from partner 
agencies including the YW, Nashville Financial 
Empowerment Center and Catholic Charities, and 
attendance at legal advice clinics.

The Nashville Pro Bono Program worked in 

Beginning in January 2014, the Nashville 
Pro Bono program was dissolved and 
LAS established a regional Volunteer 
Lawyers Program. LAS staff has been 
working to identify significant unmet legal 
needs of clients which LAS does not 
have staff resources to address. LAS is 
developing strategies to meet these 
needs building on the Pillar Firm Model 
and creating an Urban-Rural Initiative. 

There is one urban-rural partnership in 
place already to provide legal help to 
clients in rural counties served by LAS’ 
Gallatin office. Other projects include 
both extending help throughout the 
service area through the existing 
Bankruptcy Project and training lawyers 
to provide help through a SSI Cessation 
Project and Caregiver Project The VLP is 
also planning a new partnership with

•  We provide civil legal services to the"working poor", 
people whose income falls between 125% of poverty 
and a living wage for Memphis. We also do immigration 
work for people in the jurisdiction of the immigration 
court in Memphis (TN, AR, N MS, W KY) whose 
income falls below 125% of poverty. 

•  We specialize in family law, consumer, debt collection, 
immigration, landlord tenant, advanced directives, 
probate, conservatorships 

• 

In addition to our regular ongoing program of assigning 
clients to pro bono attorneys to represent them, we 
participated in the University of Memphis Law School's 
Alternative Spring Break program for the 3rd year. We 
conducted both the family law tract in which law 
students worked with over 20 divorce litigants who 
eventually filed for pro se divorces and the Immigrant 
Justice Program of the CLC worked with 6 law students 
to file 23 DACA applications which are still being 
approved. 

•  We plan to continue the two pro bono 
projects we have currently. In the 13 
years I've been at CLC we have seen 
the number of cases we assign grow 
from an average of 6 per month to a 
current average of 28 total cases per 
month, with 10 - 12 of these 28 being 
assigned to pro bono attorneys. There 
are new programs in place to provide 
referrals and advice, but we see a 
continuing need for representation. 
Therefore, our emphasis in on continuing 
our primary pro bono project of assigning 
attorneys to cases and even increase the 
number of clients we are able to serve 
through it. 

•  ATJC: We appreciate the work that you 
are doing. I have served on the state 
Access to Justice Committee for 
approximately 9 years and we have 
struggled with a number of issues such 
as trying to get attorneys to do pro bono 
work. In the short time the Commission 
has been in existence, it has expedited 
this process by quantum leaps. With this 
and other issues, it makes such a great 
difference for people with the clout the 
Commission has to champion access to 
justice causes. From my perception, this 
model of having the Commission 
advocate for access to justice for the 
poor is moving us forward rapidly.

The VLPA program provides pro bono legal assistance

and emerging non-profit arts organizations in the 
greater Nashville area. We work to ensure access to 
effective legal counsel for artists and arts organizations 
with limited resources, to educate the community on 
arts-related business and legal issues, and to foster 
and strengthen cooperative relationships between the 
creative and legal communities. 

•  Had two clinics this year and used our pro bono 
volunteers to help clients with their cases.  

•  Future plans: possibly additional 
clinics both in Nashville and 
Chattanooga 

•  Needs: A grant to pay travel expenses 
for volunteers to go training and host 
clinics in other cities. For example, 
Chattanooga has the client needs and 
lawyers willing to volunteer, but need 
arts-specific training. We do not have the 
budget to pay for transportation to get 
our volunteers there and not all can pay 
out-of-pocket. 

 

     

They operate legal clinics out of the Nashville 
Rescue Mission as well as serve clients who 
contact them with civil legal issues. 

Also, Legal Teams from Cross Point Church in 
Nashville partner with addiction rehabilitation 
organizations.  The legal teams work with 
program graduates to deal with outstanding 
legal issues that may impede the graduates’ 
success after their rehabilitation. The legal 
teams are comprised of lawyers and law 
students who attend Cross Point.  The law 
students complete client intake, do legal 
research and draft motions, while the attorney 
oversee their work.  This allows the law 
students to get hands-on experience, and 
makes the time commitment for the attorneys 
more manageable.  

So far they gone through one round of Mending 
Hearts court cost forgiveness hearings.  During 
the first round, they have over $20,000 of court 
costs for 4 clients completely forgiven!

The UMC Initiative is composed of lawyers 
within local congregations who have committed 
to work with the pro bono legal issues that 
come to the attention of the local clergy. From 
now on, when a legal need arises within the 
church, it will no longer be the job of the church 
staff to find the appropriate resources to meet 
that need, but instead you will assume that 
referral role. Once you receive a referral from 
your local pastor, it is then your responsibility to 
either take the case or refer the case to the 
appropriate resource.

forward, however they are extremely 
limited.

non-profit community mediation 
centers, advocating for more support 
from the Judiciary so that the 
centers can have wide-scale impact 
on low-income residents in 
Tennessee. (Legal aid agencies 
receive a great deal more state 
funding, for example.) I request that 
the ATJ Commission emphasize in 
the Annual Report that participation 
in pro bono mediation services 
(either through a community 
mediation center or as a solo 
practitioner) earns attorney-
mediators free CLE credit (per 
Supreme Court Rule 21, Section 
4.07(c) and OUTLINE the steps that 
attorney-mediators must take to 
receive that credit. I am certain that 
attorney-mediators either do not 
know about this or are resistant to 
engaging in pro bono mediation 
because of a desire to benefit 
financially from mediation practice. 
The ATJ Commission should be the 
leader of public discourse on pro 
bono mediation, pushing for 
incentives that will encourage ease 
of participation. Otherwise, what 
momentum is there to truly serve the 
poor??

I.  Introduction 

In August 2008, the Tennessee Supreme Court declared Access to Justice its number one 

strategic priority, and, later that year, launched its Access to Justice campaign.  On April 3, 2009, 

the Court created the Tennessee Access to Justice Commission and charged it with developing its 

first  strategic  plan  within  a  year  and  updating  the  plan  every  two  years  thereafter.      The  2012 

Plan  details  the  progress  in  implementing  the  goals  of  the  Commission’s  initial  2010  Strategic 

Plan.   The 2012 Plan also addresses new objectives and benchmarks to address the civil legal 

needs crisis.   

The 2010 Plan outlined how the Supreme Court began its Access to Justice Initiative and 

the Court’s impressive efforts to carry out this initiative.  During the past two years, the Court’s 

commitment has never waivered and indeed, has intensified.  The Court—as individual justices 

and as a whole—participates in access to justice events and meetings of the Commission and its 

Advisory  Committee, makes  prompt  decisions  to  promote  the  initiative  and  speaks  locally  and 

nationally  on  this  topic.    The  leadership  and  visibility  of  the  Court  has  not  only  inspired  the 

Commission, but also inspired and galvanized the broader access to justice community, the bar 

and its associations, the judiciary and the court system as a whole. 

The 2010 Plan set forth four overarching goals and identified strategic ways for the Court 

and Commission to accomplish these goals.  This 2012 Plan updates the 2010 Plan by identifying 

the initiatives and accomplishments of the Supreme Court and the Commission during the past 

two  years.      These  accomplishments  reflect  the  dedication  and  support  of  a  broad  network  of 

lawyers, law firms, corporate legal departments, bar associations, legal service programs, judges, 

clerks,  law  schools,  librarians,  service  providers,  nonprofits,  faith–based  organizations  and 

businesses to accomplish these goals.    

1 

   

   

 

The 2012 Plan also sets forth additional goals and initiatives that will aid and expedite 

the Supreme Court’s dynamic and ongoing Access to Justice Campaign.   In particular, the 2012 

Plan focuses on the Commission’s first goal, which is to involve more lawyers and law students 

in meeting legal needs so that the public is better served.  Key to the implementation of this goal 

is  supporting  the  development  of  a  more  comprehensive  pro  bono  delivery  system  across  the 

state.      The  2012  Plan  also  addresses  the  necessity  of  further  outreach  and  public  awareness 

regarding  access  to  justice  resources  to  self-represented  individuals  and  to  the  community  at 

II.   Accomplishments and Highlights of the 2010 Plan.  

t  each  quarterly  meeting,  the  Commission  reviewed  the  2010  Plan  (Appendix  I)  and 

received an update regarding how the Commission was proceeding towards accomplishing these 

goals.    The  most  recent  2010  Strategic  Plan  Quarterly  Update  is  attached  to  this  Plan  in 

Appendix E.   As set forth in the update, the Commission met most of its goals and considered 

which goals were unmet and needed to be pursued for the 2012 Plan.   Some of the highlights of 

  A

large.   

the accomplishments of the 2010 Plan are: 

          A.      Pro Bono Summit.  The Supreme Court and the Commission sponsored a Pro Bono  

Summit in Nashville on January 21, 2011.  All five members of the Court addressed the Summit 

and  attended  the  day-long  conference.    Bar  association  officers,  law  firm  managing  partners, 

rural practitioners, corporate counsel, deans of Tennessee law schools, law students, legal service 

providers, representatives from the state libraries, and other service providers also attended the 

Summit, which focused on increasing pro bono service performed by Tennessee attorneys.   

The  Summit  offered  a  variety  of  panel  discussions  including  guidance  on  developing  a 

pro bono clinic, how to increase attorney pro bono at large law firms and corporations, specific 

2 

   

issues  that  arise  in  rural  areas,  best  practices  for  involving  law  students  in  pro  bono  work  and 

ways  that  technology  helps  attorneys  reach  more  indigent  Tennesseans.    All  sessions  were 

recorded  and  made  available  online.    Participants  completed  pledge  cards  stating  how  they 

planned  to  increase  pro  bono  in  their  practice,  and  the  ATJ  Coordinator  followed  up  with 

participants to assist in carrying out these pledges.  New ideas and partnerships were formed as a 

result  of  the  Summit,  including  coordination  among  law  school  pro  bono  programs,  ideas  for 

uses  of  technology  in  the  rural  communities  and  introduction  of  the  ATJ  website, 

OnlineTNJustice.org and the Appellate Pro Bono Project.    

B.      Access  to  Justice  Website.      In  November  2011,  the  Supreme  Court  launched 

www.JusticeForAllTN.com.    The  user-friendly  website  has  an  innovative  and  effective  dual 

purpose of providing information both to the public and the bar.  Viewers who click “legal help” 

can find information on how to find a lawyer, a glossary of common legal terms, links to court 

forms  and  plain  language  information  on  a  variety  of  legal  issues,  including  divorce,  child 

support, housing information, healthcare, immigration, and mediation.  One of the most popular 

tools  on  the  site  is  an  interactive  map  of  Tennessee’s  95  counties  where  users  are  directed  to 

county-specific  contact 

information  for 

legal  aid  providers,  social  service  providers, 

governmental agencies and the court system.  For lawyers and other website visitors who click “I 

can help,” the site provides information ranging from how to volunteer with a legal aid provider 

or a bar association to a step-by-step guide for how to develop a pro bono clinic.  (Appendix H).  

C.      Supreme Court Rules.  A key component of the 2010 Plan was working with the 

Supreme  Court  to  adopt  rule  changes  that  eliminate  barriers  to  pro  bono  service  and  pro  se 

representation.  The Court, the Access to Justice Commission, and many strategic partners have 

made great strides in this area.  The Supreme Court has: 

3 

   

•  Adopted Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 50A to establish an emeritus attorney licensure 
status allowing attorneys with inactive licenses to provide pro bono legal services through 
an  established  not-for-profit  bar  association,  pro  bono  program,  or  legal  services 
program; 
 

•  Adopted  Tennessee  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  72  to  permit  unsworn  declarations  made 
under  penalty  of  perjury  to  be  filed  in  lieu  of  an  affidavit  or  sworn  declaration, 
eliminating unnecessary barriers for persons of limited means to court system;  

•  Amended  Tennessee  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  11(b)(1)  to  require  judges  to  inform 
criminal  defendants  in  the  plea  colloquy  that  a  guilty  plea  may  have  immigration 
consequences;  

•  Adopted Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 52 to provide a process for and approve forms 

that are universally acceptable as legally sufficient in all Tennessee courts;  

•  Revised Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 9, Section 20.11 to streamline the voluntary pro 
bono  reporting  statement  included  in  the  annual  Tennessee  Board  of  Professional 
Responsibility attorney licensure renewal statement;  

•  Revised  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule  41  to  request  court  interpreters  to  aspire  to 

provide pro bono interpretive services each year;  

•  Revised  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  Rule  42  to  provide  that  if  the  court  determines  a 
participant  has  a  limited  ability  to  understand  and  communicate  in  English,  the  court 
should appoint an interpreter, write a summary of the court’s efforts to obtain a certified 
or registered interpreter and determine the capabilities of the proposed non-credentialed 
interpreter in open court;  
 

•  Amended Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 5.02 to provide instruction on how to serve 
notice  when  an  attorney  is  providing  limited  scope  representation  to  an  otherwise  self-
represented party; and  

•  Amended Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 11.01 to provide the procedures by which 
attorneys  providing  limited  scope  representation  to  an  otherwise  self-represented  party 
shall notify the court of the limited scope representation and how attorneys may withdraw 
from the matter once the limited scope representation is complete.  

   D.        Plain  Language  Forms.    Pursuant  to  the  adoption  of  Supreme  Court  Rule  52,  the 

Court  has  approved  plain  language  forms  drafted  at  a  fifth  to  eighth  grade  reading  level  to  be 

used  by  those  seeking  uncontested  divorces  that  do  not  involve  minor  children  or  significant 

marital  assets.  Also  provided  is  a  packet  of  instructions  on  how  to  complete  and  file  the 

4 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

uncontested divorce forms with the court.  The forms went into effect on September 1, 2011, and 

have  been  positively  received  by  the  public,  the  judiciary,  and  attorneys.    Spurred  on  by  the 

Commission,  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts  (“AOC”)  converted  its  existing  Order  of 

Protection  forms  into  plain  language  and  translated  these  forms  into  Spanish.    The  Supreme 

Court  has  also  developed  a  second  packet  of  plain  language  forms  commonly  used  in  General 

Sessions Court.  Those forms have been submitted for public comment.  

E.        Commission  Advisory  Committees.      The  Commission  formed  seven  Advisory 

Committees to carry out its goals, each headed by one or more Commissioners.  These Advisory 

ach advisory committee was charged with work toward achieving the four over-arching goals 

outlined  in  the  2010  Strategic  Plan.  The  Chairs  provided  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the 

Commission. 

  Each  committee  made  substantive  contributions 

toward  achieving 

the 

Commission’s goals.   

1. 

Disability  and  Language  Barriers.    The  Disability  and  Language  Barriers 

Advisory Committee recommended that the AOC form an Interpreter Work Group.   This group 

examines Supreme Court Rules to identify ways to incorporate technology, such as remote court 

interpreting, in order to better serve Tennesseans with limited English proficiency.  Based upon 

the  recommendation  of  this  Advisory  Committee  and  the  Interpreter  Work  Group,  the 

Commission  recommended  changes  to  Rules  41  and  42,  which  were  adopted  by  the  Supreme 

5 

  E

   

Committees were:   

o  Disability and Language Barriers 
o  Education/Public Awareness 
o  Faith-Based Initiatives 
o  Pro Bono 
o  Pro Se/Forms 
o  Resources 
o  Technology. 

Court.    The  Committee  and  the  Commission  also  continue  to  encourage  and  monitor  the 

translation  of  forms  and  ATJ  website  information  into  Spanish  and  other  languages.    The 

Advisory  Committee  assisted  the  AOC  in  developing  the  content  regarding  interpreters, 

immigration, and assistance for Tennesseans with disabilities for the ATJ website.   

 

2.     Education/Public Awareness.   One of the most significant accomplishments of the 

Education/Public Awareness Advisory Committee is its development of the “Pro Bono Clinic in 

a Box” forms, prominently featured at both the Pro Bono Summit and the ATJ website.  These 

forms allow a bar association or informal group of attorneys to create a pro bono advice clinic 

complete  with  informational  handouts  for  volunteers  and  clients,  intake  sheets,  and  marketing 

and  public  relations  information.    The  Advisory  Committee  also  recommended  changes  to 

Supreme Court Rule 31 which would educate mediators on pro bono mediation opportunities and 

promote  pro  bono  and  reduced  fee  mediation  services  to  judges  and  court  clerks.    The 

Commission has approved these recommendations and forwarded them to the Supreme Court’s 

Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission for consideration.   

3.      Faith-Based  Initiatives.    The  Commission  established  the  Faith-Based  Initiatives 

Committee  in  recognition  that  the  faith-based  community  is  an  untapped  point  of  access  for 

people  who  need  help  and  a  valuable  resource  for  attorneys  and  legal  professionals  who  are 

active in their faith-based organizations.  The Committee began its outreach with the Tennessee 

and  Memphis  Conferences  of  the  United  Methodist  Church,  which  already  have  established 

social justice programs.  The Commission Chair, the Chief Justice, and Committee members are 

working with the District Superintendents of these Conferences to incorporate pro bono lawyers 

into  congregational  care,  legal  clinics  and  the  church’s  social  justice  programs.    The  District 

6 

   

Superintendents have approved the plan attached in Appendix J, and the Committee hopes that 

this partnership can be used as a model to reach out to other faith-based communities.   

4.     Pro Bono.  The Pro Bono Advisory Committee was instrumental in planning and 

participating  in  the  Pro  Bono  Summit.    Through  the  work  of  this  Committee,  the  Commission 

eliminated the lack of malpractice insurance for attorneys doing pro bono through organizations 

that do not receive federal funds from the Legal Services Corporation.  The Committee was also 

the  catalyst  for  many  of  the  Commission’s  recommended  Supreme  Court  Rule  changes  to 

promote  and  encourage  more  pro  bono  work,  including  the  rules  regarding  limited  scope 

representation and the streamlined voluntary pro bono reporting form. The Committee actively 

encouraged  and  promoted  OnlineTNJustice.org  and  the  Appellate  Pro  Bono  Project  and  asked 

the Court to encourage more pro bono reporting by including a letter from the Chief Justice in 

the annual attorney renewal packet.  The Committee further addressed ways in which the Court 

encouraged attorneys employed in the judicial branch to participate in pro bono work.  

 

5.        Pro  Se/Forms.    The  Pro  Se  Representation/Forms  Committee  took  a  pro-active 

approach  to  the  direct  provision  of  legal  and  educational  resources.    The  Committee 

recommended  a  process  for  approval  by  the  Commission  and  the  Supreme  Court  for  the 

development of plain language forms which are legally sufficient for acceptance in all Tennessee 

courts.      Additionally,  the  members  of  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Commission  and  Advisory 

Committee members have participated in many educational programs for judges and court clerks 

on  the  newly-developed  forms  and  guidelines.    The  first  approved  form,  which  concerns 

“simple”  uncontested  divorces,  was  the  product  of  a  long,  thoughtful  process  attempting  to 

balance  the  need  for  legal  representation  with  the  reality  that  not  every  person  can  (or  will) 

engage an attorney to give advice on an activity that has such important legal ramifications.   The 

7 

   

Committee is presently developing plain language forms for use in General Sessions Court.  In 

addition  to  the  creation  of  forms,  the  Committee  recommended  guidance  for  court  staff  and 

judges who encounter self-represented parties.  The result has been tools such as “Guidelines for 

Tennessee  Clerks  Who  Assist  Self-Represented  Litigants”  and  a  Bench  Book  for  General 

Sessions Judges presiding over proceedings with self-represented litigants.  The Bench Book was 

presented to the General Sessions Judges Conference in February 2012.    

 

6.            Resources.    The  Resource Advisory  Committee  focused  on  increasing  access  to 

justice by increasing resources.  Mindful of increasingly restricted funding sources, however, the 

Committee’s  approach  was  a  deliberate  attempt  at  maximizing  existing  monetary  and 

nonmonetary  resources.  The  Commission  has  also  approved  the  Committee’s  proposal  to 

strengthen  its  relationship  with  the  state  libraries  through  its  partnership  with  the  Tennessee 

Alliance for Legal Services (“TALS”) and to create a new partnership with the Tennessee Board 

of  Regents  to  use  its  Technology  Centers  across  the  state  as  self-help  centers.    As  part  of  the 

Commission’s  overall  approval  of  the  Committee’s  recommendations  for  the  2012  Plan,  the 

Commission  approved  working  with  existing  funding  providers,  such  as  the  Tennessee  Bar 

Foundation,  to  emphasize  components  of  the  2012  plan  in  the  factors  for  selecting  grant 

recipients.  (Appendix  L).  Based  on  the  Committee’s  recommendation,  the  Commission  has 

approved further study of the current IOLTA and Cy Pres Rules to determine how to maximize 

funding for pro bono and legal aid services.   

 

7.     Technology.  The Technology Advisory Committee unveiled OnlineTNJustice.org 

and  presented  the  Court’s  access  to  justice  website,  JusticeForAllTN.com  at  the  Pro  Bono 

Summit.    In  response  to  the  identified  need  for  outreach  specific  to  Tennessee’s  rural 

communities,  the  Committee  worked  on  using  technological  advances  to  connect  rural 

8 

   

Tennesseans  with  attorneys  in  suburban  and  urban  areas.    Two  pilot  projects  grew  from  this 

endeavor.  The first provides automating forms frequently used by attorneys providing pro bono 

services through a legal services provider.  The second pilot project created an online screening 

system for Tennesseans applying for pro bono help from the Legal Aid Society.  The screening 

system facilitates an initial eligibility determination by sending the potential client’s application 

to the local legal aid office.  Legal Aid then connects eligible clients with a pro bono attorney.  

This project is particularly helpful in areas where potential clients would otherwise be forced to 

travel long distances to reach a Legal Aid Office, as many offices serve multiple rural counties.  

The Committee also analyzed the Washington State Access to Justice Technology Principles and 

recommended  a  modified  version  of  these  Technology  Principles,  which  the  Commission 

approved as part of its 2012 Plan.  (Appendix K).  Each Advisory Committee should adhere to 

the Technology Principles when developing new initiatives and pilot projects.   

III.   Summary of Recommendations of the 2012 Plan. 

The first goal in the Commission’s 2010 Plan was to better serve the public by involving 

more lawyers and law students in meeting legal needs.  The Commission, working in conjunction 

with the  Court, made  significant  strides.    Revisions  to  Supreme  Court  Rules—particularly the 

limited scope representation rule—helped eliminate barriers to pro bono work.  Additionally, the 

pledges of increased participation stemming from the Pro Bono Summit helped large law firms, 

corporate law firms, and solo practitioners “plug in” to pro bono service.  The development of 

the  Pro  Bono  Clinic  in  a  Box  and  the  innovative  use  of  technology  have  created  new  ways  to 

connect  lawyers  with  clients.    The  Commission  recognizes,  however,  that  there  is  still  much 

work to do. 

9 

 

 

   

 

In  drafting  the  2012  Plan,  the  Commission  took  a  hard  look  at  what  needs  to  be 

accomplished to increase the access of Tennesseans to quality representation.  The Commission 

recognizes  that  maintaining  the  status  quo  is  not  an  option.  While  increasing  the  educational 

resources  available  to  self-represented  persons  undoubtedly  provides  a  useful  and  necessary 

service,  the  Commission’s  findings  have  underscored  the  importance  of  quality  legal 

representation.    Thus,  providing  quality  representation  to  indigent  Tennesseans  and  creating 

better  ways  to  connect  clients  with  lawyers  is  the  primary  objective  of  the  2012  Plan.  The 

Commission  set  a  goal  that  50%  of  attorneys  residing  in  Tennessee  will  provide  pro  bono 

services  as  defined  by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  at  an  average  of  50  hours  per  year  on  or 

before January 1, 2015.  

 

Three  years into the Access  to Justice Campaign, Tennessee  is becoming  a  model state 

for  the  delivery  of  pro  bono  legal  services.    The  support  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  the 

established  access  to  justice  partnerships  provide  a  solid  foundation.    Moving  forward,  the 

Commission will continue developing strategies to provide quality representation and access to 

justice and will launch new initiatives to support those strategies.  Attorney education, attorney 

recruitment, client education, removal of barriers and lawyer-client connections will continue to 

be areas of special attention.   However, it is equally important to develop systems to measure 

the impact of our programs and adjust goals accordingly.   

As an initial step toward measuring the need for pro bono and the resources available, the 

Commission  asked  Access  to  Justice  Coordinator  Anne-Louise  Wirthlin  to  compile  a 

comprehensive report of all the pro bono activities in Tennessee.  The result is “The Pro Bono 

Report.” (Appendix G). Using the Pro Bono Report to establish a baseline for measurement in 

10 

   

the 2012 Plan, the Commission will annually update the report to help measure the success of its 

strategies and initiatives.     

Alongside the primary goal of expanding pro bono services, the Commission continues to 

address the needs of self-represented persons.  There is also continued need for the Commission 

to  focus  on  removal  of  barriers.      The  Commission  will  continue  assisting  self-represented 

persons by recommending more plain language forms to the Supreme Court, producing a series 

of educational videos with legal information and developing additional training for the bench and 

bar.  Most importantly, the Commission recognizes that it needs to do a better job of educating 

and  enhancing  public  awareness,  including  lawyers’  awareness,  about  the  resources  and 

opportunities available for self-represented persons and pro bono services.  

IV.    Goals 

A. 

Goal 1:  Fifty percent (50%) of attorneys residing in Tennessee will provide 

pro  bono  services  as  defined  by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  at  an  average  of  fifty  (50) 

hours per year on or before January 1, 2015.  

1. The Pro Bono Report (Appendix G).  In May 2011, ATJ Coordinator Anne-Louise 

Wirthlin  attended  the  Equal  Justice  Conference  presented  by  the  American  Bar  Association 

Standing Committee on Pro Bono and Public Service and the National Legal Aid and Defender 

Association.    A  common  theme  among  the  participants  was  that  there  was  no  comprehensive 

knowledge of the pro bono activities in each individual state.  ATJ groups are generally aware of 

pro bono efforts, but there is no centrally located information.  As a result, there are innovative 

and  effective  efforts  being  applied  across  the  country,  but,  without  centralized  data  and 

communications,  this  lack  of  knowledge  inhibits  planning  and  coordination.    The  Commission 

11 

   

asked the ATJ Coordinator to compile a comprehensive report on the pro bono services within 

the state of Tennessee.   

The Pro Bono Report thus provides baseline information to help the Commission better 

understand  the  conditions  affecting  access  to  justice  in  Tennessee  and  determine  whether  the 

Commission’s  strategies  and  efforts  are  successful.    The  Pro  Bono  Report  provides  a  highly 

detailed  and  invaluable  snapshot  of  the  current  state  of  pro  bono  in  Tennessee.    The  report 

addresses  the  Commission’s  activities  thus  far  and  provides  insight  into  areas  that  provide  the 

most  potential  for  successful  access  to  justice  initiatives  by  addressing  (1)  bar  association  pro 

bono;  (2)  law  school  pro  bono;  (3)  pro  bono  from  Legal  Aid  providers  (4)  attorney  pro  bono 

volunteer  reporting  statistics  (5)  2011  pro  bono  month,  (6)  statistical  summaries  of 

www.OnlineTNjustice.org, and (7) pro bono CLE hours.   

The  Supreme  Court  defines  “pro  bono  services”  as  services  provided  without  a  fee  or 

expectation of a fee to persons of limited means or organizations that primarily address the needs 

of persons of limited means.  Tenn. S. Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1 (a)(1)-(2).  Pro bono service can also be 

the delivery of legal services at a substantially reduced fee to persons of limited means.  Tenn. S. 

Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1 (b)(2).  Attorneys can also do pro bono through the provision of legal services 

at  no  fee  or  at  a  substantially  reduced  fee  to  individuals,  groups,  or  organizations  seeking  to 

secure  or  protect  civil  rights  and  liberties,  or  charitable,  religious,  civic,  community, 

governmental  and  educational  organizations  in  matters  in  furtherance  of  their  organizational 

purposes  where  payment  of  standard  legal  fees  would  deplete  the  organization’s  resources  or 

would  be  inappropriate.      Tenn.  S.  Ct.  R.  8,  RPC  6.1  (b)(1).    Participation  in  activities  for 

improving  the  law,  the  legal  system,  or  the  legal  profession  is  also  deemed  pro  bono  legal 

services by the Court.  Tenn. S. Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1 (b)(3).    

12 

   

The Pro Bono Report revealed that in 2009, 18.26% of attorneys licensed in Tennessee 

voluntarily  reported  pro  bono  service  with  their  Board  of  Professional  Responsibility  Annual 

Registration Packet.  That year, the average attorney reporting pro bono service donated seventy-

nine hours per  year.  For 2010,  38.96%  of all licensed attorneys voluntarily reported  pro bono 

service  averaging  seventy-three  hours  per  year.      The  2010  data  was  broken  down  further  to 

examine the reporting activity of attorneys residing in Tennessee and attorneys licensed but not 

residing  in  Tennessee.      The  data  revealed  that  6,598  of  the  estimated  16,391  attorneys  with 

active licenses residing in Tennessee reported their pro bono service.  Thus, in 2010, 40.25% of 

active  licensed  attorneys  residing  in  Tennessee  voluntarily  reported  pro  bono  service  at  an 

average of seventy-four hours per year, which exceeds the aspirational goal of 50 hours per year 

set forth in Tenn. S. Ct. R. 8, RPC 6.1.  With this information in hand, the Commission set the 

goal that 50% of attorneys residing in Tennessee will provide pro bono services as defined by the 

Court on an average of 50 hours per year on or before January 1, 2015.   

2.    Attorney Education.  Although legal advice clinics are an important aspect of pro 

bono, the Commission wants to emphasize the importance of a lawyer taking up representation 

of the individual, even if the representation is limited in scope.  Practitioners quickly learn that 

law school does not necessarily provide adequate preparation to immediately handle many of the 

areas  of  the  law  that  most  often  affect  indigent  Tennesseans.    These  areas  include  family  law, 

consumer/credit issues, landlord/tenant, and benefits.  It is vital and necessary to provide lawyers 

with the necessary skills to handle these “High Need” substantive areas of the law, particularly in 

specific  venues,  e.g.,  general  sessions,  juvenile,  family  law  and  bankruptcy  courts.    Moving 

forward, a particular emphasis of the Commission will be to focus on preparing pro bono lawyers 

to take on the direct representation of an individual, if an initial consultation does not resolve the 

13 

   

1.  Develop an online curriculum on High Need areas of the law, beginning with family 
law  and  debtor/creditor  issues  to  be  available  on  or  before  November  1,  2012. 
Complete  the  curriculum  by  August  1,  2013.    The  Commission  will  seek  to 
collaborate  with  the  Tennessee  Bar  Association  and  other  bar  associations,  legal 
service  providers,  the  Tennessee  Alliance  for  Legal  Services  and  the  groups  listed 
below to accomplish this goal.   

.        Law  Schools:  Assist  in  curriculum  development  and  use  the  curriculum  as 

template for symposia for law students. 

b.       The  Judiciary:  Use  judges  as  teachers  and  instructors  for  the  courses  to 

increase participation and demonstrate judicial support. 

c.        Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts:  Develop  webcast(s)  on  pro  bono 
opportunities  available  to  lawyers  and  promote  www.JusticeForAll.com  as  a 
method  to  disseminate  information  to  lawyers.    Ask  the  Court  and  other 
judges to participate in the webcasts. 

  a

 

2.  Establish a marketing and public relations campaign to communicate strategies and 

CLE opportunities to lawyers to launch on or before October 1, 2012. 

a.        Inform  lawyers  that  they  may  obtain  Ethics  and  Professionalism  CLE  credit 

for their pro bono work. 

b.       Promote  the  access  to  justice  website,  www.JusticeForAllTN.com,  as  a 
method  for  lawyers  to  find  out  what  pro  bono  opportunities  and  resources 
exist inside and outside their area.   
 

3.  Promote to other cities the partnership model established by Nashville law firms, the 
“Pillar Firm” model, whereby firms with strong commitments educate their attorneys 
on substantive areas of the law and take more pro bono cases in those areas. 
 

4.  By October 1, 2012, propose to the Court/CLE Commission that excess CLE funds 
be    designated  by  the  CLE  Commission  and  the  Supreme  Court  to  provide  for  the 
High  Needs  pro  bono  CLE  training,  the  promotion  thereof,  and  other  access  to 
justice initiatives.  

5.  Measure and track the results of this initiative by tracking attendance and following 
up  with  attorneys  who  participated  in  the  curriculum  to  determine  if  they 
subsequently took a pro bono case.  

legal  issue.  Direct  representation  can  entail  handling  the  entire  case  or  providing  “unbundled” 

legal services per an agreement with the individual.   

The Commission will: 

14 

 

 

     

   

o  increase  participation  so  that  50%  of  lawyers  residing  in  Tennessee  provide  an 

3.  Attorney Recruitment 

  T

average  of  50  hours  of  pro  bono  per  year,  the  Commission  must  add  to  the  existing  pool  of 

attorneys engaged in pro bono.  Multiple initiatives should be utilized to recruit more lawyers.  

The  Commission  understands  that  there  is  a  wide  spectrum  of  law  practices  in  Tennessee, 

ranging from solo practitioners to large law firms, and that lawyers practice in urban, suburban, 

and rural communities and that not every strategy is appropriate for every community.  

To recruit more lawyers providing pro bono, the Commission will: 

1.  Promote  www.JusticeForAllTN.com  and  www.onlineTNjustice.org  to  increase 

awareness of alternative ways to participate. 

2.  By December 1, 2012, provide attorneys in parts of the state with no organized pro 
bono program with resources such as Attorney of the Day materials to organize pro 
bono efforts tailored to their community. 

3. 

Identify firms that do not have pro bono policies and request that those firms adopt a 
pro bono policy so that 10 additional firms adopt pro bono plans by January 1, 2013,

4.  Client Education and Removal of Barriers 

      Providing  Tennesseans  with  an  understanding  of  how  to  access  a  lawyer  is  integral  to 

delivering access to justice. This requires a  public awareness effort to reach Tennesseans in need 

through partnerships with places the public commonly goes to seek help, such as libraries, faith-

based organizations, courthouses and social service providers.  In conjunction with educating the 

public,  the  Commission  will  continue  its  work  to  remove  common  barriers  encountered  in  the 

search  for  a  pro  bono  lawyer.    Many  of  these  objectives  compliment  the  Commission’s  goals 

regarding public awareness for self-represented persons discussed in more detail in Section B.   

To educate the public on the availability of pro bono services and to remove barriers to 

finding a pro bono lawyer, the Commission will: 

1.  Promote  the  available  existing  technology  such  as  Online  Tennessee  Justice, 
Tennessee Technology Centers, www.JusticeForAllTN.com as ways to access a pro 
bono lawyer. 

2.  Provide  information  and  resources  to  intake  staff  at  legal  service  organizations 
through  TALS,  general  sessions  courts,  and  court  clerks  offices  so  that  they  can 
direct the public to pro bono lawyers.   The AOC will supply information to judicial 
staff and to state and federal elected officials. 

3.  Explore the creation of an Access to Justice application for smart phones and tablet 
computers  to  provide  clients  with  easily  accessible  information  on  pro  bono 
resources in their community.  Make a recommendation to the Court by November 1, 
2012.   

4.  Make  www.JusticeForAllTN.com  available  in  languages  other  than  English, 

beginning with Spanish by September 1, 2012 

5.  By  September  1, 2012, develop guidance and instructions on the use of interactive 
technology such as Skype to connect clients in rural areas with pro bono lawyers in 
other parts of the state.

Connecting Lawyers With Clients 

  5. 
 

Once  more  lawyers  are educated and recruited to take  pro bono cases and the public is 

more  aware  of  the  existing  and  new  resources  available,  the  Commission’s  focus  can  shift  to 

connecting the lawyers with the clients.  The Commission has identified two primary ways that 

clients are currently connected with pro bono lawyers.  One way is through legal aid providers 

federally funded by the Legal Services Corporation (“LSC providers”) and the second is through 

non-LSC  providers.    A  non-LSC  provider  describes  any  organization  that  provides  pro  bono 

legal help but that does not receive federal funding from the Legal Services Corporation.  The 

term includes state and locally funded legal service providers, bar associations, and faith-based 

organizations that provide legal advice and assistance.  A comprehensive pro bono infrastructure 

must include both LSC providers and non-LSC providers. 

Currently, the only widespread pro bono system available to the public consists of the pro 

bono programs of the four regional LSC programs.  Together, their territory covers every county 

in the state.  Federal law requires that at least 12.5% of the federal LSC funding be allocated by 

the  LSC  organization  toward  private  attorney  involvement  or  pro  bono  lawyers.  Even  though 

Tennessee’s LSC programs allocate more than the required amount toward providing pro bono 

services,  they  remain  unable  to  provide  pro  bono  services  in  every  county,  and  Congress 

continues to reduce federal funding.  

Because  of  their  statewide  presence,  LSC  programs  are  presently  the  organizations  to 

which individuals are typically referred for pro bono assistance.  Judges refer litigants to them.  

Notices from the state regarding help with appeal rights for denial of public assistance refer to 

the  LSC  providers.    Lawyers  like  to  be  affiliated  with  them  because  of  their  reputation,  CLE 

opportunities,  screening,  malpractice 

insurance,  and  established  system  for  referrals. 

17 

   

Additionally,  LSC  organizations  have  existing,  solid  partnerships  with  non-LSC  providers  and 

the access to justice community.  Even though LSC providers are unable to take certain types of 

cases  due  to  federal  restrictions,  they  are  not  restricted  from  referring  those  cases  to  other 

attorneys to meet client needs.  

Many non-LSC organizations provide services to a select population or a specific locality 

and  serve  client  populations  that  LSC  providers  cannot  serve.  The  Commission  hopes  to 

encourage other institutions to provide pro bono services.  One such example is the plan adopted 

by  the  Tennessee  and  Memphis  Conferences  of  the  United  Methodist  Church  which  uses  the 

Church’s  existing  infrastructure  and  commitment  to  social  justice  to  partner  with  the 

Commission  to  recruit  member  lawyers  to  provide  pro  bono  services.    (Appendix  J).    The 

Commission has devoted much time and resources to the development of projects such as the Pro 

Bono Summit, Pro Bono Clinic in a Box and endorsed the creation of OnlineTNJustice (which 

serves clients across the state) to create more pro bono opportunities.   

The Commission hopes to serve as a coordinating arm for LSC and non-LSC pro bono 

providers to increase pro bono opportunities, serve in a coordinating and sponsoring role for pro 

bono  activities,  resources  and  statistics  and  develop  innovative  ideas  to  provide  clients  greater 

access  to  justice.    To  accomplish  this  goal  across  the  state,  the  Commission  will  seek  input, 

support  and  feedback  from  pro  bono  service  providers,  the  judiciary,  the  private  bar,  the 

executive  branch,  social  service  providers,  faith-based  institutions,  public  libraries  and  other 

organizations which serve Tennesseans with civil legal needs.  

     To  connect  lawyers  with  clients  through  LSC  and  non-LSC  providers,  the 

Commission  will  provide  a  foundation  for  a  comprehensive  system  of  delivery  of  pro  bono 

services across the state beginning with the following steps: 

18 

   

 

1.  Coordinate regular meetings with the Executive Directors and Pro Bono Directors of 
each of the four LSC providers and with non-LSC providers, the TBA, and TALS to 
determine  the  framework  for  a  comprehensive  approach  to  connect  clients  to 
available resources. 

2.  By  November  1,  2012,  develop  resources  for  intake  staff  to  assist  them  to  make 
referrals  and  foster  accountability  when  their  respective  agency  cannot  provide  the 
client with legal help.  

3.  Explore  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  statewide  toll  free  information  phone  line 
which  lawyers  staff,  and  the  public  can  access  to  get  information  on  available 
resources throughout the state. 

B.  Goal  2:  The  Commission  Will  Continue  Its  Efforts  to  Assist  Self-Represented 
Persons. 

Although  the  Commission  will  focus  primarily  upon  expanding  pro  bono  services  to 

indigent  Tennesseans,  it  is  inevitable  that  some  Tennesseans  will  not  have  access  to  pro  bono 

help.    This  means  that  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  the  public  to  better  understand  the  legal 

system.    This  need  has  been  particularly  noticed  by  judges,  who  indicated  in  response  to  the 

Commission’s survey that this is an area of special significance and that educational videos could 

help address this need.  (Appendix M—Judges Survey).   

The  Commission  has  made  significant  strides  in  making  the  court-system  more  user-

friendly  and  removing  barriers  for  self-represented  persons.    Court-approved  plain  language 

forms  ensure  that  self-represented  persons  have  acceptable  pleadings.    “Attorney  of  the  Day” 

programs place lawyers in courtrooms to serve as informational sources and to provide limited 

representation to otherwise self-represented persons.   However, there is much more work to do. 

To assist self-represented individuals, the Commission will: 

1.  By  November  1,  2012  produce  a  series  of  educational  videos  for  self-represented 
parties  on  specific  types  of  legal  issues  beginning  with  family  law  and 
debtor/creditor  issues,  general  topics  such  as  “How  to  Prepare  for  Court.”  By 
November 1, 2012, provide instructions on how to complete plain language forms. 
 

19 

 

 

 

 

   

2.  By  April  1,  2013,  develop  and  recommend  additional  plain  language  forms, 
including  expanding  the  divorce  forms  to  include  forms  for  uncontested  divorces 
with minor children.  By October 1, 2013, develop and recommend plain language 
forms regarding child support guidelines.   

3.  Foster  collaboration  with  the  Tennessee  Board  of  Regents  to  use  Technology 
Centers  as  a  centralized  self-help  entity  with  the  goal  of  establishing  one  self-help 
center in each Grand Division by January 1, 2013. 

4.  By  April  1,  2013,  examine  and  make  recommendations  for  systemic  change  in the 
general sessions courts, specifically looking at how attorneys can be more involved 
in  helping  otherwise  self-represented  individuals  through  Attorney  of  the  Day 
programs and limited scope representation 

5.  Create a policy clearly distinguishing between legal information and legal advice to 
provide guidance to court staff, clerks and attorneys assisting in self-help centers on 
or before September 1, 2012. 

6.  By March 1, 2013, expand the General Sessions Court Pro Se Bench Book project 
into  universally  acceptable  instructions  for  all  judges  in  cases  involving  self-
represented parties. 

7.  Develop  sample  plain  language  signage  for  the  courthouse  with  the  assistance  of 
court  staff  to  be  distributed  by  the  AOC  to  court  staff  on  or  before  September  1, 
2012. 

C. Goal 3:  The Commission will continue to develop additional strategies to eliminate 

access to justice barriers.  

Some  of  the  strategies  outlined  above  address  barriers  that  Tennesseans  face  including 

geography,  language,  and  literacy  and  disability.    In  order  to  further  address  disability  and 

language barriers, the Commission will:  

1.  By  December  1,  2012,  offer  Commissioner  and  Committee  member  expertise, 
including  technological  expertise,  to  assist  the  Administrative  Office  of  the  Courts 
with remote interpreting pilot projects, its efforts to encourage agencies to ensure the 
court is aware of the need for interpreters before court hearings, and educate judges, 
clerks,  public  defenders  and  attorneys  general  of  Supreme  Court  Rule  42 
requirement to use credentialed interpreters before non-credentialed interpreters.  

2.  By  December  1,  2012,  offer  assistance  to  agencies  which  provide  services  to 
immigrants  to  provide  education  to  immigrants  on  issues  such  as  U  Visas, 
unaccompanied  immigrant  youth  and  children  in  the  juvenile  courts,  immigrants 

20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

  

accused  of  crimes,  asylum,  eligibility  for  state  benefits,  and  immigrant  issues  in 
family court.  

When  developing  the  2012  Plan,  the  Commission  set  out  to  solidify  Tennessee  as  a 

national leader in the availability of pro bono legal services, in the elimination of barriers to the 

justice  system,  and  in  assisting  the  public  to  understand  and  successfully  engage  the  justice 

system.    To  the  best  of  the  Commission’s  knowledge,  Tennessee  is  the  only  state  that  has 

committed  to  comprehensively  track  the  manner  and  method  in  which  pro  bono  services  are 

provided  to  the  public  and  to  use  that  data  to  provide  accountability  for  the  Access  to  Justice 

programs.  The full support of the Supreme Court and existing collaboration among Tennessee’s 

lawyers  and  its  access  to  justice  community  has  inspired  the  Commission’s  grand,  but 

achievable,  goal  of  increasing  pro  bono  participation  so  that  50%  of  attorneys  residing  in 

Tennessee perform an average of 50 hours of pro bono service as defined by the Supreme Court 

per year.     

The existing network of lawyers, law firms, corporate legal departments, bar associations, 

legal  service  programs,  judges,  clerks,  law  schools,  librarians,  service  providers,  nonprofits, 

faith-based organizations, and businesses will grow as more lawyers are educated,  recruited and 

given  the  skills  to  help  indigent  Tennesseans  with  civil  legal  matters.  Toward  that  end,  the 

Commission will focus on promoting existing resources, growing new resources and technology, 

and  cultivating  partnerships  to  connect  lawyers  with  clients  to  close  the  civil  legal  needs  gap 

while simultaneously advancing projects that eliminate barriers and make the court system more 

user-friendly  for  self-represented  persons.    The  Commission  remains  committed  to  effecting 

systemic change to address the unmet legal needs of the state, for Tennesseans deserve no less

FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE SEEKS TO ALIGN PRO BONO ATTORNEYS 
 WITH THEIR WORSHIP COMMUNITIES 

 

  F

   

    N

ashville, Tenn. – In an effort to reach more people in need of information about legal 
services,  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court’s  Access  to  Justice  Commission  has  formed  a 
faith-based initiative to engage lawyers within their place of worship. 

The Tennessee Faith and Justice Alliance (TFJA) is a program developed by the Access 
to Justice Commission to support and encourage faith-based groups in Tennessee who 
commit to providing legal resources to their congregations and communities.  

It’s one of the first programs of its kind in the country created to align needs seen at the 
local church level with possible legal resources that are nearby, perhaps even within the 
same congregation.  The notion is to connect with people in need in a place they already 
go to seek help with a problem. That place is quite often their place of worship. 

 “Faith communities are a natural fit with our efforts to help those in need find access to 
legal advice,” said Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia A. Clark. “And with our 
goal of helping more lawyers find more occasions to provide pro bono services, this is 
the  ideal  opportunity  for  attorneys  to  put  faith  in  action  in  their  own  worship 
communities.” 

The pilot project for the initiative kicked off last month with members of the Tennessee 
Conference  of  the  United  Methodist  Church.  Church  leaders  and  volunteer  attorneys 
gathered  to  learn  more  about  the  program,  assign  attorneys  to  congregations,  and 
receive training on how the program works.  

The program is flexible to meet the needs and resources of a particular community. The 
United Methodist Church’s TFJA project is designed to pair an attorney with a place of 
worship.  When  a  leader  or  clergy  member  of  that  congregation  learns  of  a  member’s 
legal  need,  that  leader  can  then  refer  the  person  to  the  local  attorney  who  has 
volunteered  to  serve  as  a  resource  to  that  congregation.  That  attorney  in  turn  will 
provide  the  legal  advice  needed,  or  make  connections  with  other  resources  that  can 
provide the necessary services.  

Twenty-four  attorneys  associated  with  UMC  churches  have  already  committed  their 
service  to  the  program  for  their  church  or  another  UMC  church  in  the  Nashville  area 
that does not have an attorney in the congregation.  Fourteen churches have at least one 
attorney aligned with their congregation.  

The TFJA program, which has plans to expand to all faiths and geographic areas of the 
state,  is  flexible  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  particular  community.  The  UMC  model  is  just 
one  way  to  offer  services.  Other  organizations  may  consider  monthly  legal  clinics  or 
other offerings. 

The TJFA is a project of the Access to Justice Commission and was formed in 2012.  The 
Access to Justice Commission is tasked with making recommendations to the Supreme 
Court of projects and programs necessary for enhancing access to justice. 

For more information, or if you are interested in developing a similar program in your 
faith-community, contact Palmer Williams, Pro Bono Coordinator at the Administrative 
Office of the Courts, palmer.williams@tncourts.gov or 615-741-2687 ext. 1414. 

   

Tennessee Access to Justice Initiative with 
The Tennessee and Memphis Conferences of the United Methodist Church 

.  The Problem 

More  than  35  million  Americans  live  below  the  poverty  level,  and  another  10  million 
have  incomes  that  are  less  than  25%  higher  than  that  level.    At  least  40%  of  these  Americans 
have a legal problem of some kind each year. 70% of low-income Tennesseans experience some 
type of legal problem each year.  Approximately one million Tennesseans need legal counsel and 
cannot  afford  it.    But  with  only  75  or  so  Legal  Aid  attorneys,  most  of  those  low  income 
individuals have limited or no access to legal counsel. They feel shut out from the legal system.  
They do not turn to the system for solutions because they believe the system will not help them.   

I.  Tennessee Access to Justice Commission 

The  Access  to  Justice  Commission  was  created  by  the  Supreme  Court  to  develop  a 
strategic plan for improving access to justice in Tennessee that includes education of the public, 
identification of priorities to meet the need of improved access to justice, and recommendations 
to the Supreme Court of projects and programs the Commission determines to be necessary and 
appropriate for enhancing access to justice in Tennessee.  The first strategic plan was unveiled in 
2010,  and  the  Commission  will  present  its  second  strategic  plan  in  the  spring  of  2012.    One 
aspect  of  the  strategic  plan  is  to incorporate  the  faith-based  communities  into  the  initiatives  of 
the Access to Justice Commission. 

II.   Initiative with the Tennessee Conference of the United Methodist Church presented at 
the Cabinet Meeting on January 12, 2012. 
     

Chief  Justice  Cornelia  Clark  and  Tennessee  Access  to  Justice  Commission  (“ATJ 
Commission”)  Chair  Margaret  Behm  met  with  the  Tennessee  Conference  of  the  United 
Methodist Church (“TNUMC”) Cabinet to present the following initiative on January 12, 2012.   
The  Commission  requested  the  Cabinet  consider  a  program  which  utilizes  TNUMC’s  present 
social  justice  programs  and  church  initiatives  and  incorporate  pro  bono  lawyers  into  those 
programs (the “Initiative”).   The following suggestions for the Initiative were presented:  

1.      Churches  will  be  encouraged  to  recruit  and  designate  lawyers  within  their 
congregation to assist when a pro legal need arises.   This lawyer would either take the case or 
take the responsibility to refer the person to the appropriate resource.  Training will be provided 
to  local  church  staff  about  legal  problem  spotting  so  staff  can  make  appropriate  referrals  to 
lawyers.  

2.    There are many pro bono initiatives throughout the state, and the lawyers affiliated 
with  these  programs  could  be  available  for  social  justice  initiatives  of  UMC.    Additionally, 
lawyers in local congregations can be encouraged to be legal resources for UMC’s social justice 
initiatives.    For  example,  lawyers  have  been  recruited  and  trained  to  assist  people  who  have 
suffered losses due to natural disasters.  UMC lawyers might be encouraged to participate in this 
training  and  be  available  through  established  pro  bono  initiatives  to  work  with  TNUMC’s

Disaster  Response  and  Recovery  Program,  with  the  Flood  Recovery  Network,  or  with  broader 
UMCOR initiatives. 

3.    Churches would provide space in their building for legal clinics, either on a regular 
basis  or  for  a  particular  purpose.    Currently,  several  UMC  churches  host  legal  clinics,  and  the 
Commission and TNUMC would work to increase that number.  Additionally, churches would 
be  encouraged  to  set  up  their  own  initiatives,  such  as  Justice  for  Our  Neighbors  (JFON),  with 
assistance from the Commission. 

4.      Churches  will  receive  information  as  to  how  to  assist  persons  in  gaining  access  to 
information for legal assistance through resources such as the Access to Justice website or local 
pro bono programs. 

5.    TNUMC will designate a person as the primary contact to work on this initiative. 
 

 
After  the  presentation,  the  Cabinet  unanimously  affirmed  this  Initiative  with  the  Tennessee 
Access  to  Justice  Commission  through  the  cooperative  aid  of  attorneys  and  congregations.  
Nashville  District  Superintendent  and  Cabinet  Secretary,  John  Collett,  was  designated  to  work 
with the Commission on the Initiative. 
 

On January 25, 2012, District Superintendent John Collett and Jason Brock, Director of 
Church  Vitality  and  Justice,  met  with  Lucinda  Smith,  Director  of  the  Nashville  Pro  Bono 
Program (“Pro Bono Program”) and Margaret Behm.  The Pro Bono Program is affiliated with

In District Lawyer Network 
 
I.   Role of District Superintendent 

s  part  of  the  Initiative,  the  District  Superintendent  is  asked  to  announce  and  promote  the 

Initiative in his or her district as follows: 
 

1.  Request each pastor to ask an attorney or attorneys in their congregation to serve as a 
resource  in  the  event  a  pastor  needs  to  refer  someone  for  legal  advice.    Ask  the 
attorney  to  assume  responsibility  for  finding  a  lawyer  in  the  event  the  lawyer  is 
unable  to  help.      Pastor  provides  name  of  congregation  lawyer  to  the  district 
superintendent.  

2.  Find at least one attorney, preferable two to three attorneys in each District, who will 
service as leaders and coordinators for lawyers to be available to assist congregations

Identify Legal Need and Connect Individuals With Legal Help 

ndividuals with legal problems often do not have access to legal help.  Indeed, individuals may 
not understand that there are legal solutions to the problems they face. If ministers and church 
staff learn to spot legal problems that affect the life of their congregant, referral to a lawyer may 
have a positive impact on the congregant’s personal crisis.  

he help that a lawyer can provide in a life crisis may not be immediately obvious. To start to 
understand how legal  help might  impact the day-to-day  life of individuals in a  church, we can 
look at some common legal problems. 

he Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands and the Nashville Pro Bono 
Program provide free legal help to low income individuals in 48 counties of middle Tennessee. 
The  resources  of  LAS  and  the  Program  are  limited,  and  they  can  not  help  every  person  with 
every case, so a review of the kinds of cases for which they provide help is not definitive of what 
help people need.  However, it is instructive to review the top ten case categories for which help 
was provided in 2011: 

op 10 Case Types 

ivorce/Domestic Abuse 

Collection/Bankruptcy 
Social Security Income 
Medicaid/TennCare  
Private Landlord Tenant  
Wills/Estates/Powers of Attorney 
Federally Subsidized/Public Housing 
Unemployment Compensation 
Taxes 
Contracts/warranties 

f  we  consider  the  nature  of  the  personal  problems  that  are  reflected  in  these  “Top  10” 
categories, it suggests how spotting legal issues and referral to a lawyer may help individuals in 
crisis.    These  general  personal  problem  categories  would  include  family  conflict  (Divorce/ 
Domestic Abuse/Custody/Visitation); loss of income (SSI/Medicaid/TennCare/Unemployment); 
and problems with Housing (Private Landlord Tenant/Federally subsidized/Public housing). 

he success of this initiative depends on the ability of the church staff to identify the need for a 
lawyer  and  make  referrals  to  lawyers.    Staff  would  be  trained  to  spot  legal  problems  and 
solutions in the lives of congregants.   

Some examples of these issues: 

A woman whose husband is suffering from dementia, with moments of lucidity but refusing 
to pay utility bills and mortgage, is concerned that she will lose her home and the husband 
may need more help than she can provide.

 Potential legal issues for which a lawyer can give advice/counsel and help: 

Control of finances through a Power  of Attorney  if  the  husband is  competent to  work  with the 
lawyer  and  willing to  do  so  or  possibly  a  conservatorship if  he  is  not;  Assessment  of  need  for 
trust if the family will need nursing home benefits. 

A  father  who  has  lost  employment  is  despondent  over  providing  for  his  family  and 
harassing calls from creditors. 

 

Potential legal issues for which a lawyer can give advice/counsel and help: 

Debt  issues  may  be  addressed  with  advice  about  dealing  with  harassing  creditors,  protecting 
income  and  property  if  sued  and  the  timeline  for  any  creditor  taking  legal  action  to  collect  a 
debt, plus the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection as necessary. 

Income can be secured through application for unemployment benefits and representation at a 
hearing for these benefits if denied. 

Housing issues may need to be addressed through representation in negotiating with a landlord 
or mortgage holder.  

Woman who feels threatened by her child’s father who is her primary source of support 

Potential legal issues for which a lawyer can give advice/counsel and help: 

Safety of woman and child may be secured through Order of Protection which may give her right 
to possession of property, legal custody and support for her child. 

If Order of Protection is not appropriate, woman may need assistance understanding her rights 
to maintain a residence owned/rented by her or the other party or both, her rights to personal 
property,  and  her  custody  rights,  with  legal  help  to  obtain  a  court  order  for  custody  as 
necessary. 

Income  issues  include  right  to  support  for  child  secured  through  Juvenile  Court  if  Order  of 
Protection is not required.

Legal Needs Study 
Description 

 

Legal Needs Assessment of Low-Income Tennesseans 
Project Proposal 

he University of Tennessee College of Social Work Office of Research and Public Service (UT SWORPS) 
proposes to conduct a statewide needs assessment to identify the civil legal needs of low-income 
Tennesseans. Replicating a study conducted by UT SWORPS in 2003, purposes of this statewide legal 
needs assessment include:  

• 

Identification of current met and unmet civil legal needs among Tennessee’s low-income 
population  

•  Generating information that can be used in tailoring resources to more effectively meet the 

identified needs of the targeted population 

In addition to that earlier scope, the present study will also provide: 

•  A comparison of identified current met and unmet civil legal needs to findings reported in the 

•  An assessment of the extent to which the legal needs of those citizens served by the current 

2003 study 

system are met (pilot) 

ethods 

  M

This study proposes to employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to address the above stated 
purposes. A statewide telephone survey with low income residents will be employed to collect data on 
current perceptions of met and unmet civil legal needs.  Focus groups with low-income residents who 
have received assistance with legal services will be utilized to collect data related to the quality of those 
experiences. 

elephone Survey 
A 15-minute survey will be administered by telephone by the Center for Applied Research and 
Evaluation (CARE), a survey research center within UT SWORPS.  
Sample: The goal will be to complete 800 surveys with low income residents representing different 
geographic areas of the state. A stratified statewide random sampling approach will be utilized, 
providing a 95 percent level of confidence with a +/-3.5 margin of error, allowing conclusions to be 
drawn about the state as a whole. Due to current trends of steady decreases in the number of 
households with telephone landlines and the increase in the use of cellular telephones, we propose to 
use a targeted landline sample for zip codes in areas with high concentration of poverty supplemented 
with a sample of cellular telephones.  

urvey Instrument: The survey instrument used in 2003 will be revised yet, retain enough of the content 
to allow for comparisons between reported citizens’ perceptions in 2003 and the present time.  The 
survey instrument utilized in the original study comprised of 80 closed-ended items that referenced the 
participating households’ civil legal problems during the 12 months preceding the interview. For each of 
the 800 surveys, the CARE interviewer will ask to speak with the person in the household who “knows 
the most about [the] household’s legal experiences in the past year.” This request is designed to yield

survey responses primarily from heads of household regardless of age or gender and also to solicit richer 
information from those who are most knowledgeable on the topic. To ensure Spanish speaking residents 
of Tennessee are included in the population surveyed, UT SWORPS will contract with a Spanish 
translator who will convert the English language survey instrument into Spanish. CARE will employ a 
bilingual interviewer to call back and interview households identified as Spanish-speaking. 

nalysis: The data analyses employed in this study will primarily include descriptive statistics (i.e., 
frequencies, means, medians, ranges, etc.) Percentages will be based on the number of responses to 
each survey item, thus omitting missing data. In addition, cross-tabulations will be conducted and 
correlation coefficients determined for selected variables. These variables will include level of poverty 
(Low Income or Extremely Low Income), language of survey administration (English or Spanish), age of 
respondent, number of household members, number of problem areas per household, and types of 
problem categories per household. Chi-square tests of significance will be conducted to determine 
statistical differences among the selected variables. Results from the 2003 survey will be compared to 
2013 study to assess change over time.  

ocus Groups 
To explore the extent to which low income residents who have recently utilized legal services perceive 
that their needs were met, we propose to conduct a pilot study using a focus group methodology to 
gather pertinent information.  

ogistics: Four (4) focus group sessions will be facilitated by two UT SWORPS staff members. From a list 
provided, UT SWORPS will recruit 8 to 10 participants for each focus group using a $50.00 gift card as an 
incentive. One staff member will facilitate the group while the other will serve as a note-taker. Each 
session should last approximately 45 to 60 minutes. Each session will be digitally recorded and these 
recordings will be available for reference in case clarification is needed on a particular statement or to 
assure accuracy of quotes used in the reports. Two of these focus groups will be held in rural East 
Tennessee and two will be held in Knoxville. Results from this pilot will inform a larger, statewide study.  

acilitation Guide: UT SWORPS staff will work collaboratively with stakeholders identified to design 
questions to facilitate discussions about satisfaction with legal services.  The following general 
categories of service attributes that have been identified as relevant to measuring customer satisfaction 
in public and non-profit agencies may be utilized as a starting point:  

Global Satisfaction –general sense of satisfaction with services received, satisfaction with lawyer 
Kind/Type of Service –relevance of services provided in relation to the needs of the customer 
Procedures –promptness and ease of access experienced 
Courtesy –politeness and respect experienced in interactions with lawyer and support staff 
Outcome of Service –impact that services had on customer problem 
 

Analysis: Using the strategies proposed by Krueger (2000) and the five-phased cycle proposed by Yin 
(2011) as a framework for the qualitative analysis, UT SWORPS staff will compile all the qualitative data 
by first reviewing the summary documents and organizing the data into a manageable structure, most

likely by audience (urban versus rural) and by focus group question. Following Yin’s second phase of

begin the coding process. The researchers will then look for emerging patterns. In the two final phases 
of the analysis, the UT team will interpret the qualitative data and draw conclusions.

RGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE 

he College of Social Work Office of Research and Public Service (UT SWORPS) is a unit of the University 
of Tennessee’s College of Social Work. Our mission is to improve the quality of human service practice in 
the state, the Southeast, and in the nation. As part of a land grant university, we hold a unique 
responsibility to provide services that support public welfare. This objective guides the efforts of this 
organization. UT SWORPS seeks to establish a cooperative relationship with Tennessee’s state 
organizations and local social service agencies to expand opportunities for more effective public 
services.  

or over 30 years, UT SWORPS has responded to requests from state and local organizations for 
research services, staff development, and technical assistance. Through partnerships with these 
organizations, UT SWORPS has developed the capability and capacity to provide state and local agencies 
with on-demand access to resources and programs. These alliances support the maximum utilization of 
available federal and state funding even in a period of overall reduction in government resources.   
UT SWORPS research experience ranges from simple consultations about research design to complete 
responsibility for implementation of a research study, including conceptualizing the research design and 
evaluation plan, employing research and evaluation activities, collecting and analyzing data, and 
reporting results. UT SWORPS research staff has expertise with research design, research methodology, 
needs assessment, program evaluation, test validation, data analysis, information management, and 
database development.  

ESEARCH AND EVALUATION  

aryanne Cunningham is Associate Director for the Research, Evaluation, and Systems Engineering Unit 

at UT SWORPS. She leads a staff of professionals with expertise in the areas of statistics, quantitative 
research, qualitative research, testing and assessment development, survey development, software 
development, systems engineering, and human service research. 

WORPS can offer quality research, evaluation, and needs assessment services designed to meet the 
needs of organizations and conform to funding mandates. SWORPS researchers and evaluators adhere 
to the ethics and guiding principles widely accepted by professionals across the nation. SWORPS 
produces reports that meet the needs of the agencies and organizations it serves whether they are 
formal written reports, PowerPoint presentations of major findings, informal reports of results, or 
statistical summaries.  

taff statisticians and evaluators employ standard statistical analysis techniques for analyzing 
quantitative data and use widely accepted techniques for analyzing qualitative data. The difference 
between qualitative and quantitative studies is one that is often discussed in research organizations. It is 
important to know how many people a program served and how many improved their lives or made

some change that can be attributed to a program or service. Quantitative research allows us to do that. 
Yet, at times, we need to know more. Qualitative research provides valuable, insightful information 
about a research topic or a program – information that cannot be gleaned from quantitative data alone. 
Through qualitative research methods such as interviews, focus groups, and observations, evaluators 
can explore the why and how questions of a research design. Using a multi-method approach where 
quantitative and qualitative methods are combined makes a study stronger and richer in detail. A 
researcher then has “hard data” to share facts and figures about program implementation and 
effectiveness but can also provide descriptive information that brings a study to life. These may be 
stories from those affected by an issue or program, quotes from an interview that illuminate a particular 
issue, or detailed explanations provided by key informants to give greater understanding.  
UT SWORPS evaluators have been professionally trained by Richard Krueger, Ph.D., University of 
Minnesota, an internationally known and well published expert in focus group research.  

he Center for Applied Research and Evaluation (CARE), a unit within the UT SWORPS Research, 
Evaluation, and Systems Engineering Unit, houses a 22 station phone bank.  The phone bank utilizes 
Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology.   This advanced technology allows for 
sample tracking to ensure the highest possible response rates.  CARE employs experienced telephone 
interviewers who are well trained in proper survey methodology and interviewing techniques. 
Linda Daugherty directs CARE and has over 20 years of experience conducting survey research.  She is 
ABD in Political Science at the University of Tennessee with a concentration in Public Policy and Program 
Evaluation.  She has an in-depth understanding of data-collection methodologies and is particularly 
knowledgeable about valid and reliable methods for reaching hard to reach populations.
