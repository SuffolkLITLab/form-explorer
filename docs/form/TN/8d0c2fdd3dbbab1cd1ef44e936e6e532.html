      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT KNOXVILLE
Assigned on Briefs October 3, 2022

STEPHEN FARBER ET AL. v. NUCSAFE, INC. ET AL.

Appeal from the Chancery Court for Anderson County
No. 21CH3012       M. Nichole Cantrell, Chancellor

No. E2022-00428-COA-R3-CV

This  is  a  breach  of  contract  action  between  a  lender,  borrower,  and  guarantor  on  a 
promissory  note.  When  the  borrower  ceased  payment  on  the  promissory  note and  the 
borrower and guarantor failed to cure the default, the lender commenced this action against 
the borrower and the guarantor. After extensive discovery, the lender passed away, and the 
personal representatives of the lender’s estate were substituted as the party plaintiffs. The 
estate filed a motion for summary judgment based on two grounds. The first ground was 
that in their discovery responses, the defendants admitted that they failed to remit payments 
as required by the promissory note. Second, the defendants’ discovery responses denied 
that  the  defendants had any  facts  or  evidence  upon  which  to  support  the  affirmative 
defenses that the lender violated the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing and/or that the 
note  was  unenforceable.  The  defendants filed  a  response  in  opposition  to  the summary 
judgment motion, supported by the affidavit of the president of both defendants. Relying 
on the affidavit, the defendants asserted, for the first time, that neither defendant was ever 
liable for the debt because the lender had never remitted the loan proceeds to the borrower.
The trial court ruled that the bulk of the affidavit was inadmissible on three grounds. First,
it found  the  officer’s  testimony regarding  conversations  with  the  deceased  lender 
inadmissible  under  the  Dead  Man’s  Statute, Tennessee  Code  Annotated  §  24-1-203. 
Second,  it  found  certain statements  were  directly  contradictory  to previous  discovery 
responses,  so the  court  accordingly  rejected  the  evidence  under  the  Cancellation  Rule.
Third,  it  found  the  business  records  the  affiant  referenced in  his  affidavit  but  did  not 
produce  failed  to  satisfy  the  best  evidence  rule.  After  considering the  statement  of 
undisputed  facts, discovery  responses, and  the  defendants’  admissions, the  trial  court
concluded  that  the  material  facts  were  undisputed  and  that  the  estate  was  entitled  to 
judgment  as  a  matter  of  law.  Accordingly,  it  granted  the  estate’s  motion and  awarded a 
judgment for the outstanding principal and interest totaling $260,710.00 and $12,445.28 in 
attorneys’ fees and expenses. The defendants appealed. We affirm.

Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Chancery Court Affirmed

03/15/2023FRANK G. CLEMENT, JR., P.J., M.S., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which CARMA 
DENNIS MCGEE and KRISTI M. DAVIS, JJ., joined.

Mark E. Brown, Knoxville, Tennessee, for the appellants, Nucsafe, Inc. and Breton Equity 
Company Corp.

J.  Chadwick  Hatmaker,  C.  Gavin  Shepherd,  Knoxville,  Tennessee,  for  the  appellees,
Stephen  Farber  and  John  Maisel,  as  Personal  Representatives  for  the  Estate  of  Richard 
Seymour.

OPINION

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

In  October  2015,  Nucsafe,  Inc.  (“Nucsafe”)  and  Breton  Equity  Company Corp.
(“Breton Equity”)  (collectively  “Defendants”)  executed  a  Modified  and  Amended 
Promissory  Note (“the  Note”)  in  favor  of  Richard  Seymour  in  the  principal  amount  of 
$1,748,198.26. Nucsafe was primarily obligated to make payments toward the debt, and 
Breton Equity was the guarantor.1

Paragraph  1  of  the  Note  provided  that  it  would  gather  interest  at  a  rate  of  three 
percent per year and that Nucsafe would make the monthly interest payments in the amount 
of  .25%  of  the  remaining  balance  each  month  with  the  first  payment  being  $4,370.50. 
Beginning January 1, 2016, Nucsafe became obligated to pay Mr. Seymour $6,000.00 per 
month. The Note also provided for the award of the cost of collection and all reasonable 
attorneys’ fees in the event of default. Upon execution, Nucsafe began making payments 
pursuant to the terms of the note.

Defendants  and  Mr.  Seymour  subsequently  executed  four separate  addendums  or 
modifications  to  the  Note  on  February  26,  2016;  April  21,  2016;  August  3,  2016;  and 
September 2, 2016, respectively. Under the February 2016 modification, the scheduled due 
dates for monthly payments were changed, and the modification provided that the principal 

                                           

1 For a period of years prior to this transaction, Mr. Seymour served as the President and CEO of 
Nucsafe. At the time of the note’s execution, Lester Sideropoulos served as President and signed the 2015 
Note on behalf of Nucsafe. Ted Doukas, who was President of Breton Equity, signed the guaranty on its 
behalf. Mr. Doukas subsequently became President of Nuscafe as well as Brenton Equity.

- 2 -

payment  amount  due  each  month  would  be  no  less  than  $10,000.00.  The  other 
modifications are not germane to the issues on appeal.2

Nucsafe  made  its  scheduled  monthly  payments  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  Note 
and all subsequent modifications until July 1, 2020, at which time Nucsafe ceased making 
any monthly payments. As a result, Mr. Seymour sent a demand letter and notice of default 
demanding payment of the outstanding balance in August of 2020. When Defendants did 
not cure the default, Mr. Seymour filed the present action for breach of the Note. At the 
time Mr. Seymour filed his complaint in March 2021, the outstanding balance on the Note 
was  $117,544.50.  In  response,  Defendants  filed  a  joint  answer  in  which  they  asserted 
various affirmative defenses including, inter alia, breach of the implied covenants of good 
faith and fair-dealing, lack of consideration, and estoppel.

Mr.  Seymour  passed  away on  June  11,  2021.  Subsequently,  the personal 
representatives  of  Mr.  Seymour’s  estate,  Stephen  Farber  and  John  Maisel  (collectively 
“Plaintiffs”) were substituted as parties in interest.

On  July  9,  2021,  Defendants  responded  to Plaintiffs’ interrogatories. In  their 
response, Defendants denied having knowledge of any facts to support the contentions in 
their Answer to the Complaint that Mr. Seymour breached the implied covenants of good 
faith  and  fair  dealing  or  that  the  Note  and  subsequent  addendums  were  otherwise 
unenforceable. 

Relying on  the  discovery  responses,  Plaintiffs  filed  a  Motion  for  Summary 
Judgment arguing that, because it was undisputed that Nucsafe did not make any payments 
in accordance with the terms of the Note and all subsequent modifications, the estate was
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract claim. 

Defendants  filed  a  response  opposing  summary  judgment,  arguing  that  material 
facts  were  in  dispute  such  that  summary  judgment  was  not  appropriate.  To  support  this 
contention,  Defendants  filed  an  affidavit  by  Ted  Doukas,  the  President  of  Nucsafe  and 
Breton Equity. In his affidavit, Mr. Doukas stated that his review of Nucsafe’s business 

                                           

2 The April 2016 addendum added a new paragraph to the language of the Note which provided 
that if either Defendant paid Mr. Seymour $1,400,000.00 within 120 days of the execution of the addendum,
Mr. Seymour would consider the 2015 Note paid in full. The August 2016 addendum later changed the date 
for payment of the same $1,400,000.00 lump sum payment to any time on or before February 28, 2017. 
Finally, the August 2016 addendum changed the same lump sum payment date to on or before August 31, 
2017.

records revealed that Mr. Seymour had never loaned any money to Nucsafe. To that end, 
Defendants then also argued fraud in the inducement. 

The  trial  court,  however,  declined  to  consider  all  of  Mr.  Doukas’s affidavit  for 
several reasons and ultimately concluded that Defendants failed to create any genuine issue 
as to any material fact for the following reasons: 

and  Amended 

1.  The  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  summary 
judgment.  There is  no  material  issue  of  fact  that  Defendants  executed  the 
Modified 
subsequent 
addendums/modifications, Defendants are in default as they have not made 
any payment pursuant to the Modified and Amended Promissory Note and 
subsequent addendums/modifications  since  June  2020,  or  that  Defendants 
made payments pursuant to the Modified and Amended Promissory Note and 
subsequent addendums/modifications prior to July 2020.

Promissory  Note

and 

2. The Court is of the opinion that Tenn. Code Ann. § 24-1-203, commonly 
known as the Dead Man’s Statute, bars Mr. Doukas’ Affidavit testimony with 
regard  to  any  transaction  with  or  statement  by  Richard  Seymour  (“Mr. 
Seymour”).  The  remaining  Affidavit  testimony  of  Mr.  Doukas  does  not 
create any material issue of fact. 

3.  The  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  Defendants'  purported  fraudulent 
inducement  defense  has  been  waived  for  the  failure  to  plead  fraud  and/or 
fraudulent inducement in an answer as required by Tenn. R. Civ. P. 8.03.3

4. The Court is of the opinion that Tennessee’s cancellation rule precludes 
consideration  of  the  assertions  made  by  Mr.  Doukas  in  the  Affidavit.  See 
Church v. Perales, 39 S.W.3d 149, 169–70 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000) (holding 
“Tennessee  follows  the  rule  that  contradictory  statements  by  the  same 
witness  regarding  a  single  fact  cancel  each  other  out.”).  On  July  9,  2021, 
Defendants responded to interrogatories denying that they have any facts and 
evidence upon which they rely in support of the affirmative defenses in their 
Answer that Mr. Seymour violated the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing 
and/or  that  the  agreements  referenced  in  Mr.  Seymour’s  Complaint  are 

                                           

3 We acknowledge that Defendants make an abbreviated argument in their appellate brief that the 
trial court erred by holding that Defendants waived the defense of fraud because they failed to include the 
defense  in  their  answer  as  an  affirmative  defense  pursuant  to  Tennessee  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  8.03. 
Specifically, they contend that the trial court erred by failing to give Defendants the opportunity to amend 
their Answer. We note, however, that Defendants did not file a motion to amend their pleadings to assert 
fraud as an affirmative defense. Accordingly, this issue is waived.

- 4 -

unenforceable.  Because  these  responses  were  not  supplemented,  the 
cancellation precludes any assertion made by Mr. Doukas to the contrary. 

5.  The  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  Mr.  Doukas’  Affidavit  testimony  that 
“books  and  records”  of  Nucsafe,  Inc.  show  fraudulent  actions  by  Mr. 
Seymour does not create any material issue of fact as such books and records 
have not been produced as required by Tennessee’s best evidence rule. See 
Tenn. R. Evid. 1001, 1002, and 1003. 

7.  The  Court  is  of  the  opinion  that  Plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  a  monetary 
judgment in the amount of $260,710 as of March 2, 2022 pursuant to terms 
of 
the  Modified  and  Amended  Promissory  Note  and  subsequent 
addendums/modifications.  Plaintiffs  are  further  entitled  to  the  award  of 
reasonable  attorneys'  fees  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  Modified  and 
Amended Promissory Note and subsequent addendums/modifications.

In  a  subsequent  order,  the  trial  court  awarded  the  estate $12,445.28  in  attorneys’ 

fees and expenses, resulting in a total judgment of §273,155.28.4

This appeal followed.

ISSUES

Defendants raise one issue for review, stated as follows:

Whether  the  Chancery  Court  for  Anderson  County  erred  in  granting  the 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and entering Judgment in favor of 
the  Plaintiffs  as  there  were  disputed issues  of  material  fact  precluding 
Judgment as a matter of law.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

This court “review[s] a trial court’s decision on a motion for summary judgment de 
novo, without a presumption of correctness.” See Rye v. Women’s Care Ctr. of Memphis, 
MPLLC, 477 S.W.3d 235, 250 (Tenn. 2015). Accordingly, this court must “make a fresh 
determination  of  whether  the  requirements  of  Rule  56  of  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure have been satisfied.” See id. In so doing, we “must view the evidence in the light 
most  favorable  to  the  nonmoving  party  and  must  draw  all  reasonable  inferences  in  that 
party’s favor.” Godfrey v. Ruiz, 90 S.W.3d 692, 695 (Tenn. 2002).

Summary judgment should be granted when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 

                                           

4 In their appeal, Defendants do not challenge the amount of the awards. 

- 5 -

is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment 
as a matter of law.” Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.04. “A disputed fact is material if it must be decided 
in order to resolve the substantive claim or defense at which the motion is directed.” Byrd 
v. Hall, 847 S.W.2d 208, 215 (Tenn. 1993). A “genuine issue” exists if “a reasonable jury 
could legitimately resolve that fact in favor of one side or the other.” Id.

“The moving party has the ultimate burden of persuading the court that there are no 
genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter 
of law.” Martin v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 271 S.W.3d 76, 83 (Tenn. 2008). The moving party 
must support its motion with “a separate concise statement of material facts as to which 
the moving party contends there is no genuine issue for trial.” Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56.03. “Each 
fact  is  to  be  set  forth  in  a  separate,  numbered  paragraph”  and  “supported  by  a specific 
citation to the record.” Id.

ANALYSIS

Defendants argue that the trial court erred by  finding  that Mr. Doukas’s affidavit 
was inadmissible. First, they contend that parts of his testimony do not violate the Dead 
Man’s  Statute.  They  likewise  contend  that  had  this  testimony been  considered,  it  would 
have created a dispute of material fact regarding whether Mr. Seymour ever transferred any 
money to Nucsafe. More specifically, Defendants insist that the Dead Man’s Statute does 
not  preclude  the  court  from  considering  facts  Mr.  Doukas  discovered  while reviewing
Nucsafe’s business records. Second, Defendants also argue that Tennessee’s “cancellation 
rule”  does  not  preclude  consideration  of  the  affidavit  because  none  of  the  statements 
contained in the affidavit contradict prior statements  made by Mr. Doukas. Third, while 
Defendants do not discuss this issue in their brief, Plaintiffs posit that the trial court was 
correct  to  exclude  Nucsafe’s  “books  and  records” under  the  best  evidence  rule because 
Defendants failed to produce originals of the books and records to prove its contents. We 
will consider each argument in turn.

I.

TENNESSEE’S DEAD MAN’S STATUTE

Evidence  presented  in  opposition  to  summary  judgment  must  be  substantively 
admissible. Byrd, 847 S.W.2d at 215–16 (“To permit an opposition to be based on evidence 
that would not be admissible at trial would undermine the goal of the summary judgment 
process  to  prevent  unnecessary  trials  since  inadmissible  evidence  could  not  be  used  to 
support a jury verdict.”). 

Tennessee  Code  Annotated  §  24-1-203,  commonly  known  as  the  Dead  Man’s 
Statute, renders certain testimony inadmissible in order to “protect estates from spurious 
claims  and  prevent  interested  parties  from  giving  self-serving  testimony  regarding 
conversations or transactions” with a decedent. Mitchell v. Johnson, 646 S.W.3d 754, 765 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 2021) (citations omitted). The statute provides:

- 6 -

In  actions  or  proceedings  by  or  against  executors,  administrators,  or 
guardians, in which judgments may be rendered for or against them, neither 
party shall be allowed to testify against the other as to any transaction with 
or statement by the testator, intestate, or ward, unless called to testify thereto 
by the opposite party. If a corporation is a party, this disqualification shall 
extend to its officers of every grade and its directors.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 24-1-203.

The  statute  does  not,  however,  render  a  witness  “wholly  incompetent”  to  testify 
when it is applied. Holliman v. McGrew, 343 S.W.3d 68, 73 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009). Instead, 
the statute simply limits the subjects that a witness may address. Id. For example, the Dead 
Man’s  Statute  prevents “interested  parties  from  giving  self-serving  testimony  regarding 
conversations or transactions with the deceased when the testimony involves transactions 
or  statements  that  would  either  increase  or  decrease  the  deceased’s  estate.”  Mitchell, 
646 S.W.3d  at 765  (citing In  re  Est.  of  Marks,  187 S.W.3d  21,  28  n.2  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
2005)). As an exception to Tenn. R. Evid. 601’s general rule that every person is presumed 
competent to be a witness, the Dead Man’s Statute “must be strictly construed against the 
exclusion  of  testimony  and  in  favor  of  its  admission.” Haynes  v.  Cumberland  Builders,
Inc., 546 S.W.2d 228, 230–31 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1976).

Here, the trial court declined to consider the entirety of Mr. Doukas’s affidavit. The 
transcript from the hearing on the motion for summary judgment reveals the trial court’s 
reasoning for excluding Mr. Doukas’s testimony. The Court found that “the requirements 
for  the  Dead  Man's  Statute  to  kick  in  have  been  met.”  Noting that  Mr.  Doukas  was  the 
president of both defendant entities, Nucsafe and Breton Equity, the court ruled that Mr. 
Doukas 

falls within the statutes encompassing of those persons that would be barred 
under a corporate entity, as he is the president of both. And the subject matter 
that is being barred is a transaction with or a statement made by the testator 
in this case which would have been Richard Seymour.5

We respectfully disagree with this reasoning, at least, in part.

As noted earlier, the Dead Man’s Statute does not preclude testimony regarding all
conversations  and  transactions  a  party  had  with  the  decedent.  Instead,  it  prevents 

                                           

5 While Defendants concede on appeal that some statements contained in Mr. Doukas’s affidavit 
may be inadmissible under the Dead Man’s Statute, they argue that information Mr. Doukas obtained while 
reviewing Nucsafe’s business records is not subject to the Dead Man’s Statute. 

- 7 -

“interested  parties  from  giving  self-serving  testimony  regarding  conversations  or 
transactions with the deceased when the testimony involves transactions or statements that 
would  either  increase  or  decrease  the  deceased’s  estate.”  Mitchell,  646 S.W.3d  at  765 
(emphasis added). Furthermore, because the Dead Man’s Statute must be strictly construed 
against the exclusion of testimony and in favor of its admission, see Haynes, 546 S.W.2d 
at 230–31, evidence Mr. Doukas obtained from Nucsafe’s business records, independent 
of any transaction or conversation with Mr. Seymour, would not violate the Dead Man’s 
Statute. For this reason, we find that the Dead Man’s Statute does not render the entirety 
of Mr. Doukas’s affidavit inadmissible. See Haynes, 546 S.W.2d at 230–31. Accordingly, 
we find the decision to exclude all of Mr. Doukas’s testimony based on the Dead Man’s 
Statute  was error.  Nevertheless,  we  find  the  error  was harmless  because,  as  we  explain 
below, the  trial  court  acted  within  its  discretion  to  exclude  the  bulk  of  Mr.  Doukas’s
testimony based on the cancellation rule and the best evidence rule.

II.

THE CANCELLATION RULE

Under Tennessee’s cancellation rule, “contradictory statements by the same witness 
regarding a single fact cancel each other out.” Helderman v. Smolin, 179 S.W.3d 493, 501 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) (citations omitted). Thus, once a court determines two statements to 
be contradictory, both statements are “considered to be ‘no evidence’ of the fact the party 
seeks  to  prove.” Id. (quoting  Wilson  v.  Patterson,  73 S.W.3d  95,  104  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
2001)). “The  cancellation  rule  only  applies,  however,  ‘when  the  inconsistency  in  the 
witness’s  testimony  is  unexplained  and  when  neither  version  of  his  testimony  is 
corroborated by other evidence.’” Hill v. Tapia, No. M2012-00221-COA-R3CV, 2012 WL 
6697308, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 21, 2012) (quoting Taylor v. Nashville Banner Publ’g 
Co., 573 S.W.2d 476, 483 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1978)).

The trial court’s ruling on this issue reads as follows:

4. The Court is of the opinion that Tennessee’s cancellation rule precludes 
consideration  of  the  assertions  made  by  Mr.  Doukas  in  the  Affidavit.  See 
Church v. Perales, 39 S.W.3d 149, 169–70 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000) (holding 
“Tennessee  follows  the  rule  that  contradictory  statements  by  the  same 
witness  regarding  a  single  fact  cancel  each  other  out.”).  On  July  9,  2021, 
Defendants responded to interrogatories denying that they have any facts and 
evidence upon which they rely in support of the affirmative defenses in their 
Answer that Mr. Seymour violated the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing 
and/or  that  the  agreements  referenced  in  Mr.  Seymour’s  Complaint  are 
unenforceable.  Because  these  responses  were  not  supplemented,  the 
cancellation precludes any assertion made by Mr. Doukas to the contrary. 

We agree with the trial court that Mr. Doukas’s statements regarding the existence 
of records demonstrating that Mr. Seymour never advanced the loan proceeds to Nucsafe 

- 8 -

contradict Defendants’ discovery responses to Plaintiffs’ interrogatories on this subject. In 
July 2021, Plaintiffs asked Defendants to respond to a series of interrogatories regarding 
evidence Defendants relied on to support their affirmative defenses. Acting on behalf of 
Defendants in  his  capacity  as  their president,  Mr.  Doukas  responded to  the  relevant 
interrogatories as follows:

7. Please describe specifically, completely and in full detail all facts 
and  evidence  upon  which  Defendants  rely  in  support  of  the  affirmative 
defense in their Answer that Mr. Seymour’s Complaint is barred in whole or 
in part by the equitable doctrines of laches, estoppel and waiver. 

RESPONSE:  Nucsafe  and  Breton  Equity  do  not  have  responsive 
information at this time as discovery is on-going. Nucsafe and Breton Equity 
will  supplement  as  appropriate  under  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure. 

.

.

.

9. Please describe specifically, completely and in full detail all facts 
and  evidence  upon  which  Defendants  rely  in  support  of  the  affirmative 
defense  in  their  Answer  that  the  agreements  referenced  in  Mr.  Seymour's 
Complaint fall for lack of consideration. 

RESPONSE:  Nucsafe  and  Breton  Equity  do  not  have  responsive 
information at this time as discovery is on-going. Nucsafe and Breton Equity 
will  supplement  as  appropriate  under  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure.

.

.

.

11. Please describe specifically, completely and in full detail all facts 
and  evidence  upon  which  Defendants  rely  in  support  of  the  affirmative 
defense in their Answer that one or more of the agreements referenced in Mr. 
Seymour’s Complaint was not properly executed and is unenforceable. 

RESPONSE:  Nucsafe  and  Breton  Equity  do  not  have  responsive 
information at this time as discovery is on-going. Nucsafe and Breton Equity 
will  supplement  as  appropriate  under  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure.

13. Please describe specifically, completely and in full detail all facts 
and  evidence  upon  which  Defendants  rely  in  support  of  the  affirmative 
defense in their Answer that Mr. Seymour violated the doctrine of good faith 
and fair dealing associated with the agreements at issue. 

RESPONSE:  Nucsafe  and  Breton  Equity  do  not  have  responsive 
information at this time as discovery is on-going. Nucsafe and Breton Equity 
will  supplement  as  appropriate  under  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure.

Notably,  Defendants  never  supplemented  their interrogatory  responses  and  never
informed Plaintiffs of the existence of facts, evidence, or business records that supported 
such claims. Considering these facts, we agree with the trial court that Defendants’ answers 
to the first set of interrogatories constituted an admission by Defendants that they had no 
knowledge of any facts, evidence, or business records to support their claims or affirmative 
defenses. 

In  his affidavit, Mr.  Doukas  stated  that,  sometime  around  August  2020, he 
discovered Nucsafe business records showing that Mr. Seymour had never paid Nucsafe 
the original loan amount. Mr. Doukas stated:

26.  Before  all  of  the  funds  could  be  distributed,  in  August  2020,  one  of 
Nucsafe’s major creditors filed an involuntary Chapter 7 Bankruptcy against 
Nucsafe. 

27. It took months to negotiate a resolution of Nucsafe’s Chapter 7 case. 

28. Around that period of time, began to look more closely into the books 
and  records  of  Nucsafe  and  discuss  the  finances  with  those  who  were 
employed at the time. It then became apparent that Seymour had lied to us 
the entire time. 

29.  Contrary  to  what  he  expressly  represented  to  me  prior  to  him  being 
provided  with  the  October  2015  Note,  Seymour  never  loaned  Nucsafe  the 
money  for  which  he  received  the  original  ‘demand  note’  that  was  later 
replaced by the October 2015 Note. 

Thus,  Mr.  Doukas’s discovery  responses  on  behalf  of  Defendants  cancel  out  the 
evidence  Mr.  Doukas  offered  in  his  affidavit  in  opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  motion  for 
summary  judgment.  Nevertheless,  Defendants  argue  on  appeal  that  there  is  no 
inconsistency between the interrogatory responses and Mr. Doukas’s affidavit because the 
interrogatory answers only asserted that Defendants “did not have any information at [the] 
time.”  While  we  recognize  that  the  cancellation  rule  does  not  apply  to  inconsistent 

- 10 -

responses resulting from inadvertence or misunderstanding, see Hill, 2012 WL 6697308, 
at *6 (citations omitted), it is significant that Mr. Doukas’s affidavit asserts he discovered 
the  discrepancy  in  the  time  prior  to  responding  to  Plaintiffs’  first  set  of  interrogatories. 
Thus, the discovery responses provided on behalf of Defendants stating that Defendants 
did not possess the relevant information at the time of the July 2021 interrogatories is in 
conflict with the statements made by Mr. Doukas in his affidavit. 

As noted earlier, the cancellation rule only applies “when the inconsistency in the 
witness’s  testimony  is  unexplained  and  when  neither  version  of  his  testimony  is 
corroborated by other evidence.” Hill v. Tapia, 2012 WL 6697308, at *5 (quoting Taylor 
v. Nashville Banner Publ’g Co., 573 S.W.2d at 483). The testimony offered by Mr. Doukas
in his affidavit is not only inconsistent with his prior testimony, it is also unexplained and 
neither version of his testimony is corroborated by other evidence. Thus, as the trial court 
concluded, the cancellation rule applies to Mr. Doukas’s testimony.

For these reasons, we affirm the trial court’s decision to not consider that portion of 
Mr. Doukas’s testimony that conflicts with the discovery responses he provided on behalf 
of Defendants.6

III.

BEST EVIDENCE RULE

The trial court found “that Mr. Doukas’ Affidavit testimony that ‘books and records’
of Nucsafe, Inc. show fraudulent actions by Mr. Seymour does not create any material issue 
of fact as such books and records have not been produced as required by Tennessee’s best 
evidence rule.” We agree. 

“To prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, 
recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided[.]” Tenn. R. Evid. 1002. 
“A duplicate is admissible to the same extent as an original unless a genuine question is 
raised as to the authenticity of the original.” Tenn. R. Evid. 1003. The original writing is 
not  required,  and  other  evidence  of  the  writing  is  admissible,  if  all  originals  are  lost  or 
destroyed;  no  original  can  be  obtained;  if  the  original  is  under  the  control  of  the  party 

                                           

6 We also note that the trial court had another basis on which to exclude this evidence. Because 
Defendants failed to supplement their discovery responses on the very subject Mr. Doukas offered in his 
affidavit,  the  trial  court  had  discretion  to  disregard  or  exclude  Mr.  Doukas’s affidavit  testimony.  See
Mercer v. Vanderbilt Univ., Inc., 134 S.W.3d 121, 133 (Tenn. 2004) (“Excluding a witness’s testimony 
may  be  an  appropriate  sanction  for  failure  to  supplement  answers  to  interrogatories.”); see  also  Lyle  v. 
Exxon Corp., 746 S.W.2d 694, 699 (Tenn. 1998); Ammons v. Bonilla, 886 S.W.2d 239, 243 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
1994); Strickland v. Strickland, 618 S.W.2d 496, 501 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981) (stating that trial courts have 
wide discretion to determine appropriate sanctions for abuse of the discovery process). However, neither 
party  raised  this  issue;  accordingly,  we  shall  not  consider  it.  See  State  v.  Bristol,  654 S.W.3d  917,  927 
(Tenn. 2022).

- 11 -

against whom it is offered; or if the writing is not related closely to a controlling issue. See
Tenn.  R.  Evid.  1004.  The  party  seeking  to  prove  the  contents  of  a  writing  generally  is 
required to introduce the original writing or a duplicate. Integon Indem. Corp. v. Flanagan, 
No.  02A01–9812–CH–00382,  1999 WL  492656,  at  *4  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  July  13,  1999)
(citing Tenn. R. Evid. 1002, 1003)). “The rule is premised on the theory that ‘only the best 
or most accurate proof of written or similar evidence should be admitted, to the exclusion 
of  inferior  sources  of  the  same  proof,  absent  some  extraordinary  justification  for  the 
introduction of secondary evidence.’” Iloube v. Cain, 397 S.W.3d 597, 602 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
2012) (citations omitted). 

A nonmoving party can defeat a summary judgment motion by offering evidence in 
an inadmissible form, so long as the evidence can be reduced to an admissible form at trial. 
Byrd,  847 S.W.2d  at 215–16;  see  also  Benjamin  v.  Thomas,  766 F. App’x 834,  837–38 
(11th  Cir.  2019) (“Because  the  accounts  in  the  [nonmoving  party’s]  affidavits  are 
inadmissible [under Fed. R. Evid. 1002 and 1004] and irreducible to admissible form at 
trial, we may not consider them on summary judgment.”). As noted above, the Tennessee 
Rules of Evidence requires a party seeking to prove the contents of a writing to produce 
the original under 1002, a duplicate under 1003, or other evidence under 1004, provided 
one of the exceptions apply. 

Here,  Defendants  merely  offered  Mr.  Doukas’s affidavit  testimony  to  prove  that
“books and records” of Nucsafe show fraudulent actions by Mr. Seymour. Significantly, 
however,  no  “books  and  records”  or  copies  of  such  were  produced or  attached  to  Mr. 
Doukas’s affidavit or  produced  on  summary  judgment.  While  Mr.  Doukas’s affidavit 
testimony qualifies as “other evidence” under Tenn. R. Evid. 1004, Defendants have not 
offered any proof that the originals have been lost or destroyed, are not obtainable, are in 
the possession of the opponent, or are related to collateral matters.

Furthermore,  in  their  July  2021  interrogatories  to  Defendants,  Plaintiffs  asked 

Defendants to:

5. Identify each document or other tangible item of which Defendants 
have  knowledge,  whether  or  not  such  item  is  in  Defendant's  possession, 
custody,  or  control,  that  Defendants  believe  to  be  relevant  to  this  lawsuit, 
including but not limited to any document relied on by Defendants or their 
attorney in preparing these answers. 

Mr. Doukas responded to the interrogatory on behalf of Defendants stating, “See Exhibits 
attached to Complaint.” The only documents attached to Mr. Seymour’s Complaint were
the  2015  Note  and  each  subsequent  addendum  or  modification.  Essentially,  Defendants 
have failed to produce an original, a duplicate, or any proof that one of the exceptions in 
1004 apply. 

- 12 -

For  these  reasons,  we  agree  with  the  trial  court  that  Mr.  Doukas’s statements 
regarding  the  existence  of  business  records  demonstrating  that  Mr.  Seymour  never  paid 
Nucsafe the original loan amount may not be considered evidence of that fact. Defendants 
failed  to  present  any  evidence  that  can  be  reduced  to  an  admissible  form  at  trial.
Accordingly, we agree with the trial court’s finding that there is no genuine dispute as to 
material fact, and we affirm the decision to grant Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment

Having  considered  that  portion  of  Mr.  Doukas’s affidavit  that  is  admissible,  we

agree with the trial court’s ruling that  

[t]here is no material issue of fact that Defendants executed the Modified and 
Amended  Promissory  Note  and  subsequent  addendums/modifications, 
Defendants are in default as they have not made any payment pursuant to the 
subsequent 
Modified 
addendums/modifications  since  June  2020,  or  that  Defendants  made 
payments  pursuant  to  the  Modified  and  Amended  Promissory  Note  and 
subsequent addendums/modifications prior to July 2020.

Promissory  Note 

and  Amended 

and 

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in all respects.

IN CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed, and this matter 
is  remanded  with  costs  of  appeal  assessed  against Nucsafe,  Inc., and  Breton  Equity 
Company Corp.
