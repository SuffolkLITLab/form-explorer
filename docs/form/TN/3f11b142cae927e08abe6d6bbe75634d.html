PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE TENNESSEE

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

and

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

(new text indicated by underlining; deleted text indicated by overstriking)

TENNESSEE RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

RULE 5.02

SERVICE AND FILING OF PLEADINGS AND OTHER PAPERS

[Amend Rule 5.02  as indicated below:]

5.02. Service – How Made.

.     .     .

(2)(a) Service on any attorney or on a party may also be made by emailing the attorney person the 

document  in  Adobe  PDF  to  the  attorney's recipient’s email  address,  which  shall  be  promptly 

furnished on request. The sender shall  include  language in the subject line designed to alert the 

recipient that a document is being served under this rule. On the date that a document served under 

this rule is electronically sent to an attorney a recipient, the sender shall send by mail, facsimile or 

hand-delivery a certificate that advises that a document has been transmitted electronically. The 

certificate shall state the caption of the action; the trial court file number; the title of the transmitted 

document; the number of pages of the transmitted document (including all exhibits thereto); the 

sender's name, address, telephone number and electronic mail address; the electronic mail address 

of each recipient; and the date and time of the transmission. The certificate shall also include words 

to  this  effect:  “If  you  did  not  receive  this  document,  please  contact  the  sender  immediately  to 

receive an electronic or physical copy of this document.” The certificate shall be sent to all counsel 

of record and all self-represented parties.

(b) A sender who emails a document and is notified that it was not received must promptly furnish 

a copy of the document to the attorney person who did not receive it.

(c) A document transmitted by email shall be treated as a document that was mailed for purposes 

of computation of time under Rule 6.

(d) For good cause shown, an attorney or self-represented party may obtain a court order 
prohibiting service of documents on that attorney person by electronic mail and requiring that all 
documents be served under subsection (1) or (3).

Advisory Commission Comment [2023]

Rule 5.02(2) is amended to provide self-represented parties the same convenience in sending and 

receiving documents by email that is afforded to attorneys. Section 5.02(2)(d) provides that a trial 

court may excuse a party from receiving service by email “for good cause shown […] .”  The rule 

is not intended to require pro se litigants who lack regular and reliable email access to find a means 

to acquire it.  When email service is feasible, however, courts should “not excuse the pro se litigant 

from  complying  with  the  same  substantive  and  procedural  rules  that  represented  parties  are 

expected to observe.”  State v. Sprunger, 458 S.W.3d 482, 491 (Tenn. 2015) (Citations omitted).

TENNESSEE RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

RULE 41

SEARCH AND SEIZURE

[Amend Rule 41, as indicated below:]

(a) Authority to Issue Warrant. A magistrate, as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. §40-1-106, with 

jurisdiction  in  the  county  where  the  property  sought  is  located may  issue  a  search  warrant 

authorized by this rule. The district attorney general, assistant district attorney general, criminal 

investigator, or any other law-enforcement officer may request a search warrant.

.     .     .

(c) Issuance and Content of Warrant.

(1) Issuance. A warrant shall issue only on an affidavit or affidavits that are sworn before 

the magistrate and establish the grounds for issuing the warrant. A warrant for electronic 

information pursuant to section (c)(3)(E) of this Rule or for a tracking device pursuant to 

section (i) of this Rule shall issue only on an affidavit sworn before a judge of the chancery, 

circuit, or criminal court.

(2) Requesting a Warrant By Electronic Means. A magistrate may issue a warrant based 

on information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means. In that case, 

the following procedures will apply:

(A) The proposed warrant, the signed affidavit, and accompanying documents may 

be  transmitted  by  electronic  facsimile  transmission  (fax)  or  by  electronic 

transfer (email) with electronic signature to the magistrate, who may act upon 

the transmitted documents as if they were originals.

(i)

If the warrant is being sought by electronic means rather than face-

to-face, the warrant affidavit shall note that it is being submitted by 

electronic means and shall be sworn to or affirmed by administration 

of  the  oath  by  audio-visual  means by  the  magistrate,  and  the 

examination of the affiant by the magistrate may also be by audio-

visual means; provided, the warrant affidavit shall be in writing and 

received by the magistrate prior to the administration of the oath and 

examination of the affiant.

(ii)

If the administration of the oath and examination of the affiant by 

audio-visual  means  is  not  available  either  to  the  magistrate  or 

requesting  officer,  then  the  warrant  affidavit  may  be  sworn  to  or 

affirmed  by  administration  of  the  oath  by  audio  means,  and 

examination of the affiant by the magistrate may be by audio means; 

provided, the warrant affidavit shall  be  in writing and received by 

the  magistrate  prior  to  the  administration  of  the  oath  and 

examination of the affiant. Where the administration of the oath and 

examination of the affiant is conducted by audio means alone, the 

requesting  officer  shall  appear  face-to-face  before  the  issuing 

magistrate within 72 hours of the date and time of the  issuance of 

the warrant. At that time, the officer shall  swear to and affirm the 

oath  previously  given  to the  magistrate  by  audio means.  The  date 

and time of this second oath and affirmation will be documented on 

the original warrant and accompanied by  signatures of the issuing 

magistrate and requesting officer.

(B) The affidavit transmitted via facsimile transmission or electronic transfer with 

electronic signature, received by the  magistrate and the warrant approved by 

the magistrate, shall be deemed originals. Within five days after the execution 

of  the  warrant,  the  officer  to  whom  the  warrant  was  issued  shall  obtain  the 

original affidavit and warrant from the magistrate and file them with the clerk 

of  the  court.  The  issuing  magistrate  shall  retain  a  copy  of  the  warrant  and 

supporting affidavit as part of his or her official records. The issuing magistrate 

shall also issue a copy of the warrant and supporting affidavit with electronic 

signatures to the  affiant.  This  section  does  not  alter the  requirement that the 

affidavit be submitted to the magistrate in writing regardless of the means of 

transmission.

A  magistrate  may  issue  a  warrant  based  on  information  communicated  by  telephone  or  other 

reliable  electronic  means.  The  proposed  warrant,  the  signed  affidavit,  and  accompanying 

documents may be transmitted by electronic facsimile transmission (fax) or by electronic transfer 

with electronic signatures to the magistrate, who may act upon the transmitted documents as  if 

they were originals. If the warrant is being sought by electronic means rather than face-to-face, the 

warrant affidavit shall be sworn to or affirmed by administration of the oath by audio-visual means 

by the magistrate, and the examination of the affiant by the magistrate shall also be by audio-visual 

means; provided, the warrant affidavit shall be in writing and received by the magistrate prior to 

the  administration  of  the  oath  and  examination  of  the  affiant.  The  affidavit  with  electronic 

signature  received  by  the  magistrate  and  the  warrant  approved  by  the  magistrate,  signed  with 

electronic  signature, shall  be  deemed  originals.  The  magistrate  shall  facilitate  the  filing  of  the 

original warrant with the clerk of the court and shall take reasonable steps to prevent tampering 

with the warrant. The issuing  magistrate shall retain a copy of the warrant as part of his or her 

official records. The issuing magistrate shall issue a copy of the warrant, with electronic signatures, 

to the  affiant.  This  section  does  not  alter the  requirement that the  affidavit  be  submitted to the 

magistrate in writing regardless of the means of transmission.

(3) Content. If the magistrate is satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that grounds for 

the application exist, the magistrate shall issue a warrant as follows:

.     .     .

(E) The search warrant may authorize the seizure of electronic storage media and/or the 

seizure or copying of electronically stored information.

(d) Copies and Record of Warrant. The magistrate shall make two copies of the original search 

warrant and one copy of the supporting affidavit prepare an original and two exact copies of each 

search warrant. The magistrate shall keep one copy of the warrant and the copy of the affidavit as 

a part of his or her official records. The other copy of the warrant shall be left with the person or 

persons  on  whom  the  search  warrant  is  served.  The  exact  copy  of  the  search  warrant  and  the 

endorsement are admissible evidence equally authentic.

(e) Procedures to Execute Warrant.

.     .     .

(3) Timely Execution. The warrant must be executed within five days after its date. If the warrant 

authorizes the search and/or seizure of electronic storage media and/or the seizure or copying of 

electronically  stored  information  pursuant  to  section  (c)(3)(E)  of  this  Rule,  the  following 

provisions apply:

(A) If the warrant authorizes an officer to seize electronic storage media or electronically 

stored information, the warrant shall be deemed to be executed when the officer takes 

possession  of  the  electronic  storage  media  or  serves  the  warrant on  the  person(s)  or 

entities in possession of the electronically stored information. 

(B) If the warrant authorizes an officer to search electronic storage media for electronically 

stored  information,  the  warrant  shall  be  deemed  to  be  executed  when  the  officer 

conducts the search of the electronic storage media unless:

(i)

the search of the electronic storage media occurs within 10 days of when the officer 

takes possession of the storage media, in which case the warrant shall be deemed 

to be executed when the officer took possession of the storage media; or

(ii) upon a written showing of good cause made within 10 days of the officer taking 

possession of the storage media, the court grants an extension of up to 60 days for 

the officer to conduct the search of the electronic storage media, and the search 

occurs within the period of time authorized by the court, in which case the warrant 

shall  be deemed to be executed when the officer took possession of the storage 

media.

(g)  Motion  for  Return  or  Suppression  of  Property. A  person  aggrieved  by  an  unlawful  or 

invalid  search  or  seizure  may  move  the  court  pursuant to  Rule  12(b)  to  suppress  any  evidence 

obtained in the unlawful search or seizure. If property was unlawfully seized, the aggrieved person 

may  move  for  the  return  of  the  property.  The  motion  to  suppress  and/or  the  motion  to  return 

property unlawfully seized, may be granted, under applicable substantive law and except as to the 

return of contraband, if the evidence in support of the motion shows that:

.     .     .

.     .     .

(5) the magistrate did not:

(A) comply with the provisions of sections (d) or (i)(8)(C) of this Rule; or

(B) did not endorse on the warrant the date and time of issuance and the name of the 

officer to whom the warrant was issued; or . . .

.     .     .

(i)  Warrant for a Tracking Device. 

(1) As  used  in  this  Rule, the  term  “tracking  device”  means  an  electronic  or  mechanical 

device which permits the tracking of the movement of a person or object.

(2) A warrant for the installation or attachment of a tracking device shall be presented to 

and issued only by a judge of the chancery, circuit, or criminal court. The warrant may 

issue in the same judicial district as the site or location of:

(A) the county where an officer seeking the warrant has jurisdiction; or

(B) the vehicle, container, item, or object the movement of which will be tracked 

by the device.

(3) A  tracking  device  warrant  shall  identify  the  vehicle,  container,  item,  or  object,  the 

movement of which will be tracked by the device.

(4) The  tracking  device  warrant  shall  command  the  installation  or  attachment  of  the 

tracking device authorized by the warrant be completed within a time period no longer 

than five days following issuance of the warrant. The tracking device warrant also shall 

specify a reasonable length of time that the tracking device may be used not to exceed 

30  days  from  the  date  the  warrant  was  issued;  provided  that  the  court  may,  upon  a 

written  showing  of  good  cause,  subsequently  grant  one  or  more  extensions  for  a 

reasonable period not to exceed 30 days each. 

(5) Provided that its issuance otherwise complies with the provisions of this section of Rule 

41, the  tracking  device  warrant  may  be  included  as  part of  an  order  authorizing  the 

interception of communications under Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-6-304. 

(6) Installation  or  attachment  of  the  tracking  device  may  be  accomplished  by  the  law 

enforcement officer, or one of them, to whom it is directed. Other persons may aid such 

officer  at the officer’s  request,  but the  officer  must  be  present  and  participate  in  the 

execution.  

(7) Upon installation or attachment of the tracking device, a return noting the installation 

of the tracking device shall be returned to the issuing judge and may be accomplished 

via electronic means. The return shall include (i) the date and time of the installation or 

attachment of  the tracking  device,  (ii)  the  name  of  the  officer(s)  who  performed  the 

installation or attachment, and (iii) the location of the vehicle, container, item, or object, 

the movement of which will be tracked by the tracking device, at the time of installation 

or attachment.

(8) Deactivation of mobile tracking device.

(A) A tracking device shall be deactivated and removed as soon as practicable after 

the  search  warrant  has  expired.  If  removal  of  such  tracking  device  is  not 

possible, such tracking device shall  be deactivated promptly  and shall  not be 

reactivated without an additional warrant or extension of the original warrant 

and  the  search  warrant  return  shall  state  the  reasons  removal  has  not  been 

completed.

(B) A  tracking  device  which  has  been  deactivated  may  be  accessed  after  the 

authorized warrant has expired solely for the purpose of collecting or retrieving 

tracking data obtained during the period specified by the warrant. 

(C) As used in this sub-section, “deactivate” means to discontinue the ability of a 

tracking device to determine or track the position or movement of a person or 

object.

(9) Copies and record of tracking device warrant.

(A) The officer to whom the warrant was issued shall retain the original until filed 

with the court clerk.

(B) The issuing judge shall retain one copy as a part of his or her official records.

(C) Notwithstanding  the  requirements  of  section  (d) of  this  Rule,  within  10  days 

after the use of the tracking device has ended, the officer to whom the warrant 

was issued shall serve a copy of the warrant and return on all known persons 

whose vehicle, container, item, or object was tracked pursuant to the tracking 

device  warrant.  Service  may  be  accomplished  by  (i)  personally  delivering  a 

copy to each person or (ii) by leaving a copy at each person’s residence or usual 

place of abode with an individual of suitable age and discretion who resides at 

that location and mailing a copy via certified mail to the person’s last known 

address. The court may, upon a written showing  of good cause, grant one or 

more extensions of the 10-day deadline for service for a period not to exceed 

30 days each and not more than 90 days total.

(j) Sealing Affidavits in Support of Warrants. Upon written request of the officer seeking the 

warrant, the magistrate may order that an affidavit or affidavits submitted pursuant to section (c)(1) 

of  this  Rule  be  temporarily  placed  under  seal  if  the  officer’s  request  demonstrates  compelling 

circumstances to justify the need for sealing. 

(1) Any order sealing an affidavit shall expire within 90 days or when the court determines, 

upon  motion of any party, that the circumstances  justifying the request have abated, 

whichever occurs earlier; provided that the court may, upon a written showing of good 

cause, subsequently grant the requesting officer one or more extensions of the 90-day 

deadline for a period not to exceed 90 days each and not longer than the conclusion of 

the criminal investigation. 

(2) This section does not apply to any tracking device warrant that is incorporated into an 

order authorizing the interception of communications, as described in section (i)(5) of 

this Rule, as the confidentiality of such orders is governed by the provisions of Tenn. 

Code Ann. § 40-6-304(f).

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
