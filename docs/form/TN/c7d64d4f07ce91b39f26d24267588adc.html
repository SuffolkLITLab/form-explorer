Effective Date: January  1,2023

Supersedes:  New PolicY

l.  Authority:  Tenn. Const.  art. Vl, S 1; Tenn.  Code  Ann, $ 16-3-502;  and  Tenn.

Code Ann. $ 16-3-803.

Definitions:

A. "Employee"  is any person  who works  for the Administrative  Office  of the

Courts (AOC)  in a fulltime  or part-time  status'

B. "Alternative  Workspace  Solutions  (AWS)" encompasses  three  types of

arrangements  including  :

1. "Work  from Home"  arrangement  provides employees the opportunity  to
work at a place other than his or her regularly assigned  office  location,
such  as the employee's  residence  or an alternate location  approved  by the
employee's supervisor/manager.  An employee using this arrangement  will
woit<  tiom his or her residence,  or other approved alternate  location based
upon  a mutually  agreed upon schedule  by the supervisor  and the
employee. lf a mutually  agreed  schedule  cannot be reached,  the
supervisor  will have the final decision. lf a business need arises,  an
employee may be required to report to the office,  even  if scheduled  to work
from hls or her residence  or other  approved  location. On the days the
employee is not scheduled to work  from  home,  the employee  will report to
his or her regularly assigned  office location.  For employees  utilizing tfi.s
arrangemeni, their residence (or other  approved alternate  location)will  be
their official  designated reporting  station for the days he or she works  out
of the office.

2. "Mobile  Work" arrangement provides  flexibility of schedules  for employees
whose responsibilities  require them  to be away  from the office  for much or
all of the regular workday due to community  interaction.  Mobile workers will
not be assigned  a permanent  office  but will instead utilize the Free
Address opiion  when reporting to the regularly assigned  office location.

3. "Free Address"  arrangement  may  be suitable for an employee  whose

primary  place  to conduct state  business  is in a regularly assigned  building,
but who  frequently  collaborates  with different groups and/or  engages  in a
variety of different  projects.  This arrangement  is also suitable  for Mobile
Work and Work  from Home  employees  when they are physically  present in

Subiect  Alternative  WorksPace Solutions  Policy

lndex #:212 Paqe 2 of 5

the office. This option  includes  an arrangement whereby  employees  utilize
unassigned,  non-permanent  workstations on an as-needed  basis,
Agencies  may require  employees  to reserve  the workspace  in advance, or
the workspaces  may be used on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Purpose: To establish the types  of AWS arrangements,  including Work from
Home,  Mobile  Work, and Free Address,  as well as the AOC  and employee
requirements  for each arrangement  in order to provide  structure  for effective
implementation  and operation  of AWS. AWS, however,  shall not be used  to
allow permanent employment  of employees or people  outside  of the State.

lv.

Application: This policy shall apply consistently among  AOC employees'  This
p6ticy may be adopted for application  to the employees  of the Board  of
itrofessional  Responsibility,  Board of Law Examiners, Commission  on Continuing
Legal  Education, Tennessee  Lawyers  Assistance  Program,  and the Appellate
Court Clerk's  Office.

All employees  in positions  designated  by the AOC  as eligible  are qualified to
participate  in AWS, and all eligible  employees are authorized  to participate  to the
fullest extent  possible  without diminished  individual or organizational  performance.
Employee  understands AWS is a privilege not guaranteed  throughout the term of
employment,  and can be revoked  at any time  at the discretion  of the
Administrative  Director. An employee  may  not be eligible  to participate  in AWS if:

A. He/she  is a new  employee  and needs  to work in-office  for a defined period of

time for successful onboarding;

B. He/she  is subject to official  discipline for performance  or conduct, including

suspension,  demotion,  or recommendation for termination;

C. He/she  has demonstrated  diminished  individual or organizational  performance,

as determined  by a his/her  supervisor;

D. He/she  has violated the terms  of the AWS policy or agreement;

E. His/her  position involves the direct handling  of secure  material  (daily  or on a
frequent  basis),  which  the Deputy Director  in consultation  with the respective
Assistant Director  and the Administrative  Director  determines  is inappropriate
for AWS.  This may include  materials for which the AOC maintains a written
policy restricting  access  or use of the material or for which appropriate
mitigating  lT security  measures  do not exist; or

F. His/her  position requires  daily, or on a defined consistent  basis, onsite  work
activities  that cannot  be handled  remotely  or at an alternative  worksite,

policy: lt is the policy of the AOC that, through  the use of mobile technologies
and flbxible  work schedules,  the AOC will maximize efficiency  of work  processes,
retention  of existing employees,  and recruitment of qualified job candidates'

procedure: Each  Division  Director shall  submit to the AOC Human  Resources
Manager  the job classifications  that are not eligible for AWS, if any. Submissions
will be reviewed for approval  by the Administrative  Director.

vil.

shall be created between  employees  and their supervisors. These  schedules
shall be consistent with the responsibilities  set forth in this Policy.  lf a mutually
agreed  schedule cannot  be reached, the supervisor  shall  have the final
decision.

1. All AOC  Day:  For all employees,  the first and third Wednesdays  of each
month shall  be in-office  days, excluding holidays.  As part of the mutually
agreed  schedule, AOC  employees  participating  in Work  from Home will
work in-office on the first and third  Wednesday  each  month. AIIAOC  Day
can count  towards  an employee's  in-office day for scheduling  purposes.

A. Supervisors  shall have certain  responsibilities which include,  but are not
limited  to, the following:

1. Ensuring implementation  of measures to protect  confidential  information;

2. Ensuring that customer  service  is not adversely  affected  by AWS;

3. Undertaking the necessary  risk assessments  of the office design  and

working  Practices;

4. Clearly  defining  and setting forth the AWS  employee's  responsibilities;

5. Maintaining  effective  communication  with AWS  employees;

result  of AWS (additionalwork,  etc.);

7. Maintaining  responsibility  and accountability for treating  all AWS and non-
AWS  employees  similarly  in acts involving managerial  discretion,  including
but not tlmit6O to: distribution  of assignments  among  employees  in the work
unit, use of appropriate  tracking  and  communication  tools, performance

lndex #:2.12 Paoe 4 of 5

management,  both informal and formal feedback,  performance  coaching,
learning and development,  reassignment, promotions,  retention, and
discipline;

8. Providing advance  notice,  if practicable, to AWS  employees  regarding
requests to report to the regularly assigned office  location  (notice is not
required and does  not absolve  an employee's  responsibility  to be physically
present upon request);  and

9. .Completing any AWS  training for supervisors  and annually  signing an

eligible employee's  AWS Acknowledgment  Form.

B. Employees shall have certain  responsibilities depending  on which AWS
arrangement  is utilized,  including,  but not limited  to, the following:

1. Maintaining established  performance standards;

2. Ensuring that the alternative  worksite  is appropriate  and provides the work
environment,  connectivity,  technology,  resource  aCceSS,  and security
authority consistent  with the work  in which the employee  is engaged;

3. Procuring and providing  internet services appropriate  to the work effort at

their  own  expense;

4. Utilizing the VPN  to protect the AOC network;

5. Maintaining flexibility  and  responsiveness to the needs of the supervisor,

work team, and AOC (communication  and collaboration)  during  usual work
hours;

for all or part of the workday  during  which they would otherwise  be
engaged  in an AWS  arrangement;

7. Documenting AWS work time in accordance with established  AOC time

and attendance  policies;

4

Subiect: Alternative  Workspace  Solutions  Pplqy- lndex  #:2.12 Paqe 5 of 5

10, Properly maintaining  and protecting confidential  information,  and following

data security procedures  at all times, and

11. Completing  any required  AWS training  for employees  and annually signing

an AWS Acknowledgment  Form.

C. Participation  in an AWS arrangement  of Work from Home is based on an
employee's  job responsibilities  as determined  by the AOC. lf an employee's
productivity  decreases or other  performance/conduct  issues arise, the supervisor
should  treit the AWS employee  no differently than  an employee  working in the
regularly  assigned office location. This  means  that  coaching  and counseling
sh-ould  iat<e piace  and, if necessary,  the supervisor has the authority to restrict
AWS and/or  issue disciplinary  action.

D. Employees who participate  in an AWS arrangement  are considered  to be in
an official-duty  status  during  the employee's  designated  work schedule  and must
comply  with applicable policies,  rules, and laws while  on duty in an AWS-
arrangement.'Failure  to adhere  to applicable state and federal  laws and State
and nbC  rules and policies  may result in discipline,  up to and including
dismissal.

E, Employees  are not to use work time for child care or elder care.  AWS  is not  a
substitute  for family care.  AWS participants shall not have the primary
responsibility  for dependent  care during AWS  work schedule.  This will allow  the
employee  to freely focus on performing work.  Work  from Home employees  may
have  situations  where caring  for a dependent  or adult  is necessary for reasons
including,  but not limited  to, a declared  state of emergency,  illness, or temporary
unavailability  of a care provider.  ln such instances,  work  from  home employees
are allowed  io provide  care for those  individuals. However,  employees  must have
supervisor  approval and must ensure such care  does  not interfere  in the
completion  of their duties in a professional  and  timely  manner.  For the
aforementioned  situations,  employees  are responsible for notifying their
supervisor(s)  of the situation for appropriate  review and handling.

F. Employees  are expected  to uphold the same levels of professionalism  when
comm'unicating with external  customers,  coworkers,  and supervisors  through the
various mediums  provided through  an AWS arrangement.  These  virtual etiquette
expectations  include business  appropriate  dress and backdrops,  connectivity
responsi  bi lities, and respectfu I pa  rtici pation.

G.Commute time  from home to work  and  from  work to home are not considered
work hours  and are not compensable.

H. Supervisors  retain  the authority  to deny an employee's  selection  of a particular
alternative  worksite  arrangement  if, in the supervisor's  opinion,  the worksite is not

5

Subiect: Alternative  Workspace  Solutions Policy- lndex  #:2.12 Pase  6 of 5

business  appropriate and/or fails to provide a working environment  compliant
with this Policy.

lX.  Waiver

These requirements  may be waived  by the Chief Justice and/or the Administrative
Director  at any time and  as circumstances  require,  such as severe weather,
natural disaster,  infectious disease,  or other unavoidable circumstance  affecting
the ability to report  to the office.
