OPINION

This appeal arises from an on-going battle between former neighbors.  The parties 
have litigated their grievances for more than a decade, and this is the fifth appeal to this 
Court.    See In  re  Mar.  9,  2012  Ord.,  637  S.W.3d  708  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Dec.  22,  2020), 
perm.  app.  denied (Tenn.  April  8,  2021) (“Goetz  IV”);  In  re  Mar.  9,  2012  Ord.,  No. 
W2016-02015-COA-R3-CV, 2017 WL 2304842 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 26, 2017) (“Goetz 
III”); Autin v. Goetz, 524 S.W.3d 617 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2017) (“Goetz II”); Goetz v. Autin, 
No. W2015-00063-COA-R3-CV, 2016 WL 537818 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 10, 2016), perm. 

03/17/2023app. denied (Tenn. June 24, 2016) (“Goetz I”).1  Some of the history related to the prior 
appeals  is  germane  to  the  instant  appeal.    We  now  turn  to  the  relevant  factual  and 
procedural history.     

I.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

In  March  2010,  Appellees  Donel  Autin  and  his  wife,  Dana  Autin  (together,  “the
Autins”),  filed  a  cause  of  action  against  Appellant  William  Goetz  (“Mr.  Goetz”).    The 
Autins  “alleged  that  Mr.  Goetz  was  guilty  of  defaming,  slandering,  and  intentionally 
inflicting emotional distress on [them] by falsely communicating to third parties that Mr. 
Autin  had  an  adulterous  sexual  relationship  with  Mr.  Goetz’s  former  live-in  girlfriend 
(“Girlfriend”).”  Goetz II, 524 S.W.3d at 620.  The Autins sought damages, an immediate 
temporary  restraining  order,  a  temporary  injunction,  and  a  permanent  injunction.  
Protracted  discovery  ensued,  and,  in  October  2010, the  Autins  filed  a  motion  for  a 
protective order sealing various transcripts and recordings.  Id. at 621.  In November 2010, 
the trial court entered an order sealing “the entire case.”  Id. Despite admonishments by 
the  trial  court,  the  parties’  discovery  disputes escalated  to  the  point that  the  trial  court 
indicated  that  it  would  “hammer”  those  responsible  for  “creating  [the]  mess”  with 
sanctions.  Id. at 621-22.  

Notwithstanding  the trial  court’s  admonishment, further  disputes  arose,  including 
disputes over the retrieval of texts and data from the Autins’ cellphones.  Id. at 623.  In 
February 2012, Mr. Goetz filed a motion to dismiss the Autins’ “lawsuit on the basis of 
spoliation of evidence.”  Id.  “According to Mr. Goetz, [the Autins’] failure to produce all 
text  messages  as  ordered  was  the  result  of spoliation and  was  of  a  nature  and  character 
necessitating  dismissal  of  the  lawsuit.  Mr.  Goetz’s  motion  and  memorandum  were 
accompanied  by  several  documents  that  Mr.  Goetz  asserted  supported  his spoliation
theory.”  Id.  In March 2012, the Autins filed a notice of voluntary nonsuit, and the trial 
court dismissed the matter without prejudice.  Id. The trial court also ordered that the case 
would remain “sealed in perpetuity.”  Id. at 624.

In  April  2012,  Mr.  Goetz  filed  a  motion  to  alter  or  amend  the  trial  court’s  order 
dismissing  the  case  and  asserted  that  the  court  should  lift  the  protective  seal  in  order  to 
permit Mr. Goetz to defend his reputation regarding the Autins’ “frivolous and oppressive 
litigation.”  Id.   In August 2012, the trial court entered an amended order dismissing the 
matter  without  prejudice  and  modifying  the  seal  to  except  the  orders  of  the  court.    The 
                                           
1 Goetz III was designated as a “Memorandum Opinion” pursuant to Rule 10 of the Rules of the Court of 
Appeals  of  Tennessee.    Under  Rule  10,  a Memorandum  Opinion  may  not  be  citied  or  relied  on  in  any 
unrelated case.  However, with respect to the parties, a Rule 10 Memorandum Opinion may serve as “the 
basis for a claim of res judicata, collateral estoppel, law of the case, or to establish a split of authority[.]”  
Tenn. R. Sup. Ct. Rule 4(E)(2); See, e.g., In re Conservatorship of Acree, No. M2013-02588-COA-R3-
CV, 2014 WL 2625472, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 11, 2014).

August 2012 order further noted that

[a]ll  documents  or  other  information  received  by  Counsel  for  Defendant 
William Goetz from AT & T and/or Verizon as a result of subpoenas and/or 
all summaries of the documents bearing any identifiable information, which 
documents were previously ordered to be conspicuously marked and held by 
counsel for Goetz as ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY and which were ordered 
not to be shared for any reason or in any manner with Goetz, or anyone else, 
at any time during the pendency of or after the conclusion of this matter, shall 
not be destroyed or returned to Plaintiffs’ counsel as previously ordered, but 
shall  remain  conspicuously  marked  and  held  by  counsel  for  Goetz  as 
ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY, and shall not to be shared for any reason or in 
any manner with Goetz, or anyone else, at any time during the pendency of 
or after the conclusion of this matter.

Id.   The August 2012 order was not appealed.

In May 2012, which was before entry of the final judgment in the 2010 lawsuit that 
was  pending  in  Division  IV  of  the  Circuit  Court  for  Shelby  County,  Mr.  Goetz  filed  a
separate lawsuit against the Autins and Mr. Autin’s employer, International Paper.  This 
action was heard by Division II of the circuit court. Goetz I, 2016 WL 537818.  The Autins 
filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim; while their motion was pending, Mr. 
Goetz  amended  his  complaint  in  October  2012.    In  his  amended  complaint,  Mr.  Goetz
asserted  causes  of  action  for  defamation,  malicious  prosecution,  abuse  of  process,  and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Id. at *1.   Mr. Goetz asserted that the Autins’ 
2010 lawsuit lacked a reasonable basis and was intended to obscure Mr. Autin’s alleged
affair with Girlfriend.  Id.  Mr. Goetz prayed for damages in the amount of $150,000 for 
attorney’s  fees  and  $1,000,000  in  punitive  damages.    Id. Mr.  Goetz  also  asserted  that 
International  Paper  wrongfully  and  intentionally  concealed  cell  phone  records  that  were 
relevant to the 2010 lawsuit.  Goetz II, 524 S.W.3d at 625.  However, International Paper 
was dismissed by consent order entered on November 2,  2012.  Goetz I, 2016 WL at *1 
n.1.    On  November  26,  2012,  the  Autins  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  for  failure  to  state  a 
claim.  The trial court dismissed the matter with prejudice by order entered on September 
25,  2013.  Id. at  *3.   On  October  25, 2013, Mr.  Goetz  filed  a  motion  purporting  to  be  a 
motion  to  alter  or  amend  the  judgment  pursuant  to  Tennessee  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure 
59.04.  In his motion, Mr. Goetz asserted that the trial court erred by dismissing the matter 
and asserted, for the first time, that his amended complaint stated claims for civil rights 
violations and conspiracy.  Id.  In November 2014, the trial court ruled that Mr. Goetz’s 
post-judgment motion was not a motion to alter or amend the judgment but was a motion 
to reconsider.  It denied the motion by order of November 21, 2014.  Id.   Mr. Goetz filed 
a notice of appeal to this Court, and we affirmed the trial court’s judgment.  Id. at *12.

In  the  meantime,  in  September  2012  the  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  contempt 
arising from alleged violations of the court’s August 2012 order sealing the record in the 
lawsuit filed by the Autins in 2010.  Goetz II, 524 S.W.3d at 625.  Following additional 
discovery, by order of January 4, 2013, the trial court (Division  IV) determined that the 
parties had not alleged criminal contempt and that the allegations in the petitions “cannot 
be fairly the subject of civil contempt.”  Id. The trial court did not rule on the petitions but 
held them in abeyance “until such time as the [c]ourt determines whether . . . to bring sua 
sponte  criminal  contempt  charges  against  either  or  both  of  the  parties.”    Id.    The  court 
observed that neither party had appealed its order sealing the case and that the “case was 
sealed for a reason—to protect Appellees’ minor children[.]”   The trial court ruled:

4. With the following limited exceptions, the parties should leave what is in 
this matter alone:

a. The parties are allowed to use the pleadings and other documents from this 
case for the limited purpose of prosecuting and defending the pending matter 
in Division 2 (No. Ct–002218–12). This limited exception to the seal is not 
intended  to  and  does  not  authorize  the  parties  to  use  or  discuss  the  sealed 
materials outside of the Division 2 litigation.

b. The parties are allowed to use the pleadings and other documents from this 
case for the limited purpose of facilitating International Paper Co.’s pending 
investigation  of  Donel  Autin  until  such  time  as  that  investigation  is 
completed. This limited exception to the seal is limited to International Paper
“individuals  with  a  need  to  know”  and  is  not  intended  to  and  does  not 
authorize  the  parties  to  use  or  discuss  the  sealed  materials  outside  of  the
International Paper investigation. Absent a further order of this [c]ourt, Mr. 
Goetz may not speak at the International Paper Co., Inc. annual shareholders 
meeting about any matters sealed in this Court.

5. The [c]ourt instructs all parties that under no circumstances do they have 
permission to discuss the case beyond what is expressly allowed in this order.

Id. at 625-26.

In May 2015, “Mr. Goetz filed a motion to modify the trial court’s protective order, 
arguing that circumstances had changed such that allowing public disclosure of the facts at 
issue would no longer create such a risk of harm to Appellees’ minor children.”  Goetz II, 
524 S.W.3d at 626.  Mr. Goetz asserted that “modification of the protective order was also 
necessary to clear his reputation in the community” and “that much of the information he 
gleaned in  the  case  was  obtained  outside  of  formal  discovery  processes.”  He  further 
asserted “that the seal ‘implicates the highest scrutiny under the First Amendment.’”  Id.
The Autins responded in opposition to Mr. Goetz’s motion, and, in August 2015, the trial 
- 4 -

court  denied  Mr.  Goetz’s  request  for  a  hearing  on  the  matter  until  the  conclusion  of  his
appeal in Goetz I.  Id.   

In  September  2015,  Mr.  Goetz  filed  a  motion for  sanctions  against  the  Autins 
pursuant  to  Rule  11  of  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.    Id. at  626-27.    In  his 
motion, Mr. Goetz alleged that the Autins had made false allegations against him in their 
response  to  his  motion  to  modify  the  protective  seal.    Id. at  627.    He  sought  “all  fees 
incurred . . . in defense of [the Autins’] fraudulent lawsuit.”  Id. The Autins responded in 
opposition to the motion, and Mr. Goetz withdrew his motion.  Id. The trial court entered 
an order denying the motion for sanctions as moot.  Id.

In  December  2015,  the trial  court  entered  its  final  order,  wherein  it  denied  Mr. 
Goetz’s request for modification of the protective order.  Id. Specifically, the trial court 
ruled:

1.  This  case  was  filed  in  2010.  The  case  has  now  been  closed  effectively 
almost three years. There was no appeal from the rulings in this case.

2. Mr. Goetz filed a second lawsuit in Division II of the Circuit Court, which 
was dismissed on motions and is now on appeal. Mr. Goetz did not choose 
to  file  an  appeal  that  said  he  disagreed  with  anything  this  [c]ourt  did.  He 
simply chose to file a separate lawsuit.

3. This  [c]ourt[’s]  rulings  are  res  judicata,  and  the  [c]ourt  is  not  going  to 
accept the request to modify its prior rulings.

4. The pleadings were sealed[ ] but not the orders. The parties clarified their 
intent in two orders in the litigation in 2012.

5. Mr[.] Goetz was represented by counsel[.] He has had an opportunity to 
have  his  day  in  court,  both  in  Division  IV  and  in  Division  II.  The  [c]ourt 
believes he took advantage of that opportunity to the extent he wanted to.

6. Mr. Goetz had an opportunity to file an appeal. He elected not to do that. 
The [c]ourt is not inclined, three years later, to deal with those issues again.

Id.    Mr.    Goetz  filed  a  timely  notice  of  appeal  to  this  Court  and  raised  three  issues  for 
review (as we slightly restated them):

1.  Does  a  trial  court  retain  jurisdiction  to  enter  a  permanent  injunction  in 
favor of a plaintiff after the plaintiff files a notice of nonsuit?

2.  Did  the  trial  court  err  by  granting  relief  of a  permanent  injunction  after 
- 5 -

applying a legal standard properly limited to protective orders?

3.  Did  the  trial  court  err  by  refusing  to  consider  evidence  of  changed 
circumstances material to an ongoing order?

Id. at 628.  

On appeal, this Court determined that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction over 
the protective order, which was in place when the Autins filed their notice of nonsuit.  Id.
at 634.  In so holding, the Goetz II court noted “that a nonsuit does not take effect until the 
entry of the order of nonsuit, rather than at the time the notice of  voluntary dismissal is 
filed.”  Id. at 637 (citing see Green v. Moore, 101 S.W.3d 415, 419-420 (Tenn. 2003)).  
The  Goetz II court  determined  that  Mr.  Goetz’s appeal  challenging  the  legal  standard 
applied by the trial court in its August 2012 order was not properly before it.  Id. at 638-
39.  This Court determined, however, that the trial court erred by dismissing Mr. Goetz’s 
motion to modify its protective order on the basis that it was barred by the doctrine of res 
judicata  Id. at 640-41.  The Goetz II court stated:

Because modification of protective orders has been expressly authorized by 
our supreme court, res judicata will not serve as a bar to modification so long 
as  the  movant  can  show  the  quantum  of  proof  required  to  support 
modification. . . . The trial court therefore erred in refusing to even consider 
Mr. Goetz’s proof to determine whether a modification was warranted under 
the standard.

Id. at 640 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the Goetz II court vacated the trial court’s order 
denying  Mr.  Goetz’s request  for  modification  of  the  protective  order  and  remanded  the 
matter for further proceedings.  Id.

In  November  2015,  under  a  different  docket  number,  Mr.  Goetz  instituted  an 
additional proceeding styled “In Rem Petition to Vacate March 9, 2012 ‘Order.’”  Goetz 
III, 2017 WL 2304842, at *1.  In his petition, Mr. Goetz asserted “that the March 9, 2012 
order was the ‘res’ of the in rem proceeding and that no parties were named as defendants 
or served with summons.”  Id. As we summarized in Goetz III:

The In Rem Petition asked the court to declare the March 9, 2012 order void 
ab initio on the basis that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate 
any  matters  from  the  moment  the  Autins’ written  notice  of  nonsuit  was 
presented to the court, with the exception of entering a ministerial pro forma 
order confirming “the already effectuated dismissal.”  In other words, the In 
Rem  Petition  asserted  that  the  Autins’ defamation  case  was  effectively 
dismissed at the moment the notice of nonsuit was delivered, and therefore, 
the trial court lacked authority to include a ruling in its order of dismissal that 
- 6 -

the  protective  order  would  remain  in  effect.  The  In  Rem  Petition  also 
contended that the trial court’s March 9, 2012 order extending the protective 
order  was  essentially  a  permanent  injunction  that  restrained  Goetz  in 
violation  of  his  constitutional  rights  to  free  speech.  The  In  Rem  Petition 
requested that the March 9, 2012 order be declared void and stricken from 
the record of the court.

Id. The  Autins,  who  had  not  been  served  with  Mr.  Goetz’s  petition,  filed  a  motion  to 
intervene in the matter, and the trial court granted their motion in July 2016.  Id. at *2.  Mr. 
Goetz “began to insist that the In Rem Petition he filed was ‘mislabeled’ as an ‘independent 
action,’ and  that  it  was  actually  a Rule  60.02 ‘motion,’  despite  the  fact  that  it  was  filed 
under a separate docket number and case style.”  Id.

In September 2016, the trial court dismissed the In Rem Petition with prejudice.  Id.  
The trial court noted that Mr. Goetz’s attempt to proceed through the In Rem Petition was 
an attempt to seek “the same relief he requested via a different case and a different docket 
number[.]” Id.  The trial court concluded that Mr. Goetz’s petition was a distinct action as 
opposed to a Rule 60.02 motion; therefore, the trial court concluded that a summons and 
service  on  the  Autins  was  required.    Id. The  trial  court  dismissed  the  petition  on  the 
doctrine of res judicata.  The trial court further observed: “No case begs for finality more 
than  this  case.  The  cost  to  these  parties  thus  far,  for  attorneys’ fees,  is  simply 
unconscionable.”  Id.  Mr.  Goetz filed a notice of appeal to this Court in September 2016.  
Id.

This Court issued its Opinion in Goetz II while Mr. Goetz’s September 2016 appeal 
was pending.  In Goetz III, we affirmed the trial court’s dismissal on the doctrine of res 
judicata.  Id. at *5.  The Goetz III Court noted:

For all of the parties’ disputes over whether this Rule 60 proceeding should 
be construed as a motion or an independent action, or a proceeding in rem 
versus a proceeding in personam, it is easy to lose sight of the substantive 
issues  that Goetz  raised  in  his  so-called  In  Rem  Petition.    Essentially,  he 
asked the court to declare the March 9, 2012 order void ab initio on the basis 
that the trial court instantaneously lost jurisdiction to adjudicate any matters 
regarding the protective order at the moment that the Autins delivered their 
notice of nonsuit. Goetz argued that the protective order was null and void 
and  in  violation  of  his  constitutional  rights  to  free  speech.  This  Court 
considered and rejected these very same arguments in [Goetz II]. Not only 
did we address in general the effect of a nonsuit on the ability of a trial judge 
to extend a protective order, we specifically held that the March 9, 2012 order 
entered in the original Autin–Goetz litigation is not void for the very same 
reasons asserted by Goetz in this proceeding.  For the reasons stated by this 
Court  in  [Goetz  II],  we  again  conclude  that  the  March  9,  2012  order 
- 7 -

extending  the  protective  order  is  not  void  for  lack  of  subject  matter 
jurisdiction.

Id. at *4 (citing Tenn. R. Sup. Ct. 4(G)(1) (“An unpublished opinion shall be considered 
controlling authority between the parties to the case when relevant under the doctrines of 
the law of the case, res judicata, [and] collateral estoppel” and “for all other purposes shall 
be considered persuasive authority”); Creech v. Addington, 281 S.W.3d 363, 383 (Tenn. 
2009) (“[U]nder the law of the case doctrine, an appellate court’s decision on an issue of 
law is binding in later trials and appeals of the same case if the facts on the second trial or 
appeal are substantially the same as the facts in the first trial or appeal.”)).  

The  Goetz  III court  also  determined  that  Mr.  Goetz’s  appeal  was  frivolous  and 
devoid of  merit and granted the Autins’ prayer for attorney’s fees on appeal pursuant to 
Tennessee Code Annotated section 27-1-122.  Id. at *5.  The matter was remanded to the 
trial court to determine the amount of attorney’s fees.  Id.

On remand, by order entered in June 2019, the trial court ordered Mr. Goetz to pay 
the Autins attorney’s fees in the amount of $11,901.35.  Goetz IV, 637 S.W.3d at 709-10.  
In July 2019, Mr. Goetz filed a 59-page motion to alter or amend the judgment and asserted, 
“for  the  first  time,  that  the  trial  court’s  order  was  ‘void ab  initio’ because  it  was 
‘adjudicated by an adjudicator with compromised neutrality in violation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment[.]’”  Id.  “The trial court treated this as a request for recusal “embedded” in 
the motion to alter or amend and denied the motion in all respects.”  Id. at 710.  Mr. Goetz 
appealed, and this Court affirmed the trial court’s judgment.  Id.

The current appeal arises from a petition filed by Mr. Goetz on March 13, 2019, as 
amended  on  March  14,  2019.    In  his  “First  Amended  Petition  for  Criminal  Contempt” 
(“petition” or “2019 petition”), Mr. Goetz asserted that “Petitioner, at all times relevant to 
the  instant  claim  for  relief,  was  and  remains  a  sui  juris adult  human  person[]”  and  “a 
resident citizen of Shelby County, Tennessee.”  In his petition, Mr. Goetz further asserted 
that,  “in  furtherance  of  [a]  703  Fraud  Against  State[,]”  the  Autins, “on  May  12,  2010, 
initiated an official proceeding, by an oath-made complaint, which included no prayer for 
monetary relief” in a “civil lawsuit proceeding” against him.  Mr. Goetz asserted that the 
Autins  had  committed  “aggravated  perjury  in  violation  of Tennessee  Code  Annotated 
section  39-16-703(a),  a  Class  D  felony  .  .  .  used  to  further  a  fraud  .  .  .  on  the  State  of 
Tennessee . . . by and through State’s agencies, i.e., Shelby County, Tennessee Chancery 
Court, the Shelby County, Tennessee Circuit Court and the Tennessee Court of Appeals[.]”  
In his complaint, Mr. Goetz submitted that

[t]he ultimate object of the 703 Fraud Against State (hereinafter “703 Fraud 
Against  State  Ultimate  Object”)  (infra at  paragraphs  13,  15,  82,  84) 
continued up through January 30, 2019 (infra at paragraph 22) was to use 
the 703 Aggravated Perjury (supra at paragraph 9) to trick and deceive State
- 8 -

(supra at  paragraph  9),  by  and  through  the  State’s  Agencies (supra at 
paragraph 9), to accept the 703 Aggravated Perjury (supra at paragraph 9) as 
the truth and, based on the acceptance of the 703 Aggravated Perjury (supra
at paragraph 9) as truth, to exercise the force and the threat of force of State
(e.g.,  incarceration)  (infra at  paragraph  89)  and  to  use  a  prior  restraint  to 
censor the right of Petitioner (guaranteed by  the First  Amendment, United 
States Constitution, and Tennessee Constitution, Article I, § 19) to speak the 
truth (hereinafter “Petitioner’s Free Speech Right To Speak The Truth”)
(infra at paragraphs 81, 84, 88, 89).

(Emphases in original).  

Mr.  Goetz  asserted  that,  by  their  “perjured”  complaint,  the  Autins  wrongfully 
invoked “the State’s force and authority . . . to order Petitioner to submit Petitioner’s person 
to the jurisdiction (authority) of State Agency/Chancery Court . . . to invoke  State force 
and  authority  .  .  .  at  the  discretion  of  State’s  Agency/Chancery  Court .  .  . to  require 
Petitioner to do or not to do what State Agency/Chancery Court . . . directed Petitioner to 
do or not to do[.]”  (Emphases in original).

In his petition, which “Reserved” several numbered paragraphs, Mr. Goetz recited 
some  of  the  text  messages  allegedly  exchanged  between  Mr.  Autin  and  Girlfriend;
according  to  Mr.  Goetz,  these  messages  were  evidence  of  an  extramarital  affair.    In 
summation,  Mr.  Goetz  asserted that the  Autins:  (1) “perjured”  themselves  in  their 2010
complaint and in court; (2) spoiliated cellphone evidence sought by Mr. Goetz in discovery;
and  (3) continued  to  wrongfully  use  the  courts  to  “deprive  Petitioner  from  exercising 
Petitioner’s Free Speech Right To Speak The Truth[.]”  In his prayer for relief, Mr. Goetz 
sought: (1) a finding that the Autins were in criminal contempt of court; (2) “a judgment . 
. . imposing such punishment as the [c]ourt determines is appropriate, equal to the ordinary 
punishment  for  a  Class  D  Felony”; (3)  reimbursement  of  “(1)  attorneys’ fees  and  costs 
incurred  in  defending  the  aforesaid  fraudulently  made  claims and  accusations,  (2)  in 
securing  restoration  of  Petitioner’s  constitutional  right  to  free  speech  guaranteed  by  the 
First Amendment, United States Constitution and Tennessee Constitution, Art 1, Section 
19 and (3) preparation and prosecution of this petition, in an amount of no less than five 
hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars, with the amount continuing to increase as long as 
this case continues to require prosecution; and (4) any other relief deemed just and proper 
by the court.

On  April 17,  2019,  the  Autins  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  Mr.  Goetz’s  petition  for 
failure to state a claim and for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Specifically, the Autins 
asserted  that  the  circuit  court  did  not  have  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over the  criminal 
offense  of  aggravated  perjury.    The  Autins  further  asserted that:  (1) Mr.  Goetz  did  not 
properly initiate the criminal proceedings; (2) his allegations did not support “civil claims 
for aggravated perjury or spoliation”; (3) Mr. Goetz’s claims were barred by the applicable 
- 9 -

statutes of limitations; and (4) negotiations and offers made during court-ordered mediation 
in  earlier  litigation  were  privileged  and  protected.    The  Autins  also  asserted  that  Mr. 
Goetz’s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata and the established law of the 
case.  On May 21, 2019, the Autins filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Tennessee Rule 
of Civil Procedure 11 (“Rule 11”).  In their motion, the Autins asserted that Mr. Goetz’s
March 14 petition was filed in violation of Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11.02,
discussed  infra.  The  Autins  attached,  to  their  motion, the  trial  court’s  revised  ruling  of 
August 16, 2013, and the court’s January 2019 order on Mr. Goetz’s motion to modify the 
2012  order  sealing  the  matter  in  perpetuity.    In  their  motion  for  sanctions,  the  Autins 
repeated the grounds asserted in their motion to dismiss.  They submitted that Mr. Goetz’s 
petition reiterated the allegations that Mr. Goetz had made in previous litigation and that 
“only the relief demanded [was] different.”  They asserted that the petition was barred by 
the doctrine of res judicata and that:

By  thinly-disguising  his  allegations  in  criminal  contempt  and  aggravated 
perjury,  Goetz  inappropriately  seeks  to  resurrect  long-dismissed  abuse  of 
process,  malicious-prosecution,  defamation,  spoliation,  and  other  claims, 
which he now recasts as a “Fraud Against-the State.”  

The Autins also  asserted  that, in  a  November  14,  2018  petition  for  criminal 
contempt, which Mr. Goetz voluntarily dismissed in January 2019, Mr. Goetz purported to 
“come by and through the undersigned District Attorney General for the Thirtieth District 
of Tennessee on relation of William Goetz (Nov. 14, 2018 Contempt Pet. (CT:005191-71-
8)-71).”  They further asserted that, in his March 13, 2019 contempt petition, Mr. Goetz
“again purported to ‘come by and through the undersigned District Attorney General for 
the Thirtieth District of Tennessee on relation of William Goetz[.[]’”).  They submitted, 
“[n]otably, Goetz dropped this ex rel strategy in his March 14, 2019 Amended Contempt 
Petition, and purports to sue the Autins in his own name only.”  The Autins maintained that 
the  trial  court  “[did]  not  have  jurisdiction  to  hear  a felony criminal  case in  the manner 
attempted by Goetz—whether directly or ex rel.”

In addition to the jurisdictional defects, the Autins also asserted that Mr. Goetz had 
followed neither the procedure for bringing a criminal perjury action set-forth in Tennessee 
Code  Annotated  section  40-3-101, nor  the  Tennessee  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  42 
procedures, which govern criminal contempt proceedings arising out of civil actions.  The 
Autins  submitted  that  Tennessee  does  not  recognize  civil  claims  for  spoliation  or 
aggravated perjury.  They also submitted that the four-year statute of limitations for a Class 
D felony set-forth at Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-2-101(b)(3) barred any claims 
for actions that occurred before November 14, 2014.  The Autins prayed for dismissal of 
Mr. Goetz’s petition, attorney’s fees, and costs.  They also prayed for an award of monetary 
sanctions against Mr. Goetz and other relief as deemed necessary by the court.  

- 10 -

On  May  31,  2019,  Mr.  Goetz  filed  a  pleading  styled  “Notice  of  Partial  Nonsuit 
Without Prejudice[.]” The trial court did not enter an order on the pleading.  On June 6, 
Mr. Goetz filed a response to the Autins’ motion to dismiss. On July 7, 2019, Mr. Goetz 
filed a pleading styled “First Amended Petition for Criminal Contempt (With Nonsuited 
Prayer for Relief Omitted)[.]”

Following  a  hearing  on  March  1  and  March  18,  2021,  the  trial  court  granted  the 
Autins’  motion  to  dismiss  for  failure  to  state  a  claim  and  for  lack  of  subject-matter 
jurisdiction by order entered September 29, 2021.2  In its order, the trial court determined 
that  there  is  no  civil  action  for  aggravated  perjury in  Tennessee and  that  “the  only 
appropriate venue for pursuing the criminal claim would be in the criminal courts via the 
Shelby County District Attorney.”  The court found that the District Attorney had declined 
to bring the suit and that “[w]hile [Mr. Goetz] argued that this matter was being brought 
solely for the vindication of the Courts and it was not about him at all this is contrary to
the  pleadings.”    The  court  also  determined  that,  although  not  “explicitly  stated”  by  this 
Court or the Tennessee Supreme Court, the federal courts have held that Tennessee does 
not recognize an independent cause of action for spoliation of evidence.  The trial court 
also found that it had not entered an order on Mr. Goetz’s notice of nonsuit, and accordingly 
determined that the petition filed by Mr. Goetz in July 2019 was not before it.  The court 
determined that Mr. Goetz’s March 14, 2019 petition failed to state a claim on which relief 
can be granted and that Mr. Goetz did not have standing to bring the claims asserted in his 
petition for contempt.  The trial court dismissed Mr. Goetz’s petition with prejudice and 
reserved the Autins’ motion for sanctions and prayer for attorney’s fees pursuant to section 
20-12-119.

On October 14, 2021, Mr. Goetz filed a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 59.04 
motion to alter or amend the trial court’s judgment.  In his motion, Mr. Goetz asserted that: 
(1) the  trial  court  erred  by  ruling  that  his  May  2019  notice  of  partial  nonsuit  was  not 
effective when filed; (2) the only petition properly before the court was Mr. Goetz’s July 
29, 2019 petition; (3) the trial court’s order did not adjudicate the merits of that petition; 
(4) “there is a sense in which the July 29 Petition is of no consequence in that, had the July 
29 Petition never been filed, the March 14 Amended Petition would have remained before 
the Court with the prayer for relief nonsuited”; (5) “the substantive significance of the July 
29 Petition was to restate, precisely, the claims made in the March 14 Amended Petition, 
without  the  prayer  for  relief”; and  (6)  “the  July  29  Petition  was  not  a  new  or  a  second 
amendment, which would have required leave of Court but a restatement of the March 14 
Amended Petition without the nonsuited prayer for relief.”  Mr. Goetz also asserted that 
the trial court erred by dismissing the matter with prejudice because 

                                           
2 It appears from the record that the matter was transferred from Division II to Division VIII of the Circuit 
Court in October 2019.

- 11 -

a dismissal “pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. R 12.02(6)” is not a dismissal “with 
prejudice” because the only holding is that the pleading before the Court does 
not state a claim but does not preclude the possibility that a claim stated in 
another pleading would be sufficiently pled, e.g., a claim stated in the July 
29 Petition (or some other pleading) which the Dismissal Order does not rule 
is not before the Court but merely erroneously states is not “properly” before 
the Court.

Mr. Goetz further asserted:

taking the erroneous holding that the absence of a Rule 41.03 order keeps the 
May 31, 2019 notice of partial nonsuit from being effective to be a correct 
holding,  the  supposedly  “missing” Rule  41.03  order,  according  to  the 
Dismissal Order rational, makes the July 29 Petition “properly” before the 
Court,  i.e.,  the  Dismissal  Order,  in  substance,  is  the  theretofore  “missing”
Rule 41.03 order.

He also asserted that

the  Dismissal  Order  erroneously  adjudicates  standing  based  on  standards 
applicable  to  an  in  personam suit  by  an  in  personam plaintiff  seeking  in 
personam recovery to compensate for in personam injuries, none of which 
appertain in the instant case.

Finally, Mr. Goetz argued that the trial court had “misconstrue[d]” the purpose of citations
in his brief to cases in which a trial court held a party in contempt for the violation of a 
court  order  and  submitted  that  the  purpose  of  the  citations  was  “to  document  that  civil 
courts  have  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  cases  where  the  subject  matter  is  whether  the 
defendant is guilty of criminal contempt, without any limitation on the case in which the 
criminal contempt occurred.”3

The Autins opposed Mr. Goetz’s motion to alter or amend. Following a hearing in 
November 2021, the trial court denied the motion by order of March 7, 2022.  Mr. Goetz 
filed a notice of appeal in this Court on March 29, 2022.  On April 3, Mr. Goetz filed a 

                                           
3 In his October 2021 motion to amend, Mr. Goetz also stated:

the  Dismissal  Orders  above  quoted  words  speak  a  personal  state  of  mind  (i.e.,  a 
prejudgment that Petitioner's lawsuit, in the opinion of the judge, is not one that should be 
prosecuted) that, reasonably construed, raises an unanswered question, not here sought to 
be  resolved,  about  whether  the  adjudicator  adjudicated  the  Dismissal  Order  with  an 
unconstitutional appearance (actualities aside) of undermined neutrality.

- 12 -

Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 22 motion, wherein he moved the Court 

to dismiss the instant appeal on the ground that the “judgment” of the trial 
court  is  coram  non  judice (a  non-judgment)  because  (1)  the  case  below 
terminated on May 31, 2019 by Movant’s filed notice of voluntary nonsuit 
and (2) by the fact that the appellate jurisdiction of this Court does not enable 
this  Court  to  review  a  coram  non  judice non-judgment  of  a  trial  court; 
therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with  a mandate (in the nature of a 
writ of mandamus) to the trial court ministerially to enter the pro forma order 
required  to  be  ministerially  entered  following  the  filing  of  a  voluntary 
nonsuit.

On April 12, 2022, we denied the motion on our determination that it did not comply with 
Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure 22.   

Meanwhile, on November 10, 2021, Mr. Goetz filed, in the trial court, a motion to
“summary dismiss” the Autins’ motion for Rule 11 sanctions as “non-justiciable.”  In his 
motion, Mr. Goetz asserted that the Autins’ motion became moot following his May 2019 
notice  of  partial  nonsuit  pursuant  to  Rule  41.01.    He  asserted  that  entry  of  an  order  of 
nonsuit by the trial court was “purely a ministerial act,” and that unlike a judgment, which 
is an action of the court, “[t]he ministerial entry of the pro forma order is an adjudicator’s 
act.”  Mr. Goetz submitted that “[f]ailing to keep in mind that adjudicators are not courts 
sometimes causes confused thinking.”  He argued:

Where a notice of nonsuit has been filed, the nonsuit has been “taken,” and 
this is the equivalent of a judgment previously rendered by the court, even 
though the court had nothing to do with or control over whether the plaintiff 
took  (past  tense)  the  nonsuit.  The  nonsuit  happened  and  automatically 
imposed on the adjudicator a ministerial duty (enter a pro forma order) over 
which  the  adjudicator  has  no  more  control  than  the  adjudicator  had  any 
control over the plaintiff noticing [taking] the nonsuit.   

Mr. Goetz asserted that the May 2019 “nonsuit eliminated the Sanctions Motion, rendering 
it the same as if never filed and rendering the case, in its entirety, as if the case was never 
filed and rendering the Court jurisdictionless in relation to the Sanctions Motion as well as 
the then yet to be filed motion to dismiss.” The trial court heard the matter on December 7 
and denied Mr. Goetz motion to dismiss the Autins’ motion for sanctions by order entered 
March 7, 2022.  The trial court determined the motion was not moot because “[a]t no time 
prior  to  the  entry  of  the  Order  Granting  the Motion  to  Dismiss  did  counsel  for  Plaintiff 
attempt  to  enter  an  Order  of  Voluntary  Non-suit  dismissing  a  portion  or  all  of  its  case, 
instead proceeded to zealously litigate this matter throughout.”  The trial court determined 
that it retained jurisdiction to adjudicate the Autins’ motion for sanctions after it granted 
their motion to dismiss with prejudice.

- 13 -

On April 4, 2022, Mr. Goetz filed a “Notice of Candidacy” to

give[]  notice  that  counsel  of  record  for  Petitioner  has  a  pending  candidate 
nominating  petition,  awaiting  approval  on  confirming  the  nominating 
signatures  to  become  a  candidate  for  election  to  serve  as  Circuit  Judge, 
Division 8 of the Shelby County, Tennessee Circuit Court, Thirtieth Judicial 
District of Tennessee (Exhibit A hereto), an office for which The Honorable 
Robert S. Weiss, Circuit Court Judge, is a candidate in the same election.

In his notice, Mr. Goetz stated that he would not make a motion for recusal but asserted:

Williams v. Pennsylvania, 579 U.S. 1 (2016) has dispensed with the necessity 
for  motions  to  recuse  and  shifted  to  judges  the  burden,  sua  sponte,  to 
withdraw  if,  objectively  considered  (rather  than  the  judge’s  subjective 
belief), a neutral third person, would consider that a factor known to the judge 
would  appear  to  such  third  person  to  undermine  the  judge’s  neutrality, 
irrespective of whether, in actuality, the factor would undermine the judge’s 
neutrality.  Thus,  whether  The  Honorable  Robert  S.  Weiss  chooses  to 
withdraw  is  a  choice for  The  Honorable  Robert  S.  Weiss  to  make  and  the 
choice will be reviewed, if necessary, on the record appeal.

The  trial  judge sua  sponte recused  himself on  April  6, and  the  matter  was  assigned  to 
Division V of the circuit court.  Mr. Goetz filed a motion to stay further proceeding pending 
a ruling by this Court with respect to his March 2022 notice of appeal of the trial court’s 
order granting the Autins’ motion to dismiss.  The trial court heard the motion on April 22, 
and denied it by order entered April 26, 2022.  

The trial court also heard the Autins’ motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11.03 
on April 22, 2022.  By order entered May 2, 2022, the trial court determined that Rule 11 
sanctions against Mr. Goetz’s attorney, Larry E. Parrish (“Mr. Parrish”), were warranted.  

In its May 2022 order, the trial court found that: (1) the March 14, 2019 compliant 
filed by Mr. Parrish on behalf of Mr. Goetz sought reimbursement in an amount not less 
than $500,000.00; (2) the court did not enter any order on the notice of “partial dismissal” 
filed  in  2019;  (3)  Mr.  Parrish neither  requested  nor  sought  “voluntary  dismissal  of  the 
Contempt Petitions as a whole[;]” (4) the court specifically reserved the issue of sanctions 
in its September 2021 order dismissing the contempt petitions for failure to state of claim 
and for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; and (5) Mr. Parrish nevertheless filed a motion 
to  dismiss  the  Autins’  motion  for  sanctions  as  moot  and  nonjusticiable.    The  trial  court 
found:

- 14 -

Parrish premised the Contempt Petitions on claims that Respondents were in 
contempt because of behavior as plaintiffs in a 2010 lawsuit. The Contempt 
Petitions, like pleadings in prior suits in 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2018 [filed] 
by Petitioner, alleged perjury and abuse of process[.] The only difference is 
the Contempt Petitions seek redress for Respondents’ alleged contempt by 
perjury and abuse of process instead of seeking redress for alleged perjury 
and abuse of process. The possibility the Contempt Petitions were signed and 
filed in good faith is remote inasmuch as, at the time Parrish signed and filed 
the Contempt Petitions, the court had already determined and the Court of 
Appeals  had  affirmed  that  the  earlier  cases  alleging  perjury  and  abuse  of 
process did not state claims upon which relief could be granted. The behavior 
outlined in the Contempt Petitions simply is not the basis for causes of action 
cognizable in Shelby County Circuit Court. It is not likely that an attorney 
with Parrish’s years of experience and expertise could in good faith believe 
the claims in the Contempt Petitions were “warranted by existing law or by 
a  nonfrivolous  argument  for  the  extension,  modification,  or  reversal  of 
existing law or the establishment of new law.”

The lawsuit in its entirety and various pleadings in this case, even Parrish’s 
pleadings related to the Rule 11 motion, are spurious. 

. . .

In addition, Parrish asserted in his motion to dismiss Respondents’ motion 
for sanctions that his notice of nonsuit (which was filed after Respondents’
Rule 11 motion) rendered the Rule 11 motion nonjusticiable. Such a result 
would mean that attorneys could avoid Rule 11 sanctions by filing a notice 
of  nonsuit  of  the  underling  action  once  an  opposing  party  files  a  Rule  11 
motion.  Parrish  certainly  knew  or  should  have  known  his  pleading  was 
without merit. Parrish is an experienced lawyer who has been practicing law 
for  over  fifty  years[.] Parrish’s  client  did  not  prepare,  sign,  or  file  the 
pleadings and would not know whether the claims and representations made 
therein are warranted under Tennessee law. Pursuant to Rule 11.03(2)(a), the 
court  may  not  award  monetary  sanctions  against  a  represented  party  for  a 
violation of subdivision 11.02(2). Parrish violated Rule 11.02(2). The court, 
therefore, awards the sanctions directly against Parrish.

The  trial  court  found  that  the  Autins’  attorney  filed  an  affidavit  stating  that  the 
Autins  incurred  attorney’s  fees  of  more  than  $20,000.00  to  “address[]  the  blatantly 
frivolous  claims  in this  case.”    The  trial  court  assessed  monetary  sanctions  against  Mr. 
Parrish in the amount of $3,000.00, an amount “not so much as to be debilitating, but [] 
enough [to] meet the purpose of Rule 11.”  The trial court ordered Mr. Parrish to pay this 
amount to the Autins, through their legal counsel, within 30 days of entry of the order.

- 15 -

On May 3, 2022, Mr. Goetz filed a Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 59.04 motion 
to alter or amend the trial court’s order.  In his motion, Mr. Goetz asserted that the sanctions 
awarded by the trial court were “in an amount and against a person different from the May 
21, 2019 Rule 11 sanctions motion.”  Mr. Goetz asserted that “primary reasons” to alter or 
amend the judgment were those set forth in his May 2, 2022 application for permission to 
appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which were “attached as Exhibit A hereto and[]
incorporated herein by reference as if quoted here verbatim.”  Neither the application to 
the supreme court nor “Exhibit A” are included in the record transmitted to this Court.  

Mr.  Goetz also  stated  that  he  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  to  this  Court  on  March  29, 
2022, and that “[i]f the notice of appeal was  prematurely filed, how the COA wishes to 
remedy the problem is a call of the COA, not this [c]ourt. For instance, the 30-day appeal 
time could restart when this Rule 59.04 motion is decided. Or the current notice of appeal 
may be deemed sufficient. There are other options.”  He additionally submitted that “[t]he 
May  2,  2022  decision  by  this  [c]ourt,  in  the  respectful  opinion  of  plaintiff,  is  subject  to 
rescission for other reasons, but, because the above reasons are case-dispositive, there is 
no need to elongate this motion.”  The trial court denied the motion on June 8, 2022. 

Mr. Goetz filed a notice of appeal to this Court on June 21, 2022.  On July 7, he 
filed  a  motion  to  consolidate  the  appeal  with his  March  2022  appeal  of  the  trial  court’s 
order dismissing the case.  We granted the consolidation motion on July 19, 2022.  

Mr. Goetz raises the following issues for our review, as stated in his brief:

II.  ISSUES

1) When, on May 31, 2019, State, in strict accord with Tennessee Rules of 
Civil  Procedure,  Rule  41.01(1),  timely  filed  a  written  Notice  of  Partial 
Nonsuit when no motion for summary judgment was pending, did the trial 
court’s  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  then  and  there,  dissipate  negating  the 
authority of the trial court to further adjudicate the case, leaving the trial court 
only the authority to “sign” the ministerial order which Tennessee Rules of 
Civil Procedure, Rule 41.01(3) directs “must” follow a “voluntary nonsuit?”  

2) When, on May 31, 2019, State filed a written Notice of Partial Nonsuit, 
did the trial court reversibly err by refusing to “sign” the  ministerial order 
which Rule 41.01(3) directs “must” follow a “voluntary nonsuit?”

3) When appellant’s written Notice Of Partial Nonsuit was filed, on May 31, 
2019, did the filed notice effectuate a voluntary dismissal without prejudice 
of  the  entire  suit  or  merely  the  part  of  the  suit  stated  in  the  notice  to  be 
nonsuited?

- 16 -

4) After, on May 31, 2019, State’s Notice Of Partial Nonsuit was filed, are 
all proceedings conducted in the trial court coram non judice?

5) Presuming that no voluntary nonsuit was effectuated on May 31, 2019, did 
the  trial  court  reversibly  err  in  entering,  the  September  29,  2021  order 
dismissing the case, pursuant to Rule 12.02(6), for failure to state a claim and 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

6) Presuming that no voluntary nonsuit was effectuated on May 31, 2019, did 
the trial court reversibly err in imposition of monetary sanctions, pursuant to 
Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  11.03,  on  counsel  for  State  for 
initiating the case by the First Amended Petition.

(Citations to record omitted).

The Autins present the following issues, as stated in their brief:

1) Is Goetz acting on relation of the State of Tennessee, or as an individual 
person? 

2)  Did  Goetz’s  Notice  of  Partial  Nonsuit  Without  Prejudice  effectuate  a 
nonsuit of the First Amended Petition for Criminal Contempt? 

3)  Did  the  trial  court  commit  reversible  error  by  entering  the  Dismissal 
Order? 

4)  Did  the  trial  court  commit  reversible  error  by  entering  the  Sanctions 
Order? 

5) Is Goetz’s current appeal frivolous1 pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 27-1-
122?

The Autins specifically designate their prayer for sanctions on appeal as an issue for our 
consideration.  

III.   STANDARD OF REVIEW

A  trial  court’s  dismissal  of  a  lawsuit for  failure  to  state  a  claim  under  Tennessee 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(6) presents a question of law.  Elvis Presley Enter., Inc. v. 
City of Memphis, 620 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tenn. 2021) (citation omitted).   A trial court’s 
determination that the doctrine of res judicata bars a claim also involves a question of law, 
Regions Bank v. Prager, 625 S.W.3d 842, 848 (Tenn. 2021) (citations omitted), as does a 
- 17 -

trial  court’s  decision  regarding  the  issue  of  standing.  Metro.  Gov’t  of  Nashville  & 
Davidson Cnty. v. Tennessee Dep’t of Educ., 645 S.W.3d 141, 147 (Tenn. 2022) (citation 
omitted).  Our review of a trial court’s determinations on questions of law is de novo with 
no presumption of correctness.  Cooper v. Mandy, 639 S.W.3d 29, 33 (Tenn. 2022).

The Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure are promulgated by the Tennessee Supreme 
Court, approved by the General Assembly, and “have the force and effect of law.”  Hall v. 
Haynes, 915 S.W.3d 564, 571 (Tenn. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted in original) 
(quoting Frye  v.  Blue  Ridge  Neurosci.  Ctr.,  P.C., 70  S.W.3d  710,  713 (Tenn.  2002) 
(quoting  Crosslin  v.  Alsup, 594  S.W.2d  379,  380  (Tenn.  1980))).    Accordingly,  the 
interpretation  of  the  Rules  also  is  a  question  of  law  which  we  review de  novo with  no 
presumption of correctness for the determinations of the trial court.  Thomas v. Oldfield, 
279 S.W.3d 259, 261 (Tenn. 2009).  

IV.  ANALYSIS

We first address the statement in Mr. Goetz’s brief that: “This case must be viewed 
through the ‘eyes of the law’ and not by the eyes of humans, no matter whether the humans 
are ordinary citizens or judges.”  Mr. Goetz submits, “[i]f the human perspective is taken,
a  viewer  will  see  an  ongoing  dispute  between  three  private  parties,  i.e.,  Appellees [the 
Autins] and Defendant Goetz.  A human view will dictate a result that is very likely to be 
opposite of the law’s view.  This is the basis of the error about which generated this appeal.”  
We read this statement as a less eloquent reiteration of Aristotle’s famous dictate that, “The 
law is reason free from passion.”  We assure Mr. Goetz that, as is its usual practice, this 
Court will do its utmost to apply the law to the facts of this case without imposition of bias 
or prejudice.  Turning to that task, we first note Mr. Goetz’s contentions that  Appellees 
were “prosecuted by a relator (substitute district attorney), the identity of whom is totally 
irrelevant, as is the identity of the lawyer for the relator” and “there has never been a prior 
lawsuit between the State and Appellees[, and] . . . the facts at issue have never before been 
litigated.”  Furthermore, the cover of Mr. Goetz’s brief contains a footnote, stating:

The  Petition  which  initiated  this  case  was  and  remained  filed  pursuant 
Tennessee Code Annotated § 29-9-102 and § 29-9-105 initiating a case on 
relation of the State of Tennessee by William Goetz which, properly should 
have been styled “State of Tennessee ex rel. William Goetz v. Donel Autin 
And  Dana  Autin”  instead  of  mistakenly  styled  “William  Goetz  v. Donel 
Autin And Dana Autin.”

For the first time in his brief, Mr. Goetz refers to the Appellant in this matter as “the State.”  

The flaw in Mr. Goetz’s argument is that neither Mr. Goetz nor Mr. Parrish represent 
the  State  of  Tennessee.   Importantly, the  record  reflects  that  the  Shelby  County  District 
Attorney refused Messrs. Goetz and Parrish’s invitation to prosecute this matter. There is 
- 18 -

nothing to indicate that either Mr. Parrish or Mr. Goetz possessed any authority—actual, 
implied, or apparent—to represent or speak for the State of Tennessee in this matter.  

In Tennessee, a private attorney may prosecute a contempt action to enforce an order 
of  the  court.    Wilson  v.  Wilson,  984  S.W.2d  898,  903  (Tenn.  1998).    Such  action  is 
governed  by  Tennessee Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure 42(b).   From  our  review,  it  is  clear 
that, although styled as a petition for criminal contempt, Mr. Goetz’s March 2019 petition 
did not comply with Rule 42(b) and was not filed to enforce a court order.  Rather, Mr. 
Goetz’s March 2019 petition asserted a criminal action for “aggravated perjury in violation 
of  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  39-16-703(a),  a  Class  D  felony[.]” Despite 
Appellant’s contention that Mr. Parrish was serving as “substitute district attorney” in this 
“ex rel”  action,  neither  Wilson nor  the  other  cases  cited  by  Mr.  Goetz stand  for  the 
proposition that a private attorney prosecuting a contempt action is equivalent to a district 
attorney or deputy district attorney.  In fact, the Wilson court specifically stated: “private 
attorneys  prosecuting  criminal  contempt  actions  in  Tennessee  are  not  ordinarily  clothed 
with all the powers of a public prosecutor. Indeed, there is no hint in this appeal that the 
defendant’s attorney has been given the powers of the public prosecutor in pursuing these 
contempt actions.”  Id. at 904.   

Tennessee Code Annotated sections 8-7-401 and 8-6-106 are the two statutes that 
authorize  a  district  attorney  to  use  a  private  attorney  to  prosecute  a  matter.    State  v. 
Culbreath, 30 S.W.3d 309, 314 (Tenn. 2000).  Although section 8-7-401 permits the victim 
of a crime to employ private legal counsel, private counsel acts  “as co-counsel with the 
district attorney general or the district attorney general’s deputies in trying cases, with the
extent of participation of such privately employed counsel being at the discretion of the 
district attorney general.”  Tenn. Code. Ann. § 8-7-401(a) (emphasis added).  The section 
further requires the district attorney general or a deputy to make the “final and concluding 
argument[]”  in  the  matter.    Id. As  noted  above,  the  Shelby  County  District  Attorney 
explicitly declined to pursue this matter.  The statute also provides:

(b)(1) No private legal counsel employed as a special prosecutor pursuant to 
subsection (a) is permitted to participate in any criminal hearing, trial or other 
proceeding  unless  the  defendant  or  defendants  have  been  notified  and  the 
court  has  conducted  a  hearing  on  such  employment  as  provided  in 
subdivision (b)(2).

(2) At such hearing, the defendant or defendants have the right to be present 
and to raise and preserve any objections to the employment of such special 
prosecutor as provided by law. The court shall examine the private counsel 
to be employed and shall make a specific finding as to whether such person 
is or is not qualified under the law to serve as special prosecutor and as to 
whether such person has or does not have a conflict of interest as provided 
by law.

- 19 -

Tenn. Code Ann. § 8-7-401(b). 

Tennessee Code Annotated section 8-6-106 provides:

(a) In all cases where the interest of the state requires, in the judgment of the 
governor and attorney general and reporter, additional counsel to the attorney 
general and reporter or district attorney general, the governor shall employ 
such  counsel,  who  shall  be  paid  such  compensation  for  services  as  the 
governor, secretary of state, and attorney general and reporter may deem just, 
the  same  to  be  paid  out  of  any  money  in  the  treasury  not  otherwise 
appropriated,  upon  the  certificate  of  such  officers  certifying  the  amount  to 
the commissioner of finance and administration.

(b) Notwithstanding this section or any other law to the contrary, the attorney 
general and reporter or district attorney general shall inform the governor of, 
and consideration  shall  be  given  to,  whether  the  person  or  firm  to  be 
employed as additional counsel:

(1) To defend the state in any action is then serving as counsel for a party in 
any  action  by  that  party  against  the  state  and  whether  the  action,  if 
adjudicated  in  that  party's  favor,  is  likely  to  result  in  an  increase  in  state 
expenditures; or

(2) To prosecute any action on behalf of the state is then serving as counsel 
in defense of any action against the state.

It is clear that none of the statutory requisites were met in this case.  

Additionally,  even  if  we  assume,  arguendo,  that  a  private  citizen  has  standing  to 
prosecute an action in the name of the State of Tennessee—an assumption which we do 
not make—the amended complaint filed by Mr. Parrish as legal counsel for Mr. Goetz is 
styled  “WILLIAM  GOETZ,  Petitioner,  v.  DONEL  AUTIN  and  DANA  AUTIN, 
Respondents.”  Mr. Goetz did not seek leave of the court to amend his complaint at any 
time.  Mr. Goetz’s May 2019 pleading styled “Notice of Partial Nonsuit Without Prejudice” 
merely  deleted  certain  prayers  for  damages.    Even  assuming  that  Mr.  Goetz  pleading 
constituted a notice of dismissal within the meaning of Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure
41.01,  the  pleading he  filed  in  July  2019 did  not  change  the  nature  of  Mr.  Goetz’s 
complaint.  

Having determine the nature of Mr. Goetz’s March 14, 2019 complaint, we turn to 

our review of the trial court’s judgment.   

- 20 -

A.  The “Notice of Partial Nonsuit”

We  turn  next to  Mr.  Goetz’s  issues concerning his  May  2019  notice  of  partial 
nonsuit.    The  third  issue  presented,  as  we  restate  it,  is  whether  the  May  2019  filing  of 
“partial nonsuit” effectuated a voluntary dismissal of the entirety of his Mr. Goetz’s action.  

In the Argument section of his brief, Mr. Goetz makes no argument on this issue.  
Rather, he merely supplies excerpts from two unpublished opinions of this Court.  We may 
consider an issue waived when it is not addressed or developed in the argument section of 
the appellant’s brief.  Childress v. Union Realty Co., 97 S.W.3d 573, 578 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
2002).    Notwithstanding  the  insufficiency  of  Mr.  Goetz’s  argument  on  this  issue,  Mr.
Goetz’s May 2019 notice clearly sought a “partial” nonsuit.  Furthermore, the pleading he 
filed in July 2019 merely reiterated the actions asserted in his March 14, 2019 complaint,
but it abandoned his prayer for monetary damages.4  As such, this issue is without merit.  

We next turn to whether the May 2019 notice constituted a notice of nonsuit within 

the meaning of Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure provide 41.01, which provides:

(1) Subject to the provisions of Rule 23.05, Rule 23.06, or Rule 66 or of any 
statute, and except when a motion for summary judgment made by an adverse 
party is pending, the plaintiff shall have the right to take a voluntary nonsuit 
to dismiss an action without prejudice by filing a written notice of dismissal 
at any time before the trial of a cause and serving a copy of the notice upon 
all parties, and if a party has not already been served with a summons and 
complaint, the plaintiff shall also serve a copy of the complaint on that party; 
or  by  an  oral  notice  of  dismissal  made  in  open  court  during  the  trial  of  a 
cause; or in jury trials at any time before the jury retires to consider its verdict 
and prior to the ruling of the court sustaining a motion for a directed verdict. 
If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the service upon 
the  defendant  of  plaintiff's  motion  to  dismiss,  the  defendant  may  elect  to 
proceed on such counterclaim in the capacity of a plaintiff.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a notice of 
dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff 
who  has  twice  dismissed  in  any  court  an  action  based  on  or  including  the 
same claim.

(3) A  voluntary  nonsuit  to  dismiss  an  action  without  prejudice  must  be 
followed by an order of voluntary dismissal signed by the court and entered 
by  the  clerk.  The  date  of  entry  of  the  order  will  govern  the  running  of 

                                           
4Other than omitting prayers for monetary damages, Mr. Goetz’s July 2019 filing was identical to his March 
14, 2019 first amended complaint.

- 21 -

pertinent time periods.

Tenn. R. Civ. P. 41.01 (emphasis added).

As  the  trial  court  found,  Mr.  Goetz did  not  seek  dismissal  of  any  “action” in  his 
“notice  of  partial  nonsuit.”    For  the  purposes  of  the  Rule,  an  action  is  that  “which  is 
commenced with the filing of a complaint with the clerk of the court.”  Tenn. R. Civ. P. 3.  
In his May 2019 notice, Mr. Goetz only sought to delete certain claims for damages.  As 
such, the filing was not a Rule 41.01 notice of voluntary dismissal of the action.  Rather, it 
was an attempt to amend the March 14, 2019 complaint. Because Mr. Goetz’s May 2019 
notice was not a notice of dismissal within the meaning of Rule 41.01, the trial court did 
not err in declining to sign the notice, and the court retained jurisdiction over Mr. Goetz’s 
March 14, 2019 complaint.  The foregoing analysis also negates Mr. Goetz’s first, second, 
and fourth issues.

B. Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim and Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction

We turn next to the fifth issue presented by Mr. Goetz, which we restate as whether 
the trial court erred by dismissing his March 2019 complaint for failure to state a claim and 
for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

As this Court recently reiterated:

It  is  well-settled  that  a  Tennessee  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  Rule  12.02(6) 
motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim tests “‘only the legal sufficiency 
of the compliant, not the strength of the plaintiff’s proof or evidence.’”  Elvis 
Presley Enter., Inc. v. City of Memphis, 620 S.W.3d 318, 323 (Tenn. 2021) 
(quoting Webb v. Nashville Area Habitat for Humanity, Inc., 346 S.W.3d 
422, 426 (Tenn. 2011)). When considering a motion filed under the rule, the 
trial  court  must  determine  whether  the  allegations  of  the  complaint,  if 
considered true, constitute a cause of action as a matter of law.  Id. (citation 
omitted). “The resolution of a 12.02(6) motion to dismiss is determined by 
an examination of the pleadings alone.”  Webb. v. Nashville Area Habitat 
for Humanity, 346 S.W.3d 422, 426 (Tenn. 2011).

When  considering  a  motion  to  dismiss,  the  trial  court  “‘must  construe  the 
complaint  liberally,  presuming  all  factual  allegations  to  be  true  and  giving 
the  plaintiff  the  benefit  of  all  reasonable  inferences.’” Id. (quoting Tigg  v. 
Pirelli Tire Corp., 232 S.W.3d 28, 31-32 (Tenn. 2007) (quoting Trau-Med 
of  Am.,  Inc.  v.  Allstate  Ins.  Co.,  71  S.W.3d  691,  696  (Tenn.  2002))) 
(additional  citations  omitted).  It  should  grant  the  motion  “‘only  when  it 
appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that 
would entitle the plaintiff to relief.’” Id. (quoting Crews v. Buckman Labs. 
- 22 -

Int’l, Inc., 78 S.W.3d 852, 857 (Tenn. 2002)) (additional citations omitted). 
“A Rule 12.02(6) motion to dismiss admits the truth of all of the relevant and 
material  allegations  contained  in  the  complaint,  but  it  asserts  that  the 
allegations fail to establish a cause of action.” Leach v. Taylor, 124 S.W.3d 
87, 90 (Tenn. 2004).

McGinnis Oil Co. LLC v. Bowling, No. W2021-01104-COA-R3-CV, 2022 WL 15596054, 
at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2022).

As his argument on this issue, Mr. Goetz’s brief merely cites caselaw related to the 

foregoing standard, after which he surmises that:

Respectfully stated, the law presumes that the Statement of Facts will [be]
found by a jury to be true. So considered, it is unimaginable that State “can 
prove no set of facts” which would amount to the criminal contempt of court 
pled in the First Amended Petition.

As noted above, the State of Tennessee is not a party to this appeal.  As also noted 
above,  we  may  consider  an  issue  waived  when  it  is  not addressed  or  developed  in  the
argument section of the appellant’s brief.  Childress, 97 S.W.3d at 578.  For these reasons, 
the issue is without merit and is, otherwise, waived.  

C. Sanctions

We turn to the sixth issue raised by Mr. Goetz. We restate that issue as whether the 
trial court erred by imposing monetary sanctions on Mr. Parrish pursuant to the Tennessee 
Rule of Civil Procedure 11.03.

Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 11.02 provides:

By  presenting  to  the  court  (whether  by  signing,  filing,  submitting,  or  later 
advocating)  a  pleading,  written  motion,  or  other  paper,  an  attorney  or 
unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person’s knowledge, 
information,  and  belief,  formed  after  an  inquiry  reasonable  under  the 
circumstances—

(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to 
cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;

(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by 
existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, 
or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;

- 23 -

(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, 
if  specifically  so  identified,  are  likely  to  have  evidentiary  support  after  a 
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and

(4) the  denial  of  factual  contentions  are  warranted  on  the  evidence  or,  if 
specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or 
belief.

Rule 11.03 provides, in relevant part:

(2) Nature of Sanctions; Limitations. A sanction imposed for violation of 
this  rule  shall  be  limited  to  what  is  sufficient  to  deter  repetition  of  such 
conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. Subject to the 
limitations  in  subparagraphs  (a)  and  (b),  the  sanction  may  consist  of,  or 
include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty into 
court,  or,  if  imposed  on  motion  and  warranted  for  effective  deterrence,  an 
order  directing  payment  to  the  movant  of  some  or  all  of  the  reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.

(a) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented party for a 
violation of subdivision 11.02(2).

(b) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded on the court’s initiative unless 
the  court  issues  its  order  to  show  cause  before  a  voluntary  dismissal  or 
settlement  of  the  claims  made  by  or  against  the  party  which  is,  or  whose 
attorneys are, to be sanctioned.

(3)  Order. When  imposing sanctions,  the  court  shall  describe  the  conduct 
determined to constitute a violation of this rule and explain the basis for the 
sanction imposed.

Tenn. R. Civ. P. 11.02(2).

The Tennessee Supreme Court has observed that “[t]he certification which results 
from the attorney’s signature on a motion, pleading, or other document is directed at the 
three  substantive  prongs  of  Rule  11:  its  factual  basis,  its  legal  basis,  and  its  legitimate 
purpose.”  Andrews v. Bible, 812 S.W.2d 284, 287 (Tenn. 1991) (citations omitted).  The 
attorney’s “signature signifies to the Court that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or 
other paper, has conducted a reasonable inquiry into the facts and the law, and is satisfied 
that the document is well-grounded in both, and is acting without any improper motive.”  
Id. (citations omitted).  Under Rule 11, an attorney’s signature is not meaningless.  Rather, 
it signifies to the trial court that the document has merit.  Id. at 287-88 (citations omitted).  
The rule’s purpose “is to bring home to the individual signer his personal, nondelegable 
- 24 -

responsibility.”  Id. at 288.  The rule sends a message “‘to the attorney [] that this is not a 
team  effort  but  in  the  last  analysis, yours  alone[.]’”  Id. (quoting Pavelic  &  LeFlore  v. 
Marvel Entertainment Group, 493 U.S. 120, 110 S.Ct. 456, 460, 107 L. Ed.2d 438 (1989)) 
(emphasis in the original).  The main purpose of Rule 11 is to deter “abuse in the litigation 
process.”  Id. at 292.

This Court has noted that:

The  courts  are  to  apply  a  standard  of  “objective  reasonableness  under  the 
circumstances”  when  determining  whether  conduct  is  sanctionable  under 
Rule  11.    Hooker  v.  Sundquist, 107  S.W.3d  at  536  (citing Andrews, 812 
S.W.2d  at  288).  “Sanctions  are  appropriate  when  an  attorney  submits  a 
motion  or  other  paper  on  grounds  which  he  knows  or  should  know are 
without  merit,  and  a  showing  of  subjective  bad  faith  is  not  required.”    Id.
(quoting Boyd  v.  Prime  Focus,  Inc., 83  S.W.3d  761,  765  (Tenn. Ct. App.
2001)). However, when deciding whether to impose sanctions under Rule 11, 
the  trial  court  should  consider  all  the  circumstances. Id. “[T]he  trial  judge 
should  consider  not  only  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  violation,  but 
also  the  factors  bearing  on  the  reasonableness  of  the  conduct,  such  as
experience  and  past  performance  of  the  attorney,  as  well  as  the  general
standards of conduct of the bar of the court.” Andrews, 812 S.W.2d at 292 
n.4.

Brown v. Shappley, 290 S.W.3d 197, 202–03 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008).

We review a trial court’s ruling on a Rule 11 motion for sanctions for an abuse of 
discretion.  Id. at 200 (citation omitted).  “An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision 
of  the  lower  court  has  no  basis  in  law  or  fact  and  is  therefore  arbitrary,  illogical,  or 
unconscionable.”  Id. (citations omitted).  This deferential standard governs our review of 
this issue because “the question of whether a Rule 11 violation has occurred requires the 
trial court to make highly fact-intensive determinations regarding the reasonableness of the 
attorney’s conduct.”  Id. (citation omitted).   We review  the trial court’s factual findings 
with a presumption of correctness.  Id.; Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d).  

In his brief, Mr. Goetz contends that the sanctions awarded by the trial court were
“platformed on false presuppositions without which the (sic) is no basis in fact or law for 
the imposition of sanctions.”  He further asserts that “the capacity question is completely 
overlooked[]” and  that  “the  instant  criminal  contempt  civil  case  is  by  State  against 
Appellees.  Defendant Goetz has no capacity in the instant case other than as a substitute 
district attorney and, as a substitute district attorney, has never been a party to any prior 
case  where  Appellees  were  parties,  except  as  a  victim  of  the  fraud  described  in  the 
Statement  Of  Facts.”    Moreover,  Mr.  Goetz  submits  that  he never  “made  any  claim  for 
relief for perjury” and contends: 

- 25 -

Secondly, even if the eyes of the law legitimately could be blinded, there is 
not  a  scintilla  of  evidence  in  the  record  of  this  case  that  Defendant  Goetz 
sought any relief from Appellees for perjury and abuse of process claim are 
not the same as criminal contempt claims by a substitute district attorney.

Finally, Mr. Goetz asserts:

The Sanctions Order includes the following: “Such a result would mean that 
attorneys could avoid Rule 11 sanctions by filing a notice of nonsuit of the 
underlying  action  once  an  opposing  party  files  a  Rule  11  motion.  Parrish 
certainly knew or should have known his pleading was without merit.” 

At the time of the Notice Of Partial Nonsuit, the motion for sanctions had 
only  been  filed  for  10  days.  There  was  no  order  reserving  anything,  much 
less reserving a ruling on the sanctions motion. However, had there been such 
an order, the order was would have been totally neutral, i.e., as likely to have 
rule  one  way  as  the  other.  As  to  the  effect  of  a  notice  of  nonsuit  on  all 
interlocutory orders, before or after the notice of nonsuit. 

With  due  respect,  the  Sanctions  Order  is  stated  in  words that  essentially 
castigate counsel for State’s relator without any just cause. The castigation 
loses sight of what is in the record and how the “eyes of the law” view the 
representation of counsel.

(Citations to record omitted).

As noted above, the State of Tennessee is not a party to this action, and Mr. Goetz’s 
“notice  of  partial  nonsuit”  was  not  effective  to  transform  his  March  14,  2019  civil 
complaint into a criminal action asserted by the State on Mr. Goetz’s behalf.  Furthermore, 
it  is  well-settled  that  Tennessee  does  not  recognize  a  civil  action  for  perjury  or  for 
conspiracy  to  commit  perjury.    Felts  v.  Paradise,  158  S.W.2d  727,  728  (Tenn.  1942) 
(holding: “It is the well-settled law that an action at law will not lie to recover damages for 
perjury alleged to have been committed in a former case in which the plaintiff might have 
been interested.); Whitaker v. Whirlpool Corp., 32 S.W.3d 222, 231 (Tenn. Ct. App 2000),
perm. app. denied (Tenn. Sept. 25, 2000); Lacky v. Carson, 886 S.W.2d 232, 232 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. 1994), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Sept. 6, 1994); Medlock v. Ferrari, 602 S.W.2d 
241, 245 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1979), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Nov. 13, 1979).  

As previously discussed, the record reflects that the issue of the Autins’ veracity has 
been asserted by Mr. Goetz many times throughout the protracted history of the case.  From 
the  record,  the  totality  of  the  circumstance,  and  in  view  of Mr.  Parrish’s  extensive 
experience  as  a  member  of  the  Bar,  we  conclude  that  the  trial  court  did  not abuse its
- 26 -

discretion by imposing sanctions against Mr. Parrish.  

D. Sanctions on Appeal

We turn to the Autins’ request for sanctions on appeal pursuant to Tennessee Code 

Annotated section 27-1-122, which provides:

When  it  appears  to  any  reviewing  court  that  the  appeal  from  any  court  of 
record  was  frivolous  or  taken  solely  for  delay,  the  court  may,  either  upon 
motion  of  a  party  or  of  its  own  motion,  award  just  damages  against  the 
appellant, which may include, but need not be limited to, costs, interest on
the judgment, and expenses incurred by the appellee as a result of the appeal.

The purpose of section 27-1-122 is “to discourage groundless appeals and to redress 
the  harm  imposed  upon  harassed  appellees.”    Collins  v.  Willis,  No.  01A01-9808-CH-
00433, 1999 WL 298261, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 13, 1999) (citing see Davis v. Gulf 
Ins. Group, 546 S.W.2d 583, 586 (Tenn. 1977)).  An award of damages under the section, 
including attorney’s fees,  “rests in the appellate court’s sound discretion.”  Eberbach  v. 
Eberbach,  535  S.W.3d  467,  475  (Tenn.  2017).   However,  “[w]e  exercise  our  discretion 
under  the  statute  sparingly  so  as  not  to  discourage  legitimate  appeals.”    Whalum  v. 
Marshall, 224 S.W.3d 169, 181 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006).

We have observed that “‘[s]uccessful litigants should not have to bear the expense 
and vexation of groundless appeals.’”  Id. (quoting Davis v. Gulf Ins. Group, 546 S.W.2d 
583,  586  (Tenn. 1977).  A  frivolous  appeal  is  one  that  has  “‘no  reasonable  chance  of 
success.’”  Id. (quoting Jackson v. Aldridge, 6 S.W.3d 501, 504 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999).
An appeal may also be considered frivolous if it is “‘so utterly devoid of merit as to justify 
the  imposition  of  a  penalty[.]’” Id. (quoting Combustion  Eng’g,  Inc.  v.  Kennedy, 562 
S.W.2d 202, 205 (Tenn. 1978)).  

Mr. Goetz has challenged the Autins’ veracity for more than a decade, through at 
least half a dozen trial court actions and four prior appeals.  As the trial court noted, the 
attorney’s fees in this dispute are staggering.  The style of Mr. Goetz’s complaints and his 
motions have become increasingly contrived, yet substantial resources have been expended
to address his duplicative and spurious filings.  The arguments espoused by Mr. Goetz and 
his attorney in the instant appeal are merely the latest of their many quixotic windmills.
For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the instant appeal is so devoid of merit 
that an award of sanctions against Mr. Goetz pursuant to section 27-1-122 is appropriate. 
Accordingly,  the  case  is remanded  to  the  trial  court  for  determination  of  the  Autins’ 
reasonable  damages  incurred  on  appeal, including  their  costs  and  reasonable  attorney’s 
fees,  and  for  entry  of  judgment  on  same. Any  issues  or  arguments  not  specifically 
addressed in this opinion are pretermitted as unnecessary in view of our disposition of this 
matter.

IV.  CONCLUSION

The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.  The Autins’ request for frivolous appeal 
damages is granted, and the case is remanded to the trial court for determination of such 
damages, entry of judgment on same, and for such further proceedings as may be necessary 
and are consistent with this opinion.  Costs on appeal are taxed to the appellant, William 
Goetz, for which execution may issue if necessary.
