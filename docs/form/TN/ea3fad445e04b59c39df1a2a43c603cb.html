      <pre>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE 
AT JACKSON 
April 5, 2022 Session 
 
STATE OF TENNESSEE v. QUINTON DEVON PERRY 
 
Appeal by Permission from the Court of Criminal Appeals 
Circuit Court for Madison County 
No. 18-502  Donald H. Allen, Judge 
___________________________________ 
 
No. W2019-01553-SC-R11-CD 
__________________________________ 
 
In this appeal, we address principles governing the imposition of consecutive sentencing 
for “an offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-
35-115(b)(2)  (2019).    Quinton  Devon  Perry  pleaded  guilty  to  twenty-four  counts  of 
aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor that took place during the years 2016 and 2017, 
stemming from the discovery that he had uploaded 174 images or videos comprising child 
pornography or child erotica to his electronic file sharing account.  Although Mr. Perry had 
no prior criminal convictions, the trial court imposed partial consecutive sentencing after 
finding that he qualified as an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive.  A 
divided  panel  of  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  affirmed.    State  v.  Perry,  No.  W2019-
01553-CCA-R3-CD, 2021 WL 2563039, at *7 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 22, 2021), perm. 
app. granted, (Tenn. Nov. 18, 2021).  The dissenting judge, citing a lack of proof that Mr. 
Perry engaged in  a continuous course  of downloading and uploading  materials over the 
alleged time period, concluded that the record did not establish him as an offender whose 
record of criminal activity  was extensive.  Id. at *6–7 (McMullen,  J., dissenting).1  Mr. 
Perry sought permission to appeal, arguing that the lower courts improperly found him to 
be an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive based solely on the number 
of offenses to which he pleaded guilty.  We accepted Mr. Perry’s appeal.  In this opinion, 
we clarify certain principles for imposing consecutive sentencing under Tennessee Code 
Annotated section 40-35-115(b)(2) and set forth a non-exclusive list of considerations to 
aid  determining  whether  a  defendant  qualifies  as  an  offender  whose  record  of  criminal 
activity  is  extensive.    Based  on  our  review,  we  have  determined  that  the  trial  court 
adequately  articulated  the  reasons  for  ordering  consecutive  sentencing  on  the  record.  
Affording the trial court’s decision a presumption of reasonableness, we conclude that the 
trial court did not err in imposing partial consecutive sentencing.  Accordingly, we affirm 
the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

                                              

1  Judge  McMullen  authored  the  majority  opinion.    In  that  opinion,  however,  Judge  McMullen 
disagreed with the majority as to the trial court’s decision to impose partial consecutive sentencing.  For 
purposes of our opinion, we have characterized Judge McMullen’s view of the issue as a dissent.

OPINION 
 
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

n August 2017, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children notified 
the  Jackson  Police  Department  of  a  tip  it  had  received  from  the  electronic  file  sharing 
service Dropbox, Inc.  The tip indicated that a Dropbox user had uploaded to his Dropbox 
account 174 electronic files believed to be child pornography or child erotica.  The Jackson 
Police  Department  investigated  and  confirmed  that  the  uploaded  files  consisted  of  still 
images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexual activity or posed in a sexual manner.  
Further police investigation led authorities to Quinton Devon Perry (“the Defendant”).  In 
February 2018, police investigators interviewed the Defendant.2  The Defendant initially 
denied  responsibility  but  ultimately  admitted  that  he  had  downloaded  the  images  and 
videos  and  uploaded  the  files  to  his  Dropbox  account  using  his  mobile  phone.    The 
Defendant also admitted that he had shared or traded electronic files with others. 

he  Defendant  was  indicted  in  July  2018  on  twenty-four  counts  of  aggravated 

sexual exploitation of a minor.  The first six counts alleged that the Defendant 

id  knowingly  promote,  sell,  distribute,  transport,  purchase,  or  exchange 
material,  or  possess  with  the  intent  to  promote,  sell,  distribute,  transport, 
purchase, or exchange material, which includes a minor engaged in sexual

2  The  Defendant’s  statement  to  police  was  the  subject  of  a  motion  to  suppress.    The  record 
demonstrates that the trial court denied the motion to suppress.  However, the record does not contain the 
transcript of the suppression hearing, and as a result, it does not detail the evidence offered at the hearing.

activity or simulated sexual activity that is patently offensive and where the 
number of materials involved is greater than twenty-five (25). 
 

See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-1004(a)(2) (2018).3  Because the first six counts specified 
that the number of materials involved was greater than twenty-five, they were classified as 
Class  B  felonies.4    See  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  § 39-17-1004(a)(4).    The  remaining  eighteen 
counts contained the same factual allegation except that they each corresponded to a single 
item of material, and as such, they were classified as Class C felonies.  See id.  By indicting 
the Defendant in this manner, the State maximized the number of Class B felony counts 
and remaining Class C felony counts, given that there were a total of 174 images or videos.  
Each count of the indictment alleged that the unlawful activity occurred “on or about 2016 
through 2017.” 
 

In June 2019, the Defendant pleaded guilty to all twenty-four counts.  At the guilty 
plea hearing, the State recounted the facts described above to establish the factual basis for 
the offenses.  In addition, the State identified a particular Internet Protocol address (“IP 
address”)5 from which the Defendant had uploaded the 174 electronic files to his Dropbox 
account.  In describing the Defendant’s statement to police, the State recounted: 

The  Defendant]  stated  that  he  has  a  problem  where  he  enjoys  looking  at 
young girls/children for sexual pleasure.  He informed [t]he investigators that 
he  downloaded  images  and  videos  of  children  committing  sexual  acts  to 
another person and/or touching their naked bodies in a sexual manner.  He 
informed  investigators  that  he  uploaded  this  child  pornography  to  his 
Dropbox account and shared or traded the images and videos electronically 
with  other  people.    He  did  advise  that  he  downloaded  and  uploaded  this 
pornography  while  he  was  residing  at  his  grandparents’  house  here  in 
Madison County . . . and it took place during the years 2016 and 2017. 
 

The Defendant agreed that he had committed the offenses as described by the State. 

he  Defendant  entered  an  open  or  blind  guilty  plea,  meaning  that  he  had  no 
sentencing agreement with the State.  The State filed a motion requesting that the trial court 
impose consecutive sentences, arguing that the Defendant was an offender whose record 

                                              

3 Because the pertinent statutory language has not changed since the commission of the Defendant’s 

offenses, we cite to the current version of the code. 

 Tennessee law specifies that “[w]here the number of materials involved in a violation . . . is greater 
than twenty-five (25), the person may be charged in a single count to enhance the class of offense [from a 
Class C felony to a Class B felony].”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-1004(a)(2).

of criminal activity was extensive.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-115(b)(2) (2019).  The 
trial court conducted a sentencing hearing in July 2019, at which the State introduced a 
presentence report that contained background information about the Defendant as well as 
details concerning the offenses. 

he  presentence  report  revealed  that  the  Defendant  was  born  in  January  1997, 
making  him  nineteen  to  twenty  years  old  at  the  time  of  the  offenses.    He  had  no  prior 
criminal  convictions.    However,  the  Defendant  reported  that  he  used  marijuana 
“occasionally” from age fifteen through twenty.  Similarly, the Defendant admitted that he 
drank alcohol “on occasion” beginning at age seventeen.  The Defendant graduated high 
school  in  May  2016  and  lived  in  Jackson  with  his  grandparents  during  2016  and  2017 
before  moving  to  nearby  Hardeman  County.    He  began  working  at  age  thirteen  and 
continued to work, in a variety of jobs, through his arrest.  The Defendant was evaluated 
through  the  use  of  an  assessment  tool  that  gauged  the  general  likelihood  to  re-offend, 
yielding the result of a low risk. 

s for the circumstances surrounding the  offenses, the report recounted the facts 
described  above,  but  it  provided  some  additional  details.    The  report  revealed  that  law 
enforcement authorities, through subpoenas, attempted to obtain information about the IP 
address used to complete the “uploads” to the Defendant’s Dropbox account, “using a time 
frame five days prior and five days after the date and time of the reported uploads.”  In 
other  words,  the  report’s  references  to  uploads—plural—suggested  that  the  Defendant 
uploaded  files  to  his  Dropbox  account  on  more  than  one  occasion.    Additionally,  law 
enforcement authorities obtained information that “mobile devices . . . had been used to 
log into the Dropbox account” and “four additional IP addresses . . . had been used to log 
into the account.”  In other words, consistent with the factual basis from the guilty plea 
hearing, the report suggested that the Defendant had allowed others to access his Dropbox 
account.  Lastly, the report indicated that the 174 images and videos did not involve a single 
minor and sex act, but instead involved multiple different minors and multiple sex acts. 

or his part, the Defendant offered his own testimony and that of his mother.  The 
Defendant emphasized that he had no prior criminal convictions.  He also testified that he 
was amenable to receiving professional help for his behavior.  His mother confirmed that 
he had never been in trouble previously and had been a good member of the family. 

fter the presentation of proof, the State acknowledged that the Defendant had no 
prior  criminal  convictions  but  argued  that  precedent  indicated  he  could  qualify  as  “an 
offender  whose  record  of  criminal  activity  is  extensive,”  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  § 40-35-
115(b)(2), based on the convictions presently before the trial court.  The State asked that 
two  of  the  B  felony  counts  be  run  consecutively,  with  the  remaining  counts  running 
concurrently.  To support its request, the State pointed, in general terms, to the number of 
offenses involved (twenty-four felonies), the particular facts making up the offenses, and 
the circumstances detailed in the presentence report.

n addressing the question of consecutive sentencing, the Defendant acknowledged 
that he would have to serve time in prison given the nature of his convictions6 but requested 
that  the  trial  court  order  the  sentences  for  his  multiple  offenses  to  run  concurrently.  
Recognizing the seriousness of the offenses, the Defendant admitted that “the images . . . 
are very graphic and . . . disturbing.”  Nevertheless, the Defendant pointed out that although 
he  “viewed  them”  and  “clearly  shared  them,”  he  had  not  produced  the  images.  
Furthermore,  he  argued  that  he  had  accepted  responsibility  for  the  offenses  and  was 
“agreeable to receiving  help.”    Noting  his  youth  and  the  fact  that  he  was  a  high  school 
graduate, the Defendant contended that he had “a lot of potential still” and argued that he 
could “contribute to the community.” 

n setting the Defendant’s sentence at the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court 
articulated on the record the substantive sources for its decision.  More specifically, the 
trial court announced that it would consider the evidence that was presented at the guilty 
plea  hearing  and  at  the  sentencing  hearing,  including  the  presentence  report.7    The  trial 
court also announced that it was considering “the principles of sentencing” as well as “the 
arguments  that  have  been  made  by  counsel.”    In  addition,  the  trial  court  made  specific 
reference to statutory enhancement and mitigating factors. 

he trial court articulated the facts and circumstances that it found to be generally 
relevant  to  the  sentencing  decision.    More  specifically,  the  trial  court  observed  that  the 
Defendant had pleaded guilty to twenty-four separate offenses.  The trial court recognized 
that the time period of the offenses was “in 2016 and 2017.”  Additionally, the trial court 
stated  that  it  was  considering  “the  nature  and  characteristics  of  the  criminal  conduct 
involved.”  In that vein, the trial court noted that “it was a total of 174 images or files” that 
comprised  the  offenses,  commenting  that  “it  involved  a  large  amount  of  child 
pornography,” that the Defendant “downloaded numerous child pornographic videos,” and 
that the Defendant had engaged in “an extensive amount of criminal activity.”  Relatedly, 
the trial court took specific note of the proof that the Defendant “stated to investigators that 
he  has  a  problem  because  he  enjoys  looking  at  young  girls  . . .  for  sexual  pleasure.”  
Moreover, the trial court commented that “this isn’t just a situation where [the Defendant] 
downloaded pornographic material/child pornography which he maintained and viewed for 
his own pleasure.  Apparently he was sharing some of this or trading some of these images 
and videos with other individuals.”  As a result, the trial court stated that it considered this 

                                              

6  The  parties  agreed  at  the  guilty  plea  hearing  that  there  was  no  release  eligibility  for  the 
Defendant’s Class B felony convictions.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-501(i) (requiring 100% service, 
less sentence credits amounting to no more than 15%, of a sentence for the offense of aggravated sexual 
exploitation of a minor involving more than twenty-five images). 

 The trial court obviously was aware of the proof adduced at the suppression hearing, but the trial 

court’s findings at the sentencing hearing did not refer specifically to such evidence.

“a  serious  offense  especially  in  light  of  the  large  amount,  the  quantity  of  pornographic 
material which he was found to be in possession of.” 

he trial court acknowledged the Defendant’s lack of prior criminal convictions but 
did  note  the  Defendant’s  prior  “criminal  behavior”  in  the  form  of  marijuana  usage  and 
underage  alcohol  consumption.    In  addition,  the  trial  court  acknowledged  that  the 
Defendant  had  pleaded  guilty  and  accepted  responsibility  for  his  criminal  behavior.  
Relatedly,  the  trial  court  announced  that  it  considered  the  Defendant’s  potential  for 
treatment and rehabilitation.  The trial court also recognized the Defendant’s youth, both 
in  its  general  considerations  and  later  in  specific  findings  with  respect  to  statutory 
mitigating factors. 

aving identified these general considerations, the  trial court  addressed statutory 
enhancement and mitigating factors.  The trial court found that the evidence supported two 
enhancement factors: (1) that the Defendant had a previous history of criminal behavior in 
addition to that necessary to establish the appropriate sentencing range, and (2) that the 
Defendant was a leader in the commission of an offense involving two or more criminal 
actors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-114(1), (2) (2019).  As to the latter, the trial court 
reiterated  the  significance  of  sharing  the  pornographic  materials  with  other  individuals, 
stating that the Defendant was “committing another act of advancing child pornography” 
by “turn[ing] around and shar[ing] it with other people.”  With respect to mitigating factors, 
the  trial  court  found  that  the  Defendant’s  conduct  neither  caused  nor  threatened  serious 
bodily injury, referenced the Defendant’s youth, and noted that the Defendant had accepted 
responsibility for his crimes.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-113(1), (6), (13) (2019). 

he applicable sentencing range for the Defendant’s Class B felonies was eight to 
twelve years.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-112(a)(2).  The applicable sentencing range 
for the Defendant’s Class C felonies was three to six years.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-
112(a)(3).  The trial court sentenced the Defendant to nine years of imprisonment for each 
of  the  six  Class  B  felonies  (counts  one  through  six)  and  to  four  years  for  each  of  the 
eighteen Class C felonies (counts seven through twenty-four).  In addition, among other 
conditions, the trial court recommended that the Defendant be considered for a sex offender 
rehabilitative treatment program while in custody. 

aving determined the sentence on each count, the trial court turned to the question 
of  consecutive  sentencing.    The  trial  court  expressly  reiterated  its  consideration  of  the 
presentence  report.    The  trial  court  also  reiterated  its  consideration  of  the  facts  and 
circumstances  surrounding  the  offenses,  making  particular  mention  of  the  Defendant’s 
admitted “serious child pornography problem” and the large number of images involved, 
giving great weight to that circumstance.  Lastly, the trial court reiterated its consideration 
of “the fact that [the Defendant] not only possessed these [files], but apparently he shared 
and traded a lot of these child pornography  videos and pictures with other individuals.”  
Relying on the “number of convictions and the number of offenses he’s committed and the

number of offenses he’s pled guilty to,” the trial court found that the Defendant was as an 
“offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive.”  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-
115(b)(2).  The trial court then ordered counts one through three to be served concurrently 
as  a  group,  but  consecutively  to  counts  four  through  twenty-four,  for  an  effective  total 
sentence of eighteen years of imprisonment.  The trial court specifically found “that the 
aggregate  length  of  this  [eighteen-]year  sentence  reasonably  relates  to  the  number  of 
offenses for which the defendant stands convicted.” 

n  direct  appeal,  the  Defendant  challenged  both  the  length  of  the  individual 
sentences for his offenses and the trial court’s decision to impose consecutive sentencing.  
As to the length of the individual sentences, the Court of Criminal Appeals noted that “the 
record shows the trial court carefully considered the evidence, the statutory enhancement 
and  mitigating  factors,  and  the  purposes  and  principles  of  sentencing  when  imposing 
sentence” and concluded that “the trial court did not  wholly  depart from the  sentencing 
act.”    State  v.  Perry,  No.  W2019-01553-CCA-R3-CD,  2021  WL  2563039,  at  *7  (Tenn. 
Crim. App. June 22, 2021), perm. app. granted, (Tenn. Nov. 18, 2021).  Accordingly, the 
Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously affirmed the length of the individual sentences.  
Id.  

ith respect to the imposition of consecutive sentencing, however, the intermediate 
appellate  court  was  divided.    The  majority  “[did]  not  believe  the  trial  court  abused  its 
discretion in determining that the Defendant had a record of extensive criminal history” 
and affirmed the imposition of consecutive sentencing.  Id.  Judge Camille R. McMullen 
dissented.    In  Judge  McMullen’s  view,  “[t]he  record  shows  the  trial  court  justified 
consecutive  sentencing  based  solely  upon  the  number  of  convictions  to  which  the 
Defendant pleaded guilty without consideration of the pervasiveness of the Defendant’s 
illegal behavior.”  Id. at 6 (McMullen, J., dissenting).  Judge McMullen further stated: 

here is no question that the Defendant knowingly transferred or exchanged 
174 images of child pornography as charged in the multiple count indictment.  
While this conduct was repulsive and repugnant, there was no proof in the 
record that the Defendant engaged in a continuous course of downloading or 
uploading the materials for the year long period alleged in each of the twenty-
four  counts  of  the  indictment.    In  other  words,  the  Defendant  could  have 
engaged in a single electronic transfer to facilitate the download/upload of 
all 174 images of child pornography. 
 

Id.    Accordingly,  Judge  McMullen  concluded  that  the  record  did  not  establish  that  the 
Defendant had an extensive record of criminal activity.  Id. at 7. 
 

The Defendant appealed to this Court solely with regard to the issue of consecutive 
sentencing.    The  Defendant  contends  that  the  trial  court  erred  by  finding  an  extensive 
record  of  criminal  activity  based  solely  on  the  number  of  convictions.    Likewise,  the

Defendant contends that the Court of Criminal Appeals erred when it “impliedly found that 
the number of convictions, by itself, can support a finding of extensive criminal history.”  
From  our  review  of  the  record,  we  have  determined  that  the  trial  court  did  not  base  its 
finding that the Defendant was an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive 
solely  on  the  number  of  convictions.    Furthermore,  we  conclude  that  although  the  trial 
court’s treatment of the relevant considerations could have exhibited more depth, the record 
reflects  that  the  trial  court  sufficiently  articulated  its  reasons  for  ordering  consecutive 
sentences in accordance with the purposes and principles of sentencing such that the abuse 
of discretion standard, with a presumption of reasonableness, applies on appeal.  See State 
v. Pollard, 432 S.W.3d 851, 861–62 (Tenn. 2013).  Applying that standard, we conclude 
that the trial court did not err in imposing partial consecutive sentencing.  Accordingly, we 
affirm the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals. 
 

II. ANALYSIS 

 

Tennessee law provides that “[i]f the defendant pleads guilty or is convicted in one 
trial of more than one offense, the trial judge shall determine whether the sentences will be 
served concurrently or consecutively.”  Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1); see also Tenn. Code 
Ann. § 40-35-115(a).  Tennessee law further provides that consecutive sentencing, apart 
from certain instances in which it is mandatory, may be imposed by the trial court only 
under specified circumstances.  Those circumstances principally include when: 

The defendant is a professional criminal who has knowingly devoted 
the defendant’s life to criminal acts as a major source of livelihood; 
The  defendant  is  an  offender  whose  record  of  criminal  activity  is 
extensive; 
The defendant is a dangerous mentally abnormal person so declared 
by  a  competent  psychiatrist  who  concludes  as  a  result  of  an 
investigation prior to sentencing that the defendant’s criminal conduct 
has  been  characterized  by  a  pattern  of  repetitive  or  compulsive 
behavior with heedless indifference to consequences; 
The defendant is a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates little 
or  no  regard  for  human  life  and  no  hesitation  about  committing  a 
crime in which the risk to human life is high; 
The  defendant  is  convicted  of  two  (2)  or  more  statutory  offenses 
involving  sexual  abuse  of  a  minor  with  consideration  of  the 
aggravating circumstances arising from the relationship between the 
defendant  and  victim  or  victims,  the  time  span  of  defendant’s 
undetected sexual activity, the nature and scope of the sexual acts and 
the extent of the residual, physical and mental damage to the victim 
or victims; 
The  defendant  is  sentenced  for  an  offense  committed  while  on 
probation; or

Tenn.  Code  Ann.  § 40-35-115(b).8    To  impose  consecutive  sentencing  under  Tennessee 
Code Annotated section 40-35-115, the trial court must find that the proof establishes at 
least one of the seven listed classifications by a preponderance of the evidence.  Id.  Even 
when the proof establishes one of the classifications, the trial court is afforded discretion 
in deciding whether and to what degree to impose consecutive sentencing.  See id. (stating 
that the trial court, upon finding that the defendant is eligible for consecutive sentencing, 
“may order sentences to run consecutively”); see also State v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 370, 
392  (Tenn.  2011)  (recognizing  that  whether  sentences  are  to  be  served  concurrently  or 
consecutively is primarily within the discretion of the trial court); In re Sneed, 302 S.W.3d 
825, 829 (Tenn. 2010) (recognizing that the decision to impose consecutive sentencing is 
a “matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the sentencing court”). 
 

Some  of  the  classifications  set  forth  in  section  40-35-115  are  relatively 
straightforward  to  determine.    See,  e.g.,  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  § 40-35-115(b)(6)  (“The 
defendant is sentenced for an offense committed while on probation.”), 40-35-115(b)(7) 
(“The defendant is sentenced for criminal contempt.”).  Others, however, are less so.  See, 
e.g., Pollard, 432 S.W.3d at 863 (recognizing the more “subjective” nature of the dangerous 
offender classification under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b)(4)).  In this 
appeal, we address one of the latter classifications, section 40-35-115(b)(2), and we take 
this opportunity to set forth relevant considerations for determining whether a defendant 
qualifies for consecutive sentencing as “an offender whose record of criminal activity is 
extensive.” 

A. Standard of Review 

n recent years, this Court has examined criminal sentencing procedure in the wake 
of landmark decisions from the United States Supreme Court and corresponding legislative 
changes enacted by the Tennessee General Assembly.   See generally  State v.  Bise,  380 
S.W.3d 682, 693–99 (Tenn. 2012); Pollard, 432 S.W.3d at 856–62.  We will not repeat in 
this opinion the comprehensive examinations in Bise and Pollard of the developments in 
caselaw and legislation.  For purposes of this appeal, suffice it to say that one result of our 
prior  examinations  has  been  the  clarification  of  the  standard  of  review  for  sentencing 
decisions under the Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, as amended (“the 
Sentencing Act”).  In Bise, we addressed the principles governing appellate review of the 
trial court’s decision setting the length of sentence for an individual conviction.  Bise, 380 
S.W.3d  at  684.    We  adopted  “an  abuse  of  discretion  standard  of  review,  granting  a 
presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflect a proper 

                                              

8 Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b) was amended in 2021.  Act of May 4, 2021, ch. 
500, § 15, 2021 Tenn. Pub. Acts 1570, 1572 (codified at Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-115(b) (Supp. 2021) 
(adding subsection -115(b)(8))).  We refer to the version in effect at the time of the Defendant’s sentencing.

application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.”  Id. at 707.  We followed 
suit in Pollard with respect to the principles governing appellate review of the trial court’s 
decision to impose consecutive sentencing.  Pollard, 432 S.W.3d at 853.  Analogous to our 
holding in Bise, we announced that “the abuse of discretion standard, accompanied by a 
presumption of reasonableness, applies to consecutive sentencing determinations.”  Id. at 
860.  In each instance, we recognized that “the trial court must be afforded broad discretion 
in its sentencing decisions.”  Id. at 861.  As we stated in Bise, “trial courts, ‘familiar with 
their  locale  and  having  seen  the  evidence  and  the  defendant,  as  well  as  possessing  the 
benefit  of  experience  in  sentencing  matters,  should  retain  that  discretion  necessary  to 
achieve all of the purposes of the [Sentencing] Act.’”  380 S.W.3d at 709 (alteration in 
original) (quoting State v. Moss, 727 S.W.2d 229, 237 (Tenn. 1986)). 

owever,  we  also  noted  in  Bise  that  “appellate  courts  cannot  properly  review  a 
sentence  if  the  trial  court  fails  to  articulate  in  the  record  its  reasons  for  imposing  the 
sentence.”   Bise, 380  S.W.3d at  705–06 n.41 (citing Tenn.  Code  Ann. § 40-35-210(e)).  
“[O]ur  ruling  in  Bise  specifically  requires  trial  courts  to  articulate  the  reasons  for  the 
sentence in accordance with the purposes and principles of sentencing in order for the abuse 
of discretion standard with a presumption of reasonableness to apply on appeal.”  Pollard, 
432 S.W.3d at 861 (citing Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 698–99).  In Pollard, we emphasized the 
following principle: 

In  the  context  of  consecutive  sentencing,  the  presumption  of 
reasonableness applies similarly [to the reasoning in Bise], giving deference 
to  the  trial  court’s  exercise  of  its  discretionary  authority  to  impose 
consecutive sentences if it has provided reasons on the record establishing as 
least one of the seven grounds listed in Tennessee Code Annotated section 
40-35-115(b). 
 

Pollard, 432 S.W.3d at 861; see also Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1) (stating that in ordering 
consecutive sentencing, the trial court “shall specify the reasons for this decision”). 

lthough  we  repeatedly  have  stressed  the  importance  of  placing  findings  on  the 
record, we also have recognized that there is no requirement that the trial court’s reasoning 
be “particularly lengthy or detailed.”  Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706.  In Bise, we quoted with 
approval the United States Supreme Court’s guidance that the trial court simply must “set 
forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties’ arguments 
and  has  a  reasoned  basis  for  exercising  his  own  legal  decisionmaking  authority.”    Id. 
(quoting Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 356–57 (2007)).  Of course, we also have 
remarked  that,  on  a  practical  level,  “less  comprehensive  findings  may  require  appellate 
courts  to  more  carefully  review  the  record.”    Bise,  380  S.W.3d  at  706.    On  appeal,  the 
burden of showing that a sentence is improper is on the appealing party.  Tenn. Code Ann. 
§ 40-35-401(d)  (Sentencing  Commission  Comments);  see  also  State  v.  Dickson,  413 
S.W.3d 735, 748 (Tenn. 2013).

s we stated above, in the context of consecutive sentencing, the Sentencing Act 
provides that as a prerequisite to imposing consecutive sentences under section 40-35-115, 
the trial court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant qualifies for 
consecutive sentencing under one of the classifications set forth in section 40-35-115(b).9  
Only upon determining that the defendant meets the criteria for one of the classifications 
in section 40-35-115(b) does the trial court then choose whether, and to what degree, to 
impose consecutive sentencing based on the facts and circumstances of the case, bearing 
in mind the purposes and principles of sentencing.  See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-115(b).  
Our  adoption  of  the  abuse  of  discretion  standard  has  not  eliminated  the  requirements 
associated  with  section  40-35-115.    See  Pollard,  432  S.W.3d  at  863  (stating  that  the 
adoption of the abuse of discretion standard did not eliminate the requirements necessary 
to impose consecutive sentencing for the dangerous offender classification under section 
40-35-115(b)(4)). 

n  this  appeal,  the  question  presented  by  the  Defendant  focuses  on  the  initial 
determination  under  section  40-35-115(b)(2)—whether  the  Defendant  was  an  offender 
whose record of criminal activity was extensive. 

B. Consecutive Sentencing Under Section 40-35-115(b)(2) 

 

As  a  general  matter,  in  determining  an  appropriate  sentence,  the  Sentencing  Act 

provides that the trial court shall consider: 

  A

The evidence, if any, received at the trial and the sentencing hearing; 
The presentence report;

Evidence and information offered by the parties on the mitigating and 
enhancement factors set out in §§ 40-35-113 and 40-35-114;

the courts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in Tennessee;

behalf about sentencing; and 

                                              

9 We recently recognized a similar structure in the context of probation revocation hearings.  State 
v. Dagnan, 641 S.W.3d 751 (Tenn. 2022).  In Dagnan, we held that the standard of review for probation 
revocation decisions—both the decision of whether or not to revoke probation and the decision, assuming 
revocation, of what consequence to impose—is abuse of discretion with a presumption of reasonableness.  
Id.  at  753.    However,  we  noted  that  as  a  prerequisite,  “the  trial  court  must  determine  whether  the 
preponderance  of  the  evidence  at  the  revocation  hearing  establishes  that  the  defendant  violated  the 
conditions of his or her release.”  Id. at 757 n.4.

enn.  Code  Ann.  § 40-35-210(b).    Additionally,  the  Sentencing  Act  identifies  various 
purposes of sentencing at Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-102.  See Bise, 380 
S.W.3d  at  691.    Likewise,  the  Sentencing  Act  also  identifies  various  principles  of 
sentencing,  sometimes  referred  to  as  “considerations,”  at  Tennessee  Code  Annotated 
section 40-35-103.  See Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 689 n.7.  These purposes and principles, in 
the  context  of  consecutive  sentencing,  reflect  that  “[a]lthough  statutory  criteria  may 
support the imposition of consecutive sentences, the overall length of the sentence must be 
‘justly deserved in relation to the seriousness of the offense[s],’ Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-
102(1), and ‘no greater than that deserved’ under the circumstances, id. at § 40-35-103(2).”  
Sneed,  302  S.W.3d  at  828–29.    As  for  consecutive  sentencing  under  section  40-35-
115(b)(2)  in  particular,  we  have  observed  that  “[c]onsecutive  sentencing  based  on  an 
offender’s extensive record of criminal activity is appropriate to protect society from those 
who ‘resort to criminal activity in furtherance of their anti-societal lifestyle.’”  Dickson, 
413 S.W.3d at 749 (quoting Gray v. State, 538 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tenn. 1976)).  In addition, 
consecutive sentencing under section 40-35-115(b)(2) is appropriate “to protect the public 
from an individual not likely to be rehabilitated.”  State v. Brewer, 875 S.W.2d 298, 303 
(Tenn. Crim. App. 1993). 

  T

ection 40-35-115(b)(2) authorizes consecutive sentencing for an offender “whose 
record of criminal activity is extensive.”  However, this classification is not self-defining, 
and  the  Sentencing  Act  does  not  provide  a  precise  meaning.    Most  significantly,  the 
Sentencing Act does not define what constitutes an “extensive” record of criminal activity.  
Tennessee law requires that the criminal code be “construed according to the fair import of 
its terms.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-11-104 (2018).  We have recognized that, in the absence 
of statutory definitions, we may look to authoritative dictionaries.  State v. Deberry, 651 
S.W.3d 918, 925 (Tenn. 2022); State v. Majors, 318 S.W.3d 850, 859 (Tenn. 2010); accord 
Crawford  v.  Metro.  Gov’t  of  Nashville  &  Davidson  Cnty.,  555  U.S.  271,  276  (2009) 
(observing  that  a  statutory  term  left  undefined  by  the  statute  “carries  its  ordinary 
meaning”).    In  common  usage,  “extensive”  is  defined  in  various  ways,  all  sharing 
similarities.    For  instance,  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  defines  “extensive”  as  “[w]idely 
extended  in  space,  time, or  scope.”    Extensive,  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (6th  ed.  1990).  
Merriam-Webster’s  definitions  include  “marked  by  considerable  length,”  “large  in 
amount,”  or  “considerable  in  number.”    Extensive,  Webster’s  3d  New  Int’l  Dictionary 
(1986).    Similarly,  the  Oxford  English  Dictionary  defines  “extensive”  in  various  ways, 
including “extending over or occupying a large surface or space,” “large in amount,” or 
“large in scope.”  Extensive, The Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989).  Needless to 
say, these definitions provide guidance but not precise directions.  However, we glean from 
them  a  common thread  from  which  we  conclude  that  an  “extensive”  record  of  criminal 
activity, for purposes of section 40-35-115(b)(2), is that which is considerable or large in 
amount, time, space, or scope.

hus, in  making the finding that an offender has an extensive record of criminal 
activity,  courts  should  look  to  those  facts  from  which  they  can  determine  that  the 
defendant’s record of criminal activity is considerable or large in amount, time, space, or 
scope.  Our prior opinions have not examined consecutive sentencing under section 40-35-
115(b)(2) in significant detail.  See Dickson, 413 S.W.3d at 748–49; Sneed, 302 S.W.3d at 
828–29; State v. Banks, 271 S.W.3d 90, 147–48 (Tenn. 2008); State v. Allen, 259 S.W.3d 
671, 689–90 (Tenn. 2008); State v. Pettus, 986 S.W.2d 540, 545 (Tenn. 1999).  This appeal 
presents  an  opportunity  for  this  Court  to  offer  guidance  on  relevant  considerations  that 
ordinarily  will  inform  the  determination  of  whether  an  offender’s  record  of  criminal 
activity is extensive.  To that end, and with the general definitions of “extensive” in mind, 
courts should look to the following non-exclusive considerations in evaluating whether the 
proof  establishes  that  the  defendant  is  an  offender  whose  record  of  criminal  activity  is 
extensive: 

The  amount  of  criminal  activity,  often  the  number  of  convictions,  both 
currently  before  the  trial  court  for  sentencing  and  prior  convictions  or 
activity;10 
The time span over which the criminal activity occurred;11 
The frequency of criminal activity within that time span;12 
The geographic span over which the criminal activity occurred;13 

                                              

10 See, e.g., Dickson, 413 S.W.3d at 748 (finding extensive criminal activity based on “numerous 
prior convictions” indicating “a consistent pattern of operating outside the confines of lawful behavior”); 
Sneed, 302 S.W.3d at 829 (finding extensive criminal activity based on fifty contempt convictions presently 
before the Court).

(6)  Any other fact about the defendant or circumstance surrounding the criminal 
activity  or  convictions,  present  or  prior,  that  informs  the  determination  of

in amount, time, space, or scope. 

These considerations very well may intersect in a given case, such that one consideration 
is best understood in reference to another.15  Having set forth the considerations, we will 
offer more detail in the context of examining them as applied to this case. 
 

C. The Trial Court’s Consecutive Sentencing Determination 

he Defendant argues to this Court that some lower courts, “including the trial court 
and a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeals panel in this case[,] seem to think that 
once a defendant has a certain number of convictions, no other proof is needed to establish 
by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  a  record  of  criminal  activity  is  ‘extensive’  for 
purposes of section 40-35-115(b)(2).”  Building on this argument, the Defendant contends 
that his number of convictions is misleading in the sense that he 

leaded guilty to 24 offenses—not because the proof showed that his actions 
demonstrated  prolonged  or  sustained  criminal  activity—but  because  the 
statute that governs aggravated sexual exploitation provides that a defendant 
‘may  be  charged  in  a  separate  count  for  each  individual  image,  picture, 
drawing,  photograph,  motion  picture  film,  videocassette  tape,  or  other 
pictorial representation,’ regardless of whether all materials were acquired or 
downloaded as part of the same act or transaction. 
 

The Defendant argues that because the “number of convictions was solely a function of the 
nature in which the aggravated sexual exploitation statute allowed the State to indict,” the 
trial court “should not have relied solely on the number of convictions” to determine that 
he was an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive. 

he record reflects that, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the trial court 

addressed the question of consecutive sentencing as follows: 

                                              

14 See, e.g., State v. Hepburn, No. M2008-01979-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 WL 2889101, at *11 (Tenn. 
Crim. App. July 23, 2010) (finding extensive criminal activity based on, in part, sixty-two property offenses 
against twenty-six businesses); State v. Wells, No. W2003-02282-CCA-R3-CD, 2004 WL 1606976, at *2 
(Tenn. Crim. App. July 16, 2004) (finding extensive criminal activity based on, in part, forty-eight property 
offenses against at least twenty-eight victims). 

5 The facts bearing on these considerations likely also will provide at least part of the basis from 
which the trial court decides, in its discretion, whether to impose consecutive sentencing and, if so, how 
many terms to run consecutively.

Now, the State has requested that I consider consecutive sentencing 
and  certainly  that  is  something  I  have  to  look  at.    I  also  consider  the 
presentence  report  and  the  [D]efendant’s  physical  and  mental  condition 
which,  you  know,  he admits to this serious child pornography problem.  I 
consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the offenses and primarily 
I’m  looking  at  the  number  of  images  that  he  had  downloaded,  174  either 
photographs or videos involving child pornography which is extensive.  It’s 
a large number of documents and items that he possessed.  I do give great 
weight to that. 

 do find under T[enn]. C[ode] A[nn]. [§] 40-35-115 that his record of 
criminal activity is extensive based upon the number of convictions and the 
number  of  offenses  he’s  committed  and  the  number  of  offenses  he’s  pled 
guilty to.  I do find that to be extensive. 

  I

  I

 also consider the fact that he not only possessed these, but apparently 
he  shared  and  traded  a  lot of  these  child  pornography  videos  and  pictures 
with other individuals.  You know, I do take that into consideration as part 
of the facts and circumstances of this case. 
 

After deciding to impose partial consecutive sentencing for an effective term of eighteen 
years of imprisonment, the trial court further commented: 
 

I feel like the 18 year sentence is appropriate given the extensive criminal 
convictions here today.  I also find that the aggregate length of this 18 year 
sentence reasonably relates to the number of offenses for which the defendant 
stands  convicted.    As  I  said,  174  separate  items  in  each  one  he  could  be 
sentenced for, I mean, each one could carry anywhere from eight to twelve 
years just for one,16 but I am going to give him – just run these three counts 
consecutive to all of the other counts so it will be a total of 18 year sentence 
that he’ll have to serve. 

gainst  this  factual  backdrop,  we  examine  the  trial  court’s  determination  that  the 
Defendant was an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive in light of the 
considerations we set forth earlier in this opinion.

16 The trial court misspoke with respect to the potential term for each separate item.  The relevant 
offense would be a Class B felony, with a sentencing range of eight to twelve years, only if the number of 
items were greater than twenty-five.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 39-17-1004(a)(4); 40-35-112(a)(2).  Indeed, 
six  of  the  Defendant’s  convictions  were  Class  B  felonies,  and  the  trial  court  sentenced  the  Defendant 
accordingly.  However, the sentencing range for an offense related to each individual item, a Class C felony, 
would be three to six years.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 39-17-1004(a)(4); 40-35-112(a)(3).

Tennessee  courts  uniformly  consider  the  amount  of  criminal  activity,  often  the 
number of convictions, in deciding consecutive sentencing under section 40-35-115(b)(2).  
See, e.g., Dickson, 413 S.W.3d at 748; Sneed, 302 S.W.3d at 829.  The fact obviously bears 
on the question of whether an offender has an extensive record of criminal activity.  In this 
case, the trial court recognized that the Defendant has no prior convictions.  Although not 
a point of contention in this appeal, we clarify that a defendant need not have prior criminal 
convictions  or  activity  to  qualify  as  an  offender  whose  record  of  criminal  activity  is 
extensive for purposes of section 40-35-115(b)(2).  See Sneed, 302 S.W.3d at 829 (citing 
State v. Cummings, 868 S.W.2d 661, 664, 667 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992)); State v. Palmer, 
10 S.W.3d 638, 648–49 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999).  Of course, prior convictions or criminal 
activity may demonstrate “a consistent pattern of operating outside the confines of lawful 
behavior” and provide some stronger measure of justification for finding that a defendant 
is an offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive.  Dickson, 413 S.W.3d at 748.  
However, we do not believe the Sentencing Act requires criminal activity apart from that 
for which the defendant is being sentenced to support the relevant finding under section 
40-35-115(b)(2).17 

he State points out in its brief before this Court that the Defendant—twenty-two 
years old at the time of sentencing—does have a record of prior criminal activity in the 
form of occasional marijuana usage, from age fifteen through approximately twenty, and 
occasional  underage  alcohol  consumption,  beginning  at  age  seventeen.    The  trial  court 
referred to this criminal activity in setting the length of the Defendant’s individual terms, 
giving “some substantial weight” to the marijuana usage but “[not] a lot of weight” to the 
alcohol usage.  However, although obviously aware of the criminal activity, the trial court 
did not refer to this activity when addressing the issue of consecutive sentencing.18 

s for present criminal activity, the trial court clearly observed that the Defendant 
pleaded guilty to twenty-four counts of aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor, stating 
that the Defendant’s “record of criminal activity is extensive based  upon the number of 
convictions.”  The Defendant contends that the number of convictions is misleading—and 

                                              

17 “Record” certainly can refer to a history of prior convictions.  See Record, The Oxford English 
Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (defining “record,” in part, as an account of a person’s conduct in a particular 
sphere, especially a record or history of criminal convictions or prison sentences).  However, we do not 
believe “record” as used in section 40-35-115(b)(2) is confined to criminal convictions (or criminal activity) 
other than that for which the defendant is being sentenced.  Instead, we believe that “record” refers more 
generally to the sum of the defendant’s actions or conduct in the particular area of criminal activity.  See 
Record, Webster’s 3d New Int’l Dictionary (1986) (defining “record,” in part, as a body of known, recorded, 
or available facts about something); see also Palmer, 10 S.W.3d at 648 (identifying an offender’s “record” 
of criminal activity as “his or her history of criminal activity,” including both the offenses for which the 
defendant is being sentenced and any other criminal activity). 

8 Similarly, although the record contains evidence of some limited prior criminal activity, given 
the nature and circumstances of the activity, we believe it carries very little, if any, weight in establishing 
that the Defendant has an extensive record of criminal activity.

does  not  reflect  an  extensive  record  of  criminal  activity—in  that  it  is  the  result  of 
prosecutorial charging discretion.19  The Defendant therefore argues that the fact that he 
stands  convicted  of  twenty-four  offenses,  by  itself,  does  not  establish  a  sufficient  basis 
from which to find that he has an extensive record of criminal activity and that the trial 
court erred by relying “solely on the number of convictions” to find that he qualified for 
consecutive sentencing under section 40-35-115(b)(2). 

ased  on  our  review  of  the  record,  however,  we  respectfully  disagree  with  the 
Defendant’s contention that the trial court relied solely on the fact that he stood convicted 
of twenty-four offenses in determining that he qualified as an offender whose record of 
criminal activity was extensive.  The trial court also considered the number of images and 
videos,  referring  to  the  “large  number  of  documents  and  items  that  [the  Defendant] 
possessed” as “extensive.”  In our view, the trial court properly looked to the amount of 
child  pornography  that  the  Defendant  possessed—for  that  was  the  nature  of  the 
Defendant’s criminal activity—in determining whether his record of criminal activity was 
extensive.  Moreover, we agree with the trial court that possession of 174 images or videos 
of child pornography, regardless of the resulting number of convictions, reflects criminal 
activity that was considerable in amount or scope. 

urthermore,  the  trial  court  also  considered  the  fact  that  the  Defendant  not  only 
possessed the 174 images or videos at issue, but also admittedly had shared or traded child 
pornography  with  others.    In  our  view,  this  fact  bears  on  the  scope  of  the  Defendant’s 
criminal activity.  We agree with the trial court that actually having shared or traded child 
pornography reflects criminal activity on the part of the Defendant more considerable in 
scope than simply having possessed child pornography, even with intent to distribute or 
exchange. 

he Defendant makes the point that the trial court failed to consider the time span 
involved  in  committing  the  offenses,  suggesting  that  “the  illegal  materials  were 
downloaded  online,  and  thus  could  have  been  acquired  all  at  one  time,  in  a  single 
transaction.”  Indeed, the record reflects that the trial court did not refer to the time span of 
the Defendant’s criminal activity when addressing consecutive sentencing, nor did the trial 
court  directly  address  the  frequency  of  criminal  activity  within  the  time  span.20    As  we 
explained  above,  the  time  span  of  criminal  activity  and  frequency  of  criminal  activity 
within that time span often are relevant considerations in determining whether an offender 
has  an  extensive  record  of  criminal  activity.    In  this  respect,  the  trial  court’s  failure  to 

                                              

19 Of course, although the State has charging discretion under the applicable statute, the Defendant 
voluntarily chose to plead guilty to twenty-four separate counts.  We also note that the Defendant did not 
make this point—that his number of offenses was misleading and did not reflect an extensive record of 
criminal activity—to the trial court at the sentencing hearing. 

0 The record does reveal that earlier in the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated: “Back in 2016 

and 2017 was the time he committed the offenses.”

address these considerations reveals a shortcoming in addressing whether the Defendant 
qualified  as  an  offender  whose  record  of  criminal  activity  was  extensive  under  the 
circumstances of this case.21 

onsidering the entirety of the record, however, we do not believe the trial court’s 
deficiency  in  specifically  addressing  the  time  span  and  frequency  of  criminal  activity 
negates the presumption of reasonableness for the sentencing decision.  The record shows 
that the trial court specifically—and properly—articulated the substantive sources for its 
sentencing decision and followed appropriate sentencing procedure.  Furthermore, the trial 
court identified on the record multiple facts—all properly related to relevant considerations 
concerning  the  amount  and  scope  of  the  Defendant’s  criminal  activity—from  which  it 
found that the Defendant qualified as an offender whose record of criminal activity was 
extensive.    The  trial  court  articulated  on  the  record  its  reasons  for  ordering  partial 
consecutive sentencing, thereby providing a basis for meaningful appellate review.   See 
Pollard, 432 S.W.3d at 862.  Accordingly, the trial court’s findings, although lacking in 
some respects, were sufficient to merit the presumption of reasonableness.  Cf. Bise, 380 
S.W.3d  at  705–06  (holding  that  a  trial  court’s  misapplication  of  an  enhancement  or 
mitigating factor does not invalidate the presumption of reasonableness).  Thus, we must 
uphold the trial court’s sentencing decision absent an abuse of discretion.  See Pollard, 432 
S.W.3d at 862. 

A court abuses its discretion when it causes an injustice to the party challenging 
the  decision  by  (1)  applying  an  incorrect  legal  standard,  (2)  reaching  an  illogical  or 
unreasonable decision, or (3) basing its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the 
evidence.”    Harmon  v.  Hickman  Cmty.  Healthcare  Servs.,  Inc.,  594  S.W.3d  297,  305 
(Tenn.  2020)  (quoting  Lee  Med.,  Inc.  v.  Beecher,  312  S.W.3d  515,  524  (Tenn.  2010)).  
Having carefully reviewed the record, we discern no such error on the part of the trial court 
in  ordering  partial  consecutive  sentencing  totaling  eighteen  years  of  imprisonment  after 
finding that the Defendant was an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive.  
The  Defendant  pleaded  guilty  to  twenty-four  separate  offenses.    We  recognize  that  the 
nature  of  the  Defendant’s  offenses  resulted  in  flexibility  as  to  how  many  individual 
offenses  he  was  charged  with,  and  this  circumstance  is  worthy  of  consideration  in 
evaluating  the  amount  of  criminal  activity  at  issue  in  this  case  and  the  appropriate 
sentence.22  To that end, however, the record is clear that the Defendant possessed a large 
amount of child pornography—174 images or videos, involving multiple different minors 
and  multiple  sex  acts.    Moreover,  the  Defendant  not  only  possessed  the  174  images  or 
videos with the intent to distribute or exchange, the Defendant admittedly shared or traded 
child pornography with others.  Lastly, although the trial court did not engage in an analysis 
                                              

21 We note that neither the State nor the Defendant made mention of the time span or the frequency 

of criminal activity when arguing before the trial court as to consecutive sentencing. 

2  We  reiterate,  however,  that  the  Defendant  voluntarily  chose  to  plead  guilty  to  twenty-four 

separate offenses.

of the time span or frequency of the Defendant’s criminal activity when deciding the issue 
of  consecutive  sentencing,  according  to  the  factual  basis  recounted  at  the  guilty  plea 
hearing, the Defendant’s criminal activity “took place during the years 2016 and 2017.”  
Furthermore, the record indicates that the Defendant uploaded files to his Dropbox account 
on multiple occasions.  In other words, the record belies any notion that the Defendant’s 
criminal activity was comprised of a single occasion.  Because the parties did not develop 
this issue at the sentencing hearing, the record leaves some degree of uncertainty as to just 
how  considerable  the  Defendant’s  criminal  activity  was  in  terms  of  time  span  and 
frequency.23  Nevertheless, the record in this regard does not militate against the conclusion 
that  other  facts  demonstrated  that  the  Defendant’s  criminal  activity  was  considerable  in 
amount and scope.  Thus, the record supports the trial court’s finding that the Defendant 
was an offender whose record of criminal activity was extensive.  From our review, the 
Defendant  has  not  demonstrated  that  the  trial  court  applied  an  incorrect  legal  standard, 
reached an illogical or unreasonable decision, or based its decision on a clearly erroneous 
assessment of the evidence.  Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial court’s sentencing 
decision. 
 

III. CONCLUSION 

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining that 
the Defendant qualified under Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b)(2) as an 
offender  whose  record  of  criminal  activity  was  extensive  and  in  imposing  partial 
consecutive sentencing for an effective total term of eighteen years of imprisonment.  We 
therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals. 

ecause the Defendant appears to be indigent, the costs of this appeal are taxed to

23  We  again  note  that  the  Defendant  bears  the  burden  of  showing  on  appeal  that  the  sentence 
imposed by the trial court is improper.   See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-401(d) (Sentencing Commission 
Comments).
