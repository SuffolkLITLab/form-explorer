Acknowledgements

The members of the Advisory Task Force on Composition of Judicial Districts express their 

gratitude to the General Assembly for giving us this opportunity to serve our State. Each 
of us is honored and humbled by the confidence and trust the Speaker of the House and 

Lieutenant Governor placed in us. 

 
The Task Force has received generous help in the preparation of this report from a 
number of people. We must mention and thank General Counsel Rachel Harmon and Legal 
Project Assistant Ceesha Lofton with the Administrative Office of the Courts. Both were tireless 
in responding to our demands. They have worked their professional magic to get our mass 
of opinions into the written word and to ensure this report’s completion under the tightest of 
deadlines.

 
We are indebted to everyone who submitted a public comment or who spoke at one of 
our five public hearings. We wish we could list them. They are too numerous to list individually 
but each of their insights were valuable to us. Without them it would have been impossible to 
prepare this report.

We also thank Deborah Tate, Administrative Director of the Administrative Office of the 

 
Courts; Jerry Estes, Executive Director of the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference; 
Patrick Frogge, Executive Director of the Tennessee District Public Defenders Conference; Katelin 
Brown, Tennessee General Assembly, Office of the Senate Clerk; Kathy Blount, Madison County 
Circuit Court Clerk; President Chris Whaley, Roane State Community College; the Honorable 
Royce Taylor, 16th Judicial District; Melissa Harrell, Rutherford County Circuit Court Clerk; and 
Dean Katharine T. Schaffzin, Cecil C. Humphrey’s School of Law at the University of Memphis. 

 
Our meetings and hearings would not have been possible without the technical 
assistance of Shaun Vandiver, David Metler, Brady Troutt and Nathan Howell with the Technology 
Division of the Administrative Office of the Courts. And we are grateful to Communications 
Director Barbara Peck and Webmaster Sue Ann Olson with the Administration of the Courts 
for the design and layout of this report and the creation and maintenance of the Task Force’s 
informational web page. 

This report could not have been written without the assistance of Benjamin D. Marsee, 

 
Assistant District Public Defender, 13th Judicial District. Mr. Marsee provided invaluable research 
and editing. 

This report would not exist without the leadership of Chancellor Telford Forgety. As 

 
Chairman he has kept the Task Force on focus and presided over our meetings with patience, 
openness and forbearance. Each of us has been overwhelmed by his efforts.

 

Any mistakes contained in this report are ours and ours alone.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. The public is overwhelmingly opposed to judicial district realignment 

 

 

 

 

2. Because of demographic changes, the 21st Judicial District should be realigned  

3. Future weighted caseload studies need to include both District Attorneys General  
 

and District Public Defenders   

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. There is no need to realign judicial district lines in West Tennessee, including the  
 
 

30th Judicial District, or in East or Middle Tennessee  

 

 

5. There should be no reduction in judges in West Tennessee, including the 30th  
 

Judicial District, or in East or Middle Tennessee 

 

 

 

 

6. Because of population growth, the General Assembly should consider devoting  
 
 

more resources to Tennessee’s Judicial System.

Advisory Task Force on the Composition of Judicial DistrictsCurrent judicial districts in Tennessee 
range from single county urban districts 
like the 20th judicial district, which 
encompasses Davidson County, shown 
above, to large geographic districts that 
span multiple counties from Alabama 
to Kentucky. Some areas, like Hickman 
County, pictured left, sit on the cusp of 
suburban and rural development and 
have been impacted by growth in their 
neighboring counties.

Advisory Task Force on the Composition of Judicial DistrictsOverview of Tennesee’s Judicial System

Constitution establishes the 

Article VI of Tennessee’s 

State’s judicial branch. The 

State’s courts constitute one of the co-

equal branches of government. The 

State Constitution vests judicial power 

in one Supreme Court and such “Circuit, 

Chancery and other inferior courts as 
the Legislature” elects to create.2 Unlike 
federal judges, State judges serve 

eight-year terms. Judges are subject to 

impeachment or removal as provided in 

the Tennessee Constitution in Articles V 

and VI.

Tennessee’s Courts and Their 
Administration

Types of State Courts. Tennessee 

has a four-tier court system. The 

Tennessee Supreme Court is the highest 

court in the State. The next tier consists of 

the State’s two co-equal appellate courts: 

the Tennessee Court of Appeals and the 

State’s General Sessions Courts, Juvenile 

Courts, and Municipal Courts. 

Tennessee Supreme Court. The 

Tennessee Supreme Court is established 
by the State Constitution.3 It is the highest 
court in the State. The Supreme Court 

consists of a Chief Justice and four 
associate justices.4 Cases from either 
the Court of Appeals or the Court of 

Criminal Appeals may be appealed to the 
Tennessee Supreme Court.5 Unlike the 
Court of Appeals and Court of Criminal 

Appeals, the Tennessee Supreme Court is 

not required to hear every case brought 

before it. In addition to being the highest 

court in the State, the Tennessee Supreme 

Court also has the authority to administer 
Tennessee’s judicial system.6 The General 
Assembly has recognized that the 

Supreme Court has “general supervisory 

control over all the inferior courts of the 
State.” 7

Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals. 

Intermediate Appellate Courts. 

The third tier consists of Tennessee’s trial 

courts of record: Circuit, Chancery, and 

Criminal. The fourth tier consists of the 

Tennessee’s Courts of Appeal and 
Criminal Appeals form the State’s inferior 
appellate courts.8 The General Assembly

three grand divisions. These divisions 
are Eastern, Middle and Western.9 The 
General Assembly has also created two 

Appellate Courts, the Court of Appeals 
and the Court of Criminal Appeals.10 
Generally, litigants who lose their case 

before a court of record may appeal their 

case to either of these two Appellate 
Courts.11 These appellate courts have 
jurisdiction over cases appealed from 
the counties within their grand division.12 
These appellate courts review cases to 

determine if the trial court applied the law 

correctly. 

Trial Courts. Tennessee has three 

types of trial courts: Circuit, Chancery, 

and Criminal. Both Circuit and Chancery 
Courts are constitutionally mandated.13 It is 
in the State’s trial courts where cases are 

tried, witnesses testify, and juries serve. 

Tennessee trial judges have the broadest 

judicial responsibility. The State’s trial 

judges conduct a wide range of judicial 

proceedings, including hearings, bench 

trials, and jury trials. Only the State’s trial 

 
The General Assembly has divided 
the State into thirty-one Judicial Districts.15 
Each county in Tennessee has been 

placed in one of these districts. It is the 

responsibility of each county comprising 

a Judicial District to provide to its trial 
judges sufficient space to conduct court.16

 

There are currently 156 State 

trial judges. State trial judges are State 

employees. Most State trial judges serve 

in multiple counties. In the vernacular of 
the 19th century, they ride the circuit of 
their respective districts. 

Circuit Courts are courts of general 

 
jurisdiction.17 They are empowered to 
resolve all civil disputes except in those 

instances where the General Assembly 

has vested other courts with exclusive 
jurisdiction.18 Circuit Courts also have 
jurisdiction to hear criminal cases.19

 
Chancery Courts are courts of 
equity.20 Their judges are referred to 
as Chancellors. The Chancery Court’s

Chancery Court has concurrent jurisdiction 

over criminal cases by interchange. 

with Circuit Court over all civil actions 

except for actions concerning unliquidated 
damages for personal injury.21  For 
example, Chancery Court has exclusive 

jurisdiction to hear and determine any 

case in which there is a dispute about 

the location of a boundary line between 
adjacent tracts of land.22 Additionally, 
Chancery Court has jurisdiction over 

persons who have been deemed 
incompetent. 23 

General Sessions Courts. General 
Sessions Courts exercise jurisdiction in a 

narrower range of cases than State trial 
courts.26 Unlike State trial judges, General 
Sessions judges serve, in most cases, 
only one county.27 Additionally, they are 
county rather than State employees.28 The 
number of General Sessions judges in any 

particular county is approved and funded 

by that county’s County Commission and 

enacted by the General Assembly. General

clerical.43  Clerks or their deputies sign all 
summonses, executions, and processes.  

They are responsible for the preservation 
and filing of court records.44 Court 
clerks are county officials and county 
employees. 45 Circuit and Criminal Court 
clerks are elected by the citizens of their 

counties for four-year terms. A Chancery 

Court Clerk, called a Clerk and Master, 

is appointed to a six-year term by the 
judicial district’s Chancellor.46 These clerks 
are judicial officers cloaked with many 

of the same powers as the Chancellor 

themselves. For example, a Clerk and 

Master may determine if it is necessary 

to sell a decedent’s land in order to pay 

taxes, decide if land should be sold or 

partitioned, and even open and adjourn 
court in absence of the Chancellor.47

Tennessee’s District Attorneys General 
are constitutional officers.48 Their primary 
duty is to prosecute criminal cases in their

Courts. To assist the Tennessee Supreme 
Court in its responsibility to ensure 

efficient operation of the judicial system, 

the Tennessee General Assembly 

created the Administrative Office of 
the Courts.40 The Administrative Office 
of the Courts is led by a director.41 This 
Administrative Director acts as the chief 

administrative officer of the courts of the 

State and is appointed by the members 

of the Tennessee Supreme Court. The 

Administrative Director works under the 

supervision and the direction of the Chief 

Justice. The Administrative Director has a 

number of duties. Among these is the duty 

to make a careful and continuing survey 

of the caseloads of the Circuit, Criminal, 

and Chancery Courts and to report this 

information to the General Assembly

Before then, decisions regarding judicial

cases that are reopened each year;

required to handle cases of each type 

of this strategy were an under-resourced

judiciary and an inequitable distribution of 

judges among the judicial districts. In some 

instances, these conditions compromised 

both access to justice and the quality of 

case resolution for some segments of the 

State’s population. 

 

In an effort to remedy this, the 

General Assembly adopted an evidence-

based process for determining judicial 
needs.57 The General Assembly mandated 
the use of a workload assessment, also 

known as a weighted caseload study or 

needs assessment, to determine the future 

need for judicial resources. 

 

The weighted caseload study 

calculates judicial need for the State’s trial 
courts58 based on total judicial workload. 
The weighted caseload formula consists of 

four elements: 

4.  The judge year value, or the amount of 

time each judge has available for case-

related work in one year.

 

The total judicial workload is 

calculated by multiplying the annual filings 

of each case type by the corresponding 

weight, then adding the product for 

all types of cases. The resulting total 

workload is then divided by the year 

value to determine the total number of 

full-time equivalent judges needed to 

handle a judicial district’s caseload. Finally, 

the result is compared with the actual 

number of judges on the bench in order to 

determine whether changes in the size of 

the judiciary are necessary.

 

By weighting cases to account 

for the differences in judicial workload 

associated with each type of case, the

Districts are each located in two different 
time zones.59 

 

The Task Force concludes that 

judicial districts should be made up of 

contiguous counties. That is, the district 

should be physically connected without 

over burdening the public, witnesses, 

attorneys, or a judge’s ability to travel 

within the judicial district. District lines

the legal community have developed

17

Advisory Task Force on the Composition of Judicial DistrictsFindings & Recommendations

of the current judicial districts, 

After a comprehensive review 

public input in the form of 

appearances before the Task Force’s five 

public hearings, as well as written public 

comments, and all available caseload 

data, the Task Force submits the following 

conclusions and recommendations.

1. The public is overwhelmingly  
opposed to judicial district 
realignment. 

With the exception of Hickman, 

Lewis, and Perry counties, the input from 

the public received by the Task Force was 

almost universal in expressing a strong 

desire that all judicial districts remain as 

currently configured. The vast majority 

of the public comments expressed that 

each individual judicial district, no matter 

how oddly shaped, worked efficiently. 

District Attorneys General and District 

Public Defenders from individual districts 

expressed concern about their ability to 

adequately provide services in the event 

of realignment. This concern centered 

around existing collateral resources 

and the availability of local funds, as 

well as communities’ long-standing ties. 

Local public officials expressed similar 

reservations. Local law enforcement’s 

reservations were most pronounced.

2. Because of demographic 
changes, the 21st Judicial 
District should be realigned.

The 21st Judicial District consists 

of Hickman, Lewis, Perry, and Williamson 

counties. Over the past several decades, 

Williamson County has experienced 

massive population growth. In 1980 the 
county’s population was 58,108.65 It is 
estimated that the current population 
equals 231,729.66 Growth is expected to 
continue. The Boyd Center projects that 

by 2039, Williamson County’s population 
could grow to as high as 340,816.67 

The population boom in Williamson 

County has caused populations in 

neighboring counties to perceive a 

disconnect. Public officials and private 

citizens from Hickman, Lewis, and Perry 

counties stridently expressed their 

view that they are ignored by officials 

in Williamson County. Both the elected 

District Attorney General and District 
Public Defender for the 21st Judicial

Final Report 2019District report that they devote 

additional State resources to these 

counties which would otherwise 

be unavailable to them because of 

the county resources provided to 

both offices by Williamson County. 

The Task Force takes no position 

with respect to these conflicting 

viewpoints. Nevertheless, the 

differences between Williamson 

County and Hickman, Lewis, and 

Perry counties cannot be reconciled. 

The district no longer constitutes a 

“community of interest.”

It is the recommendation of the 

Task Force that Hickman, Lewis, and Perry 

counties be separated from Williamson 

County, and that they form their own 

separate judicial district, referred to in 
the public hearings as the 32nd Judicial 
District. This recommendation carries with 

it two caveats. The first is that the new 

judicial district should be staffed with a 

District Attorney General and necessary 

assistants and staff members as well as 

a District Public Defender and necessary 

assistants and staff members. The second 

caveat is that the District Attorney General 
and the District Public Defender of the 21st 
Judicial District should retain all of their 

present assistants and staff to continue to 
serve the growing 21st Judicial District.

This recommendation is supported 

by the factors relied upon by the Task

Force. First, the public opinion expressed 

for this change is strong. This factor 

reveals that a bottom-up approach to 

realigning judicial districts may in fact 

be the best approach. Said another way, 

where there is a problem with a judicial 

district, those most affected will send a 

clear signal to either the Task Force or 

the legislature expressing the need for 

change. 

Second, recommending this new 

judicial district is consistent with the 

present judicial weighted caseload study. 

The most current weighted caseload study 

indicates that Hickman, Lewis, and Perry 

counties should be served by a single 

judge. There is an opportunity for cost 

savings to the State related to the judiciary

Third, realignment in this instance 

is consistent with the strong desire of 

aligning together communities with 

common interests. Public comments taken 

by the Task Force indicate that the three 

smaller counties have greater cultural 

ties together than they do to Williamson 

County. Public comment indicates that, as 

a result of population growth, Williamson 

County has become more urban. In

are prepared to take the steps necessary 

to ensure that no loss of services will 

occur and that access to justice will be 

preserved.

3. Future weighted caseload 
studies need to include both 
District Attorneys General 
and District Public Defenders. 

District Attorneys General and 

District Public Defenders serve not only 

trial courts, but also General Sessions

This recommendation is not 

without concerns, nor is it a unanimous 

recommendation of the Task Force’s 

members. Specifically, the Task Force 

anticipates that there will be a reduction

these counties. The concerned citizens

District Public Defenders be based upon 

a weighted case load study, along with 

other relevant factors such as expected 

population growth. 

4. Except in the 21st Judicial 
District, there is no need to realign 
judicial districts anywhere in 
Tennessee. 

Based on all of the factors 

considered by the Task Force, there is no 

current need for change in district lines 
in Tennessee, except in the 21st Judicial 
District as indicated above. The public’s 

response indicates that there is no desire 

for change in any of the judicial districts 

5. There should be no reduction in 
judges in Tennessee, including the 
30th Judicial District. 

Considering all the guiding 

principles that apply to the allocation 

of judicial resources the Task Force 

concludes that there should be no 

reductions in judges in any judicial district.

West Tennessee has attracted 

attention regarding the number judges 

serving that part of the State, Shelby 

County in particular. The most recent 

weighted caseload study indicates that 

there is no need for a reduction in judges 

in any of the western judicial districts. 

Another consideration is that

other than that already outlined. All of the 
concerns previously alluded to regarding 

not recommend a reduction in judicial 
resources in any judicial district.

continues to grow, so will the need for 

additional judges. As the Task Force 

evaluated the judicial districts, the greatest 
present judicial need is in the 19th, 22nd, 
and 23rd Judicial Districts. In the event that 
the General Assembly creates additional 

judicial positions they should be assigned 

to these districts.

In making this recommendation,

As best it could, the Task Force studied

that present methodology of adding ADAs 

and APDs and staff continue.

 

In reaching this conclusion, the 

Task Force is cognizant of the fact that 

District Attorneys General and District 

Public Defenders serve not only State 

trial courts, but also General Sessions 

Courts and Municipal Courts. While data 

exists for trial court caseloads in the 

form of weighted caseload studies, no 

similar data is yet available for General 

Sessions Courts and municipal courts. 

Compounding this is a lack of any 

weighted caseload model for ADAs or 

APDs. With no standardized, reliable data 

accounting for all the work that ADAs and 

APDs do, or a statistically-valid method 

for interpreting that data, any staffing 

allocation recommendation made by the 

Task Force would amount to little more 

than guess work.

 

The lack of good information 

to guide appropriate staffing 

recommendations for ADAs and APDs 

mirrors the lack of complaints from District 

Attorneys General and District Public 
Defenders about their historical, ad hoc 
methodology for assigning positions in the
