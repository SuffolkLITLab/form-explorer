      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT NASHVILLE
Assigned on Briefs January 3, 2023

EVON KAY CREGER v. DANIEL WILLIAM CREGER

Appeal from the Chancery Court for Rutherford County

No. 19CV-68

Bonita Jo Atwood, Judge

___________________________________

No. M2022-00558-COA-R3-CV
___________________________________

In  this  divorce  action,  the  trial  court  distributed  the  parties’  marital  assets  and  debts, 
fashioned  a  parenting  plan  naming  the  mother  primary  residential  parent  and  providing
the  father  with  fifty-five  annual  days  of  co-parenting  time,  and  set  the  father’s  child 
support  obligation.    The  father  has  appealed.   Discerning  no  reversible  error,  we  affirm 
the trial court’s judgment.  Deeming this to be a frivolous appeal, we grant the mother’s
request for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred on appeal and remand this issue 
to the trial court for a determination regarding the amount.

Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Chancery Court

OPINION

I.  Factual and Procedural Background

This  case  originated  with  the  filing  of  a  complaint  for  divorce  by the  plaintiff, 
Evon  Kay  Creger  (“Mother”),  against  the  defendant,  Daniel  William  Creger  (“Father”), 
in  the  Rutherford  County  Chancery  Court  (“trial  court”)  on  January  18,  2019.    Mother
stated  that  the  parties  had  been  married  since  August  2005.    Two  daughters  were  born 
during the marriage, K.C. and A.C. (“the Children”), who were ages thirteen and eleven, 

03/16/2023respectively, at  the  time  of  the  complaint’s  filing.    Mother initially  sought  a  divorce  on 
the ground of irreconcilable differences.

On  May  6,  2019,  Mother filed  an  amended  petition,  adding  the  ground  of 
inappropriate  marital  conduct  by  Father.    Mother sought  to  be  designated  primary 
residential parent of the Children and requested entry of a temporary parenting plan.  On 
May  8,  2019,  the  trial  court  appointed  a  special  master  to  hear  the  “interim  issues,” 
including an appropriate temporary parenting plan.

On May 22, 2019, Mother filed a petition for an order of protection, alleging that 
Father had followed her in his vehicle and driven aggressively behind her when she had 
the  Children  in  her car.    Mother further  stated  that  Father was  very  angry,  had  sent 
harassing text messages, and had a history of domestic violence.  The trial court entered 
an  ex  parte order  of  protection  that  same  day,  which  was  later  consolidated  with  the 
instant divorce proceedings by agreed order.  

On June 6, 2019, Father was charged with a violation of the order of protection for 
driving  to  Mother’s  new  home  and  for  texting  one  of  the  parties’  daughters.    The  trial 
court  entered  an  agreed  order  on  June  24,  2019,  providing  that  the  Children  would 
continue in counseling with Elysse Beasley and that Father would schedule joint sessions 
with  the  Children  and  Ms.  Beasley  so  that  the  parties  could  request  a  recommendation 
and  status  evaluation  from  Ms.  Beasley  within  approximately  six  weeks  of  the  order’s 
entry.  

On  August  14,  2019,  Father filed  an  answer  and  counter-petition,  averring 
additional  grounds  for  divorce  and  requesting  that  he  be  designated  primary  residential 
parent  of  the Children.    On  November  22,  2019,  the  trial  court  entered  an  agreed  order 
providing  that  Father would  receive  regular  intervals  of  co-parenting  time  with  the 
Children on specified days and during specified two- to four-hour periods, with the visits 
taking place in a “public setting.”  The order further directed that: (1) the parties and the 
Children  would  continue  their  counseling  sessions  with  Ms.  Beasley; (2)  the  Children 
would  each  receive  a  psychological  evaluation  by  Dr.  Jay  Woodman; and  (3)  neither 
party would discuss the case, counseling sessions, or psychological evaluations with the 
Children  or  make  disparaging  remarks  about  the  other  parent  in  the  presence  of  the 
Children.

On  February  18,  2020,  Mother filed  a  motion  seeking  restriction  of  Father’s  co-
parenting time.  In support, Mother alleged that Father had violated the trial court’s order 
by, inter alia, discussing with the Children the divorce proceedings and also speaking to 
them  about  Mother  and  her  counsel  in  a  derogatory manner.    Mother  asserted  that  she 
possessed a recording of Father’s comments.   On April  16, 2020, the trial court entered
another agreed order stating that Father’s visitation would be temporarily suspended and 
that  Father  and  the  Children  would  “intensify  and  expedite”  their  counseling  sessions 
- 2 -

with  Dr.  Woodman  until  Dr.  Woodman  could  reach  a  conclusion  that  Father’s  co-
parenting time should resume or be suspended or restricted.

On April 28, 2020, Father filed a motion seeking to bifurcate the divorce and order 
of  protection  proceedings  and  to  set  a  hearing  respecting the  latter.    Mother  filed  a 
response opposing bifurcation, postulating that the order of protection proceedings were 
inextricably linked to the divorce and co-parenting issues.  Father’s counsel was allowed 
to  withdraw  by  order  dated  June  1,  2020,  and  Father’s  new  counsel  entered  a  notice  of 
appearance on June 10, 2020.

On  August  28,  2020,  Father  filed  a  motion  seeking  reduction  or  temporary 
suspension of his child support obligation.  Father, who had previously been employed as 
the chief executive officer of a dermatology practice, claimed that since the beginning of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, he had been unable to obtain employment in the medical field 
despite  having applied to  more  than  ten  positions  per  month  in  several  different  states.  
Father  filed  another  motion  on  October  16,  2020,  requesting  (1)  co-parenting  time  with 
the Children, (2) dismissal of the order of protection, (3) permission to sell unimproved 
real  property  owned  by  the  parties,  (4)  reduction  of  his  child  support  obligation,  (5) 
waiver  of  mediation,  (6)  requirement  that  the  parties  file  proposed  parenting  plans,  and 
(7) designation of a trial date.  On October 29, 2020, Father’s counsel filed a motion to 
withdraw from his representation of Father.  On November 5, 2020, the trial court entered 
an agreed order substituting Father’s counsel.

Following  a  hearing  conducted  on  November  19,  2020,  the  trial  court  entered  an 
agreed  order  on  December  3,  2020,  stating  that  the  parties  had  agreed  to  list  their 
unimproved  real  property  for  sale.    The  court  determined  that  the  requirement  of 
mediation  should  be  waived  and  that  the  order  of  protection  relating  to  the  Children 
should  be  terminated.    With  respect  to  the  order  of  protection  applicable  to  Mother, 
however,  the  court  determined  that  it  would  remain  in  full  force  and  effect.    The  court 
also found that little or no progress had been made during counseling sessions involving 
Father  and  the  Children.    A new  counselor,  Laura  Tucker-Huggins, was  appointed  to 
work  with  the  parties  and  the  Children  toward  the  “concept  of  reunification  between 
father and the children.”  

The trial court further stated that it was “adamantly and strenuously admonish[ing] 
each  party  that  they  are  not  to discuss  any  matter  associated  with  this  divorce  with  the 
minor  children,  nor  disparage  the  other  party  in  the  presence  of  the  children  and 
counseling,” noting that “[v]iolations of this admonishment will be taken very seriously.”  
The  court  awarded  Father unsupervised,  daytime  periods  of  co-parenting  time  with  the 
Children  during  certain holidays  and  on  Saturdays,  pending  further  orders.    The  court 
also stated that Father could call the Children up to three times per week.

On June 2, 2021, Father filed a motion requesting that the trial court “reconsider or 
review  the  real  estate  transaction  as  ordered  on  November  19,  2020.”    According  to
Father, he had placed a sign on the property with his telephone number and had received 
offers  from  various  interested parties.    Father  asserted  that  the  realtor  appointed  by  the 
court had suggested an auction of the property and that Father disagreed with this course 
of action.  For proof, Father attached offers concerning the property to his motion as well 
as a transcript of his text messages with the court-appointed realtor.

The trial court conducted a hearing on July 7, 2021, regarding Father’s motion and 
considered  testimony  from  Father,  the  realtor,  and  another  witness.    The  court 
subsequently entered an order on July 20, 2021, making the following findings:

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The Order of the Court as filed December 3, 2020 is very clear and 
[Father] has  been  non-cooperative  and  has  intentionally  and 
deliberately disobeyed the Order of the Court.

The Court finds it proper to apologize to Mr. Muse and Ms. Taylor 
[the  realty  agents]  due  to  the difficulties  they  have  encountered  as  
and  selling agents  and  as  a  result  of  professional  board complaints 
levied against them by [Father].

The  Court  finds  that  Mr.  Muse  and  Ms.  Taylor  are  experts  within 
this  field  and  that [Father] is  not  a  real  estate  expert,  nor  a  soil 
scientist,  but has  decided  upon  his  own  to  disregard the  Court’s 
orders and to run the sale upon his perceived terms.

The  Court  finds  that  [Father] is  not  above  the  law  and  is appalled 
by the actions of [Father].

Accordingly, the trial court ordered Father to immediately remove all signs he had placed 
upon the property as well as the lock on the gate preventing access to the property.  The 
court also directed that Mother would handle the sale of the property and ordered Father 
to  refrain  from  interfering  with  the  sale  of  the  property.    The  court  further  decreed  that 
Father was prohibited from speaking with third parties regarding purchase of the property 
and that he should dismiss the complaints he  had filed against the realtors.  On July 27, 
2021, the trial court entered an agreed order substituting counsel for Father.

On  December  1,  2021,  Father  filed  motions  seeking  to  dissolve  the  order  of 
protection  concerning  Mother  and  seeking a  reduction  or  temporary  suspension  of  his 
child support obligation.  Father averred that he had not been charged with a violation of 
the order of protection for over two years and that the existence of the order of protection 
had hindered his ability to procure employment.  Mother opposed these motions.

On December 13, 2021, the trial court entered an agreed order stating that Father 
would  begin  enjoying  co-parenting  time  with  the  Children  every  other  weekend from 
Friday at 5:00 p.m. to Sunday at 5:00 p.m.  Father was also awarded co-parenting time of 
three  hours  every  other  Thursday  evening  for  a  “date/dinner  night.”    Father  was  further 
permitted to communicate with the Children via text, email, or telephone.

The  trial  court  entered  a subsequent order  on  December  17,  2021,  concerning 
Father’s  pending  motions.    The  court  denied  Father’s  request  to  dissolve  the  order  of 
protection,  noting  that  this  issue  would  be  addressed  at  trial.    The court  also  denied 
Father’s request to reduce or suspend his child support obligation, finding that Father had 
the  ability  to  provide  support.    The  court  ordered  that  the  parties  could  each  collect a 
$50,000.00 disbursement from the funds being held by the title company from the sale of 
their  unimproved  real  property  and  that  the  remaining  funds  being  held  by  the  title 
company  would  be  deposited  with  the  court.    The  matter  was  set  for  trial  on  March  3, 
2022.    Thereafter,  the  title  company  filed  notice  that  it  had  deposited the  remaining 
proceeds from the real property’s sale with the court in the amount of $1,071,361.95.

On  February  17,  2022,  Mother  filed  a  statement  of  issues,  income,  and  expenses 
pursuant  to  16th Judicial  District  Local  Rule  12.02.    Therein,  Mother  indicated  that  her 
monthly  gross  income  was  $13,333.00  from  her  employment  and  that  she  also  received 
quarterly bonuses of $9,000.00 as well as $1,718.00 per month in child support.  Mother 
claimed monthly expenses for herself and the Children in the amount of $13,003.59.  As 
evidence,  Mother  attached  pay  stubs,  income  tax  returns,  and  other  documentation.  
Father filed his statement on March 2, 2022, the day before trial, claiming that he had no 
income and that he had total monthly expenses of $7,090.90.

The trial court conducted a hearing in this matter on March 3, 2022.  At the outset, 
Mother’s counsel objected to consideration of Father’s statement filed pursuant to Local 
Rule 12.02 because it was not signed under oath and was not filed at least eight judicial 
days  before  the  hearing  in  accordance  with  the  rule’s  requirements.    Mother’s  counsel 
also  pointed  out  that  Father  had  never  filed  a  witness  list  or  an  exhibit  list.    When 
questioned by the court, Father’s counsel admitted that he had reviewed the court’s local 
rules  before  accepting  the  representation and  that  he  had  known  about  the  trial  date  for 
approximately  six  weeks.    The  court  determined  that  Father  should  be  precluded  from 
presenting  any  documentary  evidence or  other  witnesses at  trial.    Accordingly,  the  trial 
proceeded, and  the  court  heard  testimony  from  the  parties;  Lieutenant  David  Cutshaw, 
Smyrna Police Department; Brad Muse, realtor; as well as Ms. Beasley and Ms. Tucker-
Huggins, counselors.  

Following  trial,  on  March  9,  2022,  Father  filed  with  the  trial  court  a  statement 
demonstrating  that  his  trial counsel  had  been the  subject  of  disciplinary  actions  in  other 
states.   On  March  30,  2022,  the  trial  court  entered  an  agreed  order  substituting  Father’s 
counsel.

On  April  12, 2022,  the  trial  court  entered  a comprehensive  final  judgment  of 
divorce.    The  court  made  extensive  findings  concerning  Father’s  behavior  both  prior  to 
and since entry of the order of protection, including that Father had “chased” Mother and 
the  Children  down  the  highway  using his  vehicle.    Furthermore, he  had  disobeyed  the 
court’s order by texting the Children.  The court also found that Father had disobeyed the 
standard  order  issued  by  the  court  upon  filing  of  the  divorce  complaint  by  purchasing  a 
new vehicle and withdrawing $100,000.00 in marital funds.  Moreover, he had disobeyed 
the  court’s  other  orders  by  intentionally  and  deliberately  interfering  with  the  sale  of 
marital property and by failing to pay his equal share of the counseling costs.  The court 
noted that Father had failed to consistently attend counseling sessions with the Children 
and  had  made  derogatory  and  disparaging  remarks  concerning  Mother’s  intelligence, 
body parts, and weight in the presence of the Children.  The court concluded that Father’s 
relationship with the Children was strained and had been for numerous years prior to the 
divorce proceedings due in part to his difficulty with controlling anger and his propensity 
to blame Mother and the Children for his behavior.

The  trial  court  determined  that  both  counselors  who  testified  were  credible.  
According  to  the  initial  counselor,  Ms.  Beasley,  Father  had  told  A.C.  that  he  wanted  to 
“watch  Mother  suffer”  and  had  admitted  to  making  inappropriate  comments  to  the 
Children  regarding  their bodies  and  Mother’s  body.    The  subsequent  counselor,  Ms. 
Tucker-Higgins, testified that Father maintained a weak bond with the Children and had 
continued to  make disparaging remarks to the Children about their bodies and Mother’s 
body, including sexual comments.  The court credited Ms. Tucker-Higgins’s assessment 
that  it  would  be  detrimental  to  the  Children  for  Father  to  exercise equal  co-parenting 
time.    The  court  further  credited  the  testimony  of  Lt.  David  Cutshaw  concerning  his 
“numerous” encounters with Father regarding visitation after the order of protection was 
issued.

The  trial  court  found  Mother  to  be  a  credible  witness  as  well,  determining  that 
Father  had  emotionally  and  physically  abused  Mother  by  throwing  cans  at  her,  shoving 
her, and making derogatory remarks regarding her.  In contrast, the court found Father’s 
testimony  to  be  “problematic”  and  “weighed  his  testimony  accordingly.”    The  court 
awarded  the  parties  a  divorce  in  accordance  with  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  §  36-4-
129(b) (2021).

Following  its  consideration  of  the  factors  listed  in  Tennessee  Code  Annotated  § 
36-4-121(c)  (2021)  concerning  an  equitable  distribution  of  marital  assets,  the  trial  court 
determined that both parties (1) possessed significant earning capacity, (2) had substantial 
estates at the time of the  marriage, and (3) were of similar ages.  The court again noted 
that  Father  had  liquidated  marital  assets  to  support  his  lifestyle following  the  parties’ 
separation.  The court further found that Father had failed to pursue gainful employment 
while Mother had maintained her employment and income.  The court thus proceeded to 
- 6 -

divide  the  parties’ marital  assets  and  debts  in  what  it  determined  to  be  an  equitable 
fashion.

Considering  the  testimony  at  trial,  the  court  issued  a  restraining  order  preventing 
Father’s  contact  with  Mother  for  one  year.    The  court  dismissed  the  previously  entered 
order of protection pursuant to Father’s request due to his claim that it interfered with his 
ability  to  obtain  employment.    The  court  then  analyzed  the  factors  enumerated  in 
Tennessee  Code  Annotated  §  36-6-106  to  determine which  parent  should  be  designated 
primary  residential  parent  and  how  co-parenting  time  should  be  divided.    Based  on  the 
testimony  of  the  counselors,  the  trial  court  concluded  that  joint  decision-making 
responsibility would not be in the Children’s best interest.  

Finding that the applicable factors listed in Tennessee Code Annotated § 36-6-106 
primarily  weighed  in  Mother’s  favor,  the  trial  court  determined  that  Mother  should  be 
designated as primary residential parent and that Father would enjoy fifty-five days of co-
parenting  time  with  the  Children  annually,  to  be  exercised  primarily  on  alternating 
weekends.    Mother  was  granted sole  decision-making  responsibility respecting  the 
Children.

Regarding Father’s income, the trial court determined that Father was voluntarily 
unemployed, finding that he had failed to actively pursue employment since March 2020 
due  to  the  order  of  protection.    The  court  found  that  Father  had  earned  $92,967.00  in 
2019  before  his  termination  and  that  he  possessed  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  and  the 
ability  to  earn  income.    The  court  also  found  that  Father’s  stated  reasons  for  failing  to 
pursue  gainful  employment  were  not  credible,  noting  that  Father  had  withdrawn 
$100,000.00  from  a  marital  retirement  account in  2020 and  purchased  a  new  vehicle in 
his company’s name while insisting that he did not have sufficient funds from which to 
pay child support.  The court concluded that Father had relied on the use of marital assets 
to  fund  his  lifestyle  rather  than  seeking  gainful  employment.    The  court therefore  set 
Father’s  income  at  $92,967.00  for  child  support  purposes.    As  such,  Father’s  child 
support obligation was set at $1,005.00 per month.

The  trial  court  ordered  Father  to  pay  retroactive  child  support  for  seventeen 
months,  from  the  date  of  the  divorce  complaint’s  filing  to  the  date  of  the  child  support 
order’s  entry  in  June  2020,  in  the  amount  of  $1,005.00  per  month,  for  a  total  of 
$17,085.00.  The court also ordered Father to pay one-half of the counseling costs in the 
amount  of  $11,046.76 as  well  as  unpaid  medical  expenses  and  expenses  related  to  the 
marital residence that had been paid by Mother.

The  trial  court  entered  a  permanent  parenting  plan  (“PPP”)  naming  Mother 
primary  residential  parent  of  the  Children  and  awarding  her  310  days  of  co-parenting 
time per year.  Father was awarded 55 days of co-parenting time per year, to be exercised 
on alternating weekends and some holidays.  A child support worksheet was also entered 
- 7 -

demonstrating that  Father’s  support  obligation  was  set  at  $1,005.00  per  month.    Father 
timely appealed.

II.  Issues Presented

Father  presents  the  following  issues  for  this  Court’s  review,  which  we  have 

restated slightly:

1.

2.

3.

Whether the trial court erred in its distribution of the parties’ marital 
property.

Whether the trial court erred by awarding Father only fifty-five days 
of co-parenting time per year.

Whether  the  trial  court  erred  by  refusing  to  consider  Father’s 
exhibits,  including  his  witness  and  exhibit  list, his  proposed 
parenting plan, his proposed division of marital assets and liabilities, 
and other documents.

Mother presents the following additional issue, which we have also restated slightly:

4.

Whether Father’s appeal is frivolous such that Mother should receive 
an award of damages.

III.  Standard of Review

We  review  a  non-jury  case  de  novo  upon  the  record  with  a  presumption  of 
correctness  as  to  the  findings  of  fact  unless  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  is 
otherwise.    See  Tenn.  R.  App.  P.  13(d);  Bowden  v.  Ward,  27  S.W.3d  913,  916  (Tenn. 
2000).    We  review  questions  of  law  de  novo  with  no  presumption  of  correctness.  
Bowden, 27 S.W.3d at 916 (citing Myint v. Allstate Ins. Co., 970 S.W.2d 920, 924 (Tenn. 
1998)); see also In re Estate of Haskins, 224 S.W.3d 675, 678 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006).  In 
addition, the trial court’s determinations regarding witness credibility are entitled to great 
weight on appeal and shall not be disturbed absent clear and convincing evidence to the 
contrary.  See Morrison v. Allen, 338 S.W.3d 417, 426 (Tenn. 2011); Jones v. Garrett, 92 
S.W.3d 835, 838 (Tenn. 2002).

In a case involving the proper classification and distribution of assets incident to a 

divorce, our Supreme Court has elucidated the applicable standard of review as follows:

This  Court  gives  great  weight  to  the  decisions  of  the  trial  court  in 
dividing  marital  assets  and  “we  are  disinclined  to  disturb  the  trial  court’s 
decision  unless  the  distribution  lacks  proper  evidentiary  support  or  results 
- 8 -

in  some  error  of  law  or  misapplication  of  statutory  requirements  and 
procedures.” Herrera  v.  Herrera,  944  S.W.2d  379,  389  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
1996).    As  such,  when  dealing  with  the  trial  court’s  findings  of  fact,  we 
review the record de novo with a presumption of correctness, and we must 
honor  those  findings  unless  there  is  evidence  which  preponderates  to  the 
contrary.  Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d); Union Carbide Corp. v. Huddleston, 854 
S.W.2d 87, 91 (Tenn. 1993).  Because trial courts are in a far better position
than this Court to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, the weight, faith, 
and credit to be given witnesses’ testimony lies in the first instance with the 
trial  court.    Roberts  v.  Roberts,  827  S.W.2d  788,  795  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
1991).    Consequently,  where  issues  of  credibility  and  weight  of  testimony 
are  involved,  this  Court  will  accord  considerable  deference  to  the  trial 
court’s  factual  findings.    In  re  M.L.P.,  228  S.W.3d  139,  143  (Tenn.  Ct. 
App.  2007)  (citing  Seals  v.  England/Corsair  Upholstery  Mfg.  Co.,  984 
S.W.2d  912,  915  (Tenn.  1999)).    The  trial  court’s  conclusions  of  law, 
however,  are  accorded  no  presumption  of  correctness.  Langschmidt  v. 
Langschmidt, 81 S.W.3d 741, 744-45 (Tenn. 2002).

Keyt v. Keyt, 244 S.W.3d 321, 327 (Tenn. 2007). 

This  Court  reviews  a  trial  court’s  determination  of  an  appropriate  parenting  plan 
according  to  an  abuse  of  discretion  standard.  See Morelock  v.  Morelock,  No.  E2016-
00543-COA-R3-CV, 2017 WL 3575890, at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 18, 2017) (quoting 
Kelly  v.  Kelly,  445  S.W.3d  685,  692  (Tenn.  2014)).    “[C]ustody  and  visitation 
arrangements  are  among  the  most  important  decisions  confronting  a  trial  court  in  a 
divorce case.  The needs of the children are paramount; while the desires of the parents 
are secondary.”  Gaskill v. Gaskill, 936 S.W.2d 626, 630 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996).  

Father’s  issue  on  appeal  concerning  the  exclusion  of  evidence  is  also  reviewed 
under  an abuse  of  discretion  standard.    Hill  v.  Hill,  No.  M2006-01792-COA-R3-CV, 
2008  WL  110101,  at  *4  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Jan.  9,  2008).    As  our  Supreme  Court  has 
previously instructed:

A trial court abuses its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard or 
reaching an illogical or unreasonable decision that causes an injustice to the 
complaining party. In reviewing the trial court’s exercise of discretion, we 
presume that the trial court’s decision is correct and review the evidence in 
a  light  most  favorable  to  upholding  the  decision. Discretionary  decisions, 
however,  require  a  conscientious  judgment,  consistent  with  the  facts,  that 
takes into account the applicable law.  

White  v.  Beeks,  469  S.W.3d  517,  527  (Tenn.  2015)  (internal  citations  omitted).  
Furthermore,  “[c]oncluding  that  a  trial  court  improperly  excluded  otherwise  admissible 
- 9 -

evidence  does  not  end  the  inquiry.”    White  v.  Vanderbilt  Univ.,  21  S.W.3d  215,  223 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1999).    Unless  the  erroneous  exclusion  of  the  evidence  would  have 
affected  the  outcome  of  the  trial,  this  Court  will  not  reverse  the  judgment  based  on  the 
trial court’s evidentiary decision.  Id. 

IV.  Marital Property Equitable Distribution

In his initial issue, Father argues that the trial court erred in its distribution of the 
parties’ marital property.  As Mother points out, however, Father has failed to include in 
his appellate brief a table meeting the requirements of Tennessee Court of Appeals Rule 
7, which provides in pertinent part:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

In  any  domestic  relations  appeal  in  which  either  party  takes  issue 
with  the  classification  of  property  or  debt  or  with  the  manner  in 
which  the  trial  court  divided  or  allocated  the  marital  property  or 
debt,  the  brief  of  the  party  raising  the  issue  shall  contain,  in  the 
statement  of  facts  or  in  an  appendix,  a  table  in  a  form  substantially 
similar to the form attached hereto.  This table shall list all property 
and  debts  considered  by  the  trial  court,  including:  (1)  all  separate 
property,  (2)  all  marital  property,  and  (3)  all  separate  and  marital 
debts.

Each  entry  in  the  table  must  include  a  citation  to  the  record  where 
each party’s evidence regarding the classification or valuation of the 
property or debt can be found and a citation to the record where the 
trial court’s decision regarding the classification, valuation, division, 
or allocation of the property or debt can be found.

If  counsel  disagrees  with  any  entry  in  the  opposing  counsel’s  table, 
counsel  must  include  in  his  or  her  brief,  or  in  a  reply  brief  if  the 
issue  was  raised  by  opposing  counsel  after  counsel  filed  his  or  her 
initial brief, a similar table containing counsel’s version of the facts.

Accordingly, “in all cases where a party takes issue with the classification and division of 
marital property, the party must include in its brief a chart displaying the property values 
proposed by both parties, the value assigned by the trial court, and the party to whom the 
trial  court  awarded  the  property.”  Kanski  v.  Kanski,  No.  M2017-01913-COA-R3-CV, 
2018  WL  5435402,  at  *6  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Oct.  29,  2018) (quoting  Akard  v.  Akard,  No. 
E2013-00818-COA-R3-CV, 2014 WL 6640294, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2014)).

With regard to these requirements, this Court has previously explained:

- 10 -

[I]t is essential that the parties comply with Rule 7 in order to aid this Court 
in reviewing the trial court’s decision. The table required by Rule 7, allows 
this Court to easily and correctly determine the valuation and distribution of 
the  marital  estate  as  ordered  by  the  trial  court.  Further,  the  Rule  7  table, 
allows this Court to ascertain the contentions of each party as to the correct 
valuations  and  proper  distribution,  as  well  as  the  evidence  in  the  record 
which the party believes supports its contention.  Consequently, a table, in 
full compliance with Rule 7, is vital as this Court must consider the entire
distribution of property in order to determine whether the trial court erred. 
Moreover,  this  Court  is  under  no  duty  to  minutely  search  the  record  for 
evidence  that  the  trial  court’s  valuations  may  be  incorrect  or  that  the 
distribution may be improper.

Kanski, 2018 WL 5435402, at *6 (quoting Harden v. Harden, No. M2009-01302-COA-
R3-CV,  2010  WL  2612688,  at  *8  (Tenn.  Ct. App.  June  30,  2010))  (internal  citations  in
Harden omitted in Kanski).

As  the  Kanski  Court  also  explained,  “[w]e  previously  have  held  that  “where  an
appellant  fails  to  comply  with  this  rule,  that  appellant  waives  all  such  issues  relating  to 
the rule’s requirements.” Kanski, 2018 WL 5435402, at *6 (quoting Stock v. Stock, No. 
W2005-02634-COA-R3-CV,  2006  WL  3804420,  at  *5  n.3  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Dec.  28, 
2006)).    Although  “this  Court  may  ‘suspend  the  requirements  of  Rule  7  for  ‘good 
cause,’” Kanski, 2018 WL 5435402, at *6 (quoting Hopwood v. Hopwood, No. M2015-
01010-COA-R3-CV, 2016 WL 3537467, at *7 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 23, 2016)) (in turn 
quoting Tenn. R. Ct. App. 1(b)), we discern no good cause for such a suspension in this 
case.   See  Williams  v.  Williams,  No.  E2021-00432-COA-R3-CV,  2022  WL  1043632,  at 
*15  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Apr.  7,  2022).    We  therefore  deem  Father’s  issue  presented 
concerning the propriety of the trial court’s marital property distribution to be waived.

V.  Co-Parenting Residential Schedule

Father  next  takes  issue  with  the  trial  court’s  designated  co-parenting  schedule.  
Father contends that the trial court erred by awarding him only fifty-five days of annual 
co-parenting  time  with  the  Children.    Mother  counters  that  the residential schedule  set 
forth in the trial court’s PPP was appropriate and in the best interest of the Children.

At the time of a divorce when at least one minor child is involved, as occurred in 
this  case,  the  trial  court  must  “make  a  custody  determination”  “on  the  basis  of  the  best 
interest  of  the  child.”  See Tenn. Code  Ann.  §  36-6-106(a)  (Supp.  2022).  The  court  is 
required  to  apply  statutory  “best  interest”  factors  enumerated  in  Tennessee  Code 
Annotated  §  36-6-106(a)  to  determine  a  custody  arrangement  in  the  best  interest  of  the 

- 11 -

Child.  The version of Tennessee Code Annotated § 36-6-106(a) (2021) applicable to this 
action provided:1  

In  a  suit  for  annulment,  divorce,  separate  maintenance,  or  in  any  other 
proceeding requiring the court to make a custody determination regarding a 
minor  child,  the  determination  shall  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  best 
interest  of  the  child.    In  taking  into  account  the  child’s  best  interest,  the 
court  shall  order  a  custody  arrangement  that permits  both  parents  to  enjoy 
the  maximum  participation  possible  in  the  life  of  the  child  consistent  with 
the factors set out in this subsection (a), the location of the residences of the 
parents,  the  child’s  need  for  stability  and  all  other  relevant  factors.    The 
court  shall  consider  all  relevant  factors,  including  the  following,  where 
applicable:

(1) 

(2) 

The  strength,  nature,  and  stability  of  the  child’s  relationship  with 
each  parent,  including  whether  one  (1)  parent  has  performed  the 
majority  of  parenting  responsibilities  relating  to  the  daily  needs  of 
the child;

Each  parent’s  or  caregiver’s  past  and  potential  for  future 
performance  of  parenting  responsibilities,  including  the  willingness 
and  ability  of  each  of  the  parents  and  caregivers  to  facilitate  and 
encourage  a  close  and  continuing  parent-child  relationship  between 
the  child  and  both  of  the  child’s  parents,  consistent  with  the  best 
interest  of  the  child.    In  determining  the  willingness  of  each  of  the 
parents  and  caregivers  to  facilitate  and  encourage  a  close  and 
continuing  parent-child  relationship  between  the  child  and  both  of 
the  child’s  parents,  the  court  shall  consider  the  likelihood  of  each 
parent  and  caregiver  to  honor  and  facilitate  court  ordered  parenting 
arrangements  and  rights,  and  the  court  shall  further  consider  any 
history  of  either  parent  or  any  caregiver  denying  parenting  time  to 
either parent in violation of a court order;

(3) 

Refusal  to  attend  a  court  ordered  parent  education  seminar  may  be 
considered  by  the  court  as  a  lack  of  good  faith  effort  in  these 
proceedings;

(4) 

The  disposition  of  each  parent  to  provide  the  child  with  food, 
clothing, medical care, education and other necessary care;

                                           
1 Effective March 18, 2022, the General Assembly has amended Tennessee Code Annotated §36-6-106(a) 
to  add  as  an  additional  best  interest  factor  “[w]hether  a  parent  has  failed  to  pay  court-ordered  child 
support for a period of three (3) years or more.”  See 2022 Tenn. Pub. Acts, Ch. 671 (H.B. 1866).

- 12 -

(5) 

The  degree  to  which  a  parent  has  been  the  primary  caregiver, 
defined  as  the  parent  who  has  taken  the  greater  responsibility  for 
performing parental responsibilities;

(6) 

The love, affection, and emotional ties existing between each parent 
and the child;

(7) 

The emotional needs and developmental level of the child;

(8) 

The moral, physical, mental and emotional fitness of each parent as 
it relates to their ability to parent the child.  The court may order an 
examination  of  a  party  under  Rule  35  of  the  Tennessee  Rules  of 
Civil Procedure and, if necessary for the conduct of the proceedings, 
order  the  disclosure  of  confidential  mental  health  information  of  a 
party  under  §  33-3-105(3).    The  court  order  required  by  §  33-3-
105(3)  must  contain  a  qualified  protective  order  that  limits  the 
dissemination of confidential protected mental health information to 
the  purpose  of  the  litigation  pending  before  the  court  and  provides 
for  the  return  or  destruction  of  the  confidential  protected  mental 
health information at the conclusion of the proceedings;

(9) 

The  child’s  interaction  and  interrelationships  with  siblings,  other 
relatives  and  step-relatives,  and  mentors,  as  well  as  the  child’s 
involvement with the child’s physical surroundings, school, or other 
significant activities;

(10)  The  importance  of  continuity  in  the  child’s  life  and  the  length  of 
time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment;

(11)  Evidence  of  physical  or  emotional  abuse  to  the  child,  to  the  other 
parent or  to  any  other  person.    The  court  shall,  where  appropriate, 
refer any issues of abuse to juvenile court for further proceedings;

(12)  The  character  and  behavior  of  any  other  person  who  resides  in  or 
frequents  the  home  of  a  parent  and  such  person’s  interactions  with 
the child;

(13)  The reasonable preference of the child if twelve (12) years of age or 
older.    The  court  may  hear  the  preference  of  a  younger  child  upon 
request.  The preference of older children should normally be given 
greater weight than those of younger children;

- 13 -

(14)  Each  parent’s  employment  schedule,  and  the  court  may  make 

accommodations consistent with those schedules; and

(15)  Any other factors deemed relevant by the court.

The  trial  court  properly  conducted  a  best  interest  analysis  considering  the  above-
listed factors.  Upon doing so, the court determined that of the applicable factors, all but 
one weighed in Mother’s favor inasmuch as factor nine weighed equally.  Based on our 
review of the evidence, we determine that the evidence supports the trial court’s findings.  
We reiterate that a trial court’s determination of an appropriate permanent parenting plan 
is reviewed according to an abuse of discretion standard.  See Morelock v. Morelock, No. 
E2016-00543-COA-R3-CV, 2017 WL 3575890, at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 18, 2017).

During trial, the court heard testimony from two counselors who had worked with 
Father  and  the  Children.    Ms.  Beasley  testified  that  she  began  counseling  sessions  with 
the  Children and  the  parties  pursuant  to  a  court  order  entered  on  June  24,  2019.    Ms. 
Beasley reported that while Mother was always compliant with scheduling and appeared 
in a timely manner for sessions, Father was prone to be late, to leave early, and had failed 
to  show  for  seven  sessions.    Ms.  Beasley further related  that  the  Children  conveyed 
feeling hurt by Father’s failure to participate in counseling with them.

According  to  Ms.  Beasley,  Father  also  made  disparaging  remarks  concerning
Mother during the sessions with the Children, including that Mother and her attorney had 
“orchestrated” the  incident  resulting  in  entry  of  the  order  of  protection.   She  added  that 
the  Children  had  described  themselves  as  feeling  fearful  and  threatened  by  Father’s 
actions during that incident such that his characterization of it was not only disparaging 
of Mother but also dismissive of the Children’s feelings.  Ms. Beasley further articulated 
that  Father  had  referred  to  Mother  as  an  “alcoholic”  during  sessions  with  the  Children.  
Moreover,  she  related  a  particular  incident  wherein  A.C.  had  expressed  fear  that  Father 
might  kill  Mother,  to  which  Father  had  responded that  Mother  was  in  a  “terrible  place” 
and that he would rather watch her “suffer.”  

Ms.  Beasley  opined  that  the  Children  did  not  seem  to  have  a  close  relationship 
with  Father  when  counseling  began  because  they  described  Father  as  not  attentive  or 
nurturing  toward  them.    The  Children  informed Ms.  Beasley  that  when  they  visited 
Father,  he  would  sleep  a  great  deal,  would  not  interact,  and  did  not  provide  them  with 
meals.  They reported that his actions were not much different before the separation and
that Mother made up for his lack of attention when she was in the home.  The Children 
also voiced a fear of Father because they had observed him act physically violent toward
Mother, describing an incident wherein Father had thrown beer cans at Mother’s head.  

Ms.  Tucker-Higgins  testified  that  she  was  appointed  as  a  counselor  for  the 
Children by the trial court in an effort to reconcile the father-daughter relationships.  Ms. 
- 14 -

Tucker-Higgins stated  that  she  had  met  with  each  child  and  each  parent  individually 
before beginning family sessions.  According to Ms. Tucker-Higgins, Mother had always 
been appropriate, timely, and compliant with the sessions.  Ms. Tucker-Higgins included
that she had not identified any alienating behavior on the part of Mother.

With  respect  to  Father,  Ms.  Tucker-Higgins stated  that  Father  had  made 
disparaging  remarks  to  the  Children  about  Mother’s  weight  and  body.    Some  of  these 
comments  were  sexual  in  nature.    Ms.  Tucker-Higgins explained  that  she  deemed the 
comments  inappropriate  and  discussed  this  with  Father.    However,  Father  continued  to 
make derogatory remarks.  

Ms.  Tucker-Higgins described  Father’s  bond  with  the  Children  as  “very  weak.”  
Ms.  Tucker-Higgins related  that  when  she  discussed  concerns  with  Father  during  the 
session,  he  would  appear to  understand  but  would  later  repeat  the  negative  behaviors.  
Ms. Tucker-Higgins also reported that A.C., the younger child, had experienced increased 
anxiety and possibly depression due to her relationship with Father.

Based on her experience with the family, Ms. Tucker-Higgins opined that it would 
be  in  the  Children’s  best  interest  for  the  trial  court  to  designate  Mother  primary 
residential parent.  She also propounded that it would be in the Children’s best interest to 
spend alternating weekends with Father.  According to Ms. Tucker-Higgins, the Children 
were not ready to spend longer periods of time with Father, and she opined that equal co-
parenting  time  would  be  detrimental  to  the  Children.    Ms.  Tucker-Higgins stressed that 
the parties could not successfully make joint decisions concerning the Children.

Mother testified that before she filed for divorce, Father spent a “couple of years” 
during which he was disengaged from her and the Children.  Mother related that he had 
been  sleeping  “a  lot,” seemed  depressed and angry, yelled often,  and  had  destroyed 
personal  property in the  house.    According  to  Mother, Father  was  also  known  to  make 
demeaning  and  negative  comments  to  and  about  her.    Mother  described  the  family’s 
interactions  as  “walking  on  eggshells”  to  avoid  angering  Father,  and  she  noted  that  this 
situation  was  upsetting  for  her  and  the  Children.    Mother  also  recalled  the  incident 
leading to her seeking an order of protection wherein Father followed her vehicle closely 
with his at a high rate of speed, frightening her and the Children.  Mother indicated that 
she was still fearful of Father at the time of trial.

Considering  the  evidence  presented  in  light  of  the  above-listed  statutory  factors, 
we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when fashioning the parties’ 
co-parenting residential schedule.  The evidence demonstrated that Mother had been the 
Children’s primary caregiver and had performed the majority of parenting responsibilities 
while  Father  was  disengaged  and  inattentive.    Father’s  behavior  during  the  divorce 
proceedings  also  demonstrated  that  he  would  not  be  likely  to  experience  improved 
performance  of  parenting  responsibilities  in  the  future  or  to  facilitate  and  encourage  the 
- 15 -

Children’s  relationship  with  Mother.    Although  both  parents  provided  income  to  the 
household  to  pay  for  necessities for  the  Children,  Mother  had  maintained  her 
employment  post-divorce  while  Father  had  failed  to  do  so  or  to  contribute  to  family 
expenses.  

The evidence established that Mother enjoyed a closer bond with the Children than 
Father and was nurturing and attentive whereas Father had alienated the Children with his 
behavior  toward  them  and  Mother.    The  counselors  testified  that  Father’s  behavior  had 
affected  the  Children’s  mental  and  emotional  health  in  a  negative  manner.    Mother 
provided  the  Children  with  stability  and  continuity,  encouraged  and  supported  their 
efforts in counseling, and worked to ensure that they felt safe.  Conversely, considerable
evidence  was  presented  regarding  Father’s  emotional  abuse,  which  had  caused  the 
Children  anxiety  and  distress.    Importantly,  the  Children’s  counselor,  Ms.  Tucker-
Higgins,  specifically  opined  that  Father’s  visitation  time  should  be  limited  due  to  the 
effect of his behavior on the Children’s mental health.

Upon careful review, we conclude that the evidence preponderates in favor of the 
trial  court’s  determination that  the  PPP and  the  co-parenting  schedule  contained  therein 
were in the best interest of the Children and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion 
in this regard.  Therefore, we affirm the trial court’s judgment respecting its co-parenting 
residential schedule.

VI.  Evidentiary Sanctions by Trial Court

Father  next  posits  that  the trial  court  erred  by  excluding Father’s  exhibits during
trial,  including  his  witness  and  exhibit  list,  his  proposed  parenting  plan,  his  proposed 
division  of  marital  assets  and  liabilities,  and  other  documents.    We  note  that  the  trial 
court’s  exclusion  of  Father’s  documentary  evidence  was  the  result  of  Father’s  failure  to 
comply with 16th Judicial District Local Rule 12.02, which states:

(A) No less than eight (8) Judicial Days prior to the Final Hearing of any 
contested  divorce  action,  the  Plaintiff  and  Defendant  shall  file  a 
“Statement  in  Compliance  with  Rule  12.02,”  in  the  form  shown  in 
Appendix  H  attached  hereto.    Both  parties  shall  attach  proof  of 
income  (i.e.  latest  W-2,  1099,  most  recent  tax  return,  or  other  such 
proof)  to  their  Rule  12.02  Statement.    All  such  statements  shall  be 
signed  by  the  filing  party  under  oath.    These  statements  shall  be 
considered  the  testimony  of  the  parties  as  to  the  issues  contained 
therein.

(B)

Valuations and listings of all assets and debts are mandatory. . . .

- 16 -

(C) 

Statements  under  this  rule  shall  be  signed  by  the  respective  party, 
under oath, and their counsel, if any.

(D) Witness and Exhibit Lists for a contested divorce trial shall be filed 

in accordance with Rule 3.01.

Local  Rule  3.01  provides  that  witness  and  exhibit  lists  shall  be  filed  with  the  clerk  and 
exchanged by counsel “at least three (3) full Judicial Days prior to trial.”  Local Rule 3.01 
further  provides  that  failure  to  do  so  “shall  be  grounds  for  exclusion” of  witnesses and 
exhibits.  

Father  acknowledges in  his  appellate  brief  that  his  trial  counsel  failed  to  file  the 
above-listed documents “until late in the afternoon of the day preceding trial.”  A review 
of the trial transcript reveals that although Father’s Rule 12.02 Statement was filed with 
the  trial  court  in  the  late  afternoon  on  the  day  before  trial,  Father’s  witness  and  exhibit 
lists  were  never  filed  with  the  court.    Before  the  trial  began,  the  chancellor  questioned 
Father’s  trial  counsel  concerning  his  knowledge  and  understanding  of  the  local  rules.  
Father’s counsel acknowledged that he was aware of the local rules and understood them.  
Although  Father  was  allowed  to  testify  during  trial  on  his  own  behalf,  the  trial  court 
precluded  Father  from  calling  additional  witnesses  or  presenting  exhibits  due  to  his 
failure to abide by the court’s local rules.

It  is  a  long-standing  principle  that  “trial  courts  are  accorded  a  wide  degree  of 
latitude  in  their  determination  of  whether  to  admit  or  exclude  evidence,  even  if  such 
evidence  would  be  relevant.”    Dickey  v.  McCord,  63  S.W.3d  714,  723  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
2001);  see  Pennington  v.  Pennington,  No.  M2007-00181-COA-R3-CV,  2008  WL 
1991117,  at  *3  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  May  7,  2008)  (“Trial  courts  have  broad  discretion  with 
respect  to  the  admission  or  exclusion  of  evidence  and  the  enforcement  of  local  rules.”). 
In addition, trial courts clearly maintain the authority to formulate their own local rules.  
See Killinger v. Perry, 620 S.W.2d 525, 525 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981) (explaining that a trial 
court “has authority to make its own rules”).

As Father points out, when determining the proper sanction for a party’s failure to 

name a witness on a witness list, trial courts ordinarily should consider:

the explanation given for the failure to name the witness, the importance of 
the  testimony  of  the  witness,  the  need  for  time  to  prepare  to  meet  the 
In  the  light  of  these 
testimony,  and  the  possibility  of  a  continuance.
considerations,  the  court  may  permit  the  witness  to  testify,  or  it  may 
exclude the testimony, or it may  grant a continuance so that the other side 
may  take  the  deposition  of  the  witness  or  otherwise  prepare  to  meet  the 
testimony.

Pennington, 2008 WL 1991117, at *3 (quoting Strickland v. Strickland, 618 S.W.2d 496, 
501 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1981)).

Father urges that the trial court abused its discretion by declining to waive its local 
rules  and  by  failing  to  perform  the  analysis  described in  Pennington.    Father  also 
contends that he was prejudiced by the trial court’s decision to limit his ability to present 
evidence  at  trial.    We  determine,  however,  that  Father’s  arguments  are  impacted  by  his 
failure to make an offer of proof at trial in compliance with Tennessee Rule of Evidence 
103(a) (“Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which . . . excludes evidence unless a 
substantial  right  of  the  party  is  affected,  and .  .  .  the  substance  of  the  evidence  and  the 
specific evidentiary basis supporting admission were made known to the court by offer or 
were apparent from the context.”).  This failure ordinarily renders the issue waived.  See 
Hill, 2008 WL 110101, at *5-6.  As the Hill Court explained:

The  Tennessee  Rules  of  Evidence  provide  that a  trial  court’s  error 
may  not  be  predicated  upon  a  ruling  which  admits  or  excludes  evidence 
unless  “a  substantial  right  of  the  party  is  affected,”  and  when  the  ruling 
excludes  evidence,  “the  substance  of  the  evidence  and  the  specific 
evidentiary  basis  supporting  admission  were  made  known  to  the  court  by 
offer or were apparent from the context.” Tenn. R. Evid. 103.  As the rule 
of evidence provides, the burden was on Mother to preserve the substance 
of the evidence [the excluded witness] was expected to present so that this 
court  may  determine  whether  a  substantial  right  has  been  affected. 
Unfortunately,  once  the  trial  court  excluded  [the  witness],  Mother  did  not 
make an offer of proof.

The  due  process  right  to  a  full  hearing  before  a  court  includes  the 
right  to  introduce  evidence  and  have  judicial  findings  based  upon  such 
evidence.  Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. United States, 298 U.S. 349, 368-
69,  56  S. Ct.  797,  80  L. Ed.  1209  (1936).  An  erroneous  exclusion  of 
evidence,  however,  does  not  require  reversal unless  we  can  determine  the 
evidence would have affected the outcome of the trial had it been admitted. 
Pankow  v.  Mitchell,  737  S.W.2d  293,  298  (Tenn. Ct. App. 1987). The 
appellate  courts  cannot  make  such  a  determination  without  knowing  what 
the  excluded  evidence  would  have  been.  Stacker  v.  Louisville  &  N.  R.R. 
Co.,  106  Tenn.  450,  61  S.W.  766,  766  (Tenn. 1901);  Davis  v.  Hall,  920 
S.W.2d 213, 218 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995); State v. Pendergrass, 795 S.W.2d 
150, 156 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1989). It is for these reasons that the burden is 
on the party challenging the exclusion of evidence to make an offer of proof 
to  enable  the  appellate  court  to  determine  whether  the  exclusion  of
proffered evidence was reversible error.  Tenn. R. Evid. 103(a)(2); State v. 
Goad, 707 S.W.2d 846, 853 (Tenn. 1986); Harwell v. Walton, 820 S.W.2d 
116, 118 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1991).

- 18 -

An  offer  of  proof  should  contain  the  substance  of  the  evidence 
excluded  and  the  evidentiary  basis  supporting  the  admission  of  the 
evidence.  Tenn.  R.  Evid.  103(a)(2). These  requirements  may  be  satisfied 
by  presenting  the  actual  testimony,  stipulating  the  content  of  the  excluded 
evidence,  or  presenting  a  summary,  oral  or  written,  of  the  excluded 
evidence.  Harrison  v.  Laursen,  No.  01A01-9705-CH-00238,  1998  WL 
70635,  at  *3  (Tenn. Ct. App.  Feb. 20,  1998)  (citing  Neil  P.  Cohen  et  al., 
Tennessee  Law  of  Evidence §  103.4,  at  20  (3d  ed.1995)).  Generally,  the 
appellate  courts  will  not  consider  issues  relating  to  the  exclusion  of 
evidence when this tender of proof has not been made.  Dickey v. McCord, 
63 S.W.3d 714, 723 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001); Rutherford v. Rutherford, 971 
S.W.2d 955, 956 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997); Shepherd v. Perkins Builders, 968 
S.W.2d 832, 833-34 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997).

Our  courts  have  recognized  two  exceptions  to  the  rule  requiring  an 
offer of proof.  The first is contained in the rule itself and applies when the 
substance  of  the  evidence  and  the  specific  evidentiary  basis  supporting 
admission  is  apparent  from  the  context  of  the  questions.  The  second  has 
been  fashioned  by  the  courts  and  applies  when  exclusion  of  the  evidence 
seriously  affects  the  fairness  of  the  trial.  First  Nat’l  Bank  &  Trust  Co.  v. 
Hollingsworth,  931  F.2d  1295,  1305  (8th  Cir. 1991).  Neither  of  these 
exceptions is in play here.

The  record  does  not  provide  sufficient  information  for  us  to 
determine the substance of [the witness’s] testimony.  Accordingly, we are 
not  able  to  determine  whether  her  testimony  would  have  affected  the 
outcome  of  the  trial.  We  therefore  find  no  error  with  the  trial  court’s 
decision to exclude the testimony of [the witness].

Id. (footnote omitted).

Similarly,  here,  we  are  unable 

to  determine  whether  Father’s  excluded 
documentary  evidence  would  have  affected  the  outcome  of  the  trial  due  to  Father’s 
failure  to  make  an  offer  of  proof  concerning  these  documents.    We  likewise  determine 
that neither of the exceptions to requiring an offer of proof is applicable here.  As such, 
we conclude  that  Father  has  waived  the issue presented  concerning  the  trial  court’s 
exclusion of his documentary evidence.  Id.

VII.  Damages for Frivolous Appeal

Turning  now  to  Mother’s  issue,  Mother  asserts  that  Father’s  appeal  is  frivolous 
such that she should be awarded damages pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated § 27-1-
122 (2017), which provides:

When  it  appears  to  any  reviewing  court  that  the  appeal  from  any  court  of 
record  was  frivolous  or  taken  solely  for  delay,  the  court  may,  either  upon 
motion  of  a  party  or  of  its  own  motion,  award  just  damages  against  the 
appellant, which may include, but need not be limited to, costs, interest on 
the  judgment,  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  appellee  as  a  result  of  the 
appeal.

As this Court has previously explained regarding frivolous appeals:

Parties should not be forced to bear the cost and vexation of baseless 
appeals.  Accordingly,  in  1975,  the  Tennessee  General  Assembly  enacted 
Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  27-1-122  to  enable  appellate  courts  to  award  damages 
against  parties  whose  appeals  are frivolous or  are  brought  solely  for  the 
purpose  of  delay.  Determining  whether  to  award  these  damages  is  a 
discretionary decision.

A frivolous appeal  is  one  that  is  devoid  of  merit  or  one  that  has  no 

reasonable chance of succeeding.

Young  v.  Barrow,  130  S.W.3d  59,  66-67  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2003)  (internal  citations 
omitted).

In the case at bar, Father has waived two of  his three issues by failing to present 
this  Court  with  a  Court  of  Appeals  Rule  7  table  and also by  failing  to  make  an  offer  of 
proof  at  trial  concerning  his  excluded  evidence.    In  addition,  Father  was  unsuccessful 
regarding  his  sole  remaining  issue,  which  required  him  to  demonstrate  an  abuse  of 
discretion by the trial court.  As such, we agree with Mother that this appeal is frivolous.  
See,  e.g., Williams  v.  Williams,  286  S.W.3d  290,  298  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2008) (“[T]he 
issues  raised  by  Husband  on  appeal  are  reviewed  for  an  abuse  of  discretion,  a  notably 
high standard of review. Any objective review of these factors would cause a reasonable 
person to conclude that Husband’s appeal had ‘no reasonable chance of success.’”); Self 
v.  Dawn,  No.  E2021-01130-COA-R3-CV,  2022  WL  17348893,  at  *11  (Tenn.  Ct.  App. 
Dec.  1,  2022) (deeming  the  appeal  frivolous  when  the  appellant,  inter  alia,  failed  to 
present  a  proper  Rule  7  table);  Terrazzano v.  Terrazzano,  No.  M2019-00400-COA-R3-
CV,  2019  WL  6320354,  at  *2  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Nov.  26,  2019)  (deeming  the  appeal 
frivolous when the appellant “failed to present this court with a record showing that she 

- 20 -

[was]  entitled  to  any  relief  whatsoever”).    We therefore  grant  Mother’s request  for  an 
award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred on appeal.

VIII.  Conclusion

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  affirm  the  judgment  of  the  trial  court.    We  grant 
Mother’s request for attorney’s fees and costs incurred on appeal and remand for the trial 
court  to  determine  the  reasonable  amount  of  same.    Costs  on  appeal  are  taxed  to  the 
appellant, Daniel William Creger.
