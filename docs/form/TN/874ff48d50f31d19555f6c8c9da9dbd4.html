      <pre>Memorial Resolution 
 In Honor of Judge Gerald Leighton Ewell, Sr. 

July 3, 1929 â€“ December 1, 2021 

June 2022 

 

 

The Honorable Judge Gerald Leighton Ewell, Sr. of Manchester, Tennessee, passed away 

on December 1, 2021.  He was born July 3, 1929, to Leighton Ewell and Elizabeth Jameson 

Ewell. He was predeceased by his loving wife Katherine Qualls Ewell, to whom he was married 

for over sixty years.  Judge Ewell is survived by a daughter, Amy Ewell Stout, a son Gerald L. 

Ewell, Jr., a grandson Sam Stout, and a granddaughter Kirby Stout Zora.  He was a member of 

the Main Street Church of Christ in Manchester. 

Judge Ewell attended public school in Manchester and Coffee County and was known to 

his friends as Jerry.  He graduated from Castle Heights Military Academy, in Lebanon, 

Tennessee, in 1947, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Vanderbilt University in 1951 and 

received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1953.  

While at Vanderbilt, he was a member of Omicron Delta Kappa honorary leadership fraternity, 

Beta Theta Pi social fraternity, Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity and lettered as equipment manager 

of the Vanderbilt football team.  He served as president of his law school fraternity, president of 

the Vanderbilt Law School student body and Chief Justice of the Vanderbilt Moot Court. 

Upon his graduation from Vanderbilt Law School, he entered the United States Navy, 

attended officer candidate school and was commissioned Ensign. He served honorably on active 

duty for over three years with various aviation squadrons as an air intelligence and JAG officer, 

doing one tour of duty in 1955 at sea in the Pacific Ocean with Air Task Group Two aboard the 

aircraft carrier USS Philippine Sea off the coasts of Korea, southeast China and in the Formosa 

Straits.  After active duty, Judge Ewell served six years in the active reserves as a JAG officer.  

He was commanding officer of his reserve unit and was discharged honorably in 1962 with the 

rank of Lieutenant (senior grade). 

Upon his return to Manchester in 1957 after his military service, he was appointed 

Assistant District Attorney and held that part-time position for fifteen years.  During his tenure as 

an Assistant District Attorney General, he was in the private practice of civil law with Harry B. 

Gilley and then with his father, Leighton Ewell.  In 1972, he was elected Circuit Court Judge for 

Coffee County, and served continuously for twenty-six years.  After retirement in 1998, he was 

designated by the Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court to serve as Circuit Judge in 

various counties in Tennessee and was called back to the bench by the Chief Justice to serve full 

time during the eighteen months of active duty in Iraq by his successor, the Honorable L. Craig 

Johnson.  Judge Ewell also served on occasion as a Criminal Court of Appeals Judge at the 

request of the Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. 

Judge Ewell was a member and President of the Manchester Rotary Club.  He served 

seven years on the Manchester Board of Education and two years a chairman.  For more than 

thirty years, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the First National Bank of 

Manchester, acting as secretary to the Board during much of his tenure.  

Judge Ewell was an avid ham radio operator, held an Amateur Extra Class license and 

received two public service awards from the American Amateur Radio Relay League.   As his 

hobbies, he enjoyed flying giant scale model airplanes and beekeeping, giving most of the honey 

he harvested to appreciative friends   

The Honorable Judge Gerald L. Ewell, Sr. was known to the lawyers who practiced 

before him and the litigants in his courtroom as a fair-minded, knowledgeable, well-prepared and 

courteous judge.  It is my very great honor to present this resolution in tribute to him 

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Tennessee Judicial Conference that the 

foregoing Memorial Resolution in honor of Gerald Leighton Sr., be entered on the minutes of 

this conference, that a copy be furnished to West Publishing Company for inclusion in Tennessee 

Decisions and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies thereof be furnished to members of his 

family. Respectfully submitted this 15th day of June, 2022.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
