      <pre>The 2012 Tennessee Pro Bono Report

Executive Summary

The efforts of the Tennessee Supreme Court and the Access to Justice Commission to
increase pro bono services and pro bono reporting are having an impact on
Tennessee’s licensed attorneys.

Based on information and statistics collected, attorneys have provided most of their pro
bono assistance by directly helping low-income Tennesseans with their legal needs.
Since commencement of the collection of statistics in 2009, Tennessee attorneys have
shown they are stepping up and responding to the civil legal needs gap by donating
more time to pro bono projects.

In 2011, the Access to Justice Commission recommended and the Tennessee Supreme
Court approved a streamlined Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form that has aided in the
reporting of pro bono activity hours by attorneys. Continuing its support of pro bono
reporting by attorneys, the Tennessee Supreme Court sent a letter to all licensed
attorneys in their 2012 annual attorney license renewal packets from the  Board of
Professional Responsibility, encouraging the voluntary reporting of pro bono hours. We
will be able to quantify the impact of this  encouragement when the 2012 reporting
statistics are available.

In 2011, 46.11% of Tennessee’s licensed attorneys reported 804,961 hours of pro bono
work, for an average of 82.68 hours per attorney reporting pro bono work. The pro bono
legal services were provided and reported in four categories:

! Legal services without a fee or at a substantially reduced fee to persons of

! Legal services without a fee to non-profit organizations serving persons of limited

limited means;

means;

! Legal services to groups and organizations at a reduced fee when payment of

standard fees would create a financial hardship; and

! Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, or the legal profession.

Since 2009, reported pro bono hours have increased dramatically. 

The Access to Justice Commission has established a goal of 50% of all licensed
attorneys providing at least 50 hours of pro bono service per year. Forty-six percent of
all attorneys voluntarily reported providing pro bono services during 2011. For those

who reported, the average number of pro bono services provided per attorney was
significantly higher than 50 hours during the year. In a short period of time, the
Commission has come close to achieving this goal.

The pro bono services reporting data for this report was obtained from the Tennessee
Board of Professional Responsibility. Surveys of organizations involved in providing
legal services or involved in providing non-legal services, such as mediation, to those
with legal issues were also completed.

The members of the Supreme Court of Tennessee and the Access to Justice
Commission, thank the Tennessee licensed attorneys, legal services organizations, bar
associations, mediators, judges, and all those involved in providing legal assistance or
working with those that provide legal assistance to low-income members of their
communities. You have made a difference and have made access to justice a reality for
many.

The 2012 Tennessee Pro Bono Report

This 2012 Tennessee Pro Bono Report contains information about and statistics on the
hours devoted to pro bono activities of legal aid providers, bar associations, law
schools, and individual attorneys in 2011. Comparisons with 2010 and 2009 statistics
have also been completed.

The following definitions apply to the breakdown of the reporting groups:

“All Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee regardless of the
location of their primary address

“All Government Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee and
employed by Tennessee state government regardless of the location of their primary
address

“All In-House Counsel” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee and
employed by a Tennessee employer as in-house counsel regardless of the location of
their primary address

“Out-of-State Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee whose
primary address is outside of Tennessee

“Out-of-State Government Attorneys” - all government attorneys licensed to practice law
in Tennessee whose primary address is outside of Tennessee

“Out-of-State In-House Counsel” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee,
employed as in-house counsel for a Tennessee employer, and whose primary address
is outside of Tennessee

“Tennessee Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee whose
primary address is in Tennessee

“Tennessee Government Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in
Tennessee whose primary address is in Tennessee

“Tennessee In-House Counsel” - all attorneys licensed to practice law in Tennessee,
employed as in-house counsel for a Tennessee employer and whose primary address is
in Tennessee

Attorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Statistics

The Tennessee Supreme Court adopted Supreme Court Rule 9, Section 20.11 on
November 2, 2009. The Rule requests that every attorney who is required to file an
Annual Registration Statement with the Board of Professional Responsibility (“BPR”)
voluntarily file a statement reporting the attorney’s pro bono service and activity during
the last calendar year. The Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form was first included in the
2010 BPR Registration Statement and reported data for the 2009 calendar year.

The Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to
require renewals on the first day of each attorney’s birth month. Under this new
procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until
all reporting for that year has been received.

The Access to Justice Commission now has pro bono reporting data for three calendar
years, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The Access to Justice Commission is pleased to provide
an analysis of the 2011 data and a comparison to that of the previous two years.

2011 Statistics

Pursuant to the Access to Justice Commission’s 2012 Strategic Plan, the Access to
Justice Commission is focused on pro bono work that aids Tennesseans. The 2011
statistics reflect pro bono work performed in 2011 and reported during the 2012 annual
registration period.

The 2011 reporting form asked for feedback from attorneys in four categories of pro
bono service.

1. Pro Bono Hours Reported by All Attorneys

The group of All Attorneys subject to the 2011 annual registration process totaled over
21,000 attorneys. Almost half of these attorneys reported pro bono hours.

3. Pro Bono Hours Reported by Tennessee Government Attorneys

For the first time in 2011, a request was made to the Board of Professional
Responsibility (“BPR”) for a breakdown of hours provided by Tennessee Government
Attorneys. The BPR also provided the number of attorneys who indicated they were in-
house counsel; however, we did not request that the BPR provide the number of hours
this category of attorneys provided. In the 2009 and 2010 data, the hours provided by
Tennessee Government Attorneys and Tennessee In-House Counsel were simply
included in total attorney hours noted in chart 2(b) above.

Overall Results

Access to justice cannot be achieved without collaboration. The multiple partners of the
Court and the Commission include but are not limited to the many volunteers on the
Commission's numerous committees and workgroups, attorneys, legal services
organizations, bar associations, law schools and law students, mediators, judges, and
countless volunteers involved in providing day-to-day assistance to those needing legal
services within their communities. The results of these efforts are over 800,000 pro
bono service hours reported in 2011.

Tennesseans have responded to the civil legal needs gap—they have donated time,
talent, and treasure to pro bono services, programs, and projects. They have provided
pro bono assistance by directly providing legal services at no cost or at substantially
reduced rates to low-income Tennesseans, by providing legal services to non-profit
organizations serving persons of limited means, by providing legal services to groups
and organizations at a reduced fee when payment of standard fees would create a
financial hardship, and by providing legal services to improve the law, the legal system,
or the legal profession.

The efforts of many have made a difference. Access to Justice has become a reality for
many low-income Tennesseans.

Additional Information, Data and Survey Highlights

Bar Association Pro Bono

Using www.surveymonkey.com, the Pro Bono Coordinator surveyed regional and local
bar associations about the pro bono initiatives and efforts sponsored by each bar
association. Bar association presidents were emailed a link to complete the survey. The
Pro Bono Coordinator followed up with phone calls and emails to encourage additional
responses.

To date, 33 responses were received from bar associations. Highlights and insights
obtained from some of the survey responses are listed below.

Many of the rural and some suburban bar associations do not have formal organized
pro bono programs but do accept referrals from their local legal aid offices.

Several bar associations noted specific pro bono initiatives or are working on developing
pro bono initiatives:

! Anderson County Bar Association has a need for pro bono volunteers to address

issues regarding access to healthcare (TennCare) and other benefits.

! Coffee County Bar Association is developing a pro bono packet to distribute to all
new members in an effort to recruit more participation in the bar. The packet will
educate new members on the benefits of participating in pro bono cases.

! Cumberland County Bar Association has members who have ideas for pro bono

projects and would like to partner with the Commission in these efforts.

! Henry County Bar Association hosts an annual event during which members

prepare wills, powers of attorney, and living wills for military and EMS personnel
in Henry, Benton, and Weakley counties.

! Knox County Bar Association created a Legal Legacy Project to pair law students
and newer attorneys with more experienced practitioners to handle pro bono
cases. The Knoxville Bar Association also introduced the Pillar Law Firm Model
to its members in October 2012. The Pillar Law Firm Model is an initiative to
increase the number of law firms/offices with pro bono policies for its members.

Law School Pro Bono

In its 2012 Strategic Plan, the Access to Justice Commission acknowledged the
importance of introducing pro bono services to future attorneys while they are still in law
school. The Access to Justice Commission was committed to convening meetings with
law school deans, law school pro bono directors, and students at least annually to
explore increasing the participation of law students in pro bono activities. The
Commission also compiled the pro bono policies of Tennessee law schools into one
document, a Pro Bono Policy Compilation, as a resource for Tennessee law schools
and for law schools nationwide.

The Tennessee Bar Association’s Law School Subcommittee of its Access to Justice
Committee conducted a survey of Tennessee law schools to develop a list of the pro
bono and clinical opportunities for law students. This Resource Inventory provides
details on the clinical programs offered by each school, formal law student pro bono
programs, informal law student pro bono opportunities, alumni pro bono opportunities,
and resources and support for public interest careers. The Access to Justice
Coordinator and the Pro Bono Coordinator contacted the law schools to gather
supplemental information to include in the Resource Inventory.

Resource Inventory Highlights

! Belmont College of Law: This school is the newest addition to the Inventory. All
Student Bar Association officers are required to perform 20 hours of public
interest work. Committee chairs and members of the committees must each
complete 10 hours of public interest work. Belmont Legal Aid Society members
pledge to complete 25 hours of public interest work per year.

! Duncan School of Law: Law students are required to complete 30 hours of pro
bono services to graduate. Each member of the faculty is required to complete
20 hours of pro bono per year to be considered for tenure.

! University of Tennessee: This law school offers seven different clinical programs.
UT Pro Bono, a student-run organization, handles pro bono projects with faculty
and administrative support. The University of Tennessee offers alumni pro bono
opportunities supervised by its Access to Justice Coordinator at the Career
Center and the Office of Development and Alumni Affairs. The University also
offers public interest fellowships, stipends, and loan repayment assistance to its
students.

-11-

! University of Memphis: The Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law offers four

different clinical programs: Child and Family Litigation, Civil Litigation, Elder Law
Clinic, and Housing Adjudication. The Public Action Law Society (PALS) is the
formal student pro bono program and it conducts an annual pro bono fair. The
law school is developing a system for alumni and local attorneys to request
student assistance in providing pro bono services to low-income residents.
Beginning in January 2013, students are required to complete 40 hours of pro
bono work to graduate.

! Vanderbilt University: This law school offers five different clinical programs. Pro
bono organizations include Vanderbilt Legal Aid Society and Law Students for
Social Justice. Externship programs, stipends for internships, and post-graduate
stipends are available, as well as loan repayment assistance.

Legal Service Providers – Legal Services Corporation (“LSC”)-Funded

In Tennessee, there are four legal aid providers that receive federal funding from the
Legal Services Corporation(“LSC”): Legal Aid of East Tennessee, Legal Aid Society of
Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, Memphis Area Legal Services, and West
Tennessee Legal Services. In October 2011, the Access to Justice Commission Chair
and the Access to Justice Coordinator met with the executive directors of these
organizations to begin an ongoing discussion about how the Access to Justice
Commission and the LSC-funded legal aid providers can collaborate to increase the pro
bono assistance provided by Tennessee attorneys. The Access to Justice Commission
Chair now holds quarterly conference calls with these directors.

According to federal regulations, LSC-funded legal aid providers must use at least 12.5
percent of their LSC funds for Private Attorney Involvement (pro bono). Each of the four
LSC-funded organizations has a Pro Bono Coordinator/Director. The coordinators
provide a wide range of services and interact with a variety of partners to provide
assistance to substantial numbers of clients. These services range from arranging
classic attorney-client representation to providing unbundled services. The coordinators
also provide support services for pro bono activities such as intake, referrals to a variety
of programs, continuing legal education, malpractice coverage, legal clinics, partnering
with bar associations to highlight the profession’s commitment to access to justice,
recognition activities, and numerous other activities.

General information gathered from the four LSC-funded organizations’ directors and
websites is provided below. A chart detailing pro bono opportunities and pro bono
statistics for the organizations is attached as Exhibit A.

Legal Aid of East Tennessee (LAET)

LAET has been part of the community structure of East Tennessee for over 40 years,
serving 26 counties from Hamilton County to Johnson County. LAET has six offices with
locations in Chattanooga, Maryville, Johnson City, Morristown, and two offices in
Knoxville (Family Justice Center and LAET office). There are Pro Bono Directors in the
Knoxville and Chattanooga offices.

Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands (LAS)

LAS serves 48 Tennessee counties with its eight offices: Clarksville, Columbia,
Cookeville, Gallatin, Murfreesboro, Nashville, Oak Ridge, and Tullahoma. To qualify for
assistance from the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands,
clients must be at least 60 years of age or from a low-income household. People living
outside the Nashville office’s service area are instructed to call the LAS office serving
their county to find out about pro bono opportunities. LAS has a full-time Pro Bono
Director in the Nashville office.

The Nashville office has the most pro bono resources. In addition to providing legal
counsel for nonprofit organizations, LAS will accept cases in the following areas:
domestic violence, family law, employment (federal income tax disagreements, wage
claims, discrimination, job training courses), health (TennCare, Medicaid, Medicare,
nursing home issues, living wills, powers of attorney), housing (Section 8 or public
housing, evictions, foreclosures, rental issues, unfair loans, homeowner counseling),
and money (illegal collection methods, bankruptcy, SSI, Families First, TANF, SNAP,
unemployment, simple wills for individuals over 60 years of age and the seriously ill).
LAS generally does not accept immigration issues or divorce cases unrelated to
domestic violence.

Memphis Area Legal Services (MALS)

MALS provides civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and the elderly in
southwestern Tennessee, anchored by its office in Memphis. Its Covington office serves
three smaller rural communities: Tipton, Fayette, and Lauderdale counties. MALS has a
full-time Pro Bono Coordinator. Priorities include cases involving issues related to family

-13-

and children, housing and real property, consumer issues, individual and civil rights,
health and income maintenance, and seniors.

West Tennessee Legal Services (WTLS)

WTLS serves Benton, Carroll, Chester, Crockett, Dyer, Decatur, Gibson, Hardeman,
Hardin, Haywood, Henry, Henderson, Lake, McNairy, Madison, Obion, and Weakley
counties. Its main office is in Jackson, with offices in Dyersburg, Huntingdon, and
Selmer. It has one part-time Pro Bono Director/Coordinator. WTLS accepts the following
types of civil cases: access to health/medical care, securing or retaining housing,
ensuring compliance with Fair Housing Laws, securing or retaining income, personal
freedom and security rights, parental rights with state action, rights of persons in
institutions, freedom of all persons from abuse, family issues, education rights,
consumer rights, and community education. WTLS does not accept cases with the
potential of a high monetary judgment or adult criminal cases.

Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC-Funded

In Tennessee, there are many legal service providers that do not receive funding from
the Legal Services Corporation. The Tennessee Access to Justice Commission
considers any organization that does not receive funding from the Legal Services
Corporation a non-LSC-funded legal service provider. Non-LSC-funded organizations
can serve segments of the population that LSC-funded providers cannot. Non-LSC-
funded organizations do not have to follow federal income guidelines to determine if a
person is eligible to receive legal services. 

The Commission has gathered data from the following non-LSC providers: Catholic
Charities of Tennessee, Community Legal Center, Compassionate Counsel, Disability
Law & Advocacy Center, Justice for Our Neighbors, Southeast Tennessee Legal
Services, Southern Migrant Legal Services, Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and
Sexual Violence, and Tennessee Volunteer Lawyers and Professionals for the Arts. A
chart detailing the pro bono opportunities and pro bono statistics of each provider is
attached as Exhibit B.

-14-

Mediation Center Pro Bono

In Tennessee, some counties have mediation centers offering free or reduced-fee
mediation services to people who cannot afford a mediator. The Administrative Office of
the Courts has limited funding from the General Assembly to assist mediation centers
that apply for and meet grant criteria. The grants are designed to help low-income
Tennesseans access mediation services.

The Commission has gathered data from the following mediation center providers:
Community Mediation Center, Community Reconciliation, Inc., Family Court Services of
East Tennessee, First Judicial District Court Clinic, Mediation Services of Putnam
County, Mid South Mediation Services, Nashville Conflict Resolution Center, and
Neighborhood Reconciliation Services.

A chart containing information about each provider, including its pro bono statistics, is
attached as Exhibit C.

Continuing Legal Education (“CLE”) Credit Attorneys Received for Pro Bono
Work in 2012

Supreme Court Rule 21, Section 4.07(c) permits the Continuing Legal Education
(“CLE”) Commission to give Ethics & Professionalism credit at the rate of one hour of
credit for every five billable hours of pro bono legal representation provided through
court appointment or an organized bar association program or legal services
organization, or of pro bono mediation services as required by Supreme Court Rule 31
or the Federal Court Mediation Programs.

As of March 1, 2013, the CLE Commission has posted 3,780.84 hours of CLE credit
given to attorneys for pro bono work done in 2012. This is the highest number of CLE
credit hours given since the Commission began collecting this data.

The Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services and the Tennessee Bar Association, with
support from the Tennessee Access to Justice Commission, has developed an online
legal resource that allows those with legal questions to email their questions to a central
website. (www.OnlineTNJustice.org). These questions are then answered by volunteer
attorneys. Information and statistics regarding this pro bono resource are below.

In addition to recruiting volunteer lawyers to handle full 
representation of clients in litigation and transactional 
matters, we offer the following clinics:  

 Advice Clinics are designed to assist clients who have 
questions about routine legal issues and do not require 
on-going representation.  We conduct at least three 
“Saturday Bar” Advice Clinics per month, and offer Clinics 
as part of special events sponsored by LAET or in 
collaboration with other social service providers.  In 2012, 
our Advice-Clinic program included large-scale clinics 
conducted as part of the ABA’s National Pro Bono 
Celebration in October.  These clinics (conducted in 
Athens, Chattanooga, Cleveland, Dunlap, Gruetli-Laager, 
Jasper, Knoxville, Madisonville, Maryville, Morristown, and 
Pikeville) served hundreds of low-income people.  We will 
have similar clinics in 2013. 

Brief-Service Clinics are for clients who need 
representation at routine hearings without requiring the 
volunteer to enter an appearance for extended

They are an evaluation team for the

When the litigants are highly contentious, 
the judges refer the parties to the Court 
Clinic for an evaluation. The Juvenile Court 
judge refers parents for mediation to the 
Court Clinic. They also have a Supervised 
Visitation program where they supervise 
approximately 50 hours of supervision 
ordered by the juvenile and domestic court 
judges.  Approximately 80-90% of the 
mediations result in settlement of the 
matter. 
They provide services including: Court

reached a contract and 95% of participants 
were satisfied with the process and results.

SYNOPSIS OF 2012 SERVICES 

FUTURE PLANS 

NEEDS/COMMENTS  

They would like to get 
some funding to offer 
reduced fee parent 
education for parents 
who want to stay 
together and have a 
great need for better 
communication skills. 

NCRC is at capacity with 
their existing 7 programs 
(and 7 staff - 3 full-time/3 
part-time). They do not 
plan to launch any new 
programs in 2013. 

Needs: They really 
need more funding, 
so as to not run out 
of money about two 
weeks before the end 
of each quarter. They 
don't need a lot 
more.....about $5,000 
to $8,000...would 
greatly decrease the 
stress. 

They need more 
financial resources, 
more recognition 
from the ATJC and 
the Tennessee 
Supreme Court that 
mediation IS 
resolving thousands 
of Tennesseans' legal 
issues/disputes, and 
more support from 
the legal and 
business world.  

They provide victim offender and 
community mediation to general sessions 
and juvenile courts in seven Middle 
Tennessee counties. They also provide 
support classes in conflict/anger 
management, teen substance abuse 
prevention, shoplifting, financial 
responsibility and parent mediation and 
education for separating parents.  Most of 
their mediation cases involve families so 
that has become their specialty.  All 
mediations are free.   
NCRC provides mediation services and 
conflict resolution education and training to 
diverse communities in Nashville. Court-
based mediations are provided free of 
charge, while community-based mediation 
services are subject to a sliding scale fee. 
More than 80% of all of NCRC's mediation 
referrals actually get mediated, and their 
rate of successfully completing mediations 
(with a full or partial written agreement) is 
90% 

NRS does victim-offender mediations.  All of 
their victim-offender mediations are 
provided for free.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
