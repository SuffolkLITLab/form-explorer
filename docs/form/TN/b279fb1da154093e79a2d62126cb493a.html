      <pre>Memorial Resolution 

Honorable Russell Lee Moore, Jr. 

        January 6, 1946 – January 28, 2022 

         June 2022 
 

On  January  6,  1946,  Russell  Lee  Moore,  Jr.  was  born  to  Dr.  Russell  Lee  Moore  and 

Dorothy Frances Jordan Moore in Dyersburg, Tennessee.  Except for the time he spent in college 

and law school, he was a lifelong resident of Dyersburg.  Lee graduated from Dyersburg High 

School  where  he  excelled  in  baseball,  football  and  basketball.  One  of  his  favorite  past  times 

involved  entertaining  listeners  with  stories  of  his  high  school  athletic  accomplishments.  Lee’s 

prowess earned him a place on the baseball team at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) under 

the legendary coach Tom Swayze. The team would go on to play in the College World Series with 

Lee’s help.  In fact, in his junior year of college, Lee led the Southeastern Conference in home 

runs. While in college, Lee was also a member of the Sigma Nu Fraternity. Throughout his life 

and career that followed, Lee would embody the Sigma Nu creed to “walk in the Way of Honor.”  

Upon graduation, Lee enrolled in the Ole Miss Law School while continuing to assist the 

baseball team as a coach.  His love of sports and Ole Miss in particular followed him well beyond 

his undergraduate years. He was a proud alumnus of Ole Miss and spoke with pride about his alma 

mater, remaining a passionate Ole Miss supporter and fan throughout his lifetime. For many years, 

he was a fixture at the Grove for football games or at Swayze Field for baseball games.  

After law school graduation, Lee returned home to practice law in Dyersburg in 1971. He 

began his legal career as an associate at the law firm of Ewell, Ewell and Farmer.  He remained at 

the same firm for nearly thirty years, eventually becoming a principal of the firm under a different 

name: Farmer, Moore, Jones, Hamilton and Lay. In 1997, Lee left private practice after he was 

appointed as Circuit Court Judge for the 29th Judicial District by Governor Don Sundquist. Lee 

served as Circuit Court Judge until his retirement on November 30, 2021. On the bench, Lee was 

known for being an ethical jurist with a measured and calm judicial demeanor. He wanted to do 

the right thing in every decision he made.  His exterior hid a heart of gold and a man who cared 

very much for the people who worked and served around him.  He always recognized the devoted 

work of all the court personnel who made the system run.  He made himself available to encourage 

and lend a helping hand to those who were learning to be trial judges. A worn, tattered paged filled 

Bible was a fixture on his desk, and he was quick to share the words contained therein to those 

who crossed his path.        

But the law was not Lee’s only passion. Lee loved the community where he grew up and 

continued to be involved in various ways throughout his life. For many years, he played in the 

men’s fast pitch softball league.  He also was a long-time member of the Dyersburg Rotary Club, 

serving as club president and was selected as a Paul Harris Fellow.  He proudly served as a member 

and chairman of the Dyersburg City School Board of Education, as well as being selected to the 

All Tennessee School Board in 1991. 

Lee was also devoted to his family. Lee married Janice Chitwood Moore on July 27, 1973.  

Two  children  were  born  of  this  union:    Captain  Russell  Lee  Moore  III  (Amy)  of  Jacksonville, 

Florida  and  Jordan  Willis  (Matthew)  of  Dyersburg.    Lee  and  Janice  were  blessed  with  4 

grandchildren, Adam Trethewey, Kyra Trethewey, Madelyn Moore and Harper Willis.  Lee passed 

from this earthly existence on January 28, 2022.  

Lee was a husband, a father, a Christian man, a student of the  Bible, and a  man of  the 

highest  integrity.    He  will  be  remembered  for  his  honesty,  his  humility,  and  his  remarkable 

kindness.  We will miss the sound of his voice, his stories, and his smile. Godspeed, Judge Lee 

Moore.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
