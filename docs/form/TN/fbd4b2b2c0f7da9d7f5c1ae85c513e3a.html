      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT NASHVILLE
Assigned on Briefs January 3, 2023

TEAL PROPERTIES, INC. v. DOG HOUSE INVESTMENTS, LLC, ET AL.

Appeal from the Circuit Court for Davidson County

No. 17C2547, 20C2239 Kelvin D. Jones, Judge

___________________________________

No. M2022-00128-COA-R3-CV
___________________________________

This appeal arises from a series of civil actions between a tenant and its landlord. The first
action resulted in a ruling that the landlord was “merely a sham or dummy corporation” 
and  “the  alter  ego”  of  its  sole  shareholder. See Dog  House  Investments,  LLC  v.  Teal 
Properties,  Inc.,  et  al., 448  S.W.3d  905,  911 (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2014). The  second  action 
resulted in a settlement agreement that entitled the prevailing party in future lease disputes 
to an award of related attorney’s fees. The third and present action commenced in 2017 
with  each  party  suing  the  other  on  various  grounds  in  different  courts.  Following  a 
consolidation of the pending actions, the case was tried by a jury, which ruled in favor of
the tenant, Dog House Investments, LLC, (“Dog House”) on the merits. Thereafter, Dog 
House filed a motion to recover its attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party pursuant 
to the 2014 settlement agreement, and the trial court awarded Dog House $292,168.84 in 
attorney’s fees and costs. This appeal followed. The sole issue on appeal is the amount of 
the attorney’s fees awarded. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm. Because Dog House 
is  also  entitled  to  recover  the  reasonable  and  necessary  attorney’s fees  it  incurred  in 
successfully defending this appeal, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.

House Investments, LLC.

OPINION

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Teal Properties, Inc., (“TPI”) is the owner of a 9,000 square foot office/warehouse 
space on Craighead Street in Nashville, Tennessee (“the Property”). Since 2008, TPI has 
leased the Property to Dog House. Dog House is a franchisee that operates “Camp Bow 
Wow  Nashville,” a  dog  day  care  and  boarding  facility. This  is  the  third  court  action 
between the parties related to their lease. 

Dog House initiated the first action in 2011,  alleging  that TPI breached the lease 
agreement by failing to submit insurance claims following a flood on the Property. See Dog 
House  Investments,  LLC  v.  Teal  Properties,  Inc.,  et  al.,  448 S.W.3d  905,  910  n.1,  911
(Tenn. Ct. App. 2014). Dog House also sought to pierce TPI’s corporate veil and hold its 
sole shareholder, Jerry L. Teal (“Mr. Teal”), personally liable. Id. The trial court ruled in 
favor of Dog House and found that TPI was “merely a sham or dummy corporation” and 
“the alter ego” of Mr. Teal. Id. We affirmed the judgment in all respects on appeal. Id. at 
918.

The second action between the parties commenced in May of 2014 when Dog House 
filed a declaratory judgment action against TPI and Mr. Teal. Shortly thereafter, TPI filed 
a detainer warrant, seeking to regain possession of the Property. After being consolidated,
those cases were resolved in  September 2014 when the parties entered into a settlement 
agreement that provided:

Should a dispute arise over the enforceability of or for breach or failure to 
perform  this  Agreement  or  the  Lease,  as  amended,  the  prevailing  party  in 
such dispute, shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all of 
its  costs,  expenses  and  attorney’s  fees,  related  to  such  a  dispute  and  the 
Lawsuit.

The  third  and  present  action  arose  in  October  2017 when  TPI  filed  a breach  of 
contract claim against Dog House.2 In response, Dog House asserted various claims against 
TPI and Mr. Teal.3 After Dog House prevailed on its motion for summary judgment and
                                           

2 TPI also named Steve Lassiter and Nancy Purvis, the owners of Dog House, as defendants. The 
trial court dismissed Lassiter and Purvis from the suit because they had no individual liability under the 
terms of the lease. Dog House was left as the sole defendant.

3 These included breach of lease claims against TPI and Mr. Teal for failing to repair the Property 

or reimburse Dog House for expenses incurred from floods in 2017, 2019, and 2020.

- 2 -

all issues presented to the jury, the trial court entered a final judgment against TPI and Mr. 
Teal, jointly and severally, in the amount of $100,403.08 plus $20,179.57 in prejudgment 
interest.  Pursuant  to  the  settlement agreement,  the  trial  court  also  awarded Dog  House
$292,168.64 in attorney’s fees and expenses as the prevailing party.

Mr. Teal timely filed a notice of appeal on his own behalf; however, no notice of 
appeal was filed on behalf of TPI. We note, however, that Mr. Teal, who is not a licensed 
attorney, purportedly filed an appellate brief on behalf of TPI. Tennessee law precludes a 
corporation’s  nonlawyer  officer  or  agent  from  representing  a  corporation  in  a  legal 
proceeding. Old Hickory Eng’g & Mach. Co. v. Henry, 937 S.W.2d 782, 786 (Tenn. 1996);
Bivins v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 910 S.W.2d 441, 447 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995) (“An attempted 
appeal  of  a  person  not  licensed  to  practice  law,  purporting  to  represent  another,  will  be 
dismissed.”); see  also Tenn.  Sup.  Ct.  R.  7,  §  1.01;  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  23-3-101. As  a 
consequence, the brief Mr. Teal attempted to file on behalf of TPI is a nullity.4

Accordingly,  TPI  is  not  a  party  to  this  appeal.  As  a  consequence,  the  judgment 

against TPI is res judicata.

Mr.  Teal  raises  one  issue  on  appeal:  Did  the  trial court abuse  its  discretion  by 

awarding Dog House $292,168.84 in attorney’s fees?

ISSUES

STANDARD OF REVIEW

Because  a  trial court has  the  discretion  to  determine  whether  to  award  attorney’s
fees, reviewing courts will uphold that determination unless it finds that the trial court has 
abused its discretion. Wright ex rel. Wright v. Wright, 337 S.W.3d 166, 176 (Tenn. 2011) 
(citing Kline v Eyrich, 69 S.W.3d 197, 203 (Tenn. 2002)). “Thus, reviewing courts will set 
aside a discretionary decision only when the court that made the decision applied incorrect 
legal standards, reached an illogical conclusion, based its decision on a clearly erroneous 
assessment  of  the  evidence,  or  employs  reasoning  that  causes  an  injustice  to  the 

                                           

4 Mr. Teal also attempted to file a motion on behalf of Teal Properties, Inc.  In an order entered on 

August 25, 2022, this court struck the motion. The order reads in pertinent part: 

Allowing Mr. Teal to file a motion on behalf of Teal Properties, Inc. would be permitting 
the unauthorized practice of law. Filings by a person not entitled to practice law purporting 
to represent another are a nullity. Vandergriff v. Park Ridge East Hosp., 482 S.W.3d 545, 
554 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015) (quoting Bivins v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 910 S.W.2d 441, 447 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  1995)).  It  is, therefore,  ordered  that  the  motion  filed  on  behalf  of  Teal 
Properties, Inc. is stricken.

complaining party.” Konvalinka v. Chattanooga-Hamilton Cnty. Hosp. Auth., 249 S.W.3d 
346, 358 (Tenn. 2008).

In Tennessee, there is no “fixed mathematical rule” for a court to determine what is 
reasonable. Wright, 337 S.W.3d at 176 (quoting Killingsworth v. Ted Russell Ford, Inc., 
104 S.W.3d 530, 534 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009)). Ultimately, “the trial court’s determination 
of reasonable attorney’s fee is a ‘subjective judgment based on evidence and the experience 
of the trier of facts.’” Id. (quoting United Med. Corp. of Tenn., Inc. v. Hohenwald Bank & 
Trust  Co.,  703 S.W.2d  133,  137  (Tenn.  1986)).  Accordingly,  reviewing  courts  may  not 
“merely  substitute  its  judgment  for  that  of  the  trial court.”  Myint  v.  Allstate  Ins.  Co., 
970 S.W.2d 920, 927 (Tenn. 1998).

ANALYSIS

I. ATTORNEY’S FEES AWARDED BY THE TRIAL COURT

Mr. Teal does not dispute that Dog House is entitled to attorney’s fees, but he takes 
issue  with the  amount  of  fees awarded and the  trial court’s  rationale  supporting  that 
amount. Mr. Teal argues that the trial court awarded attorney’s fees without inquiring into 
the  reasonableness  and  necessity  of  the  services  that  Dog  House’s  attorneys  performed. 
Mr.  Teal  also  contends  that  it  was  unnecessary  for  Dog  House  to  have  four  competent 
attorneys working on this case.

Dog  House  responds  that  Mr.  Teal  waived  these  issues  on  appeal  by  not  raising 
them  in the  trial court.  Moreover,  Dog  House  contends  that Mr.  Teal’s arguments  are 
meritless because the trial court made sufficient findings in its final order.

It is not the duty of an appellate court to research or construct a party’s argument. 
Newcomb v. Kohler Co., 222 S.W.3d 368, 401 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006) (citing United States
v. Berkowitz, 927 F.2d 1376, 1384 (7th Cir. 1991)). Rather, it is the duty of the appellant, 
in  constructing  his  or  her  brief,  to  include  “citations  to  the  authorities  and  appropriate 
references to the record.” Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(A). Similarly, Rule 6 of the Rules of 
the Court of Appeals of Tennessee requires litigants to include citations to the record when 
alleging what errors the trial court committed, how the errors were raised to the trial court, 
how the errors resulted in prejudice, and statements or assertions of determinative fact. If 
a party fails to cite any authority or construct an argument supporting the issue, then the 
party waives the issue on appeal. Newcomb, 222 S.W.3d at 401; see also Bean v. Bean, 
40 S.W.3d  52,  55–56  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2000)  (citations  omitted)  (“Courts  have  routinely 
held  that  the  failure  to  make  appropriate  references  to  the  record  and  to  cite  relevant 
authority  in  the  argument  section  of  the  brief as  required  by  Rule  27(a)(7)  constitutes  a 
waiver of the issue.”).

This court is mindful that pro se litigants “are entitled to fair and equal treatment by 
the courts.” Cannistra v. Brown, No. M2021-00833-COA-R3-CV, 2022 WL 4461772, at 

- 4 -

*4 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 26, 2022) (citing Vandergriff v. ParkRidge E. Hosp., 482 S.W.3d 
545, 551 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015)). However, pro se litigants may not “shift the burden of 
litigating their case to the courts.” Id. (citing Whitaker v. Whirlpool Corp., 32 S.W.3d 222, 
227 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000)). Moreover, pro se litigants still must largely comply with Rule 
27(a)’s requirements. Murray v. Miracle, 457 S.W.3d 399, 404 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2014). “In 
considering  appeals  from  pro  se  litigants,  the  court  cannot  write  the  litigants’  briefs  for 
them, create arguments, or ‘dig through the record in an attempt to discover arguments or 
issues that [they] may have made had they been represented by counsel.’” Cannistra, 2022 
WL 4461772, at *4 (quoting Murray, 457 S.W.3d at 402).

On December 3, 2021, Dog House filed a motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to the 
2014 settlement agreement. After the trial court set a hearing on Dog House’s motion for 
attorney’s fees, Mr. Teal filed a response in opposition to the motion to award Dog House 
its attorney’s fees.5 He also asked that the hearing be postponed because he would be unable 
to  attend  due  to “extreme  neuropathy  in  [his] feet,  which  is  caused  by  latent  insulin 
dependent diabetes.” Ostensibly, Mr. Teal could not walk.

In order to accommodate Mr. Teal, the trial court provided Mr. Teal with a Zoom 
link so he could virtually participate in the hearing. When the motion came on for hearing 
as scheduled, Mr. Teal failed to appear in person or virtually. The trial court waited for 
more  than  an  hour  before  hearing  the  motion without  Mr.  Teal’s  participation. In  the 
interim,  the  trial  court  called  Mr.  Teal  three  times  and  left  Mr.  Teal  two  messages  that 
included a phone number to call to be added to the Zoom hearing. Mr. Teal never called 
into the Zoom hearing. Mr. Teal did, however, email the trial court to inform the court that 
he would not be participating. The hearing then proceeded without Mr. Teal’s participation.

In  its  order  regarding  attorney’s  fees, the  trial  court  found  Paragraph  10  of  the 
Settlement Agreement to be binding on the parties.6 The trial court also concluded that Dog 

                                           

5 The  response,  which  addressed  more  than  Dog  House’s  request  for  attorney’s  fees,  was  titled 
“MOTION  TO  DENY  DEFENDANTS  EXPEDITED  HEARING  ON  DOG  HOUSE’S  MOTION  TO 
SPECIALLY  SET  TEAL’S  MOTION  TO  REVIEW  PREVIOUSLY  DENIED  MOTION  FOR  NEW 
TRIAL AND DISBURSEMENT OF BOND FUNDS.” Within this response, Mr. Teal identified paragraph 
5  as  follows:  “Pursuant  to  Local  Rule  26.04,  Plaintiff  Jerry  Teal  submits  the  following  response  to  the 
Motion  for  Entry  of  Order  Awarding  Attorney’s  Fees  and  Costs  (the  “Motion”)  filed  by  John  Brad 
Scarbrough and Greg Oakley. The specific grounds upon which the Motion is opposed are stated below.”

6 The trial court also noted that, prior to the jury trial, the parties stipulated that the trial court would 
determine who was the prevailing party, who was entitled to attorney’s fees, and the appropriate amount of 
attorney’s fees to be awarded.

- 5 -

House was “without question” the prevailing  party in this dispute and was contractually 
entitled to attorney’s fees.

After considering the relevant factors in Connors v. Connors, 594 S.W.2d 672, 677 
(Tenn. 1980) and Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 7, RPC 1.5, the trial court expressed in 
its analysis that

[t]he time, labor and skill necessary in order to litigate [this case] favors the 
award requested, as much of the time and labor required was necessary due 
to  TPI  and  Mr.  Teal’s  litigation  tactics,  which  unnecessarily  increased  the 
time and cost of the instant litigation. By taking on the representation of Dog 
House in litigating these cases and having to try the consolidated cases before 
a Jury over several days, such employment precluded the attorneys for Dog 
House  from  taking  on  other  employment.  The  amount  involved  and  the 
results  obtained  also  favored  an  award  of  the amount of  fees  requested  by 
Dog House. Not only did Dog House successfully defend against two cases 
filed  by  TPI  against  Dog  House  for  breach  of  the  Lease  and  to  evict  Dog 
House, but Dog House also prevailed on its counterclaims brought in both 
cases, and has obtained an award of more than $100,000 in damages, plus 
prejudgment interest.

In  reaching  the  $292,168.84  total,  the  trial  court  found  that  the  total  amount  of 
attorney’s  fees  sought  was  appropriate  because  Dog  House’s  attorneys’  hourly  rates 
ranging from $225 to $400 were commensurate with the rates charged by other Nashville 
attorneys with roughly twenty to thirty years of legal experience. The trial court noted that 
the reason why so many hours had been expended in this case is “self-evident and can be 
gleaned from the many filings, motion hearings, jury trial and post-trial motions.”

After reviewing Mr. Teal’s brief, we have determined that it is profoundly deficient 
in several respects. While Mr. Teal quotes case law and the relevant Rule of the Tennessee 
Supreme Court in laying the foundation for an argument, he does not point this court to 
concrete  examples  or  record  citations  that  indicate which  services  were unnecessary  or 
which fees were unreasonable. Rather, Mr. Teal’s argument merely finds fault with what 
he considers a lack of inquiry on the part of the trial court. This is readily evident from a 
review of Mr. Teal’s argument which we quote below.

After quoting from Connors v. Connors, 594 S. W.2d 672, and Tennessee Supreme 

Court Rule 8, Mr. Teal’s appellate argument reads as follows:

Two  issues  affect  the  assessment  of  fees.  The  record  in  this  case  is 
convoluted, involving three cases between the parties — a 2014 litigation, a 
2017  litigation,  and  a  2020  litigation.  The  Appellee  had  four  attorneys 
involved,  all  with  varying  degrees  of  experience  and  expertise,  to  wit: 
Attorney Oakley had been practicing law for 28 years, Attorney Knight for 

- 6 -

25 years, Attorney Scarbrough for 21 years and Attorney Holleman for 19 
years. Considering the skill level of these attorneys, was it necessary to have 
multiple  attorneys  with  this  level  of  competence  to  work  on  this  case  and 
whether the services overlapped. 

The Appellant cannot take issue if these licensed members of the Tennessee 
Bar expended the time and effort as set forth in their respective affidavits. 
What  the  Connors  decision  failed  to  consider  as  one  of  the  factors  was 
whether  all  of  the  services  were  reasonable  under  the  circumstances? 
Everyone has heard the analogy of how many people does it take to change 
a light bulb. With four attorneys involved, the trial court should have made 
an inquiry as to the reasonableness of services performed. The four attorneys 
may have very well culled out duplicative services, but the record is void of 
such  an  inquiry.  Instead,  the  trial  court  rubber  stamped  the  Appellee's 
attorney's fee declaration. Further evidence of this is found in the body of the 
state court order where a carte blanche claim of four hours for the drafting of 
the order, without any itemization.

The Connors decision also failed to address an additional issue whether the 
services  were  necessary  to  the  outcome  of  the  litigation.  Necessity  is  the 
hallmark of the determination of attorney's fees. A study of intellectual law 
might  be  a  fascinating  inquiry,  but  it  is  totally  irrelevant  to  this  litigation. 
With three different cases in controversy, the trial court bypassed its inherent 
obligation  to  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  fees  awarded  to  the 
Appellee’s counsel.

In conclusion, the trial court made no inquiry as to the fees awarded to the 
Appellee's  counsel.  Instead,  these  fees  were  approved  with  no  oversight. 
How can an award of attorney's fees be justified if a court does not take even 
the  rudimentary  steps  to  inquire.  For  the  reasons  outlined  herein,  this  case 
must be remanded to the trial court for further review.

Because Mr. Teal is proceeding pro se in this appeal, we “afford some degree of 
leeway” in considering Mr. Teal’s arguments. Cannistra, 2022 WL 4461772, at *4 (citing 
Young v. Barrow, 130 S.W.3d 482, 491 (Tenn. 2015)). But it is not the duty of this court 
to scour the record, which includes 100-plus pages of billing records, in search of services 
by Dog House’s attorneys that may have been duplicative, excessive, or unwarranted. If 
we  were  to  do  so,  we would  be  assuming Mr.  Teal’s burden  of  creating  a  factually 
integrated argument. See id. (quoting Murray, 457 S.W.3d at 402) (“In considering appeals 
from pro se litigants, the court cannot write the litigants’ briefs for them, create arguments, 
or ‘dig through the record in an attempt to discover arguments or issues that [they] may 
have made had they been represented by counsel.’”).  Instead, it is the duty of the appellant, 
in  constructing  his  or  her  brief,  to  include  “citations  to  the  authorities  and  appropriate 

- 7 -

references to the record.” Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(A). It is not the duty of an appellate 
court to research or construct a party’s argument. See Newcomb, 222 S.W.3d at 401.

Due to Mr. Teal’s omission of any citations to the record or factual support for his 
arguments, he has waived his right to appeal the amount of attorney’s fees awarded. See 
Newcomb, 222 S.W.3d at 401 (“The failure of a party to cite to any authority or to construct 
an argument regarding his position on appeal constitutes waiver of that issue.”).

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in all respects. 

II. ATTORNEY’S FEES INCURRED ON APPEAL

Dog House seeks to recover the reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees incurred 
in connection with this appeal and requests this court to remand the case to the trial court
for a determination of the appropriate amount of fees.

Contractual agreements for attorney’s fees “must be enforced as written regardless 
of whether parties are before a trial court or an appellate court.” Eberbach v. Eberbach, 
535 S.W.3d  467,  478  (Tenn.  2017). Courts  must  enforce  “the  terms  of  the  parties’ 
agreement  govern[ing]  the  award  of  fees . . . to  the  extent  the  agreement  demands.”  Id.
When a party is entitled to an award of appellate attorney’s fees, we may grant the request 
and set the amount or grant the request and remand to the trial court to set the amount. See 
Killingsworth v. Ted Russell Ford, Inc., 205 S.W.3d at 411 n.2.

The 2014 Settlement Agreement reads: 

Should a dispute arise over the enforceability of or for breach or failure to 
perform  this  Agreement  or  the  Lease,  as  amended,  the  prevailing  party  in 
such dispute, shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all of 
its costs, expenses and attorney’s fees, related to such dispute.

This action undoubtedly “arises” out of the lease, and Dog House is the prevailing 
party on appeal. Accordingly, we remand this issue to the trial court to award Dog House 
its reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees and costs incurred on appeal.

IN CONCLUSION

The  judgment  of  the  trial  court  is  affirmed  in  all  respects, and  this  matter  is 
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs of appeal are assessed 
against Jerry L. Teal for which execution may issue.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
