judicial programs.  The Judicial Branch shall conduct its services, 
programs or activities, when viewed in their entirety, in a manner that is 
readily accessible to and usable by qualified individuals with disabilities.   

I. 

Procedures: 

A. 

 
B. 

C. 

D. 

Upon request, the Tennessee Judicial Branch will provide 
reasonable modifications to its rules, policies, services, procedures, 
and practices when doing so is necessary to provide effective 
access to a qualified individual with a disability.  A “reasonable 
modification” may include, but is not limited to, furnishing, at no 
charge, auxiliary aids and services, which include but are not 
limited to equipment, devices, materials in alternative formats, and 
qualified interpreters or readers; and relocating judicial programs, 
services or activities to alternate accessible facilities or alternate 
accessible sites.  Such modifications shall be designed to make 
each service, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, 
readily accessible to be usable by a qualified individual with a 
disability. 

In the event that the reasonable modification requires relocation of 
a judicial program, service or activity to an alternate facility or site, 
the alternate facility or site shall comply with the requirements of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Tennessee Public 
Buildings Accessibility Act.  The alternate facility or site shall also 
comply with Tennessee law concerning the location of county 
courthouses. 

The Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator in a county where the 
county courthouse is not ADA compliant, shall maintain a list of 
alternate facilities or sites that may be used for relocation of judicial 
programs, services and activities.  An up to date copy of the 
alternate facility or site list shall be submitted to the Tennessee 
Judicial Program ADA Coordinator. 
 
The Tennessee Judicial Branch has Judicial Program ADA 
Coordinator, employed by the Administrative Office of the Courts 
(AOC), who oversees the administration of this policy, any 
complaints associated with issues raised by this policy, and 
Requests for Modification under the Americans with Disabilities Act 
within the Judicial Branch, and will have the ultimate responsibility 
for compliance with this policy.   

The Tennessee Judicial Program ADA Coordinator will designate a 
Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator for each county in a 
judicial district, who will be responsible for handling all Requests for 
Modification to access judicial programs, activities and services 
within that county.  The Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator

should be involved with or familiar with the judicial program of the 
county.   

 

Persons requiring modification to obtain access to judicial 
programs, services or activities at any facility used for such 
purposes should contact the Local Judicial Program ADA 
Coordinator (Coordinator).  A written Request for Modification is 
preferred.  However, this request may be made by telephone to the 
Coordinator.  In such instances, the Coordinator shall commit such 
requests to writing.  The Coordinator shall maintain a record of all 
Requests for Modification.  A Request for Modification form is 
available and may be obtained from the Local Judicial Program 
ADA Coordinator, the Tennessee Judicial Program ADA 
Coordinator, any court clerk’s office, or online at www.tncourts.gov.  
If appropriate or upon request, the Local Judicial Program ADA 
Coordinator or the Tennessee Judicial Program ADA Coordinator 
will provide assistance with writing and submitting the written 
request for Modification.  Large print and Braille versions of the 
Request form are available upon request.  If appropriate, other 
personnel associated with the judicial program, service or activity 
may assist the applicant in the submission of a completed Request 
for Modification to the Coordinator. 

The written Request for Modification shall include a description of 
the person’s disability, the role of the person in the judicial 
proceeding, the Modification sought, the date and time of the 
Modification requested, and the judicial proceeding for which the 
Modification is sought.  Once a Request for Modification has been 
granted, the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator will advise 
the applicant of the procedure to be followed with regard to 
subsequent proceedings associated with the original Request.  If 
necessary, the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator may 
require the applicant to provide additional information about the 
qualifying disability in order to determine the appropriate 
Modification to meet the applicant’s needs, but only such 
information that may be required to make such a determination.  
Under no circumstances will the Local Judicial Program ADA 
Coordinator be permitted to request information regarding the 
applicant’s disability that is not necessary for the evaluation of the 
Modification requested. 

An application requesting Modification may be submitted by any 
lawyer, party, witness, juror or other individual with an interest in 
attending any judicial program, activity or service or another person 
on behalf of such interested person. 

The Request for Modification should be submitted with as much 
advance notice as possible, but in any event should be made no 
less than five (5) business day prior to the date for which the

Modification is sought.  An immediate Request for Modification 
should be made when urgent and/or emergency circumstances 
arise.  In criminal cases where a defendant is confined to jail, the 
Request for Modification should be made as soon as possible.  
However, it may be necessary that the Request for Modification 
may be made contemporaneously with his or her initial court 
appearance. 

In the event that a person requiring a Modification has not made a 
timely Request for Modification, the court may, in its discretion, 
immediately grant such Modification without requiring an advance 
written request.  In such a case, a Request for Modification form 
shall be completed by either the person requesting Modification or 
court personnel for the court’s records.  Alternately, the court may, 
in its discretion, postpone, reschedule or otherwise delay the 
judicial program, service or activity affected.  Under such 
circumstances, the individual requesting Modification shall be 
required to immediately submit a written request.  If appropriate or 
upon request, court personnel will provide assistance with writing 
and submitting the request for Modification. 

The Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator will, as soon as 
practicable, notify the requesting individual of the Modification to be 
provided.  An alternate Modification may be offered instead of the 
requested Modification if the Local Judicial Program ADA 
Coordinator determines that another equally effective Modification 
is available. 

If the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator determines that 
additional time may be necessary in order to achieve and/or obtain 
Modification, the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator shall 
notify the judge presiding over the matter, who will determine an 
appropriate course of action.

A request for Modification may be denied only if the Local Judicial 
Program ADA Coordinator finds that:

4) 

The  person  making  the  request  is  not  a  qualified  individual 
with a disability; or, 

The requested Modification would create an undue financial

The  requested  Modification  would  fundamentally  alter  the 
nature of the judicial program, service or activity; or, 

Some  other  Modification  would  be  as  effective  and  involve 
less cost or inconvenience; or,

No employee of the Judicial Branch of the State of Tennessee shall 
retaliate against any person who exercises his/her rights under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act or who requests modification 
pursuant to this policy. 

 

If a Request for Modification is denied or the offered alternate 
Modification is unsatisfactory to the applicant, the applicant may 
appeal the decision of the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator 
to the presiding judge of the judicial district within ten (10) days of 
the denial of Modification or offer of alternate Modification. The 
judge shall rule on the appeal as soon as practicable, and where 
possible, in advance of the date of the hearing for which the 
Modification is requested. 

If an applicant is dissatisfied with the ruling of the presiding judge, 
the decision may be appealed, within ten (10) days of the ruling, to 
the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, or his/her 
designee.  A written request must include reasons for disagreement 
with the previous determinations, as well as the remedy sought. 
The Director shall provide a ruling as to the request as 
expeditiously as possible.  In resolving appeals, the Director is 
authorized to independently investigate the facts surrounding the 
appeal and has the discretion to utilize appropriate dispute 
resolution processes or other methods, including but not limited to, 
designating an appropriate neutral to assist in resolving the issues 
in controversy. 

A public notice shall be posted in visible places throughout each 
facility where judicial programs, services and/or activities are held, 
including but not limited to each court clerk’s office, that identifies 
the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator and the Tennessee 
Judicial Program ADA Coordinator.  Such public notice shall also 
provide a website address where a copy of this policy, 
implementation guidance, and Request for Modification form may 
be obtained electronically. 

 

Should the courthouse facility within which judicial programs, 
services and/or activities are provided be inaccessible, a public 
notice shall be posted on the outside of the building or at another 
such location at or near the building that is readily accessible.

service or activity is issued, said documents shall provide notice of 
the identity of the Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinator, the 
Tennessee Judicial Program ADA Coordinator and a specific 
designation as to how each may be contacted, including telephone 
numbers and email addresses.  Such notice shall also provide 
information about program accessibility and the procedure for 
submission of requests for reasonable modifications.  Such notice 
shall also provide a website address where a copy of this policy 
and Request for Modification request form may be obtained 
electronically.  In the alternative, an abbreviated form of notice, i.e. 
a stamped or printed statement, that may be integrated onto a pre-
printed form, may be provided on such documents that provides 
contact information for persons requiring assistance under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, e.g. “For ADA assistance, please 
call (insert contact information for Local Judicial Branch ADA 
Coordinator).”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
