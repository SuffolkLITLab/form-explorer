      <pre>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF TENNESSEE
AT JACKSON
June 28, 2022 Session

JANET GRAHAM v. UT REGIONAL ONE PHYSICIANS INC.

Appeal from the Circuit Court for Shelby County
No. CT-000808-18 Felicia Corbin Johnson, Judge
___________________________________

No. W2020-01736-COA-R3-CV
___________________________________

This appeal concerns the trial court’s decision to dismiss an action under Tennessee Rule 
of Civil Procedure 34A.02 and the doctrine of unclean hands. The plaintiff is a Certified 
Registered Nurse Anesthetist who alleges that she was harassed and discriminated against 
while working for the defendant, a prominent physician group in Memphis, Tennessee. The 
trial court found that dismissal was warranted because the plaintiff “willfully deleted text 
messages from her personal electronic devices after being placed on notice regarding her 
preservation  obligations,  resulting  in  the  deletion,  and  therefore  spoliation,  of  critical 
evidence that cannot be recovered.” This appeal followed. We conclude that the doctrine 
of unclean hands does not apply in this case because the plaintiff’s misconduct relates to 
the  litigation  as  a  whole,  not  to  her  claims.  Nonetheless,  we  also  conclude  that  the  trial 
court did not exceed its discretion by dismissing the case as a sanction for the plaintiff’s 
intentional spoliation of evidence under Rule 34A.02.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY1

Janet  Graham  (“Plaintiff”)  worked  as  a  Certified  Registered  Nurse  Anesthetist 
(“CRNA”) for UT Regional One Physicians, Inc. (“Defendant”) at Regional One Medical 
Center in Memphis, Tennessee. As a CRNA, Plaintiff provided anesthesia to patients under 
the supervision of Defendant’s anesthesiologists.

Plaintiff commenced the present action in February 2018 while still employed by 
Defendant. In the complaint, Plaintiff asserted claims for discrimination, harassment, and 
retaliation under the Tennessee Human Rights Act (“the THRA”), Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-
21-101  to  -702.2 Plaintiff  alleged that  Defendant,  through  its  agents  and  employees, 
“engaged  in  purposeful,  concerted  effort  to  create,  allow  and  perpetuate  systemic 
discriminatory practices and hostile work environment based on gender (female).”

Among the employees identified in the complaint was Defendant’s former head of 
anesthesiology, Dr. Lebron Cooper. Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that Dr. Cooper yelled at 
her  and  told  her  that  she  and  the  other  CRNAs  deserved  to  be  fired  for  “doing  things” 
without their attending physicians. But during discovery, Plaintiff produced a text message 
in which she claimed that Dr. Cooper’s outburst was part of her “plan . . . to make him lose 
his shit.” Plaintiff’s text messages further revealed that she had misled Defendant during a 
pre-suit investigation into her allegations.

At  her  deposition in  February  2019,  Defendant’s  counsel  asked  Plaintiff  if  she 
thought the text messages were grounds for termination. Plaintiff said that she “wouldn’t 
have turned [the messages] in” if she did, and she asserted that that she “could have deleted 
[the  messages]  a  long  time  ago  before  [she]  even  knew  about  a  lawsuit.”  But  Plaintiff
expressly denied deleting any text messages after filing her complaint. The week after her 
deposition, Defendant terminated Plaintiff’s employment.3

                                           

1 The factual history is taken from the allegations in the complaint. Because this case was dismissed 
by the trial court upon Defendant’s motion to dismiss, we presume that the allegations are true and give 
Plaintiff the “benefit of all reasonable inferences.” See Webb v. Nashville Area Habitat for Human., Inc., 
346 S.W.3d 422, 426 (Tenn. 2011).

2 Plaintiff also asserted a claim for violation of the Tennessee Public Protection Act, Tenn. Code 

Ann. § 50-1-304. Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed that claim in July 2018.

3 Plaintiff has not asserted a claim for wrongful termination.

- 2 -

In early March 2019, Defendant submitted a third set of interrogatories that asked 
Plaintiff to identify, inter alia, all “potentially relevant” text messages that she “destroyed, 
deleted, or otherwise disposed of, either before or after retaining counsel.” 

that  she  had  “deleted  several 

Plaintiff submitted her answers one month later, on April 8, 2019. Contradicting her 
deposition  testimony—in  which  she  denied  deleting  text  messages  after  filing  suit in 
text  message 
February  2018—Plaintiff  admitted 
conversations from her phone in or about August or September 2018.” But Plaintiff could 
not recall “with whom these messages were exchanged, their specific content, or the exact 
date on which they were deleted.” Plaintiff also admitted to deleting “approximately three 
to four text messages she exchanged with her mother, Ms. Cyndi Craft, notifying her of 
Plaintiff’s  termination”  as  well  as  “three  to  four  text  messages  she  exchanged  with  her 
sister, Ms. Jaime Henson, notifying her of Plaintiff’s termination” in late February or early 
March 2019.

A  subsequent  inspection  of  Plaintiff’s  cell  phone  revealed  that  she  had,  in fact, 

deleted over 200 messages in March 2019 alone. Of those, all but 50 were recovered.

In July 2019, Defendant moved to dismiss the case under the doctrine of unclean 
hands  and  Tennessee  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  34A.02.  Plaintiff  opposed  the  motion, 
arguing that Defendant was not prejudiced by the spoliation because most of the messages 
were recovered. Moreover, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that the remaining 50 messages were 
irrelevant because they were photos that Plaintiff sent to herself for a genealogy project; 
however, Plaintiff presented no evidence to prove the contents of the missing messages.

At  a  hearing  in  March  2019,  the  trial  court  announced  that  it  was  going  to  grant 

Defendant’s motion and dismiss the case with prejudice:

[L]ooking at all the factors, all the evidence that I have heard, the statements 
that  she  made  in  her  deposition,  the—you  know,  not  being  truthful  on  her 
written  discovery,  deleting  messages  after  the  deposition,  going  through 
extensive exercise to try to recover, some of which were recoverable, some 
of which were not, the defendant is entitled to have all relevant information 
to defend their case. And it just seems to me that it would be unfairly, unduly 
prejudicial to the defendants to have to come in and defend their clients on a 
claim that is being made by your client, and she’s not been truthful. That—
you know, and I have given her the benefit of the doubt from the point that 
she took a deposition, but what about the files that were deleted prior to her 
deposition when she decided to file her case? Many of those have not been 
recovered. We don’t know what they included.

So I think I narrowed it down to the time that she had her deposition 
because I’m thinking, well, you know, if there really wasn’t any—you know, 

- 3 -

if she hadn’t deleted anything or if they could be recovered, then, okay, you 
know, I can give that more weight because she was clearly on notice. You 
know, I’m trying to give her every benefit of the doubt because sometimes 
parties don’t know. Sometimes they misunderstand their lawyers or they’re 
not clear what their responsibility is. But in this case she was absolutely clear 
what her responsibility was or she should have been clear once you took her 
deposition.  It  was  her  responsibility  to  know,  and  it  was  her  attorney’s 
responsibility to advise her not to delete anything. And if so, that she needed 
to get with her lawyers before she did that. Apparently that didn’t happen.

So while she has—you know, while this Court has said time and time 
and time again that I always prefer that clients have their day in court, that 
the courthouse be open, that their cases are decided by—on the merits, not 
disposed—you  know,  summarily  dismissed,  I’m  not  so  sure  under  these 
circumstances that your client should have the right to have her case heard 
before a jury of her peers because of her conduct.

I think that it’s been very prejudicial to the defendant, and because we 
are not able to recover, we have no idea of knowing what is out there. We 
can’t  necessarily  assume  that—again  that  they’re  genealogy  documents. 
They  could  be  files  that  she  copied  from  her  employer.  Images  of  other 
emails or texts or—we just have no way of knowing.

.

.

.

.

. . . [T]he  communications,  whether  they’re  images  or  actual  messages, 
they’re  gone.  There’s no  way  to  recover  them.  So  for  those  reasons,  I’m 
going to grant the motion.

The  court  incorporated  by  reference  this  ruling  into  its  written  order  and  further 

explained the basis for its decision:

This  case  must  be  dismissed  in  its  entirety,  with  prejudice,  because 
Plaintiff Janet Graham (“Plaintiff”) willfully deleted text messages from her 
personal  electronic  devices  after  being  placed  on  notice  regarding  her 
preservation obligations, resulting in the permanent deletion, and therefore 
spoliation, of critical evidence that cannot be  recovered. Plaintiff’s actions 
and conduct, as detailed in this Order, the related motions and other filings 
addressing these issues, the transcripts from the hearings conducted on these 
issues, and the record as a whole, warrants this Court’s finding that dismissal 
is the only sanction consistent with the factors and considerations articulated 
by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  in  Tatham  v.  Bridgestone Americas 
Holding  Inc.,  473  S.W.3d  734,  747  (Tenn.  2015)  and  other  applicable 

- 4 -

Tennessee  law,  and  this  Court  hereby  finds  that  sanction  appropriate  and 
justified here for the following reasons:

.

.

.

.

3.

. . . In response to Defendant’s initial discovery requests, Plaintiff 
produced  text  messages  relevant  to  this  case  and  Defendant’s 
defenses. Following Plaintiff’s deposition in this case, which was 
conducted  on  February  13,  2019,  Defendant  served  her  with  a 
Third Set of Interrogatories on March 5, 2019, requesting, among 
other  information,  that  Plaintiff  identify  any  potentially  relevant 
text messages she may have deleted from the electronic devices in 
her  control.  On  April  8,  2019  Plaintiff  responded  and  indicated 
under  oath  in  her  Reponses  that  she  deleted  only  a  very  limited 
number of text messages, and she described the scope of what she 
maintained at that point in time she had deleted.

4. Defendant  also  requested  that  Plaintiff  provide  her  electronic 
devices  to  a  neutral  third  party  for  the  purposes  of  allowing  an 
inspecting of them to determine if text messages had been deleted 
and whether they could be recovered Plaintiff refused Defendant’s 
request,  and  Defendant  filed  its  Motion  to  Compel  Plaintiff  to 
Produce  Her  Cell  Phone  and  Other  Electronic  Devices  for 
Inspection and to Compel Plaintiff to Supplement Her Discovery 
Reponses on April 4, 2019.

5. After  an  indication  from  this  Court  during  oral  argument  that  it 
was  inclined  to  grant  Defendant’s  Motion  to  Compel  but  would 
give the parties a chance to reach an agreement, the parties jointly 
engaged  a  digital  forensic  expert,  Ted  Scott  of  Verity  Digital 
Forensics to conduct an inspection of Plaintiff’s Apple iPhone, her 
Apple laptop computer, and her iCloud account.

6. Ted  Scott’s  analysis  confirmed  Plaintiff  deleted  text  messages 
after commencing this lawsuit and after her deposition. Mr. Scott 
was  not  able  to  recover  the  content  of  many  of  the  deleted  text 
messages,  including  the  content  of  many  deleted  text  messages 
dated  after  the  date  of  Plaintiffs  deposition.  Despite  this  Court 
repeatedly  permitting  Plaintiff  further  efforts  to  recover  the 
content of deleted text messages dated after Plaintiff s deposition, 
it  was  confirmed  by  Mr.  Scott  during  the  March  6,  2020 
evidentiary  hearing  that  the  content  of  these  and  other  text 
messages  could  not,  in  fact,  be  recovered.  Also  by  that  date, 

- 5 -

Plaintiff, despite repeated chances to do so and her argument that 
the content could be recovered or reproduced, had not otherwise 
recovered these deleted text  messages or produced them or their 
content from another source like the recipient of the text(s).

7. Mr.  Scott’s  analysis  also  confirmed  Plaintiff  lied,  under  oath, 
about  the  spoliation  and  her  lack  of  preservation  efforts, 
specifically during her deposition and in her response to the Third 
Set of Interrogatories propounded by Defendant.

.

.

.

.

8. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s conduct compels dismissal of 
her  case  under  the  Tennessee  common  law  “unclean  hands” 
doctrine. . . .

9. Plaintiff intentionally violated her duty and obligation to preserve 
relevant evidence for this case. Plaintiff lied at least twice under 
oath  about  her  efforts  to  preserve  and  produce  relevant  text 
messages  during  discovery  in  this  case.  Further,  even  though 
Defendant  was  able  to  obtain  a  digital  forensic  analysis  of 
Plaintiff’s  cell  phone  and  other  electronic  devices,  which 
recovered  some  deleted  text  messages,  not  all  text  messages  or 
their content were recoverable. Thus, due to Plaintiff’s intentional 
deletion of text messages, Defendant does not have access to what 
is possibly critical evidence to its defenses in this case. Plaintiff’s 
destruction of this critical evidence and repeated dishonesty about 
it  demonstrates  her  unclean  hands  and  efforts  to  manipulate  this 
litigation  unfairly  in  her  favor.  The  Court  finds  that  Plaintiff’s 
unclean hands prevent her from pursuing her lawsuit any further.

10. Based  on  the  foregoing,  Plaintiff’s  spoliation  of  evidence  also 
compels dismissal of her case under the Tennessee Rules of Civil 
Procedure. . . .

.

.

.

.

13. As the Court found during the March 6 hearing, “under the Tatham
factors  the  appropriate  sanction  would  be  the  dismissal  with 
prejudice  of  Ms.  Graham’s  claims.”  Plaintiff  intentionally 
spoliated text message evidence, even after being reminded of her 
obligation to preserve potentially relevant evidence. Plaintiff then 
lied under oath on at least two occasions regarding the extent of 

- 6 -

her  spoliation  of  evidence  and  her  lack  of  preservation  efforts. 
While  the  content  of  some  of  the  deleted  text  messages  was 
recovered by Ted Scott, the content of many deleted text messages 
dated  after  Plaintiff’s  deposition  are  irretrievable  and  also  not 
recoverable  from  any  other  source.  Text  messages  are  relevant 
evidence in this case and have proven to be critical to Defendant’s 
defenses.  Without  this  evidence,  Defendant  is  unable  to  defend 
against Plaintiff s claims. Therefore, the only appropriate sanction 
is dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint with prejudice.

Plaintiff later filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the trial court 

denied.

Defendant then moved for an award of attorney’s fees and expenses “incurred as a 
result  of  Plaintiff’s  spoliation  of  evidence,  starting  from  February  2019  until  the  final 
judgment.” Plaintiff did not oppose the award, but she disputed the amount of fees to which 
Defendant was entitled.

In  its  final  order  on  December  4,  2020,  the  trial  court  awarded  $99,557.48  in 
attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses to Defendant under Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure 
34A.02,  37.01(4),  and  54.04.  Plaintiff  subsequently  moved  to  stay  execution  of  the 
judgment  pending  appeal,  which  the  trial  court  granted,  and  she  deposited  surety  of 
$107,762.79 with the Shelby County Circuit Court Clerk.

This appeal followed. 

Plaintiff raises four issues on appeal:

ISSUES

1. Whether the trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the equitable 
doctrine of unclean hands as a basis to dismiss this employment law case, 
when (1) it is not a case in equity, as Plaintiff made claims for legal, not 
equitable,  relief;  and  (2)  Plaintiff’s  alleged  spoliation  of  text  messages 
involved the discovery process, unrelated to the merits of the employment 
discrimination, harassment, and retaliation claims?

2. Whether  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  by  dismissing  Plaintiff’s 
employment law case as a spoliation sanction, in violation of Tatham v. 
Bridgestone  Americas  Holding,  Inc.,  473  S.W.3d  734  (Tenn.  2015), 
relying  instead  on  its  findings  of  Plaintiff’s  credibility,  intent,  and 
speculation of prejudice to impose the most severe sanction, when (1) the 
trial  court  failed  to  make  adequate  findings  about  any  prejudice 

- 7 -

Defendant  allegedly  suffered  from  spoliation  of  largely  recovered  text 
messages;  (2)  there  was  a  complete  lack  of  evidence  about  actual 
prejudice in the record, much less evidence sufficient to support a finding 
of  significant  prejudice;  (3)  the  record  demonstrates  that  any  prejudice 
was  sufficiently  remedied  by  the  forensic  analysis  and  Plaintiff’s 
subsequent investigation and explanation; (4) the trial court placed undue 
weight on Plaintiff’s “intent” to commit spoliation; and (5) it did not find, 
nor  could  the  evidence  support,  that  dismissal  was  the  least  severe 
sanction available to remedy any remaining prejudice? 

3. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Defendant full 
attorney’s fees related to the alleged spoliation as a sanction, in violation 
of Tatham v. Bridgestone Americas Holding, Inc., 473 S.W.3d 734 (Tenn. 
2015), relying instead on its findings of Plaintiff’s credibility, intent, and 
speculation of prejudice, when (1) the trial court failed to make adequate 
findings  about  any  prejudice  Defendant  allegedly  suffered  from 
spoliation of largely recovered text messages; (2) there was a complete 
lack of evidence about actual prejudice in the record, much less evidence 
sufficient  to  support  a  finding  of  significant  prejudice;  (3)  the  record 
demonstrates that any prejudice was sufficiently remedied by the forensic 
analysis and Plaintiff’s subsequent investigation and explanation; (4) the 
trial  court  placed  undue  weight  on  Plaintiff’s  “intent”  to  commit 
spoliation;  and  (5)  it  did  not  find,  nor  could  the  evidence  support,  that 
awarding nearly $90,000 of attorney’s fees was the least severe sanction 
available to remedy any remaining prejudice?

4. Whether this court should reverse the trial court’s award of discretionary 
costs should Plaintiff prevail on appeal, in whole or in part, as Defendant 
would no longer be the sole “prevailing party” under the rules?

As her first issue, Plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred by dismissing her case 
under the doctrine of unclean hands. Plaintiff reasons that the doctrine of unclean hands 
does not apply because her misconduct during discovery was unconnected to her claims.4

                                           

4 Plaintiff also argues (1) that the doctrine of unclean hands applies only to claims for equitable 
relief  and  (2)  that  trial  court’s  written  order—which  was  prepared  by  Defendant’s  counsel—does  not 

ANALYSIS

I. UNCLEAN HANDS

- 8 -

But  as  an  initial  matter,  the  parties  disagree  on  the  proper  standard  of  review.  Plaintiff 
asserts  that we should review the trial court’s decision de novo with no presumption of 
correctness, and Defendant asserts that we should review the decision to determine whether 
the court exceeded its discretion.

A.

Standard of Review

It is well-established that “the application of the doctrine of unclean hands is within 
the  [trial]  court’s  discretion,  and  we  review  the  court’s  decision  under  the  abuse  of 
discretion  standard.”  Fuller  v.  Cmty. Nat’l  Bank,  No.  E2018-02023-COA-R3-CV,  2020 
WL 1485696, at  *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2020) (quoting  Spirit Broadband, LLC v. 
Armes, No. M2015-00559-COA-R3-CV, 2017 WL 384248, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 
2017));  see  also  In  re  Est.  of  Boote,  265  S.W.3d  402,  418  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2007) 
(“Decisions regarding the proper application of the doctrine of unclean hands are heavily 
fact-dependent  and  are  addressed  to  the  considerable  discretion  of  the  trial  court.”); 
Coleman Mgmt., Inc. v. Meyer, 304 S.W.3d 340, 348 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2009) (“Whether the 
doctrine of ‘unclean hands’ should apply is an issue within the trial court’s discretion and 
will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.”).

The abuse of discretion standard encompasses three considerations:

(1)  whether  the  factual  basis  for  the  decision  is  properly  supported  by 
evidence in the record, (2) whether the [trial] court properly identified and 
applied the most appropriate legal principles applicable to the decision, and 
(3) whether the [trial] court’s  decision was within the range of  acceptable 
alternative dispositions.

Lee  Medical,  Inc.  v.  Beecher,  312  S.W.3d  515,  524  (Tenn.  2010).  The  first  two 
considerations  implicate  familiar  standards  of  review:  appellate  courts  “review  the 
underlying factual findings using the preponderance of the evidence standard contained in 
Tenn.  R.  App.  P.  13(d),”  and  we  review  the  trial  court’s  legal  determinations  “de  novo 
without any presumption of correctness.” Id. at 525.

The third Lee Medical consideration—whether the trial court’s decision was within 
the  range  of  acceptable  alternative  dispositions—involves  a  much  more  deferential 
standard.  This  is  because  “discretionary  decisions  involve  a  choice  among  acceptable 
alternatives.”  Harmon  v.  Hickman  Cmty.  Healthcare  Servs.,  Inc.,  594  S.W.3d  297,  306 
(Tenn. 2020) (quoting State v. McCaleb, 582 S.W.3d 179, 186 (Tenn. 2019)). Thus, while 
appellate courts must articulate “the boundaries of the permissible range of the trial court’s 
                                           

accurately reflect the decision of the trial court. See Smith v. UHS of Lakeside, Inc., 439 S.W.3d 303, 315 
(Tenn. 2014). We pretermit these issues because we have resolved the appeal on other grounds.

options,” they cannot “second-guess a trial court’s exercise of its discretion simply because 
the trial court chose an alternative that the appellate courts would not have chosen.”  Id.
(first quoting BIF, a Div. of Gen. Signals Controls, Inc. v. Serv. Const. Co., No. 87-136-II, 
1988 WL 72409, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 13, 1988), then quoting McCaleb, 582 S.W.3d 
at 186). Accordingly, a trial court’s discretionary choice must be affirmed if “reasonable 
minds can disagree with the propriety of the decision.” Id. (quoting McCaleb, 582 S.W.3d 
at 186).

Plaintiff does not dispute whether the factual basis for the trial court’s decision is 
properly  supported  by  evidence  in  the  record  or  whether  the  court’s  decision  would  be 
“within the range of acceptable alternative dispositions” if the doctrine applied. Instead, 
Plaintiff  argues  that  the  doctrine  of  unclean  hands  was  inapplicable as  a  matter  of  law
because her spoliation of evidence was unrelated to the merits of her claims. This argument 
implicates the second consideration in the Lee Medical framework: whether the trial court 
“applied the most appropriate legal principles.” 312 S.W.3d at 525. Therefore, our review 
will be de novo with no presumption of correctness. See id.; see also Ne. Women’s Ctr., 
Inc. v. McMonagle, 868 F.2d 1342, 1354 (3d Cir. 1989) (“Ordinarily, an abuse of discretion 
standard  applies  to  our  review  of  the  district  court’s  application  of  the  unclean  hands 
doctrine.  However,  the  parameters  of  the  unclean  hands  doctrine  implicate  a  matter  of 
law.”);  accord United Bank v.  Buckingham, 761 F.  App’x 185, 190–91 (4th Cir. 2019); 
PCA Mins., LLC v. Merit Energy Co., LLC, 725 F. App’x 342, 346 (6th Cir. 2018).

B.

Nexus Between Claims and Misconduct

Plaintiff contends that the doctrine of unclean hands was inapplicable because her 
spoliation of evidence “related to the discovery process and [was] not tied to the merits of 
the case itself.” We agree.

The  doctrine  of  unclean  hands  states  that  “he  who  comes  into  a  court  of  equity, 
asking its interposition in his behalf, must come with  clean hands.” In re Mattie L., 618 
S.W.3d 335, 344 (Tenn. 2021) (quoting C.F. Simmons Med. Co. v. Mansfield Drug Co., 23 
S.W. 165, 168 (Tenn. 1893)). The doctrine “provides the court with a basis to decline to 
grant relief to parties who have willfully engaged in unconscionable, inequitable, immoral, 
or illegal acts with regard to the subject matter of their claims.”  In re Est. of Boote, 265 
S.W.3d at 417 (footnote omitted)). Its purpose is to “repel” a party “whose requested ‘relief 
grows out of or depends upon or is inseparably connected with his own prior fraud.’” In re 
Mattie L., 618 S.W.3d at 344 (quoting Fuller, 2020 WL 1485696, at *5).

The  doctrine  of  unclean  hands  is  considered  an  “affirmative  defense.”  See 
Tennessee State Bank v. Mashek, 616 S.W.3d 777, 813 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2020). But it “is 
intended  to  protect  the  courts,”  not  the  parties. In  re  Est.  of  Boote,  265  S.W.3d  at  417 
(citations omitted). The doctrine allows a court to avoid interposing “its aid to secure the 
fruits  of  unfair  and  unscrupulous  dealings,”  becoming  “a  party  to  the  scheme,”  or 

- 10 -

encouraging  “the  practice  of  devious  ways  that  corrupt  the  place  of  its  habitat.”  Fuller, 
2020  WL  1485696,  at  *6  (quoting  S.  Coal  &  Coke  Co.  v.  Beech  Grove  Min.  Co.,  381 
S.W.2d 299, 303 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1963)).

However,  the  doctrine  “is  limited  to  ‘misconduct  connected  with  the  particular 
matter in litigation.’” In re Mattie L., 618 S.W.3d at 345 (quoting Chappell v. Dawson, 308 
S.W.2d  420,  421  (Tenn.  1957)).  In  other  words,  the doctrine  applies  only  to  a  party’s 
misconduct “in and about the same matters whereof he complains of his adversary, or if 
his claim to relief grows out of or depends upon or is inseparably connected with his 
own  prior  fraud.”  Fuller, 2020  WL  1485696,  at  *5 (emphasis  added)  (citation  omitted) 
(quoting  C.F.  Simmons  Med.  Co.,  23  S.W.  at  168).  This  is  because  a  party  guilty  of 
misconduct “in reference to a particular transaction” cannot enforce rights “growing out of 
such transaction.” Alexander v. JB Partners, 380 S.W.3d 772, 776 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2011) 
(quoting Riverside Surgery Ctr., LLC v. Methodist Health Sys., Inc., 182 S.W.3d 805, 813 
(Tenn. Ct. App. 2005)).

Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s misconduct was inseparably tied to her claims of 
discrimination, harassment, and retaliation because she incited Dr. Cooper to “lose his shit” 
in  May  2017  and  then  misrepresented  the  extent  of  her  contact  with  a  witness  during 
Defendant’s  internal  investigation.  The  trial  court,  however,  made  no  findings  on these 
allegations. Instead, the court found that Plaintiff’s hands were unclean because she tried 
to manipulate the litigation by permanently and intentionally deleting text messages and 
lying about it:

9. Plaintiff  intentionally  violated  her  duty  and  obligation  to  preserve 
relevant  evidence  for  this  case. Plaintiff  lied  at  least  twice  under  oath 
about her efforts to preserve and produce relevant text messages during 
discovery in this case. Further, even though Defendant was able to obtain 
a  digital  forensic  analysis  of Plaintiff’s  cell  phone  and  other  electronic 
devices,  which  recovered  some  deleted  text  messages,  not  all  text 
messages  or  their  content  were  recoverable.  Thus,  due  to  Plaintiff’s 
intentional deletion of text messages, Defendant does not have access to 
what is possibly critical evidence to its defenses in this case. Plaintiff’s
destruction  of  this  critical  evidence  and  repeated  dishonesty  about  it 
demonstrates her unclean hands and efforts to manipulate this litigation 
unfairly  in  her  favor.  The  Court  finds that  Plaintiff’s  unclean  hands 
prevent her from pursuing her lawsuit any further.

While  we  do  not  condone  Plaintiff’s  conduct,  we  respectfully  disagree  that  the 
doctrine of unclean hands applies in this case. In doing so, we find the Tennessee Supreme 
Court’s decision in In re Mattie L., 618 S.W.3d 335 to be particularly persuasive. In that 
case, the  defendant-father  made  misrepresentations  during  discovery  about  his  military 

- 11 -

service and his treatment for alcohol addiction. Id. at 344. The Court held that the doctrine 
of  unclean  hands  did  not  apply because  the  father  was  defending  against  a  petition  to 
terminate his parental rights on the ground of abandonment. Id. at 345. The Court reasoned 
that  the  father’s  misrepresentations  related  “to  the  litigation  as  a  whole”  and  were  “not 
material to whether [the f]ather had abandoned his child.” Id.

Similarly, we find Plaintiff’s deletion of text messages and misrepresentations about 
her preservation efforts “relate to the litigation as a whole” and are not material to whether 
Defendant  discriminated,  harassed,  and  retaliated  against  Plaintiff.  In  other  words,
Plaintiff’s claims did not “grow out of” or  “depend upon” her deletion of text messages 
and lack of candor during discovery. For these reasons, we disagree with the trial court’s 
decision to dismiss Plaintiff’s action under the doctrine of unclean hands.

II. SANCTION FOR SPOLIATION

Next, Plaintiff contends that the trial court exceeded its discretion by dismissing the 
case and awarding Defendant its attorney’s fees as a remedy for her spoliation of evidence 
under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 34A.02.

Rule 34A.02 provides, “Rule 37 sanctions may be imposed upon a party or an agent 
of  a  party  who  discards,  destroys,  mutilates,  alters,  or  conceals  evidence.” Rule  37 
sanctions include but are not limited to orders dismissing the action or rendering a default 
judgment. Tenn. R. Civ. P. 37.02(C).

It is uncontested that Plaintiff deleted text  messages and that those text  messages 
were “evidence” for the purpose of Rule 34A.02.5 The issue is whether the trial court erred 
in  its  choice  of  sanction. In  Tatham  v.  Bridgestone  Americas  Holding,  473  S.W.3d  734 
(Tenn.  2015),  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  held  that “the  analysis  for  the  possible 
imposition  of  any  sanction  for  the  spoliation  of  evidence  should  be  based  upon  a 
consideration  of  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.” Id.  at  746.  The  Court  then  identified 
four relevant, non-exclusive factors:

Factors  which  are  relevant  to  a  trial  court’s  consideration  of  what,  if  any, 
sanction should be imposed for the spoliation of evidence include:

                                           

5 In her reply brief, Plaintiff argues for the first time that the trial court made insufficient findings 
of relevance. However, in a May 2019 agreement for the inspection of her cellphone, Plaintiff stipulated 
that text messages were “relevant and discoverable in the lawsuit.” During the hearing in January 2020, 
counsel for Plaintiff conceded that Plaintiff deleted relevant text messages.

- 12 -

(1) the culpability of the spoliating party in causing the destruction of the 
evidence,  including  evidence  of  intentional  misconduct  or  fraudulent 
intent;

(2) the degree of prejudice suffered by the non-spoliating party as a result 
of the absence of the evidence;

(3) whether, at the time the evidence was destroyed, the spoliating party 
knew or should have known that the evidence was relevant to pending or 
reasonably foreseeable litigation; and

(4) the least severe sanction available to remedy any prejudice caused to 
the non-spoliating party.

Id. at 746.6

As  Plaintiff  correctly  observes,  the  first  and  third Tatham factors  pertain to  the 
spoliating  party’s  intent  and  knowledge,  and  the  second  and  fourth  factors  focus  on  the 
non-spoliating party’s injury. See id. at 746 (discussing “the trial court’s inherent authority 
to sanction abuses of the discovery process and to remedy the potential prejudice caused 
thereby”); Jamie S. Gorelick et. al, Destruction of Evidence § 3.16 (2022) (“To fulfill the 
purposes  of  discovery  sanctions .
. —that  is,  to  restore  the  accuracy  of  the  trial, 
compensate innocent victims, and punish guilty spoliators—courts select the least onerous 
sanction corresponding to the willfulness of the destructive act and the prejudice suffered 
by the victim.”).

.

As  for  intent,  the  trial  court  found  that  Plaintiff  “willfully”  and  “intentionally” 
deleted  the  text  messages  “after  being  placed  on  notice  regarding  her  preservation 
obligations” and then “lied under oath on at least two occasions regarding the extent of her 
spoliation [of] evidence and her lack of preservation efforts.” For prejudice, the trial court 
acknowledged that it had  “no [way] of  knowing” what the  missing messages contained, 
but  the  court  noted  that  text  messages  were  “relevant  evidence”  and  had  “proven  to  be 
critical  to  Defendant’s  defenses.” And  while  the  court  did  not  articulate  the  specific 

                                           

6 More  generally,  “In  determining  the  appropriate  sanction  when  a  party abuses  or  violates  the 
discovery process, a trial court should consider the following four factors: (1) the party’s explanation for 
not providing evidence during discovery; (2) the importance of the evidence; (3) the other party’s need for 
time to prepare to meet the evidence; and (4) the possibility and propriety of granting a continuance.” Adams 
v. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co., No. W2020-01290-COA-R3-CV, 2022 WL 170134, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 
19, 2022) (citing Mercer v. Vanderbilt Univ., Inc., 134 S.W.3d 121, 133 (Tenn. 2004); Est. of Brock ex rel. 
Yadon v. Rist, 63 S.W.3d 729, 732 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)).

prejudice  suffered  by  Defendant,  it  found  that  it  would  be  “unduly  prejudicial”  to  force 
Defendant to defend against Plaintiff’s claims.

We  will  set  aside  a  trial  court’s  choice  of  sanction  only  when  the  court  “has 
misconstrued or misapplied the controlling legal principles or has acted inconsistently with 
the  substantial  weight  of  evidence.” Tatham,  473  S.W.3d  at  747  (quoting  Mercer, 134 
S.W.3d at 133). Plaintiff has not appealed the trial court’s findings related to her intent, but 
she contends that the trial court misapplied the controlling legal principles by not making 
“sufficient  findings” of  prejudice. In  the  alternative, Plaintiff  argues  that  the  trial  court 
acted inconsistently with the substantial weight of evidence. We respectfully disagree.

Prejudice is only one of four non-exclusive factors that the Supreme Court identified 
in Tatham as relevant to a trial court’s consideration of what, if any, sanctions to impose. 
See id. at 747. Contrary to Plaintiff’s position on appeal, the Supreme Court did not hold 
that  prejudice  was  a  prerequisite  to  the  imposition  of  sanctions,  even  the  sanction  of 
dismissal. Rather, the Court stated, “To adopt an inflexible, bright-line rule restricting a 
trial court’s power to fashion the appropriate remedy for spoliation of evidence would be 
contrary to the trial court’s inherent authority to sanction abuses of the discovery process 
and to remedy the potential prejudice caused thereby.” Id. at 746.

Moreover, “the intentional spoliation or destruction of evidence relevant to a case 
raises a [rebuttable] presumption . . . that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the 
cause of the spoliator.” Id. at 741 (quoting Thurman-Bryant Elec. Supply Co., Inc. v. Unisys 
Corp., Inc., No. 03A01-CV00152, 1991 WL 222256, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 1991). 
Importantly, “A presumption is a substitute for evidence.” Raines v. Pile, 185 S.W.2d 628, 
631  (Tenn.  1945)  (quoting  Siler  v.  Siler,  277  S.W.  886,  887  (Tenn.  1925)).  Thus,  the 
presumption that intentionally spoliated material would have been unfavorable to the cause 
of the spoliator stands in for evidence of prejudice and shifts the burden of proof. See Stone 
v.  City  of  McMinnville,  896  S.W.2d  548,  550  (Tenn.  1995) (discussing  burden-shifting 
effect of presumptions); Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 174 F.3d 801, 
804 (6th Cir. 1999) (“If a threshold showing of spoliation is made, the burden then shifts 
to  the  proponent  of  the  evidence  to  prove  that  the  other  side  was  not  prejudiced  by  the 
alteration or destruction of the evidence.”).

Accordingly, once Defendant made a threshold showing of intentional spoliation, a 
presumption arose that Defendant was prejudiced by the loss of evidence. See Tatham, 473 
S.W.3d  at  741.  Plaintiff  attempted  to  rebut  this  presumption  by  recovering  the  missing 
messages,  which  she  was  unable  to  do.  And  while  Plaintiff  contends that  the  missing 
messages  were  related  to  a  genealogical project,  she  never  presented  any  evidence,  via 
deposition or affidavit, to support this contention. The contention was merely theorized by 
Plaintiff’s attorneys, who surmised that the attachments were related to a family history 
project,  which  is  significant  because  “argument  of  counsel  is  not  evidence.”  Martin  v. 

- 14 -

Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 271 S.W.3d 76, 86 fn. 3 (Tenn. 2008); see Groves v. Ernst-W. Corp., 
No. M2017-01779-COA-R3-CV, 2018 WL 3600015, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 26, 2018) 
(holding that statements made by counsel during the course of a hearing, trial, or argument 
are not evidence (citing Trotter v. State, 508 S.W.2d 808, 809 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974))). 
And for reasons that are unknown, Plaintiff waited until after the trial court ruled against 
her to obtain a second opinion on whether the missing messages could be recovered from 
her laptop.7

Plaintiff acknowledges on appeal that the trial court’s primary reason for imposing 
sanctions was its findings related to Plaintiff intentional misconduct—which Plaintiff does 
not contest on appeal. Based on the above, we cannot say that the trial court incorrectly 
applied the law or that the evidence preponderates against the court’s decision. See id.8

CONCLUSION

We affirm the trial court’s judgment. Costs of appeal are assessed against appellant, 
Janet  Graham,  and  this  matter  is  remanded  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this 
opinion.

7 Even after obtaining a second opinion saying that the missing messages were still preserved on 
her devices, Plaintiff stopped short of actually producing the messages or otherwise proving their contents. 
For this and other reasons, the trial court found Plaintiff’s late-submitted evidence was not credible.

8 Because we have affirmed the trial court’s decision, we pretermit the issue of whether this court 

should reverse the trial court’s award of discretionary costs.
