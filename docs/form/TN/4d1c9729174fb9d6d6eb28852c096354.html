See Rule 15.05 (1). Attorneys who have taken and passed the bar examination in another United States jurisdiction, 
who are active members of the bar in a qualifying jurisdiction, and who have lawfully engaged in the active, substantial 
and continuous practice of law for no less than five of the seven years immediately preceding their application for 
admission under this rule may be admitted to the practice of law in Oregon without having to take and pass the Oregon 
bar examination, subject to the requirements of this rule.

See FAQ document. The continuous practice of law means at least 1,000 hours of work per year (RFA 1.05(8)). This 
work does not need to be five consecutive years, but rather five years within a seven year timeframe. The 1,000 hours, 
also, does not need to be performed over a calendar year or twelve month period.

Rule 204(4) requires an applicant to prove that he/she has “for a period of five years of the last seven years 
immediately preceding the date of filing of the application … devoted a major portion of time and energy to the practice 
of law in one or more states.” The Board will not count any work towards the practice requirement that is before the 
date of the applicant’s admission to the bar. The Board interprets the phrase "devoted a major portion of time and 
energy to the practice of law" to mean that the applicant spent more than 50 percent of his/her time engaged in the 
practice of law. An applicant must demonstrate at least five years’ worth of work in which he/she devoted more than 20 
hours of work per week to the practice of law.

provides documentary evidence showing that for three (3) of the last five (5) years immediately preceding the 
application for admission without examination, the applicant, as principal occupation, has been actively, continuously, 
and lawfully engaged in the practice of law, in a state or states that allow South Dakota attorneys substantially similar 
admission without examination, as:
1) a sole practitioner;
2) a member of a law firm, professional corporation or association;
3) a judge in a court of record;
4) an attorney for any local or state governmental entity;
5) inside counsel for a corporation, agency, association or trust
department; and/or,
6) an attorney with the federal government or a federal governmental agency including service as a member of the 
Judge Advocate General Department of one of the military branches of the United States.

  (1) For the purposes of this Rule, in addition to the definitions of “Practice of Law” and “Law Business” in section 1.01 
of this Rule, the “active practice of law” shall include the following activities, if performed in a jurisdiction in which the 
applicant is admitted, or if performed in a jurisdiction that permits such activity by a lawyer not admitted to practice:
             (A) full-time private or public practice as a licensed attorney;
             (B) teaching law full-time at a law school approved by the ABA;
             (C) service as a judicial law clerk or staff attorney; and
             (D) service as a Judge, Attorney General, Public Defender, U.S. Attorney, District Attorney, or duly registered 
In-House Counsel or Military Spouse.

Determining What Counts as the Active, Substantial, and Lawful Practice of Law
Rule 1(a)(11) describes the practice of law to include:
private practice as a sole practitioner or for a law firm, legal services office, legal clinic, public agency, or similar entity;
practice as an attorney for an individual or for a corporation, partnership, trust, or other entity with the primary duties of 
furnishing legal counsel and advice; drafting and interpreting legal documents and pleadings; interpreting and giving 
advice regarding the law; or preparing, trying, or presenting cases before courts, departments of government, or 
administrative agencies;
practice as an attorney for a local government or the state or federal government, with the same primary duties 
described in the preceding subsection;
employment as a judge, magistrate, referee, or similar official for a local government or the state or federal 
government, provided that the employment is open only to licensed attorneys;
employment as a full-time teacher of law at an approved law school;
any combination of the preceding categories.

See Rule 14-705. Admission by motion.
has been Actively licensed and lawfully engaged in the Full-time Practice of Law as defined in Rule 14-701 in the 
reciprocal jurisdiction(s) where licensed for 60 of the 84 months immediately preceding the date the application for 
admission is filed. For  purposes of admission under this rule and  with the exception of lawyers licensed in Utah as 
House Counsel, any time practicing at an office located in Utah will not be counted as time practicing in a reciprocal 
jurisdiction; 
See Rule 14-701. Definitions.
“Full-time Practice” means the Active and lawful Practice of Law for no fewer than 80 hours per month. Time spent on 
administrative or managerial duties, continuing legal education, or client development and marketing does not qualify 
as part of the required 80 hours of legal work.

to filing the registration may be counted for purposes of sub. (1)(b).

Columbia where the applicant was admitted to practice law, may be deemed to be the
practice of law for the purposes of sub. (1)(b):
