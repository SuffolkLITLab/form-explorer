      <pre>MEMORIAL RESOLUTION 
JUSTICE CORNELIA A. “CONNIE” CLARK 

September 10, 1950 – September 24, 2021 

 

June 2022 

ustice  Cornelia  A.  “Connie”  Clark  was  born  on  September  10,  1950,  in 
Franklin,  Tennessee.    She  lived  her  entire  adult  life  in  the  city,  where  ten 
generations of her family also have resided.  She passed away peacefully at 
her Franklin home on September 24, 2021, at the age of 71.  Fittingly, she 
was  surrounded  by  her  beloved  and  devoted  family,  including  her  sister, 
Cathy,  her  sister-in-law,  Lulu,  her  nephews,  and  her  great-nieces  and 
nephews, all of whom she absolutely adored.   

Justice Clark faithfully served the Tennessee judiciary and her community for 
more than four decades in so many ways.  She began her service as a teacher, 
a role she enjoyed and brought to her work in the judiciary.  She earned her 
undergraduate degree at Vanderbilt in 1971 and then earned a master of arts 
in teaching at Harvard University in 1972. She taught high school history and 
government before entering Vanderbilt Law School, where she was a member 
of  the  editorial  board  for  the  Vanderbilt  Law  Review  and  the  only  student 
member of the 1979-80 dean search committee. 

After law school, Justice Clark practiced law in Nashville and Franklin.  In 1984, 
she became one of the first female partners in a large Nashville law firm.  She 
specialized in municipal and employment law, and represented many cities, 
police departments, and several school boards. 

She  also  joined  legal  organizations  that  advocated  for  the  advancement  of 
women  in  leadership  roles,  including  the  Lawyers’  Association  for  Women, 
Marion  Griffin  Chapter,  and  the  Tennessee  Lawyers’  Association  for 
Women.  She chaired the Board of Directors of the Nashville YWCA and served 
on 
the  League  of  Women  Voters  of  Williamson 
County.   Throughout  the  1980s,  Justice  Clark  supported  and  advocated  for 
more women to be appointed and elected to the bench.   

the  Board  of

Her turn to join the judiciary came in 1989, when Governor Ned McWherter 
appointed Justice Clark to the trial bench covering the 21st Judicial District of 
Williamson, Hickman, Perry, and Lewis Counties. In this role she became the 
first female trial judge to serve rural counties in Tennessee.  She served the 
21st judicial district for ten years, paving the way for future female judges to 
be accepted by clerks, litigants, lawyers, and other judges. 

Justice Clark’s excellent service as a trial judge did not go unnoticed.  In 1999, 
the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  asked  her  to  serve  as  Director  of  the 
Administrative Office of the Courts.  Not surprisingly, Justice Clark excelled in 
this role as well.  She spearheaded the Court’s efforts to modernize judicial 
policies,  processes,  and  programs,  while  also  instilling  professionalism  and 
excellence in the office and staff of the AOC. She created methods and models 
that are still utilized today at the AOC. 

In 2005, Justice Clark was named to the Tennessee Supreme Court, becoming 
only the fourth woman in state history to serve as a justice.  In 2008, Justice 
Clark was delighted to be a part of the Court with the first female majority in 
state history.  The Court has remained majority female since 2008, and Justice 
Clark would be thrilled that her passing did not change that fact. 

In 2010, Justice Clark became the second female to serve a two-year term as 
Chief  Justice.    In  2014,  she  ran  for  re-election  and  won  another  eight-year 
term, despite an organized and well-funded campaign to defeat her.  Justice 
Clark  served  the  Court  until  her  death  last  year.    She  attained  16  years  of 
service,  the  second  longest  tenure  of  any  woman  to  serve  on  the  Supreme 
Court to date.  She participated in more than 1,100 cases during her tenure.   

Even  more  importantly,  Justice  Clark  was  an  exemplary  role  model  for  all 
judges.  She was well-known for her precise and detailed legal analysis and 
writing style, as well as being an active and thoughtful questioner during oral 
arguments. Justice Clark’s judicial temperament was aptly described as “pitch-
perfect.”  She was calm and measured during tense and sometimes divided 
Court discussions.  She looked for solutions to disagreements among the Court 
that  would  aid  the  Court  in  achieving  unanimous  or  majority  decisions  on 
difficult  issues.    She  was  brilliant  and  also  incredibly  fair.    She  was  fully 
committed to deciding cases on the facts and the law, without regard to her 
own  personal  preferences  and  to  political  considerations.    Her  institutional 
knowledge and expertise were unsurpassed and irreplaceable.  Her reverence 
and respect for the Court as an institution were remarkable. 

Her  passion  for  the  principle  of  equal  justice  under  law  was  illustrated  in 
Justice Clark’s work as the Supreme Court’s liaison to the Access to Justice

Commission  from  2014  until  her  death.    Justice  Clark  wholeheartedly 
embraced this initiative.  She travelled the State and also around the country 
speaking  to  attorneys,  judges,  and  other  interested  groups  about  the 
importance  of  judicial  support  for  such  activities.   She  pioneered  the 
successful Faith and Justice Alliance, which brings attorneys into community 
faith-based  and  other  civic  organizations,  where  clients  may  feel  more 
comfortable about sharing their problems than in a traditional courthouse or 
law  firm  setting.  Today,  hundreds  of  Tennessee  houses  of  worship  provide 
thousands  of  hours  of  pro  bono  legal  service  to  more  than  7,000  people  a 
year.    Justice  Clark’s  leadership  and  unwavering  support  as  liaison  made  it 
possible  for  Tennessee  to  be  recognized  as  a  national  leader  in  access  to 
justice initiatives. 

Justice  Clark’s  scope  of  work,  however,  extended  far  beyond  the  Supreme 
Court.   She  was  involved  in  nearly  every  program  and  project  in  the  court 
system, and she was a fixture in bar, community, and religious organizations 
in Middle Tennessee and nationally for more than 40 years. 

Justice  Clark  chaired  the  Tennessee  Judicial  Council  and  was  the  inaugural 
chair  of  the  Judicial  Evaluation  Commission.   She  previously  served  as  a 
member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Conference  of  State  Court 
Administrators.  In 2004, she was named one of the 21 members of the ABA 
Commission on the American Jury, which is dedicated to educating the public 
about, and reinvigorating the nation's commitment to, jury service.  

She never lost her love for teaching and frequently served as an instructor at 
the National Judicial College, American Academy of Judicial Education, and the 
American Institute for Justice, in addition to being a frequent guest speaker 
at various bar and other organizations.  Justice Clark served for ten years as 
an adjunct professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Law and served on 
the  faculty  of  the  Nashville  School  of  Law.   As  a  trial  judge,  Justice  Clark 
served as Vice President of the Tennessee Judicial Conference and Dean of the 
Tennessee  Judicial  Academy,  and  was  a  member  of  the  Supreme  Court 
Commissions on the Rules of Civil Procedure and Technology.  

She spoke frequently to civic and leadership groups about the importance of 
the rule of law and of an independent, accountable judiciary in protecting the 
constitutional rights accorded all persons and groups.  

Justice Clark also received numerous professional honors during her career, 
including  the  Janice  M.  Holder  Access  to  Justice  Award  from  the  Tennessee 
Alliance for Legal Services; the Tennessee Bar Association’s Justice Frank F. 
Drowota  III  Outstanding  Judicial  Service  Award;  the  Vanderbilt  University

School of Law Distinguished Service Award;  the Grayfred Gray Award from 
the Tennessee Association of Professional Mediators; the Judge Martha Craig 
Daughtrey Award from the Lawyers’ Association for Women - Marion Griffin 
Chapter;  the  Liberty  Bell  Award  given  by  the  Williamson  County  Bar 
Association; and the Pioneer Award from Vision 2020. Clark was also named 
Appellate  Judge  of  the  Year  by  the  Southeastern  Chapter  of  the  American 
Board of Trial Advocates and was inducted into the Nashville YWCA Academy 
for Women of Achievement, having served as a past president of the YWCA of 
Nashville and Middle Tennessee.  

She has also served on the boards of Goodwill Industries of Middle Tennessee 
and  the  Heritage  Foundation  of  Franklin  and  Williamson  County,  which 
recognized  her  with  its  Patrons  Award.  She  was  a  Fellow  of  the  Nashville, 
Tennessee and American Bar Foundations, and was the first woman to serve 
as chair of the Tennessee Bar Foundation.  She was also active in the Nashville 
and  Williamson  County  communities,  serving  as  board  chair  of  the  United 
Methodist Publishing House; a trustee of Martin Methodist College; and as a 
lay  leader  at  First  United  Methodist  in  Franklin.    To  honor  her  many 
contributions to the Franklin community, the City of Franklin Board of Mayor 
and Alderman recently honored Justice Clark by honorarily renaming Fourth 
Avenue  in  Franklin  in  her  honor.    Justice  Clark  lived  on  Fourth  Avenue 
practically her entire adult life.  

Justice  Clark  was  a  member  of  the  Williamson  County  Bar  Association, 
Tennessee  Bar  Association,  American  Bar  Association,  Tennessee  Lawyers’ 
Association for Women (founding member), Lawyers’ Association for Women, 
Marion  Griffin  Chapter  (former  board  member),  Nashville  Bar  Association 
(former  board  member  and  Second  Vice  President),  National  Association  of 
Women  Judges,  and  the  Nashville,  Tennessee,  and  American  Bar 
Foundations.  She was the first woman to serve as chair of the Tennessee Bar 
Foundation.  She also was a member of the Tennessee John Marshall American 
Inn  of  Court  and  the  Harry  Phillips  American  Inn  of  Court.  In  total,  Justice 
Clark  served  on  more  than  25  boards  and  worked  with  nearly  75 
organizations, commissions, advisory groups, or task forces since beginning 
her legal career in 1979. 

Justice  Clark  devoted  herself  to  public  service,  and  she  made  every 
organization and institution she served better in immeasurable ways. 1st Peter 
4:10 states: “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve 
others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.”  Our friend, 
Justice Connie Clark, fulfilled this Biblical command better than anyone I have 
ever known.  She profoundly displayed God’s lavish grace through her untiring

service  to  her  family,  community,  legal  profession,  judiciary,  and  State.  
Today, we mourn the passing of Justice Clark but celebrate her life of devoted 
and tireless service as a faithful steward of God’s grace. 

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Tennessee Judicial Conference 
 
that the foregoing Memorial Resolution in honor of Justice Cornelia A. “Connie” 
Clark, be entered on the minutes of this conference, that a copy be furnished 
to the West Publishing Company for inclusion in Tennessee Decisions and BE 
IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies thereof be furnished to members of her 
family. 

Respectfully submitted this 15th day of June, 2022.
