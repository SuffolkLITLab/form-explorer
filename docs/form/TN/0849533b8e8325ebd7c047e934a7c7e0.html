Introduction

The 2018 Tennessee Pro Bono Report is a publication of  the Tennessee Supreme Court 

Access to Justice Commission (the “ATJ Commission”). This latest edition of  this report 
compiles and analyzes data collected by the ATJ Commission and others. For the first time, 
the 2018 Report features additional Board of  Professional Responsibility (BPR) Data broken down 
by geographic location including county and state as well as by gender.

The ATJ Commission provides collaborative leadership to create solutions and resources that 
address and eliminate barriers to justice for all. The ATJ Commission is responsible for developing 
strategic planning focused on educating the public about legal needs, identifying priorities for 
improving access to justice, and recommending projects and programs to improve access to justice 
across the state. One focus of  the ATJ Commission is pro bono work that aids disadvantaged 
Tennesseans. The annual pro bono report educates about existing pro bono work happening in 
Tennessee to inspire future initiatives.

The 2018 Tennessee Pro Bono Report covers pro bono initiatives and data including but not limited 
to the following:

•

•

Information and statistics on pro bono work that was completed by individual attorneys in 2017
and reported in 2018, as voluntarily submitted on the BPR’s Annual Registration Statement,
which is required of  active attorneys on or before the first day of  the attorney’s birth month.

Information and statistics on pro bono activities of  legal aid providers, bar associations, law
schools, mediation centers, and other organizations regarding work performed in 2018.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionExecutive Summary

Tennessee made a good choice when it adopted its 

motto as “the Volunteer State.” The benefits of  
community volunteerism are well-documented 
and lead to better morale, deep satisfaction, and vibrant 
neighborhoods and societies. This year’s Pro Bono Report 
demonstrates how attorneys in the Volunteer State have 
created a culture invested in pro bono work that is gaining 
momentum in the fight to meet the civil legal needs of a ll 
Tennesseans.

Creating a culture of  pro bono is really quite simple and can 
ignite with a single spark. You volunteer at a clinic and inspire 
a colleague. A law firm learns of  a program at another firm 
and thinks “we can do that.” A house of  worship sees a flyer 
for a group serving the legal needs of  an at-risk population 
and the seed is set for a new project.

Pro Bono inspires pro bono, and momentum is building. 

More attorneys, and higher percentages of  attorneys, are 
reporting pro bono than ever before. For the second year 
in a row, more than half  of  Tennessee Attorneys reported 
pro bono hours. For the first time, more than half o f A ll 
Attorneys, which includes those living outside of  the state, 
reported performing pro bono hours. More attorneys were 
recognized as Attorneys for Justice. 

A culture of  pro bono is growing.

749,217 hours of  pro bono service were reported by 
All Attorneys, which is an increase of  more than 50,000 
hours from the prior year. What we are most proud of 
is the work done during these 749,217 hours focused on 
providing hands-on legal services to some of  our state’s most 
vulnerable populations. Ethnic minorities, single parents, 
the elderly, students, and veterans were the most common 
groups served. They were most likely to receive services at 
a legal clinic where attorneys were most likely to meet with 
them, provide advice, or review or draft a document. The 
issues they most often tackled were the ones that derail lives 
every day: family law, domestic violence, consumer law, and 
juvenile/education.

We are also impressed with how law firms, non-profits, 
and other partners described creative ways they used 
innovation, passion, and their own niche skills to impact their 
communities. For example, intellectual property law attorneys 
told us about how they leveraged their expertise to create 
and volunteer at pro bono events designed specifically for 
budding musicians and artists and help non-profits prepare 
and file trademark applications.

Stories submitted by partners give life to the numbers 
featured throughout the report. 

Whether attorneys want to use pro bono opportunities as a 
refreshing change to everyday practice or stay within their 
practice areas, there is a pro bono opportunity for everyone.

For the first time this year, we were able to separate out pro 
bono hours by county. We analyzed the data using three 
different metrics and regardless of  what measures we used, 
the same pattern kept appearing: pro bono work inspires pro 
bono work. Counties with the largest number of  attorneys 
reporting pro bono hours, top percentage of  attorneys 
providing pro bono, and the most attorneys providing pro 
bono per capita are clustered together. The data shows that
if  attorneys in Hardin County are serving the community, so 
are attorneys in neighboring McNairy and Wayne counties. 
If  Rutherford County attorneys are giving their time, so 
are attorneys in Wilson County. If  there is a culture of  pro 
bono in Washington County, it is also evident in Sullivan and 
Greene County. In total, 44 counties were in the Top 20 in 
one of  our three categories and all but one border another 
county that was recognized.

What you do inspires your colleagues and neighbors.

Attorneys can change lives through one interaction. One 
meeting, one phone call, one letter. Just a few minutes can 
make a difference . And just a few minutes donated here 
and there add up. In this report, we estimate the value of  
pro bono work done in the year at $137,805,970. That is a 
hefty figure and sizable donation, but the value is so much 
more than just a dollar sign. For the child who receives an 
individual education plan, to the family who still has a home 
after eviction threats, to the young adult whose record is 
expunged, your work is invaluable. The impact that your work 
has on the communities and persons served is immeasurable. 

The impact lawyers can have is not measured in dollars; 
it is measured in lives changed.

To the Tennessee Access to Justice Community, we could 
not be more proud of  the work you have done on behalf  
of  ensuring access to justice for all. As we continue to 
build momentum and a culture of  volunteerism in the legal 
community, we are excited for the future and what we can 
accomplish.

The Knoxville Barristers continued to sponsor 
monthly veterans legal advice clinics 
and quarterly Faith & Justice and Debt 
Relief  Legal Clinics. Lawyers and law 
students who participate in these clinics may 
not typically take a pro bono case through 
Legal Aid of  East Tennessee or through one 
of  the local law schools, so this project has 
been successful at increasing the number of  
lawyers performing pro bono legal services 
through legal advice clinics.

We were able to reach a great many people and restore faith in the justice system to each and every one. We 
were able to work with the first transgendered youth in full guardianship of  the state undergoing a change

A focus of  our work in 2018 was the April raid in Bean Station, Tennessee. Our community 
education, legal services, and community partnerships were all activated in service of  this rural 
immigrant community. For the first two weeks, we hosted legal clinics every day for 
families, where we provided immigration screenings, assisted in locating relatives, created 
powers of  attorney for their minors, and identified other legal issues such as custody 
and previous criminal charges. Through this and existing communications channels, we anticipate 
receiving 300 requests for support with removal defense. We will then route people to our 
network of  partners including the Southern Poverty Law Center, Latino Memphis, Community 
Legal Center, the private bar, or our staff  attorney, depending on the case.

In 2018, we increased our pro bono 
cases (accepted by pro bono attorneys) 
by 183% (from 68 cases in 2017 to 193 
cases in 2018). We also increased the 
number of  private attorneys accepting 
pro bono cases by almost 60% in 2018 
and the number of  private attorneys 
volunteering at clinics by 80%... In 
short, we have worked hard to “spread 
the love” and go where the need 
is great in order to assist more West 
Tennesseans in receiving legal aid.

The concept of  TN Free Legal Answers is a web-based 
pro bono clinic for low-income Tennesseans who 
might otherwise fall through the cracks of  receiving 
legal assistance. Using a web-based platform, qualifying 
users can post questions about their civil legal needs 
and receive basic legal information and advice from 
attorneys. The website is easy-to-use and is convenient 
for both volunteer attorneys and low-income 
Tennesseans. The goal of  this project is twofold: to 
increase access to justice for low-income 
Tennesseans, particularly in rural areas 
and to remove barriers to attorneys providing pro 
bono services. [In 2018], we worked with law students, 
corporate counsel, and law firms to help disadvantaged 
Tennesseans get answers to their legal questions.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionAttorney Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting – 
Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility

In Tennessee, Supreme Court Rule 8, 

Section 6.1 defines pro bono service and 
provides the aspirational goal that attorneys 

should provide 50 hours each of  pro bono 
service per year. Supreme Court Rule 9, Section 10 
requests (but does not require) that every attorney who is 
required to file an Annual Registration Statement with the 
Board of  Professional Responsibility (“BPR”) also voluntarily 
file a statement reporting the attorney’s pro bono service and 
activity during the last calendar year. The BPR provides this 
voluntary pro bono reporting data to the ATJ Commission 
for the purposes of  this report.

The Voluntary Pro Bono Reporting Form surveys pro 
bono service in the following four categories:
•  Legal services without a fee or at a substantially 

reduced fee to persons of  limited means;
•  Legal services without a fee to non-profit 

organizations serving persons of  limited means;
•  Legal services to groups and organizations at a 

reduced fee when payment of  standard fees would 
create a financial hardship; and

•  Legal services to improve the law, the legal system, 

or the legal profession.

This report separates data regarding the self-reported pro 
bono work of  attorneys into two major categories: attorneys 
whose primary address is located in Tennessee, and attorneys 

whose primary address is located outside of  Tennessee. 
The rationale for analyzing the two sets of  data separately is 
that attorneys whose primary address is located outside of  
Tennessee are more likely to have also completed their pro 
bono hours outside of  Tennessee. 

Definitions  are provided below.
• 

“All Attorneys” – all attorneys licensed to practice law 
in Tennessee regardless of  the location of  their primary 
address.
“Tennessee Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to practice 
law in Tennessee whose primary address is located in 
Tennessee.1  
 “Out-of-State Attorneys” - all attorneys licensed to 
practice law in Tennessee whose primary address is 
outside of  Tennessee.2  

• 

• 

The BPR collects data over the course of  a given year during 
its annual registration period, and this data includes voluntary 
reporting on pro bono completed during the prior year.3   
Attorneys report the pro bono work they performed in 2017 
in 2018. Therefore, the 2018 Pro Bono Report considers pro 
bono work performed by attorneys in 2017 but reported in 
2018.4  For the purposes of  this report, the data is labeled to 
correspond with the year the pro bono work was reported 
(“Reporting Year”), not the year the pro bono work was 
performed.

1  For  the purposes of  this report, whether an attorney has primary address located in Tennessee is determined by the address that the attorney provides 
to the BPR  in that attorney’s annual reporting statement. An attorney is determined to be a Tennessee attorney if  they reported residing in a state with the 
following abbreviations: TN, Tenn., Tennessee, or Tn. 

2  Some reports for attorneys licensed in Tennessee don’t show any city or state in the BPR attorney portal. Some of  these attorneys may reside in Ten-
nessee, and some may reside outside of  Tennessee but maintain licenses in Tennessee. The BPR captures this information through its annual registration 
process, and its current registration process does not allow the attorney to skip any of  the address requirements. This means there is, and will continue 
to be, a decreasing amount of  licensed attorneys who do not show any city or state in their annual reporting. However, all attorneys who completed their 
annual reporting statement but did not provide an address on file to the BPR are considered “Out-of-State Attorneys” for the purposes of  this report. 

3  The ATJ Commission has acquired pro bono reporting data for pro bono work reported in eight calendar years, 2010 to 2018. However, in 2012, the 
Tennessee Supreme Court approved a change in BPR Registration procedures to require renewals on the first day of  each attorney’s birth month. Under 
this new procedure, pro bono reporting data for the previous calendar year is not available until all reporting for that calendar year has been received. Due 
to the changes in reporting requirements in 2012, comparison data is not reliable until approximately 2013. Further, in 2018, the Tennessee Board of  Pro-
fessional Responsibility (“BPR) upgraded its database which changed the way the BPR generates its reports on annual Pro Bono Reporting data. Because 
of  the changes to the new database, some of  the information which was previously captured and reported in Tennessee’s Annual Pro Bono Report is no 
longer available. Because of  these changes, comparison data for the year 2017 may not be reliable.

4  This report only considers attorneys who completed their Annual Registration Statement by or before December 31st, 2018. It does not consider 
attorneys who failed to complete their Annual Registration Statement by or before December 31st, 2017. There may be additional attorneys who did not 
file their Annual Registration Statement by or before December 31st, 2017, whose information is not included in this report.

was a notable increase in the number and percentage of  
All Attorneys who reported pro bono. For the first time in 
the history of  this report, more than half  of  All Attorneys 
licensed in Tennessee, both those with addresses in Tennessee 
and outside of  Tennessee, reported completing pro bono 
work. This means that 51.15% percent of  all attorneys 
licensed in Tennessee reported completing one or more hour

the highest ever reported at

of  pro bono, a number reflecting a 4% increase from the 
prior year, up from 47.11%. 

Finally, in 2018, the total hours of  Pro Bono for All 
Attorneys licensed in Tennessee shows the highest number 
ever reported at 749,217 hours. This number reflects 
an increase of  50,814 hours from the prior year, and an 
increased value of  nearly $11 million dollars of  pro bono 
services.

In 2018, 22,293 total Pro Bono Reports were submitted 

to the Tennessee Board of  Professional Responsibility 
from the 22,639 total attorneys licensed in Tennessee 
(“All Attorneys”). Of  these reports, 18,073 were submitted by 
attorneys who reported addresses in the state of  Tennessee 
(“TN Attorneys”), and 4,218 were submitted by attorneys 
who either reported an address outside the state of  Tennessee 
or did not report an address (“Out-of-State Attorneys”). 

As the ATJ Commission is most interested in reviewing and 
measuring the pro bono work making a positive impact inside 
the state of  Tennessee, this report first reviews the pro bono 
hours reported by Tennessee Attorneys, and then considers 
pro bono hours reported by All Attorneys, both Tennessee 
Attorneys and Out-Of-State Attorneys. 

For the second time since the Tennessee Supreme Court 
began requesting pro bono reporting data, in 2018, more 
than half  of  Tennessee Attorneys reported completing pro 
bono hours. This year, Tennessee saw an increase in the

Attorneys who reported pro bono in 2017 (51.50%) increased 
in 2018 by more than one percentage point (52.78%). The 
number of  Tennessee attorneys who reported pro bono in 
each major category increased as well.

In 2018, 52.38% of  Tennessee Attorneys who completed their Annual Registration Statement 

for the year reported that they provided 640,958 hours of  pro bono service in 2017.5  This meant 
that 9,539 Tennessee Attorneys averaged 67.19 hours per attorney who reported completing pro bono. Assuming an 
average billing rate of  $215 per hour, this amounts to more than $137.8 million of  pro bono services provided by Tennessee 
Attorneys in 2018.6 

In addition to providing pro bono services, 20.60%, or 3,723, 
of  Tennessee Attorneys reported voluntary contributions of  
financial support to organizations providing legal services to 
persons of  limited means.

In 2018, both the percentage and number of  Tennessee Attorneys reporting pro bono increased, yielding both 
the highest number and highest percentage of  Tennessee Attorneys who reported participating in pro bono in 
the prior year since the ATJC has collected this reporting data. The number and percentage of  active Tennessee 
Attorneys who reported pro bono hours is set out in the Table One:

•  Of  the 9,539 Tennessee Attorneys who completed 640,958 hours of  Pro Bono, each reporting attorney averaged 67.19 

hours per attorney who reported completing pro bono. Of  the 18,073 total Tennessee attorneys (including those attorneys 
who reported completing zero hours), 18,073 Tennessee Attorneys averaged 35.46 hours per attorney.

• 

2018 reflects an increase of  670 Tennessee Attorneys who reported pro bono from the prior year. These numbers reflect 
an increase of  approximately 1% more attorneys who reported performing pro bono work from the prior year.

5  A few attorneys submitted Pro Bono Reports that reported an unusually high amount of  Pro Bono (greater than 2080 hours). These reports were 
handled two ways: (1) if  the attorney submitted a report greater than 8,760 hours (the maximum number of  hours in an annual year), the unusually high 
amount of  pro bono was determined likely to be a typographical error and the entire report was discarded; (2) all other Pro Bono Reports above 2080 
were counted but denoted as outliers. In 2018, two Tennessee attorneys reported more than 8,760 hours of  Pro Bono, totaling 29,400 hours. Those hours 
are not included in this report. If  they were to be included in the report, the total for hours for TN Attorneys would be 670,358. The total hours for All 
Attorneys would be 779,017. Five additional outliers are noted as reporting more than 2080 hours of  pro bono work, totaling 11,262 hours. These 11,262 
hours are included in the report which is consistent with prior methodology. 

6  As reported by the Tennessee Bar Association (TBA), hourly billing is still the most widely used pricing structure in Tennessee. Most TBA members 
(68 percent) reported that they billed clients at an hourly rate, with an average billing rate of  $274 per hour. This hourly rate is 2.6% higher than the 
average national billing rate. Nonmembers, aligned more with the national trend toward alternative fee arrangements and used different pricing structures. 
Those nonmembers who used hourly billing rates had an average billing rate of  $215 per hour. For the purposes of  this report, billable hours are calculat-
ed at a rate of  $215, which is likely a conservative hourly billing estimate for Tennessee based on the TBA data provided. More information can be found

•  Attorneys provided the most pro bono hours to persons of  limited means without a fee or at a reduced fee. 

Specifically, in 2018, 7,784 attorneys provided 442,000 hours of  pro bono services to persons of  limited means. 
Assuming an average billing rate of  $215 per hour, these hours would amount to approximately $95,030,000 
million of  free or reduced fee legal services provided to disadvantaged Tennesseans by Tennessee Attorneys. The 
table below shows the breakdown of  pro bono hours by type as reported by Tennessee Attorneys during the 2018 
Reporting Year.

•  Of  attorneys who reported providing legal services to persons of  limited means without a fee or at a reduced fee, 
the average number of  hours reported per attorney was 56.78 hours. The average number of  hours provided by 
the other three categories of  pro bono service was approximately 30 hours for each category, with groups and 
organizations at a reduced fee the highest at 34.4 hours. Table Two shows a breakdown of  the number of  Tennessee

*The total of  this column will be greater than the total number of  Tennessee Attorneys reporting pro bono work because attorneys can report pro bono 
service in multiple categories.

2012 and 2017, the method for calculating the data provided by the BPR regarding Tennessee Attorneys changed, 
which impacts that reporting year’s data. Specifically, the 2017 data marked the highest number of  hours provided 
of  pro bono in each major category in the past five years. The total hours reported in 2017 by Tennessee Attorneys 
reflected an increase from the prior year of  45,081 hours provided to persons of  limited means without a fee or at a 
reduced fee. This percent increase of  11.02% nearly doubled the percent increase of  5.9% from the prior year. The 
2018 data reflects a stabilization of  that year’s data, with numbers closer to prior reporting years. That stabilization 
could be a result of  increased accuracy by attorneys as they voluntarily report their own pro bono hours or, more 
likely, is a result of  increased accuracy in the calculation of  total hours reported by Tennessee Attorneys as reflected 
in this report.

•  Also for the first time, in 2018, the BPR reported to the ATJ Commission data provided by attorneys during their BPR 

reporting on the basis of  county. Using this data, the ATJ Commission was able to identify certain areas of  the state where 
proportionally high numbers of  Tennessee Attorneys reported completing pro bono using three different evaluation 
metrics. Three TN counties reported that 100% of  their attorneys provided pro bono, and these counties were 
Lake County, Hancock County, and Van Buren County. In addition, 70% or more of  TN Attorneys in 19 other 
counties provide pro bono services: Marshall, Jackson, White, Houston, Grundy, Fentress, Henderson, Lewis, 
Wayne, Monroe, Meigs, McNairy, Loudon, Hardin, DeKalb, Sequatchie, Haywood, Carter.

In 2018, 51.15% of  All Attorneys who completed their Annual Registration Statement for the 

year reported that they provided 749,217 hours of  pro bono service in 2017.7  This number reflected 
a 4% increase in attorney participation from the prior year, and an increase in total hours by more than 50,000 hours. 

This calculation includes the data for both Tennessee Attorneys and Out-of-State Attorneys.8 

Highlights from All Attorneys and Out-of-State Attorneys include:

• 

In 2018, for the first time both the percentage and number 
of  All Attorneys reporting pro bono increased over 50%. 
Further, the total hours reported in 2018 by All Attorneys 
increased significantly from prior years, reaching more than 
700,000 hours for the first time in reporting history.

BPR (including those attorneys who reported completing zero hours), 22,291 of  All Attorneys averaged 33.61 hours 
per attorney.

• 

2018 reflects an increase of  2,892 of  All Attorneys who reported pro bono from the prior year. These numbers reflect 
an increase of  approximately 4% more attorneys who reported performing pro bono work from the prior year.

•  All Attorneys reported providing the vast majority of  their pro bono hours to persons of  limited means without a fee 

7  A few attorneys submitted Pro Bono Reports that reported an unusually high amount of  Pro Bono (greater than 2080 hours). These reports were 
handled two ways: (1) if  the attorney submitted a report greater than 8,760 hours, the unusually high amount of  pro bono was determined likely to be 
a typographical error and the entire report was discarded; (2) all other Pro Bono Reports above 2080 were counted but denoted as outliers. In 2018, no 
Out-of-State Attorneys reported more than 8,760 or 2,080 hours of  Pro Bono. 

8  All attorneys who completed their annual reporting statement but did not provide an address on file to the BPR are considered “Out-of-State 
Attorneys” for the purposes of  this report. 102 attorneys did not provide an address to the BPR. These 102 attorneys reported 387 total hours of  pro

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionContinuing Legal Education

Supreme Court Rule 21, Section 4.08(c) permits the Tennessee Commission on Continuing Legal Education (“CLE 

Commission”) to give Ethics & Professionalism credit at the rate of  one hour of  CLE credit for every five billable hours 
of  pro bono legal representation provided. Qualifying pro bono may be provided through court appointment or an 
organized bar association program or legal services organization, or of  pro bono mediation services as required by Supreme 
Court Rule 31 or the Federal Court Mediation Programs.

The CLE Commission awarded 1,908.43 hours of  CLE credit to 1,083 attorneys for pro bono work in the 2018 Reporting 
Year. It is important to note that as opposed to the BPR reporting data, the CLE data is for pro bono work both performed 
and reported in 2018.  

Highlights of  CLE hours awarded include:

•  The 2018 data reflects both a decreased number of  attorneys received credit and a decreased amount of  CLE Credit 
for pro bono work by comparison to the 2017 year. However, the number of  hours awarded per attorney increased 
slightly from 2017 to 2018, from 1.7 hours of  CLE credit awarded per attorney in 2017 to 1.76 (1.8) hours of  CLE credit 
awarded per attorney in 2018..

•  The 2018 data continues a trend for a declining number of  CLE hours awarded for pro bono work. In fact,  2018 saw less 
CLE hours awarded for pro bono work than in either of  the prior two years. Chart Ten shows the breakdown of  CLE 
hours awarded for pro bono work in the prior years:

The declining number of  CLE Credit awarded to attorneys licensed in Tennessee is an interesting trend given the 
continued increase in numbers and hours of  All Attorneys licensed in Tennessee reporting pro bono. The trend 
could possibly suggest that the increase in pro bono over the past few years is not driven by whether CLE Credit is 
awarded for those same pro bono hours.

Using www.surveymonkey.com, the Pro Bono Coordinator surveyed the following organizations about their pro bono 

initiatives and efforts completed in the 2018 calendar year: Bar Associations, LSC-Funded Legal Service Providers, 
Non-LSC Funded Legal Service Providers, Pro Bono Legal Clinics, Law Schools, Law Firms, Tennessee Faith and 
Justice Alliance Members, and Mediation Providers. Through these 
surveys, the ATJ Commission collected 125 responses from partners 
across the state.

Report”).10  The new surveys prioritize tracking consistent 
data points and common reporting language for future 
Tennessee reporting and future national reporting.

The information and corresponding charts that follow 
highlight several questions consistently asked of  all or 
nearly all of  our partners. Following a methodology 
developed in our 2017 Report, for the 2018 Pro Bono 
Report Survey, we asked the same specific free-response 
questions of  all or nearly all partners.We have highlighted 
some of  that information in the pages that follow. These 
questions included asking all, or nearly all, partners to 
provide us with their mission or primary purpose, major 
accomplishments or successes of  their pro bono work, 
any new pro bono work with which they were affiliated, 
and any plans to expand pro bono impact in the future.

We also specifically asked four questions taken either 
directly or indirectly from the ABA Report of  all or nearly 
all of  our partners in order to continue to track and 
further refineand develop the work originally considered 
by that report. These specific results are considered in 
the aggregate for each category of  partner, and then 
specifically considered by category of  partner through the 
remainder of  the report. Companion Charts for these questions help illustrate 
some of  the responses we observed, and are intended to specifically help us identify what types of  pro bono participation our 
partners are doing, who we are serving, and who is doing specific types of  pro bono tasks in Tennessee.11

Survey Responses

We are pleased to provide the compilation 
data for multiple partners in this report. Our 
compilation data reveals some interesting trends 
highlighted below:

•  We asked six out of  the eight categories of  
partners to describe the types of  pro bono 
completed by their members in 2018. More 
than half  of  all respondents reported that 
they provided legal services without a fee or 
at a substantially reduced fee to persons of  
limited means. Additionally, forty or more 
respondents indicated that they participated in 
a legal clinic outside of  their regular job duties, 
as a trainer or teacher on legal issues, of  served 
as a speaker at a legal education event for 
non-lawyers. Chart 11 shows the breakdown 
of  partners reporting that their membership 
participated in various categories of  pro bono 
activities.

•  We asked all eight categories of  partners to 
identify several categories of  underserved, 
disadvantaged, or vulnerable Tennesseans 
served by their organizations, agencies, or 
firms in 2018. Our data revealed that the most 
frequent responses were a single parent, an 
ethnic minority, or an elderly person, with more than half  of  
respondents selecting each category. Other frequently served Tennesseans were non or limited English speakers, victims 
of  domestic violence, students, veterans, and rural residents.

The groups most commonly 
served by attorneys pro bono 
were ethnic minorities,  the 
elderly, and single parents.

•  We asked seven of  the eight categories of  partners to 
identify specific types of  pro bono legal tasks performed by 
their members in 2018. Here, more than half  of  respondents 
indicated that they reviewed or drafted documents, interviewed 

or met with the client, provided advice, and referred to other organizations. Other frequently selected answers were 
writing letters on behalf  of  the client and speaking with 
other attorneys.  Chart 13 highlights aggregate categories 
of  pro bono service reported by partners through pro 
bono services in 2018.

The most common activity 
attorneys did pro bono was

•  Finally, we asked five of  our eight categories of  partners 
if  they specialized in any particular areas of  law so 
that we could get a better idea of  the types of  services 
being performed across Tennessee by various categories of  partners. The most frequently selected category was family 
law, followed by consumer, domestic violence, elder law, health and benefits, and juvenile/education. Chart 14 shows the 
breakdown of  partners reporting that their staff  and volunteer attorneys provide services in specific categories of  law.

Survey Responses

By tracking the same questions from year to 
year, we are able to measure trends and changes 
more effectively over a period of  years. As 2018 
was our second year asking this specific set of  
questions, much of  the aggregate data looks similar 
from 2017 to 2018. However, the aggregate data 
reveals some shifts from year to year that are worth 
mentioning. 

Notably, in both 2017 and 2018, more than 50% 
of  respondents reported participating in an outside 
legal clinic or speaking at a non-legal event about 
legal issues. In 2018 both training on legal issues 
and mentoring pro bono attorneys dropped to 
below 50%, and serving as a board member or 
committee member for a legal service or Access 
to Justice related organization increased to over 
50%. Providing free or reduced fee legal services 
also increased to over 50%, which was a dramatic 
increase from the prior year.

Further, single parents, ethnic minorities, 
and elderly persons continued to be the most 
commonly served categories of  persons who were 
served by pro bono in 2018. These were also the 
three most commonly served categories of  people in 
2017, but no one category was selected by respondents 
more than 70% of  the time in 2017, where each 
category was selected more than 75% of  the time in 
2018. Additionally, in 2018, more than double the total 
categories of  people served were selected by 50% or 
more of  respondents compared to the prior year.

In addition to expanding the different types of  people 
served by pro bono in 2017 across the board, more 
types of  tasks were identified by more respondents in 
2018. Four categories of  tasks were identified by more 
than 75% of  respondents, where the most commonly 
selected tasks were chosen less than 70% of  the time in 
2017. Further, more respondents reported reviewing or 
drafting documents than speaking with other attorneys, 
which was a change from the prior year.

Finally, again in 2018, family law was by far the most 
common area of  law in which respondents reported 
providing service with no change reported from the 
prior year in this area.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionBar Associations

Most counties, metro areas, and many communities across Tennessee have bar associations that serve as resources 

for local attorneys, courts, and the public. Across the state, Bar associations in Tennessee (“Bar Associations”) 
prioritize advancing the highest values of  the legal profession.

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect the self-reported descriptions by 
bar associations of  the important work they do in their communities. In response to this year’s survey, one local bar association 
described its primary service as “an organization of  attorneys and judges whose purpose is to promote professionalism, 
collegiality, diversity and integrity in the legal system. It serves as a valuable resource to its members and the public by 
facilitating relationships, encouraging interaction, providing access to justice and offering educational and wellness programs to 
support members’ efforts to reach their personal and professional goals..”

Another bar association said that they “provide service to the public specifically including access to justice legal aid events. 
Provide a service to our members to further educate them on our local practice and procedure, as well as provide them with a 
social setting to engage with one another.”

A third bar association said that they “consistently [provide] services to lawyers and [have] helped make the practice of  law 
better for its members by providing continuing legal education programs and opportunities to serve the community.”

Many Bar Associations offer volunteer opportunities for attorneys to provide pro bono and/or reduced fee services. Bar 
Associations are particularly valuable resources to pro bono initiatives statewide as each Bar Association has unique knowledge 
about its community and ways to mobilize the local bar for initiatives such as clinics, pro se days, and larger statewide 
initiatives.

To your knowledge, did one or more members of  your Bar Association 
participate in any of  the following pro bono activities in 2017?

This report considers responses from 15 Bar 
Associations across Tennessee.

Highlights from Bar Associations include: 

•  Fifteen Bar Associations reported an 
estimated average of  58 attorneys per 
bar association who volunteer for pro 
bono programs and 63 average additional 
volunteers for pro bono programs per 
bar association (individuals who are not 
attorneys but volunteer through the bar 
association programs). These reporting 
Bar Associations total nearly 1,000 total 
volunteers for pro bono programs through 
reporting Bar Associations, or 10% of  their 
total membership.

•  Ten Bar Associations reported that at least 

25% of  their membership participated in pro 
bono activities, and eight Bar Associations

they actively encourage pro bono participation to their memberships. The most frequent way Bar Associations 
report encouraging pro bono participation is through pro bono recognition programs, Bar Association pro bono 
programming, and by providing lists of  available opportunities.

Several Bar Associations reported specific initiatives:

•  The Knoxville Bar Association reported that the Knoxville Barristers continued to sponsor monthly veterans legal 

advice clinics and quarterly Faith & Justice and Debt Relief  Legal Clinics. Lawyers and law students who participate 
in these clinics may not typically take a pro bono case through Legal Aid of  East Tennessee or through one of  the local 
law schools, so this project has been successful at increasing the number of  lawyers performing pro bono legal services 
through legal advice clinics.

  The Napier Looby Bar Association reported that Napier-Looby hosted a free legal clinic in collaboration with the 

Legal Aid Society of  Middle Tennessee and Watson Grove Baptist. The bar association will have another free clinic 
focused on wills and estates in the fall of  2019. Through encouraging members to participate in legal clinics/pro bono 
opportunities, Napier-Looby extended its expertise to individuals and communities beyond its primary membership 
base. 

•  The Memphis Bar Association reported that it continued the 2nd Saturday Free Legal Clinic, which is now in its 12th 
year of  operation. It also supported the Veteran’s Legal Clinic held monthly and assisted with expungement and 
restoration of  rights clinics. The Memphis Bar Association combined a training on common pro bono issues with a 
pro bono recognition luncheon in October 2018, that was well attended. Additionally, the Memphis Bar Association 
reported that it received a Tennessee Legal Initiatives Fund (TILF) grant from the Tennessee Bar Foundation to create 
a portal/app for those seeking legal help/advice. The goal is to help them get the assistance they need more efficiently 
and quickly. The bar association hopes to address the needs of  indigent clients by working with the courts on affidavits 
of  indigency.

•  The Nashville Bar Association reported that it conducts a two hour service once a month for the public to call in and 

speak with an attorney at no cost.

•  The Blount County Bar Association reported that unserved members of  the community were provided with free or low 
cost services. It reported that it would be helpful to have a database of  pro bono opportunities that could be updated 
by providers in each county so that attorneys and law students had one place to go to volunteer.

•  The Cheatham County Bar Association reported that it is a small bar, currently not very active  which means there is 
not coordinated pro bono work by the bar association; however, the bar association reports that most of  the attorneys 
do provide services in the community.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionLegal Services Corporation Funded 

In Tennessee, there are four primary legal aid providers that receive federal funding from the Legal Services Corporation 

(“LSC”) to provide general civil legal help regionally in Tennessee (“LSC Providers”).12   These organizations are Legal 
Aid of  East Tennessee, Legal Aid Society of  Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands, Memphis Area Legal Services, and 

West Tennessee Legal Services. These LSC Providers play an integral role in providing Access to Justice in the state and in 
matching pro bono clients with attorneys through their staff  and pro bono networks. 

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect the self-reported descriptions 
by LSC Providers of  the important work they do in their communities. In response to this year’s survey, one LSC Provider 
described its mission and primary service as “to advance, defend, and enforce the legal rights of  low-income and vulnerable 
people in order to secure for them the basic necessities of  life.” 

Other LSC Providers provided similar descriptions of  their work including “providing excellence in legal advocacy for those in 
need” and “strengthening communities and changing lives through high-quality legal services.”

In what areas of  law does your organization offer services?

In addition to direct services provided by LSC 
Provider staff, many LSC Providers offer pro bono 
clinic programs and opportunities for volunteer 
attorneys to provide pro bono and/or reduced fee 
services. LSC Providers provide critical services and 
leadership to the state of  Tennessee, both through 
their staff  and pro bono programs.

This report considers responses from all LSC 
Providers in Tennessee.

Highlights from LSC Providers include:

•  LSC Providers reported having 234 staff  

Family

members including 99 staff  attorneys. The 
organizations reported 1,224 volunteers for 
pro bono programs, including 1,098 pro bono 
attorneys for programs in 2018. These numbers 
reflect a reduction in staff, volunteers, and pro 
bono attorneys from 2017 to 2018. The number 
of  reported staff  attorneys did not increase or 
decrease from 2017 to 2018.

There is one additional LSC-Funded Provider, Southern Migrant Legal Services, which serves Tennessee as well as other states in the Southeast

region. As Southern Migrant Legal Services is specialized in its services, for the purposes of  this report, Southern Migrant Legal Services has 
historically been considered in the “Other Legal Service Providers – Non-LSC Funded & Specialized” category of  this report. Southern Migrant 
Legal Services did not complete the Pro Bono Report Survey for 2018.

Outside of  your staff ’s paid job responsibilities, did your staff  members or 
volunteers participate in any of  the following in 2017?

•  Three LSC Providers reported that 

their pro bono programs served 1,042 
clients through legal clinics in 2018, with 
729 clients matched with limited scope 
representation, 264 clients matched with 
an attorney for full representation, and 82 
clients served another way.

•  All LSC Providers reported that their staff  
or volunteers participated in or supported 
legal clinics outside of  their regular job 
duties. All four LSC Providers also reported 
that their staff  or volunteers served as 
trainers or teachers on legal issues, as 
speakers at legal education events, as 
members of  boards and bar committees, 
and as members committees related to pro 
bono or access to justice. Those providers 
also reported that their staff  or volunteers 
provided supervising or mentorship 
to other attorneys providing pro bono 
representation. Chart 19 shows the

•  Legal Aid of  East Tennessee (LAET) reported 59 staff  members including 25 attorneys. It reported 333 

volunteers for pro bono programs, including 283 pro bono attorneys for 2018. LAET pro bono programs served 
741 clients through legal clinics, 464 clients through limited scope representation, and 34 clients through full 
representation.
•  LAET reported that its clinics provide free legal advice to low income members of  our community who 

might otherwise have no legal assistance. LAET’s Debt Relief  Clinics provide clients with the opportunity to 
hear from our area’s Bankruptcy Judge and to meet one-on-one with attorneys who specialize in bankruptcy/
debt law and who frequently agree to assist clients through the bankruptcy process.

•  LAET also reported that, in 2018, the organization continued and expanded its established programs. LAET 
held clinics in conjunction with several houses of  faith throughout Knoxville, reaching more than 200 clients. 
In addition to developing Debt Relief  Clinics, LAET maintained successful Veterans Advice Clinics and 
Faith and Justice clinics. At one Faith and Justice Clinic in December, LAET saw more than 100 clients.

•  Legal Aid Society of  Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands (LASMTC) reported 81 staff  members, including 
34 attorneys. It reported 479 volunteers for pro bono programs, including 436 pro bono attorneys for 2018. 
LASMTC pro bono programs served 557 clients through legal clinics, 398 clients through limited scope 
representation, 60 clients through full representation, and 22 clients another way.
•  LASMTC reported that, in 2018, its Gallatin Clinic continued to grow in its impact to the community from 
5 clinics in 2017 to 8 clinics in 2018, and included, at the request of  the Clerk & Master and  Circuit Court 
Clerk, assistance for self-represented litigants in divorce. It also reported haivng over 20 clinics in four 
counties in the more rural part of  our service area. For example, LASMTC held a Legal Help Clinic in 

30

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionLegal Services Corporation Funded 

Columbia which included assistance for self-represented litigants in divorce. LASMTC also held a Tennessee 
Senior Law Alliance (TSLA) Legal Help Clinic at St. Clair Senior Center in Murfreesboro with Nashville School 
of  Law students and alums. LASMTC’s clinic in Franklin was aided by staff  at the Mercy Clinic providing staff  that 
translate since this clinic serves a high percentage of  non-English speaking patrons. LASMTC also held a 
Faith & Justice Legal Help Clinic at Corinthian Missionary Baptist Church with students from Belmont and 
lawyers from Harpeth Hills Church of  Christ.

•  LASMTC reported new projects including (1) Working to establish regular monthly clinics in the service areas 
where we have offices that at the present do not have a regular clinic; (2) Establishing a monthly downtown 
Nashville clinic in partnership with the Nashville Library starting September 4, 2019.

•  Memphis Area Legal Services (MALS) reported 51 staff  members including 22 attorneys. It reported 332 volunteers 
for pro bono programs, including 332 pro bono attorneys for 2018. MALS pro bono programs served 404 clients 
through legal clinics, 177 clients through limited scope representation, and 47 clients through full representation in 
2018. 
•  MALS’ pro bono legal advice clinics continued to flourish in 2018. MALS created a new medical-legal 

partnership with the University of  Tennessee Health & Sciences Center and Rhodes to provide health and 
legal services. Further, we began our Restoration of  Rights Project, a partnership with the University of  
Memphis, Cecil C. Humphreys School of  Law to provide re-entry services. MALS now offers assistance with 
driver license reinstatement, criminal court cost waivers, expungements, and voter restoration.
•  MALS’ main focus in 2019 has been building and refining the Restoration of  Rights Project. The 

community was extremely responsive to the Project and requests for services have rapidly increased since 
the implementation.  In 2019 we have focused on providing trainings for pro bono attorneys to increase 
participation and forging partnerships with other community organizations that can compliment the 
program’s services.

•  West Tennessee Legal Services (WTLS) reported 43 staff  members including 18 attorneys. It reported 80 

volunteers for pro bono programs including 47 pro bono attorneys for 2018. WTLS  did not report the number of  
clients served in 2018.
•  WTLS reported several successes from its program in 2018, including increasing pro bono cases (accepted 
by pro bono attorneys) by 183% (from 68 cases in 2017 to 193 cases in 2018). We also increased the number 
of  private attorneys accepting pro bono cases by almost 60% in 2018 and the number of  private attorneys 
volunteering at clinics by 80%.

•  WTLS reported continuing monthly clinics at RIFA Soup Kitchen in Jackson (civil legal clinic), the Military 
Monday Legal Clinic at Starbucks in Jackson, and the Legal Clinic at Reelfoot Rural Ministries Thrift Store 
in Lake County held quarterly. In 2018, WTLS was awarded a grant by the West TN Healthcare Foundation 
to hold a weekly legal clinic at our local Jackson-Madison County Library. Once the grant ended, we have 
continued the clinic monthly at the library. WTLS also held an Expungement Clinic in Haywood County in 
2018.

•  We have recently received a VOCA3 grant and have implemented the pro bono portion of  that grant. We have 
“low”-bono pro bono attorneys who have agreed to accept an exceptionally reduced rate in order to assist our 
clients needing either modification of  parenting plans or establishment of  parenting plans in juvenile courts. 
These clients are either victims of  domestic violence, coercive control after separation or have children in the 
home who have been exposed to abuse and/or illegal drug use. With the implementation of  this program 
(VOCA3-CAP – “Contract Attorney Program”), we are able to help more victims of  domestic violence through 
the Pro Bono Project at WTLS than we would otherwise be able to help.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionNon-LSC Funded & Specialized Providers

In what areas of  law does your organization offer services?

Like LSC Providers, non-LSC funded 

and specialized legal service providers 
(“Legal Providers”) play an integral role in 
providing access to justice in the state, particularly 
by focusing on providing specialized services and 
advocacy that LSC Providers are unable to provide. 

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to 
our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect the 
self-reported descriptions by Legal Providers of  the 
important work they do in their communities. In 
response to this year’s survey, one Legal Provider 
described their primary service as “to provide civil 
legal services to those with limited means and those 
at risk, including populations not served by other 
legal aid agencies. We serve Shelby County residents 
through our civil program, elder law program, 
and pro se divorce clinic. Through our immigrant 
justice program, we serve immigrants living within 
the Memphis Immigration Court’s jurisdiction 
(Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Mississippi).”

Other Legal Providers provided similarly specific 
descriptions of  their work including ending 
“domestic and sexual violence through public 
policy, education and direct legal services,” 
“protecting and improving the laws, policies, and 
programs which provide dignity and opportunity, 
including access to health care and food,” and 
“strengthen[ing] the delivery of  civil legal help to 
vulnerable Tennesseans. We do this by: Simplifying 
the search for civil legal help; Being a leading 
and unifying voice; and Establishing a center for 
innovation, training, and expertise.”

Legal Providers serve an especially valuable role in 
Tennessee Access to Justice Initiatives because they 
can often serve segments of  the population and 
handle legal matters that LSC Providers cannot. 
Non-LSC-funded organizations do not have to 
follow federal income guidelines to determine if  
a person is eligible to receive legal services, and 
are not subject to the same restrictions that an 
LSC funded organization must observe in case 
selection. This allows many Legal Providers to 
provide enhanced access to legal care to many 
disadvantaged and vulnerable populations who 
might not otherwise get help.

categories of  disadvantaged or vulnerable Tennesseans served by their pro bono programs in 2018. Legal Providers most 
frequently reported serving an ethnic minority and an elderly person. Chart 24 highlights some of  the people served by 
Legal Providers through pro bono services in 2018.

•  Five Legal Providers identified one or more categories of  legal tasks provided through their pro bono programs in 2018. 
The most commonly occurring legal tasks reported were reviewing or drafting documents, writing letters, and providing 
advice. Chart 22 highlights some categories of  pro bono reported by Legal Providers through pro bono programs in 2018.

•  When asked what other resources are needed by Legal Providers, the most common answers are increased funding to hire 

more staff  attorneys, paralegals and assistance, and infrastructure.

Several Legal Providers reported specific initiatives:
•  The Arts and Business Council of  Greater Nashville (Volunteer Lawyers & Professionals for the Arts) (VLPA) 

reported three staff  members including one attorney and reported 164 volunteers for pro bono programs including 
159 pro bono attorneys for 2018. VLPA pro bono programs served 32 clients through legal clinics, 32 clients through 
limited scope representation, 48 clients through full representation, 6 clients through reduced fee representation, 
and 235 clients another way in 2018.
•  VLPA reported that its 2018 program provided pro bono legal services to low-income artists of  all disciplines, 
as well as legal and business assistance to emerging nonprofit arts organizations through the VLPA program.

•  VLPA reports that in 2018 the organization hired a dedicated staff  attorney to staff  our pro bono program. 

This is the first time VLPA has had a dedicated staff  attorney. It noted that as a future and ongoing initiative, 
it plans to hold more legal clinics as a result of  this new staffing.

•  Community Legal Center (CLC) reported 15 staff  members including seven attorneys. It reported 108 volunteers 

for pro bono programs including 84 pro bono attorneys for 2018. CLC pro bono programs served 92 clients through 
limited scope representation and 51 clients through full representation in 2018.
•  CLC reported that their Pro Bono Coordinator places civil cases in Shelby County and full or partial 

immigration matters across Tennessee, Arkansas, and northern Mississippi. CLC’s Pro Bono Coordinator 
planned and implemented four CLE courses throughout 2018 and recruited a total of  40 new volunteer 
attorneys. Additionally, she worked to place each volunteer attorney with an experienced mentor and/or 
interpreter when necessary. She was able to successfully place all pro bono cases screened by CLC with a 
volunteer attorney where appropriate.

•  CLC reported that through a Corporate Counsel Pro Bono Initiative grant, CLC is planning on partnering with 

corporate legal departments to provide pro bono representation to civil clients through clinics.

•  Tennessee Alliance for Legal Services (TALS) reported eleven staff  members, including nine attorneys. It reported 

815 volunteers for pro bono programs including 815 pro bono attorneys for 2018. TALS pro bono programs served 
1,561 clients through limited scope representation in 2018.
•  TALS reported that its primary pro bono program in 2018 was TN Free Legal Answers. The concept of  TN 

Free Legal Answers is a web-based pro bono clinic for low-income Tennesseans who might otherwise fall 
through the cracks of  receiving legal assistance. Using a web-based platform, qualifying users can post 
questions about their civil legal needs and receive basic legal information and advice from attorneys. The 
website is easy-to-use and is convenient for both volunteer attorneys and low-income Tennesseans. The goal 
of  this project is twofold: to increase access to justice for low-income Tennesseans, particularly in rural areas 
and to remove barriers to attorneys providing pro bono services. 
In 2018, TALS expanded its networks and partnerships to work  with law students, corporate counsel, and law 
firms to help disadvantaged Tennesseans get answers to their legal questions.

•  Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence (TCDSV) reported 22 staff  members, including four 

attorneys. It reported six volunteers for pro bono programs and four pro bono attorneys for 2018. TCDSV pro bono 
programs served fifty-seven clients through full representation, five clients by reduced fee representation, and 360 
clients served another way in 2018.

•  Grant funded legal staff  at TCDSV provide legal services to low income victims of  domestic and sexual 

violence at no charge per grant restrictions and approved scope of  services. TCDSV staff  was successful in 
getting information out about its Sexual Assault/DV Legal Clinic and Immigration Clinic (for victims of  
Domestic Violence) in order to provide legal representation to those who could not afford legal representation. 

•  TCDSV will continue to assist victims of  domestic violence or sexual assault who do not qualify for TCDSV 
grant funded services in finding services. TCDSV staff  will also continue to provide free (grant funded) legal 
representation to victims of  domestic and sexual violence and will continue partnering and collaborating 
with other agencies/organizations that provide services to Domestic Violence or Sexual Assault victims. 
Future pro bono projects include working with college campuses to provide information, resources and legal 
representation, as appropriate, to victims of  DV or sexual assault. In addition, TCDSV will partner with other 
organizations to have a legal clinic housed at the organization for victims that cannot meet with an attorney 
during “normal working” hours.

•  Tennessee Justice Center (TJC) reported 20 staff  members including four attorneys. It reported 30 volunteers for 

pro bono programs, including 20 pro bono attorneys for 2018. TJC pro bono programs served 17 clients through full 
representation in 2018.
•  TJC reported that it has a roster of  potential pro bono attorneys to represent our clients in administrative 

appeals, judicial review of  administrative decisions in Chancery Court, and federal court. 

•  TJC reported that in 2018 it successfully secured pro bono representation to all of  our clients who needed it.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionPro Bono Legal Advice Clinics

A legal clinic is an excellent opportunity for attorneys with limited time or experience to provide pro bono services 

and to network with other attorneys. Across the state, legal clinics (“Clinic Providers”) provide limited scope legal 
assistance to those in need, often on a walk-in basis. 

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect the self-reported descriptions 
by Clinic Providers of  the important work they do in their communities. In response to this year’s survey, one Clinic Provider 
described their primary service as to “serve low income members of  our community, including victims of  domestic violence, 
the elderly, veterans, and families through Pro Bono service..” 

Other Clinic Providers provided similar descriptions of  their work including “to advance, defend and enforce the legal rights 
of  low-income and vulnerable people in order to secure for them the basic necessities of  life,” “to provide access to legal 
assistance and services to people who cannot afford an attorney, and hopefully create solutions for those who otherwise would 
not have that access due to financial barriers.,” and “to provide holistic, full representation to low income elderly clients.”

Clinics serve a dual triage purpose: they provide limited scope legal counsel and advice and often connect individuals with 
more extended legal representation. Clients who participate in a legal clinic are generally able to sit with an attorney to receive 
legal advice and information and discuss their needs, remedies, and next steps.

Please select if  you served one or more of  the following persons through pro 
bono programs in 2017:

The ATJ Commission maintains a list of  clinics 
across the state. The list is available online on 
the Access to Justice Website, www.justiceforalltn.
com. Some of  the Clinic Providers also fall into 
other report categories such as Bar Associations, 
Law Schools, and LSC-Funded Legal Service 
Providers.  

This report considers responses from nine Clinic 
Providers across the state. 

Clinic Provider responses included three general 
civil legal clinics, four specialized clinics, and 
two legal clinic programs with both general 
and specialized services. Of  those responses, 
two responses were from clinics serving West 
Tennessee, two were from clinics serving Middle 
Tennessee, and five were from clinics serving East 
Tennessee. Three responses were clinics affiliated 
with a university or law school, two were clinics 
affiliated with a LSC Provider, two were clinics 
affiliated with a Bar Association, one was a clinic 
affiliated with a court, and one  was affiliated with 
a non-profit not previously identified.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionPro Bono Legal Advice Clinics

Several Clinic Providers reported specific initiatives:

•  Catholic Charities of  TN, Inc. reported that their clinic programs provide an upper level of  expertise on immigration 
matters. In 2018, through Catholic Charities clinic programs, clients were able to talk with attorney at no cost to 
determine if  they could move forward in the immigration system. 

•  The Community Economic Development Clinic of  the University of  Tennessee College of  Law reported that 
it provides free transactional legal services (i.e., not litigation) to small businesses, nonprofit organizations, 
entrepreneurs, and artists. Projects include business formation, contract drafting and negotiation, intellectual 
property protection, employment issues, and tax-exempt applications.

•  The Dial-A-Lawyer Program of  the Nashville Bar Association reported that its long-standing Dial-A-Lawyer clinic 
is a completely free, no-strings-attached public service that takes place on the first Tuesday of  every month in 
Davidson County. Licensed volunteer attorneys are available to answer legal questions from members of  the public.

•  The Elder Clinic of  University of  Memphis School of  Law reported that it provides civil legal assistance to low-
income elders, offering full representation required to achieve satisfactory resolution and providing holistic 
representation whenever possible. The Elder Law Clinic reported that in 2018, the clinic was able to obtain 
conservatorship on behalf  of  a number of  elderly parents seeking to protect adult children with disabilities and 
assisted numerous clients in drafting wills and Power of  Attorneys. One particularly notable success included 
obtaining a probate court ruling on behalf  of  a client enabling her to obtain title to a vehicle worth $7,000 that she 
had in fact paid for, but had put her brother’s name on (with his permission) because he had better credit. Clinic 
students presented community legal education presentations on access to long term care and financial exploitation.

•  The Kingsport Bar Association, the Johnson City Office of  Legal Aid of  East TN (“LAET”), and the Tennessee 

Bar Association Young Lawyers Division of  the Kingsport Bar Clinic reported that the assistance given by volunteer 
attorneys at the Kingsport Bar Association Clinic primarily involve issues in the following areas: Domestic (divorce/
custody), landlord/tenant/rent,consumer debt/collections problems,property disputes, wills/estate inquiries, 
employment problems, and workers’ compensation. The clinic reported that in 2018, it assisted well over 100 people 
who otherwise would not have been able to afford a lawyer or who generally did not have access to legal services.

•  The Juvenile Court of  Shelby County reported that in 2018, it provided legal information to non-custodial parents 

with child support and or parenting time issues.

•  The University of  Tennessee College of  Law Family Mediation Clinic reported that by partnering with the Knox 
County Community Mediation Center, clinic students co-mediate cases with experienced volunteers. These cases 
are filed in the Knox County General Sessions and Juvenile Courts, and they involve landlord–tenant, services, 
property damage, and parenting-related disputes. By providing mediation services to low-income and other legally 
underserved groups, the Mediation Clinic provides a valuable community service.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionLaw School Sponsored Pro Bono Programs

Outside of  your staff ’s paid job responsibilities, did your staff  or volunteers 
participate in the following pro bono activities in 2017?

Tennessee is proud to report that 

for the second year in a row every 
law school in the state reported 

that Access to Justice is a top priority at their 
institution, and this priority continues to be 
evident in Tennessee law school (“Law School”) 
sponsored pro bono programs. 

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to 
our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect the 
self-reported descriptions by Law Schools of  the 
important work they do in their communities. In 
response to this year’s survey, one Law School 
described its primary service as “to educate 
leaders who contribute to the advancement of  
justice. To achieve this goal we provide students 
with a rigorous program of  legal education, in 
an intellectually vibrant community of  teaching 
and scholarly excellence that prepares them for 
admission to the bar and for effective, ethical, 
and responsible participation as members of  the 
legal profession.” 

Other Law Schools provided similar 
descriptions of  their work including “to 
help students develop an awareness of  their 
future ethical and professional responsibilities 
as they provide service to their community,” 
“to produce practice ready attorneys to work 
in underserved communities that are currently 
without an adequate number of  attorneys and/
or legal services,” and “ to provide an affordable, 
intellectually rigorous, and practice-oriented legal 
education. As the sole law school in the heart 
of  one of  America’s great cities, we commit 
ourselves to community engagement and to 
empowering our diverse community to pursue 
justice as a moral virtue and a social good.”

Ever since the launch of  its first Strategic Plan 
in 2012, the ATJ Commission has acknowledged 
the importance of  introducing pro bono services 
to future attorneys while they are still in Law 
School. Attorneys who performed pro bono 
work in Law School report that it made them 
more likely or far more likely to participate in

attorneys from our clinic programs report 
that law student participation in their clinics 
brings valuable energy and enthusiasm to their 
programs. 

This report considers responses from all Law 
Schools in Tennessee.

Highlights from Law Schools include:

•  Law Schools reported 2,181 law students 

enrolled in their institutions in 2018, and a 
total of  1,181 law students involved with 
pro bono in 2018. This means that law 
schools report that over half  (54.18%) 
of  their law students participate in pro 
bono and reflects a slight increase from 
the statewide Tennessee Attorney and All 
Attorney numbers reported by the BPR. 
Law Schools in Tennessee reported 360

•  Again in 2018, Law Schools reported that they did not consistently track how many clients were served through pro 

bono programs at their institutions; however, more Law Schools reported estimated numbers of  clients served than the 
prior year. Of  the Law Schools who provided estimates, Law Schools estimated more than 550 clients served through 
clinic programs and approximately 100 clients matched with an attorney for limited scope representation. One law school 
reported serving 5-10 additional clients through clinics and externships which provide full representation. 

•  Two Law Schools reported a total of  9,558 hours of  pro bono provided to individuals, with one law school reporting 
over 9,000 of  those hours, and another Law School reported providing 5,809 hours of  limited scope pro bono to 
organizations.

•  All Law Schools reported that at least 25% of  their students participated in pro bono programs. Four Law Schools 

reported that at least 25-49% of  their students participate in pro bono programs, one law school reported that 75-98% of  
their students participated in pro bono programs, and one Law School reported that 99-100% of  their students participate 
in pro bono programs.

100% of  Law Schools reported that they actively encourage students to participate in pro bono activities through 
recognition programs for pro bono participation and school sponsored pro bono programs. Chart 31 highlights some 
of  the ways that Law Schools encourage students to participate in pro bono programs.

Several Law Schools reported specific initiatives:

•  Belmont University College of  Law (BCL) reported 25-49% of  students and 75-98% of  faculty participated 
in pro bono in 2018. BCL reported that it encourages students to participate in pro bono activities through 
recognition programs, school sponsored pro bono programming, lists of  opportunities, pro bono participation 
from faculty and staff  including law school deans, recommended pro bono goals for all students, and 
participation in the Law Students for Justice Program.

• 

In 2018, BCL programs partnered with numerous outside organizations including the Tennessee 
Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRCC), Compassionate Counsel, Tennessee Alliance for Legal 
Services (TALS), and Legal Aid Society of  Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. Highlights included 
the launch of  a successful program with community partners including Legal Aid Society of  Middle 
Tennessee and the Cumberlands to provide assistance to indigent women in need of  restraining orders 
in domestic violence related matters. BLC pro bono programs also saw an increased level of  student 
involvement among upper-level law students.

•  Future pro bono projects include the launch of  a course that will involve a new medical-legal partnership

program providing legal services to clients screened and referred by medical professionals for legal needs.. One 
of  the medical clinics for this partnership program will be the Vanderbilt Geriatric Outpatient Center. Students 
working at this location will be providing advice regarding preparation of  durable powers of  attorney for health 
care and for finances and may also involve preparation of  advance care directives and other wills and estate 
matters. The second clinic will be the free clinic at Mercury Courts in north Nashville that will provide services 
to individuals, many of  whom are homeless or formerly homeless, who have been identified as having health 
harming legal needs.

In what areas of  law does your organization offer services?

Tennessee law firms (“Law Firms”) play a 

special role in supporting pro bono programs 
in Tennessee. From the smallest to largest, 

Law Firms across the state serve their communities and 
facilitate the pro bono work of  their attorneys. 

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to our Pro 
Bono Surveying designed to collect the self-reported 
descriptions by Law Firms of  the important work 
they do in their communities. In response to this year’s 
Survey, one Law Firm explained that that their firm 
“provides legal services to groups and individuals whose 
resources are limited. [E]fforts include work on a wide 
range of  matters, such as advocating for the homeless 
and organizations that serve the homeless, providing 
corporate legal services to non-profit organizations, 
collaborating with our clients to address particular 
community needs, and much more.”

Other Law Firms provided similar descriptions of  their 
work including “engaging in as much pro bono work 
as possible, [for example], volunteer[ing] for several 
not-for-profits and participate in local and state bar 
committees,” ”support[ing] people and groups 
in need of  legal representation [incuding] death 
penalty cases, adoptions, evictions, human 
rights, privacy rights, prisoner rights, services for 
people in recovery from addiction, representation 
of  start-up charitable nonprofits, and intellectual 
property work for low-income inventors, 
artists and entertainers,” and “helping meet the 
critical needs of  individuals, nonprofits and 
organizations. Our pro bono work spans multiple 
areas, including children’s initiatives, community 
development, civil rights, supporting not for 
profits, and working with victims of  human 
trafficking and anti-trafficking organizations.”

Among many other ways to encourage pro bono, 
Tennessee’s Pillar Law Firm model formalizes 
a more efficient way for Law Firms to accept 
referrals for pro bono services by training specific 
Law Firms to accept pro bono assignments within 
particular high-demand areas of  law. The ATJ 
Commission is interested in understanding the 
particular needs and resources of  Law Firms in 
order to continue to maximize the impact that

worship. The TFJA connects religious communities 
with legal communities in various forms across 
the state on a case by case basis; developing and 
planting clinic projects, assisting with pro bono 
referral projects, connecting resources, conducting 
trainings for pastoral leadership and CLE 
opportunities, conducting interpreter and mediator 
trainings, and more. The TFJA not only expands 
and complements the existing network of  pro 
bono services provided in the state, in some cases, 
the TFJA can be effective in providing pro bono 
resources to communities in new ways that might 
not be effective otherwise.

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question 
to our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect 
the self-reported descriptions by Faith-Based 
Providers of  the important work they do in their 
communities. In response to this year’s survey, 
one Faith-Based Provider described their primary 
service as to “empower, educate and motivate 
men and women to overcome low self-esteem, 
unemployment, and hopelessness through various 
conferences and clinics designed to restore fullness 
of  life.”

Other Faith-Based Providers provided similar 
descriptions of  their work including “bringing 
together diverse immigrant communities 
throughout the state to examine root causes, 
find common interests, and organize for better 
conditions,” “building a strong, welcoming, and 
inclusive Tennessee,” “providing advice clinic 
services,” and “lifting up the voices of  directly 
affected people… to ensure our theory of  change is

Several Faith-Based Providers reported specific initiatives:

•  The Tennessee Video Clinic Project reported that it is a project of  the ATJC that is strategically designed to allow peo-
ple who may not be able to make it into a standing legal clinic to get legal help virtually. The TN Video Clinic Project 
was under development in 2018 and began accepting cases in March 2019. 

•  W.O.M.B. Ministries is a 501(C)3 non-profit organization dedicated to ministering to the needs of  hurting and broken 
women, men and their families. W.O.M.B.’s purpose is to minister life, hope and the healing love of  God to those who 
are dying mentally, emotionally and spiritually; due to unresolved past hurts, wounds, dependencies, and addictive 
behavior. We address these needs by providing: Spiritual Counseling Job Readiness Training Financial Management 
Empowerment Retreats & Conferences . W.O.M.B. reported that its main accomplishments in 2018 were two Expunge-
ment Clinics held in Montgomery County which were very successful to restoring many lives by restoring individuals 
rights to vote, their dignity and possible housing and many other life needs.

•  Lipscomb’s Institute of  Law and Society program provides legal advice clinics at St. James Missionary Baptist Church 
and Schrader Lane Church of  Christ. Lipscomb has held these partnerships for several years, and the numbers of  
clients have continued to grow at Schrader Lane. Lipscomb reports that it hopes to host more free legal clinics in the 
future.

•  The Music City Community Court reported a great number of  participants and volunteers in 2018. The work of  the 

Music City Community Court allows individuals the opportunity to proceed with record Expungement; driver’s license 
reinstatement, restoration of  voters rights, access to housing, food and jobs. In 2018, the Music City Community Court 
received the 2018 Community Court Grant to receive technical assistance from the United States Department of  Jus-
tice, Bureau of  Justice Assistance with the Center for Court Innovation in partnership with the ATJC to implement a 
New Diversionary Court namedC.A.R.E. (Creating Avenues for Restoration & Empowerment) for Ages 18-30. 

•  The Music City Community Court is currently the process of  creating the Bordeaux North Community Justice Center 
which will be the designated space for the General Sessions Music City Community Court, Division VIII (8). The 
Court will have civil, traffic and C.A.R.E. court cases handled in this space as well as our Saturday Court Dockets for 
our Expungement/ Legal Clinics, Indigency, Community Service Work Dockets and Resource Fairs.

•  Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) reports that through an empowerment model TIRRC 

assists individuals and families to overcome obstacles, access opportunities, and become powerful leaders in their com-
munities. Through TIRRC’s resource referral program, TIRRC provides information and answers questions in mul-
tiple languages via phone, hotline, text message, email and social media, offering referrals on a variety of  topics from 
legal assistance and crisis response to education and housing. In TIRRC’s legal services program, TIRRC supports 
immigrants and refugees through referrals to trusted legal service providers and private attorneys, and hosts frequent 
application assistance workshops to pair attorneys with families in need of  low-cost, high-quality assistance in apply-
ing for types of  legal status. 

•  Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) also reported that in 2018, TIRRC made 5,000 resource 
referrals to immigrants needing assistance, many of  them in search of  legal support. TIRRC conducted intakes after 
immigration enforcement interactions for over 100 families, then made referrals to partner attorneys (not including the 
raid support below). This team also implemented group processing workshops to assist immigrant families complete 
more than 900 powers of  attorney. A focus of  TIRRC’s work in 2018 was the April raid in Bean Station, Tennessee. Our 
community education, legal services, and community partnerships were all activated in service of  this rural immigrant 
community. For the first two weeks, TIRRC hosted legal clinics every day for families, where TIRRC provided immi-
gration screenings, assisted in locating relatives, created powers of  attorney for their minors, and identified other legal 
issues such as custody and previous criminal charges.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionMediation Providers – Community 
Mediation Centers & Rule 31 

Mediation can serve as an appealing way to resolve legal disputes particularly for those who may be unable to afford 

representation or for whom litigation is likely to be lengthy. Tennessee has many providers who offer free or 
reduced cost mediations that mediations serve as an important pro bono resource in Tennessee. 

In Tennessee, there are two major types of  pro bono mediation opportunities: (1) Non-profit community mediation centers 
that provide pro bono mediation services to residents across the state (“Mediation Providers”), and (2) Rule 31 Mediators, 
where individuals provide pro bono mediation services pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 31 (“Rule 31 Mediators”).

Mediation Providers often partner with local courts to provide a range of  free or low-cost (sliding scale) mediations to those 
who are most vulnerable in the court system. The Administrative Office of  the Courts supports these centers through limited 
grant funding designed to increase low-income Tennesseans’ access to mediation services.14  

Starting in 2018, we added a specific question to our Pro Bono Surveying designed to collect the self-reported descriptions 
by Mediation Providers of  the important work they do in their communities. In response to this year’s survey,  one Mediation 
Provider described its primary service as to “provide free access to justice through mediation.” 

Other Mediation Providers provided similar descriptions of  their work including providing “mediation in adult and juvenile 
courts in the counties served as well as conflict resolution education,” to” provide assistance to the judicial system when they 
adjudicate high-conflict cases,” and to “break multi-generational cycles of  child abuse, neglect, and trauma.”

This report considers responses from seven Mediation 
Providers across Tennessee.

volunteer mediators for pro bono programs, were 
able to serve over 658 clients with free mediations, 9 
clients with reduced fee mediation, and 3,010 clients 
another way in 2018.

to mediation. The first is the Victim Offender Mediation Program 
(VORP). The Tennessee General Assembly established VORP in 1993 
to provide funding support for the state’s earliest non-profit media-
tion centers. The second is the Parent Education and Mediation Fund 
(PEMF) established pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 38 and T.C.A. 
§6-6-413. The third is the Access & Visitation Grant which is available for the develop-
ment or continuation of  initiatives that will address the needs of  never-married, self-represented litigants and focus on services to help them resolve any or 
all issues concerning parenting and visitation in child support cases or cases involving child support issues. The AOC distributes these funds to grantees to 
provide education and mediation for indigent parents involved in absolute divorce, legal separation, annulment, or separate maintenance proceedings, and 
any other custody matters.

Mediation Centers & Rule 31 

Several Mediation Providers reported specific initiatives:

•  Mid South Mediation Services reported participating in adult and juvenile victim offender mediations and some civil 

mediation in court. Mid-South Mediation noted that nearly all of  their cases have positive comments of  satisfaction on 
the mediation feedbacks.

•  First Judicial District Court Clinic (“Court Clinic”) reported that the court mediation partnership program refers 

litigants for either mediation or supervised visitation. The program has been successful in reuniting fathers/mothers 
with their children via parenting plans and our supervised visitation program.

•  Mid-South Community Justice & Mediation Center, Inc reported offering free mediations each Thursday in Shelby 

County General Sessions Court as well as free and reduced-cost, income-based mediations by appointment only. The 
program also reported a free restorative practice reentry program and low-cost restorative practice circle training 
offered to schools located in Shelby County. In 2018, the provider obtained 501(c)(3) recognition from the IRS and 
expanded our services to provide free and reduced cost mediations to the public. In September 2018, the program 
became a recognized United Way of  Greater Memphis’ Driving the Dream (DTD) referral network and began offering 
free mediation services to persons with income at or below the poverty level.

•  Kindred Place reported that the program is primarily referred mediations for custody and visitation from Juvenile 

Court. Kindred Place offers a sliding fee scale for these services with the lowest fee being $25 per party. Th provider 
reported that its greatest success is helping families find visitation plans that allowed both parents to have a 
relationship with the children.

•  VORP/Community Mediation Center reported providing free mediation in General Sessions,  Civil and Juvenile  

court as well as community referrals. The program serves rural areas and low income Tennesseans.  Our service is 
tremendous to those in need, and allows court resources to focus on more severe cases. If  the program cannot help 
them we try and refer to other resources. Notably, in 2018, the program grew by adding juvenile cases in Overton 
County.

Tennessee Supreme CourtAccess to Justice CommissionPro Bono Recognition

In an effort to increase the number of  attorneys and law offices providing pro bono services to those who cannot afford 

legal costs, the Tennessee Supreme Court has an extensive recognition program. The Court honors all attorneys providing 
at least 50 hours of  service annually, with a goal of  increasing statewide pro bono work to 50 percent participation. In the 

program, attorneys meeting the Court’s minimum 
goal of  50 pro bono hours annually are named 
“Attorneys for Justice” by the Tennessee Supreme 
Court. The program is entirely voluntary 
and based on self-reporting. The Court also 
recognizes Law Students for Justice.

In 2018, the Supreme Court 
recognized 717 attorneys as 
Attorneys for Justice, up from 
522 in 2017.

• 

In 2018, the Supreme Court recognized 
717 attorneys as Attorneys for Justice. Each 
attorney provided 50 or more hours of  pro 
bono service in the 2017 calendar year. This number increased from 522 Attorneys for Justice recognized in 2017, an 
increase of  nearly half  of  the 2017 figure.  

•  The attorneys who were recognized reported a total of  104,645 hours of  pro bono service.

• 

Sixty-seven attorneys each reported providing 300 hours or more hours of  pro bono service in the prior year.

•  One law firm, Dodson, Parker, Behm, & Capparella, PC submitted an application for recognition directly to the AOC and 
was recognized as a Law Firm for Justice for pro bono work done by their attorneys. This office provided an average of  
50 or more hours per attorney during the 2018 calendar year.

• 

In 2018, 158 Law Students for Justice were recognized for performing 50 or more hours of  pro bono legal work over the 
course of  their law school careers.

Conclusion

The Tennessee Supreme Court ATJ Commission is proud to highlight the extensive pro bono efforts of  organizations, 

attorneys, and law students in this annual report. Thanks to the generosity of  so many, Access to Justice has become 
a reality for many disadvantaged Tennesseans and ATJC thanks its partners across their state for their participation in 

this annual survey and report. 

In conclusion, this report reveals that, in 2018, more Tennessee attorneys participated in Pro Bono than ever before, with 
more than 52% of  Tennessee Attorneys and more than 51% of  All Attorneys reporting pro bono participation. The impact 
of  that work is reflected each day through every county in Tennessee, and examples of  the ways that different partners across 
the state, from Law Firms to Legal Providers to Bar Associations and more, provide that Pro Bono is illustrated through both 
data and narrative throughout this report.

The ATJ Commission urges attorneys to continue to track and report the many activities in which they have provided pro 
bono representation or services per Supreme Court Rule 8, Section 6.1.
