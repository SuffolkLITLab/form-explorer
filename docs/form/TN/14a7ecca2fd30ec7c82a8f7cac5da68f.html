Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed and 
Remanded.

ARNOLD B. GOLDIN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ANDY D. BENNETT 
and KRISTI M. DAVIS, JJ., joined.

Jonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter, and Carrie Perras, Assistant Attorney 
General, for the appellee, Tennessee Department of Children’s Services.

BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

OPINION

Removal of Child

Kathleen T. (“Mother”) is the mother of one minor child, Braylin T. (“Child”), born 
in July 2014.1  On June 4, 2019, the Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”) received 
a referral with allegations of a drug-exposed child.  During the course of its investigation, 
DCS discovered that Mother and Child had been residing with the maternal grandmother, 
Theresa  T.  (“Maternal  Grandmother”),  and  the  step-grandfather,  Jerry  C.  (“Step-
Grandfather”).    Maternal  Grandmother  and  Step-Grandfather  previously  had  a  child 
                                           

1 This Court has a policy of protecting children’s identities in parental termination cases, and we 

therefore initialize the surnames of certain persons mentioned in this Opinion.

03/21/2023removed from their home due to methamphetamine use and had not yet regained custody 
of that child.  It was further discovered that the same child had been sexually abused by 
another individual who had lived in the home.  At the time of the June 2019 referral, there 
were  several  individuals  living  in  the  home  in  addition  to  Mother,  Child,  Maternal 
Grandmother, and Step-Grandfather.  DCS informed Mother that she and Child could not 
continue  living  with  Maternal  Grandmother due  to  safety  concerns,  which  included 
substance  abuse,  bedbug  and  roach  infestations,  and  the  high  number  of  individuals 
residing in the home.  Mother and Child then moved in with Mother’s father. 

On  September  4,  2019,  DCS  received  another  referral  concerning  the  fact  that 
Mother  and  Child  had  returned  to  live  with  Maternal  Grandmother.    Upon  further 
investigation,  DCS  noted  unsanitary  conditions,  including  an  infestation  of  roaches  and 
bedbugs, holes in the wall, a toilet in the living room, and, again, multiple people living in 
the  home.    The  individual  who  had  allegedly  previously  sexually  abused  a  child  in  the 
home was also discovered to once again be living there.  Mother tested negative for drugs; 
however, Maternal Grandmother admitted to using methamphetamine just two days prior.  
Mother also informed DCS that there was another individual living upstairs that was using 
methamphetamine and had been “causing all the problems.”  After a discussion with DCS, 
Mother agreed that Melissa H., could take custody.2  However, shortly thereafter, Mother 
took Child back to Maternal Grandmother’s home and refused to let him return to the home 
of Melissa H.  A child and family team meeting was scheduled for Tuesday, September 10, 
2019, but Mother refused to attend despite DCS providing transportation.  

On  September  13,  2019,  DCS  filed  a  petition  to  declare  Child  dependent  and 
neglected and asked for emergency temporary custody.  That same day, the Juvenile Court 
of  Dekalb  County,  Tennessee, issued  an  order  finding  that  there  was  probable  cause  to 
believe that Child was dependent and neglected and awarded DCS custody.  

The Permanency Plans

DCS  created  four  separate  permanency  plans  outlining  the  requirements  Mother 
needed  to  follow  to  regain  custody  of  Child.    The  juvenile  court  ratified  each  of  these 
permanency  plans.    The  first  plan  was  developed  on  October  7,  2019.    Mother’s 
responsibilities under this plan were as follows: submit to a psychological assessment with 
a  clinical  parenting  component  and  complete  all  recommendations;  submit  a  working 
budget to DCS; contact her DCS case manager weekly; obtain and maintain safe and stable 
housing; obtain and maintain a legal  means of income; submit to random hair and urine 
drug screens and be able to test negative; refrain from allowing individuals with a criminal 
record to live with her; visit Child at least twice a month and provide healthy snacks and 
drinks for the visitation.  

                                           

2 Pursuant to DCS’s appellate brief, Melissa H. is referred to as Child’s “other grandmother.”

- 2 -

A  second  permanency  plan  was  created  on  March  27,  2020.    Mother’s 
responsibilities  remained  largely  the  same  as  the  first  plan,  with  the  addition  of  the 
following responsibilities: sign releases of information for all of the psychiatric hospitals 
she  has  received  care  from  since  Child  has  been  in  DCS  custody;  sign  releases  for  her 
current  service  providers;  allow  DCS  to  make  both  announced  and  unannounced  home 
visits to assess safety; remedy her criminal charges; and refrain from participating in further 
criminal activity.  

The third permanency plan was created on July 24, 2020, and contained the same 
responsibilities  of  the  previous  two  plans.    The  fourth  and  final  permanency  plan  was 
created  on  November  8,  2021.    This  plan  again  contained  the  same  responsibilities  as 
previous plans, with the addition of the requirement that Mother will provide proof that she 
is consistently participating and cooperating with her mental health providers.  

Mother's Criminal Behavior

Mother 

incurred  multiple  criminal  charges  during 

the  custodial  episode.  
Specifically,  she  was  arrested  a  total  of  five  times,  and  her  charges  included  criminal 
trespass,  failure  to  appear,  theft  of  property  pertaining  to  shoplifting,  and  retaliation  for 
past  action.    Mother  was  incarcerated  on  the  following  dates:  December  16-17,  2019; 
January 10-11, 2020; January 29-30, 2020; August 26, 2020; and June 9, 2020 – October 
28, 2020.  

Petition for Termination of Mother’s Parental Rights

On  October  19,  2020,  DCS  filed  a  “Petition  for  Termination  of  Parental  Rights” 
(“Petition”) regarding Mother.  Pursuant to its Petition, DCS set forth numerous grounds 
that allegedly warranted termination of Mother’s parental rights, namely: abandonment by 
an incarcerated parent for failure to support;  abandonment by an incarcerated parent for 
failure to visit; abandonment by wanton disregard; abandonment by failure to establish a 
suitable  home;  substantial  noncompliance  with  the  permanency  plans;  persistent 
conditions; and a failure to manifest an ability and willingness to assume custody of Child.  
DCS  further  asserted  that  termination  of  Mother’s  parental  rights  was  in  Child’s  best 
interest.  Trial on the termination case occurred on May 19, 2022.  On August 9, 2022, the 
trial  court  entered  an  order  terminating  Mother’s  parental  rights.    Specifically,  it 
determined  that  DCS  had  proven,  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence,  each  of  the  above-
enumerated grounds for termination.  The trial court further determined that termination of 
Mother’s parental rights was in Child’s best interest.  This appeal followed. 

ISSUES ON APPEAL

Mother raises a single issue on appeal for our review, restated as follows: Whether 
the  trial  court  erred  in  finding  that  the  termination  of  Mother’s  parental  rights  was  in 
- 3 -

Child’s best interest.  Notwithstanding the fact that Mother only presents a single issue for 
our review, precedent from the Tennessee Supreme Court necessitates that we conduct a 
more thorough examination of this case.  Indeed, pursuant to the direction included in the 
opinion in In re Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d 507 (Tenn. 2016), “in an appeal from an order 
terminating parental rights the Court of Appeals must review the trial court’s findings as 
to each ground for termination and as to whether termination is in the child’s best interests, 
regardless of whether the parent challenges these findings on appeal.”  Id. at 525-26.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

“A  parent’s  right  to  the  care  and  custody  of  her  child  is  among  the  oldest  of  the 
judicially recognized fundamental liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clauses 
of the federal and state constitutions.” Id. at 521 (citing Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 
65  (2000);  In  re  Angela  E.,  303  S.W.3d  240, 250  (Tenn.  2010)).    Although  this  right  is 
considered to be both fundamental and constitutionally protected, it is not absolute. In re 
J.C.D.,  254  S.W.3d  432,  437  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2007).    This  right  “continues  without 
interruption only as long as a parent has not relinquished it, abandoned it, or engaged in 
conduct requiring its limitation or termination.” In re M.J.B., 140 S.W.3d 643, 653 (Tenn. 
Ct. App. 2004).  “[T]he state as parens patriae has a special duty to protect minors,” Hawk 
v. Hawk, 855 S.W.2d 573, 580 (Tenn. 1993) (quoting Matter of Hamilton, 657 S.W.2d 425, 
429 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983)), and “Tennessee law . . . thus . . . upholds the state’s authority 
as parens patriae when interference with parenting is necessary to prevent serious harm to 
a child.” Id. 

Under Tennessee law there exist “[w]ell-defined circumstances . . . under which a 
parent’s rights may be terminated.” In re Roger T., No. W2014-02184-COA-R3-PT, 2015 
WL 1897696, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2015).  These circumstances are statutorily 
defined.  Id.  (citing  In  re  Audrey  S.,  182  S.W.3d  838,  860  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2005)).    “To 
terminate parental rights, a court must determine that clear and convincing evidence proves 
not only that statutory grounds exist but also that termination is in the child’s best interest.” 
In re Valentine, 79 S.W.3d 539, 546 (Tenn. 2002) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(c)).  
“‘Clear and convincing evidence’ is ‘evidence in which there is no serious or substantial 
doubt  about  the  correctness  of  the  conclusions  drawn  from  the  evidence.’”  Id.  (quoting 
Hodges  v.  S.C.  Toof  &  Co.,  833  S.W.2d  896,  901  n.3  (Tenn.  1992)).    This  heightened 
burden  of  proof  “minimizes  the  risk  of  erroneous  decisions.”  In  re  M.L.P.,  228  S.W.3d 
139, 143 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007). 

Due to this heightened burden of proof, we must adapt our customary standard of 

review: 

First, we must review the trial court’s specific findings of fact de novo 
in accordance with Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d).  Thus, each of the trial court’s 
specific factual findings will be presumed to be correct unless the evidence 
- 4 -

preponderates  otherwise.    Second,  we  must  determine  whether  the  facts, 
either as found by the trial court or as supported by the preponderance of the 
evidence,  clearly  and  convincingly  establish  the  elements  required  to 
terminate a biological parent’s parental rights. 

In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 861. 

DISCUSSION

Before we address the merits of Mother’s appeal, we find it appropriate to discuss 
the considerable briefing issues contained within Mother’s appellate brief.  Specifically, 
we  note  that  Mother’s  actual  argument  is  limited  to  a  single  sentence  subsequent  to  her 
presentment  of  the  relevant  best  interest  factors  to  be  analyzed.    Her  sole  sentence  of 
argument, which incidentally is not supported by any specific citation to the record, states 
that, “[a]lthough limited by long-term mental health struggles, [Mother] made attempts to 
comply with her permanency plan so she could raise her child.”  The entire rest of the brief 
is  nothing  more  than  a  recitation  of  the  facts  of  the  underlying  matter  and  the  relevant 
standard of review.  In reviewing Mother’s brief, we find that it is not in compliance with 
Rule  27(a)  of  the  Tennessee  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure,  which  requires  that  an 
appellant’s brief must include the following, in pertinent part: 

(7) An argument, which may be preceded by a summary of argument, setting 
forth: 

(A)  the  contentions  of  the  appellant  with  respect  to  the  issues 
presented,  and  the  reasons  therefor,  including  the  reasons  why  the 
contentions  require  appellate  relief,  with  citations  to  the  authorities 
and  appropriate  references  to  the  record (which  may  be  quoted 
verbatim) relied on; and 
(B) for each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of 
review  (which  may  appear  in  the  discussion of  the  issue  or  under  a 
separate heading placed before the discussion of the issues)[.] 

Tenn. R.  App.  P.  27(a).    In  In  re  Yariel  S.,  No.  E2016-00937-COA-R3-PT,  2017  WL 
65469, at *5–6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 6, 2017), we cautioned against attorneys who offer 
little argument in support of a client’s position, there specifically in relation to an attorney 
who  relied  upon  this  Court’s  duty  to  perform  a  comprehensive  review  under  In  re 
Carrington H.: 

Mother’s  counsel  offers  little  argument  in  support  of  Mother’s  request  for 
reversal of the statutory grounds supporting the termination.  Instead, counsel 
cites  our  Supreme  Court’s  holding  in  Carrington[.]  . .  . We  agree  that  our 
review of each ground and the best interest decision is required; however, we 
- 5 -

caution  counsel  against  the  use  of  our  Supreme  Court’s  holding  in  this 
manner. See generally Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 8(3) (providing that lawyers 
are obligated to act as a zealous advocate on behalf of his or her client). 

Id.  In accordance with our Supreme Court’s opinion in In re Carrington H., we soldier on 
in our review.  However, as we stated in our opinion in In re Yariel S., we caution counsel 
against  forgoing  the  requirements  of  Rule  27  on  the  basis  that  this  Court  is  required  to 
review  the  grounds  for  termination  and  the  best  interest  analysis.    See  In  re  K.W.,  No. 
M2021-00408-COA-R3-PT,  2021  WL  5783355,  at  *8-9  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  Dec.  7,  2021) 
(discussing  the  warning  of  caution  provided  in  In  re  Yariel  S. and  noting  how  zealous 
advocacy is required).  Again, we emphasize counsel’s obligation to zealously represent 
their clients. Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 8(3). Because waiver is not available in this matter 
despite Mother’s de minimis brief, we will proceed to analyze whether or not there is clear 
and  convincing  evidence  to  support  both  the  grounds  for  termination  and  whether  the 
termination is in Child’s best interest.  

Grounds for Termination

Although Mother does not challenge the trial court’s findings on any of the grounds 
for termination of her parental rights, this Court will address each ground found by the trial 
court  pursuant  to  the  direction  of  our  Supreme  Court,  as  indicated  earlier.  See  In  re 
Carrington H., 483 S.W.3d at 525-26.

Abandonment by an Incarcerated Parent

A ground for termination exists based on a parent’s abandonment of his or her child. 
Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-113(g)(1).    As  it  relates  to  this  termination  proceeding, 
abandonment by an incarcerated parent was defined as:3

A parent or guardian is incarcerated at the time of the filing of a proceeding, 
pleading, petition, or amended petition to terminate the parental rights of the 
parent  or  guardian  of  the  child  who  is  the  subject  of  the  petition  for 
termination of parental rights or adoption, or a parent or guardian has been 
incarcerated  during  all  or  part  of  the  four  (4)  consecutive months 
immediately preceding the filing of the action and has: 

(a) Failed  to  visit,  has  failed  to  support,  or  has  failed  to  make  reasonable 
payments  toward  the  support  of  the  child  for  four  (4)  consecutive  months 
immediately preceding the parent’s or guardian’s incarceration; 

. . . .

                                           

3 The statute has since been amended.

- 6 -

(c) Has  engaged  in  conduct  prior  to  incarceration  that  exhibits  a  wanton 

disregard for the welfare of the child[.] 

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(A)(iv) (Supp. 2020).  In its order, the trial court determined 
that all three grounds under this portion of the statute—failure to visit, failure to support, 
and wanton disregard—applied to Mother.  The termination petition was filed on October 
19, 2020.  Mother was incarcerated beginning on June 9, 2020, through October 28, 2020.  
As  such,  Mother  was  incarcerated  during  the  entirety  of  the  four  months  immediately 
preceding the filing of the termination petition.  Therefore, the relevant four-month period 
for  our  analysis  is  the  four  months  immediately  preceding  Mother’s  incarceration as  it 
relates to the failure to visit and failure to support grounds.  As discussed below, however, 
our focus is not restricted to that period as it relates to the wanton disregard ground.

Failure to Visit

The  failure  to  visit  is  statutorily  defined  as  “the  failure,  for  a  period  of  four  (4) 
consecutive months, to visit or engage in more than token visitation.  That the parent had 
only the means or ability to make very occasional visits is not a defense to failure to visit 
if no visits were made during the relevant four-month period.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-
102(1)(E).    “Token  visitation”  is  defined  as  “visitation,  under  the  circumstances  of  the 
individual case, [which] constitutes nothing more than perfunctory visitation or visitation 
of such an infrequent nature or of such short duration as to merely establish  minimal or 
insubstantial contact with the child.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(C). 

According  to  the  record  on  appeal,  Mother  did  not  visit  Child  at  all  during  the 
relevant four-month period.  In fact, Mother’s last visit with Child was October 10, 2019.  
We note that Mother was eligible for two visits per month, to last no less than two hours 
per visit.  Mother did schedule visits with Child, but she would later cancel those visits.  
Mother  was  also  aware  of  her  duty  to  visit  Child  as  it  was  expressly  set  out  in  the 
permanency plans, and she was made aware that her failure to visit may constitute a ground 
for termination of her parental rights.  Mother admitted during discovery that she failed to 
visit Child because she was “not in a good place emotionally.”  The trial court found that 
Mother did not provide sufficient proof as to any excuse for her failure to visit as she was 
not incarcerated or hospitalized during the relevant period and there was a clear duty to 
visit.    Moreover,  the  trial  court  noted  that  “visitation  preserves  the  thread  of  the 
relationship,” and Mother did not have any visitation with Child.  Based on our review of 
the record, we agree with the trial court and conclude that there is clear and convincing 
evidence that Mother abandoned Child by failing to visit him during the four-month period 
immediately preceding her incarceration.4

                                           

4 We also  note that Mother did  not raise the affirmative  defense  of  lack  of willfulness as to the 

ground of failure to visit. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(I). 

- 7 -

Failure to Support

The failure to support is defined as “the failure, for a period of four (4) consecutive 
months, to provide monetary support or the failure to provide more than token payments 
toward  the  support  of  the  child.    That  the  parent  had  only  the  means  or  ability  to  make 
small payments is not a defense to failure to support if no payments were made during the 
relevant four-month period.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(D) (emphasis added).  Token 
support  “means  that  the  support,  under  the  circumstances  of  the  individual  case,  is 
insignificant given the parent’s means.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-102(1)(B).  

The record shows that, during the relevant four-month period, Mother did not pay 
any voluntary support for Child.5  The trial court had ordered Mother to pay $259.00 per 
month of child support beginning on October 31, 2019.  The permanency plans included 
Mother’s responsibility to pay this support, and Mother was aware of this responsibility.  
Moreover, as with the failure to visit, Mother had acknowledged that the failure to support 
may constitute a ground for termination of her parental rights.  Based on our review of the 
record,  Mother  was  able-bodied  and  capable  of  working  to  support  Child,  as  she  had  a 
somewhat  extensive  work  history  and  her  medical  records  from  2020  indicated  that  she 
had  an  ability  to  work.    In  light  of  the  foregoing,  we  conclude  that  there  was  clear  and 
convincing evidence that Mother abandoned Child by failing to support Child during the 
four-month period immediately preceding her incarceration.6

Wanton Disregard

Although  not  expressly  defined  by  the  statute,  we  note  that  wanton  disregard  is 
recognized “in much the same way as Justice Potter Stewart identified pornography: ‘[we] 
know it when [we] see it.’” In re Anthony R., No. M2014-01753-COA-R3-PT, 2015 WL 
3611244, *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2015) (quoting Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 378 U.S. 
184,  197  (1964)). “Tennessee  courts  have  held  that  ‘probation  violations,  repeated 
incarceration,  criminal  behavior,  substance  abuse,  and  the  failure  to provide  adequate 
support  or  supervision  for  a  child  can  alone  or  in  combination,  constitute  conduct  that 
exhibits a wanton disregard for the child.’” Id. (citing In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 867–
68).  Parental conduct which exhibits a wanton disregard for a child’s welfare is not limited 
to the four-month period immediately preceding incarceration and may occur at any time 
prior to incarceration.  Id. (citing In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 871).  Incarceration alone 
does  not  warrant  a  determination  that  a  parent  has  engaged  in  conduct  that  exhibits  a 

                                           

5 The record shows that DCS intercepted a stimulus check in May 2020 for Mother that amounted 
to $1,036.00.  However, this does not constitute a payment of support by Mother. See In re Ima D., No. 
M2021-00022-COA-R3-PT, 2021 WL 5441832, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2021) (“We note, however, 
that such intercepted payments are typically not considered when determining whether a parent has failed 
to support his children.”). 

6 Similar  to  the  charge  of  failure  to  visit,  Mother  also  did  not  raise  the  defense  of  a  lack  of 

willfulness as to the ground of failure to support.

wanton disregard, In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 866, but rather, a court must find “by 
clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  parent’s  pre-incarceration  conduct  displayed  a 
wanton  disregard  for  the  welfare  of  the  child.”  Id.  “[T]he  parent’s  incarceration  serves 
only  as  a  triggering  mechanism  that  allows  the  court  to  take  a  closer  look  at  the  child’s 
situation to determine whether the parental behavior that resulted in incarceration is part of 
a broader pattern of conduct that renders the parent unfit or poses a risk of substantial harm 
to the welfare of the child.” Id. 

In this case, Mother was arrested and charged with criminal trespass in December 
2019.  Mother failed to appear, and three separate bench warrants were thereafter issued 
related to this charge.  In March 2020, Mother was charged with theft of property involving 
merchandise  for  allegedly  shoplifting  from  Wal-Mart.  During  the  custodial  episode, 
Mother was incarcerated multiple times.  Mother’s most recent arrest for purposes of this 
case, in June 2020, was for retaliation for past action when DCS attempted to perform a 
home  visit  with  Mother’s  attorney  and  law  enforcement  present.    During  this  incident, 
Mother threatened to “put a bullet between their eyes,” referring to the individuals present 
as  well  as  the  juvenile  court  judge.    In  addition  to  her  criminal  issues  and  multiple 
incarcerations, DCS notes an incident where Child had significant dental issues and tooth 
pain and was in need of dental surgery, yet Mother refused to consent to the surgery.  This 
resulted in DCS being forced to obtain a court order to approve the surgery. 

Moreover,  we  highlight  the  concerns  raised  by  the  trial  court  that,  despite  being 
warned by DCS to not return to Maternal Grandmother’s home, where there was ongoing 
drug use and had previously been sexual abuse of another child occurring, Mother returned 
with  Child  to  the  home.  In  light  of  the  foregoing,  we  conclude  that  there  is  clear  and 
convincing evidence to support the ground that Mother exhibited a wanton disregard for 
Child’s welfare.

Abandonment by Failure to Establish a Suitable Home

In  addition  to  the  forms  of  abandonment  espoused  above,  Tennessee  Code 

Annotated section 36-1-102(1)(A)(ii) also provides that abandonment occurs when:

(a) The  child  has  been  removed  from  the  home  or  the  physical  or  legal 
custody of a parent or parents or guardian or guardians by a court order 
at  any  stage  of  proceedings  in  which  a  petition  has  been  filed  in  the 
juvenile court alleging that a child is a dependent and neglected child, and 
the child was placed in the custody of the department or a licensed child-
placing agency; 

(b) The juvenile court found, or the court where the termination of parental 
rights  petition  is  filed  finds,  that  the  department  or  a  licensed  child-
placing agency made reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the child 

- 9 -

or  that  the  circumstances  of  the  child’s  situation  prevented  reasonable 
efforts from being made prior to the child’s removal; and 

(c) For  a  period  of  four  (4)  months  following  the  physical  removal,  the 
department  or  agency  made  reasonable  efforts  to  assist  the  parent  or 
parents or the guardian or guardians to establish a suitable home for the 
child, but that the parent or parents or the guardian or guardians have not 
made reciprocal reasonable efforts to provide a suitable home and have 
demonstrated  a  lack  of  concern  for  the  child  to  such  a  degree  that  it 
appears unlikely that they will be able to provide a suitable home for the 
child at an early date.  The efforts of the department or agency to assist a 
parent or guardian in establishing a suitable home for the child shall be 
found to be reasonable if such efforts equal or exceed the efforts of the 
parent or guardian toward the same goal, when the parent or guardian is 
aware that the child is in the custody of the department. 

Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-102(1)(A)(ii).    “A  suitable  home  ‘requires  more  than  a  proper 
physical living location.’” In re Navada N., 498 S.W.3d 579, 595 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2016) 
(quoting  In  re  Hannah  H.,  No.  E2013-01211-COA-R3-PT,  2014  WL  2587397,  at  *9 
(Tenn.  Ct.  App.  June  10,  2014)).    “It  also  requires  that  the  home  be  free  of  drugs  and 
domestic violence.” Id. (quoting In re Hannah H., 2014 WL 2587397, at *9).  

As  noted  above,  section  36-1-102(1)(A)(ii)  provides  that  when  the  ground  of 
abandonment by failure to provide a suitable home is raised, DCS must “[f]or a period of 
four (4) months following the physical removal” make reasonable efforts in assisting the 
parent or parents with establishing a suitable home for the child.  Here, Child was removed 
on  September  13,  2019,  pursuant  to  a  protective  order.   In  its  final  order,  the  trial  court 
determined that the relevant four-month period for purposes of this ground was September 
14,  2019  to  January  14, 2020.    First,  we  note  our  agreement  with  the  trial  court’s 
determination that DCS made reasonable efforts during this period7 to assist Mother with 
establishing a suitable home for Child.  The record indicates that DCS held multiple child 
and  family  team  meetings  to  explain  to  Mother  her  responsibilities  and  the  criteria  for 
termination.    DCS  also  offered  and  provided  transportation  to  Mother,  attempted  to 
perform  home  visits,  scheduled  appointments  with  providers,  and  even  created  a  list  of 
service providers for Mother.  Moreover, DCS provided Mother with food when she said 
she was hungry, offered visitation with Child, provided a list of housing and employment 
options,  and  offered  to  drive  Mother  to  Child’s  dental  surgery,  among  multiple  other 
efforts.  In its order, the trial court found that DCS’s efforts were “fairly extraordinary.”  
We agree and conclude that DCS did in fact make reasonable efforts to assist Mother with 
                                           

7 This was an appropriate four-month period to focus on, although we observe that "[a]ccording to 
an ordinary reading of the statute . . . the proof necessary to support termination under this ground need not 
be limited to any particular four-month period after removal." In re Jakob O., No. M2016-00391-COA-R3-
PT, 2016 WL 7243674, at *13 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2016).

establishing a suitable home for Child.  However, we do not find that Mother has made the 
requisite reciprocal efforts necessary in establishing a suitable home, but rather Mother has 
“demonstrated a lack of concern for [Child] to such a degree that it appears unlikely” that 
she  can  provide  a  suitable  home  for  Child  at  an  early  date. Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-
102(1)(A)(ii). Mother did not maintain stable housing and instead remained living with 
Maternal Grandmother, despite DCS’s previous warnings.  Maternal Grandmother’s home 
was rife with drug-use and unsanitary conditions.  As noted by DCS in its brief, Mother 
has had years to establish a suitable home in order to have Child returned, but has failed to 
do so.  

In light of the foregoing, we conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence in 

the record to find that Mother has failed to establish a suitable home for Child. 

Substantial Noncompliance with the Permanency Plan

The trial court also terminated Mother’s parental rights on the ground of substantial 
noncompliance  with  the  permanency  plan.    Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  36-1-
113(g)(2) provides that termination of a party’s parental rights may be predicated upon a 
“substantial noncompliance by the parent or guardian with the statement of responsibilities 
in a permanency plan.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(g)(2).  “Trivial, minor, or technical 
deviations  from  a  permanency  plan’s  requirements  will  not  be  deemed  to  be  substantial 
noncompliance.” In re M.J.B., 140 S.W.3d 643, 656 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004) (citing In re 
Valentine, 79 S.W.3d at 548; Dep’t of Children’s Servs. v. C.L., No. M2001-0279-COA-
R3-JV, 2003 WL 22037399, at *18 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2003)).  

In this case, there were four separate permanency plans developed in the underlying 
dependency and neglect matter.  These plans were ratified by the juvenile court and found 
to be reasonable, necessary, and in Child’s best interest.  As we noted earlier, these plans 
set forth numerous responsibilities and tasks for Mother to complete, including: submit to 
a  psychological  assessment  with  a  clinical  parenting  component  and  complete  all 
recommendations;  submit  a  working  budget  to  DCS;  contact  her  DCS  case  manager 
weekly; obtain and maintain safe and stable housing; obtain and maintain a legal means of 
income; submit to random hair and urine drug screens and be able to test negative; refrain 
from allowing individuals with a criminal record to live with her; visit Child at least twice 
a  month  and  provide  healthy  snacks  and  drinks  for  the  visitation;  sign  releases  of 
information for all of the psychiatric hospitals she has received care from since Child has 
been in DCS custody; sign releases for her current service providers; allow DCS to make 
both  announced  and  unannounced  home  visits  to  assess  safety;  remedy  her  criminal 
charges;  and  refrain  from  participating  in  criminal  activity.    Of  all  the  responsibilities 
required of her, Mother completed a mental health evaluation in May 2021 after the petition 
to terminate her parental rights had been filed; maintained stable housing in the form of her 
own  apartment  for  about  sixty  days  in  March  2021;  and  was  employed  for  about  four 
months.  This Court has previously held that a parent’s compliance with a permanency plan 
- 11 -

after a petition to terminate parental rights has been filed can be “too little, too late.” In re 
A.W.,  114  S.W.3d  541,  546  (Tenn.  Ct.  App.  2003).    Although  Mother  attempted  to 
complete a few of her requirements, she was otherwise substantially noncompliant with the 
permanency plans, and there is no evidence of any effort by Mother to comply with her 
responsibilities as a whole.  Moreover, the limited actions Mother did take in an attempt to 
comply  with  the  permanency  plans  occurred  in  2021,  months  after  DCS’s  Petition  was 
filed.   

Based on our review of the evidence in this record, we conclude that there is clear 
and convincing evidence to support a finding that Mother was in substantial noncompliance 
with the permanency plans. 

Persistence of Conditions

The trial court also terminated Mother’s parental rights on the  ground commonly 

known as “persistent conditions.”  This ground applies when: 

(3)(A) The child has been removed from the home or the physical or 
legal custody of a parent or guardian for a period of six (6) months by a court 
order  entered  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings in  which  a  petition  has  been 
filed in the juvenile court alleging that a child is a dependent and neglected 
child, and: 

(i)  The  conditions  that  led  to  the  child’s  removal  still  persist, 
preventing the child’s safe return to the care of the parent or guardian, 
or  other  conditions  exist  that,  in  all  reasonable  probability,  would 
cause the child to be subjected to further abuse or neglect, preventing 
the child’s safe return to the care of the parent or guardian; 
(ii) There is little likelihood that these conditions will be remedied at 
an early date so that the child can be safely returned to the parent or 
guardian in the near future; and
(iii) The continuation of the parent or guardian and child relationship 
greatly diminishes the child’s chances of early integration into a safe, 
stable, and permanent home.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(g)(3).  

Here, Child was removed from Mother’s custody pursuant to a court order entered 
on September 13, 2019, based on DCS’s previously-filed dependency and neglect petition, 
which ultimately resulted in a finding of dependency and neglect.  The termination hearing 
occurred on May 19, 2022, which was more than six months since Child’s removal.  Upon 
reviewing  the  record,  we  conclude  that  the  evidence  contained  therein  satisfies  this 
statutory  ground  for  termination.    As  alluded  to  elsewhere  in  this  Opinion,  Mother  has 
- 12 -

failed  to  remedy  the  conditions  that  led  to  Child’s  removal.    Child  was  removed  from 
Mother’s care based on dangerous living conditions, which still persist as Mother lived at 
the same home from which Child was removed at the time of the hearing.  Mother’s mental 
health  condition  still  persists,  and  she  has  been  inconsistent  with  attending  her  mental 
health  appointments  and  taking  her  medication.    In  addition  to  these  conditions  still 
persisting, there is also little likelihood that they will be remedied at an early date such as 
to warrant Child’s safe return.  It has been nearly three years since Child’s removal, and 
yet Mother has still not remedied the conditions that led to the removal and there is little to 
no indication of any progress she has made.  Finally, the continuation of the parent-child 
relationship between Mother and Child greatly diminishes Child’s chances of integration 
into a safe, stable, and permanent home.  The record shows that Child has been doing well 
in  his  foster  home  and  is  receiving  appropriate  medical  care and  participating  in  extra-
curricular activities.  Moreover, Child has bonded with his foster family who has expressed 
a willingness to adopt him. 

In light of the foregoing, we conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence 
that the ground of persistent conditions has been proven and is an appropriate ground for 
termination. 

Failure to Manifest an Ability & Willingness to Assume Custody

The trial court also terminated Mother’s parental rights on the ground that she failed 
to manifest an ability and willingness to care for Child.  Tennessee Code Annotated section 
36-1-113(g)(14) provides a ground for termination when:

A parent or guardian has failed to manifest, by act or omission, an ability and 
willingness  to  personally  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  or  financial 
responsibility  of  the  child,  and  placing  the  child  in  the  person’s  legal  and 
physical  custody  would  pose  a  risk  of  substantial  harm  to  the  physical  or 
psychological welfare of the child.

Tenn.  Code  Ann.  §  36-1-113(g)(14).    As  is  evident,  and  as  discussed  by  case  law,  this 
statute is two-pronged.  See In re Neveah M., 614 S.W.3d 659, 674 (Tenn. 2020). As to the 
first prong, the trial court determined that Mother had “failed to manifest a willingness and 
ability  to  assume  custody.”    The  trial  court  specifically  noted  Mother’s  ongoing  mental 
health  issues  which  are  such  that  she  cannot  presently  care  for  herself.    The  trial  court 
further noted that Mother has not completed the requirements set forth in the permanency 
plans and that unsafe living conditions persisted.  Mother had also failed to pay any child 
support towards Child.  Ultimately, the trial court determined that Mother has not shown 
that  she  is  capable  of  assuming  legal  or  physical  custody  or  financial  responsibility  of 
Child.  We agree with the trial court’s findings.  As noted previously, Mother has made 
almost no progress in remedying any of the issues leading to Child’s removal, and this is 
reflective of her failure to exhibit an ability or willingness to assume any form of custody 
- 13 -

of Child.  

As to the second prong, the trial court determined that placing Child into Mother’s 
legal  and  physical  custody  would  pose  a  risk  of  substantial  harm  to  his  physical  and
psychological  welfare.    Specifically,  the  trial  court  noted  that  Child  is  bonded  with  the 
foster family and is enjoying a safe and secure home.  Moreover, the trial court found that 
a change of custody for Child would be detrimental to him.  We again agree with the trial 
court’s  determination  in  this  regard.    While  in  Mother’s  care  Child  was  consistently 
exposed  to  an  unsafe  environment  and  was  not  receiving  proper  care,  whereas  Child  is 
thriving  in  his  foster  home  and  is  now  living  in  a  stable  environment,  contrary  to  his 
previous living conditions. 

In  light  of  the  foregoing,  we  conclude  that  the  trial  court’s  finding  of  a  ground 
pursuant to section 36-1-113(g)(14) has been satisfied by clear and convincing evidence, 
and we affirm the trial court’s order on this ground. 

Best Interests

Once it is determined that a ground exists for terminating a party’s parental rights, 
the focus then shifts to whether termination is in the child’s best interest. In re Audrey S., 
182  S.W.3d  at  877.    Tennessee  Code  Annotated  section  36-1-113(i)  provides  a non-
exhaustive list of factors for the courts to consider in their best interest analysis.  Making a 
determination  concerning  a  child’s  best  interest  “does  not  call  for  a  rote  examination  of 
each of Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-1-113(i)’s . . . factors and then a determination of whether 
the sum of factors tips in favor of or against the parent.” In re Audrey S., 182 S.W.3d at 
878.  Rather, “[t]he relevancy and weight to be given each factor depends on the unique 
facts of each case.” Id.  In its order, the trial court made specific findings as to each relevant 
best interest factor8 and determined that all of the factors weighed in favor of terminating 
Mother’s parental rights.  Particularly, the trial court emphasized Mother’s ongoing lack of 
stability and her failure to make any lasting adjustments.  The trial court also highlighted 
the fact that Mother has failed to support Child or maintain regular visitation with Child 
such that there was no meaningful relationship between Mother and Child.  Further, the 
trial  court  determined  that  it  would  be  detrimental  to  Child  if  a  change  in  physical 
environment or custody occurred and that Child needs and deserves permanency, which is 
available with his foster family to whom he has bonded. 

                                           

8  Although not relevant to the issues posed by this particular appeal, we observe that Tennessee 
Code  Annotated  section  36-1-113(i)  was  recently  amended  by  the  General  Assembly  to  incorporate 
additional factors to be considered as part of the best interest analysis under the statute. See 2021 Tenn. 
Pub. Acts, c. 190, §1.  This amended version went into effect on April 22, 2021, well after the filing of the 
petition in this matter, which occurred on October 19, 2020.  As such, we analyze the best interest factors 
as they existed at the time of the filing in this matter. See In re D.A.H., 142 S.W.3d 267, 273 (Tenn. 2004) 
(“[S]tatutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless the legislature clearly indicates otherwise.”).  
- 14 -

We agree with the trial court’s assessment and findings and again note Mother’s 
continued lack of stability and lack of attempts to make any corrective steps towards issues 
that led to Child’s removal.  Child is now thriving in foster care where he has been offered 
stability.  Accordingly, we find that there was clear and convincing evidence in the record 
to support the trial court’s determination that it was in Child’s best interest that Mother’s 
parental rights be terminated. 

CONCLUSION

Based on the foregoing, we affirm the trial court’s termination of Mother’s parental 

rights.
